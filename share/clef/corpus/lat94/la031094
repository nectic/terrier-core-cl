GUNMEN KILL TWO IN BURBANK; VIOLENCE: EXECUTION-STYLE ATTACK ON CAR AT BUSY 
INTERSECTION ALSO LEAVES ONE WOUNDED. SLAYINGS ARE NOT BELIEVED TO BE 
GANG-RELATED.

<P>
 Two gunmen stepped from a car at a busy Burbank intersection Tuesday and fired 
into another vehicle carrying three men, killing two of them and wounding a 
third in an attack that had all the markings of a planned execution, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Police Chief Dave Newsham said it appeared that the killers used 
semiautomatic weapons in the attack at San Fernando Road and Hollywood Way 
shortly after 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings did not appear to be gang-related but did appear planned, Lt. 
Jack Valento said. "It was something that was not spontaneous," Valento said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the victims, all described as adult Latinos in their mid- to late 20s, 
had been identified, Valento said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen approached the victims' white Chevrolet Impala from behind on the 
southbound side of San Fernando Road and opened fire on the occupants, 
authorities said. The car had been stopped at a traffic light. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how many shots were fired, but one witness said he heard at 
least three or four. The car's rear window was shattered by gunfire, and there 
was at least one bullet hole in the right rear passenger window. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Larry Koch said there were "several witnesses who saw all of this or a 
portion of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded driver continued about a mile to a Jack in the Box restaurant in 
the 2600 block of San Fernando Road. By the time police arrived, the bodies of 
his two passengers were in the parking lot of the restaurant; they were 
pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver was treated at St. Joseph Medical Center for a minor gunshot wound 
in the back and released, Valento said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin C. Perez, who works at Industrial Metal Supply Co. across the street 
from the shooting, had just emerged from his car when he heard the shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said two men in dark clothing fired "three, maybe four shots" into the 
car. Immediately after the shooting, the men stepped back into their car and 
fled the wrong way down a one-way section of Hollywood Way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting surprised many of Perez's co-workers, who described the 
neighborhood as a safe and usually quiet place. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably unusual for any area, but particularly for Burbank," Collen 
Canavin said. "This area is really safe, and Burbank (police) keep a tight 
rein," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were five murders in Burbank in 1993, Valento said.

 Deconstructed mysteries: OK, so it wasn't the toughest pop quiz. We asked 
readers to identify a photo in Tuesday's column and we received 194 faxed 
replies -- 195 if you include the misaddressed one from a Venice business 
regarding a customer's deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two guesses were incorrect (and, remember, we count off double for 
incorrect guesses), including: the Spruce Goose airplane (eight votes), a gold 
dredge, the abortive Port Disney resort, a Venetian blind, the Hubble 
telescope, Redondo Pier after a big storm, Angel's Flight, an orbiting 
billboard and Santa Monica's Gateway to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning entry -- a 5:36 a.m. fax -- came from Don Spivack of L.A., who 
said it was a model of "the proposed 'Clouds of Steel' monument, which was to 
be built over the Hollywood Freeway." After consulting our judges -- the people 
who sit closest to us -- we accepted that as close enough to "Steel Cloud." 
Also known as the "West Coast Gateway Monument," the deconstructionist work 
was, you'll recall, touted as L.A.'s own Statue of Liberty. Due to its cost -- 
an estimated $33 million -- it was non-constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, we're shipping Spivack a product titled "Actual Los Angeles Freeway 
Rubble," which somewhat resembles the would-be landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steel clawed: The absence of the freeway monument hasn't made the hearts of 
readers grow fonder, incidentally. Of those who commented on the design, 48 had 
negative comments while three were positive. A sampling of the reviews:  
</P>
<P>
 * "It looks better if you stand it on end." (Lance Richter) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Even the recession has a silver lining." (R. Douglas Collins) 
</P>
<P>
 * "If it had been built, the problem of illegal (and legal, for that matter) 
immigration would have been solved. After all, would you want that to be the 
first thing you saw in the U.S.?" (Norman Gotwetter) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Yuk!" (Mary Caciola) 
</P>
<P>
 * "I love it. Sorry we'll never see it." (Caroline Labiner Moser) 
</P>
<P>
 * "I think I saw it in a junkyard in Carson." (Glenn Barrow) 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, Rick Bowersox was not surprised that the "Steel Cloud" never got 
off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Even Bakersfield got rid of 'Sun-Fun-Stay-Play.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Another needed improvement in spelling: Stan Dyer found a sign in West L.A. 
that bore a name remarkably similar to that of a City Council member. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Pre-shocks: Here's another earthquake clue we missed. "Did anyone notice the 
irony of the (Team Rideshare) TV ad? (that ran before the earthquake)," writes 
Jeff Simpson of La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "It showed the people walking slowly in a dreary mood on the 10 freeway with 
Downtown in the distance. It then cut to the same people doubling up in 
car-pool fashion, whistling, 'Hi ho, hi ho. . . .' I thought it was rather 
amusing, since that's the only way we can traverse the nation's busiest freeway 
now." miscelLAny:

 Actor Jack Nicholson, who was recently charged in a golf club attack on 
another motorist's car, made his directing debut in the film, "Drive He Said."

IN SEARCH OF EXCELLENCE IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS; TEST RESULTS ARE DISMAYING, BUT 
WE NEED HONEST ASSESSMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standards of excellence are not easy to meet, and they are not supposed to be. 
But excellence is more easily aspired to. 
</P>
<P>
 California did just that when it took up the new and academically rigorous 
state testing system dubbed the California Learning Assessment System. The 
first results are in. And those results are, as Acting State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction William D. Dawson put it in notable understatement, "not 
pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 The tests, administered last spring to 1 million public-school students in the 
fourth, eighth and 10th grades, show that California students, even in affluent 
school districts, score abysmally low in math, demonstrating "limited 
mathematical thinking." That was true of at least one-third of all students in 
each grade tested, and that was true of 80% of those tested in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County fared better, but even in the top school districts there, 
two-thirds of students scored at the lowest three levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading and writing scores were better for all students statewide, but they 
still showed significant gaps in comprehension and the ability to express 
themselves clearly and cogently. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, news about disappointing academic performance by California 
students is no longer a novelty. What's different now is that the testing 
system is measuring students against highly challenging state standards. No 
more scoring "on a curve" by comparing students to one another. Now tests are 
"performance-based," allowing students to demonstrate what they have learned, 
and whether they understand what they have learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous tests, which were scored by machines, these tests are scored 
by specially trained teachers. Moreover, eventually each student, not just each 
school, will be evaluated. That will cost about $55 million, a jump of more 
than $40 million over the old testing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag alone will make CLAS the subject of political scrutiny in 
Sacramento. And that virtually guarantees the test will be the object of much 
political heat. It's already started, in fact. The low results are hard to 
swallow for many school administrators, teachers and parents. And no doubt some 
kinks in testing procedures are likely to be found and will need to be worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 But politicians who hold the purse strings to funding the new state test, 
still in its infancy, must not overreact to complaints about it. The CLAS test 
must have a chance to work. It is not a simple proposition to move the nation's 
most populous and diverse state from standardized tests that stress 
memorization and multiple choice to a test that sets out to determine how well 
the state's children are actually being educated. 
</P>
<P>
 California business leaders, who need literate employees able to think on 
their feet, solve complex problems and communicate well with their colleagues 
are depending on the new testing system to improve education standards. Most 
important, California students are depending on the CLAS test to give them an 
honest assessment of how well prepared they are to meet the challenges of the 
21st Century.

'3 STRIKES' COSTS TO TAXPAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Costs to Soar Under '3 Strikes' Plan, Study Says" (March 1) is another 
example of a "detailed study" by the type of bureaucrat that we California 
taxpayers have working on our behalf. There was no mention in this article that 
any officials interviewed had factored into their extrapolations, projecting 
budget doom, a possible reduction in crime, which would result in a reduction 
in projected incarceration rates, hence a subsequent reduction in costs over 
the longer term. Why are the public mood, the Senate vote and simple logic so 
utterly disregarded by the officials quoted? 
</P>
<P>
 LEONARD M. LINTON 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 * Why is everyone making such a fuss over the various "three strikes and 
you're out" proposals when California already has such a law on the books? 
</P>
<P>
 Penal Code Section 667.7, the habitual offender statute, provides that anyone 
convicted of a third violent felony shall be sentenced to life in prison and 
must serve at least 20 years before becoming eligible for parole. Anyone 
convicted of a fourth violent felony receives life without parole. Why do we 
need a new "three strikes and you're out" law when the existing law is 
apparently not being used? Why are the politicians trying to con us into 
believing that "three strikes and you're out" is some sort of radical new 
concept in dealing with violent criminals? 
</P>
<P>
 ARNIE BELL 
</P>
<P>
 Venice 
</P>
<P>
 * Opponents of the "three strikes" proposals harp on the tremendous cost of 
removing these hard-core felons from society, but they never seem to consider 
the enormous savings that the innocent potential victims will enjoy. Get real, 
you guys. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Amazing how we can find $2 billion to build prisons but we can't find $2 
billion to help the kids in the high-crime areas before they grow into such 
desperate adults -- like building recreation centers. Let's admit that our 
"American way of life" is a failure if all we can do is lock people up. 
</P>
<P>
 JUNE ARONSON

</P>
<P>
 * Three strikes and out-of-sight new taxes: What will they be? Business 
corporate tax, personal income tax, real property tax, sales tax, or all of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's share of a $10 billion outlay (the low estimate) would be 
more than $2 billion.

<P>
 * I read with some disbelief the Column Left by Alexander Cockburn (March 1). 
Does he really mean to blame the violence currently rampant in society on 
Vietnam veterans? His figures for this conclusion are somewhat nebulous. His 
hostility for anyone who has worn a uniform is not. It is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 To blame veterans is yet another simplistic solution to a very real problem. 
If columnists and politicians would get off their hobbyhorses and examine the 
many causes of violence, instead of offering single-issue simple solutions, 
they might actually do some good. The idea that the problem of violence can be 
solved by blaming any one group, in this case veterans, is almost as disgusting 
as it is foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 G. E. WARRINGTON 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * Cockburn blames Christopher Golly's killing Los Angeles Police Officer 
Christy Lynne Hamilton, his father, and himself on the fact that the father 
served in Vietnam two decades ago. Cockburn adds that the homicide rate 
invariably goes up after wars, for both victors and losers, veterans and 
non-veterans. In fact, the U.S. homicide rate rose after World War I, fell 
after Korea and rose after Vietnam. Cockburn has every right to express his 
bizarre anti-American opinions, but he has no right to support them with 
invented "facts" that have no basis in reality.

THE TRUE FACE OF INSANITY; EXTREMISTS LOB MORTARS TOWARD LONDON'S HEATHROW 
AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peace is invariably the victim when the extremists are in a position to 
inflict their bitter and irrational pain. That's certainly the case in the 
Middle East, whether the perpetrator is a hardened and trained Hamas operative 
or a fundamentalist Jewish settler who suddenly snaps. And it is the case in 
Northern Ireland, where, it seems, no good deed ever goes unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
 For the hardened criminal elements on both sides of this insatiable hatred, 
the great fear appears to be that reason will get the upper hand, peace will 
settle over the land, and some day -- many years down the road -- the Catholics 
and Protestants of Ulster will live together in relative harmony, as of course 
they do in both Britain and the Republic of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 That prospect is so frightening to the psychotic elements on both extreme ends 
of the political spectrum there that any slight movement forward -- as, for 
example, the recent and highly laudatory efforts of the British and Irish prime 
ministers to find new common ground -- seems to trigger yet another spasm of 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest violent reaction was the attempted mortar bombing of London's 
Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest and most efficient airline terminals in 
the world. No less than four mortars were fired from the back of a vehicle 
toward Britain's chief airport. Not surprisingly, of course, British 
authorities believe the culprits were members of the feared Irish Republican 
Army -- the Hamas-like element of Northern Ireland. Almost miraculously, there 
was no reported damage or serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 As bad as the IRA is -- and its activities are an affront to all civilized 
people -- the other side has its extremists, too. And they have scarcely been 
inactive. Last November, for instance, police authorities intercepted a huge 
clandestine shipment of arms intended for the Unionist Ulster Defense Assn., 
which represents the hard core of the anti-Irish and anti-unionist Protestant 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no gainsaying the vileness on both sides. A recent film -- "In the 
Name of the Father" -- brilliantly dramatizes the deceptions and ineptitudes of 
British security forces when they arrested the wrong suspects in a notorious 
1974 British pub bombing case. While the movie takes many liberties with the 
facts, its central contention -- that the wrong people were imprisoned -- was 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
 What the film fails to convey, however, is the difficulty of coping with such 
violent terrorism in a democratic society that wishes to allow all accused 
people the maximum possible legal protection. Criticisms of the British are 
fair enough, and proper enough; but for perspective, imagine some group firing 
mortal shells from the back of a van at a crowded airport. What you see in that 
picture is the true face of insanity.

GOOD NEWS FROM THE MAGIC KINGDOM; DISNEY'S NEWPORT COAST CONDO PROJECT IS A 
WELCOME ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitchmen for time-share resorts too often resemble old-time carnival barkers, 
with buyers later cursing the failure to keep their wallets shut. Now the Walt 
Disney Co. may help change the industry's image. 
</P>
<P>
 For an estimated $25 million, Disney has bought 35 acres at Newport Coast, 
midway between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach and not too far from Disneyland. 
The company is expected shortly to buy another 35 acres of this stretch of 
undeveloped ocean-view property. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for 650 condominiums ranging in size from studios to three-bedroom 
units, with buyers getting the right to stay in units for specified periods. 
The project, which will also include shops and restaurants, may be marketed as 
part of the Disney Vacation Club, which lets members buy time at the company 
resort in Orlando, near Disney World, and others planned in Vero Beach, Fla., 
and Hilton Head, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The time-share development still needs federal, state and local approval, but 
the condominiums have not drawn public opposition because they replace a 
planned hotel whose backers could not obtain financing. If the Disney project 
goes forward, it could be a refreshing display of confidence in the regional 
economy, especially in tandem with the possible expansion of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The time-share industry has been known for hard sells, with potential buyers 
lured to sales meetings with promises of meals and gifts. Some developments 
were accused of selling too many time-share weeks and not letting buyers swap 
vacation times. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a trade-group representative expressed hope that Disney could help 
spruce up the image of time-sharing projects, it is unrealistic to expect the 
company to solve the industry's problems. Indeed, with a still anemic economy 
and a glut of time shares across the country, the company will have to fight 
for success. But if the project works out and increases tourism here, it can 
provide a needed economic boost.

SHERVEN ON FEMINISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * While I certainly concur with Judith Sherven's assertion that "sexual 
harassment cannot ever be eradicated" precisely because it is in the eye of the 
beholder, I find it astonishing that she deems the desire for a lack of sexual 
harassment to be "small" and "narcissistic" (Commentary, March 2). 
</P>
<P>
 Does she truly believe that employees or students, male or female, whose job 
security or academic grade are tied to their willingness to endure sexually 
explicit requests, compliments and outright sexual encounters to be romantic, 
narcissistic whiners if they are not empowered by their dehumanizing reality, 
and that they are "dependent" and "squeamish" to raise their voices in protest? 
Does she believe that to want something better, that to strive to improve an 
injustice is disempowering? If one were to follow that line of thought, then 
Martin Luther King's dream is a whiny fantasy.  
</P>
<P>
 She has contrived broad and unsupported generalizations from the most extreme 
of examples (i.e., the woman who sued a rose-giving co-worker) to make the case 
that sexual harassment really doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, the complaining! As a successful, professional woman and the daughter of a 
clinical psychologist for 30 years, I am afraid for her patients. As long as 
life isn't fair (in other words, forever), there will be people courageous 
enough to point it out in an effort to make life even just a little more 
equitable for everyone. If that makes me a small, innocent and fragile pansy, 
so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 ANDI ACKERMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Sherven's article is right on target. 
</P>
<P>
 Time was when a rose, an appreciative glance, a whistle or even a suggestive 
remark were considered innocent flirtations. If it went further than that a 
sharp-witted woman could always put a man in his place, without making an 
enemy, without screaming for help and without a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the advent of NOW (National Organization for Women), I did not realize 
I was unequal. I was one of the first women stockbrokers in the L.A. area with 
a major brokerage house. I was the "House Broad" in three brokerage houses. I 
was thrilled by the opportunity to prove myself, despite the fact that I had to 
run twice as fast as my male counterparts to achieve and despite the 
smart-aleck remarks from my male confreres. You see, in those days we did not 
call it sexual harassment or take umbrage at it. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought being a woman in a "man's world" was an advantage and not a 
handicap. I was hired by management because they thought I would attract more 
women clients. That ended up not being the case. I had as many male as female 
clients. I was not a victim. I was the victor. All women in the business world 
today are victors.

GAS SHUT-OFF VALVES

 * The recent newscasts showing home and mobile home fires fed by gas from gas 
pipes broken by the earthquake remind me that over a year ago we installed gas 
valves that automatically shut off during earthquakes, in buildings with 160 
apartments, at a cost of thousands of dollars, for both tenant and owner 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Southern California Gas Co. insisted that these valves be 
removed, claiming that the Gas Co. would control gas fires from a central 
station.It's too bad the Gas Co. didn't act to save many of the recently burned 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Gas Co., with the experience of the recent earthquake, should review 
this policy and be more concerned about public safety.

SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Those of us who have lost someone to lung cancer know the painful truth of 
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elder's simple words, "Tobacco addicts and it kills" 
(Feb. 25). 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for bringing this issue to the forefront in your editorial, "Smoke 
Gets in Lawmakers' Brains" (Feb. 27).All Californians need to write letters and 
speak out now in an effort to help clear the smoke out of the lawmakers' brains 
so that they will finally pass the state's workplace smoking ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto's first biochemical proof of secondhand smoke dangers supports the 
fact that smoking is a serious public health issue needing a public health 
solution. It must be treated as the addiction that it is. We need low-cost 
government supported programs to aid people in quitting. We also need money 
allotted for programs to go into the schools to reach children and teen-agers, 
the group that is seeing an alarming rise in smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Like drugs, teen-agers need to be taught not to give in to peer pressure on 
this issue.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's not simply castigate the smoker for his fatal and human mistake while we 
sit back and do nothing in the way of a solution.

 * Your editorial urging that "California should show the way by finally 
passing its own workplace smoking ban" is worrisome to me, as an entrepreneur 
and a pipe smoker. California has been trying to "show the way" for years with 
all types of well-intentioned taxes, regulations and state interference -- but 
what we're doing all too frequently is showing the way to Nevada, Arizona, 
Texas and other states less inclined to meddle with their residents.

'DOWNSIZING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Barry Glassner's " 'Downsizings' Translate to Human Misery," 
Column Left, Feb. 24: 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Glassner obviously knows as much about how to run a corporation as you 
would expect from someone in an ivory-tower sociology department. I guess if 
his department budget were cut, he would borrow or take out of his own salary 
whatever he needed to continue to pay all his assistants! 
</P>
<P>
 There is a difference between stock price and bottom line, which is what 
causes layoffs. I should hope Glassner should know. I also hope Glassner 
doesn't feel that he is the only person to understand the relationship between 
layoffs and stock prices. "Downsizings" will improve as a function of recovery 
worldwide, and by decreased government taxes and mandates against business!

COLUMN LEFT / ERIC MANN / CHRIS MATHIS: POOR PEOPLE AGAIN TAKE THE TOXIC BRUNT; 
PROPOSED AIR-POLLUTION RULES FOR THE L.A. BASIN REWARD ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MANN and CHRIS MATHIS, Eric Mann is the director of the Labor/Community 
Strategy Center in Los Angeles. Chris Mathis is lead organizer of the center's 
environmental organization, Watchdog. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For many people who know of the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
from its own press releases, the agency's image as a hard-hitting, even 
Draconian, enforcer of anti-pollution laws is still in the air. But our members 
have attended more than 30 board meetings over the past four years and our 
direct experience has been chilling. We have seen AQMD board members calling a 
public hearing and then walking off to have lunch while people testified to a 
dais of empty chairs. We have organized people from Wilmington, South-Central 
and East L.A. to take a day off from work only to have the AQMD insult 
community representatives and refuse to provide the promised translation for 
Spanish speakers. We have walked into meetings with an impressive multiracial 
grass-roots delegation of more than 100 people only to be confronted by an army 
of more than 250 paid lobbyists, all of them able to call each board member by 
first name. 
</P>
<P>
 This leads us to have little hope of affecting the AQMD's crucial vote Friday 
on air quality near industrial plants. But we have to try, because the AQMD 
board is on the verge of legalizing dangerous quantities of toxic emissions 
from industrial sources in the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary AQMD mandate under the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce 
smog-producing chemicals -- oxides of nitrogen, ozone, particulate matter and 
carbon monoxide. But smog is not the only problem, and the AQMD has identified 
89 chemicals as air toxics, meaning they have been determined to cause cancer, 
leukemia, severe damage to the central nervous, respiratory, reproductive and 
immune systems, and more. Poor communities and people of color are 
disproportionately affected by such poisons, and their civil rights are being 
violated by the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
 Some history: In 1987, the Legislature passed the Air Toxics Information Act, 
giving "hot spot" communities the formal right to know the chemicals to which 
they are exposed and their known health dangers. The AQMD was told to write 
letters to residents in plain language, disclosing emissions and their risks. 
It was never enforced. In 1992, after five years of AQMD inaction, the 
Labor/Community Strategy Center, Mothers of East Los Angeles (Santa Isabel) and 
Concerned Citizens of South-Central L.A. pushed the agency to rule that any 
facility posing a significant risk level of 10 additional cancers per million 
people exposed would trigger AQMD warning letters to affected residents and 
mandate meetings between the community and the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, not one major polluter has complied with that law, and the 
AQMD has not enforced it. As Wilmington environmental activist Carlos Molina 
told the board recently, "Low-income communities of color suffer from severe 
health problems because of air pollution. You acted sympathetic but then turned 
around and . . . stabbed us in the back." 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD caved in to industry with its "pollution-trading" credits. Now it is 
pushing ahead with a plan to set incredibly lax standards for toxic chemicals 
from industry -- including the right for each company to emit poisons that 
would cause up to 100 extra lifetime cancers in a population of 1 million. The 
desirable standard is 1 per million. We would settle for 10. Not 99.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping against hope that the AQMD might listen, we propose that the 
rule-making be postponed for a year, during which time the "right to know" rule 
would be enforced, in order to give affected communities the knowledge they 
need to participate in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 After that year, the AQMD should mandate emission reductions in three 
categories: 
</P>
<P>
 * Firms that pose the greatest risk to the "maximum exposed individual" -- a 
hypothetical person receiving the highest possible dose. 
</P>
<P>
 * Firms that expose the largest number of people to risk, such as the Arco 
refinery in Carson that exposes more than 13,000 people to toxic emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Firms that emit the largest quantities of toxics per year, such as Arco, 
with 485,000 pounds per year, or Texaco's Wilmington oil refinery, with more 
than 240,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The communities must have a voice in this rule-making. Currently, AQMD rules 
are heavily influenced by representatives of the oil, chemical, metal-plating, 
dry cleaning and aerospace industries. If the new emission rules are approved, 
the battle will continue, whether in the media, in the courts, in the streets 
or all three. The AQMD should not think it will be able to breathe easily.

PERSPECTIVE ON AIDS; SAFER SEX HAS TO BE FOREVER; IF HUMAN BEHAVIOR TRIGGERED 
THE EPIDEMIC, HUMAN BEHAVIOR COULD QUELL IT. BUT THAT CALLS FOR PERMANENT 
CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABRIEL ROTELLO, Gabriel Rotello is a columnist for New York Newsday and was 
editor in chief of the now-defunct gay and lesbian newsweekly, OutWeek. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gay and AIDS activists, even at the risk of providing fodder for homophobes, 
need to examine how AIDS developed, and the reason is soberingly simple. 
Researchers are virtually unanimous in believing that if AIDS were cured 
tomorrow and we returned to the ways of the 1970s, the whole nightmare could 
easily happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists are confident that what can be amplified by one form of human 
behavior can be prevented by another. Among the most critical contributions the 
gay community has made in responding to AIDS has been the invention and 
promotion of safer sex, which remains the most important means of preventing 
HIV transmission today. Overcoming great resistance, gay men and lesbians -- 
after a period of adjustment -- reacted with remarkable decisiveness, 
effectiveness and often nobility to the challenge of safer sex. The most 
impressive evidence of this was a subsequently lowered rate of HIV transmission 
in places like San Francisco, where the epidemic was at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
 But an important reason for examining the genesis of the epidemic itself is to 
lay the framework for prevention on a macro scale -- not individual cases, but 
of AIDS II: the Sequel. Researchers have already identified several microbes 
capable of spawning deadly new plagues if the conditions of the 1970s are 
re-created, starting, most obviously, with HIV-2 and the cancer-causing HTLV 
retroviruses. Now drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted 
diseases have evolved, making these infections harder to treat, especially for 
those with HIV. There are probably many others -- rare, death-dealing microbes 
-- unnoticed as HIV was long unnoticed, eking out a meager existences in the 
global bloodstream. Waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as we move into the second decade of AIDS without a cure in sight, many 
cannot resist the siren song of unsafe sex. According to the San Francisco 
health department, the rate of newly infected gay men recently doubled in the 
Bay Area, with many cases among young gay men. Epidemiologists say the same 
thing is happening in other gay communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus groups have elicited several explanations for the relapse, including 
fatalism, survivor guilt and a desire to join what some bizarrely consider a 
culture of heightened meaning among the HIV-positive. But a significant reason 
gay men gave investigators was the belief that safer sex is just too stressful, 
even unnatural, to maintain for very long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Safe sex is not incorporated naturally into a life," a Bay Area man told 
reporter Jane Gross of the New York Times recently. "OK, three years; OK, five 
years; OK, eight years. But the rest of my life? No. That's not possible." His 
view is widely echoed even by many who practice safer sex but who look forward 
to the end of AIDS not just for personal salvation or the salvation of their 
friends but so that they can return to the multipartner practices of the 
swinging '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps ironically, those practices are now becoming more popular within 
lesbian circles even as AIDS rises among women. Yet the lesson of AIDS, or at 
least one lesson of AIDS, is that until all viruses have been defeated, the 
kind of gay sexual activism that has contributed to AIDS remains incompatible 
with survival. If gay men in particular are to survive, the real challenge of 
liberation will not be to resist that lesson but to organize around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if such a major readjustment is possible, many would view it with deep 
suspicion. Historian Martin Duberman cites powerful arguments against accepting 
any seemingly moralistic, anti-sex lesson from AIDS: "The powers that be have 
always used epidemics in order to reinforce moral lessons. And epidemics, 
because they involve so much terror, are very good enforcers of the code." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. But in the past, the powers that be did not know the facts about 
plagues. It is one thing for moralists to misinterpret epidemics as God's wrath 
and use such interpretations to suggest tattooing gays. It is quite another for 
rationalists to explore the interlinked mechanisms of epidemics and provide 
resulting knowledge that can be applied to prevention and protection. 
</P>
<P>
 To be effective on the individual level, we have learned that safer sex has to 
be every time. The history of AIDS indicates that to be effective on the macro 
level, it will have to be all the time, for all humankind. And not just for the 
duration of the epidemic. Forever. Or at least until the viral world has been 
vanquished.

CROWD VOICES LOW OPINION OF KINGS; HOCKEY: BOOS REIGN DOWN AS 4-0 LOSS TO 
BLACKHAWKS LEAVES STANLEY CUP FINALISTS SEVEN POINTS BEHIND IN PLAYOFF RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The soundtrack to the Kings' alleged playoff push was punctuated by boos all 
around. At least there was some life and emotion from the sellout crowd of 
16,005 at the Forum.  
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, none of those attributes were evident from the Kings in a 4-0 loss 
to the Chicago Blackhawks on Wednesday night. The Blackhawks were the ones who 
looked as if they needed to make up ground in the race for the final playoff 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if Chicago had played the previous night? 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks chased down every loose puck, almost every rebound. They even 
managed to work the puck around on the power play. And they were able to carry 
the puck into the zone without going offside some of the time.  
</P>
<P>
 These basic concepts seemed to elude the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 They have but one victory in their last 13 games, going 1-8-4, and are 0-5-2 
in their last seven at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awful," King Coach Barry Melrose said. "Maybe this game is good 
because we were so terrible and so awful, the guys have to do some 
soul-searching. I can't pick one player who played well. We haven't got a team 
that wants to make the playoffs. They're hoping to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a team of fat cats that doesn't want to pay the price. . . . There are 
no excuses. They're not doing the job and I'm not doing the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wayne Gretzky: "Maybe his comments should have been made four months ago. 
We're living on past history. We can't do that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The review from the fans was succinct. They booed the obligatory 
public-address announcement of the sellout, chanting, "Refund, refund." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't even get to see a King goal -- from Gretzky or anyone else. 
Gretzky, without a goal in three consecutive games, remains three away from 
tying and four from breaking Gordie Howe's NHL record of 801. His last goal was 
last Wednesday in Hartford. He had two shots on goal against the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, Gretzky has never scored against Chicago goaltender Ed Belfour. 
"That's pretty impressive when you look at how many goals Wayne has scored," 
Chicago Coach Darryl Sutter said. "For him not to have scored a goal on Eddie 
is quite an accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Belfour, who shut out the Mighty Ducks on Tuesday at a neutral-site game in 
Phoenix, has recorded consecutive shutouts and has not given up a goal in 131 
minutes 22 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just goes to show what kind of a team we have here," said Belfour, who 
faced 23 shots in his seventh shutout of the season. "We've been playing a 
defensive game and we really take a lot of pride in it." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Kings, they have been shut out six times this season. With 17 games 
remaining, the Kings (22-35-10) have steadily lost ground in the race for the 
final playoff spot in the Western Conference. Before Sunday's action, they were 
five points behind the eighth-place San Jose Sharks. Now, the margin is seven 
points and the Sharks play the New York Islanders tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks got offensive production from their usual sources. Joe Murphy 
scored once and added two assists, and Jeremy Roenick had a goal and two 
assists. Michel Goulet scored his 14th goal of the season and 546th of his NHL 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose is clearly baffled by his players, who called a team meeting late 
Wednesday night. "Something will blow up, either me or something else," he 
said. "They mean a lot to me. To see them as a shadow of last season's team, 
it's been very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky were among those who attended John 
Candy's funeral service on Wednesday in Brentwood. Candy, who was an avid King 
fan and co-owner of the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League with 
Gretzky and McNall, died of a heart attack in Mexico on Friday. . . . 
Defenseman Doug Houda returned to the lineup after sitting out three 
consecutive games because of a separated right shoulder. The scratches were 
defenseman Jim Paek and forwards Dave Taylor, Tony Granato, Phil Crowe and Dave 
Thomlinson. . . . Former King goaltender Gary Edwards filled in for radio color 
commentator Brian Engblom, who was working out of town for ESPN2 on Wednesday 
night.

 Fleet Seen Focusing on Layoffs to Cut Costs: Fleet Financial Group Inc., the 
largest banking company in New England, is expected to lay off more than 3,000 
employees, or more than 11% of its work force, as part of a restructuring that 
could save as much as $225 million annually, analysts said. Fleet is expected 
to release details today of the long-discussed restructuring. Fleet, based in 
Providence, R.I., is likely to close several of its 800 branches and reduce its 
subsidiaries to six from seven by consolidating New York operations, analysts 
said.

 Ford to Boost Production: The auto maker, enjoying strong demand for its cars 
and trucks, plans to boost its North American output by about 300,000 units 
this year, Chairman Alex Trotman said. The move will lift Ford's production 
capacity in the United States and Canada to 5.1 million units a year. Most of 
the increase will be in higher production of the restyled Ford Mustang, the new 
Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, the F-Series pickups and the new Ford 
Windstar minivan.

 Britain OKs Non-Prescription Tagamet: SmithKline Beecham said the British 
Department of Health has approved its best-selling peptic ulcer drug for 
over-the-counter sale.It is the first time Tagamet 100 has been approved for 
non-prescription sale anywhere, a company spokesman said. Marketing the drug 
directly to consumers is expected to boost Tagamet's declining market share. 
Last year, prescription sales declined 6% from the year before. The patent for 
Tagamet expires in the United States in May, and analysts are concerned that 
SmithKline revenue could be badly hurt by generic competition.

 Korean Release Canceled: Responding to threats of boycotts and picket lines, 
Warner Bros. Korea has canceled its scheduled release in Seoul next week of 
"Falling Down," starring Michael Douglas. The film, which also prompted 
controversy when it opened in the United States last year, includes a scene in 
which a Korean American grocer, accused of overcharging for a can of soda, is 
beaten and his store destroyed by an assailant with a baseball bat. Korean 
critics say that the film is racist and promotes racial violence.

 Lawrence Release Postponed: The release of raunchy comedian Martin Lawrence's 
much-publicized concert film "You So Crazy," scheduled for March 18, has been 
postponed indefinitely. The move will allow distributor Miramax to "figure out 
their options" in light of a restrictive NC-17 rating, which makes the film 
difficult to book into theaters. TELEVISION

 'Shift'-ing to HBO: HBO Pictures has optioned film and television production 
rights to "The Late Shift," the best-selling book about Jay Leno and David 
Letterman's behind-the-scenes maneuvering to succeed Johnny Carson on "The 
Tonight Show." Written by New York Times television reporter Bill Carter, the 
book is the nonfiction account of the late-night world already depicted on HBO 
through Garry Shandling's satire "The Larry Sanders Show." "This is perfect for 
HBO," said Robert Cooper, senior president of HBO Pictures. "It is a unique, 
outrageous and often hilarious look at the wheeling and dealing in the world of 
television. It's a 'Barbarians at the Gate,' but this time in our own back 
yard. It's going to be a challenge to make, and that is exactly why we want to 
make it." HBO has not yet set a writer, director or producer for the project.

 Conangla Leaves KCBS: Chris Conangla quietly left KCBS-TV Channel 2 as anchor 
of the 5 p.m. newscast last Thursday when his contract with the station ended. 
"The newscast is in third or fourth place in the ratings," said general manager 
Bill Applegate. "He's been anchor for a long time. The newscast is not 
succeeding. That means it's time for change." Michael Tuck has been anchoring 
both the 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts to fill in for Conangla. Applegate said he does 
not yet know whether that situation will be permanent. Conangla said that he is 
in negotiations with several stations in other markets and will probably leave 
Los Angeles.

 All in the Family: The illegitimate son of the late rocker Jimi Hendrix sued 
his grandfather in Los Angeles Superior Court Tuesday, claiming he is the 
musician's sole heir and entitled to his estate. James Henrik Daniel Sundquist, 
24, says a Swedish court legally designated him the rocker's son in 1975, 
despite the objections of his grandfather, James (Al) Hendrix, whom Sundquist 
contends has actively concealed his right to a share of Jimi Hendrix's estate. 
Also named as defendants are Hendrix's longtime attorney, Hendrix estate 
executors and a handful of companies believed to hold the rights to Jimi 
Hendrix's works. Sundquist says he is the product of a 1969 union between Jimi 
Hendrix and Eva Sundquist that took place in Stockholm while the guitarist was 
on tour with his band. Hendrix died in 1970 of a drug overdose. QUICK TAKES

 Soul diva Toni Braxton's smash showing at the Grammys helped catapult her 
9-month-old, self-titled debut album to the top of the nation's pop chart, 
selling more than 104,000 units last week. Pop rapper Hammer's "The Funky 
Headhunter" entered the chart at No. 12 with sales of about 62,000 units, and 
alternative folk-rock singer Beck's "Mellow Gold" captured the No. 15 spot, 
selling an estimated 59,000 units in its first week. . . . Although there's 
still no official word on casting to replace star Michael Moriarty, NBC has 
proclaimed its faith in the drama "Law & Order" by announcing the show will 
return for a fifth season in the fall. So far, the actor most often mentioned 
to replace the disgruntled Moriarty is former "I'll Fly Away" star Sam 
Waterston. SHAUNA SNOW

MOVIE REVIEW; BYRNE'S 'BETWEEN THE TEETH': MUSIC TAKES THE FRONT SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 David Byrne and salsa music make classic star-crossed lovers. His yelpy, 
existential New York nervousness and the Latin music's tightly played, 
jubilantly felt release are unlikely enough suitors that only in irony the 
twain shall really meet, but there's a good amount of fun in the attempt. 
"Between the Teeth," an unadorned movie rendering of Byrne's 1992 tour, 
effectively documents the multicultural mirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it pales within the large shadow cast by 1984's "Stop Making 
Sense," arguably the best concert movie ever, filmed before Byrne made the bad 
career move of breaking up Talking Heads. Lately he's been less a rock force to 
be reckoned with than a commercially negligible pop anthropologist, rendering 
the solo album this tour was promoting, "Uh-Oh," a sales stiff. And Byrne's own 
co-direction of this filmic follow-up (with David Wild) follows the model 
Jonathan Demme set down with "Sense" -- keep it simple, while shooting each 
song with a different philosophy of lighting, camera movement and editing -- 
without really expanding on it. 
</P>
<P>
 But if diminished expectations are the order of the day, "Teeth" still has a 
pretty sharp sonic bite to it. Byrne's nine-piece backup band -- including such 
heroes of world-beat as Cuban percussionist Oscar Salas and ex-Meters bassist 
George Porter Jr., plus a very busy horn section -- cooks up a swell funk, 
equally percussive but more Brazil-based than "Sense's" African-dominated 
polyrhythms. For more xenophobic fans, there's a fair amount of Talking Heads 
traditionalism in the song choices and overall sound, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The best visual moments take in the scope of the big band on stage. But for 
variety, presumably, some songs leave the camera lingering tightly on the 
middle two-thirds of Byrne's sweat-beaded face, leaving lots of time to ponder 
whether he really does have anything caught between his teeth or not. For most 
fans the best bet may be to wait for the video or laser disc to come out and 
make an audiotape copy for the car. In lieu of dancing, the Byrne band's 
hyperdrive makes better music to motor to than to sit placidly through.

CLUB REVIEW; DESPITE DRAB DECOR, PAN SPRINGS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Perhaps because Silver Lake rates as a low-key locale on the hipster club 
spectrum, Pan -- a new Thursday night club at Dreamz -- is a comfortably 
inviting scene.  
</P>
<P>
 With its truck-stop interior and drab decor, Pan is a great example of how a 
venue can spring to life with a bit of ingenuity and some good music. 
</P>
<P>
 With its eclectic music selection and a backdrop of five video monitors 
looping continuous images of the Unarians -- sect members who wear outer space 
costumes and wait to be beamed up by a higher life form -- Pan makes life on 
earth seem pretty cool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although last week the club featured an inspired live show by the psychedelic 
blues-funk trio Mecolodiacs, you can generally count on the wide-ranging music 
taste of deejay Reverend Mauricio Figuls. From the funky '70s sounds of War's 
"Spill the Wine" and Rufus' "Tell Me Something Good" to Tom Jones' version of 
"Ring of Fire" and the Tikis' "Surfadelic," Figuls creates a unique strain of 
dance fever. 
</P>
<P>
 Pan seems to draw an effortlessly mixed group of people, from neighborhood 
Latinos to club-goers from South-Central and Hollywood. After a few more 
selections from Marvin Gaye, David Bowie and the Ohio Players, you're reminded 
that there really is something for everyone here.

 Don't get steamed, Barney. One of the hottest-selling kidvids going is the 
Alphabet Factory's "Firetrucks to the Rescue," a parade of historic and modern 
real-life fire trucks, equipment and action scenes set to a John Phillips Sousa 
beat. The tapes are also used by fire departments across the country to teach 
fire safety, and Alphabet Factory, a company that specializes in factual, "how 
does it work" videos, is offering to donate the tapes free of charge to fire 
departments for that purpose. Interested fire officials can call Douglas Katz 
at (800) 852-1479. Interested consumers can order the tapes for $19.95 plus 
shipping by calling (800) 862-0616.

ART REVIEWS; LANNAN'S 'PERCEPT': INTENSE, RIGOROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The exhibition "Percept/Image/Object" pinpoints the differences between seeing 
and knowing. At the Lannan Foundation, seeing isn't believing, and knowing 
isn't what we thought it was. 
</P>
<P>
 In the foyer, nine small lithographs by Gerhard Richter alert us to the fact 
that art doesn't always obey the rules of the ordinary world. In one picture, 
the armature of a cube sits in a lawn chair. Closer inspection reveals that 
this geometric form behaves like a pretzel. Its straight edges defy the laws of 
perspective, twisting pictorial space and entangling us in perplexing 
illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 A mesmerizing installation by James Turrell plays out similar contradictions 
in three dimensions. In a dark chamber, a shimmering blue cube hovers in the 
opposite corner. As you approach it, the cube suddenly appears to be a 
rectangle cut out of the adjoining walls. 
</P>
<P>
 With unsettling effectiveness, Turrell seems to magically transform a solid 
volume into an empty void. Only when the shadow of your head eclipses his trick 
do you realize that the blue cube is simply light projected on walls painted a 
highly reflective titanium white. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you know the source of Turrell's illusion, its capacity to stun 
diminishes. In the main gallery, Robert Irwin's wall-mounted disk creates 
similar sensations, at first disrupting space with an elusive optical glitch, 
then fading into an exceptionally clever visual game. 
</P>
<P>
 The other artists abandon such illusionism. Jackie Winsor's inscrutable cube, 
made of cheesecloth stretched taut over a wooden frame, sits vulnerably on the 
floor. Two abstract canvases by Ad Reinhardt demand painstaking concentration, 
rewarding the effort by drifting out of focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Ray's "Rotating Circle" turns perception into a physically threatening 
exercise. Perfectly set in the wall, the rapidly spinning disk is almost 
invisible. Its 3,500 revolutions per minute look like absolute stillness, but 
pack a walloping conceptual punch. If you touch the disk to prove that what you 
see is what you know, you risk real pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Perversely fascinating are the works by Tom Friedman. These include 3,000 
garbage bags, stuffed one inside another; a stack of Lifesaver candies 
incrementally licked toward invisibility; a sheet of note-paper punched 
thousands of times with a pin and a hair-thin wire balanced on end. All of his 
pieces teeter maddeningly on the edge between utter inconsequentiality and 
awesome patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Two multi-panel paintings by John M. Miller are initially daunting. Their 
apparently inflexible patterns are too complex to apprehend rationally. They 
force intuition to the forefront of experience, momentarily aligning perception 
and cognition. Endlessly engaging, Miller's dazzling works encapsulate the 
strongest impulses of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 This concise selection of paintings, prints, sculptures, drawings and 
installations from the Lannan collection includes works by eight artists rarely 
shown together, spans 40 years (or three generations), and draws from Los 
Angeles, New York and Germany. The confident mastery with which 
"Percept/Image/Object" was organized matches the intensity and rigor of its 
works. Both demand that we shake off lazy habits, abandon untested assumptions 
and experience our visual environment afresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, an exhibition like this won't be organized again. Since the 
Lannan Foundation recently announced it has stopped collecting contemporary 
art, its holdings have been cut off from the dynamism and excitement of ongoing 
projects. Without an active connection to the present, the Lannan's impressive 
collection will become a static, closed set of objects that can be rearranged 
but never reinvigorated.

Closed Mondays.

 Emotional Appeal: A quick description of Catherine Howe's paintings makes them 
sound like pat, politically correct exercises. However, the young New Yorker's 
six large canvases at Kim Light Gallery are too odd to be dismissed so easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Five supple paintings in the main gallery depict attractive black women 
wearing summer dresses and casually standing before snazzy backdrops. These 
fields resemble soft versions of Clyfford Still's hard, jarring abstractions 
from the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back gallery, a lone white woman poses stiffly in a smarmy field of 
pastel smears. Her pinched expression conveys the distastefulness of 
over-studied spontaneity. Likewise, the background combines the vigorous 
brushwork of Willem de Kooning with the fluffiness of cotton candy. 
</P>
<P>
 To see Howe's images exclusively in terms of art historical references is to 
miss much of their intrigue. Despite predominant interpretations, her paintings 
are not simplistic feminist send-ups of Abstract Expressionism. Howe's skills 
as a painter save her work from being merely critical. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of her art is the contradictory presence of its figures. They 
simultaneously possess the fleshiness of real bodies and the intangibility of 
memories. Emotional appeal -- and its attendant risks -- put an uncanny spin on 
Howe's strangely intimate paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kim Light Gallery, 126 N. La Brea Ave., (213) 933-9816, through April 9. 
Closed Sundays and Mondays.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Only the Ordinary: Ray Smith's four multi-panel paintings and 10 small 
watercolors at Ruth Bloom Gallery fail to live up to the promise of his earlier 
hallucinatory pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old Texas-born artist was raised in Mexico and now splits his time 
between New York and Cuernavaca. He has either settled into a boring, formulaic 
phase of his career or shipped leftovers to his first solo show in Los Angeles, 
presumably saving better works for more important exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the standard themes of Surrealism are present in Smith's art, they 
seem to be heartlessly put through their paces. Sexual desire, bodily disgust, 
subconscious associations and fantastic animal transformations still occur, but 
with too much control to resonate. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's current allusions lack the hilarious unpredictability that sometimes 
animates his paintings. His wildly imaginative cast of characters has shrunk to 
include only ordinary people and realistic ducks, fish, frogs and squid. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith typically depicts colorful amphibians clinging to the naked bodies of 
slender women. He also renders fully clothed men whose heads are covered by 
octopi or shellfish. The largest painting portrays his son in a bathtub full of 
ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Overly literal, these lifeless pictures eliminate the Sphinx-like enigma that 
once made Smith's work compelling. Too little room is left for psychological 
ambivalence or mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruth Bloom Gallery, 2036 Broadway, Santa Monica, (310) 829-7454, through 
April 9. Closed Mondays.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Dynamic Cycle: Fantastic animals stare at their mirror images in Rodrigo 
Pimentel's new paintings on canvas and paper. Titled "Reflections," the Mexican 
artist's 14 diptychs at Iturralde Gallery are bolder and more direct than his 
earlier, abstractly patterned works. 
</P>
<P>
 Each pair of paintings consists of a vibrantly colored creature juxtaposed to 
its double. The reversed versions are painted as if they were bathed in the 
light of the moon. Shimmering silvers, bluish grays and shadowy whites contrast 
to the hot, circus colors of their daytime counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pimentel's menagerie, night is never opposed to day, nor is good inflexibly 
set against evil. Both play off one another, creating a dynamic cycle. Life and 
death, joy and suffering, violence and love are subsumed in a complex, ongoing 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Like pictures in children's story-books, Pimentel's paintings describe an 
enchanted, magical world. Fierce beasts look more amiable than threatening. 
With easy-to-understand simplicity, they embody human sentiments and convey 
profound wisdom. 
</P>

 The Los Angeles area finally has a store stocking nothing but chile pepper 
products. Among Hot Hot Hot's 320 or so spicy offerings (which include Scorned 
Woman Sauce and I Am on Fire Ready to Die), you can even find one suitable for 
St. Patrick's Day, Clancy's Fancy. Trends in the boutique hot sauce world, 
reports co-owner Monica Bosserman Lopez, are unusual sauce bases (mango has 
been done, so now there are things like a yam-based habanero sauce called 
Flying Burrito Flounder Juice) and sauces even hotter than habanero (such as 
Dave's Insanity Sauce, made with industrial capsaicin extract). For those who 
truly can't get enough, the store stocks a brand of coffee beans roasted with 
cumin and jalapenos which Lopez privately describes as "silly." Hot Hot Hot is 
at 56 S. Delacey St., Pasadena. Pizzas for Literacy

 This is the 125th anniversary of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel "War and Peace." In

</P>
<P>
 In order to make Guinness, the Peanut Advisory Board (with the help of Peanut, 
Penn., high school students) made a sandwich using 75 pounds of peanut butter 
and 50 pounds of jelly last year. Guinness sandwich rules require a continuous 
piece of bread, so a 37-foot loaf was baked at the local Pizza Hut. The 
pizzeria's front window had to be removed to get it out of the building. After 
being displayed at the local peanut butter festival, the giant sandwich was 
donated to a community food bank. White House Kitchen Firing 
</P>
<P>
 It was reported last week that White House chef Pierre Chambrin and three 
assistants have been asked to leave by the end of the month. The reason is 
reportedly that Chambrin cooks nothing but rich French food, while the Clintons 
prefer American food, preferably low-fat. (Curiously, pastry chef Roland 
Mesnier was not asked to resign.) A chef was asked to resign during the Reagan 
tenure, but this is the first time an entire White House kitchen staff has been 
shown the door. An Ice-Cold Reproof 
</P>
<P>
 Coors Brewing Co., which spends heavily on literacy programs, is getting a lot 
of flack for a product named Artic (sic) Ice. But if they'd spelled it Arctic, 
Coors claims, they couldn't have trademarked the name. "Miller didn't spell 
'Lite' right either," retorted a spokeswoman. Mussels Spared the Curse of Dermo 
</P>
<P>
 The hot news in mussel-raising is chub ladders -- tubes hung from floats to 
provide baby oysters a safe place to grow, away from suffocating mud and hungry 
predators. They grow twice as fast as regular oysters, which means they're more 
likely to reach harvestable weight without being attacked by oyster diseases 
such as dermo and MSX. CHARLES PERRY

 Pity the peanut. It's not a pea and it's not really a nut. Even so, most 
people around the world insist on treating it as one or the other. They roast 
it (here and there -- in China, parts of Africa and the American South) or they 
boil it. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's ground fine enough, though, this oil-rich cousin of the fava bean 
shows its real potential. Our national taste for peanut butter (See "E Pluribus 
Chunky," H10) has made it a basic element in American cookie-, candy- and 
cake-making. In Latin America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and Africa, ground 
peanuts show up in sauces and stews.  
</P>
<P>
 The peanut is a South American original, a shrub whose flowers send tendrils 
into the ground where they grow into seed pods. It was domesticated about 4,000 
years ago in the eastern foothills of the Andes, somewhere around the border 
between Bolivia and Argentina. And very thoroughly domesticated; it's one of 
the few plants in the world that is never found in the wild. By the time of 
Columbus, it had spread throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground peanuts enter into cooking throughout this area today. In Peru, rich 
peanut butter-based sauces cover aji de gallina (a peppery chicken dish), papas 
arequipena (potatoes in peanut sauce) and carapulcra (ditto, with Andean 
freeze-dried potatoes). In Ecuador, cheesy fried potato patties ( llapingachos 
) come in spicy peanut sauce. Bolivian cooks make a chicken soup with peanut 
dumplings, sopa de mani.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so on. The Brazilian dish peixe com molho de amendoim is fish simmered 
with peanut butter, spices and chiles. Mexico puts ground peanuts into certain 
moles and in stews with names like pollo encacahuetado. In the Caribbean, they 
stew rabbits with peanut sauce. To say nothing about the many Latin American 
sweets made with peanuts, or the Caribbean peanut milk cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
 Europeans first came across the peanut in Haiti, where the Taino people called 
it mani (the Portuguese word amendoim comes from a related Brazilian language). 
Mani became the word for peanut in Colonial Spanish, and that's why Bolivians 
call it by a name imported from Haiti, even when they're descended from the 
people who domesticated the plant in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 16th Century the Spanish took the peanut to the Philippines, where 
it is still called mani. In most of eastern Asia, however, it was the Chinese 
who spread it. The peanut is known as "Chinese bean" in Japan and Indonesia, 
and as far away as India, to the Bengalis it's chinabadam , "Chinese almond." 
</P>
<P>
 The peanut was a big hit in Asia (today 85% of the world's peanuts are grown 
in Asia and Africa), but in large chunks of that continent the peanut rarely, 
if ever, winds up as peanut butter. The Chinese boil peanuts plain or toss them 
into stir-fries, but to China the peanut is primarily an oil seed. In fact, 
Chinese cookery is hard to imagine without the flavor of frying peanut oil, 
which is why China is the largest peanut grower in the world today. But Chinese 
peanut butter? Not that you'd notice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 India also raises peanuts primarily for oil, though the southern part of the 
country has more interest in them for their own sake. Whole or chopped peanuts 
show up in pilafs, salads and tamarind-based sauces in South India. Ground 
peanuts do play a role in Indian snack foods, though. 
</P>
<P>
 For anything like a peanut butter cuisine, you have to stop halfway between 
India and China, in Indonesia. One of the most famous Indonesian dishes is 
satay, little skewers of grilled meat served with mildly spicy sweet-sour 
sauces made with peanut butter, chiles, coconut milk and fish sauce. Satay has 
spread around Southeast Asia as far as Sri Lanka, off the southern tip of 
India. In Indonesia there's even a salad ( gado-gado ) with a rich satay-style 
peanut sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 Southern Thailand has peanut butter dishes of its own, such as pra ram long 
song (beef and spinach stewed in something rather like a satay sauce) and gai 
thua (chicken in a peanut butter and coconut milk curry). But the farther you 
get from Indonesia, the smaller the role peanuts play. In places like Cambodia 
and Burma, they go back to the same sort of role they play in China, getting 
chopped up and tossed into soup or salad. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Africa that the peanut found its heartiest welcome. The Portuguese 
brought it to West Africa in the early 1500s, and in 1564 the traveler Alvares 
de Almada reported it was already an established crop in Senegal and Gambia 
(which are still among the world's greatest peanut-exporting countries). Within 
200 years it had spread on its own all the way across Africa to Angola, without 
Portuguese help.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This was an amazing speed in the pre-modern age, particularly in Africa, where 
long-distance travel was difficult. The reason the peanut spread so fast was 
that the idea of a nut/bean growing underground was not unfamiliar in Africa. 
There were already a couple of indigenous African "groundnuts." 
</P>
<P>
 The most important was Voandzeia subterranea, an underground cousin of the 
cowpea that is one of the tiny handful of food plants the Central African rain 
forest and savannah have contributed to the human diet. It was one of the five 
crops the Bantus had with them 3,000 years ago when they began the expansion 
that eventually made half of sub-Saharan Africa Bantu-speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Peanuts and Voandzeia are much alike. They're both foot-high shrubs (peanut 
leaves comes in fours, though, while Voandzeia leaves come in threes) and they 
both ripen their "nuts" in underground pods. But Voandzeia has only one largish 
seed to a pod, and while a peanut is 40%-50% oil, Voandzeia is only 8% oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Some African nationalities seem to have retained a taste for a less oily 
groundnut. The Hausas of northern Nigeria often cook with peanut cake, the 
residue that remains in the press after the oil is squeezed out of peanuts. The 
14th Century Arab traveler Ibn Battuta reported being served a snack of fried 
Voandzeia paste. The present-day Hausa snack kuli kuli is much the same thing, 
only these days it's made from peanuts with as much of the oil removed as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the peanut apparently spread so widely in Africa because it was able 
to move into an existing culinary niche, as shown by the fact that throughout 
Africa it has taken over the local names that had formerly been used for 
Voandzeia. The Hausas, for instance, still often use the same name ( gujiya ) 
for peanut and Voandzeia. To the Kikongo of Zaire, peanuts are nguba and 
Voandzeia is nguba zi Kongo , "the groundnut of the Congo." Voandzeia, being 
less oily, is harder than the peanut, so in a number of languages it's called 
"hard groundnut." That's what the Swahili word njugumaye means; the peanut, 
which the Swahilis got from Malawi (the former Nyasaland), is njugunyasa . 
</P>
<P>
 From Senegal in West Africa to Tanzania and Mozambique in East Africa, peanuts 
are added to stews with meat, onions, tomatoes and chiles. In West Africa, it's 
particularly characteristic to add dried shrimp or fish. (In Cameroon, though, 
peanut sauce is served on fresh shrimp.) In East Africa, vegetables are often 
stewed with peanut butter -- spinach or squash in Kenya, cornmeal or beans in 
Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
 In southern Nigeria, the Ijaw people smoke some of their peanuts, drying them 
on racks over a smoking fire. In northern Nigeria, the Hausas stew meat with 
chiles and onions in the usual way, and they also coat skewered meat ( tsire ) 
with peanut cake and ginger, more or less making satay with the sauce cooked 
right on. They make a sort of jerky ( kilishi ) by coating meat with peanut 
cake and spices and drying it in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 It's well known that peanuts accompanied African slaves to the New World; the 
old American name goober clearly comes from one of the Congolese languages that 
use the word nguba. So it shouldn't be surprising that the African habit of 
stewing meat with peanut butter, tomatoes, onions and chiles found its way to 
the Caribbean.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what a pity -- there were some places the peanut just couldn't spread. 
Cool climates, for instance, because the peanut needs warmth. It also needs a 
fair amount of water during its summer growing season, which effectively rules 
it out for most of the Mediterranean. In the Arab world, peanuts are known only 
as a sidewalk snack -- peanut-growing entrepreneurs from the Sudan roast them 
on street corners, the same way chestnuts are roasted in this country. As a 
result, the Arabs call peanuts Sudan beans, or Sudan pistachios. 
</P>
<P>
 But what would have happened if the Near East had been a suitable environment 
for growing peanuts? Would peanut butter have replaced sesame tahineh? Would we 
be eating hummus made with peanut butter? 
</P>
<P>
 We'll never know. It might have been the greatest thing since satay.

 The word "nyeleng" comes from the Mandinka language of West Africa, but the 
Mandinkas' peanut-farming neighbors, the Wolof people of Senegal, now make this 
dish as well. Jamaica (pronounced hah-MY-kah) is the Spanish name for the dried 
blossoms of an African shrub, Hibiscus sabdariffa. It is sold in Latin markets 
and many supermarkets under the name of jamaica, but you can also find it in 
Caribbean markets (as sorrel) and Near Eastern import stores (as karkadeh). 
Though it's best known in this country as an herbal tea -- it's what makes teas 
such as Red Zinger tart and red -- in Africa this hibiscus is often used in 
cooking. For that matter, okra is also an African hibiscus. BEEF AND PEANUT

 Llapingachos are fried Ecuadorean potato patties flavored with cheese. In this 
case, there's a sweet leavening of cilantro as well. The traditional peanut 
sauce that goes with them tastes so much like a Southeast Asian sauce (just add 
a little coconut milk and fish sauce and you'd be there) that the dish becomes 
something like an extremely rich vegetarian satay. From "South American 
Cooking" by Barbara Karoff.

 On paper, this Caribbean recipe looks like one of the usual West African 
peanut butter-flavored stews, except that it contains no tomatoes or greens. 
Amazingly, however, the effect is quite French, as if somebody had substituted 
peanut butter for the mushrooms in a cream-enriched sauce champignon (and added 
a dose of hot pepper). In "The Complete Book of Caribbean Cooking," Elisabeth 
Lambert Ortiz credits the recipe to the former British Leeward Islands -- now 
the independent nations of St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda -- but we note 
that they're pretty close to Guadeloupe, which is so French it actually votes 
in the French parliament. CARIBBEAN RABBIT AND GROUNDNUT STEW 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces salt pork, cubed 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 pounds rabbit, cleaned and cut into serving pieces

<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>

 This very rich Mexican candy is something like a giant peanut butter cup made 
with dark chocolate and slightly grainy, freshly ground peanuts. As the name 
indicates, it is a Mexican adaptation of marzipan, substituting peanuts for 
ground almonds. CHOCOLATE-COVERED PEANUT PATTIES (Mazapan) 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups unsalted roasted peanuts 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sugar

paste. Divide into 12 equal pieces. In 2 1/2-inch-diameter ramekin, mold each 
piece into thick disk. Remove disks from mold carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt chocolate in double boiler and keep warm. Spoon 1 generous tablespoon 
melted chocolate onto wax paper. Carefully place 1 peanut disk on top and move

 It's true, as George Washington Carver emphasized, that pound for pound 
peanuts contain more vitamins, proteins and minerals than beef liver. However, 
They also contain more fat. The average eating peanut is about 40% oil.

 It was 2 a.m. at the Ralphs on Laurel Canyon and Pamela Holdridge was leaning 
into the freezer, frantically poking through the Haagen Daz in search of a pint 
of deep chocolate with peanut butter. When she couldn't find it, the 
30-year-old Studio City resident ended up buying chocolate ice cream and a jar 
of peanut butter and mixing it up herself. "It wasn't the same," she says, "but 
I was desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Holdridge just can't get enough peanut butter. She layers it on slices of 
green apples, dips bananas into it, slathers it on rice cakes and mixes it with 
sesame oil, chile, green onions and garlic to make a sauce for pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't much of a peanut butter lover until I turned 16 and went to boarding 
school," she says. "All of a sudden something clicked and I developed this 
incredible obsession." 
</P>
<P>
 She's not the only one. About 40 million Americans eat peanut butter on any 
given day. That's about 800 million pounds of peanut butter a year -- enough 
peanut butter to cover the floor of the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who would go to the trouble to figure out such a statistic? The Adult Peanut 
Butter Lovers Fan Club, of course. In seven years, the club for fans of the 
goober spread has grown to 60,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started the club," says director Mitch Head, "peanut butter was the 
Rodney Dangerfield of food. It got no respect among foodies." 
</P>
<P>
 But America's sticky secret is that there's a jar of peanut butter in 85% of 
the homes in the U.S. Famous honorary peanut butter fan club members include 
President Clinton, Jack Nicholson, Tom Selleck, Shirley MacLaine, Dan Rather, 
Madonna and gold medal speed skater Bonnie Blair. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Bonnie Blair) eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before each race," 
says Head. "She uses Skippy Super Chunk." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the fan club newsletter "Spread The News!" the best-selling brand 
of peanut butter is Jif, followed by Skippy and then Peter Pan. Yet there is 
little difference between products. FDA standards say peanut butter must be 90% 
peanuts and can't have artificial sweeteners or color. "It's the type of 
sweetener used that makes the difference," explains Head. "Jiffy uses molasses, 
Skippy uses a corn sweetener and Peter Pan uses sugar." 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, according to Holdridge, there will be a shop that sells only things 
made with peanut butter. Peanut butter cookies, peanut butter bars, peanut 
butter pie, peanut butter sandwiches . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything peanut butter for peanut butter lovers," she says. "It could be 
called Peanut Butter Love Shop." 
</P>
<P>
 To join the Adult Peanut Butter Lovers Fan Club, send $3 with your name and 
address to: P.O. Box 7528, Tifton, Ga. 31793. Members receive a membership 
card, recipe booklet and a subscription to the quarterly fan club newsletter.

 The Peanut Advisory Board is persnickety about peanut butter, and its members 
don't want anyone fooling around with a good thing. When Peter Pan introduced 
Smart Choice peanut butter in January with 25% less fat than regular, the 
Atlanta-based group immediately filed a complaint with the Food and Drug 
Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with low-fat peanut butter? While the new product has the same 
number of calories as other peanut butters (95 calories per tablespoon), and 
the same amount of protein, vitamins and nutrients, it has only 12 grams of fat 
instead of 16. Peter Pan achieved the fat reduction by replacing peanuts with 
soy protein and sugar. According to FDA standards, peanut butter must contain 
90% peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not objecting to the fact that they are selling it," says Mitch Head, 
executive director of the Peanut Advisory Board, which represents Southeastern 
peanut farmers. "The problem is the labeling. Nowhere on the jar does it say it 
contains 25% less peanuts." The peanut farmers insist it should be called 
"peanut spread," with the exact peanut percentage listed on the label. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA normally requires a name change for products that don't conform to its 
standards. For instance, jam with less than 65% sugar must be called "fruit 
spread." "Low-fat" mayonnaise, made without eggs and oil, must be called "salad 
dressing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We see it as an equivalent to a diet drink," says Kay Carpenter, spokeswoman 
for Peter Pan. "You have Coke and Diet Coke. There's peanut butter and 
reduced-fat peanut butter. And this is represented on the label and we think 
it's very accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 While the FDA is still looking into the matter, Skippy has just come out with 
a reduced-fat peanut butter too. 
</P>
<P>
 Peanut butter sales have recently slipped 9%. Manufacturers believe this is 
because consumers are concerned about the fat content of peanut butter.  
</P>
<P>
 One could reason that the Southeastern peanut farmers -- who produce 80% of 
the peanuts that go into peanut butter -- would welcome any new product that 
would help increase sales. Not so.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern isn't whether we sell more," says Head. "It's just not right for 
someone to be tampering with a recipe that's 100 years old. We care about the 
integrity of peanut butter."

OUR DAILY SPREAD ; E PLURIBUS CHUNKY; AMERICAN HISTORY: THE SPREAD MADE FROM 
"GOOBER PEAS" WAS NO OVERNIGHT SENSATION. IT TOOK AN EX-SLAVE SCIENTIST AND 
INVENTOR TO DEVELOP PEANUT BUTTER'S POTENTIAL.

 The United States is the peanut-butter-eatingest nation in the world. In most 
countries, peanuts are basically a source of oil (it's estimated one-sixth of 
the world's vegetable oil comes from peanuts). In our country, though, only a 
small fraction of the peanut crop goes for oil. Most of the rest turns into 
good old smooth or crunchy. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always this way. Until late in the 19th Century, only the poorest 
people in the South ate peanuts, and they ate them boiled or fried, not spread 
on bread with jelly. Of course, some people consumed peanuts without realizing 
it -- in the form of Smithfield ham, which is made from hogs fattened on 
peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But a taste for peanuts grew, supposedly because soldiers on both sides of the 
Civil War had sometimes been reduced to eating "goober peas." In the 1880s, P. 
T. Barnum started selling roasted peanuts at his circuses, and for a long time 
peanuts were associated with seeing (and feeding) elephants. Roasted peanuts 
gradually became a familiar snack food. By the middle of the 1890s there were 
peanut-roasting wagons on city streets.  
</P>
<P>
 Peanut butter had been invented (as far as this country is concerned) in 1880 
by a St. Louis physician who wanted a high-protein food to prescribe for his 
patients. It was being made commercially by 1890, but it wasn't exactly an 
overnight sensation. In 1899 there were still only two companies making it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1896, when the ex-slave scientist/inventor George Washington Carver began 
exploring new uses for the peanut, it wasn't even a recognized commercial crop. 
One thing that got Carver interested in the peanut was its potential for 
reversing the soil depletion that had resulted from the over-planting of cotton 
in the South. Peanuts, which belong to the legume family, actually add nitrogen 
to the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Carver made the nation peanut-conscious, dazzling people with the hundreds of 
uses he found for "the humble goober." He created inks, plastics, linoleum, 
cosmetics -- altogether about 300 products. And he stressed the nutritional 
value of peanuts, especially their high protein content. In 1912, Good 
Housekeeping was publishing a few peanut recipes (peanut and rice pilaf, peanut 
sauce for turkey, a peanut omelet, peanut canapes). 
</P>
<P>
 A patent had been granted for a commercial peanut grinding machine in 1903. By 
1914, there were several dozen brands of peanut butter -- most of them, 
however, with only local distribution because peanut butter didn't keep well. 
The oil quickly separated out, and stirring it back in was a strenuous job. 
Peanut butter turned rancid pretty quick too. 
</P>
<P>
 Peanuts got an official boost from Washington during World War I, when the 
wartime Food Administration popularized the latest nutritional discoveries, 
such as protein and vitamins, as part of a program of encouraging people to 
conserve food. As the result of all the publicity from Carver and the Food 
Administration, Americans came to think of protein-rich peanut butter as a 
particularly suitable food for growing children.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So for generations, the grammar school cloakroom was a place lined with 
grease-stained paper bags wafting the mingled scents of peanut butter and tuna 
salad sandwiches. Peanut butter sandwiches acquired a nostalgic charm 
impossible for non-Americans to understand -- just as we find it impossible to 
understand the appeal of the Australian sandwich spread Vege-Mite, also 
originally a health food. 
</P>
<P>
 With the introduction of improved technology such as hydrogenation and 
stabilizers, the keeping qualities of peanut butter improved and national 
peanut brands started to emerge. In 1927, J. L. Rosenfield Packing Co. of 
Alameda, Calif., licensed its process for making smoother-textured peanut 
butter to E. K. Pond of Chicago, which made Peter Pan. In 1932, Rosenfield 
canceled the agreement and started marketing its own brand, Skippy. Skippy's 
chunky-style peanut butter was introduced in 1935. Peanut butter as we know it 
from the supermarket shelf had started to take shape. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in some other countries there are styles of peanut butter that 
haven't caught on here yet. In Haiti, there's a peanut butter flavored with hot 
pepper known as mamba. The Ijaw of Nigeria grind their smoked peanuts -- and 
mix them with smoked fish for a sort of canape. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Indonesia, peanut butter is fermented like tempeh , the Indonesian 
version of soybean tofu. Peanut butter tempeh is served fried, by the way.

IN THE KITCHEN; ORANGE BLOSSOM SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We who live in California tend to forget that citrus fruits are really a 
fairly exotic sub-tropical specialty. They grow so willy-nilly here that 
something as extravagantly perfumed as a navel orange is treated as if it were 
an onion. 
</P>
<P>
 But think about it for a minute. Is there anything that smells better than a 
citrus tree in bloom? In the full flower of late spring (earlier, it seems, 
this year), I'll sometimes bring a lemon branch or an orange branch into the 
kitchen and stick it in water as if it were an orchid. The next morning, the 
room is full of the opulent, heady smell of the flower. 
</P>
<P>
 That smell, so sweet it's nearly cloying yet at the same time clean and 
bracing, has changed by the time the flower has turned to fruit. Not that 
there's anything wrong with the smell of an orange, mind you, but somehow the 
extra dimension of spiciness has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 That smell was on my mind last weekend as I picked some oranges from the tree 
in my back yard. I wanted to make a dessert to follow a fairly weighty 
mid-winter meal. What I really wanted, to tell the truth, was a Dreamsicle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You may remember them from childhood runs to the Good Humor truck. The 
Dreamsicle was an orange Popsicle that always seemed to have an aura of 
sophistication missing in more plebeian fare -- the Fudgesicle, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 That extra element was vanilla, and just a little bit of it lifted the 
Dreamsicle from Popsicle-dom to something approaching elegance (or, at least as 
much elegance as kids on bikes would accept). When you get right down to it, a 
Dreamsicle smells closer to an orange flower than almost anything else I can 
think of. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was, there was only one real orange-vanilla dessert I could ever 
remember eating. That was at some small-town continental restaurant where the 
maitre d' -- a tuxedoed older gentleman who said he had spent 20 years waiting 
tables in some of the finest establishments in Las Vegas -- prepared his 
table-side specialty by whipping together a casino-elegant combination of 
nearly melted vanilla ice cream and orange sherbet. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't exactly what I had in mind. If I served something like that after 
a big dinner of baked beans, bratwursts and ale, I was afraid we'd have to soap 
the guests down before we could squeeze them out the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What I wanted was something lighter but with the same intensity of flavor. So 
I decided to try and poach the oranges in a vanilla-scented syrup. It took a 
couple of tries to get it just right. Hint: Do not try to actually poach peeled 
oranges. Pour boiling syrup over oranges and let them steep, that's all the 
cooking they need. And lay off the orange flower water. Though it seems logical 
that orange flower water would smell like orange flowers, to my nose it more 
resembles orange cough syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, you must use vanilla beans to get the full effect. I made the dish once 
with vanilla extract and, while that may be fine for baking, it just doesn't 
deliver the flowery smell of the bean. Sure the beans are a little expensive, 
but we live in Southern California, so oranges are cheap, right? 
</P>
<P>
 So here's the question: Did I love Dreamsicles because they smelled like 
orange blossoms, or do I love orange blossoms because they smell like 
Dreamsicles? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The basic idea of this recipe -- oranges gently poached in a fairly heavy 
syrup -- can be turned many different ways. If you like, try some cinnamon or 
cloves. I've even seen it done with rosemary, though I am so sick of rosemary 
these days that in my garden it's practically an ornamental rather than a 
culinary herb.  
</P>
<P>
 DREAMSICLE ORANGES 
</P>
<P>
 6 navel oranges 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 
</P>
<P>
 With thin, sharp knife, trim tops and bottoms of oranges so that flesh shows. 
Place orange flat on cutting board. Start with knife at point where white of 
peel meets orange flesh and, following curve of orange and using gentle sawing 
motion, slice 1 1/2- to 2-inch wide strip of peel from orange, cutting away 
both white and peel but leaving as much flesh as possible. Repeat until all 
peel is removed, preferably 5 to 6 slices. Repeat with remaining oranges, 
reserving peel of 2 oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine water and sugar in saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to boil 
and cook 5 minutes. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into pan and then add bean 
halves. Add reserved peels from 2 oranges. Boil 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from 
heat. Steep 30 to 60 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 While syrup is cooking, carefully slice oranges horizontally into 1/2-inch 
slices. There should be about 4 slices per orange. Carefully remove seeds from 
center sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Layer orange slices in large, flat serving bowl. Pour syrup through strainer 
over slices. Arrange vanilla bean strips in X on top. Cover tightly with 
plastic wrap. Chill at least 1 hour. Makes 6 servings.

 Elvis Presley loved peanut butter -- he spread it on bread, added some bananas 
and then fried the whole thing in butter. Jack Nicholson eats peanut butter in 
bed to keep up his strength.Tom Selleck is also a peanut-butter fanatic; so is 
William F. Buckley Jr.  
</P>
<P>
 If you're nuts about peanut butter too, there's none better than that made at 
this pint-sized Peanut Shop that's been doing business the same careful way for 
24 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Easy to spread and with a taste of fresh-roasted peanuts, there's no secret 
ingredient here. It is just super-fresh meaty peanuts and perhaps a little 
salt.  
</P>
<P>
 The peanut butter costs $13.95 for three 18-ounce jars ($1 extra for orders 
west of the Mississippi) and is available in three varieties: smooth-lightly 
salted, smooth salt-free, and chunky-lightly salted. It's peanut butter for 
particular people. KATHIE JENKINS

HOME COOK: BACK TO BREAKFAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Breakfast is the best meal of the day; it is like a friend one meets each 
morning -- comforting, familiar, sustaining. Made of honest, simple 
ingredients, it is the barometer for the day. As 19th-Century British essayist 
Leigh Hunt once wrote: "Breakfast is a forecast of the whole day; spoil that 
and all is spoiled." 
</P>
<P>
 After the publication of "The Breakfast Book," which I wrote to celebrate the 
day's most neglected meal, I received a fan letter from an Englishman who 
summed up my feelings on the matter: "My favorite American food is breakfast 
(not in the loathsome dry-cereal sense). But it is getting harder and harder to 
find in this country. Hotels and innumerable restaurants now serve brunch and 
dish up mainly super-chic dollops of quail liver with pineapple sauce, chicken 
breast with bacon and peacock tongue gravy and similar folderols, and you're 
lucky to find one rubbery omelet on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for the corner lunch counters, which used to be best, the neighborhood 
salvation, they have all but disappeared. There are no pancakes worth the name, 
no hash, no country sausage, no scrapple, nothing. Dollar pancakes have 
practically vanished." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the saddest losses of all is that there is an entire generation of 
young Americans who don't know the true language of breakfast with homemade 
dishes. They define the meal as a snack of pop-ups and candy-like cold cereal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many people also think of breakfast as brunch, but the two are totally 
different meals. Brunch has no defined ingredients and preparations -- it can 
be any type of meal. It's almost always a party-like affair, served with wine 
and liquor and with an assortment of unrelated dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast, of course, involves no alcohol and usually consists of grains, 
dairy products, fruits and maybe eggs or a little meat or fish. Breakfast has 
remained pure amid all the food trends with their stylish dishes and fancy 
ingredients. The honest simplicity of breakfast is still captivating. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of today's attention to health and what we should and shouldn't eat, 
salt or no salt, sugar or no sugar, we tend to overlook one of the healthiest 
parts of eating: Getting a good start with breakfast, which makes it the most 
important meal of the day. Lunch may be only a token meal, and dinner or supper 
a modest one, but before expending energy for the day, food is essential, and 
it should be made with good, wholesome ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 The following recipes give some easy answers to breakfast: The ham and farm 
cheese butter-fried sandwiches are nourishing and appealing to children. The 
feather-bed eggs can be made ready to bake the night before needed. The prune 
and walnut loaf can be made long before needed and then sliced, frozen and 
toasted when desired.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And last, the most delicious waffle in the whole world, raised waffles. This 
recipe comes from an early Fannie Farmer cookbook. The waffle is very crisp on 
the outside and delicate on the inside. HAM AND FARM CHEESE BUTTER-FRIED 
SANDWICHES 
</P>
<P>
 4 slices fresh whole-wheat bread 
</P>
<P>
 About 3 ounces soft cream cheese  
</P>
<P>
 4 thin slices ham 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
 Lay 4 slices of bread on surface and spread each slice on 1 side with rounded 
tablespoon of cream cheese. Place 2 ham slices on top of 2 of slices and cover 
with remaining slices of bread. Melt butter over medium-low heat. Place 
sandwiches in pan and fry gently until bottom is golden, pressing down on each 
sandwich occasionally with spatula, this helps to melt cheese. Turn and fry 
other side. Serve warm. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>

foil-wrapped.

GOOD COOKING: SHANKS FOR THE BRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Braising is a long, slow cooking method that develops flavor and tenderizes 
meat by gently breaking down the fibers. The meat is browned first, then cooked 
in a tightly covered just-deep-enough baking dish or casserole with vegetables 
and enough liquid to moisten the meat but not cover it completely. Braised 
dishes are best made ahead, to allow their flavors to pull together into a 
mouthwatering whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Braised dishes smack of the best home cooking, dishes that are perfect for 
family dinners or informal suppers with friends. What's more, they are dishes 
rarely found in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's my answer to reader Judith Pollock's request, a braised lamb shank dish 
that is bound to satisfy not only in the way it looks but tastes. "Frenching" 
the long bone (and removing the knuckle) distinguishes its presentation; the 
lamb shank sits on its meaty base with the bone angled upward. A good butcher 
should be able to prepare the shanks to these specifications. If you can't get 
it done, it will taste fine anyway. Served with a side of gremolata fettuccine, 
it's difficult to resist. 
</P>
<P>
 If you like, serve this meal with a green salad mixed with slivers of Kalamata 
olives. Dessert should be simple, too; the lemon cookies pair with fruit 
gelatos or fresh fruit desserts.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This recipe can be doubled or tripled, but the shanks should be arranged 
single layer in a close-fitting casserole for the most successful results. Try 
to cook the dish ahead so the flavors have a chance to mellow and meld 
together. Also, any solidified fat is easy to remove.  
</P>
<P>
 BRAISED LAMB SHANKS 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 lamb shanks, about 1 pound each, trimmed of visible fat, knuckle removed 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 4 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 rib celery, strings removed, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium carrots, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium red onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup dry red wine 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups reduced sodium chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 Scant 1/4 cup tomato paste 
</P>
<P>
 2 large plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, diced 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 teaspoons dried rosemary 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 teaspoons thyme leaves 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. 
Rinse shanks and dry well with paper towels. Season shanks to taste with salt 
and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 When oil is hot, sear shanks until well browned all over. Transfer to 
casserole or baking dish big enough to hold shanks in single layer.  
</P>
<P>
 Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to same skillet. When hot, add garlic, celery, 
carrots and onion. Cook over medium-high heat until fragrant and onion is 
somewhat tender, about 4 minutes, stirring often. Add red wine, chicken broth, 
tomato paste, tomatoes, rosemary and thyme. Bring to boil. Ladle over lamb

 Gremolata, an Italian garnish of minced parsley, garlic and lemon zest, is 
typically sprinkled over osso bucco to give a fresh lift to the braised veal 
shanks. Here, mixed with orange zest as well, it does the same thing for the 
lamb shanks, tossed right into the fettuccine.  
</P>
<P>

 The complementary flavors of lemon and clove give these cookies an especially 
lively flavor. Mince the lemon zest with the sugar in a food processor or 
blender to get the most flavor from the lemon oil. Pair these cookies with 
lemon or raspberry gelato or any fresh fruit dessert.  
</P>
<P>
 LEMONY CLOVE COOKIES 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Zest 2 large lemons, removed with zester or fine grater 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
 24 whole cloves, for garnish, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1 large egg 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 Sift flour with baking powder, ground cloves and 1/4 teaspoon salt onto sheet 
of wax paper.  
</P>
<P>
 Use food processor or blender to mince lemon zest with sugar until zest 
becomes small specks.  
</P>
<P>
 To make dough with food processor, process butter, lemon-sugar and egg until 
completely smooth, about 1 minute, stopping once to scrape down sides. Add 
flour mixture and process until just combined. Do not overprocess. 
</P>
<P>
 To make dough with electric mixer, cream butter and lemon-sugar until fluffy. 
Add egg and mix until smooth. Add flour mixture and combine.  
</P>
<P>
 Wrap dough airtight and chill until firm, about 4 hours or overnight. (If 
necessary, dough can be firmed in freezer in 20 minutes).  
</P>
<P>
 With hands, roll tablespoons of dough into balls and place on greased baking 
sheets 1 1/2 inches apart. Press lightly with fingers to flatten. Press 1 whole 
clove lightly in center of each cookie. 
</P>
<P>
 For glaze, use fork to froth egg with dash salt in small bowl. Lightly brush 
over cookies with feather brush. (Remaining glaze can be refrigerated up to 3 
days and used for breads and other cookies.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bake on middle rack oven at 350 degrees until lightly browned, about 10 to 12 
minutes. Let stand 3 minutes on baking sheet. Use metal spatula to transfer to 
rack to cool.  
</P>
<P>
 When completely cool, store in airtight tin at room temperature up to 1 week 
or freeze up to 1 month. Makes 24 (2-inch-diameter) cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Each cookie contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 86 calories; 58 mg sodium; 28 mg cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 11 grams 
carbohydrates; 1 gram protein; 0.02 gram fiber. Processor Power

<P>
 Not all recipes are created equal, and not all recipes benefit from 
preparation in the food processor. The following tips lessen the preparation 
time in making the braised lamb shanks, gremolata fettuccine and lemon clove 
cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 * To finely mince garlic, be sure work bowl is dry and free of moisture. Turn 
on processor fitted with metal blade. Drop cloves through feed tube and let 
processor run until mincing stops. Any number of garlic cloves -- from one to 
20 -- can be minced together in this way. 
</P>
<P>
 * To chop vegetables such as carrots, onions and celery for braised dishes or 
soups, cut vegetables into one-inch chunks. Put vegetables, in one-cup batches, 
in processor fitted with metal blade. Use on/off motion to control texture of 
chopped vegetables. Transfer vegetables to pot or onto piece of wax paper. 
</P>
<P>
 * To make gremolata -- a minced mixture of parsley, garlic, orange and lemon 
zests -- put clumps of parsley leaves (absolutely dry, without any moisture 
clinging to them) into dry work bowl along with orange and lemon zests (colored 
outer skin). Turn on processor fitted with metal blade. Drop garlic cloves 
through feed tube and process until mincing stops. 
</P>
<P>
 * To make lemon cookies, first process sugar and lemon zest together until the 
zest is minced as fine as the sugar and the aromatic lemon oil is released. Add 
softened butter and egg. Process until smoothly mixed. Add dry ingredients. Use 
on/off motion to combine dough, stopping just when last bit of flour 
disappears, to avoid toughening up the dough.

LIKE GREEN ON RICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cooks in Mediterranean countries often prepare greens and rice in one pot for 
a quick, easy and satisfying dish. The technique starts out like rice pilaf, 
with sauteed onion and sometimes garlic. Shredded greens are then cooked 
briefly with the onion. Next, the rice, broth or water and seasonings are 
added, and everything finishes cooking together in about 20 minutes. You can 
cook any tender greens this way; the best are spinach, Swiss chard, beet greens 
and green cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
 This method works because the greens cook quickly naturally. The water that is 
added to cook the rice creates enough steam to soften the greens. During the 
cooking, the rice absorbs flavor and aroma from the greens, which also 
contribute a moist, tender texture that complements the slightly chewy rice. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the dish even quicker, you can take advantage of packaged rinsed 
spinach, so there are no leaves to wash.  
</P>
<P>
 When the rice is cooked, sprinkle toasted almonds or pine nuts over the top. 
Fresh or sun-dried tomatoes or roasted sweet red peppers work well too. The 
greens and rice make a good accompaniment for roasted or grilled lamb, chicken 
or beef, but the dish also serves as a delightful vegetarian main course. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This dish is popular in Lebanese and Armenian cuisines. It is most colorful 
when you use beet greens because of the combination of white rice, green leaves 
and reddish stems.  
</P>
<P>
 EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN GREENS WITH RICE 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 to 1 pound beet greens or Swiss chard or spinach 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 large garlic cloves, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup long-grain white rice 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups boiling water 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons slivered almonds, toasted 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse greens thoroughly. Cut stems into 1/2-inch pieces. Chop leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in heavy skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saute 5 minutes, 
stirring often. Add beet stems and saute 2 minutes. Add leaves. Cover and cook 
over low heat, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes or until very tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Add garlic and rice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Combine well. Add 
water. Cover and cook over low heat, without stirring, until rice is tender, 
about 18 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve sprinkled with toasted 
almonds. Makes 2 to 3 main-course or 4 side-dish servings.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: BIG SPLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behold the major Cantonese restaurant, home to a thousand wedding feasts, 
gleaming centerpiece of what seems like half the new developments in Chinatown 
or the San Gabriel Valley. They're big, these places, long as a soccer field 
and nearly as wide, typically dominated by wall-size fish tanks, encrusted with 
marble, home to massively crowded dim sum breakfasts and extravagant seafood 
dinners. The Chinese restaurants I'm normally drawn to tend to be smaller, more 
intimate than the Cantonese behemoths, which seem sometimes to be more about 
opulence than food.  
</P>
<P>
 Big Cantonese places may serve pan-fried scallops and steamed fish to small 
parties, but they really exist to cater banquet feasts of expensive ingredients 
-- sea cucumber, abalone, birds' nest, sharks' fin -- for business dinners and 
grand family functions. And while the cooking may occasionally be superb 
(competition is brutal: no Chinese restaurant has ever done well without a good 
kitchen staff), it is also sometimes beside the point, as at the French 
restaurants that sate you with standard-issue foie gras and truffles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many of these Cantonese restaurants that they have come to seem 
almost routine, though almost any of them might be considered the single best 
Chinese place in almost any city outside California. And almost the moment one 
of them makes some innovation, such as grill carts for dim sum or special thick 
sauces based on sweet mayonnaise, it is copied by all the rest. A well-run 
Cantonese seafood palace has considerable pleasures of its own: dim sum, decent 
barbecue and impeccably fresh fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaworld is a shiny Cantonese seafood restaurant in Rosemead, a sleepy suburb 
that seems to be the latest San Gabriel Valley town to roll over from doughnut 
shops and trailer parks to Chinese shopping centers. Sort of a stadium-size 
exemplar of high-tech Art Deco futurism, like something out of a Robocop world 
with ziggurats and chandeliers and fish tanks, Seaworld is neither the best nor 
the worst Cantonese seafood restaurant in town. Actually, I'm kind of fond of 
the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend mornings, people surge through the door for dim sum  
</P>
<P>
 breakfasts, more or less the usual parade of rolling steam tables, hampers 
full of rice porridge, trays of glistening baked pork buns, segmented carts 
that conceal chile-spiked stews of tripe and various tubes. Here are fried 
crullers wrapped in slippery rice noodles; rich constructs of whitefish braised 
with Virginia ham; platters of roast duck; half-globes of sticky rice flavored 
with sweet Chinese sausage; fat, pale dumplings stuffed with an intensely green 
mince of vegetables, with shrimp and pork forcemeats, with fresh scallops. 
</P>
<P>
 Griddle carts circulate the room, preceded by wafts of their sweetly fragrant 
smoke, ready to grill to order rich squares of taro; fishcake-stuffed bell 
peppers; chewy rice noodles spiked with scallions and dried shrimp. From a cart 
puffing steam comes freshly boiled Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce and 
sliced geoduck clam with a peppery dip. From one glassed-in cart come baroquely 
decorated Chinese Jell-O desserts; from another comes rather flabby barbecued 
duck and chicken, along with sesame-scented jellyfish salad and pale slices of 
pork. It's good. It's cheap. It may not be quite at the level of Empress 
Pavilion or Harbor Village, but the lines are a little shorter, and the waiters 
seem nicer to kids. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner, Seaworld gears up for the banquet crowd, which comes because the 
place is new, but also for specialties such as superbly crisp Hong Kong fried 
chicken, lacquer-skinned and accompanied by a small dish of pepper-salt as a 
dip; for braised ducks' feet served with crunchy, pungent mustard greens; for 
simply steamed geoduck. 
</P>
<P>
 The rage in high-end Cantonese places these days is for a mixture of seafood 
with Western sweets, and one of the best -- and most unusual -- of Seaworld's 
dishes involves shrimp garnished with Twinkie-shaped crullers of deep-fried 
sweet custard, which works better than you'd think it might. Another dish of 
crunchy fried shrimp tossed in something like hot Miracle Whip and garnished 
with candied walnuts is pretty good if you ignore the fact that the combination 
tastes pretty weird. 
</P>
<P>
 There are decent whole shrimp "baked" in spicy salt; perfectly nice live rock 
cod steamed with ginger and scallions; live steamed shrimp -- and disappointing 
pan-fried scallops, jellyfish and chicken steamed with ham. Still, all in all, 
Seaworld is a reliable place, especially if there's hot peanut soup for 
dessert.

 Like a traveling carnival act, an old Asian man works his magic, entrancing a 
crowd of children outside the T & T Market in Diamond Square. He rolls a small 
mound of sweet, taffy-like dough between his palms and then, mimicking the 
technique of a Chinese noodle maker, flicks and twists the dough, snapping it 
into a thousand filaments of lion's mane candy.  
</P>
<P>
 His "act" isn't the only attraction at Diamond Square this Saturday afternoon. 
Next to T & T, in the mall's food court, an electronic band warms up, competing 
with a chattering battalion of video games in the amusement arcade. People are 
busily getting film developed, buying children's clothes, shopping for jewelry 
or checking out karaoke video cassettes. But mostly they are shopping for food 
or eating in the square's polyglot assortment of Asian restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 As the stylized neon logos above the food court's shops affirm, Diamond Square 
is San Gabriel Valley's new pan-Asian outpost. Signs advertise Pho Diamond, a 
Vietnamese noodle soup shop; Dennies Canteen, with a menu of northern Chinese 
breakfast items; and Fortune House, selling Taiwanese-style dried meats and 
snacks. My favorite place, Yee Shun Deli of Macao, makes delicious 
Chinese-style steamed milk desserts and Indonesian sate.

 Inquiring epicures will want to investigate Ledo, a Hong Kong-style coffee 
shop. Its "international" menu is typical of such places -- French toast and 
five-flavor beef stew lo mein are listed on the same page, and a section 
entitled Fountain Beverages suggests a Hawaiian sundae and longan ice. Next 
door to Ledo is a Japanese shabu shabu restaurant. And across the parking lot 
are a Vietnamese place, a Shanghainese restaurant and Diamond Seafood, which 
serves dim sum from carts and fish from Cantonese-style live tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The mixed Asian population in Diamond Square's neighborhood, which not so long 
ago was primarily Anglo and Latino, burgeoned incredibly between the 1980 and 
1990 censuses. The number of Asian residents in El Monte was up a stunning 
456%, in Rosemead and San Gabriel about 370%, while most other groups declined. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Just slightly east of the well-established Chinese enclave in Monterey Park, 
this neighborhood's new Asian pluralism becomes instantly clear as you peruse 
the merchandise in the coolers and on the shelves at T & T Market. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sauce department are jars and bottles of Filipino banana ketchup, 
Indonesian sambal oelek , Vietnamese tuong ot toi and Malay-style Maggi chili 
sauce -- packed by Nestle's in Kuala Lumpur. There is Pantainorasingh-brand 
saus prik , the garlicky, hot-sweet dipping sauce for Thai barbecued chicken, 
and Indonesian instant rendang mix for making a special beef curry. The fish 
sauces and fish pastes used as seasonings also run the gamut from Thai nam pla 
and Vietnamese nuoc mam to Malaysian belachan , Kampuchean prahok and 
Indonesian terasi.  
</P>
<P>
 If the sauces and condiments at T & T are often suited to a specific cuisine, 
the basic fresh ingredients, such as lemon grass, plantains, taro and water 
spinach are common to the whole Southeast Asian region and parts of China -- 
which is why T & T can so easily cater to so many nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
 The store is equipped with all the modern-day supermarket amenities that Asian 
shoppers have come to expect. You can use your ATM card at the check-out stand, 
where cashiers wear smart green jackets or vests with the T & T logo. And 
you'll see the usual array of live fish and seafood in big, gurgling tanks. T & 
T is a little smaller than several other massive-sized Asian markets in the 
area, but it's clear that its managers know exactly who's doing the shopping. 
SHOPPING LIST 
</P>
<P>
 PRODUCE  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A huge mound of freshly picked herbs and lettuces is a wonderful fixture on 
the Southeast Asian table. People eat the leaves with finger foods or they toss 
a few into their soup. In Eastern Thailand and Kampuchea, where the food is 
similar, and also in Southern Thailand and neighboring Malaysia, all sorts of 
locally grown herbs comprise this mealtime fixture.  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Southeast Asians here had to make do with fresh coriander, 
basil and mint. But now, herbs unfamiliar to Americans are starting to appear 
in Asian markets. Two of the most popular are rau ram and ngo gai (to use their 
Vietnamese names). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Rau Ram: Known in English as polygonum, rau ram has a bold, spicy taste akin 
to a concentrated blend of Asian basil and mint. You can easily identify it by 
the slight pink tinge of its stems and its small, pointy, green leaves. Rau ram 
is sold in bunches with about half a dozen leaves on a stem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Ngo Gai: Sometimes called saw-tooth herb because its long slender leaves 
have serrated edges, ngo gai tastes like an intense version of cilantro, to 
which it is botanically related. Sold in bunches of single leaves on a plastic 
tray covered in shrink-wrap, ngo gai will wind up being served alongside the 
Vietnamese pho and Southeast Asian hot-and-sour fish soups. I've been told that 
Caribbean cooks use the herb and that it is also known as Puerto Rican 
coriander. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Shredded Green Papaya and Carrot: For the convenience-food-minded, T & T 
sells pre-shredded carrot and papaya in bulk. These are actually shredded, not 
grated; they come in long, thin, curly strands. Green papaya is the main 
ingredient in som tam , the spicy Thai salad dressed with a chile-lime juice 
dressing, sometimes seasoned with crushed small crabs. A similar Kampuchean 
salad has fermented fish condiment in its dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vietnam, the green papaya's most popular use is in goi du du , a salad 
topped with sliced or julienned dried beef (or water buffalo, if you're 
up-country). Many love to serve goi du du with puffy shrimp chips, which you 
can buy here ready to eat.  
</P>
<P>
 In Laos, tam som , a shredded carrot salad made with lots of garlic, chiles 
and (sometimes) pork stomach, is a fixture at meals served for social 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Mixed Vegetables for Hot-and-Sour Soup: Each country in Southeast Asia has 
its own version of hot-and-sour soup. In the Philippines it's sinigang , made 
tart with tamarind; in Thailand it's tom yam , with lemon grass and fragrant 
kaffir lime leaves. One Kampuchean version is samla michou banle ; the 
Vietnamese make canh chua ca and the Laotian kaeng som or kaeng tom yum.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Pomelo, Pummelo or Shaddock: The pomelo looks like an inflated grapefruit 
(no surprise -- grapefruit is descended from it) but has a marvelous sweet, 
slightly tart taste that lacks the bitterness of grapefruit. Its botanical name 
is Citrus maxima, befitting the largest fruit of the citrus family. The Dutch 
discovered the pomelo in the Malaya-Indonesia area (our word pomelo comes from 
the Dutch pompelmoes ), where it grows abundantly, as it does throughout the 
humid areas of Southeast Asia and China. In recent centuries it has made its 
way to tropical regions of the Americas and now grows even in California. 
</P>
<P>
 I've discovered it's easiest to peel a pomelo if you score the very thick skin 
lengthwise about six times and peel it off in segments. You then must remove 
the juicy meat from its inedible membrane, which easily zips open like a little 
package after you score the inner edge of each segment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Pea Shoots: These curly little tendrils and tender shoots are getting to be 
a staple in chic Chinese restaurants. They taste like new spring peas, and the 
plants are grown as creepers rather than upright vines. Pinching off the buds 
prevents fruiting and flowering, which sends the pea flavor into the young 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are scarce and expensive in China, pea shoots are likely to be a 
special-occasion food. Restaurants like to serve them with crab meat or fresh 
shrimp roe as a delicacy. But the shoots are delicious just plain, stir-fried 
with a minimum amount of oil and slashed with a few teaspoons of Chinese rice 
wine or dry Sherry, a pinch of sugar and a little salt. NOODLE PRODUCTS  
</P>
<P>
 * Banh Hoi: In their package, these "noodle cakes" look like a mound of 
extra-fine fresh rice vermicelli, but when you unwrap the package, you find the 
noodles stuck together into a little pancake that you can peel off the pile. 
The cakes look similar to Sri Lankan string hoppers.  
</P>
<P>
 Banh hoi often substitute for rice papers in a Vietnamese meal. You use them 
topped with a piece of lettuce and some fresh herbs to wrap around bites of 
barbecued meat, meat ball or grilled fish. A dipping sauce always goes with 
this.  
</P>
<P>
 T & T's manager, James Lee, suggests that the rice cakes are best served 
slightly warm. Heat them over steam or for just a few seconds in a microwave 
oven on the "defrost" setting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Banh Cuon: Almost as basic as bread in Vietnam, banh cuon are related to the 
stuffed Chinese rice noodle sheets that you get at a dim sum meal, but they are 
a much lighter and finer version. T & T stocks freshly made rice noodle sheets 
beside the many other kinds of fresh rice noodles near the produce section. You 
will see banh cuon sold unrolled in a flat package, where they are called banh 
pho uot.  
</P>
<P>
 The rice sheets have all sorts of uses: Eaten sprinkled with a few fried 
shallots they go by the name banh cuon thanh tri. These are accompanied by a 
fresh herb such as mint, cucumber slices and a dipping sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 One particularly popular way to eat banh cuon in Vietnam is with slices of the 
cold cuts cha lua , gio lua or cha chien on the side. Banh cuon may also be 
filled with ground pork and tree ears or crushed, dried shrimp. VIETNAMESE COLD 
CUTS  
</P>
<P>
 One thing that distinguishes Vietnam from most of Asia is its taste for 
European-style charcuterie such as pate, cold sausage, head cheese and ham, 
which it adapted from the French colonists. Cold cuts fill banh mi , the 
Hoagie-like sandwich made on a French roll and garnished with marinated 
vegetables and herbs. They're also popular for appetizers and as luncheon 
meats, eaten with fresh rice paper sheets ( banh cuon ). I've included 
instructions for banh mi so you can try Vietnamese cold cuts at home.  
</P>
<P>
 T & T offers cold cuts from several companies, including Tay Ho, which are 
manufactured in a USDA-inspected plant in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Gio Lua: Also known as cha lua (and usually labeled as pork meat loaf in 
English), this smooth, bologna-like sausage is seasoned very slightly with fish 
sauce. It is steamed wrapped in banana leaves, which lends a special flavor to 
the meat. Whether in sandwiches or as an appetizer, gio lua should always be 
very thinly sliced after its leafy covering is removed.  
</P>
<P>
 When serving gio lua with banh cuon (sold in the noodle section of the 
market), cut the meat slices into halves. These are then easy to eat with a 
morsel of banh cuon in a single bite. To go with these you need the basic 
Vietnamese dipping sauce, nuoc cham . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Cha Chien: Basically, cha chien is the same as gio lua , but instead of 
being formed into a sausage shape and steamed in a banana leaf, cha chien is 
shaped into a square patty and deep-fried. Like gio lua , the meat is offered 
in sandwiches and on an assorted cold-cut appetizer plate called seven-course 
appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
 One young Vietnamese says she's found a new way to eat cha chien: "Cut a 
half-inch piece, warm it in a microwave about 30 seconds and put it in a hot 
dog bun with a little barbecue sauce. It's delicious."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Cha Bi: Cha bi uses the basic meat mixture as for gio lua except that it is 
blended with a few fine slivers of seasoned and cooked pork skin. The 
Vietnamese love the skin's slightly resilient texture. While pork skin may 
sound less than appealing, it is barely detectable in this flavorful cold cut. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Doi Gio Heo: Made from pork hock that has been cured in a manner similar to 
ham, the sausage-like doi gio heo is wrapped in a thin, translucent covering of 
pork skin. When it's thinly sliced it has a beautiful pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Pate Gan: A liver pate like the old-fashioned, home-made country variety 
found in France, pate gan is usually eaten spread on French bread. It is also a 
popular, but optional, ingredient in the Vietnamese hoagie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Gio Thu: Quite simply, gio thu is head cheese, almost identical to a 
European head cheese. It is made the classical way from pork snout and ears 
formed in a square mold. Thinly sliced, gio thu is light and refreshing on a 
French roll garnished with Vietnamese marinated vegetables. MISCELLANEOUS 
</P>
<P>
 * Vietnamese Meatball Mix: In addition to cold cuts, Tay Ho makes a 
well-seasoned, garlic-laced Southeast Asian-style meatball mixture. It's 
labeled with the Vietnamese name nem nuong , but it's popular with Laotians and 
Kampucheans too. The mixture is formed into one-inch balls, threaded onto a 
skewer several at a time and cooked over charcoal.  
</P>
<P>
 A popular accompaniment for the meatballs is banh hoi , the rice noodle cake 
described above. But rice paper or even plain rice do nicely too. As with all 
grilled dishes, the herb and lettuce tray and nuoc cham dipping sauce are 
standard. To eat nem nuong , wrap a meatball in a piece of rice paper or noodle 
cake topped with lettuce and herbs and dip in the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Flours and Flour Product Mixes: T & T carries all those exotic flours such 
as sweet potato starch, tapioca flour, taro starch and wheat starch (not flour) 
that are seldom seen in Western cooking. Besides these are prepared mixes -- 
the Asian equivalent of biscuit or blueberry muffin mix -- used for Asian 
specialty dishes. Most are manufactured here in California and packed in heavy 
plastic bags. Nowadays the English instructions are better than they used to be 
(although the syntax could still use some work). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Banh Xeo Mix: Banh xeo mix comes with a pouch of turmeric, which you add 
along with water and coconut milk. The resulting banh xeo , made primarily of 
rice starch, is an egg-yellow pancake that looks exactly like a folded omelet. 
</P>
<P>
 The filling for these cakes is made of ground pork and vegetables. Directions 
may be found in "The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam" by Bach Ngo and Gloria 
Zimmerman and in "The Simple Art of Vietnamese Cooking" by Binh Duong and 
Marsha Kiesel. A quickie filling is julienne of Chinese barbecue pork, a few 
cooked shrimp, and a few bean sprouts, sprinkled with garlic-seasoned fish 
sauce, minced scallion and fresh coriander leaves.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Shrimp Chips: These airy chips, made from tapioca starch and ground shrimp, 
show up as a delightful, crunchy garnish on all sorts of Southeast Asian 
dishes. Known as krupuk udang in Indonesia, they are served there with just 
about everything. In Vietnam, where they're called banh phong tom , they often 
accompany salads. The chips accompany drinks as an appetizer or can simply be a 
snack.  
</P>
<P>
 You can buy the Indonesian or Vietnamese variety uncooked. These need to be 
deep-fried about 12 seconds in two or more inches of 350-degree oil. 
</P>
<P>
 But T & T carries ready-to-eat shrimp chips made by Golden Pacific Foods in 
the City of Industry, and they've captured the American marketplace style. The 
chips come in several flavors: onion and garlic, sour cream and onion, and 
barbecue shrimp. Their snack food-style bags carry the suggestion: "Don't be a 
litter bug; keep America beautiful."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Banh Mi, the Vietnamese French bread sandwiches, must always include a thin 
smear of mayonnaise, the cold cuts of your choice, a few sprigs of fresh 
coriander and a layer of these marinated vegetables. Some people like to add a 
few thin slices of jalapeno chile.  
</P>
<P>

TOMATO OF THE FUTURE DELAYED . . . AGAIN; BIOTECHNOLOGY: THE COMPANY SET TO 
MARKET THE NATION'S FIRST GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TOMATO IS FINDING THAT IT'S 
NOT EASY TO GET ITS CONTROVERSIAL PRODUCT INTO GROCERY STORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The debut of Flavr Savr, the genetically engineered tomato, suffered yet 
another setback recently when a public hearing on its safety was canceled 
without rescheduling by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by Calgene Inc., the Flavr Savr was originally supposed to reach 
supermarket produce counters more than a year ago, but its introduction has 
been repeatedly delayed as the FDA reviews the genetic alterations in the 
tomato that allow for vine ripening and extended shelf life. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA, which had planned to hold the two-day session this week, canceled the 
hearing because the agency was unable to assemble all the relevant scientific 
experts. An FDA spokesman said that the cancellation was a matter of scheduling 
and not a reflection on the status of the Flavr Savr. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are not so sure. They believe the climate for food biotechnology has 
changed in the aftermath of the controversy surrounding FDA's approval of 
recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone, or BGH, a genetically engineered drug 
administered to cows that increases milk production. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgene officials, for one, were surprised by the cancellation, especially 
since they were given only about a week's notice that such a session would take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think that a meeting is necessary but we don't believe that FDA will 
take final action till after such a meeting is held," said Carolyn Hayworth, 
public relations manager for Calgene in Davis, Calif. "The consumer reaction to 
BGH may have had some hindrance on the FDA and its final approval of the Flavr 
Savr." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the FDA appears to want to make a public demonstration that it has 
thoroughly reviewed the Flavr Savr. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles M. Benbrook Ph.D, a Washington-based agriculture consultant, agreed 
that the FDA is being especially cautious about Flavr Savr because of its 
experience with BGH, now being marketed by the Monsanto Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Just Monday a Washington advocacy group, the Pure Food Campaign, placed a 
full-page advertisement in the New York Times that was extremely critical of 
the FDA's approval of BGH and its subsequent presence in the dairy supply. 
Among other things, Pure Food denounced the FDA decision against labeling milk 
products derived from cows treated with BGH. 
</P>
<P>
 Benbrook, former executive director for the National Research Council's Board 
on Agriculture, said that in the aftermath of BGH, Calgene will likely be 
required by FDA to label its Flavr Savr tomato as a product of biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The strength of negative consumer reaction to BGH makes labeling fait 
accompli for Calgene," he said. "I'm sure it is aggravating and very 
disappointing for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the hearing cancellation, FDA delays prompted Calgene to lay off 
an undisclosed number of employees at Calgene Fresh, a subsidiary formed to 
distribute the Flavr Savr. Initially, Calgene Fresh was test-marketing 
conventionally grown and vine-ripened tomatoes that approximated the care that 
will be needed to pack and distribute the Flavr Savr. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Hayworth said that Calgene Fresh was losing too many of the vine-ripened 
tomatoes to spoilage during the 18-month pilot project and that the firm 
decided to pull back operations in order to control costs. Calgene's 
conventional tomatoes, marketed under the MacGregor label, are sold to more 
than 500 supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said that the Flavr Savr tomato, upon FDA approval, will not have 
as high a spoilage rate as conventional vine-ripened fruit. Hayworth estimates 
that the Flavr Savr could be in supermarkets within four weeks of getting the 
government green light. 
</P>
<P>
 All the delays, however, have allowed Calgene competitors using conventional 
breeding practices to improve on the quality of commercial tomatoes now on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole industry has changed dramatically in the last year," said David 
Marguleas, senior vice president for Sun World International, which markets the 
DiVine Ripe Tomato. "More specifically, many of the tomatoes we find in 
supermarkets today are improved varieties with better flavor, color, shelf life 
and size." 
</P>
<P>
 Marguleas asked: "If you can produce a superior-tasting, fresh market tomato 
with conventional breeding -- and many growers are doing just that today -- 
then why mess with a genetically engineered product and all the emotional, 
political and environmental concerns that go along with it?" He also questioned 
Calgene's contention that it trimmed its test distribution because of spoilage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate for the public to think that the reason they can't bring up a 
product is because they are throwing too many away. That sounds like the 
reasoning of someone who doesn't understand agriculture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than spoilage, Marguleas says that the most common reason produce 
companies get into trouble is because of overproduction and resulting low 
prices. At present, he said there is a glut of tomatoes coming from Mexico at 
less than half the regular price for this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgene's Hayworth said the company expects its losses for the fiscal year 
ending June 30 to exceed the $25.6 million loss from the previous year. The 
company's stock price has also declined in the wake of the FDA's cancellation 
of the Flavr Savr hearing.

NO BAG THRILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAN BERGER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The quality of bag-in-box wines is, in general, better than a decade ago, 
mainly because of better technology and better grapes. But most of these wines 
still are little more than simple jug wine dispensed from a bag instead of a 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing one must deal with is the spigot. Getting it out of the carton 
isn't easy. First you punch out a cardboard disc, peel back a flap, find the 
rubber spigot, and then try to grasp it -- easier said than done. Once the 
spigot is out, the flap may be pushed back into place. To pour the wine, you 
lift up on the small lever inside the spigot while holding a glass underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 One maddening problem is drip. Spigots are not perfectly tight; most of them 
drip. Every one we tried did and a few even waited until we had taken the glass 
away from the spigot to begin. On occasion, I held my glass under the spigot a 
full five seconds after releasing the lever, only to have a drip hit the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem: The only practical way to get a bag-in-box wine cold is to 
put it in the refrigerator for many hours. Unlike bottles, boxed wine can't be 
immersed in ice. (I tried it; the cardboard got wet and collapsed. I was left 
with a formless bag that was even more difficult to dispense.) 
</P>
<P>
 As for the wines, there was nothing particularly thrilling about any of them. 
The best was probably the Franzia Chardonnay ($10.99 for five liters), which 
didn't taste much like Chardonnay but was a decent drink. Muscat was the main 
aroma of the wine, and in spite of its soft, quaffable taste, the wine offered 
good balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Also tasty, though softer and slightly sweeter, was Franzia French Colombard 
($8.88), with a light floral, melon aroma and a very soft, sweet aftertaste. 
(Served very cold, the wine wasn't bad.) 
</P>
<P>
 I had hoped the Franzia Sauvignon Blanc ($10.99) would be better, but it had a 
candied aroma and a dull taste, lacking any varietal character. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the White Grenache wines, the Franzia was tolerable, with an orange peel 
aroma and some Muscat notes. The Peter Vella from Gallo was far too sweet and 
cloying. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the red wines in the box did very well at all, most of them being too 
raisin-y in aroma, too sweet, and too tannic for the kind of wines they are 
supposed to be. DAN BERGER

 The City Council, hoping to lessen the impact that guest houses and other 
back-yard structures have on nearby residents, has adopted new construction 
standards for guest houses that can be used as separate living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began regulating the construction of guest houses three years ago, 
after residents complained that some of the dwellings were too big for the land 
on which they were built.Residents also complained of problems related to the 
presence of additional residents, such as lack of parking space. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners must now provide additional parking space if a new guest house 
exceeds 400 square feet, or about the size of a large bedroom, according to the 
new guidelines. Two- and three-story additions require a permit, and kitchens 
are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules apply to any guest house separate from a main dwelling that has 
three or fewer rooms. Covered patios, cabanas and hobby, rumpus and recreation 
rooms are included. Existing guest houses are exempt. ANDREW LePAGE

<P>
 Candidate Gary L. Barcome has dropped out of the race for Artesia City Council 
and has thrown his support behind two other challengers seeking to unseat 
incumbents Mary Alyce Soares and Mayor James A. Van Horn Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Barcome, 48, said he feared that three challengers would dilute the vote in 
the April 12 election. He and challengers Timothy Kelemen and John Lyon have 
been running on a slate against Soares and Van Horn.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of low- and moderate-income families are expected to participate in a 
drawing for a chance to buy one of 11 new homes built by the city's 
redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications will be accepted until Friday, and the drawing will be late this 
month or early next month.About 180 people attended an orientation meeting last 
month, said City Administrator Nelson Oliva. 
</P>
<P>
 The income ceiling for a family of four is about $38,000. The homes, which 
have three bedrooms, a garage and at least two baths, will be sold for 
$150,000. The city will provide some financing to residents who qualify, Oliva 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 homes represent the first stage of an effort to provide housing for 
low- and moderate-income families. The city plans to have 50 homes built by 
next summer, Oliva said. JOHN COX

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SANTA FE SPRINGS; CITY TARGETS GUN SHOPS AND MASSAGE PARLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are making it more difficult for operators of gun shops and 
massage parlors to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has approved an ordinance requiring gun store owners to 
secure a conditional-use permit from the city. Until last week, gun store 
owners were only required to file an application with the state Alcohol and 
Beverage Control Commission before opening, Asst. City Manager Fred Latham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also adopted a 45-day ban on massage parlors while planning 
officials determine whether local ordinances need to be strengthened. The ban 
was approved after the city received an application for a massage parlor. No 
massage parlors are operating in the city, Latham said.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SIGNAL HILL; DEVELOPER ABANDONS HILLTOP HOUSING EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The development company that has feuded with city officials for years over 
plans to build on 125 acres of hilltop land -- the small city's prime resource 
-- has been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Southwest Diversified Inc., has left the city to coordinate other 
projects, a company spokesman said.The Signal Hill project will be taken over 
by Southwest's financial partner, Coscan-Davidson Homes. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the shift will have little direct impact on plans to build 
525 dwellings -- a mix of apartments, condominiums and houses -- on the hill. 
Construction on the first phase, a 42-unit condominium at the base of the hill 
near Cherry Avenue, is scheduled to begin by May. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Councilman Gerard Goedhart said that because of strained past 
relations, the change will be "a positive move forward for the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest sued Signal Hill twice after the city blocked the developer's plans 
for higher-density development. The first lawsuit was settled out of court in 
1990, and the second was dropped after Southwest finally agreed to the 
scaled-back plan in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also came under fire that year when several council members who 
were seeking reelection claimed the developer was trying to influence voters to 
support candidates sympathetic to its agenda. Southwest officials denied the 
charges. The candidates in favor of slow growth retained control of the 
council. JOHN POPE

WESTSIDE WATCH: SINGER'S PANAMA PLATFORM REVEALS THAT SANTA MONICA ZEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let it never be said that we don't keep track of Westsiders near and far -- 
especially those running for president in foreign countries. And on a platform 
that seems just right for Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa star and actor Ruben Blades, a former Santa Monica resident, returned to 
his homeland of Panama to run for president. But the singer, known for spicing 
his salsa songs with calls for political and social justice, isn't doing too 
hot in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Blades is running third in the polls, far behind front-runner Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, whose party was affiliated with former dictator Manuel Noriega. 
That was before American troops brought Noriega to Miami in 1990 for trial on 
federal drug charges (he's serving a 40-year sentence). 
</P>
<P>
 Blades, who has appeared in such films as "The Super," "Predator II" and "The 
Milagro Beanfield War," last year had been the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 He has sought to win the presidency through a Santa Monica-style political 
party called Papa Egoro, an Indian term roughly translating to Mother Earth. 
"We don't think or act as a traditional party," he told The Times last year. 
Papa Egoro vows to fight unemployment, hunger and drugs by seeking solutions 
directly from the people. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, by decree, our party reserved 50% of the seats to women. That's an 
example of our attitude. Just like it's a mistake not to ask pregnant women 
before signing a maternity law, we want to make sure we ask everybody for 
opinions on how to solve the country's problems, including children. Consensus 
is the key," Blades said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if he doesn't win the May election, we figure there just might be room 
for Papa Egoro back here.

 NOVELTY ITEMS: If necessity is the mother of invention, politics might be the 
dad. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how it looks in West Hollywood lately, where the election season has 
produced a flurry of experimental new laws. The trend-setting continued Monday, 
when council members Paul Koretz and Abbe Land each sponsored novel measures in 
the midst of rival state Assembly campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Koretz's measure, which passed 5 to 0, would make West Hollywood the first 
city in the country to require all new buildings to be equipped with outlets 
for recharging electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers will have to provide one recharging station for every 10 parking 
spaces -- and foot the bill, estimated at $300 to $1,000 per space. 
</P>
<P>
 Koretz trotted out "Baywatch" actress Alexandra Paul, an electric car driver, 
to provide star quality to his news conference on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Land had her own newsmaker on the agenda: a package of local measures seeking 
to keep out new gun shops. The council has endorsed the idea, which would 
require training and background checks of new dealers and employees, open sales 
records to the city, and keep shops at least 500 feet from schools. The seven 
gun stores and pawnshops that sell guns in the city will face relicensing 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Land and Koretz have staged media events to propose separate 
city measures on gun control -- moves surely made with an eye on voters in the 
liberal Assembly district. Eight Democrats are vying for the seat being vacated 
by Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Land shrugged off suggestions of election-year gimmickry. "Crime is not an 
election-year issue," she said. "The question is, do you not do something 
because it looks like grandstanding, or do you do something?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 JUDICIAL POLITICS: Veteran political consultant Joe Cerrell believes 
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) pulled a fast one on him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of his campaign for a Superior Court judgeship, Friedman dropped 
Cerrell, who insiders say used his muscle in the local political arena to 
dissuade potential candidates, particularly lower court judges, from 
challenging the lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the filing period for judicial seats closed last month, Cerrell said 
he never heard from Friedman again. And when a Cerrell staff member called 
Friedman's office about the consultant fee for the next phase of the campaign, 
he was informed that Friedman had decided to manage the campaign himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerrell, who has handled the campaigns of nearly all winning Los Angeles 
County judicial candidates for almost two decades, was shocked. "I've never had 
it happen before in 16 years of doing judicial elections," said Cerrell. "I was 
surprised and disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said he never discussed hiring Cerrell for the entire campaign, in 
which he is running against Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Schirn and attorney John 
Moriarity.

CITY HALL NEWS; THE REGION; MAYORS AGAIN UNABLE TO FILL AQMD VACANCY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley cities and the county's other suburbs will be without 
representation on the Southland's air quality board for a second month because 
their mayors failed for a fourth time to fill an open seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite several roll calls at a meeting of mayors last Thursday, none of three 
Valley candidates garnered enough votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest stalemate led angry mayors to call for reform in the way board 
seats are filled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a change in the statute that regulates how this is done," 
said Sierra Madre Mayor Clem L. Bartolai. The winning candidate must earn votes 
of 42 cities with a total population of at least 2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors deadlocked on Pomona Councilwoman Nell Soto and La Canada 
Flintridge Councilwoman Joan C. Feehan. La Puente Councilman Louis R. Perez 
dropped out after the first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Soto won the votes of 37 cities with 2.1 million residents. But 
she could not attract further support from the backers of Feehan, who is seen 
as having stronger environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Since November, the mayors have met four times to elect a replacement for 
Henry Morgan, who was recalled from the Covina City Council.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: CERRITOS; RESIDENTS TO GET THEIR OWN ZIP CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cerritos residents will have a ZIP code of their own beginning July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials agreed to give the city a separate mailing code -- 90703 -- 
after a majority of residents said in a survey last fall that they preferred a 
separate code. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Cerritos residents have been sharing the 90701 ZIP code with their 
neighbors in Artesia. City officials have been trying to make a break with 
Artesia since 1986, when a branch of the Artesia Post Office opened on 
Carmenita Road near 183rd Street in Cerritos. Cerritos postal customers often 
complained that their mail was being delayed or returned because of confusion 
over where they live, city officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials last year agreed to survey more than 17,000 Cerritos 
households and businesses, asking if they preferred their own ZIP code. More 
than 6,650 surveys were returned, with 57% supporting the new ZIP code, 
according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The change does not come without hassles. Fifty-six carrier routes will have 
to be altered out of the Artesia Post Office to serve Cerritos alone, which 
also could cause delays in delivering some mail, postal officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos mail will still be sorted and delivered out of the main Artesia post 
office, city officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The 84 Cerritos homes that now receive mail through La Palma will not use the 
new ZIP code. In their survey, residents chose to leave their 90623 ZIP code 
unchanged. JILL GOTTESMAN

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LAKEWOOD; FIRM HIRED TO DEVISE PLAN FOR EX-NAVAL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lakewood officials who have been feuding with Long Beach over how to use the 
site of the vacant Long Beach Naval Hospital will spend $50,000 to draft their 
own plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's redevelopment directors voted unanimously recently to hire a 
Diamond Bar-based consulting firm, GRC-Copenhaver Inc., to prepare alternative 
proposals for the Navy to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood has argued that Long Beach's plan to build a large retail shopping 
center on the Naval Hospital property -- three miles from the Lakewood Center 
Mall -- would cripple the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials decided to reopen discussions about the use of the site on 
Carson Street west of the San Gabriel River Freeway. The first hearing will be 
April 5 at 7 p.m. at Lakewood City Hall, city spokesman Don Waldie said. A 
second hearing is expected to be scheduled in Long Beach. JOHN POPE

INVESTMENT FIRM RAIDED IN FRAUD INVESTIGATION; BUSINESS: ILLEGAL OR NONEXISTENT 
COMMODITIES TRADING IS SUSPECTED. CUSTOMERS, MANY OF THEM CHINESE AMERICAN, SAY 
THEY'VE LOST EVERYTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators are poring through the records of a San Gabriel commodities 
brokerage that they raided and shut down last week to see whether the business 
actually invested the millions of dollars it collected from customers. The 
business had targeted the Chinese American community. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 2, investigators with the state Department of Corporations and the 
federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, along with San Gabriel police and 
representatives of the district attorney's office, raided Lida International 
Financial Data Inc. in San Gabriel. Simultaneously, authorities in Northern 
California raided a sister business, Worth Financial Data Inc., in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigating agencies allege that Lida sold gold, silver and currency 
futures illegally over the last three years. They say Lida and Worth, both 
owned by Topworth International of Hong Kong, sold futures primarily to Asian 
residents of California but did not register their brokers with the trading 
commission. Officials also alleged that the futures, if they existed, were not 
traded on regulated exchanges, as required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by complaints from disgruntled investors who told authorities that 
they lost everything, the Lida investigation is one of several in recent years 
that have focused on allegedly fraudulent investment schemes in the San Gabriel 
Valley's Chinese American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators refer to such cases as "affinity fraud," where members of one 
group -- in this case mostly Chinese Americans -- gain the trust of others 
through their community ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Lida has operated out of a white stucco building on San Gabriel Boulevard for 
about three years. In that time, officials estimate that more than 5,000 
people, mostly of Asian heritage, invested at least $10 million with Lida. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for evidence that there was any trading at all," said 
Department of Corporations spokeswoman Lindsey Kozberg. She said criminal 
charges would be filed if it is determined the trading did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozberg said investors were told their money was being sent to Hong Kong to be 
traded in a precious-metal and foreign-currency exchange there. Authorities 
believe the exchange was not being regulated by Hong Kong officials. 
Authorities said it is extremely difficult to recoup money from fraudulent 
investment schemes, particularly if the funds have been sent overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lida and Worth have been barred from doing business by the state pending a 
federal court hearing later this month. Investigators seized Lida records and 
have frozen about $300,000 in Lida assets and about $75,000 in Worth assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators continue to sift through records to determine who was working 
for Lida, who the investors were and how much money was invested. A 
court-appointed receiver who has taken over the Lida office is searching for 
all assets and will set up a claims procedure for investors seeking the return 
of their money. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Lida Senior Vice President Allen Yang nor General Manager Duvan Chiang 
could be reached for comment. When investigators raided the building, Lida 
employees were training a new class of about 30 salespeople, many recruited 
from USC and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Lida offered clients a virtually impossible combination of high 
returns and low-risk investments. The sales pitches varied, Kozberg said, but 
one investor told investigators she was promised a $2,000 monthly return on a 
$20,000 investment. However, a few months later, the woman closed her account 
with less than $1,000 in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other investors told the Department of Corporations that it became 
increasingly difficult to obtain information on their accounts as they began 
losing money. Kozberg said investors were not receiving regular statements on 
their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that people were opening accounts with $20,000 and closing them with 
less than $500," Kozberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the first two weeks, some received statements indicating a profit," 
she said. "But two weeks later they would find they had lost their $20,000. 
They would get margin calls, in which they were told they would need to supply 
more money to keep their accounts open." 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors who lost money were even urged to join Lida or Worth as 
salespeople in order to earn money to recoup their losses, Kozberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Lida investor, who asked not to be named, said he invested about $20,000 
last year and lost it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first invested with them they told me they were licensed with the 
proper authorities," the San Gabriel Valley man said. "Their offices are very 
plush, they have computers showing the commodities tables and they seemed real 
professional." 
</P>
<P>
 But within four months, he said, Lida informed him he would have to send more 
money in order to keep his account open. 
</P>
<P>
 "There definitely needs to be more education on this issue in the Chinese 
community," said Monterey Park Mayor Pro Tem Judy Chu, whose city was the scene 
of a raid by commodities investigators last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last January, state and local investigators raided the Monterey Park, Pasadena 
and Los Angeles offices of a Hong Kong-based investment conglomerate called Jin 
Bao for allegedly trading off the legitimate market. 
</P>
<P>
 In another highly publicized case, federal authorities shut down East Ocean 
International Inc. in 1992 for allegedly running an illegal Pasadena 
commodities pool and bilking 100 Chinese American investors of more than $1 
million.

AMID CONTROVERSY, ABC DISTRICT SHINES IN STATE TEST RESULTS; EDUCATION: DESPITE 
WRANGLING AMONG TEACHERS, BOARD AND ADMINISTRATION, STUDENTS PLACED HIGHEST 
OVERALL IN SOUTHEAST AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The school board feuds, the teachers and administration fuss, and the 
superintendent is on the outs, but something has gone right in ABC Unified: The 
school district earned high marks on the state's new student achievement tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 18 Southeast-area school systems, ABC Unified had the best or 
near-best scores in every category and at every grade level tested by the exam. 
The district also did better, on average, when compared with similar school 
systems across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The test was given last spring for the first time, and the state released the 
results Wednesday. The California Learning Assessment System, CLAS for short, 
is California's latest attempt to measure how well students know what they 
really need to know. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the results reinforced what previous tests had concluded. ABC Unified 
and the tiny Lowell Joint School District, a Whittier-area elementary school 
system, did well, as they have on more traditional standardized tests. The 
scores in Lynwood Unified and Compton Unified remained low. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Unified landed in the middle of the pack, a showing that Long Beach 
school officials called respectable. Downey officials were puzzled over results 
that were better than expected in some areas and worse than anticipated in 
others. Students in the Whittier Union High School District earned mid-range 
scores, and Paramount Unified had low scores, but students in both school 
systems performed on a par with similar students elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For ABC Unified, the test scores offered a respite from headlines about 
district squabbling and labor strife. For two years, the administration and the 
teachers union have battled over salaries, class sizes and other issues. The 
district of 21,000 students serves Cerritos, Artesia, Hawaiian Gardens and 
parts of Lakewood and Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees called Supt. Larry L. Lucas autocratic and said morale was at an 
all-time low. District administrators accused teachers of making unreasonable 
demands, politicizing their classrooms and involving students in labor 
disputes. Meanwhile, the divided school board would bicker publicly for hours 
over issues large and small. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the midst of it all, students took the new state test and did 
themselves proud. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were particularly strong on the eighth-grade writing test, where 
66% of ABC Unified students scored 4 or better on the 6-point grading scale; 5% 
of the students earned a 6, the top score. In Los Angeles County, only Beverly 
Hills Unified had a higher percentage of students with the top score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised we did well," said Deputy Supt. Ira Toibin. "We had been 
working on modifying our system in anticipation of the change. We began to work 
hard to change our curriculum." The new test "requires a whole different 
approach in terms of writing and math." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional standardized tests had relied on banks of multiple-choice 
questions. The new test used more open-ended questions, some of which required 
essay responses. Students had to write essay answers even to math questions. 
Unlike in past tests, students were allowed to use calculators. And some tasks 
required students to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in grades four, eight and 10 took tests in reading, writing and 
mathematics. The test measured students against rigorous statewide performance 
standards set by educators, school board members, business leaders and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all Southeast school systems had considerable room for improvement, 
particularly in mathematics, where scores were the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th-grade math scores in ABC, for example, were among the best in the 
county, but only 19% of ABC students demonstrated higher-level math skills by 
scoring a 4 or better. In Long Beach Unified, only 7% of 10th-graders scored a 
4 or better in math, yet that was better than eight of the Southeast area's 12 
high school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have learned that our emphasis needs to change to include more writing in 
mathematics," said Long Beach Assistant Supt. Lew Prilliman. "I am sure that's 
what pulled our scores down." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Prilliman said, he was pleased by the scores in Long Beach Unified, a 
district of 77,000 students. The scores were as good or slightly better than 
scores of similar students elsewhere in all but a few categories. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC Unified prepared for the test by taking some teachers out of the classroom 
and assigning them to revise what would be taught in the classroom, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key now is not to tell students so much up front, but to cause them, 
through exploration, to come to a fuller understanding of what math is," Toibin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one second-grade class, for example, a group of students received a long 
sheet of cardboard. The teacher told students to stand the cardboard on its end 
and to cut three small circles. The holes had to be just large enough for a 
student to put his or her head through. And the circles had to be positioned so 
that each student could do this without stooping or stretching. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish this task, the students had to hypothesize, measure, calculate, 
average and estimate. And they had to work together. "They were doing very 
sophisticated kinds of math in that particular activity," Toibin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toibin credited Supt. Lucas with pushing this reform project forward. The 
school board also deserved praise, he said, for approving funds for the effort 
during hard economic times that resulted in widespread budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board majority, which had been critical of Lucas, recently placed 
him on leave for unspecified reasons. The superintendent's departure won't 
affect scores because the credit for the students' performance belongs 
elsewhere, said Laura Rico, co-president of the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have good teachers and good students, which is a wonderful combination," 
Rico said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new tests reward good writing skills, and that's what put the Lowell Joint 
School District in the upper echelon, said Supt. Ronald T. Randolph. On the 
writing test, 72% of the fourth-graders scored a 4 or better on the 6-point 
scale. For several years, teachers and administrators in the Whittier-area 
school system of 2,839 students have concentrated on improving student writing, 
Randolph said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell Joint and ABC Unified serve student populations with many well-educated 
or affluent parents. As always, such districts scored higher than other school 
systems. For that reason, school officials pay close attention to the scores of 
school districts considered similar to their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The scores in Downey Unified, for example, were respectable, but somewhat 
worse than those in similar districts statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did fine overall," said Downey Supt. Edward A. Sussman. "Our math scores 
were low, and our writing scores were unusually high. The results are confusing 
for us because our math scores have always been above the national norm. And 
normally our writing scores are kind of average. I don't know what to make of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Unified, on the other hand, came in with scores among the lowest in 
the county, but results that compared favorably in several categories to 
similar school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whittier Union High School District, which received mid-range scores, can 
take solace in performing slightly better than comparable school districts in 
reading and writing. Officials credit the district's participation in the 
pilot-testing program that helped create the new tests. District administrators 
and teachers got a good sense of what the test would be like and were able to 
prepare students, said Assistant Supt. Marina Anaya. 
</P>
<P>
 The scores were discouraging just about any way you slice them in Compton 
Unified, a district of 27,300 students .  
</P>
<P>
 The district's scores were at or near the bottom for Los Angeles County at 
every grade level and in every category. Some Compton schools held their own 
when compared with similar schools elsewhere, but the district overall fared 
poorly on average compared to other school systems with a similar student 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't say the school district alone has let the kids down," said school 
board member Amen Rahh. "It's the whole atmosphere, the business people, the 
community members. It's that parent who doesn't even ask the kid: 'Do you have 
homework?' And the student who will listen to (rap artist) Snoop Doggy Dog 
rather than the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as an educator, if I know that students aren't getting help at home, I 
have to compensate and find another way to get help to them. That's what the 
school district has to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's new state-appointed administrator, J. Jerome Harris, vowed to 
improve the students' scores by improving the performance of school district 
employees. On Tuesday, he and 17 staffers swooped down on Whaley Middle School 
to analyze what the school was doing right and wrong. The other schools will 
get similar visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guarantee you this time next year we won't be on the bottom," Harris said.

TEST SCORES REVEAL MATH DEFICIENCIES; SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAY RESULTS SHOULD BE A 
CALL TO ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Westside schools made mixed grades in California's new test for elementary, 
middle and high school students. But they had one thing in common: Virtually 
all scored poorly in math. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing scores of Westside students ran the gamut on the 
California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) test, given for the first time 
last spring. Beverly Hills Unified led the pack with some of the best results 
in the county, while Los Angeles Unified ranked near the bottom countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 But math scores were uniformly disappointing. Even in Beverly Hills -- 
overall, the best-performing of the four school districts serving the Westside 
-- only a quarter of fourth-graders were found to understand "essential" 
mathematical ideas. In Los Angeles Unified, only 3% of fourth-graders 
demonstrated that level of math understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say the test results should be taken as a call to action. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this is acceptable," said Mark Slavkin, who represents much of the 
Westside on the Los Angeles Unified school board. "We're going to have to do 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the CLAS test, California students for the first time were graded 
against performance standards set by educators, school board members, business 
leaders and parents -- not against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Student scores were rated on a scale of one to six -- six being excellent, one 
being the poorest. The test replaced the California Assessment Program (CAP) 
test, which had been administered in the state since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the new test has been given only once, education officials have no means 
of comparing the scores released this week with those of previous years. Even 
so, educators say, the test results offer a useful measure of schools' 
strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, reading and writing scores ranged dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 At Beverly Vista Elementary in Beverly Hills, for instance, 93% of the 
eighth-graders showed a "thoughtful understanding" of the text on the reading 
portion of the test, meaning they scored in the 4-to-6 range. And 91% of those 
students were able to score 4 or above on the writing portion, meaning their 
writing was "coherent, adequately organized and developed." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica/Malibu Unified, and at Culver City Middle School, slightly 
more than half of the eighth-graders scored four or above on the reading and 
writing tests. In Los Angeles Unified, about a quarter of the eighth-graders 
scored four or higher in reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the reading and writing test for 10th-graders, students from the Beverly 
Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica/Malibu Unified districts ranked in the top 
20 of the 50 high school districts in Los Angeles County, while Los Angeles 
Unified came in 40th. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Beverly Hills High showed the strongest performance among Westside high 
schools, its reading scores were not uniformly strong. Only 40% of the school's 
10th-graders demonstrated a solid understanding of the text they read. Writing, 
however, was another story: 75% of the 10th-grade students wrote clearly and 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles Unified high schools, reading and writing scores were generally 
poor. At Los Angeles High School, for instance, only 5% of 10th-grade students 
who took the reading test scored four or higher. And on the writing test, 74% 
of the 10th-graders scored at or below three, meaning they "had difficulty 
communicating the writer's knowledge and values." 
</P>
<P>
 Educators offer a variety of explanations for the disparity in reading and 
writing results, citing factors ranging from socioeconomic differences to 
teacher preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mar Vista Elementary, a Los Angeles Unified school that scored relatively 
well in the CLAS test, Principal Monica Friedman said the school succeeded in 
part because teachers revised their method of instruction in anticipation of 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that effort, the school's fourth-grade teachers last year attended 
a UCLA workshop to learn how to help students develop skills needed for the new 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS test marks a sharp break with the former multiple-choice exam, in 
which students tried to pick a single correct answer -- or guess. Under the new 
test, students have to write at least some answers, respond to open-ended 
questions about literature, for example, or explain how they arrived at 
solutions to math problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Friedman: "We work hard at communication, teaching kids how to explain 
how they got that answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified officials said the district's overall reading and writing 
performance was hampered in part because the district has a large share of 
students with limited English-speaking ability -- 41% compared to 31% 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the reading and writing scores, mathematics results from the CLAS test 
differed from district to district on the Westside. But they varied in a 
narrower range -- from bad to worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though only 25% of Beverly Hills fourth-graders scored four or higher -- 
showing they understood "essential" mathematical ideas -- the district's 
fourth-grade math scores were among the best in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica/Malibu Unified, 16% of fourth-grade students scored four or 
higher. And in the Culver City and Los Angeles Unified districts, the share of 
fourth-graders who scored four or above was 7% and 3%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 In all four Westside school districts, math scores for eighth- and 
10th-graders were generally better, but still weak. School officials say the 
math exam caught teachers and students unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to ask a student to give you the formula for the hypotenuse of 
a right triangle," said Bert Pearlman, an assistant superintendent at Beverly 
Hills Unified school district. "It's another thing to ask a kid to explain how 
he came up with that formula." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials expect the new test results to spur innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Falotico, principal of Los Angeles High school, said that under one such 
reform effort, students will work with teachers in small groups, or "clusters." 
The development of a high school major for each student and a longer school day 
are among other ideas Los Angeles High and other schools are considering to 
improve student performance. 
</P>
<P>
 While unhappy with his district's low test scores, Slavkin said he is 
optimistic that reform efforts will bear fruit. He points to the Los Angeles 
Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now (LEARN) program as one way the 
district is trying to help students succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have poor families, children of immigrants who are really struggling," 
said Slavkin, "and we need to find ways to help these kids. LEARN is a way to 
do this." Sample Scores

FRAMING SCOFFLAWS; MTA TO INSTALL CAMERAS AT 17 BLUE LINE CROSSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pickup truck lingered at the rail lines at a Compton intersection, then 
slipped across the tracks as the barriers slowly descended. A Blue Line train 
sounded its bullhorn about half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Police weren't around to catch the driver, but a camera system installed by 
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was. Several weeks later, MTA 
authorities mailed a $104 citation to the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera was part of a test that worked so well to deter other drivers from 
illegally slipping across the commuter rail line in Compton that the MTA has 
decided to spend $2.5 million to install cameras permanently at 17 problem 
crossings along the Long Beach-Los Angeles line by the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials are counting on the cameras to achieve what common sense 
apparently didn't. They discourage drivers from slipping around lowered 
barriers and cut down on collisions between cars and the trains, which travel 
at speeds of up to 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-resolution cameras were tested last year at two crossings in Compton: 
Alondra and Compton boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The cameras took photographs over a four-month period at Compton Boulevard, 
and operated for three months at the Alondra Boulevard crossing. Signs posted 
near the cameras warned drivers they were being photographed. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the camera was installed at the Compton Boulevard crossing, at least 
one car would race across the tracks every hour while the warning lights were 
flashing or after the barriers had descended. After the installation, the 
number of violations fell to one every 12 hours, MTA officials said. The 
results were similar at Alondra Boulevard crossing.  
</P>
<P>
 "What is causing accidents is people driving around crossing gates," said Jim 
Curry, a consultant who manages the MTA's Blue Line safety program. "If we can 
cut down the number of people driving around the gates, intuitively we have to 
be cutting down the number of accidents."  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the worst accidents have occurred in Compton and Willowbrook, where 
slow-moving freight trains have run on tracks parallel to the Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
 From the rail line's start-up in July, 1990, to last month, there have been 
191 accidents at rail crossings. Fourteen people died in nine of those 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of people being in a hurry," said Capt. Frank Vadurro of the 
Sheriff's Transit Services Bureau, which patrols the Blue Line. "We've heard 
them all. 'I was in a hurry. The gates weren't down.' In this instance, if you 
have a 90,000-pound train coming at you, you're going to lose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last fatal accident occurred Nov. 16 in Willowbrook. Two people died and 
seven were injured when an 18-year-old woman drove into the path of an oncoming 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies handed out 9,300 tickets last year to motorists trying to cross the 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials say they also are examining other safety measures, including 
traffic barriers that stretch across all traffic lanes.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, deputies also began patrolling on motorcycles in an effort to catch 
violators more easily, said sheriff's Lt. Al Frisch, who is in charge of 
security for the Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
 A law that went into effect Jan. 1 carries a stiffer penalty for motorists who 
cross the tracks when the barriers are down. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine is now $204 for the first violation, and $304 for a second offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators also may be required to attend traffic school.  
</P>
<P>
 "Training is better than someone paying a fine," Frisch said. "It's a matter 
of training and educating people."

NEW TACTIC APPEARS TO PAY OFF IN TEST SCORES; EDUCATION: SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT 
REVISED LESSONS TO EMPHASIZE LANGUAGE ARTS AND LOGIC DO COMPARATIVELY WELL IN 
NEW STATE EXAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 San Gabriel Valley school districts that have aggressively revamped lessons to 
reflect a new language arts and math curriculum generally scored higher than 
their neighbors on the new California Learning Assessment System standardized 
tests. The results were released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Walnut High School, which had the highest percentage of students 
in all of Los Angeles County who earned a top score of 6 in math, said it 
recently overhauled its math curriculum to emphasize the logical steps 
necessary to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our math teachers spent a Saturday on their own time designing open-ended 
questions for math so the students aren't just regurgitating information, but 
demonstrating that they can think through the process," Principal Ken Gunn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Armstrong Elementary School in the Pomona Unified district, where 42% of 
students scored 4 or above in reading, Principal Eugene Domeno said teachers 
studied sample test questions provided by the state, then adapted teaching 
methods to reflect the skills measured by the new tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Though state officials said they were disappointed with overall scores -- 
which for the first time measure students against performance standards instead 
of against each other -- they note that districts that traditionally score well 
on standardized tests are still topping the charts in the new CLAS tests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley, schools in San Marino, Arcadia, La Canada, South 
Pasadena, Temple City and Walnut consistently scored high in reading, writing 
and math. Pomona schools scored near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS tests were administered last spring to selected fourth-, eighth- and 
10th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Many individual schools that have historically done well -- even if they are 
in districts with otherwise lackluster scores -- continued that record. All 
three elementary schools in the upper-middle-class Diamond Bar area of the 
Pomona Unified district scored high. At Brightwood School in Monterey Park, a 
middle-income, multicultural school where scores in the standardized tests the 
state formerly used shot up 46% in 10 years, fourth-graders ranked third in 
reading in Los Angeles County this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our teaching is in line with the framework, and CLAS tests the framework," 
said Grace Love, Brightwood's principal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new tests also show the difficulties of trying to draw conclusions 
based on raw data from one year of testing, and on samples that can vary from 
11 students per test group to thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, South Pasadena Unified was fourth in Los Angeles County in math, 
fifth in reading, and ninth in writing. Anita Thompson, the district's 
assistant superintendent for instructional services, credits the scores to her 
district's embrace of literature-based learning, which applies even to math. 
</P>
<P>
 But South Pasadena Continuation High School students scored at the very bottom 
of all Los Angeles County 10th-graders in writing. Few of them were able to 
communicate in a clear, adequately organized way, according to the test 
standards, and the majority wrote incoherently and made errors in spelling, 
grammar and punctuation. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena officials say they are reluctant to draw conclusions about the 
dismal showing of their continuation students because only 11 took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing raw numbers, the CLAS tests allow a district to gauge 
how it performed against 100 school districts with similar income and 
educational levels. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Duarte Unified had a relatively poor academic performance 
overall, but ranked high against 100 comparable districts. In reading, 39% of 
the students scored 4 or above, while the figure for comparable districts was 
only 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona schools scored near the bottom overall, but district officials say that 
is not surprising in a comparison with schools in Beverly Hills or La Canada. 
When measured against similar districts, Pomona looks much better. 
</P>
<P>
 In fourth grade, for instance, about half the Pomona schools outperformed 
their comparison schools, said Jill Fulton, coordinator of curriculum 
instruction and staff development. In middle school, about half performed 
better or as well as their socioeconomic peers in reading and writing.

SHE GIVES A VOICE TO CRIME VICTIMS; ACTIVISM: DEBORAH COATS' SON WAS THE 
INNOCENT VICTIM OF GANG GUNFIRE. SHE GRIEVES PRIVATELY BUT IS OUTSPOKEN IN HER 
MESSAGE ABOUT VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind a microphone, Deborah Coats betrays no hint of the grief she still 
carries for her 14-year-old son, Stephen, gunned down Halloween night on a 
Pasadena sidewalk, an innocent victim of gang rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I speak, I speak as a whole person," Coats said. "My grief is private." 
</P>
<P>
 That grief has propelled Coats into the limelight and onto a new mission: 
speaking out about families and crime. A panelist last month at Gov. Pete 
Wilson's crime summit, the subject of two television profiles and a guest 
speaker on school campuses and before parent-teacher associations, Coats 
impresses others with her strength, composure and common-sense advice, said 
Lisa Bierer, a Wilson aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't say enough nice things about her," Bierer added. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 38-year-old Coats calls herself simply an "average citizen" with a 
message to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a legislator. I'm not a politician," she said. "I just know that 
something has to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Coats' life, if it is indeed average as she claims, speaks to the 
vulnerability of families struggling to live peaceably in violence-ridden 
times. She herself survived a sexual assault at age 20 and a home invasion 
robbery in Los Angeles three years later before moving her family to what she 
thought would be the safer streets of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 6 1/2 years as a crime scene investigator for the Pasadena Police 
Department were no preparation for the sight of her son, sprawled and bleeding 
on the sidewalk half a block from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Coats was shot and killed as he and nine other boys returned from an 
adult-chaperoned Halloween party. Police say that gang members, seeking revenge 
for the shooting two hours earlier of one of their own, mistook the boys for 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Two gunmen sprang from behind bushes and opened fire with semiautomatic 
weapons. They killed Stephen, Edgar Evans, 13, and Reggie Crawford, 14, and 
wounded three other boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Five alleged gang members now face murder charges. The five -- Aurelius 
Bailey, 19, Solomon Bowen, 18, and Herbert McClain, 25, of Pasadena, Karl 
Holmes, 19, of Altadena, and Lorenzo Newborn, 23, of Los Angeles -- are 
scheduled to appear March 23 in Pasadena Superior Court, where trial dates for 
them could be set. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids had done everything I asked them to do and I still lost a son to gang 
warfare," Coats said recently inside police headquarters, where she works. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a black police jumpsuit similar to that of patrol officers except 
with no gun, Coats fielded work calls at her desk. Her aggressively cheerful 
demeanor changed only once, when, in a strict serious tone, she counseled one 
of her three other children over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "10-4," she said, ending the conversation with a bit of police lingo she uses 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Coats would have been out in the streets at a rape, robbery or 
murder scene. She and other investigators work behind the yellow tape stretched 
across such sites by police. In a job that can sometimes take 17 hours at a 
stretch, she takes photographs and collects fingerprints, hair, spent bullets 
and other clues to help detectives solve crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she came back to work two weeks after her son's slaying, she said she 
found the crime scenes troubling. So, instead, she has been doing lab work 
inside police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that yellow (police) tape went up when my son was shot, I was on the 
other side of it," Coats said. "I never thought I'd be on the other side of it. 
My poor co-workers, they had to take pictures of my son's dead body." 
</P>
<P>
 The last few months have been tough for her and her other children, Stephanie, 
17, Kenneth, 13, and Kristina, 12, she said. She buried Stephen on Nov. 8. The 
family struggled through Stephen's birthday, Dec. 2. Then, they faced Christmas 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have three children with very broken hearts," she said. "We're still trying 
to heal." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Los Angeles and raised in Pasadena, Coats never set her sights on 
police work. She dreamed of being a doctor but left college at 18 to care for 
four younger sisters when her mother became ill and was bedridden five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Coats got a job, married and moved to Los Angeles. The family's new 
neighborhood was relatively good, she said. Still, one night as she waited for 
a ride at a corner bus stop, a burly man dragged her behind a house, raped her 
and fled, she said. She never got a good look at him and he was never caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, a robber posing as a painter knocked on her door. Stephen, 
then 3, innocently opened it. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber handcuffed Coats' hands behind her and threw her into a bedroom 
while he ransacked the house. Despite the handcuffs, she managed to pry open a 
bedroom window. Her screams attracted neighbors, who called police. But the man 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 The two incidents prompted her to move her family to Altadena. A search for a 
job with medical benefits led her, in 1987, to answer an ad for a Pasadena 
police assistant. She quickly found out that what she assumed was a clerk's job 
was instead a spot on the front lines at crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 She takes pride in her work and has come to regard her co-workers as family 
members who share in her and her children's lives. Quoting the caption on a 
photo Christmas card she sent to fellow employees one year, she said: "Everyone 
knows 'Debbie Coats and her little jackets.' "  
</P>
<P>
 When her son was killed, department employees grieved with her and provided 
support, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, she did not speak out. Instead, in those first few days, she avoided 
television cameras and microphones and let her ex-husband, Stephen -- they were 
divorced five years ago -- represent the family. Only after she felt composed 
enough to go before cameras did she begin what she said is a necessary job: 
getting out the message against crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Coats is a very, very strong, lovely women . . . very inspiring," said 
Luane Oberholtzer, an administrator at John Muir High School, where Coats spoke 
at a memorial service shortly after her son's death. "She has an enormous 
amount to say about students and the fact that they need to make choices in 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Coats also has advice to parents. "Parents, introduce yourselves to your 
children," she said at the governor's crime summit. "Take the time to find out 
what your children are up to!" 
</P>
<P>
 Besides attention, children need a good education, safe parks and centers 
where they can gather, all part of the fight against crime, she said. She also 
believes that convicted criminals should serve at least 95% of their sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go out and speak, it's my way of thanking all the people who have been 
supportive," she said. "I don't think I will ever be able to repay all the 
kindness and understanding and prayers."

COMMUNITY NEWS: PICO RIVERA; GROUP PETITIONS FOR SMALLER SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A community group has launched a campaign to trim the seven-member El Rancho 
Unified School District Board of Education to five members. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the effort began circulating petitions this week to try to force an 
election on the issue.Organizers must present at least 250 valid signatures to 
the County Committee on School District Organization, which oversees changes in 
political boundaries and organization of school districts in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers contend that the size of the board has led to conflicts and 
instability in the leadership of the 10,000-student district, which serves Pico 
Rivera. They point to the recent ouster of Supt. John T. Sherman, a veteran 
district employee, who was the fourth El Rancho schools chief to leave the 
district in five years.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; SCHOOL'S NOD TO LATINO CANDIDATES CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Long Beach Unified school superintendent and school board members have 
urged voters to cast ballots for one of two Latino candidates vying for a board 
seat in the April 12 election, a move criticized by the third contender, who is 
not Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter signed by Supt.Carl Cohn and the five board members did not endorse 
the Latino candidates by name, but said: "The Latino population . . . served by 
the Long Beach Unified School District deserves -- yes, even demands -- a board 
member representing them." 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia Herrera, a community activist, and Jerome Torres, a city employee, are 
running for the District 3 seat being vacated by the board's only Latina, Jenny 
Oropeza, who is seeking a City Council seat. The third board candidate, who 
criticized the letter, is Bonnie Lowenthal, a white family counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "District elections were not about race," said Lowenthal, who cites her 
longtime involvement in the Latino and Cambodian communities. "The community 
has a right to make the choice it wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn was unavailable for comment. But Board President Karin Polacheck said the 
letter was not intended to be racist. She pointed out that more than a third of 
the district's 77,000 students are Latino. The District 3 seat represents 
central Long Beach, an area populated predominantly by Latinos, African 
Americans and Asian Americans.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; OFFERING A PICTURE-PERFECT VIEW OF CITY'S RICH PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1920s photo of Long Beach with a crush of visitors between the Pine Avenue 
Pier in the foreground and a roller coaster in the background brought back 
memories to Zona Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a holiday, it was so crowded you could hardly move," said Forbes, 75. "My 
dad used to hike me up on his shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes is the archivist for the Historical Society of Long Beach, which last 
week had a ribbon-cutting ceremony and reception to celebrate the opening of 
its new gallery and research center in a Pine Avenue storefront downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach photo is among dozens on display in the gallery. There are photos of 
the Pike Amusement area at the turn of the century, oil derricks that studded 
Signal Hill during the 1930s and warships built at the Naval Shipyard during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 One photo may strike an ominous note with some visitors. It shows two dented 
cars half buried by falling bricks during the 1933 Long Beach earthquake that 
registered 6.3 on the Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think its an incredible photograph," said Patrick Miller, 22, a Long Beach 
City College student who was visiting. "I feel this (gallery) is a great step 
toward gaining pride in Long Beach. For a lot of people, this is not a huge 
city and it's not a small town. It's just sort of where they end up." 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery at 418 Pine Ave. also has an assortment of relics. Suspended 
overhead is a two-foot-long wood and aluminum model of a World War II biplane 
built by Douglas Aircraft Co. In a corner sits a sandstone shield with an 
ornate coat of arms topped with a full-winged eagle. It is all that is left of 
the Pacific Coast Club, a structure of Norman architecture on Ocean Boulevard 
that hosted dances, dinners and cotillions until it was torn down in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the place to be," said Barbara Barnes, president of the historical 
society. "I was sad about (the demolition)." 
</P>
<P>
 The historical society's archives have at least 25,000 photos of people, 
points of interest and aerial shots of the city, plus extensive books, maps and 
city brochures. Dusty phone directories go back to 1902. The city was founded 
in 1884. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have a record of your family, you don't know where you are," 
Barnes said. "It's the same with a city. You have to have some feeling for your 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 The society received a $30,000 city redevelopment grant and $30,000 in private 
donations to remodel the storefront, which earlier housed a check-cashing 
business. Long Beach Plaza officials donated the space for the organization, 
which previously operated out of cramped quarters in the Long Beach Senior 
Center on East Fourth Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery is open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; 12-STORY HOTEL ACCUSED OF SAFETY VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Operators of a 430-room Los Angeles hotel are facing criminal charges after an 
investigation into violations of fire, health and safety standards, authorities 
said this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The 12-story Frontier Hotel on West 5th Street is one of the larger hotels to 
prompt a criminal filing since the Los Angeles city attorney's Housing 
Enforcement Unit was established five years ago, Deputy City Atty.Janet Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Michael Frontiera, 64, of San Pedro, his sons Joseph Frontiera, 37, of 
Rancho Palos Verdes and Robert Frontiera, 34, of Long Beach, and hotel manager 
David Michael Johnson, 36, of Dove Canyon, are expected to be charged at their 
arraignment April 7 with 23 fire, health and building and safety code 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Frontiera acknowledged that the hotel needed work, but said the owners 
had been given insufficient time to complete an estimated $280,000 in repairs 
demanded by the city last September. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ted Goldstein, spokesman for the city attorney's office, said, "There's 
exposed live electrical wiring, an over-fused electrical panel, defective 
electrical and plumbing fixtures. . . . It's not as though we're asking for 
luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 Reopened by the current owners in 1979 after being closed for 22 years, the 
Frontier Hotel houses low-income residents and welfare recipients.

HEALTH; INSURANCE FIRM TOLD TO PAY FOR HOME CARE; COVERAGE: COVINA MAYOR PRO 
TEM IS SUING PROVIDERS WHO DISPUTE HER SONS' NEED FOR NIGHT NURSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An insurance provider was ordered last week to provide in-home nighttime 
nursing care for 8-year-old Covina twins who risk heart and lung failure 
whenever they fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary injunction issued by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge 
Diane Wayne forces the state's Public Employees Retirement System to pay for 
100 four-hour nursing visits while a lawsuit over the twins' care wends its way 
through court. 
</P>
<P>
 If the lawsuit against the retirement system is not resolved before the 100 
visits are exhausted, PERS will have to provide full-time hospitalization for 
the boys, according to the tentative ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the boys' mother, Covina Mayor Pro Tem Linda Sarver, filed suit 
against PERS, which funds the insurance; Blue Shield, the claims administrator; 
and Healthmarc, which advises PERS on what kind of care a patient needs. In 
November, Healthmarc officials told Sarver the nighttime nursing visits were 
not medically necessary and would not be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision, Sarver said, "was like someone telling me my children 
are probably going to live, rather than that they are probably going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley and Steven Sarver suffer from a rare central nervous system disorder 
that sometimes causes their hearts and lungs to fail while they sleep. Their 
nighttime nurses' job had been to anticipate and respond to the boys' apnea, or 
cessation of breathing, and bradycardia, the slowing of the heart rate. The 
boys' physician said their chances of serious injury were increased by the lack 
of night nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blue Shield attorney Rick Zimmerman said that the nurses' records he has 
so far reviewed do not prove the need for that level of care to safeguard the 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's conflicting information on what these nurses are doing, and how much 
of it is medically necessary," Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sarvers' previous health insurance company had paid for home nursing 
nearly all the twins' lives. The twins are insured through their father, a 
Beverly Hills police lieutenant. The nursing care was stopped after the Beverly 
Hills Police Department switched health-care providers last year.

BUSINESS; NEW STORE OPENS SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's first multilevel Target store will open Sunday in the former 
Robinson's department store in Pasadena's Playhouse District. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota-based Target Stores expects more than 10,000 shoppers at the 
opening, which caps a $15-million renovation of the three-level building at 777 
E. Colorado Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Target, the first in Pasadena, has a shopping area of about 163,000 
square feet, compared with Target's average of 120,000 square feet. It is the 
second-largest store among 500 Targets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Target officials say they worked closely with city planners to maintain the 
character of the 1950s building. 
</P>
<P>
 A substantial portion of development funds were sunk into construction of 
eight large elevators. Six are designed to carry 16 customers and four shopping 
carts. Two are for cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Elevators also were installed in a three-level parking structure behind the 
building. 
</P>
<P>

EDUCATION; ASIAN AMERICANS CRITICIZE REJECTION OF UC REGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley's Asian American community has been up in arms over the 
state Senate's rejection of the first Chinese American to be nominated to the 
UC Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of 21 Asian American organizations gathered in Monterey Park 
last week to show support for Dr. Lester Lee, a Northern California businessman 
turned down for the post in a committee vote Feb. 24, and in a full Senate vote 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Tse of the Chinese American Education Assn. said Asian American 
students, who make up 24% of the University of California enrollment, need a 
voice among the regents. Some Asian Americans have complained they were 
rejected from UC schools even though they were qualified, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a Chinese immigrant, earned a doctorate in electrical engineering at 
Stanford and founded a company. He served on the board for 10 months before his 
confirmation vote. He was assailed by Democrats for supporting fee hikes and 
administrative pay raises.

PAYING HOMAGE; BEVERLY HILLS THEATER TROUPE TO STAGE PREMIERE OF MARK MEDOFF'S 
DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not every day that a small -- albeit well-respected -- local theater gets 
to stage the world premiere of a major playwright. But that's what's happening 
at Theatre 40 in Beverly Hills, where Mark Medoff's drama "The Homage That 
Follows" opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The connection is Theatre 40's acting artistic director, William Frankfather. 
Frankfather has known Medoff since 1966, when they were at New Mexico State 
University -- Frankfather as a graduate student, Medoff as a first-year teacher 
and aspiring novelist. Since then, Frankfather has appeared in several Medoff 
pieces, including the Mark Taper Forum's 1979 staging of his Tony Award-winning 
drama, "Children of a Lesser God." Medoff also wrote "When You Comin' Back, Red 
Ryder?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the five-character "Homage," Frankfather plays the supporting role of a 
defense attorney. "It has the dark Medoff character that keeps popping into all 
his plays," he said. "It's also a tough read -- as a lot of his plays are. 
There was only one director I could trust it with: Flora Plumb. And it even 
took her a few readings to get into it; the piece really only comes alive when 
you put it on its feet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Homage" takes place in New Mexico (Medoff's home turf) and centers on the 
emotional triangle of a middle-aged teacher, her actress daughter who's come 
home to visit and the young man who'd been hired to tend the mother's property 
-- and ends up murdering the daughter. "The play happens in a cracked time 
frame," explained Medoff, 54. "It begins with the young man in jail and then we 
relive the past." 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida-born playwright cites two impulses for his story line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I taught at New Mexico State University for 27 years," he said, "and in the 
'80s I became acutely aware of burnout. I didn't seem to have the same spirit I 
had when I was younger. I wanted to write about that. Then the brother of one 
of my students was brutally murdered. So this play was trying to deal with that 
experience of death and loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Married for 23 years and a father of three daughters (the eldest will make him 
a grandfather in June), Medoff said he liked the idea of treading on female 
turf. "I'd learned with 'Children' that I was able to write fairly decent 
female characters," said the playwright, who graduated from the University of 
Miami and Stanford University. "And living with so many women, I've become 
fairly feminized. I wanted to write a play with females at the center." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Medoff also works in film: His screenplays include "Clara's Heart," with 
Whoopi Goldberg, and "City of Joy," with Patrick Swayze. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done seven movies and written three times that many that didn't get 
made," he said dryly. "When I first started writing movies, I thought of it as 
a form of prostitution. I just wanted to make as much money as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Medoff, who headed the theater arts department at New Mexico State from 1978 
to 1989, is the school's dramatist-in-residence and a professor emeritus. 
Although formally retired from teaching, he's loath to give it up completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, I love working with kids -- but I hate traveling," he said. "The 
rule in our house is that if I'm gone longer than 10 days, everyone comes 
along. So it can get inconvenient. But I really like going out three or four 
times a year, doing a five-day workshop with public school kids." 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since the mega-success of "Children," Medoff has had time to come 
to grips with fame -- and the accompanying expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "First 'Red Ryder,' then 'Children,' were benedictions and curses," he said. 
"When 'Red Ryder' struck in '73, I was in my 30s -- and I felt very strongly 
that I had to replicate this experience. Then 'Children' came along. You'd 
think a person would say, 'I've got to do this every time,' but that didn't 
happen to me. Of course, you want the public and critics to come to everything; 
you want everything to have success. But I realized I couldn't measure what I 
did by financial success or public recognition. I can only do the best I can do 
-- every time." 
</P>
<P>
 A special performance of the play is scheduled today to benefit Homestead 
Hospice & Shelter, a local program providing care to people with AIDS.

TRANSPORTATION; PROJECT TO EASE TRAFFIC IN POMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A traffic synchronization project aims to put more green lights in front of 
drivers along two major east-west thoroughfares in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year project encompasses nine miles and 30 traffic signal lights at 
intersections along Holt Avenue between Union Avenue and Mills Avenue, and 
along Mission Boulevard between Phillips Drive and East End Avenue.Both streets 
are major arteries from the Orange (57), Pomona (60) and San Bernardino (10) 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by a combination of $50,000 from the city and $150,000 from the 
California Energy Commission, the project calls for each intersection's traffic 
signal to be automatically reset -- via microwave radio frequency signals -- in 
unison at least once daily, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, computer-aided equipment uses sensors to adjust the signals as the 
volume and predominant flow of traffic changes during the day. For instance, 
green lights at left-turn lanes will last longer when cars get backed up during 
the morning or evening commute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pomona traffic signal project is part of a countywide program initiated in 
1988.

HEALTH; CITY OF HOPE LAYS OFF 60 EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest sign of trouble for local health-care providers, City of Hope 
National Medical Center in Duarte has laid off about 60 employees, making it 
the fourth San Gabriel Valley hospital to cut staff within the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's layoffs include about 40 nurses and 20 other employees from the 
cancer hospital's 2,000-member staff, said hospital spokeswoman Lynne Doll. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials made the cutbacks in response to greater numbers of empty 
beds, since patients have shorter hospital stays than they used to, Doll said. 
She declined to provide specific numbers on the drop or on how much money the 
layoffs would save the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to get to the point where our staffing levels were consistent (with 
the patient census)," she said. "City of Hope has a reputation for providing 
state-of-the-art service to our patients, and that will absolutely continue." 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokeswoman for the California Nurses Assn., which represents the 
hospital's 480 registered nurses, questioned the necessity for layoffs, 
pointing out that City of Hope officials are not providing budget figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very interested in seeing how this affects patient care; we're very 
concerned about it," said association spokeswoman Pat McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, three other valley hospitals announced cutbacks, citing a drop in 
business. Inter-Community Medical Center in Covina trimmed 50 full-time 
positions from its 1,100-member staff through a voluntary separation package 
and then later cut an additional 29 full- and part-time positions; San Gabriel 
Valley Medical Center in San Gabriel laid off 51 employees from its 881-member 
staff, and Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena provided early retirement 
packages for 72 of its 3,300 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Other signs of weakness in the valley's health care market can be seen in a 
proposed merger, announced last month, between Inter-Community and West 
Covina's Queen of the Valley Hospital; and an affiliation agreement in 1992 
between Huntington Memorial in Pasadena and Methodist Hospital of Southern 
California in Arcadia to share some business functions, such as purchasing and 
contracting. 
</P>
<P>
 The valley's health-care providers are feeling the pinch of a prolonged slump 
among hospitals in Southern California, which are trying to cope with fierce 
competition, Medicare reimbursement cuts and the recession.

CRIME; MAN KILLS HIMSELF AFTER STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A West Covina man armed with a semiautomatic pistol fatally shot himself in 
the head after being wounded during a confrontation with a Covina police 
officer Tuesday morning, according to police and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man, Charles Edmond Blackburn, 31, was described as a paranoid 
schizophrenic who had been picked up by police before. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident Tuesday began about 11 a.m. when three Covina High School 
students saw a gunman firing shots into the air near the school's athletic 
fields. School officials said Blackburn did not go on campus or fire at 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes later, Covina officer David Povero spotted a man fitting the 
gunman's description several blocks away, just over the city limits on 
Fleetwell Avenue in West Covina. According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, which investigated the shooting, Povero got out of his patrol car 
and ordered Blackburn to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blackburn pointed his weapon at the officer, who then shot the suspect in 
the right leg near his hip, sheriff's spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Sheriff's Department and a witness who works nearby, Povero's 
pistol jammed and he scurried behind his patrol car for cover. At that point, 
Blackburn first pointed his Colt .45 to his own head, then at the officer, who 
was trying to fix his weapon, before pointing the gun again to his head and 
shooting himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackburn was pronounced dead at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina 
about 11:30 a.m. Covina police said this was Povero's first shooting incident 
during his four years on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackburn's family told the Sheriff's Department that he had been under 
psychiatric care for paranoid schizophrenia. West Covina police took Blackburn 
into custody for psychiatric observation twice in 1984 and again in July, 1987. 
Blackburn was also arrested in West Covina in 1982 on felony assault and 
weapons charges, police said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; HARMAN LAUNCHES REELECTION CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) formally launched her reelection bid last 
week, vowing to about 200 supporters that she would "keep coming through" to 
maintain aerospace jobs and defense contracts for her district. 
</P>
<P>
 She was joined at the Torrance Civic Center rally Friday by aerospace 
executives, union leaders, city officials and members of United We Stand, the 
grass-roots organization formed during Ross Perot's election bid. It was an 
attempt to show that she had bipartisan support in a district that is split 
almost evenly between Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, who spent $1.6 million on her successful 1992 bid to win the seat 
against Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, predicted the 1994 
campaign would be expensive as well. She already has almost $500,000 for the 
race (in 1992, Harman spent $823,000 of her own money in the race). 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks and former Palos Verdes Estates 
Councilman Ron Florance will face off in the Republican primary in June. Two 
other Republican candidates, Greg Cornell and Jerry Laws, have taken out 
nomination papers but have not returned them. The deadline is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A technicality has forced Rancho Palos Verdes psychiatrist Irwin Savodnik to 
drop out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 A statewide election code prohibits candidates from entering a party primary 
if they have switched parties in the past year, Savodnik said. He switched from 
Democrat to Republican last July. The code even bars him from running as an 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Savodnik had already spent $286,400 in personal funds on his campaign, making 
him No. 2 nationwide among those using their own money to win a seat in the 
House, according to the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance, a developer and investment banker, has spent $150,000 in personal 
funds, Roll Call reported, and Brooks, $13,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's opponents have attacked her vote for President Clinton's budget plan 
last year, saying that it showed she was willing to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But speaking to reporters before her rally, Harman predicted that an improved 
economy in the fall will show "that it proved to be a wise vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also have called Harman a "carpetbagger" for moving to the district 
shortly before the 1992 election race after years in Washington as an attorney 
and counsel in the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters didn't buy it last time, they won't buy it this time," she said, 
noting that she grew up in the Los Angeles area and maintained ties to her 
family here, even when she was in Washington. TED JOHNSON

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glen Cozart, a former deputy sheriff being prosecuted in Los Angeles Superior 
Court for planting false evidence and other criminal charges, unexpectedly 
changed his innocent plea Monday to no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The change of plea came in the midst of jury selection. Cozart, 32, could now 
receive up to four years in state prison when he returns to court April 11 for 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-year Sheriff's Department veteran and former field training officer at 
the Temple station, Cozart was charged with planting phony evidence, filing a 
false report and lying in court after he arrested three suspects in 1990 and 
discrepancies in his testimony caught the attention of court officials.

COMMUNITY NEWS: ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST; STRAY GUNFIRE PROMPTS CLOSURE OF 
PIGEON RIDGE SHOOTING AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Forest Service will close Pigeon Ridge Shooting Area by March 25, 
citing incidents of misdirected gunfire and wildfire sparked by ricocheting 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, a forest service employee was struck in the side by a stray 
bullet believed to be from Pigeon Ridge, said District Ranger Peggy 
Hernandez.The employee, who suffered a flesh wound, was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a Los Angeles County sheriff's car was hit by a stray bullet 
from the shooting area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, residents in the area have blamed their broken windows on gunfire from 
Pigeon Ridge, Hernandez said. And every year, at least two fires in the area 
are attributed to ricocheting bullets that ignite flammable material, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pigeon Ridge, about 15 miles from the San Gabriel Canyon entrance on Highway 
39, is not regularly staffed by forest service workers, and law enforcement 
officers do not regularly patrol the site.

<P>
 Imagine an animal that looks like a leopard but is the size of a domestic 
tabby. 
</P>
<P>
 It purrs and uses a litter box, but is swift and lithe like a wild animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the animal's temperament, it can display friendly curiosity or 
aloof grace. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, Jean Mill envisioned just such a creature. Determined to 
realize her dream, Mill bred a leopard cat -- a small, wild animal found in the 
jungles of Southeast Asia -- to domestic felines. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the results, which prowl and yowl in zoo-like habitats on her Covina 
acreage, are a new breed of cat called the Bengal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bengals weigh between 10 and 16 pounds and have silky pelts whose coloring 
ranges from black-on-orange leopard spots to swirled marbling. More rare are 
snow Bengals, which have ivory coloring with dark spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Mill said all the animals have black tail tips, get along well with other 
breeds of felis catus and are extremely active, with the quicksilver reflexes 
of their wild ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are majestic cats," she said. "They don't climb the drapes and get 
crazy, but they're very interested in what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the breed has been accepted by one of the major cat groups -- The 
International Cat Assn. -- which recognized the brown spotted Bengal three 
years ago and plans to recognize the snow leopard and marbled cats this May. 
</P>
<P>
 Other associations say that registration rules prohibit their accepting 
Bengals because the animals have wild blood and might retain aggressive 
impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, "They're delightful cats, absolutely gorgeous," said Wini Keuler, 
executive director of the American Cat Fanciers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wild look appeals to a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills plans to show off her cats when The International Cat Assn. hosts a show 
at the Masonic Lodge in Arcadia from April 29 to May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Owning such a creature doesn't come cheap. Mill's pedigreed purrers start at 
about $500 for pet-quality animals and reach $2,000 for show-quality animals, 
which must possess a variety of characteristics, including a sharply contrasted 
coat, small ears and a wide muzzle with large whisker pads. Additionally, the 
cats must be friendly to strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the steep prices, their popularity is such that Mill has a two-month 
waiting list, with customers flying in from as far away as Australia and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 A tall, gracious woman of 67, Mill has had many years to muse over what she 
has wrought and is adept at parrying criticism from animal rights activists who 
believe she should never have meddled with evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early on, I had a lot of opposition from purists who felt I was playing with 
Mother Nature," Mill said. "But I don't see it that way. A lot of people would 
like to have wild animals, but I don't believe they should be allowed to have 
lions and tigers in their homes, and I thought that if I could breed a cat that 
looked wild but acted domestic, that would be a happy solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Stewart, a professor of zoology at Cal Poly Pomona, said he sees nothing 
wrong with Mill's work if it doesn't lead to a wild species being depleted 
solely to breed pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something people have done for centuries, this is how we got a lot of 
our domestic animals -- by taking a wild animal into captivity and breeding it 
selectively," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dee, a big-cat expert at the Los Angeles Zoo, which has a leopard cat 
on display, said he doesn't think people should mix wild and domestic cats 
because no one knows what might eventually develop or where such 
experimentation will lead. However, he added that most wild tendencies are 
probably bred out of the animal after five generations. 
</P>
<P>
 And even in their natural habitat, the 10- to 16-pound leopard cats are more 
like 'fraidy cats than aggressors, Dee said. "It's not going to go attack 
someone, it's not in their nature. This is a cat that's relatively secretive." 
</P>
<P>
 Cats have been domesticated for millennia, and at times were worshiped as 
gods. Archeologists have found mummified Abyssinian cats in tombs alongside 
kings and queens of ancient Egypt. But cat experts say abandoned cats can turn 
feral within one generation and conversely, feral kittens can be tamed if 
raised by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mill's sprawling ranch house in the Covina hills, some cats roam in her 
wire-mesh enclosed front patio, trailed with ivy and carpeted perches where 
they can survey their world. Others live in 10-by-10-foot back-yard cages built 
around trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Each cage also contains a large exercise wheel that the cats use. Mill said 
she will occasionally find a severed possum head inside a cage, evidence that a 
young marsupial strayed too close for comfort the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
 Mill feeds her felines commercial cat food. She also worms the kittens and 
gives them inoculations and vitamins herself to keep down veterinary costs. And 
not every litter produces quality kittens. One group of tumbling youngsters in 
her back yard had the right spots but crooked tails. Mill said that because the 
cats are so unusual, even less-than-prize specimens will sell if she lowers the 
prices. She has placed others with friends and relatives and said she has never 
destroyed a cat or taken one to the pound. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifelong cat lover, Mill used to curl up around her favorite cat to take 
naps as a child. Her mother would then tiptoe in to pry the sleeping cat out of 
her daughter's arms, depositing it back in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Cats have also been her best teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They taught me most of my lessons, like how to survive the death of someone 
you love, how to work with something that's very independent and how much 
further you get by purring than scratching," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from Des Moines, Mill came to California to attend Pomona College 
and earned a degree in psychology. Later, she took several graduate classes in 
genetics at UC Davis. By 1948, Mill was already one of three breeders working 
unknown to one another to develop the Himalayan cat, a longhaired breed of 
mixed Persian and Siamese ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 Mill's strangest odyssey began in 1963, when she bought her first leopard cat. 
At the time, she and her first husband owned a cattle ranch in Yuma, Ariz. Mill 
soon realized that the wild cat was out of sorts away from its natural 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was lonely, so I put a black tomcat in there so she would have a little 
company," Mill recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Although people said it couldn't happen, the animals mated and a litter 
ensued. After that, "I thought, wouldn't it be nice to have (an offspring) 
that's friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 The genetic pioneer found that the first generation male offspring of an Asian 
leopard/domestic cat cross were sterile but that a few of the females were 
fertile. She continued breeding and, eventually, showing her new breed. 
</P>
<P>
 When her husband died in 1965, Mill had to give up the ranch and move into an 
apartment. Heartbroken, she gave the original wild leopard cat to a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 1975, when Mill married engineer Bob Mill, a dapper, genial 
man who favors bolo ties, that the cat lady of Covina was able to take up her 
vocation again. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mill had a one-acre horse property in the Covina hills planted with fig, 
grapefruit, apricot and orange trees. Soon, the Bengal habitats sprouted 
alongside the fruit trees and Jean Mill was happily at work again, researching 
bloodlines and plotting pedigrees. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, while in India, the Mills ran across a domestic street cat whose 
coloring and patterns came close to her ideal Bengal look. Piles of red tape 
later, the couple succeeded in importing the feline to the United States, where 
Mill mated it with the female Asian leopard cat hybrids she had acquired. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the difficulties in obtaining permits to keep exotic animals in 
California, Mill now keeps her leopard cats in Texas. She also said she doesn't 
use them for breeding anymore since the lines have progressed far enough for 
her to breed Bengal to Bengal. 
</P>
<P>
 Often she uses first-generation Bengals sired by the leopard cats. These 
felines, known as F1 -- the first filial generation -- are not very friendly to 
humans. They do not like to be held but will let Mill, who has raised them from 
birth, pet them briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 Their offspring, the F2s, are a bit more outgoing. And by the fourth and fifth 
generations, the spotted and marbled Bengals are purring and rubbing themselves 
against a visitor's legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Nochella, a New Yorker who bought a kitten from Mill last fall, is one 
satisfied customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an exceptional cat; he's very intelligent and responsive, he has a 
good temperament and he loves to be held," said Nochella, an associate art 
director at the Ronald Feldman Gallery in Manhattan. "He's changed my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of several hundred cats she has sold -- she declines to give precise 
numbers -- Mill said only two have been returned to her because of temperament 
problems. But she still smarts from an unfortunate incident three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, at an American Cat Fanciers Assn. show in Michigan, a Bengal bit a 
judge. The cats had just been recognized as a breed by the group two days 
before; after the show, the recognition was revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any breeder is going to have some cats that are going to be nasty," Mill 
said. "If a cat bites a judge at a cat show, the owner will make excuses like, 
'Oh, it's upset from being on the airplane.' But if a Bengal bites a judge, 
then it's: 'Oh-oh, it's wild.' We're trying so hard to improve our reputation 
and that . . . set us back 10 years at least." 
</P>
<P>
 A well-known judge of cat shows, who didn't want to be quoted by name because 
of catty politics, agreed with Mill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally love them. I have not had a moment's problem with the 30 or 40 
that I've handled at shows," the judge said. "But unfortunately, because of all 
the brouhaha, it will be a few years before they can be brought back" for 
admission to other cat associations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cat Fancier's Assn., the oldest and most conservative of the cat groups, 
concedes the group will probably be the last to register the Bengal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be they're very domesticated and there's not a temperament problem, 
but rumors of the (biting) incident spread far and wide and it made our 
breeders very uncomfortable," said Thomas H. Dent, executive director of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Often in the evenings, when she has completed making her cat rounds, Mill will 
bring one or two kittens in the house to play in her lap while the couple 
watches TV. But the husband of the woman who developed the striking breed of 
cat can't take much pleasure in his wife's hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's allergic to cats," Mill said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MALIBU; 6 CANDIDATES TARGET DEVELOPMENT ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six people are seeking two City Council seats in the April 12 election, with 
campaigns focusing on slowing development and streamlining City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The field includes incumbents Walt Keller, who is seeking another four-year 
term, and John Harlow, who was appointed to the council in 1992 to fill the 
unexpired term of resigning Mayor Larry Wan. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates have focused on keeping Malibu rural, preserving private property 
rights without harming the environment, expediting rebuilding in areas 
destroyed by the November firestorm, and developing a civic center development 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the candidates: 
</P>
<P>
 * Harlow, 63, is a retired division manager for Hughes Aircraft and has lived 
in the city for 33 years. He vows to streamline the city bureaucracy to enable 
homeowners to easily improve their property, cut city litigation costs through 
more arbitration and oppose government condemnation of properties affected by 
the fires and floods. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keller, 63, is a retired aerospace engineer and 33-year resident of the 
city. He promises to facilitate rebuilding of burned-out areas, adopt a General 
Plan that emphasizes slow growth, negotiate agreements with Caltrans to reduce 
traffic on Pacific Coast Highway and negotiate water delivery improvements with 
the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Hasse, 33, is a management analyst for the city of Los Angeles. Hasse, 
endorsed by Mayor Carolyn Van Horn and Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Kramer, has 
campaigned to elect council members Keller, Jeff Kramer, Joan House and Van 
Horn. Hasse promises to keep Malibu rural by establishing a land trust to buy 
property and "retire it" and to initiate a bond issue for the acquisition of 
land that would be left undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jeff Jennings, 50, is an attorney and 22-year resident. Jennings pledges to 
uphold strict development controls, expedite rebuilding for residents burned 
out of their homes and end council micro-management. 
</P>
<P>
 * Louis Ragsdale, 72, is a semi-retired real estate agent and a 36-year 
resident. He ran for City Council in 1964 when voters considered cityhood, but 
incorporation was rejected. Ragsdale promises to reduce litigation costs, 
maintain private property rights and fine-tune environmental protection 
regulations. He objects to a recently introduced ordinance that would require 
residents to sign liability waivers to receive permits to rebuild property lost 
to fires. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Stratman, 71, is a retired educator and a 24-year resident. Stratman 
promises to broaden the city's economic base by exploring the establishment of 
a think tank in the civic center area. He also supports slow growth. KATHLEEN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MAR VISTA; MAN'S DEATH IN JAIL WARD INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide detectives this week 
continued to investigate the death of a 41-year-old Mar Vista man in officers' 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bernard Wiley Jr. died at 8:46 p.m. Friday at County-USC Medical Center 
after a struggle with officers in the hospital's jail ward, Deputy Gabe Ramirez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrested Wiley at 4:38 p.m. Friday after responding to a report of a 
domestic dispute in the 12200 block of Pacific Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wiley was being restrained, a struggle ensued and a police officer was 
assaulted, Ramirez said. Wiley reportedly fell down a flight of stairs and 
received a cut on the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested and transported to the County-USC jail ward for treatment and 
booking. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley "became combative after his handcuffs were removed" at the hospital, 
Ramirez said. Several deputies and a Los Angeles Police Department officer were 
attempting to restrain him when he stopped breathing, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors could not revive Wiley, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Carrier, spokesman for the coroner's office, said an autopsy has been 
completed. The cause of death will be determined after toxicology results are 
received. ADRIAN MAHER

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SANTA MONICA: The City Council voted 6 to 1 on Tuesday to hold a referendum on 
the Santa Monica Civic Center expansion plan, placing the matter before voters 
on the June 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Kelly Olsen cast the dissenting vote. Opponents of the Civic Center 
redevelopment plan preferred the November ballot because more people vote in 
the general election than in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, however, said they wanted to resolve the issue quickly so 
they can place a bond measure for a new police station on the November ballot. 
They cannot do that until new zoning for the Civic Center area is established. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the election is $126,000, which includes sending voters a 128-page 
explanation of the complex plan complete with color renderings of the proposed 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES: The City Council has agreed to pay $900,000 to a Pacific 
Palisades woman who stood to lose her hillside home as a result of the improper 
construction of roads below. 
</P>
<P>
 The council already has settled lawsuits filed by other homeowners in the 
Porto Marina neighborhood. Last month, lawmakers voted to pay $2.5 million to 
two couples whose homes were destroyed in a 1993 landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury last year found the city and the California Department 
of Transportation liable for weakening the bluffs during construction of 
Pacific Coast Highway and other streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is helpless in this matter because of the city's approval of the 
(street construction) in 1926," said Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents 
Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude said the city never would have built some of the streets under today's 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the settlement for Josephine Hees. The Jan. 
17 earthquake rendered her ocean-view house uninhabitable, but the structure 
already was in danger of sliding off the hill, Braude maintained. MEETINGS NEXT

BAND POUNDS OUT TUNES ON OWN TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The four members of Claw Hammer freely admit they lack many of the 
accouterments that an aspiring, success-oriented alternative-rock band ought to 
have. They don't seem very concerned about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had a manager, never had a lawyer. We haven't toured enough. 
There's a lot of things we should have done that we didn't do," says co-founder 
Christopher Bagarozzi, breezily running down the checklist of rock-biz dos and 
don'ts Claw Hammer has managed to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to make tons of money," the burly guitarist said, "but for me the 
goal was to be in a band that I liked, and I didn't care if anybody else did. I 
wanted to please myself." 
</P>
<P>
 In its seven-year existence, even without the assistance of managers or 
lawyers, the Long Beach/Los Angeles band has managed to make a good deal of 
thoroughly wired, hard-edged music that weds a bluesy feel with a punk rock 
sense of abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The key feature of Claw Hammer's sound is the raucous yet honed guitar 
interplay between Bagarozzi and the band's other founder, Jon Wahl. Largely 
dispensing with the distortion and simple-mindedness of grunge-style guitar, 
Claw Hammer's albums feature two equal players riffing and soloing freely and 
simultaneously in a way that implies chaos yet adheres to well-conceived 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Claw Hammer guitarists are steeped in the underground rock tradition, 
citing as models such twin-guitar precursors as the MC5 and Television. At 
their sizzling best, abetted by the flexible bass-and-drums team of Rob Walther 
and Bob Lee, they can call to mind the thrust and probing spaciousness achieved 
by the Meat Puppets, whose Curt Kirkwood is one of the best guitarists to have 
come out of the indie-rock boom of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Wahl, who sings and writes the lyrics, tries to make up in maniacal impact 
what he lacks in melodiousness. His drawling and yelping echo and amplify the 
nasal style of Television alumni Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell, with some of 
the twisted blues phrasing of avant-rock hero Captain Beefheart thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 Beefheart's "Trout Mask Replica" album held a place of honor on the top of a 
stack of LPs in Wahl's Long Beach living room, where the members of Claw Hammer 
gathered for an interview. That's not surprising for a band that named itself 
after one of the album's tracks, "Orange Claw Hammer." 
</P>
<P>
 Claw Hammer started pounding late in 1986 after Bagarozzi answered a 
musician-wanted ad placed by Wahl. 
</P>
<P>
 A product of the fertile Fullerton-area punk rock scene, Wahl had attended 
Placentia High School, where classmate Mike Palm, leader of Agent Orange, sold 
him his first guitar and taught him how to play it. Wahl got some national 
exposure in 1985 when he joined the Pontiac Brothers and played on their 
acclaimed U.S. debut, "Doll Hut." But he quit the Pontiacs after nine months, 
despite their then-bright prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something weirder, something more like Claw Hammer is doing," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagarozzi was living in El Toro at the time, taking film classes at Cal State 
Long Beach and getting frustrated over his inability to find a band he liked 
playing in. When he saw the influences listed in Wahl's ad -- the MC5, Mott the 
Hoople, the Stooges and the Replacements -- he answered it and got the job, 
even though the ad sought a piano player, not a guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 Walther joined the band on bass in 1987, after Claw Hammer had debuted with 
singles for Trigon Records, a label owned by Wahl's brother. Lee signed on in 
1990 after the band had recorded its first album. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were never serious at first," Bagarozzi recalled. "I never thought we'd 
put a record out. I thought we'd just play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Claw Hammer began to gain fans. One was Long Gone John, owner of the Long 
Beach-based independent label Sympathy for the Record Industry, who underwrote 
the band's first three albums. Another was Brett Gurewitz, guitarist with the 
successful punk band Bad Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are my favorite band," Gurewitz said in a separate interview. "Their 
improvisational bits are absolutely genius, and they do it within the context 
of pop songwriting. I think that makes them a lot different and a lot greater 
than pretty much anything I've heard recently."

 COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach City College's bid for its first men's basketball title since 1976 
continues today when it competes in the quarterfinals of the community college 
state tournament at the UC Irvine Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (29-6) play perennial Northern California power West Valley (29-3) 
of Saratoga in the quarterfinals at 2 p.m. A win would advance Long Beach into 
Friday's semifinals against the winner of today's San Jose-Chaffey game. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach entered the state playoffs as the second-seeded team in Southern 
California behind Ventura (34-2), which is regarded as the tournament favorite. 
The Vikings advanced to the final eight with a 72-66 win over Saddleback on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach has been led by sophomore forward Kevin Beal, freshman forward Marc 
Neal and sophomore guard Marcus Rogers. Beal, the South Coast Conference's most 
valuable player, averages 22.2 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He became the school's career-scoring leader with 27 points in a victory over 
Southwest in the second round of the playoffs. He has 1,429 career points, 30 
more than Dick Markowitz scored for Long Beach in the 1957-58 and 1958-59 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, selected to the All-South Coast second team, is averaging 16.7 points, 
and Neal, a first-team selection, averages 15.3 points and a team-leading 8.1 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings displayed their depth against Saddleback, rallying from a 48-39 
deficit in the second half behind freshmen Pete Sverkos, Chris Blanton and 
Marcus Woods.

 Former Lynwood High basketball standouts LaTasha Burnett and JoAnne Williams 
played integral roles as Harbor College won its first state community college 
women's title last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett scored 98 points, had 39 rebounds and 26 assists in three games to 
spark the Seahawks. She had 28 points and 10 rebounds in the team's 83-70 win 
over Golden West in the championship game at Solano College in Suisun. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-5 sophomore, who was the state scoring leader with a 28-point 
average, was named most valuable player of the tournament and shared California 
community college player of the year honors with Iseth Cowan of Butte. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a 5-6 sophomore, led the way with 38 points in the title game and 
was named to the all-tournament and All-Southern California all-star teams. 
Harbor is coached by former Compton High player and coach Louie Nelson. LONG 
BEACH STATE 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State men's basketball team will be out to defend its Big West 
tournament title when it opens play against Pacific at 3 p.m. Friday at the 
Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (17-9, 11-7 in conference) are seeded third in the tournament and 
Pacific (16-13, 10-8) is sixth. Long Beach lost at Pacific, 92-69, in January 
and defeated the Tigers, 88-75, on Feb. 10 at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State (20-7) and Utah State (14-12) are seeded No. 1 and 2. Last 
season, the 49ers were seeded fourth but won the tournament to earn a berth in 
the 64-team NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers won their final two Big West road games last week, beating Cal State 
Fullerton, 96-87, and UC Irvine, 91-72. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach has been led by junior forward Mike Atkinson, who averages 15.6 
points and is the NCAA Division I leader in field-goal percentage at 69.2%. He 
is averaging a fraction more than senior swingman Rod Hannibal, who is also at 
15.6 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannibal needs 45 points in the tournament to become the 11th player in school 
history to reach the 1,000-point plateau. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others averaging in double figures for the 49ers are junior center 
Terrance O'Kelley at 12.1 points and a team-leading 6.8 rebounds and freshman 
swingman James Cotton at 11.4 points. O'Kelley scored a career-high 25 points 
in the team's loss to Pacific in January, and Cotton had a career-high 23 
points in the win over the Tigers in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers will play without starting point guard Jeff Rogers, who left the 
team for personal reasons after the team's win over Memphis State on Feb. 21. 
"Jeff is establishing new priorities in his life and has decided to focus on 
academics," Coach Seth Greenberg said. PREPS 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a good season for Southeast-Long Beach prep basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Six teams from the region reached the Southern Section finals in their 
divisions last week and four won titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the least surprising were the girls' titles won by Lynwood and Valley 
Christian, which won the same divisions last season. Lynwood won the Division 
I-AA championship with a 53-46 win over Peninsula and Valley Christian took the 
Division IV-A title for the third season in a row by defeating Village 
Christian, 79-64. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly's 71-60 win over Crescenta Valley in the boys' Division I-AA 
final also wasn't a major surprise, considering the Jackrabbits' past success. 
The only mild surprise was St. John Bosco's 55-54 win over highly regarded 
Dominguez in the boys' Division II-A championship for its first-ever Southern 
Section title. 
</P>
<P>
 But the teams could meet again in the Southern California Regional on Saturday 
at the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Dominguez, the only other region team to lose was the St. Paul 
boys' in the Division IV-AA final. The Swordsmen lost to Bassett, 77-73. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier High's Greg Ford was the only Southeast-Long Beach wrestler to win a 
title at the state high school championships at the University of Pacific in 
Stockton last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, who entered the meet as the top-ranked heavyweight in the state, won 
despite a lower-back injury that had forced him to forfeit his final match in 
the Southern Section Masters meet the previous week. He defeated San Diego 
Morse's David Gates, 5-3, in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other Southeast-Long Beach wrestler to place was Schurr's Jonathan 
DyReyes, who defeated James Logan's Paul Kanazeh, 4-2, in overtime, in the 
fifth-place 171-pound match. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two prep soccer teams nicknamed the Lancers had mixed results in the Southern 
Section championships at Gahr High last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens defeated Burbank Burroughs, 3-1, for the Division III boys' title 
and La Serna lost in overtime to Riverside Poly, 2-1, in the Division III 
girls' championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning its third title in school history, Bell Gardens finished 21-5-3. 
After a scoreless first half, the Lancers secured the win on goals by Gustavo 
Garita and Jamie Olivarez early in the second half. BRIEFLY

COVER STORY; A MOUNTAIN OF TEARS; NEITHER FIRES NOR FLOODS DAMPEN SPIRIT OF 
THOSE WHO WANT TO LIVE IN LAS FLORES -- AND NOWHERE ELSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Name a year and they can name a disaster. There was the 1970 wildfire. The 
1984 mudslides. The 1992 flood. And, worst of all, last November's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, residents of Malibu's Las Flores Canyon have managed to overcome 
what nature dished out. 
</P>
<P>
 They built retaining walls in the face of floods, planted vegetation to ward 
off landslides, cleared brush and installed sprinkler systems to protect their 
houses against fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that entire mountains have been denuded by the area's worst wildfire 
in memory, several hundred canyon residents have ever more reason to worry 
about floods, mudslides and debris flows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like living next to a time bomb," said Valerie Titus, who sleeps on the 
living room floor whenever it rains for fear the hillside behind her apartment 
will crash through the bedroom wall. Two years ago, she lived a few hundred 
yards up the canyon when a raging Las Flores Creek swept through her triplex 
and destroyed her possessions. Last month she lost her car in a mudslide. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, like many Las Flores residents, Titus has no desire to leave. "Even with 
all its troubles, this is a remarkably beautiful place to live," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A rugged gash on the coastal landscape, Las Flores Canyon stretches for more 
than a mile from north to south, hemmed by mountains on three sides and by the 
Pacific Ocean at its lower end. 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon's namesake creek, which once brimmed with salmon and steelhead 
trout, is a magnet for deer and other wildlife. Its shady glens and ocean 
vistas have made it popular with writers, artists and others looking for 
solitude. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a price: Calamity seems never far away. 
</P>
<P>
 This is by no means Malibu's only ecological trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1983 landslide at nearby Big Rock Mesa damaged or destroyed 240 homes, 
causing $97 million in damage. During heavy rains, muddy debris from eroding 
bluffs often force the closure of Pacific Coast Highway and inundate expensive 
beach houses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Las Flores Canyon's precarious geology, coupled with its popularity as a 
locale for million-dollar country homes, places it in a league of its own when 
it comes to natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lower canyon lies at the foot of a giant landslide, which in 1984 gobbled 
up eight hillside homes and wiped out half a mile of Rambla Pacifico Road, 
cutting off the only direct route to Pacific Coast Highway for 550 residents on 
the canyon's west rim. The slide changed the course of Las Flores Creek, 
shoving it 60 yards to the east. Engineers say the slide still poses a threat 
to the creek and to Las Flores Canyon Road, the only artery leading out of the 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on federal flood insurance maps, officials say 10 properties in the 
lower part of the canyon that were destroyed by the fire -- and at least eight 
that weren't -- are in an area likely to be severely flooded during prolonged 
torrential rains. 
</P>
<P>
 To the east, another 50 properties on Las Flores Mesa, whose residents must 
traverse the canyon to escape fire, are in danger of isolation if the canyon 
were to flood. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials are concerned that it will. Because of November's fires, soil 
experts say the area could face increased danger from floods and mudslides for 
the next eight years. It may take that long, they say, for the vegetation -- 
vital for absorbing and dispersing rain -- to regenerate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fire's aftermath, Malibu's elected officials have hurriedly begun 
seeking solutions to the hazards. And they hope to persuade the federal 
government to help foot the bill. Depending on what is attempted, costs could 
range from $8 million to tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort, moreover, is controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, including fire victims eager to rebuild in the canyon, heaped scorn 
on a study released this week that, among other things, suggested the part of 
the canyon in a flood plain be declared unsafe for habitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here because the canyon is a great place to live," said Susan Shaw, 
who, with her partner, lost a creek-side home to the fire and wants to rebuild. 
"We don't want to be told that our way of life is expendable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bad luck with the elements aside, Las Flores Canyon has had other troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep outsiders off his sprawling rancho that stretched along the entire 
Malibu coast, pioneer settler Frederick H. Rindge installed gates at the mouth 
of the canyon in 1894. Travelers between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara needed 
permission to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The gates were the focal point of a court battle between Rindge's widow and 
the state that lasted 22 years and was aimed at protecting Rancho Malibu as a 
private preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was slow to end, even after the U.S. Supreme Court granted the 
state an easement through the ranch to build what became Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1923, when state employees arrived to begin work on the road, they were met 
at Las Flores by 40 armed ranch guards who kept the workers off the property 
for three days. The highway finally opened in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon itself lies just outside the Rindge domain, a wild, out-of-the-way 
paradise that had been claimed early in the century by a group of well-to-do 
bankers, lawyers and businessmen -- many of them from Pasadena and Glendale -- 
known as the Uplifters.  
</P>
<P>
 The Uplifters were weekend warriors who built small cabins along the creek for 
their hunting and fishing expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War I, the group formed a trust that claimed title to much of the 
canyon. The road was brought up from the coast in the early 1920s, and the 
cabins were soon replaced with more luxurious timber lodges. 
</P>
<P>
 But the early settlers soon learned of the area's unforgiving environment. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1930s, the three dozen or so lodges that had been built there were 
gone -- lost to fire, flood and mudslides, said James J. C. Cartemanche, whose 
Uplifter grandfather and great-uncle were among Las Flores' original settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartemanche and his wife, Cornelia, can attest to the fragility of life in the 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 They live next door to his 81-year-old father on a narrow ridge top that had 
to be blasted with dynamite to make room for the two houses Cartemanche's 
ancestors built after starting to homestead there in 1908. Cartemanche's sister 
and brother-in-law, who lived in the gorge below him, lost their house during 
the November fire. The Cartemanches came within a whisker of losing theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you filled the train yard at Union Station with locomotives and revved up 
the engines, that's how the firestorm sounded when it came through," 
Cartemanche said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite officials' pleas that they evacuate, the couple rode out the fire with 
three U.S. Forestry Service firefighters who refused to leave them behind. 
</P>
<P>
 They lay next to a concrete wall and doused themselves with water from garbage 
cans to ward off the searing heat, then stamped out the embers that Cartemanche 
insists would have surely ignited the compound had they not been there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our entire family's history is here," he said. "We had too much of our lives 
invested, emotionally and otherwise, to consider leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 On Las Flores Mesa, where the fire destroyed all but a few of the 50 homes, 
including that of the late singer Roy Orbison, residents are no less determined 
to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best years of my life have been right here," said playwright Jerome 
Lawrence, 78, whose chalet, once a venue for literary conferences and 
playwriting workshops, burned to the ground. "I wouldn't think of leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his losses were signed first editions by friends Dorothy Parker and 
Tennessee Williams, an art collection that included a Picasso, two Degas, a 
Matisse and a Chagall, and the Steinway piano that Vladimir Horowitz played and 
Judy Garland leaned against while crooning at one of his parties. 
</P>
<P>
 A circular staircase modeled on the steps climbed by Angela Lansbury in the 
musical "Mame," written by Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, lay shriveled in what 
was once his living room. He plans to incorporate the staircase as a poolside 
ornament when he rebuilds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who say they may go elsewhere admit to a difficult choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to weigh my love for this place against the dangers of living here," 
said Cynthia Salisbury, who has lost two Las Flores Mesa homes to fire in her 
16 years there. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Salisbury and her two adult children were forced to flee on foot 
down a steep hill to the coast highway, where firefighters used ropes to pull 
them to safety just ahead of advancing flames. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As if it were nature's way of evening the score, fire damage inflicted on the 
hillsides now contributes to the misery of residents whose homes were spared 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the fire, Gary Silverston paid the owner of a speed boat $100 to 
take him from Marina del Rey to Las Flores, knowing that Pacific Coast Highway 
had been cordoned off. He swam ashore and ran a quarter of a mile to turn on 
the rooftop sprinkler system he believes saved his home. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite building his own retaining wall, a rainstorm last month sent mud 
and rock crashing into his daughter's bedroom and left 18 inches of debris in 
his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, when it rained we were high and dry," he said. "Now, we've got 12 1/2 
acres of hillside trying to come down on top of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Silverston's experience is the kind that worries local officials, who 
acknowledge that erosion control devices installed in the canyon since the fire 
would be inadequate in torrential rains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been fortunate so far," city engineer John P. Clement said, referring 
to the relatively dry winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is much debate about the canyon's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon residents, fearful of being forced to leave and others afraid they will 
not be allowed to rebuild, are upset with a suggestion by consultants that 
Malibu consider acquiring properties along the creek by condemnation, if 
necessary, as a way to reduce future risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea's supporters say acquisitions would not only remove residents from 
harm's way, but would allow the creek to be dredged, Las Flores Canyon Road to 
be raised safely above the flood plain and an earthen dam to be built to 
buttress the troublesome Rambla Pacifico slide. 
</P>
<P>
 If that were to happen, proponents say, it might even be possible to rebuild 
the part of Rambla Pacifico Road wiped out by the '84 slide. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has sharply divided property owners in the canyon and their 
neighbors on the west rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rambla people have wanted us out for years," said Shaw, the former 
creek-side resident who wants to rebuild. "They seem awfully eager to pick over 
our remains." 
</P>
<P>
 Rim residents offer another perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a one-of-a-kind chance to rebuild that road," said Dan Logan, whose 
group, Reopen Rambla, filed a lawsuit in 1989 blaming Los Angeles County for 
faulty construction and maintenance of the road and seeking to force the county 
to rebuild it. The county denied liability and said rebuilding the road would 
be too costly. The case is scheduled for trial in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the city of Malibu has managed to steer clear of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the residents' lawsuit and anxious to avoid assuming any liability 
of its own for repairing the slide, Malibu used an obscure law to exclude the 
road from its city limits when it incorporated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, with local officials eager to take advantage of Malibu having 
been declared a federal disaster area after the fire, the scenario for making 
the canyon safer has come to include possible solutions for the slide area. 
Malibu's City Council expects to settle on a plan possibly as early as next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers, including Madelyn Glickfeld, a member of the state Coastal 
Commission whose Las Flores home was destroyed by the fire, believe public 
acquisition of some properties in the canyon is inescapable to avoid further 
calamity in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that some people (in the canyon) still don't get it," Glickfeld 
said, referring to the potential danger. "Unless there's a will to mitigate the 
hazards properly, the worst may be still to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk is no comfort to Virginia Armstrong, 76, who for 30 years has 
operated the Malibu Carden School next to the creek in what was once an old 
firehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 From her office window, she sees a playground where Martin Sheen used to shoot 
hoops with sons Charlie and Emilio; a picket fence where Cary Grant often 
waited for his daughter in the afternoons, and the concrete slab where her own 
daughter, now 36, inscribed long ago: "Lani Was Here." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have former pupils who stop me in the market and say their years in the 
canyon were the happiest of their lives," Armstrong said. "We would surely hate 
to leave this place." On the Cover

<P>
 A view of Las Flores Canyon from the patio of a Deerpath Lane home destroyed 
in the November firestorm. Below is the crumbling hillside that resulted in the 
closing of Rambla Pacifico Road. Las Flores Canyon has been prone to fires, 
floods and mudslides. But residents, drawn to its quiet beauty, insist on 
remaining.

 Three years ago, Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell set up a fund and asked residents 
to donate money to benefit the homeless. Donations have amounted to $136,000, 
but only part of it has been spent. How should the money be allocated to do the 
most good? Ernie Kell 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Mayor We should stay with the dream we've been working on for about 
three years -- to bring all the agencies in the community together under one 
roof through a multi- 
</P>
<P>
 service center. When a homeless person comes in, we'll see if they are a 
veteran, if they are getting their veterans' benefits. If they are old enough 
to get Social Security, we'll make sure that they're getting Social Security. 
They can use the center's address, and we'll help them get a resume together, 
see if there's a job out there and that they apply. Since we don't have a 
location yet, we decided that $45,000 be spent to aid the homeless right now. 
Marc Coleman 
</P>
<P>
 President Long Beach Area Citizens Involved I would use that money to pay 
coordinators to form a consortium from existing service providers already tuned 
into the needs of the homeless and the available resources. We could assess 
each individual's situation and give the kind of personalized, custom treatment 
that the homeless veterans get two days a year in the Stand Down program. That 
money would be used to help coordinate volunteers and agencies and provide 
those resources 365 days a year so that all homeless get the same attention as 
veterans: medical treatment, job placement, mental and legal counseling and 
access to housing. Marshall Blesofsky 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Homeless Organizing Committee The main thing is just to keep most 
of that money together for the multi-service center and to make it a political 
reality. It's going to take a lot of money to get that going, and we need to 
take the initiative. The mayor should raise more money by going to his 
supporters in business groups instead of just putting little envelopes in 
utility bills. When the mayor ran for office he raised more than $500,000 -- 
more than the $136,000 he's raised for the homeless fund. I'm also leaning 
toward using some of this money toward an outreach worker for the mentally ill 
at an existing shelter. Cedric Hinson 
</P>
<P>
 Director  
</P>
<P>
 Christian Outreach Appeal I would help improve the financial resources of 
agencies that address the immediate and intermediate needs of the homeless. The 
immediate need of a person in a position like that would have to do with food 
and shelter, so agencies that provide that should get some of the money. Then I 
would look for which agencies are providing help after the shower and the meal. 
The ultimate end is not the Band-Aid fix. They need to find long-term housing 
and employment. There are homeless people out there who have worked and have 
job skills, at least enough to do janitorial work.

FAMILY OUTING; BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE POST OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So just how does that skinny little envelope with your child's birthday card 
(or your telephone bill), among millions of other skinny little envelopes, find 
its way to just the right place? 
</P>
<P>
 Your post office will be glad to show you and your family the whole works. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Bouffiou, communication program specialist with the U.S. Post Office, 
suggests that you start with your local post office, where you can see the 
letters picked up and sent to the processing plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The two processing plants in the San Gabriel Valley also offer tours, but most 
of the action there is in the evenings, when mail from the local offices is 
sorted and sent on to regional offices all over the country and to foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 At the processing plants, you can see the machines that read the addresses on 
some envelopes and sort them automatically. Other letters go through a sorter 
machine. A worker will look at the ZIP code and key it into the machine, which 
sorts the letter into a pile going to the same place. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize the average piece of mail, from when you drop it in the 
mailbox to delivery, will be handled 20-plus times," Bouffiou said. 
</P>
<P>
 To arrange a tour of your local office, call the postmaster. To tour a 
processing plant, call Bouffiou. 
</P>
<P>
 Families with children younger than 6 should not plan on going to a processing 
plant in the evening. "It wouldn't be appropriate for safety reasons," Bouffiou 
said. "During the day, it wouldn't be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Tours are scheduled on weekdays, and they are free. "It's not quite like 
Disneyland," Bouffiou said. "It's not nearly as exciting, and we don't let you 
ride on any of the equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is an education. The Details 
</P>
<P>
 What: Tours of postal facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Local post offices are everywhere. Nearby processing plants are at 
15421 Gale Ave., City of Industry, and 600 Lincoln Ave., Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Monday through Friday. There's more going on at a processing plant in 
the evening, but that time is not recommended for children younger than 6. 
</P>
<P>
 How much: Free. 
</P>
<P>
 More info: To tour a local office, call the postmaster. To tour a processing 
plant, call Terri Bouffiou, (213) 586-1717.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY; A PRONOUNCED DIFFERENCE IN REAL TEX-MEX CUISINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many local folks couldn't even pronounce the word "fajita" in the mid-1980s, 
when Nick and Pat Martinez moved from a ranch in the Lone Star State to a very 
similar place -- the hot, dry flatlands of Covina -- to open their Taste of 
Texas restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 And although fajita is now a household word, the couple says, it's still tough 
to find the tender beef of true fajitas, which they say were invented by 
Mexican ranch hands in Texas who wanted to make the most of the less desirable 
cuts from inside the rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepared in true Texas fashion, Nick Martinez says, the otherwise-tough beef 
used in true fajitas is marinated for a couple of days to tenderize it before 
it is mesquite-cooked and rolled up inside a fresh flour tortilla. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it's done daily at Taste of Texas, where you won't find any 
wimpy fajitas made of shrimp, chicken or vegetables. Everything on the menu is 
authentic Tex-Mex, the owners say, from the fresh flour or red (corn) tortillas 
to the brisket and ribs. And those are big ribs, mind you, not lil' ol' 
baby-backs. Every table has a roll of paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 So, does all that beef and pork on the menu add up to a cholesterol nightmare? 
</P>
<P>
 You kiddin'? says Nick, a big man with a gruff voice. "My mother was a 
dietitian." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he serves only lean cuts, grills the beef and doesn't use lard in the 
tortillas or beans. Many of his meals are broiled over mesquite, though some 
are fried. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the business is takeout. But those who stay to eat at a wooden booth 
or table can gaze at dozens of worn T-shirts, baseball caps, celebrity 
photographs, beer cans (only ones you'd find in Texas, of course) and worn 
athletic shoes that adorn the restaurant's ceiling and walls. Indoor seats and 
benches along an outside patio area accommodate about 130. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nick says proud Texas-native patrons -- especially the ones who show up Sunday 
mornings after church -- have donated many of the T-shirts, all of which are 
pinned flat against the ceiling and relate somehow to a Texas town, school, 
sports team or Texan philosophy. One shirt reads, "If you lead a good life, say 
your prayers and go to church, when you die you will go to Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular dishes is the $19.50 "Family Order" of fajitas, with a 
pound of beef strips that sizzle noisily on their way to the table, plus 
sauteed onions, a quart of boracho or "drunken" beans (cooked in beer), Spanish 
rice, salsa served in Mason jars and a dozen tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 For lunch: beef, chicken, pork and cheese tacos run between $1.75 and $2.35. 
House specials, such as pork ribs and breast of chicken with all of the 
"fixins" (beans, rice, salad and flour tortillas) are $6.95. Tex-Mex breakfast 
plates are $4.95. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taste of Texas is at 301 N. Azusa Ave. Hours are 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday 
through Friday (open to 10 p.m. Friday); 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday, and 
8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. Closed Monday.

EDUCATION / MARY LAINE YARBER: MAKING THE MOST OF AT-HOME LEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm delighted that parents are increasingly helping their children read by 
working with them at home. Unfortunately, some parents think such efforts 
require special training or pricey equipment. With some easy tips, your at-home 
reading and other learning activities can be simple, successful, even 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 First, designate a block of time that you and your child can count on fairly 
regularly. Thirty minutes several times a week should suffice. Longer sessions 
can cause the child to become bored. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure the "appointment" allows the child some breathing time. At the end 
of my school day, for example, I need a peaceful drive with the top down to 
prepare for the writing I'll do at home later. In the same way, your child 
needs to "recover" from school before starting your study session. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining a regular place for the child's learning is also wise. If space 
permits, set up a small desk and chair (along with supplies and books) to which 
the child may retreat. If that's not feasible, at least put the child's 
supplies and books in an accessible box or basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Even toddlers can detect a routine and become bored quickly, so use a variety 
of learning activities and change their order often. Let the child choose at 
least one of the day's activities. Young children are particularly stimulated 
by color and other visual cues; using colored pens, crayons, and other supplies 
are a good way to keep their interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is more encouraging than having a gang of people rooting for your 
success, so involve as many family members in the home learning activities as 
possible. I believe that this kind of nurturing can also keep children away 
from drugs and crime later in life. 
</P>
<P>
 As you and others work with the child, it is crucial to recognize correct 
answers with some physical contact and a specific comment such as, "You sounded 
out that word very quickly, Willis," or "Yes, April, full is the opposite of 
empty." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When a wrong answers pops up, give the child time to catch it before doing so 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, let at-home learning activities be followed by recreational time. 
Kids are generally more enthusiastic about serious activities when they know 
they'll still be permitted to take part in lighter ones later. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if you're at a loss about what kinds of activities to explore with 
your child, ask his or her teacher. Visiting the stores where teachers buy 
their materials may help, too; my favorite for variety and quality is Lakeshore 
Curriculum Materials Co., 8888 Venice Blvd., Culver City.

COMMUTING: TRAFFIC FLOW INTERFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With regard to the detours around the 10 Freeway, I am upset by seemingly 
pointless and often dangerous interference with traffic by police traffic 
officers. The worst is the intersection of National at Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 I commute from Palms, along Palms Boulevard to National, National to La Brea, 
to the freeway east to work, and back the same way. On the return trip, with no 
officers messing up the flow, it takes five minutes to proceed from La Cienega 
to Washington, another five minutes to get up to Robertson and proceed west to 
Overland. When the officers are on duty, there is gridlock from Hayden to 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 The light changes at Washington over and over and nothing moves -- because the 
officers take our green light at Venice and use it to allow cars coming south 
to left-turn east on Venice. Going eastbound, sometimes the officers turn off 
the traffic light at La Cienega and Jefferson, allowing La Cienega traffic to 
flow for many minutes while we back up almost to the left-bending curve at 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't get so upset if it made any sense, but it doesn't. Also, I am 
handicapped by severe arthritis, and driving is very uncomfortable for me. 
Those 15 extra minutes wasted by these idiocies really hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course I've tried to ride-share, but no one who lives near me either in the 
1-800-746-RIDE or my company either works the same hours or will give up 
smoking while commuting, or is closer to my residence then three miles. For a 
30-minute commute it is crazy to waste another 15 minutes driving out of the 
way to pick up a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 If only those officers would stop interfering! When they aren't there 
everything moves -- all directions. The lunatics are running the asylum.

HOUSING: FAIRNESS OF RENT CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the tenant who complained that "to permit this pass-through (of 
repair costs to tenants) is to change for all time the face and character of 
Santa Monica" ("Quake Puts Dent in Rent Control," March 3), I say it's about 
time! 
</P>
<P>
 I've been a renter for 30 years in the L.A. area and have never been a 
landlord sympathizer.Owners of rent-controlled units in Santa Monica, however, 
I view quite differently. They are unfairly treated by the Santa Monica City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 How appalling that renters enjoying ocean view apartments at $350 per month 
think it is their God-given right. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time outsiders be allowed in -- those willing and able to pay rents at 
market value.

JOBS: THE IMPACT OF DAY LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The usual justification for allowing street-corner, illegal alien day laborers 
is that they take jobs Americans don't want ("Toil and Trouble," March 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the jobs now going to illegal aliens are the same jobs that put me 
through high school and college.I worked as a laborer, busboy, farm worker, and 
other low-paying positions, and I was happy to have them. These entry-level 
jobs are now filled by adult illegals who work for random wages below the 
American scale. By returning illegal aliens back to their own countries, we 
will make these jobs again available to our jobless, frustrated youth. A 
resurgence of jobs for American youth would also probably put an end to the 
idle street gangs.

EDUCATION: ETHNIC IMMERSION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Farragut Elementary School's Japanese immersion program is laudable 
for its goals and its unique enriching experience ("The Global Classroom," Feb. 
27), there are some education issues which should be examined. 
</P>
<P>
 Firstly, with California's disgraceful school funding record, the disparity 
between resources allocated to non-immersion and immersion classrooms is 
obvious (e.g., lower student-teacher ratios and use of classroom 
aides).Secondly, and with perhaps more serious consequences for the future, 
immersion classrooms may encourage a trend toward segregating schoolchildren by 
ethnic group. (Families of Japanese descent naturally find the Japanese 
immersion program attractive.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City Board of Education's recent decision to relocate both the 
Spanish and Japanese immersion programs to a separate facility will effectively 
isolate these kids. Why not Ukrainian, Hebrew and Korean immersion programs? 
Because, in the end, we will have negated one of public education's strongest 
assets -- the sharing of common experience by our richly diverse community of 
children.

REGIONAL REPORT; ELECTIONS; HARDISON VICTORIOUS IN CLOSE RACE FOR MAYOR OF 
TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Voters Tuesday elected Torrance Councilwoman Dee Hardison as the city's next 
mayor, picking the retiring mayor's chosen successor to fill the largely 
ceremonial post. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardison, 56, a program specialist with the Torrance Unified School District, 
squeaked by Councilman Bill Applegate, 50, the owner of a real estate 
consulting business. She won 51.2% of the vote to Applegate's 48.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Tuesday, Hardison will be sworn in to succeed Mayor Katy Geissert, who is 
retiring after eight years as mayor and 12 years as a council member. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been cautiously optimistic all along," Hardison said shortly after her 
victory Tuesday night at a campaign party at her southeast Torrance home. "I 
wasn't shocked at the results, but I knew it would be a tough race." 
</P>
<P>
 Three new council members also were elected to four-year terms, in one of the 
largest turnovers on the seven-member body in recent memory. Former Councilman 
Dan Walker, along with retired financial executive Marcia Cribbs and Gardena 
planning supervisor Jack Messerlian, each won seats. No incumbents were 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for city clerk, secretary Sue Herbers handily defeated Councilman 
Mark Wirth and lawyer Gary Spero. Herbers will succeed John A. Bramhall, who is 
retiring. City Treasurer Linda Barnett ran unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 At her party, Hardison shouted "Get the champagne out!" when the final results 
came in about 10:40 p.m. She wiped tears from her eyes as her victory sunk in. 
After thinking about the results for a few minutes she said to the people 
assembled in her living room "Why am I crying?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to toast you people because you're the ones that made this possible," 
she said as the crowd chanted "Dee, Dee, Dee." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardison had the support of council members George Nakano, Don Lee and Mark 
Wirth, as well as strong backing from Geissert.  
</P>
<P>
 "She's past her biggest hurdle -- that's getting elected," said Geissert, who 
gave Hardison a dozen pink roses at the victory party. "To me that's very 
gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women's political careers have strong similarities. Geissert and 
Hardison were the first and second women elected to the council, and will be 
the first and second women elected mayor.  
</P>
<P>
 Applegate had the backing of the Torrance Police Officers Assn. but didn't 
have support of any other council members. Since he was elected in 1978, he has 
sparred with fellow council members and Geissert, often over the performance of 
and benefits given to top city management. His campaign literature called him 
the "independent, common sense candidate," a contrast to Hardison's 
oft-repeated description that she is a consensus builder. 
</P>
<P>
 At a campaign party at Del Conte's restaurant Tuesday night, Applegate said he 
would not have done anything differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran an absolutely clean campaign, very positive," Applegate said at the 
party, where supporters had made him cakes congratulating him either on his 
victory or his retirement. "I ran the kind of campaign you need to run." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardison entered the race in late 1992 after Nakano, who was widely expected 
to run, decided to seek a state Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Applegate had about a year's head start in the campaign, and kept 
the upper hand in fund raising and spending. As of Feb. 19, he had $28,093 in 
cash and had spent $37,018 this year. Hardison had $21,625 in cash and spent 
$21,682 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the campaign three months ago, Hardison said she would rely on 
precinct walking, as she had in her successful campaigns for council in 1986 
and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really had to reach citywide," she said. "We did things the way we always 
did: We walked and talked to get the people out." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardison will have little chance for a honeymoon. The city, facing state 
funding cutbacks and declining tax and fee revenue, will have to make up for an 
estimated $3.6-million to $4.2-million shortfall in its 1994-95 budget, said 
City Manager LeRoy Jackson. He plans to submit the first of his recommendations 
on March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a deficit, and we need to go to the community immediately 
and ask them "If we need to cut things, where do you want to cut?' " Hardison 
said after her victory.  
</P>
<P>
 The budget crunch will make it difficult for Hardison to pursue several 
campaign ideas, including increased police visibility on the streets and 
expanding drug and gang intervention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hardison) put out all the fliers with all of her plans, 'the Hardison plan 
will do this, the Hardison plan will do that,' " Applegate said Tuesday night. 
"Whatever plans she has to do, it's up to her to get support and find the money 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardison acknowledged that cuts will have to be made somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to go out to the community and see what they see as the most 
important," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 She also will have to help bring Cribbs and Messerlian up-to-date on the 
city's budget woes and other pressing issues. (Walker had 14 years' experience 
on the council before stepping down in 1992.) Two other council members, Lee 
and Maureen O'Donnell, were elected only two years ago. To ease the transition, 
the city plans to spend March 29 in an orientation workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you're dealing with the toughest budget in a long time," Lee said. "There 
are a lot of issues that this council will have to come up to speed on."

 KO OF THE KING 
</P>
<P>
 Few expected 34-year-old boxer Mark Connolly of Culver City to last more than 
two professional fights. It was even more surprising to see Connolly knock out 
"The King." 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting against Paul (Elvis) Presley of Memphis, Tenn., in a four-round 
heavyweight bout Saturday during the reopening of the Grand Olympic Auditorium, 
Connolly won by technical knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly knocked Presley down with a hard right to the stomach in the second 
round. Connolly (4-0, two KOs) fought a swing bout before the Oscar De La Hoya 
and Jimmi Bredahl World Boxing Organization junior lightweight championship 
bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly, a 6-foot-6, 235-pound former basketball player, is the son of Olga 
and Harold Connolly, gold medalists in the discus and the hammer at the 1956 
Olympics. DEJA VU 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard High had a rally Tuesday to celebrate the Vikings' Southern 
Section Division IV-AA girls' basketball championship. For the second 
consecutive season, the Vikings beat Santa Ynez to win the title. This time the 
score was 52-39. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite leg cramps, Olympia Scott had 25 points and 32 rebounds to led the 
Vikings. It was her fifth consecutive game where she has had 30 or more 
rebounds. Marte Alexander had 15 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, The Times' 1993 Westside player of the year, has led the Vikings to 
three Southern Section titles in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Scott had 26 points, 21 rebounds and 10 blocked shots to lift the 
Vikings (26-5) to a 77-34 victory over Sierra of Fresno in a State Division IV 
game. They continue defense of their state title tonight by playing host to 
Village Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting all over again," St. Bernard Coach Lori Pawinski. "People 
assumed we were going to win and would have been disappointed if we hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the championship still feels great. We deserved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Stanford-bound Scott and Alexander graduate in June, the Vikings 
appear to have a strong lineup for next season. Among the top players returning 
are starting sophomore point guard Tracie Oaks, 6-foot-2 sophomore forward Joi 
Thomas and 5-10 freshman Tanda Williams. REPEATERS 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Hills High may be the first school to win Southern Section boys' 
basketball titles under two names. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins won their second consecutive title, beating Arroyo Grande Coastal 
Christian, 69-59, in the Southern Section Division V-A championship Friday 
night at Murphy High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins also won the title last season when the school was called Bel-Air 
Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Brummel scored 17 points to lead the Bruins. Westley Allen scored 15 
points, Bryan Sterling had 14 points, and (Chispa) Barahona had 14 points and 
eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had four rookies trying to mesh with three veterans," Pacific Hills Coach 
John Bobich said. "It took a while for the chemistry to develop, but the 
younger Bruins have improved to make valuable contribution to the 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 The rookies were sophomore point guard Barahona, junior guard Adam Feldman, 
freshman forward Danny Kohn and junior guard Pablo Sprynger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins beat to Fresno Riverdale, 65-50, in the Southern California 
Regional Tuesday night at Murphy. The winner plays North Hollywood Campbell 
Hall tonight at Occidental College. HONORS

 Westchester senior quarterback Seka Edwards was selected to the 1993 
All-Academic football team by the Los Angeles Football Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, a two-time Times' Westside offensive back of the year, has a 3.05 
grade-point average. The 6-1, 170-pound Edwards passed for 2,053 yards and 28 
touchdowns last season to help the Comets reach the City Section 4-A Division 
semifinals. He passed for 3,599 yards and 52 touchdowns in the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the only area player selected to the team.

SCOTT HARRIS: BARBIE'S PLAN TO BOOST L.A.: SEX AND DEATH; WHY DENY OUR IMAGE 
WHEN WE CAN EXPLOIT IT? YOU KNOW WHAT ELVIS' MANAGER SAID: 'THERE'S NO SUCH

 It's not every day Deputy Mayor Barbie has a birthday, and though I've always 
thought of her as ageless -- as beautiful today as when she first came off 
Mattel's assembly line -- the 35th seemed to hit her pretty hard. 
</P>
<P>
 We surprised the Deputy Mayor for Damage Control with a party Wednesday night 
in the back room at The Redwood. Alice the waitress, who's been hustling drinks 
longer than Barbie's been around, kept the booze flowing. One joker was wearing 
wingtips, a gray suit, a red necktie and a lampshade. It seems he was doing a 
bawdy imitation of the boss. "Privatize this!" he'd roar. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Riordan, you may recall, didn't find his Barbie at Toys R Us. Their 
relationship -- strictly professional, she assures me -- goes back to when he 
was restructuring Mattel Corp. Barbie came to the Riordan Administration as a 
quid pro quo.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbie was looking depressed. Her painted-on smile seemed a bit forced. She 
was standing on a table between a mai tai and margarita, a straw in each. 
Barbie is no lightweight. Even so, it looked like she might stumble head first 
into the guacamole. 
</P>
<P>
 Then suddenly her baby blues went from bleary to bright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got it!" she cried. "Eros and Thanatos! That's it! Eros and Thanatos!" 
</P>
<P>
 Say what? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex and death," she explained later. "Didn't you ever study Greek mythology? 
Ah, the seductive dance of Eros and Thanatos. We are thrilled by sex and the 
threat of death." 
</P>
<P>
 We were drinking coffee now. Barbie seemed perfectly sober. A little creepy, 
but sober. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eros and Thanatos will save Los Angeles!" she declared. Then Deputy Mayor 
Barbie explained: 
</P>
<P>
 That very day, the mayor had handed her a thankless task. How can we spruce up 
the city's image when "L. A.'s finest," playing hardball in their campaign for 
a raise, are threatening to produce a video warning tourists of the dangers of 
Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started mixing my drinks, the answer became clear. Hey, Miami was 
hurting before 'Miami Vice' came along. Think about it. All over the world 
people know L. A. from 'Lethal Weapon' and 'Terminator.' This is post-'Dragnet' 
L. A. Why fight it? Ever since Rodney King, L. A.'s been a regular on the 
nightly news. Riots. Fires. Earthquakes. Is that such a bad thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I said. It's terrible. It's awful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting!" she replied. "It's thrilling! We've got Hollywood glamour and 
drive-by danger. Sex and death! Eros and Thanatos!" 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbie . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Listen," she went on, "people flock to Universal Studios for 'Earthquake' and 
'Backdraft.' They get vicarious jollies at the shoot-'em-up stage shows. L. A. 
is the real thing -- the ultimate thrill ride!" There was no stopping her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Face it: That old 'laid-back and mellow' crap never did much for tourism. We 
need a new multimedia strategy. Why deny our image when we can exploit it? 
We'll get so many tourists the cops will get their raise! You know what Elvis' 
manager said: 'There's no such thing as bad publicity.' " 
</P>
<P>
 True. But look how Elvis ended up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't you just hear Randy Newman's 'I Love L.A.' as a soundtrack to a video 
of murder and mayhem?" she said. "And we'll need a slogan. . . Something like: 
'Los Angeles. We dare you. ' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," I ventured, "it's better than: 'Eros. Thanatos. Los Angeles. ' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was meant to be a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, that's not bad," Barbie said. "We could put that in the New Yorker." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She leaned down into her coffee cup and sipped. Looking up, her eyes sparkled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got just the spokesman!" she said gleefully. "Nicholson!" 
</P>
<P>
 Jack? Well, yes. He is very L. A. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd be perfect!" Barbie said. "Los Angeles is the only city in the world 
where a tourist might be lucky enough to have his windshield smashed by a major 
star wielding a 5-iron! 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine an ad with Jack on a fairway at Riviera, pulling a club out of his 
bag. . . . 'Los Angeles, ' he sneers. Then he swings. The ball soars. Flash 
through a series of L. A. images -- sex-and-death stuff. End with the ball 
burying itself in a humongous bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now cut to smilin' Jack: 'We dare you. ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Barbie was on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "And how about a film noir spot with Nicholson as 'Chinatown's Jake Gittes: 
'The City of Angels. It beats a knife up your nose.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It took awhile, but Deputy Mayor Barbie had won me over. There was just one 
problem, I told her. The taxpayers could never afford Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbie gave me a sly grin.  
</P>
<P>
 "The man is facing criminal charges," she said. "We'll work it into the plea 
bargain." 
</P>
<P>
 But would a judge agree to that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," Barbie said, "if this isn't community service, what is?" 
</P>

A DELICATE TUG OF WAR ON TRADE; JAPAN: SUPER 301 IS A FLEXIBLE WEAPON, BUT ITS 
PROCEDURES, ONCE INVOKED, ARE NOT, AND MAY HURT US IN THE END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES C. SNIPES, James C. Snipes, a partner in a Washington law firm, 
specializes in international intellectual-property matters and has practiced 
law in Japan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrives in Tokyo for meetings 
following the failure of the summit between President Clinton and Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the United States is in uncharted territory in its 
relations with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Japan experts caution that the United States has gone too far in 
insisting on numerical targets as a way of assuring progress toward reduction 
of the trade deficit between the two countries. They worry about the effect of 
the no-pulled-punches trade negotiations, particularly at a time when the 
Pacific Rim is fixated on North Korea's nuclear intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say that the United States must stay the course in its hard line. They 
and their supporters on Capitol Hill argue that the time has come to make Japan 
pay for its unwillingness to reduce the trade deficit by invoking the newly 
revived Super 301 provision and imposing stiff sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither approach gives adequate weight to the central fact of the current 
predicament. While Hosokawa offers the best hope in decades for reform of 
Japan's economy, reduction of Japan's trade surplus with the United States is 
not one of his top priorities. First on his list is reform of the political 
system, which is only indirectly related to economic issues. But another top 
priority, his struggle to reduce the power of Japan's bureaucrats, is of 
enormous significance to American businesses seeking to crack the Japanese 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are many explanations for the fact that Japan has unusually low 
levels of manufactured imports and intra-industry trade for an economy of its 
size, one of the most important is the pervasive extent of government 
regulation in Japan. The notion that foreign skis were kept out on the basis 
that "Japanese snow is different" is incredible to non-Japanese, but reflects 
the almost untrammeled discretion and authority of the central government 
bureaucracy. Much of that authority is exercised through confidential and 
"informal" administrative guidance, which is no less binding for its 
informality. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem that Hosokawa faces in his push for deregulation is a dearth of 
practical advice on the issue. There is not yet a Japanese equivalent of an 
American Enterprise Institute or Brookings, where academics and former 
officials churn out hard-headed policy advice. Instead, Hosokawa must rely on 
the bureaucrats, most of whom would be disinclined to help the prime minister 
deregulate even if they knew how. This is an area in which the United States 
has plenty of experience. In due course, the Japanese will informally seek our 
advice. We cannot force it upon them. In the meantime, Hosokawa must find his 
own way. 
</P>
<P>
 His path won't be easy. He has provoked the wrath not only of the bureaucrats, 
but of the other two groups that share the credit for much of Japan's postwar 
economic success -- politicians and business. His political reform proposals 
threatened the electoral prospects of many current members of the Diet, and he 
was forced to accept a severe compromise after his shaky coalition in the Diet 
failed to support him on the issue. Businesses that have prospered within the 
strictures of a highly regulated system also feel threatened by his reforms. A 
recent ill-considered proposal to increase Japan's consumption tax hurt 
Hosokawa with the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Hosokawa's grip on power is tenuous at best. He cannot afford to 
appear to surrender to U.S. trade demands and give his enemies at home another 
stick with which to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 Where, then, do we go from here? Must the United States back off and again 
settle for vague assurances of market reforms? Or should we keep swinging? 
</P>
<P>
 It would be counterproductive for the United States to abandon its insistence 
on verifiable measures of progress in the opening of Japan's markets. In view 
of the dismal results of past trade talks, and domestic political pressures, 
Clinton needs Japan to go at least that far. But it would be self-defeating for 
the United States to provoke a no-win confrontation with Hosokawa that wounds 
him politically. While many Japanese want a prime minister who will stand up to 
the United States, most would judge harshly one who could not forestall a 
public rift in relations. 
</P>
<P>
 What is required on the U.S. side is a measured application of pressure for 
reform in Japan. U.S. pressure applied at the right time can strengthen 
Hosokawa's hand in his dealings with his Cabinet and the bureaucracy, and allow 
him to play "good cop" to the U.S government's "bad cop." Pressure applied in a 
heavy-handed manner or at the wrong time can make it appear in Japan that 
Hosokawa is pursuing the U.S. agenda rather than his own, thereby crippling his 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The intricate timing required in this exercise calls into question the wisdom 
of invoking Super 301 against Japan, as it forces negotiations to conform to 
its timetable. The threat of invoking Super 301 is a flexible weapon; its 
procedures, once invoked, are less so. In its timing and tone, U.S. pressure 
needs to reflect a close reading of Japanese politics.  
</P>
<P>
 We need a nuanced policy toward Japan, but it remains to be seen whether we 
have the patience and fortitude to formulate and implement one. Hosokawa 
represents a historic opportunity for the United States in its dealings with 
Japan. If we miss this chance, we are unlikely to have as good an opportunity 
for years to come.

BIG WEST BASKETBALL / MEN'S TOURNAMENT; THIS NCAA BERTH IS UP FOR GRABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The basketball question of the week in this town might be: Who will represent 
the Big West in the NCAA tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps: it's: Is this parity or parody? 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Farrell, Big West commissioner, says every conference team has a new 
life going into the tournament. That used to mean they all had an equal 
opportunity to lose to Nevada Las Vegas. This season, even at home in the 
Thomas & Mack Center, the Rebels appear to be just another team in a mediocre 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shake 'em up and see what happens," Long Beach State Coach Seth Greenberg 
said. "The league has been so wacky. Look at all the upsets. Who knows who has 
an advantage? 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean people who thought before the season that San Jose State would have a 
chance to beat UNLV for a third time in one year are the same people who think 
I'll be growing hair on my head again." 
</P>
<P>
 Even New Mexico State, the conference's closest thing to a dominating team, is 
vulnerable. The Aggies, 20-7 overall and Big West champions with a 12-6 record, 
have lost four of the last five and might need to win the tournament to ensure 
a berth in the NCAA field of 64. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't make those decisions, but that's more than a remote possibility," 
Aggie Coach Neil McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The games will begin today at 1 p.m. when 10th-seeded UC Irvine meets No. 7 UC 
Santa Barbara. Eighth-seeded Cal State Fullerton plays No. 9 Nevada at 3. p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, No. 2 Utah State plays the winner of the Irvine-Santa Barbara game 
at 1 p.m., and No. 3 Long Beach State meets No. 6 Pacific at 3. No. 1 New 
Mexico State plays the winner of the Fullerton-Nevada game at 7 and No. 4 San 
Jose State plays No. 5 UNLV at 9.  
</P>
<P>
 Who's favored? Long Beach State, Utah State and San Jose State -- who finished 
in a three-way tie for second with 11-7 records -- enter the tournament with 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach won seven of its last nine games, Utah State seven of eight. And 
San Jose, the conference's only team with a winning road record (6-3), has won 
three in a row, including a final weekend of upset victories at Las Vegas and 
Las Cruces, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State's major problem appears to be free-throw shooting -- the 
Aggies missed 22 of 29 in the second half against San Jose on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may suspend practice and do nothing but shoot free throws," McCarthy said. 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels have the talent, and if they starting winning, the home crowd could 
become a factor.  
</P>
<P>
 But really, when coaches say "anybody could win," they actually mean it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the guys at the top might be pretty concerned with who comes out of 
(today's) games," said Rod Baker, UC Irvine coach. "Eight, nine and 10 have 
done pretty well against one and two." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the Big West's bottom four. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Santa Barbara swept Long Beach and Utah State and split with New Mexico 
State; Fullerton beat the Rebels at in Las Vegas. Nevada has victories over 
defeated UNLV, New Mexico State and Utah State, and last-place Irvine upset New 
Mexico State and Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
 It gets more bizarre. UNLV swept Long Beach. Long Beach swept San Jose State. 
San Jose swept UNLV. Pacific swept San Jose. And Utah State swept Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some teams have other teams' number," San Jose Coach Stan Morrison said. "I 
think it has less to do with coaching and more do to with the psychological 
makeup of players. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some really intriguing games that will be played."

NORTHRIDGE CAN'T STAND PROSPERITY; COLLEGE BASEBALL: GENEROUS MATADORS COMMIT 
FOUR ERRORS, TWICE BLOW THREE-RUN LEADS IN 8-6 LOSS TO CAL STATE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a giving mood, visiting Cal State Northridge twice blew three-run leads 
Wednesday night before falling to Cal State Los Angeles, 8-6, in a 
nonconference game at Reeder Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly the momentum-building tuneup the Matadors, who committed four 
errors, envisioned heading into Friday's Western Athletic Conference home 
opener against Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (9-10) won five out of six heading into the game and had leads of 
3-0 and 5-2, but went into hibernation when the evening air turned chilly. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the bats just plain froze. Northridge managed three singles over the 
last six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A., an NCAA Division II team that entered the game with a record 
of 6-15, trotted out a succession of pitchers that threw, in order: right, 
left, right, left, right. The Northridge bats dutifully marched into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Vargas was called on to relieve right-hander James Hines (0-1) in the 
sixth with Northridge holding a 5-4 lead and Cal State L.A. baserunners at 
second and third. Vargas was summoned after Hines had gone ahead of Fidencio 
Madero, 0-and-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas struck out Madero on his first pitch. But thereafter, it got ugly in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the inning was over, Vargas was called for two balks and unloaded two 
wild pitches. The Golden Eagles scored four times, despite only two hits. They 
also swiped two bases in the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The balks clearly rattled Vargas, a junior right-hander. Both scored runners 
from third. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The umpire) said I put my hand in my glove and took it out," Vargas said. "I 
don't know. I wasn't really concentrating on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first balk, I kind of lost control. I was angry, very angry. I 
didn't do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Heim, a right-hander, pitched two scoreless innings to earn the victory in 
relief. Right-hander David Soliz pitched a scoreless ninth to earn the save. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't begin in disappointing fashion. The Matadors scored in the first 
three innings, sparked by Eric Gillespie (three hits). 
</P>
<P>
 But each time it looked as though the Matadors were ready to deliver the 
haymaker, Cal State L.A. scrambled back and made it close. 
</P>
<P>
 With Northridge holding a 5-2 lead in the fourth, Hines jumped ahead of 
Randall Harris, 0-and-2, before walking him with one out. Jon Cornelius then 
whacked a pitch over the fence in left-center to bring CSLA to within 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A. scored two runs in the second to cut into a 3-0 lead as the 
Northridge defense wobbled badly. It started when Harris doubled to 
right-center with one out and Madero followed with a chopper down the line at 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Nelson made a backhand grab, but threw the ball away, Harris scoring and 
Madero taking second. It got even nastier when a roller to shortstop Chad 
Thornhill hit the lip of the infield and rolled up his arm for an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Hines then unloaded a wild pitch to allow Madero to score from third, cutting 
the lead to 3-2.

ROUNDUP; ZAMUDIO'S ERROR SPOILS HIS STRONG PITCHING PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joel Zamudio had only himself to blame for a wasted outing in Monroe High's 
2-1 San Fernando tournament loss to Thousand Oaks on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The senior right-hander struck out 13 and walked three while limiting the 
visiting Lancers (1-0) to two hits, and also went two for three at the plate, 
but his eighth-inning throwing error on Jason Earles' bunt allowed the winning 
run to score from second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe (0-2) had tied the score in the bottom of the seventh to send the game 
into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlerock 17, Paraclete 2 -- The Lobos pounded 18 hits in the nonleague game 
at Paraclete. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Silva went four for four with a three-run home run. Jorge Pacheco, who 
homered and tripled, was three for four. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas 9, Bell-Jeff 6 -- Designated hitter Sam Rutherford went two for 
three, driving in three runs and scoring twice for host Calabasas (2-0) in the 
nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
 David Quintero doubled twice for winless Bell-Jeff (0-3), and Jesse Llamas 
added a three-run homer in the fourth. The contest was called after six innings 
because of darkness. HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park 1, Hoover 0 -- Carolina Bernal pitched a two-hit shutout, 
striking out eight and walking two, leading the Panthers in a nonleague game at 
Hoover. Newbury Park (3-0) scored its run on an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark 12, Carpinteria 0 -- Mindy Penrod threw a one-hitter to lead the 
visiting Musketeers (2-0), striking out 13 and walking two. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Tracy Milburn was five for five with four RBIs, including two 
doubles.

 UC Irvine's bid to upset Hawaii in the quarterfinals of the Big West women's 
basketball tournament fell short in the final seconds and the Rainbows held on 
for an 85-82 victory at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 A turnover by Tamera Thomas with 27 seconds left and missed three-pointers by 
Michelle Kahler and Karie Yoshioka down the stretch cost the ninth-seeded 
Anteaters a shot a upsetting top-seeded Hawaii (24-3). 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (5-23) had two shots at tying it, but Kahler's three-pointer 
rattled in and out of the rim with five seconds left, and Yoshioka's 
three-pointer bounced off the rim with one second remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine had the ball and trailed, 82-80, with 27 seconds left, but Thomas 
passed the ball straight to Hawaii's Nani Crockett, who was fouled and hit both 
free throws to put the Rainbows ahead, 84-80. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that Tamera made that one pass," Irvine Coach Colleen 
Matsuhara said, "but I told her after the game that it didn't come down to just 
that one play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that it came down to whether or not we put in a couple of 
three-pointers at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Jinelle Williams, a former Brea-Olinda High standout, led Irvine with 
25 points, and Yoshioka added 15. MIKE REILLEY

 Ickes begins his 20th season as head coach of the Monarchs. Mater Dei will 
have a tough time winning consecutive league titles as it faces strong 
competition with its very young pitching staff. Harris is the only returning 
starter. After beginning last season at 4-0, Harris lost his remaining three 
games to finish 4-3. "If our pitching does well, we'll be OK," Ickes said. 
Starting shortstop Mattern is the "best player on the team," Ickes said. 
Mattern, a senior, was a first-team all-league selection and the Monarchs will 
look to him for leadership. Treanor also returns. He will be behind the plate 
and should also help the offense. The Monarchs, who ranked as high as No. 4 in 
the nation last season, are trying to win the Newport Elks tournament for the 
second year in a row.

<P>
 The Cougars, led by one of the league's best pitching staffs, should battle 
Dana Hills for the title. Left-hander Zamora, named the 35th best high school 
prospect by Baseball America, is arguably one of the best left-handers in the 
nation. He had 100 strikeouts last season with a 1.45 earned-run average. The 
6-3 senior batted .296 and has signed with UCLA. Newcomer Puffer will also be 
on the mound and Coach Zamora expects good things from him. Capistrano Valley 
is an experienced team, with 15 seniors and one junior. Last season, the 
Cougars finished tied for third and missed a spot in the playoffs, but Zamora 
expects better results this year: "So far I don't see any weaknesses. We've 
been together a long time and we play well together."

 The Chargers finished fifth in league last season but the returning seven 
lettermen, including six starters, will help them to be more competitive. "I 
feel better about this group," McCaffrey said. "We are more experienced and 
stronger this year." Returning starters Fullerton and LeFevers, each 
second-team all-league selections, are the strengths of the Chargers' lineup. 
Fullerton, a third-year starter in the outfield, hit .319 last season. 
LeFevers, a second-year starter at shortstop, hit .350. In a league dominated 
by pitchers, McCaffrey's main concern is his pitching staff. Hendrikx pitched 
38 innings last year and went 2-3. Deculis pitched only 12 innings and was 0-2. 
Saltarelli, who was out most of last season with an ankle injury, is the best 
athlete on the team and will move to the mound from the outfield. Capacete, a 
senior who hit .283 last season, will move from third base to second, and 
sophomore newcomer Smith, a transfer from Oklahoma, will take over at third. 
Steel, batting .373, converts to catcher from the outfield.

 In his 14th season at the helm, Canary hopes his team finishes atop the league 
standings this season after taking second in 1993; this should be the year the 
Dolphins can do it. They return six starters and have a promising bunch of 
newcomers. "We are a well-rounded club," Canary said. "Our pitching and defense 
are both strong and we run well." The Dolphins are led by Etherton, a senior 
who was All-Division I and a Times Orange County first-team selection last 
year. Etherton led the county in strikeouts with 102. He hit six home runs 
during the regular season. Maynard, a second-team all-league pick, will be 
behind the plate when he isn't on the mound. Although only a junior, he's a top 
Division I prospect. Toomey, a junior transfer from University, pitches right 
and will play in the outfield. "He's a great player and a good prospect also," 
Canary said. Richardson returns at shortstop. Whittaker, a second-team 
all-league selection, will be back at second base, and senior Ralph, also a 
second-team all-league pick, will return to center field.

OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Wren takes over the head coaching job, moving up from JV, and he has some big 
shoes to fill after Ron Drake's resignation at the end of last season. Drake 
was at Mission Viejo for 16 years and posted a 241-130 record. He led his teams 
to three 20-win seasons. The Diablos are in one of the best leagues in the 
county and they will struggle to repeat their third-place finish of last 
season. They return only seven players, four starters. Dorn and Kalklosh will 
need to step up and take over the leadership of this team. Marian, a freshman 
transfer from Mater Dei, will be missed by the Monarchs and the Diablos should 
be able to put him to use quickly on the mound and at first base. The Diablos 
are strong up the middle with Dorn, Reinhart and Higashi, but that won't be 
enough against powerhouses like Capistrano Valley and Dana Hills. The Diablos 
need time and some playing experience, which they will get fast once league 
play begins.

PREP BASEBALL '94: SOUTH COAST LEAGUE; DANA HILLS' ETHERTON UNCHANGED BY 
SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "He portrays the perfect baseball player. He is humble and lets his actions 
speak for themselves. He just goes out and plays the game." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way Seth Etherton describes his idol, Chicago Cub All-Star second 
baseman Ryne Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been around anyone who loves baseball like he does. He is very 
routine and his actions on the mound speak for themselves. He is a quiet and 
humble individual." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way Dana Hills Coach Bob Canary describes Etherton, his star 
right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 Etherton, 17, has accomplished a great deal at a young age, yet, like 
Sandberg, he remains unpretentious. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, at age 15, he played in the Mickey Mantle World Series in 
Waterbury, Conn., opening the series for the Norwalk Cardinals. In the series 
semifinals, Etherton, who was the series MVP, pitched a one-hitter against a 
strong team from Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season on the mound for the Dolphins, Etherton was 8-2. He led Orange 
County with 102 strikeouts in the regular season. His earned-run average was an 
impressive 1.44. As a designated hitter, he batted .306 and hit six home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball America recently ranked him the 28th-best high school prospect in the 
country and USC has offered a full scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Etherton's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all really nice, but I don't think about those things," he said. "I 
really thought I was rated too high." 
</P>
<P>
 Etherton's low-key attitude might come from his stable family environment. His 
father, Randy, is a mortgage banker. Laurie, his mother, does not work outside 
the home. He has three brothers and one sister, ranging from 2 to 21 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family has been with me the whole time," Etherton said. "They make things 
easier for me and they are totally supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 Etherton started playing baseball when he was 7. He took the mound for the 
first time at age 8, but never spent time practicing his pitching until he 
turned 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just go out and throw my games," Etherton said. "I tried to be the 
best, but I never spent extra time at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have to work. There is always someone better than me, so I have to work 
really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 His main pitching competitor in the league is Capistrano Valley's Pete Zamora. 
Last season Zamora, a left-hander, was right behind Etherton in every category. 
Zamora was 8-3 with a 1.45 ERA and struck out 100. He was ranked 35th by 
Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Pete is the second-best left-hander in the nation," Etherton said. 
"But he may be the best, because I haven't seen the kid from Florida (Doug 
Million from Sarasota High, Baseball America's No. 2 prospect) pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 When the two went head-to-head last season, it might have been the best 
pitching duel in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Etherton pitched a three-hitter with 14 strikeouts; Zamora gave up four hits 
and struck out 16. The Dolphins won, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 And though both are seniors, their confrontations might continue beyond high 
school. Zamora has signed with UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Etherton hasn't decided what he will do after high school, but college is a 
high priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love USC. Everything is great there, the coaches, the players and 
especially the spirit," Etherton said. "As far as the draft is concerned, we 
will just have to wait and see if I'm picked and how high." 
</P>
<P>
 Now his main concern is the Dana Hills baseball team. Winning the South Coast 
League title is his No. 1 goal, and doing well in the playoffs is No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone on this team has grown up together," Etherton said. "I think we can 
go all the way." 1993 IN REVIEW 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei won the South Coast League title with a 12-3 record, finished sixth 
in the Division I rankings and fourth in the Orange County polls. . . . None of 
the South Coast League's playoff representatives defeated their first 
opponents. The Monarchs faced Long Beach Wilson in the first round and lost, 
6-4. Dana Hills, which surprised a number of people with its second-place 
finish in a competitive league, was eliminated in Round 1 by Edison, 5-4. 
Mission Viejo drew a wild-card spot and the Diablos lost to Ocean View, 9-8. 
The Seahawks advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to top-seeded Crespi. 
. . . Capistrano Valley, which tied for third with Mission Viejo, missed a 
playoff berth based on head-to-head play. . . . El Toro finished one game 
behind Capistrano Valley, while San Clemente struggled under its first-year 
coach. . . . Mater Dei's Mike McDonald, a pitcher and first baseman, was named 
the league's most valuable player. He finished with an 8-1 record, a 1.88 
earned-run average and 52 strikeouts. . . . Brodie Lefevbre of Capistrano 
Valley led the league in hitting with a .414 average, and Mission Viejo's Todd 
Sands had league highs in runs batted in (32) and home runs (seven). Standings

 Exhibitions that enlist the aid of art in the service of explicating the sense 
of a city or locale are notoriously difficult to pull off. "Love in the Ruins: 
Art and the Inspiration of L.A." is but the latest casualty. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, which opened Friday at the Long Beach Museum of Art, is an ambitious 
effort to articulate a complex picture of Los Angeles through the work of 23 
artists. As its title (borrowed from novelist Walker Percy) wryly suggests, the 
dystopian aspects of the region's popular profile, rather than its sunnier 
mystique, have taken center stage of late, while hope springs eternal. Although 
not as aggressively as "Helter Skelter: L.A. Art in the '90s," the notorious 
1992 show at the Museum of Contemporary Art, "Love in the Ruins" means to 
suggest a cultural edginess. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the exhibition consists of work with a basis in photography or 
other forms of reproduction, such as printing or video, but it's not monolithic 
in its aim. Long Beach Museum Curator Noriko Gamblin is conscientious in 
acknowledging a broad range of viewpoints, while also managing a thumbnail 
sketch of 25 years of history. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1960s there's Edward Ruscha's wonderful fold-out book of deadpan 
photographs, which chronicle its descriptive title: "Every Building on the 
Sunset Strip," and Vija Celmins' 1968 graphite drawing "Untitled (Ocean)," 
which is both a bracing meditation on the surface of the ocean and a slyly 
poetic rumination on the artistic uses of the surface of a piece of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1970s and 1980s, Edward Kienholz is represented by an assemblage made 
from an automobile door, Robert Yarber by a personal apocalypse painted in the 
jittery colors of nighttime neon and Judy Fiskin by small-format photographs of 
the desert, sites in old Long Beach and dingbat apartment buildings throughout 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 John Divola's luxurious and well-known Ektacolor photographs of beautiful Zuma 
Beach seen through the window of a burned-out, graffiti-scarred house are here, 
as are Anthony Hernandez's less familiar Cibachrome pictures of trash-cluttered 
freeway underpasses, where the residue of homelessness lingers. Hernandez 
records marginal landscapes for marginalized people. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, though, this is a show of rather recent art, or of work by younger 
artists. Some, such as video-based installations by Eileen Cowin and by the 
team of Max Almy and Teri Yarbrow, as well as Russell Crotty's ballpoint-ink 
doodles of battleships, installed as wallpaper, were conceived expressly for 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable examples by such established figures as John Baldessari, Karen Carson, 
Larry Johnson and Lari Pittman cohabit with work by newly emergent artists. 
Steven Criqui's cheerfully spooky paintings, framed like diner decor, act as 
signs for abstract landscapes in an oddly compelling, thoroughly contemporary 
reworking of Arthur Dove. And Catherine Opie's intentionally old-fashioned 
Pictorialist style, used for lovely platinum-print photographs of swooping, 
soaring freeway overpasses, disconcertingly represents these famous symbols of 
L.A.'s promise of a golden future in a historicizing manner: Progressive 
optimism is deftly memorialized as a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Art always responds in at least a general way to the environment in which it 
is made, even if it doesn't happen to illustrate current events. The show's 
post-recession/riot/flood/fire/earthquake/mudslide motif isn't addressed with 
specificity. When a distinct sense of shift shows up, as in Opie's smart 
photographs or Criqui's charming paintings, it's more oblique: Her pictures, 
notably untitled, could just as easily be photographs of freeways in Texas, 
while his paintings are equally evocative of strip malls in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty with the show is that it makes you look at this work as if Los 
Angeles, as factual place or fictional idea, is these artists' exclusive focus, 
when it almost never is. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century the Impressionist embrace of landscape was unthinkable 
without the wholesale urbanization of the era, while the explosive drama of 
17th-Century Baroque art could not have occurred without a consolidation of 
power by the Catholic Church. Impressionism isn't just about Paris, however, 
and Baroque art isn't just about Rome. Nor is the Postmodern art in the Long 
Beach exhibition just about L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, "Love in the Ruins" encourages you to narrow your response to the 
art it offers. By contrast, the best exhibitions are those that are most 
expansive. The "ruins" of the title should be as suggestive of the rubble of a 
Modernist conception of the world, which is no longer tenable, as they are of a 
charred or shaken piece of real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the "love" part of the title, it's the show's strongest feature. What's 
encouraging about the exhibition is the Long Beach Museum's enthusiastic 
willingness to sift through generational layers of art produced in Southern 
California, without the overweening regard for safe celebrity that has come to 
characterize so many museum programs, here and elsewhere. Thematic exhibitions 
are rare in museums these days, while younger artists of evident promise are 
usually shut out. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, museums often seem woefully disengaged from the artistic communities in 
which they reside. "Love in the Ruins" happily tries to buck those tides. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the show does get tangled up in a confusion that is endemic to our 
conflicted time. For convincing works of art finally do not represent the 
culture from which they come, whether Los Angeles, Paris or Rome. Instead, art 
is what creates it.

COVER STORY; RAISING COMPTON'S BOTTOM LINE; NEW ADMINISTRATOR HAS A HISTORY OF 
TURNING SCORES -- AND HEADS 
</P>

<P>
 Jerome Harris, the new state-appointed administrator of the Compton Unified 
School District, scanned the angry crowd in the school board meeting hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the front row sat school board members who were doing a slow burn because 
the state has taken away their powers and given them to Harris. Behind them 
were parents frustrated over schools that are falling apart and employees 
bitter over layoffs and proposed pay cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing this sea of distrust was Harris, who four days earlier had been a 
college professor in Brooklyn. Now, at his first school board meeting, he was 
about to say something that was sure to make some people even angrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing to kids in this system is almost criminal," he said as the 
room grew quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an overhead projector, he displayed a graph that used several lines to 
represent student achievement in California. The lowest line showed student 
achievement in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to see because it's right on the bottom," said Harris, dressed 
immaculately in a charcoal suit, pressed white shirt and red bow tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris then projected graphs measuring student achievement in others ways, 
such as among black students and among Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's Compton. It's on the bottom," he said and then twice more. "It's on 
the bottom. It's on the bottom. . . There isn't nobody learning -- not much." 
</P>
<P>
 And the problem, he said, is with the adults, including those in the 
boardroom. To think otherwise would be to suggest that black children can't 
learn, that Latino children can't learn, that poor people can't learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you believe that, you shouldn't be in the room." 
</P>
<P>
 John Jerome Harris was not about to walk out of the room. When Harris is in 
charge, he says that all children will learn. And he doesn't particularly care 
what it takes or which adults he offends if they prove to be obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 For teachers, this has meant standing up to teach -- because Harris believes 
you can't be inspiring from a chair. Principals have had to tolerate impromptu, 
frequent visits from the top man. And school board members who hired Harris 
discovered an administrator who sometimes treated them like underlings. Such 
traits helped get Harris fired in Atlanta, and have earned him such labels as 
"arrogant" and "domineering." 
</P>
<P>
 But like him or not, Harris has done what some researchers say is virtually 
impossible. The 62-year-old school administrator has gone into urban school 
districts filled with poor, minority students and raised student scores on 
standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Improving those scores "is probably the toughest thing to do in education," 
said one researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 That track record helped persuade the California Department of Education that 
Harris was the man to turn around Compton Unified, a district of 27,300 
students where test scores are typically the worst in the state. The scores 
showed no improvement in the latest round of statewide tests, which were 
released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Unified came under state control last July, as a condition for 
granting the struggling school system an emergency loan. Initially, the state's 
main job was to restore the district's financial health, but the Legislature 
subsequently ordered officials to improve Compton's academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The state placed a retired superintendent in charge of the Compton schools 
while conducting a nationwide search for a long-term administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of criticizing the performance of Compton Unified, state education 
officials now are on the spot to show that they can do better. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Harris -- who took over as the long-term administrator last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brooklyn, Harris was superintendent of Community School District 13 from 
1974 to 1988, during which time its test scores rose from the bottom of the 
pack to the middle of the heap in the New York City school system. 
</P>
<P>
 Test scores also rose in Atlanta during Harris' two-year tenure as 
superintendent. They declined after he left in 1990 and became an education 
consultant in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Atlanta school board fired Harris just one month after the 
district trumpeted gains in student achievement.  
</P>
<P>
 "He treated school board members like they were his employees and some of them 
took exception to that," explained one Atlanta school official. Other critics 
said Harris ran the district like a virtual dictator and demanded too much from 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said he merely tried to change what needed changing.  
</P>
<P>
 The North Carolina native has an engaging, folksy style that is unusual in the 
profession of education, where administrators toss off mind-numbing jargon like 
it was a job requirement. But his smooth manner belies an uncompromising 
orneriness. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up we could blame 'the Man' and say that 'the Man' did 
this to us," Harris said after taking the Atlanta job. "Now we have black 
mayors, black superintendents and black school boards . . . but they have not 
made a difference, not in Chicago, Newark, Detroit, Cleveland, nor in Atlanta. 
I can no longer blame 'the Man.' In Atlanta, now I am 'the Man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His school district motto for 1989 in Atlanta was, "Turn up the heat." 
Teachers and administrators complained that at any moment Harris might show up 
in their offices and classrooms, looking over their shoulders, commenting on 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't like teachers being embarrassed," said Audrey Butts, president of 
the Atlanta Assn. of Educators. "You don't go into a teacher's classroom and 
tell them in front of their class that they're not doing right. It was terrible 
for morale." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris directed teachers to write their goals for every lesson on the board at 
the start of class, both to focus teachers' efforts and to let students know 
exactly what was expected of them.  
</P>
<P>
 "You write down on the board what you expect the child to be able to do after 
having sat in your class for 30 minutes," said Chicago public schools Supt. 
Argie Johnson, who worked for Harris in New York. "For example, students will 
be able to reassemble a torso of the human body with 90% accuracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and principals who consistently received poor marks faced dismissal. 
Harris would judge teachers by their ability to make their classes interesting 
and effective. Ultimately, he said he had no complaint with good teachers or 
those who were improving. Principals who could not get their teachers to 
perform found their own job security fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton, Harris already has given principals a three-page checklist for 
evaluating teachers. Is the teacher assigning homework? Can students summarize 
what they've learned at the end of the lesson? Does the teacher have weekly 
lesson plans?  
</P>
<P>
 Former Atlanta administrator Mae A. Kendall tells the story of a music 
coordinator who repeatedly resisted Harris' plans to expand and improve the 
music program. How could Harris expect so much when she didn't even have a 
computer to work with, the music coordinator complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris showed up unannounced at the coordinator's office several days later to 
deliver a computer workstation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sat down in her office and said: 'Now what is your excuse?' and she had 
none," Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Harris was a difficult personality to work with," said Emmett Johnson, 
president of the Atlanta Council of PTAs. "But I looked at what was being done 
and I could live with the personality.  
</P>
<P>
 "Many parents wish that they could get him back." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris still owns a house in Atlanta and considers the city his permanent 
home. But he is no stranger to Southern California. He worked from 1960 to 1970 
as a teacher and vice principal at Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles. He 
received his doctorate in education from the Claremont Graduate School in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 At his first Compton school board meeting, Harris stressed that trying hard, 
though commendable, would no longer be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 All that matters is results: higher test scores, lower dropout rates, more 
admissions to college. That attitude was something Harris first learned at 
home. His father was a college professor. His mother earned a master's degree 
and taught elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Force times distance equals work," the former science teacher reminded his 
audience. "If you push on it till you die and it doesn't move, then you haven't 
produced work. We haven't produced the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the students are down, we're down," he added. "They will do better when we 
do better." 
</P>
<P>
 The talk by Harris received mixed reviews. Some thought he delivered a needed, 
encouraging dose of reality. Others considered his words a slap at the 
district's parents and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see Dr. Harris working for the interests of African American and 
Latino students," said board member Amen Rahh, who has accused state and county 
officials of conspiring to rape the district of its financial resources. "The 
state of California hates African Americans and Latinos. I see him in the same 
light as the Uncle Toms throughout history, until he proves that he's not one." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalem Aquil, a longtime parent volunteer and district critic, was unmoved 
after hearing Harris address a community gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always say, 'I'm here for the kids,' " he said. "I could have written 
that speech for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Several days later, Harris was paying unannounced, spot visits to five schools 
with Acting Supt. Harold L. Cebrun, who works directly under Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men would check in briefly at the principal's office, then start 
roaming about. Principals at some schools were so edgy that they never let 
Harris and Cebrun out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 One assistant principal apologized profusely when the principal was not in the 
office to greet Harris. "She's walking the campus," he told Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best place for her," Harris replied.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to catch them doing wrong," he said later. "I'm trying to help 
them." Harris said the help will include extensive training for the staff 
already in place. "I try to grow my own professionals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Compton's Davis Middle School and other campuses, Harris casually 
introduced himself to administrators, teachers, cafeteria workers and children. 
And he directed Cebrun to take notes of their concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 A first-year teacher at Washington Elementary described how discouraged he was 
after his room had been broken into four times, twice within the previous week. 
Vandals had ransacked the class and covered it with graffiti. The teacher also 
showed Harris three leaks where rain runoff was coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris directed Cebrun to have someone see if the leaks could be repaired. 
"The man's a new teacher," Harris said. "It does his morale 118% of good if 
someone comes out and looks at the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 A cafeteria worker at another school complained about the dark eating area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet if you got up there and raised those blinds it wouldn't be so dark," he 
told her. "I don't know why they're closed." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe to hide the dirt on the windows," the worker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't hide the dirt," Harris said with a smile before moving on. 
</P>
<P>
 At Centennial High, he flagged down three late-arriving 11th-graders. "Do you 
think you're going to make 12th grade and graduate?" he asked.  
</P>
<P>
 They said they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't if you don't get to school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were silent, unsure if they were in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harris, not in the mood to pick a fight, waved them on. "Nice to meet you 
ladies. Glad you got this far." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who has six grown children, enjoys talking with students. It is for 
their sake, he said, that he postponed retirement, left his East Coast home and 
came to Southern California with his wife Earlene, a former school teacher and 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are my kids," he said. "This is my future. This is where the action 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 The state is expected to remain in charge of the Compton schools for at least 
three years -- until the district can make a financial and academic turnaround. 
Harris, who will earn $109,500 a year, has not said how long he plans to stay 
or exactly how he will change things. 
</P>
<P>
 At Brooklyn's School District 13, Harris set up academies in his middle 
schools with specialties such as math, journalism and art. All students applied 
to one or more academies and all were accepted into a program. The goal was to 
cultivate students' talents, increase their interest in school and provide more 
counseling for students and their families. In Atlanta, he put handpicked teams 
in charge of improving low-achieving schools and also organized parent and 
teacher task forces.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, while a professor at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, he 
headed a program to improve New York area school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But can Harris find the right remedy to help Compton? 
</P>
<P>
 The district, with an annual budget of about $92.4 million, is burdened with 
$20 million worth of debt from emergency state loans. The financial mire has 
resulted in disruptive layoffs and pay cuts that have plunged morale as low as 
Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, racially tinged brawls have broken out between Latino and African 
American students in the district, which is 59% Latino, 39% African American. 
About a third of district students speak limited English. At some campuses, 
nearly all children are on public assistance of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
 And the aging schools are falling apart, a process hastened by thieves, 
firebugs and graffiti vandals who have done millions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as disquieting is what occurred during Harris' recent visit to an 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth-grader on recess had stepped forward to help Harris find his way 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed out the principal's office and a boy she had taught how to do 
cartwheels. She warned Harris to be quiet as he went through one particular 
wing because teachers were giving tests. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the model of wit, charm and awareness until Harris asked her if she 
was as smart as a boy who had just answered a question in a class Harris was 
observing. 
</P>
<P>
 A cloud came over the girl's face. She explained that she was not as smart, 
that she was in a lower group. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris bristled, but kept his smile in place till he started walking back to 
his car. For him, that girl was an example of how Compton needed to change. 
That child was becoming a victim of a system that had too little hope for what 
she could do with her life. Schools must set higher standards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all that child has going for her, she's already conceded that she's in a 
lower group," he said quietly. "She's as smart as any child out here and as 
smart as anybody needs to be." 
</P>
<P>
 When he spoke to the restive crowd at the school board meeting, Harris also 
set a high standard for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't have better results in a year then I'll leave. Or you ought to 
have me leave." Record in Atlanta

District 13 held onto most of its gains.

AN OCEAN OF INFORMATION; 18 PANELS ON VENTURA PIER'S HISTORY AND ITS MARINE 
LIFE INSTALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since October, when the Ventura Pier reopened after a $3.5-million 
restoration, thousands of tourists and fishermen have flocked to the state's 
longest wooden pier to catch fish, feed birds and gaze at the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they will be able to read about what they've been seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers on Wednesday finished installing 18 porcelain enamel panels on the 
pier railings in preparation for a dedication ceremony Friday. Scattered along 
the length of the 1,958-foot-long pier, the panels depict images of local fish, 
birds, marine mammals and the history of the 122-year-old state landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the panels, adorned with photographs dating back to the 1800s, have 
been on the pier since October. Installation of the remaining dozen panels -- 
watercolors created by local artists -- had been delayed because the 
manufacturer made mistakes in duplicating the colors, said Johnji Stone, who 
coordinated the 18-month project for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased with how the panels turned out," she said. "These are not 
simply works of art, they also serve an educational purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the pier can learn about the feeding strategies of the Caspian 
tern, the least tern and the brown pelican. For those tourists who want to know 
about the most common kinds of fish caught off the pier, the white croaker, top 
smelt, jacksmelt and surfperch are depicted in another panel. Curious about 
sharks? The leopard shark, shorelnose, guitarfishes and thornbacks that swim in 
the area are highlighted in a panel. Want to find out how a wave is formed? 
There's a panel for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Grotenhuis, who is in charge of installing the panels, said city officials 
were concerned about how the panels would endure the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things are durable," said Grotenhuis as he attached a panel onto a wood 
railing. "You could throw these in the bottom of the sea and they would still 
last." 
</P>
<P>
 The panels, which cost a total of $40,000, are made of baked porcelain and are 
fused to molten glass and steel, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the most expensive kind, but they're the most durable and 
vandal-resistant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a drill and wrenches, Grotenhuis and worker Bernard Vazquez spent about 
four hours bolting the panels to the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 First they had to make sure the surface was flat and smooth, then they drilled 
holes into the Douglas fir railings and screwed four bolts per panel into the 
wood. In some cases, they had to pry out large bolts in the railing to make 
room for the panels, which measure 18 inches by 24 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone wanted to take these," Grotenhuis said, "they'd have to show up 
with tools."

 A fisherman who watched the workers put the finishing artistic touches on the 
pier said the panels are convenient for both tourists and regular visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," he said, peering at a panel that highlighted fish caught in 
the area. "Now maybe the tourists won't be asking so many questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Arrowsmith, a salesman for a plastics company, said he enjoyed reading 
the new panels during his lunch break Wednesday. It was the first walk down the 
pier for Arrowsmith, who carefully read the panels he encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put the pier in its place in history," Arrowsmith said. "Otherwise, 
you're just walking on a beautiful piece of wood."

OXNARD OKS LOW-INCOME APARTMENTS; REDEVELOPMENT: DESPITE CONCERNS FROM 
NEIGHBORS, CITY COUNCIL BACKS THE $5-MILLION, 32-UNIT HOUSING PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With time running out to replace housing demolished by redevelopment, the 
Oxnard City Council has approved a $5-million low-income housing project in the 
downtown area over the objections of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of plans by the nonprofit Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. of 
Saticoy to build 32 low-income apartments marks the first time since 1976 that 
the county's largest city has approved an apartment complex reserved 
exclusively for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's unanimous decision Tuesday to approve the Villa Solimar 
apartments followed four hours of conflicting and often emotional testimony 
from opponents and affordable-housing advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the council authorized Cabrillo to proceed with the project but 
added safeguards to minimize the effects on residents of the nearby Royal Palms 
Mobile Home Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to disrupt the lives of the neighbors, but we can't address 
their concerns by simply not building the project," Councilman Andres Herrera 
said. "We have an obligation to provide this kind of housing." 
</P>
<P>
 The project will be built on land purchased from the city's Redevelopment 
Agency. The city will also provide Cabrillo with more than $340,000 toward the 
cost of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state redevelopment law, Oxnard has four years to replace the 77 units 
of mostly low-income housing that it removed from the downtown area as part of 
its redevelopment strategy. Redevelopment Director Richard Maggio said Tuesday 
that the city has until the end of next year to meet the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials previously said state law allows them to count the Villa 
Solimar project as 96 units of replacement housing because all 32 units will be 
three-bedroom apartments, which will rent for $600 to $700 a month. State law 
requires 20% of the city's redevelopment funds to be spent on affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision to build the low-income project was anything but easy for the 
council, which was faced with vocal opposition from some Royal Palms residents 
and owners of the adjacent Regal Motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the park, separated by an alley from the 1.5-acre site at 
Driffill Boulevard and Donlon Avenue, said they feared potential noise and 
traffic congestion caused by Villa Solimar. Neighbors also expressed concern 
that children living at Villa Solimar would be in danger from traffic 
converging at Oxnard's busy Five Points intersection a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot regulate children," Glen Serres said. "I don't care how well they 
are supervised; they will be all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Royal Palms residents muttered at the sound of crying children who had 
been brought to the council chambers by low-income residents supporting the 
project. "That's what we'll hear all day and night," one audience member 
grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 To address concerns over noise, Cabrillo officials agreed to install 
double-pane windows, replace balcony railings with solid walls and reduce the 
number of windows that can open. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo officials also agreed to install security gates at the three 
entrances to Villa Solimar and equip the on-site manager with an 
around-the-clock pager to respond quickly to complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting the project at Tuesday's hearing were affordable-housing advocates 
and low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is in desperate need of low-income housing," said Eileen McCarthy, 
an attorney with California Rural Legal Assistance, a farm-worker support 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy cited the city's General Plan, which documents the need for 1,700 new 
low-income housing units in the current five-year period and calls for the 
construction of 850 such units. Of those, just 22 affordable units have been 
built in the past four years, city officials have conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara A. Journet, Cabrillo's community representative, appealed to the 
council to reverse the city's recent policy in support of higher-priced homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen years ago, the city made a conscious decision to stop building 
affordable homes," Journet said. "Now, we are asking you to make a conscious 
decision to support this project."

FIGHT AGAINST OJAI RADAR TOWER SHIFTS TO D.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The battle over Sulphur Mountain moved east Wednesday to Capitol Hill, as 
actor Larry Hagman and Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) braved a raw wind to 
excoriate the National Weather Service and its much-maligned Ojai radar tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman, an upper Ojai resident who has taken a prominent role in fighting the 
installation, fears the radiation it emits may be a health hazard to nearby 
homeowners, including himself and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The 98-foot-tall weather-tracking device, dubbed the "Black Orb" by angry Ojai 
Valley residents, was erected late last year with virtually no advance warning 
to elected officials and nearby homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 With Hagman back East researching the radiation issue, Gallegly arranged for 
the TV celebrity to schmooze with lawmakers and lure a few reporters to a 
frosty -- and brief -- outdoor press conference near the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman accused the Weather Service of "high-handed methods" in putting the 
radar dome on top of Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They snuck it in without consulting anyone in the local community," Hagman 
said. "They didn't ask my permission, nor the city, nor the county. They 
misrepresented themselves, lied, and they broke the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman, whose home is about 800 yards from the tower, also warned of possible 
health dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not been proven to anyone . . . that (the radiation) does not cause 
leukemia down the line," he said. "We're talking about something rather 
insidious -- you can't see it, smell it, taste it. It's not like a gunshot. 
It's just all-pervasive and our children are directly in line for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Weather Service officials have said their studies found minute levels of 
radiation that could not harm humans. The Weather Service said a microwave oven 
causes higher radiation levels. 
</P>
<P>
 With his environmentally sensitive Ojai Valley constituents up in arms, 
Gallegly recently introduced legislation to delay operation of the radar tower 
until a comprehensive study on possible health hazards is conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, he took a more cautious tone, focusing his attack more on 
governmental chutzpah.  
</P>
<P>
 "On the issue of procedure, it's unconscionable and that is justification 
enough to pull in the reins," he said. "I can't say (the Weather Service has) 
broken the law. The thing that gets so complicated is that the federal 
government doesn't have to play by the same laws that local, state and county 
government does. That in and of itself alienates the heck out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 On the health issue, Gallegly said he was troubled by the medical unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their so-called experts . . . couldn't give us the answer" about whether 
residents are safe, he said. "Asking for a comprehensive study before they 
activate it is a very reasonable approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly also tweaked the Weather Service for constructing the radar tower 
during the four-day Thanksgiving holiday last year, when many residents were 
out of town or caught up in holiday activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It probably cost a lot more money, so their agenda for doing it that weekend 
is suspect at least," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the press conference was Donald Mallonee of Sayville, N.Y., a Long 
Island community that successfully fought a similar Weather Service radar 
installation in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Given several months' warning of the planned radar installation, Mallonee 
said, the Sayville community persuaded the Weather Service to move the radar to 
a less populated area. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they've changed their tune now," Mallonee said. "Instead of coming in and 
asking, they're coming in and telling, and that's an atrocious way to treat the 
citizens of this great country of ours."  
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Weather Service office in Oxnard contend that the public was 
alerted to the Sulphur Mountain project as early as 1992 during a meeting of 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai tower is one of 165 being constructed nationwide as a part of a 
decade-long renovation project to improve the monitoring of thundershowers, 
wind currents and other atmospheric conditions. The new system is designed to 
replace an obsolete tower in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county and local officials have opposed the radar dome, a federal 
judge last month sided with the federal government and refused to issue a 
restraining order to block the project.

FIREFIGHTERS TO SEEK VOTERS' HELP ON FUNDING; SERVICES: BALLOT INITIATIVE WOULD 
FORCE THE COUNTY TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT PART OF AN EXPECTED $26 MILLION IN 
SALES TAX REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County firefighters decided Wednesday to ask voters to overturn a 
Board of Supervisors decision denying Proposition 172 funds to the county Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Ventura County Professional Firefighters' Assn. voted 
unanimously to begin an effort to place an initiative on the November ballot 
that would force supervisors to give the department a percentage of an expected 
$26 million in special sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage will be decided before firefighters begin circulating petitions 
to put the initiative on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters need 18,753 voters' signatures by June 24 to get their proposal 
on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that we will have any problems at all getting the signatures," 
said Ken Maffei, president of the union. "Most of the people we have talked to 
are outraged with the actions the board took." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Bradley, the county's assistant registrar of voters, predicted that 
obtaining that many signatures will be difficult. "The firefighters certainly 
have a good chance of getting the signatures by June because they are all over 
the county," Bradley said. "But that will not be an easy job." 
</P>
<P>
 The union's move follows the county supervisors' decision last week to give 
nearly all the Proposition 172 funds to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairwoman Vicky Howard said she does not object to the initiative but 
that the firefighters could accomplish their goals through different means. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is necessary for them to put an initiative on the ballot," 
Howard said. "The fire district will receive funds if they submit a strategic 
plan and explain what their need for money is." 
</P>
<P>
 A county audit last year found the Fire Department is top-heavy with managers, 
spends too much on overtime and is lax with sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk did not want to comment on the firefighters' 
decision, and Supervisors John K. Flynn, Maggie Kildee and Susan K. Lacey could 
not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for the firefighters is to draft a proposed initiative, which 
would be submitted to the county counsel for review. 
</P>
<P>
 Once such a proposal is approved, the firefighters would have 180 days to 
circulate petitions and obtain the necessary number of signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the ballot, the initiative would require a majority of votes to 
overturn the supervisors' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recommend that they obtain at least 20% more signatures than they need," 
Bradley said. "Only 80% of the signatures on petitions (usually) are good." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Bradley said, people who have moved out of the county sign petitions. 
"When we check the signatures, we discard the signatures of those people who no 
longer live in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 If the firefighters do not meet the June 24 deadline, they would have to wait 
until June, 1996, unless they could obtain enough signatures to force a special 
election, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 A special election would be called if the firefighters manage to get 37,506 
voters' signatures, Bradley said. Such an election would cost Ventura County 
about $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still in preliminary a state, the firefighters plan to specify in the 
initiative the department's need to create a paramedics program, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said firefighters arrive on emergency scenes before ambulance service 
90% of the time. "It is unacceptable to us that our training is so minimal in 
providing first aid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said the firefighters are prepared to do whatever is necessary to 
obtain the signatures. "If it comes to the point in which we have to set up 
tables in front of grocery stores and the malls, that is what we will do," he 
said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CITY URGES MERGER OF 2 PLANNING AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council has approved asking Ventura County officials to merge 
two planning agencies into a single advisory panel that would consider land use 
policies throughout the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county Local Agency Formation Commission also must approve the 
recommendation, which was made by a group of Ojai Valley residents studying the 
possibility of incorporating the valley into a single city. 
</P>
<P>
 Merging the Ojai and Ventura River Valley areas of interest is considered a 
first step toward someday incorporating a valleywide city, supporters told the 
Ojai City Council late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to unify the valley so that we have a stronger voice in our destiny," 
said Lanie Jo Springer, a member of the Ventura River Valley Municipal Advisory 
Council and a leader of the Local Government Options Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of 26,000 people, only a little over 7,000 are incorporated," Springer 
said. "Our supervisors have a much larger constituency (elsewhere), so our 
voice is not very strong when it comes to certain issues." 
</P>
<P>
 In recommending that a single planning group be established, the council also 
asked that county supervisors extend the boundaries of the Ventura River Valley 
Municipal Advisory Council to include the east end of the Ojai Valley. JEFF 
McDONALD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cabrillo Middle School in Ventura will hold a forum on school safety for 
parents whose children are either entering the middle school this fall or 
graduating to high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to be held from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Cabrillo cafeteria, 
the forum will give parents an opportunity to get their questions about school 
safety answered by local school and police officials, Cabrillo Principal Kris 
Bergstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo officials hold a parent forum early each year, but change the topic 
according to parents' main concerns at that time, Bergstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, school safety is at the forefront of many parents' minds, she said, 
because of recent violence and racial incidents at county schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call Cabrillo at 641-5155. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; COUNCIL OKS REMOVAL OF 12 BLAINE AVE. ELMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 30 years, Peggy Hungate watched helplessly as the elm tree fronting her 
property sprayed sap on her vegetable garden and dropped limbs on curbside 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, she got her revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a sheaf of complaints from Hungate and her neighbors, the 
Fillmore City Council voted 3 to 2 to chop down 12 of Blaine Avenue's stately, 
sap-spitting elms and replace them with sweet shade saplings that officials 
pledge will be less offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The city could end up doling out about $5,200 to remove and replace the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to inflict a tree on anyone," Councilman Don Gunderson said 
as he agreed to demolish the elms, which are more than 40 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Brewster voted against the removal because she said she thinks 
that the trees look beautiful. Councilman Mike McMahan voted against the 
proposal because he did not want to replace the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hungate said the two council members do not understand the magnitude of 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to come up and have spit fly in your face while you are 
gardening, why then come up, you're welcome," she told the mayor. "These trees 
are monsters. They are a real terrible thing to have to live with." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the tendrils of the trees cover her beloved vegetables. Roots snake 
around the water pipes, making them nearly impossible to repair. The flying, 
spraying sap triggers her family's allergies and sticks to car paint like 
lacquer. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who say they enjoy the shade don't have trees in their front yard," 
Hungate said. 
</P>
<P>
 About half a dozen of Hungate's neighbors wrote city officials to complain 
about the elms. 
</P>

 "The lawn doesn't get enough sun to grow nice," wrote Jane Johnson, who lives 
down the block from Hungate. "We like a nice yard, but (the trees) make it 
impossible."

 Besides, Johnson added in a letter listing six reasons why she despises the

<P>
 Organizers of the Ventura County Science Fair are seeking retired teachers and 
other county residents who have a background in science to serve as volunteer 
judges for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. and the county 
superintendent of schools, this year's science fair will be held April 19-21 at 
the County Fairgrounds in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the sixth through 12th grades in public and private schools are 
entering science projects in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer judges will be asked to attend an orientation and barbecue dinner in 
Camarillo on April 13, in addition to spending about four hours judging entries 
at the fairgrounds April 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The science fair will present awards in eight categories: botany; chemistry or 
biochemistry; earth, space and environment; math and computers; microbiology 
and medical science; physics; psychology, sociology and human behavior; and 
zoology and human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But organizers said their biggest need is for people to judge the botany 
entries. For more information, call Elaine Daugherty at 388-4411. MAIA DAVIS

 Oxnard police have arrested a 24-year-old man on suspicion of possessing tar 
heroin and cocaine during a raid on an Oxnard Boulevard motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Galdamez of Oxnard was taken into custody about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday when 
police served a search warrant at the E-Z Motel, 512 E. Date St. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being held without bail in County Jail on suspicion of possessing 
narcotics for sale and on a felony warrant from the San Jose area. Galdamez is 
scheduled to be arraigned today in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Room 51 at the motel, officers confiscated 0.7 of a gram of heroin and 
0.4 of a gram of cocaine. The bust occurred after a three-week investigation 
into drug activity at the motel. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SHOOTING SUSPECT WILL BE EVALUATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man accused of shooting and injuring a 14-year-old Ventura boy will undergo 
a psychological evaluation to determine if he is competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Bruce A. Clark on Monday suspended a preliminary hearing 
to allow a psychologist time to evaluate Brian Adams, 21, of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney George Eskin told Clark that he has reason to doubt his 
client's competency, Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison said. Eskin was unable 
to be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Adams, 21, is accused of forcing his way into 14-year-old Kevin Natale's 
Ventura Keys home in January and firing several shots from a 9-millimeter 
handgun before hitting Kevin in the neck. He was apparently angry because the 
youth hit his car with a baseball while playing catch, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 An examination of Adams by Dr. Bernyce Byars, a private physician, must be 
completed by March 28, Ellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted first-degree murder and 
first-degree burglary and denied a special allegation that he used a firearm in 
the commission of a felony, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Adams could receive 25 years to life in prison, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin is receiving treatment at the rehabilitation center at St. John's 
Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. The bullet that lodged in his shoulder could 
leave him a quadriplegic, Ellison said. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: AGOURA; INVESTMENT BANKER'S CONVICTION UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time, a state appeals court has upheld the 1992 theft and 
conspiracy conviction of Charles J. Francoeur, a former Agoura investment 
banker. 
</P>
<P>
 The California 2nd District Court of Appeal also shaved eight months off 
Francoeur's sentence, ruling that he had been double-sentenced for a theft 
count and should serve only seven years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Francoeur has been free on bail pending appeal. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Rebecca 
Riley, who prosecuted the case, said his status probably will be reviewed when 
the appeals court returns the case to Superior Court Judge Frederick Jones, who 
tried the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said she would rather the appeals court had left Francoeur's full 
seven-year, eight-month sentence intact, but she is glad this chapter of the 
case is closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Francoeur could not be reached Wednesday for comment, but his attorney, Wendy 
Lascher, said "he wasn't happy" with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's an issue for the California Supreme Court here, and we're 
going to petition for a review," Lascher said. She said she will argue the jury 
was not properly instructed that a conviction for theft must be based partly on 
proof that Francoeur intended to permanently deprive his victim of property -- 
proof that was lacking at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Francoeur and Olen B. Phillips became the targets of an 81-count 
indictment by the Ventura County grand jury on charges that they bilked 21 
investors out of more than $3 million in complicated land investment deals. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a complex four-month trial, the jury only convicted Phillips of one 
theft charge and Francoeur of four counts of theft and one of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair appealed their convictions. Last year, the appeals court upheld the 
convictions and agreed that eight months should be taken off Francoeur's 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Francoeur alone asked for a rehearing by the appeals court, which held a 
second hearing and then made the same ruling again on on Tuesday. MACK REED

 A Thousand Oaks sheriff's deputy who oversees an anti-drug, anti-gang program 
in the city's middle schools attended a briefing on crime programs with the 
vice president in Washington, D. C., on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bruce Hansen was one of 150 law-enforcement officials and local 
government representatives who took part in the four-hour meeting with Vice 
President Al Gore, Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, Secretary of Education 
Richard Riley and Undersecretary of the Treasury Ronald Nobel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen went to Washington to represent Thousand Oaks' Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, introduced to the city in 1985, is taught by uniformed officers 
in sixth- and eighth-grade classrooms. Along with the anti-drug message, the 
program stresses self-esteem, dealing with peer pressure and conflict 
resolution. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: SIMI VALLEY; OFFICIALS TO FIGHT PLAN FOR K MART 
STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials said they will recommend against a proposal to build a K 
mart store across from City Hall because plans for the vacant lot call for an 
outdoor mall. 
</P>
<P>
 K mart representatives, who still hope to persuade the city to support the 
project, will present plans for the 117,000-square-foot store and accompanying 
shops at a neighborhood council meeting at 7:30 tonight at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said Wednesday they have already concluded that the 
proposal does not fit into plans for the vacant lot on the southwest corner of 
Tapo Canyon Road and Alamo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our opinion is that K mart has not achieved what we want in terms of a 
development that attracts pedestrian traffic by using a cluster of stores," 
said Wolf Ascher, deputy director of current planning.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they stick to their standard design of a huge rectangle with parking up 
front, it's not going to meet our objectives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 K mart officials said they still hope to reach a compromise with city 
officials before the project is heard by the Planning Commission in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel as though there's still potential," said Michael Theisen, K mart's 
project manager. "All of their concerns deal with things that we think are 
workable." 
</P>
<P>
 K mart has been working for more than a year on plans to build its second 
store in the city. The neighborhood council has reviewed previous plans and 
recommended against them, said Randi Joseph, a neighborhood council 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say how it will turn out this time, but it doesn't look promising," 
Joseph said. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: SIMI VALLEY; FREE CLINIC HONORS CHAMBER OFFICIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley nonprofit group has honored Chamber of Commerce head Nancy 
Bender for helping link civic leaders with social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Free Clinic, which provides medical, legal and counseling aid 
to needy residents, presented Bender with its second annual Spirit Award in a 
ceremony last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender, a former city councilwoman who has served as executive director of the 
chamber for 12 years, was chosen for the award because of a leadership training 
program she runs at the chamber, said Fred Bauermeister, executive director of 
the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership program, which is open to the public, introduces trainees to 
various aspects of community life, including city government, the media and 
health services. The group meets once a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauermeister said one of last year's trainees, a local physician, was so 
impressed by the clinic that he joined the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy has really put together a great program," Bauermeister said. "It's been 
invaluable in giving the clinic the positive exposure it needs." 
</P>
<P>
 At the awards ceremony, Bender received a plaque and a $500 contribution to 
the leadership program. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honored in this way is an absolute delight," Bender said. "It is 
something I will treasure all my life." SARA CATANIA

QUAKE-DAMAGED SIMI HIGH IS REOPENING; AFTERMATH: MAJOR REPAIRS, INCLUDING 
ASBESTOS REMOVAL, ARE COMPLETED. STUDENTS HAVE BEEN GOING TO CLASS AT RIVAL 
ROYAL CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two months after Simi Valley High School was closed because of 
earthquake damage, the campus will reopen Wednesday, welcoming back students 
who have been attending cross-town rival Royal High on a split schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Major repairs at Simi Valley High have been completed, including asbestos 
removal that forced the 2,100-student school to open shop at Royal for several 
weeks, officials said Wednesday. To ease the transition back to Simi High, next 
Wednesday and Thursday will be half days there, running from 8 a.m. to 12:50 
p.m., officials said. Students across the district will have March 18 off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's really looking forward to it, and they're very anxious," said 
Simi Valley Unified School District Supt. Mary Beth Wolford. "We want to make 
it as smooth a transition as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Major structural problems will keep the gym and multipurpose room off-limits. 
The district has yet to receive an estimate for repairs on those two buildings, 
which could run as high as $1 million. Total damage at Simi Valley High is 
estimated at $3 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with most repairs completed, students may notice minor cracks and 
refinishing work that still needs to be done, Assistant Supt. Ralph Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably be doing cosmetic work for the next several months, I'm sure," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal and Simi Valley high students have been sharing a campus since Jan. 27, 
with Royal students attending from 7 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and Simi Valley 
students going from noon to about 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their longstanding rivalry, the students pulled together to make the 
arrangement work, Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of the students, especially for the fine way they've shared a 
school under the most difficult of circumstances," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Handling a double load of traffic proved to be the most difficult adjustment 
for school officials, with only a 30-minute buffer to move out one student body 
and bring in the next one. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High senior Melissa Beckham, 17, said she and most of her friends 
are looking forward to getting back to a normal schedule at their home school. 
But not all students agree, Melissa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to a couple that are used to sleeping in now," Melissa said. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the district has sustained more than $5 million in damage from the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. Two other schools, Valley View Junior High and 
Township Elementary School, were closed for a week by the magnitude 6.8 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he expects the district to receive 90% or more of the cleanup and 
repair costs from the state and federal governments. The district has received 
$1 million in grant money so far, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're drowning in paperwork, but so far FEMA has been great," Wilson said, 
referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency responsible for doling out 
much of the relief.

AROUND THE VALLEY: WITHIN THE WALLS OF GAY BATHHOUSE LIES A WORLD OF THEIR OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the left of me, four men were having sex. Only two of them were actually 
looking at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Romance didn't much enter into it. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, in their late 20s or early 30s, sat on wide stairs built into one 
wall of the dimly lit, high-ceilinged "erotic video lounge" at the Compound, 
the best-known gay bathhouse in the San Fernando Valley. About a dozen others, 
naked or wearing only white towels around their waists, sat around the room. 
Some casually watched while others, including two of the four men who were 
fondling each other, stared at porn films on video monitors high on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The sex on the screen, featuring three men in hard hats, was a good deal more 
vigorous than what was going on in the room. No one in the room talked. 
</P>
<P>
 I moved on. One gay man's erotica is another's boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Compound is a survivor. A decade ago, Los Angeles boasted slick, high-tech 
bathhouses famous throughout the gay world. But as the specter of AIDS darkened 
the mid-1980s, the baths came under fire as places where unsafe, multi-partner 
sex spread the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the gay community decried this crackdown as officialdom using acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome as an excuse to inhibit their lifestyles. Others 
countered with an argument that essentially said: It's an epidemic, stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an argument with no easy answer for those of us who treasured 
individual freedom but also grabbed onto any measure that might curb AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, many of the high-profile baths closed. A new generation of gay men 
arrived at a time when bathhouses were neither chic nor a political statement. 
Less than a decade after their heyday, bathhouses seem old-fashioned, if not 
quaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Compound in North Hollywood is low-profile and low-tech, more like a dowdy 
hotel than a pleasure palace. Windowless, with a plain brown facade, it sits in 
a drab industrial/retail area beside the Valley Community Clinic. Inside the 
front door sat a cashier, behind glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first time here," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know where you are?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 I said yes, he explained anyway and told me the three cardinal rules: "No 
alcohol, no drugs, no unsafe sex." I slipped $13 under the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 He buzzed me through a door bearing a sign: "This club caters to adult gay 
men. . .If you are offended by any aspect of this lifestyle, do not enter." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, disco music with an incessant beat and no discernible lyrics came from 
overhead speakers. The attendant directed me to a shelf of brochures on safe 
sex and two fishbowls of free condoms. Bathhouse owners under siege have long 
maintained their establishments are safe sex educational centers. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave me a locker key, checked my valuables and issued me the standard 
apparel -- a towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs was the video lounge, which one suspects in past times was the orgy 
room. Most of the men that Saturday night simply sat with their towels wrapped 
around them, watching the video. There was some physical contact, but not much 
-- and little apparent emotional interaction. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, however, a lot of "attitude" on display -- it did not seem cool in 
most cases to add anything to the action that might be interpreted as 
affection. 
</P>
<P>
 No idle chitchat. Even a casual attempt at a journalistic interview would have 
been about as welcome as a Department of Health raid. 
</P>
<P>
 The more heavy-duty sex presumedly took place in 33 private rooms that could 
be rented for the night for fees ranging from $10 for a room about the size of 
a sofa to $25. 
</P>
<P>
 All the rooms had been taken. There was a waiting list for vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Men cruised the hallways in this section, peering into open doorways. What 
they saw, generally, was a man lying on the mat, waiting. If the cruiser liked 
what he saw, he might linger outside the door hoping for an invitation to come 
in and close the door. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, wearing a baseball cap, stood outside a room containing a man sitting 
cross-legged on a mat, smoking a cigarette. The cruiser stood there while at 
least two cigarettes were smoked, but no invitation came. Finally, he walked 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the doors were left open while the sex was happening inside. In one 
of the small rooms, five men were engaged in a scene so crowded and convoluted 
that it more resembled the stateroom bit in "A Night At The Opera" than a 
bacchanal. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an important difference. In "A Night At The Opera," people seemed to 
be having fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would a gay man go to a place like this? The obvious answer is: for 
uninvolved, anonymous sex. But there is more, here. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the walls of a bathhouse lies a totally homosexual world unlike 
anywhere on the outside. Even on the streets of gay enclaves such as West 
Hollywood, there are billboards showing heterosexual couples, straight love 
songs on the radio and plenty of reminders ranging from magazine covers to 
movie posters that to be gay in this society is to be different. 
</P>
<P>
 Except in the rarely visited TV room downstairs, where "Benny Hill" was 
showing when I first entered the bathhouse, there were no such influences 
inside the Compound. It may not be an edifying atmosphere, but it's at least 
one where being gay is not outside the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way out of the bathhouse, I stopped downstairs in the TV lounge where 
some of the men seen engaged in sex upstairs were taking a rest. The nearby dry 
sauna was deserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so the steam room. The steamy atmosphere there had inspired at least a 
couple of men to get together. Here, partly hidden by the fog, the public 
display of sex did seem to have more an element of affection to it. But after a 
couple of minutes, one of the men turned and left. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not say, "We will always have the Compound." No one said anything at 
all.

DEVELOPERS TOUT PLAN FOR GIANT MALL, CENTER; NEWBURY PARK: ARCHITECTS EXPLAIN 
PROJECT FOR ADVENTIST PROPERTY. SOME COUNCIL MEMBERS EXPRESS RESERVATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Developers of the elaborate Seventh-day Adventist project in Newbury Park took 
advantage of a public forum to present -- in glowing terms but with little 
detail -- their plans for a huge new shopping mall and entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
 With slides, sketches and a model the size of a banquet table, local 
architects Francisco Behr and Dale Ortmann explained to the Thousand Oaks City 
Council on Tuesday their vision of a massive commercial center on the Adventist 
Church's 400-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on one of the city's largest remaining undeveloped parcels, the center 
would bristle with places to spend money, from discount warehouses to upscale 
restaurants to mom-and-pop hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The design would blend nostalgic elements, such as an old-fashioned outdoor 
plaza, with futuristic touches, like electric outlets to plug in high-tech 
cars. When complete, the complex would contain a 12-screen movie theater and a 
courtyard for farmers' markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Adventists want this project to be something they can be proud of and 
show off to the community," Behr said. 
</P>
<P>
 But several council members weren't so easily convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they asked few questions at the study session, Mayor Elois Zeanah and 
Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski afterward expressed concern that the mega-mall 
could strip business from stores elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to spread ourselves too thin," Zukowski said Wednesday. "There 
are many ramifications to creating something of this scale, especially when 
we're already trying to make Thousand Oaks Boulevard the center of our city and 
enhance the small businesses there." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski also worried aloud that the development might carry hidden costs for 
the city, such as the expense of hiring more police officers to patrol the 
sprawling shopping center. To address neighbors' security concerns, the council 
may consider opening a small police station in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be very careful that we're not overloading," Zeanah said, "that 
we're not developing more than that area can handle." 
</P>
<P>
 While agreeing that traffic, environmental and economic impacts should be 
carefully studied, other council members on Tuesday expressed qualified support 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The model looks wonderful," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "I'm really 
impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the plans to bring in several chain restaurants, such as California 
Pizza Kitchen, Olive Garden and Red Lobster, Lazar added jokingly: "If this 
thing gets built, all we'll ever do there is eat." 
</P>
<P>
 The project remains months away from public hearings, as the environmental and 
economic impact studies will take weeks to complete. But Behr and Ortmann 
wanted to gauge public reaction now, while they have time to modify their 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's study session, they received several thumbs-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Three residents stepped to the microphone to endorse the project and praise 
the architects for working closely with neighbors. Complaining that they must 
now travel to Camarillo or Oxnard to shop at discount warehouses, they urged 
the developers to bring a Price/Costco, Mervyn's or similar stores to the 
Adventist property. 
</P>
<P>
 A Target store would be built in the first phase of construction and could be 
ready to open by late 1995, the architects said. 
</P>
<P>
 To handle the increased traffic, the developers plan to reconfigure the Wendy 
Drive off-ramp if state transportation officials approve. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the road work, grading and utilities, the project's infrastructure 
costs could reach $50 million. On top of that, each merchant would have to pay 
to build a chunk of the commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also involves relocating the Adventist church, school and senior 
housing that stand in the path of the proposed Target store and parking lot. 
Officials would also have to raze the Two Winds equestrian center to make room 
for the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's study session, Lazar urged the developers to find a new site for 
the stables and riding rings, "not necessarily because everyone uses them but 
because of the flavor and ambience they lend to the community." Proposed 
Development The Seventh-day Adventist Church has proposed building a huge 
commercial center-including movie theaters, discount stores and restaurants-on 
part of its 400-acre parcel adjacent to the Rancho Conejo Industrial Park. The 
church would relocate its school, sanctuary and senior citizen bungalows to 
another section of the property. Source: Francico Behr, Architect

6TH-GRADERS MAY BE ALLOWED IN MIDDLE SCHOOL; EDUCATION: CONEJO VALLEY DISTRICT 
WEIGHS GIVING PARENTS THE OPTION. STATE RECOMMENDS SUCH A MOVE FOR STUDENTS OF 
THAT AGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks school officials tonight will consider allowing sixth-graders to 
attend school with seventh- and eighth-grade students at one of the district's 
four intermediate schools beginning in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving parents the option to send their sixth-grade students to middle school, 
rather than keeping them with younger children at the elementary level, not 
only expands parental choice but follows state recommendations for students of 
that age, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the school board decides to go ahead with a pilot project, Colina 
Intermediate School would house the middle school because it has room for 
additional students, officials said. The project would cost no extra money, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is successful after two years, the middle school at Colina would become 
mandatory to relieve crowding at Conejo and Westlake Hills elementary schools, 
which would become kindergarten through fifth-grade schools in the 1996-97 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, parents from those two schools who did not want their sixth-graders 
attending a middle school could choose to transfer them to an elementary 
school, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-grade classrooms would be in a cluster, with a separate locker area. 
The students would alternate among three teachers a day rather than six as the 
seventh- and eighth-graders do, Colina Principal Michael Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that providing sixth-graders a transition between elementary and 
intermediate school helps them adjust better than if they abruptly go from 
having one to several teachers a day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the sixth-graders developmentally resemble the older intermediate 
school students more than elementary schoolchildren, Conejo Valley Unified 
School District Supt. Jerry Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 112 students are needed to make the project possible, and no more 
than 150 can be accepted, Gross said. If the board approves the idea, parents 
would have until May 1 to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some very positive responses from parents, and some aren't 
interested in it at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on word-of-mouth, officials expect the idea to prove popular, Waters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we'll have to go into a lottery format (to randomly select 
students), because we'll have more interest than we can accommodate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks parent Susan Malone, who served on a committee that reviewed the 
middle school proposal, said the idea of making the option voluntary is 
crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fifth-grader thinks it might be a real exciting opportunity, but maybe 
there are sixth-graders that would be more comfortable in a smaller elementary 
school environment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had studied the idea of converting all elementary schools to 
kindergarten through fifth grade and making the four intermediate schools into 
middle schools. But portable classrooms would be needed to handle the overflow, 
making the change too costly, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 A state reform document issued in 1987, titled "Caught in the Middle," 
recommends that sixth-graders be housed with older students. More activities 
are available at the middle schools, and principals have more opportunity to 
get to know students and their families, Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can develop a much stronger relationship with students at a three-year 
school," Waters added. "There's just a real strong feeling among the principals 
that we need to be doing this."

 Graveside services are scheduled Friday for Betty Jane Shattuck, a former 
elementary school principal in Ventura who died Wednesday. She was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Shattuck, born in Whittier, came to Ventura with her family in 1937, said her 
sister, Colyn Warren of Cerritos.  
</P>
<P>
 Shattuck majored in education at Pepperdine University and went on to USC, 
where she received a master's degree in education and reading before returning 
to Ventura to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked with the Ventura Unified School District for the next 35 years, 
eventually serving as principal at three Ventura elementary schools -- E.P. 
Foster, El Camino and Pierpont. She retired in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 She also taught at the Church of Christ Bible school and was active in the 
Pepperdine alumni association, her sister said. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by her sister, a son, Clark Shattuck of Ventura, and three 
nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 Graveside services will be held at 3 p.m. Friday at Ivy Lawn Cemetery. A 
memorial service will be held 3 p.m. Sunday at the Ventura Church of Christ.

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW; ADVENTURE STARTS WITH 'TOM SAWYER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 A tot lot here, a carefully stocked mini mall there . . . City planners may 
knock themselves out designing "proper" hangouts for kids, but down Mission 
Viejo way, there's a new hot spot that blows their tidy formulas right out of 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past couple of months, a growing number of local youths have been 
hanging in a neat but colorless industrial park called the Mission Viejo 
Business Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet: Children's Theatre Village, a fledgling youth theater company 
that, if all goes as planned, will turn out a family-oriented musical theater 
performance every month or two for, hopefully, a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in the back room of a commercial costume-rental shop, the company 
debuted last weekend with a musical adaptation of "Tom Sawyer." The show, 
directed by CTV founder Denise Fenton and featuring 25 youngsters and a 
smattering of local adults, continues through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8- to 15-year-old kids have spent their time well. Although this Frank 
Luther adaptation of Mark Twain's classic "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" has 
its faults (many tunes are forgettable and out of sync with the story's 
historical setting, and the compression of Twain's novel into an hourlong 
musical leaves only a trace of the author's remarkable wit), Fenton's lively 
cast makes the best of it, and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical numbers are tight; visuals are simple and bright, and, when coupled 
with the cozy dimensions of the house (it seats 65, plus a few kids on the 
front-row mat), it adds up to an engaging, bite-size bit of family theater 
suitable for kindergartners and up. 
</P>
<P>
 Either by design or because she lacks storage space, Fenton tweaks our 
imaginations as soon as we enter the theater space. Lining three of the four 
walls are flats from unrelated shows, including a vine-covered cottage wall, 
the front of an imposing stone castle and a small forest of creepy-looking 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 A proscenium arch built across part of the fourth wall frames a shallow stage. 
For "Tom Sawyer," it is decorated with little more than a cheery yellow shack 
and a picket fence. It makes for an intimate, behind-the-scenes atmosphere that 
should help get first-time theatergoers in the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenton gets things rolling with a cute but unnecessary pre-show bit in which 
the Princess of Storyland (Meghan Marshall) gives tips on how to enjoy 
children's theater, down to the location of the restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, the cast moseys on stage for "Big Missouri," the first of 
the show's many song-and-dance numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 For these, Fenton and choreographer Tod Kubo make good use of the stage's 
small space (and the cast members' varying dancing abilities) by splitting the 
crowd into two groups: a chorus that vamps on the sidelines and a six-member 
dance team that performs more complicated steps center stage. It works well for 
the audience, and probably saves smaller cast members from having their toes 
tromped. 
</P>
<P>
 Luther has set nearly all of the novel's most familiar scenes to song. It's a 
good hook for short attention spans, but it relegates Twain's masterful writing 
to the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The whitewash scene, Becky and Tom's courtship, even the description of the 
misfit Huck Finn become fodder for bouncy musical numbers that could have come 
straight from an episode of "Hee Haw."  
</P>
<P>
 The story's darker elements have been sweetened for young audiences, too. The 
murder of Doc in the graveyard goes by in a blink, and Tom's and Becky's 
moments in the cave that hides the murderous Injun Joe are more cozy than 
scary. 
</P>
<P>
 As Tom, Harley Bertram is a lovable scamp given to bug-eyed stares and 
conspiratorial grins and partners well with Ian Stone, who plays Huckleberry 
Finn with a nice mix of bravado tinged with childish uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall's Becky Thatcher is nobody's fool, and, although she had some trouble 
finding her pitch on Saturday night, she has one of the cast's strongest 
singing voices. (The parts of Becky and Huck are among several that are double 
cast; Tiffany Moon and Chad Bowman alternate in the roles.) Tricia Cannon was a 
standout in the dance ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fenton, a 20-year veteran of Downey Civic Light Opera and a part-time musical 
theater instructor at a South County high school, said she opened her 
Masquerade Village Costumes in 1991 with hopes of starting a children's theater 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly housed in a shopping center, her business moved to its current 
location in December, and by January she had announced auditions for "Tom 
Sawyer." Fenton is applying for nonprofit status for the company, which will 
present two weekend runs of Broadway-style musicals. Future productions will 
include Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella," "Into the Woods" and "Give My 
Regards to Broadway. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A teen company will be formed this summer to present "Little Shop of Horrors," 
and in December, a mixed-age cast will stage an extended run of "The Little 
Christmas Forest."

THEATER REVIEW; CSUF PROVES YOU CAN TAKE THE '30S WITH YOU

 The costume worn by ballet master Kolenkhov in Cal State Fullerton's revival 
of Kaufman and Hart's classic "You Can't Take It With You" is the only glaring 
error in the staging's authenticity. Even the anachronistic portable typewriter 
Penny uses to write her plays can be forgiven, but not the moujik boots and 
blousy shirt. Kolenkhov is a gentleman, one who socializes with the nobility; 
his suit and flowing tie in Act III finally have him in the proper attire. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Juan Lopez's costume design is flawless, as is Stacey Westbrook's 
fine lighting, happily bright without losing its good period tone. The most 
striking production element, though, is Todd Muffatti's re-creation of the 
Vanderhof parlor-dining room, which has the exact dimensions of a townhouse in 
Manhattan's upper West Side -- a detail most scenic designers ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Dan Kern doesn't ignore details either in his gracious, energetic and 
well-shaped staging. And he doesn't make the mistake of trying to inform the 
production with the sensibilities of a later time. Its feet are firmly in the 
middle '30s, during the Great Depression, and the play's message about living 
life to the fullest whether you have money or not is as valid in today's bleak 
economy as it was when Kaufman and Hart wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest actor James Greene is a perfect Grandpa Vanderhof -- brisk and slightly 
cynical on the surface, full of bubbling humor and gentle warmth underneath, in 
a performance that gives the production its key to the right tone. 
</P>
<P>
 As his peripherally befuddled daughter-in-law Penny, who started writing plays 
because someone left the typewriter there years ago, Leslie Mitts has a 
grinning good cheer that perfectly complements the sincere concentration of 
Mark John Packer as Paul, Grandpa's fireworks-obsessed son. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen M. Gilbert and Cecily Davis are very good as Paul and Penny's 
respective daughters, ballet-crazed Essie and Alice, who is in love with her 
boss' son. Davis, whose light voice matches her stylish performance, looks 
particularly right in her scenes with Matthew Schleicher as the object of her 
affections. They have an interestingly down-to-earth quality often missing in 
the roles. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The aforementioned Kolenkhov (Duncan Mandel), drunken actress Gay Wellington 
(Barbara Streifel) and Russian Grand Duchess Olga (Kirsten S. Vangsness) are, 
along with most of the characters, the caricatures of which '30s comedy was 
made, and the actors wisely hold their outrageousness in check for the most 
part, to good effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Voss is too large and bombastic as IRS collector Henderson, and Jennifer 
E. Ryan's maid Rheba verges on being too classy. But Jason Powell, as Rheba's 
boyfriend Donald, is right on the button in fine period style.

CLUB REVIEW; DESPITE DRAB DECOR, PAN SPRINGS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps because Silver Lake rates as a low-key locale on the hipster club 
spectrum, Pan -- a new Thursday night club at Dreamz -- is a comfortably 
inviting scene.  
</P>
<P>
 With its truck-stop interior and drab decor, Pan is a great example of how a 
venue can spring to life with a bit of ingenuity and some good music. 
</P>
<P>
 With its eclectic music selection and a backdrop of five video monitors 
looping continuous images of the Unarians -- sect members who wear outer space 
costumes and wait to be beamed up by a higher life form -- Pan makes life on 
Earth seem pretty cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Although last week the club featured an inspired live show by the psychedelic 
blues-funk trio Mecolodiacs, you can generally count on the wide-ranging music 
taste of deejay Reverend Mauricio Figuls. From the funky '70s sounds of War's 
"Spill the Wine" and Rufus' "Tell Me Something Good" to Tom Jones' version of 
"Ring of Fire" and the Tikis' "Surfadelic," Figuls creates a unique strain of 
dance fever. 
</P>
<P>
 Pan seems to draw an effortlessly mixed group of people, from neighborhood 
Latinos to club-goers from South-Central and Hollywood. After a few more 
selections from Marvin Gaye, David Bowie and the Ohio Players, you're reminded 
that there really is something for everyone here. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pan at Dreamz on Thursdays, 1717 N. Silver Lake Blvd . , (213) 481-2229. 
Cover varies from $3 to $5. * JEWEL OF A POOL HALL

 GOING EXTRA MILE: Here's a claim by Anaheim motorcycle cop Jim Saenz that 
someone may challenge: "I'm the biggest Garth Brooks fan in Orange County." How 
big? Saenz and his police partner, Vince Ferraro, both veteran Brooks 
concert-goers, will drive 2,000 miles to see a Garth Brooks concert in Sioux 
City, Iowa, on March 25. . . . "If you haven't seen his show before, it's 
something you just can't miss," he says. Saenz adds that he's never been this 
excited about any other performer: "I've videotaped all his TV appearances." 
</P>
<P>
 A PET BILL: A bill that made it through committee in Sacramento this week 
would make it legal to own ferrets. California is one of just four states that 
ban the weasel-like critters, and state health and wildlife officials want to 
keep it that way. They say ferrets can bite small children, or can escape and 
threaten native wildlife. But one Anaheim woman who illegally owns ferrets 
disagrees: "They're very tame, great pets." And Orange County veterinarian 
Richard Evans argues that ferrets are less likely to bite children than are 
cats or dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 MISSING CHRIS: If Anaheim folks are happy that the Rams signed former Falcons 
quarterback Chris Miller, they're less happy in Atlanta. Under a headline 
"Miller Time Over," the Atlanta Constitution wrote this week that his departure 
"magnifies the unsettled quarterback situation still facing the Falcons." . . . 
Adds Falcons Coach June Jones, who was close to Miller: "You wish maybe things 
had turned out differently." 
</P>
<P>
 KEEPSAKE? Ever wish you'd held on to a case of Billy Beer? There's a new 
collector's item coming onto the market: Sports Specialties in Irvine -- a Nike 
subsidiary -- has acquired the rights to market a Michael Jordan Chicago White 
Sox baseball cap. It's like the other White Sox caps except it says "Jordan 45" 
on the back -- the new number of the former No. 23 of the Chicago Bulls. A 
company spokesman says the cap will honor Jordan's "quest" to be a baseball 
player.

 AFTER SCHOOL: Andre Chevalier, last week you broke the all-time hoop scoring 
record at Cal State Northridge. Where are you going next? Disneyland? The NBA? 
Well, actually, he's not sure. . . . Chevalier majors in Pan-African studies 
and shows an interest in business, but has no definite plans. "Something will 
come up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW ERA: The future is closer than you think. Especially the car future. The 
California Air Resources Board released a report Tuesday saying the technology 
is available for electric cars (A3). . . . This comes as no surprise to the 
folks at Calstart, a nonprofit consortium in Burbank launched in 1992 to help 
create parts for electric vehicles. "The staff of the air board now know what 
we know," said Michael Gage, Calstart's president. 
</P>
<P>
 PRICEY POET: Sure, so maybe CSUN couldn't land any big-name speakers to visit 
the school last fall, but this is a new year. On March 17, prized poet and 
Clinton favorite Maya Angelou, above, will read some of her works on campus. . 
. . The treat won't come cheaply, though -- she charges $15,000. "She'll be 
well worth it," a campus official said. "We are all very excited." 
</P>
<P>
 CROSSING BORDERS: Mexican music is coming to the Valley, and we don't mean the 
hip version played by American rockers demonstrating their diversity. We mean 
the real thing. . . . Four Mexican rock bands will perform Saturday at 
Universal Amphitheatre in "Revolucion '94," which is also an attempt at helping 
us neighbors get along better. "This should have happened 30 years ago," the 
concert organizer said (F3). 
</P>
<P>
 SAME MAPS: The quake has changed our lives forever, but there is some good 
news: At least it won't change our beloved Thomas Bros. books. . . . "Most of 
the corrected work will be completed by the time our new books go out in 
September," a spokeswoman for the Irvine-based maps company said. Michael 
Arkush

 CENSORSHIP CENSURE: Gov. Pete Wilson has admonished state education officials 
for deleting excerpts of the works of Pulitzer Prize-winning authors Alice 
Walker and Annie Dillard from a new state test (A3). . . . Wilson criticized 
the decision in a letter to the State Board of Education. Some Ventura County 
educators support Wilson's move. . . . "These writers are very high-quality 
literary figures," said Susanna Arce, assistant principal and curriculum 
director at Ojai's Nordhoff High."It's amazing what people find fault with." 
</P>
<P>
 NO BEER HERE: Simi Valley schools have received $4,000 from the 
Washington-based Beer Institute to expand anti-drug programs. . . . The money, 
from the institute's community assistance fund, will be used to teach 
elementary schoolchildren "lessons about healthy lifestyles, respect for their 
bodies and some refusal skills," district official Rebecca Wetzel said. . . . 
Funding requests from schools are up, institute spokesman Jeff Becker said. 
"They, like everybody else, are having money problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 SADDLING UP: What price glory? . . . That question may cross the minds of 
Ventura County's handful of custom saddle makers, who face an array of painful 
hazards to produce their high-quality work (Ventura County Life, Page 24). . . 
. The craftsmen go to great lengths to build custom seats. Accidents -- hands 
cut by knives or even tough sewing thread -- are common. . . . One saddle maker 
has an unusual first-aid tool: Super Glue. "I glue the cuts together," Steve 
Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYING TO WIN: Michael Tate and the No. 1-ranked Ventura College Pirates will 
play Cosumnes River tonight as competition begins for the state championship 
(C10). . . . Known for his intensity on the court, the sophomore center 
epitomizes the team's motto: "We Play Hard." . . . Tate helped lead the Pirates 
to last week's victory over Imperial Valley. . . . "I think we have a real good 
chance of winning the whole thing if everyone stays focused," he said.

FRANK NEWMAN; LAGUNA AIDS ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Newman, a founding member of several Orange County gay and lesbian 
groups and a campaigner for AIDS education, died last week of AIDS-related 
complications at the St. Edna Nursing Center in Santa Ana. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, a longtime Laguna Beach resident who was also involved in 
environmental and preservationist groups such as Village Laguna, was described 
by family and friends as relentlessly committed to the gay community as well as 
his city. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as co-chair of Laguna Outreach, a nonprofit group providing 
education on gay issues, between 1983 and 1987, and continued to be active in 
the organization until he became seriously ill, said his brother, Fred Newman 
of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman also helped set up Laguna's AIDS Education Task Force, Orange County's 
first such group, and co-founded the Orange County Federation of Lesbian, Gay 
and Feminist Organizations. He also worked with the Elections Committee of the 
County of Orange, which supports candidates who advocate for gay and lesbian 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, a marketing consultant, was known for his wit and integrity, family 
and friends said. They also described him as a gourmet cook who had 
painstakingly restored an inn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in up to the ears all the time -- didn't know any other way to 
operate," Fred Newman said of his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, Frank Newman was dedicated to his community and to educational 
issues, Fred Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that he lived and breathed it, and I think he felt a great sense of 
satisfaction, not only when successes occurred," but when he brought people 
with disparate views together, Fred Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman also worked as a consultant to the National AIDS Information and 
Education Program of the federal Centers for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was extremely proud of the work that he did for the CDC," Fred 
Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Prevatt, co-chair of the board of directors of the Gay and Lesbian 
Community Services Center of Orange County in Garden Grove, said Newman's 
"contributions to this community are well recognized and he's going to be 
sorely missed. He was very valuable in bringing together different groups in 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman is survived by his mother, Ruthe Streeter of Santa Cruz; his 
stepmother, Anita Newman of Aptos; his sisters, Donna Streeter of Santa Cruz 
and Carol Howten, of Watsonville; and Fred Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 The family asks that memorial gifts be made to the AIDS Services Foundation of 
Orange County or to Laguna Shanti, an AIDS organization that Newman supported.

FERNANDO REY, 76; DEBONAIR FILM STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Rey, the suave, debonair international actor from Spain best known 
for his roles in the films of surrealist director Luis Bunuel and as a drug 
lord in "The French Connection," died Wednesday in Madrid. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Rey, who appeared in more than 150 films made in Spain, France, Italy, Germany 
and the United States over half a century, died at his home of bladder cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Rey had served as president of the Spanish Academy of 
Cinematographic Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 The impeccably tailored and bearded actor, once described by "French 
Connection" producer Phil D'Antoni as "the last of the Continental guys," 
achieved perhaps his greatest success in the 1970s when he had already turned 
50. Rey portrayed the elegantly evil villain opposite Gene Hackman in "The 
French Connection" in 1971 and starred in Bunuel's "Tristana" in 1970 and 
"Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" in 1972. He won the best actor award at the 
1977 Cannes Film Festival for his role in "Elisa, My Life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps it is a pity that my success came so late in life," he told The Times 
in Madrid in 1973. "It might have been better to have been successful while 
young, like El Cordobes in the bullring. Then your life is all before you to 
enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, adversity, too, teaches you how to savor life -- like a cup of coffee 
sip by sip." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Fernando Casado Arambillet in La Coruna, Rey studied to be an architect 
-- but the Spanish Civil War intervened. He and his father, an army colonel, 
fought on the side of the Loyalists, and by the end of the war were 
impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became a movie extra just to get money to eat," he told The Times in 1987. 
"I never had that ambition to be an actor, but it was like a chain reaction. 
One day a director asked me if I could say a line, and I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Rey was dubbing Spanish voices in foreign films, beginning with Tyrone 
Power in "Lloyds of London." Later he dubbed Laurence Olivier in all the 
Briton's Shakespearean films, with Olivier becoming Rey's unknowing acting 
tutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rey portrayed romantic leads in Spanish films in the 1940s and 1950s and 
earned his first major international success with Bunuel's "Viridiana" in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for Bunuel, nobody outside Spain and South America would have 
the faintest idea who I am," Rey said in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 He made four films for the noted director including Bunuel's last, "That 
Obscure Object of Desire," in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Rey's favorite role was that of Don Lope, the elderly guardian obsessed with 
his beautiful ward, portrayed by French actress Catherine Deneuve in 
"Tristana," a study of old age. It was that role that won him the part in the 
American film "The French Connection." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Bunuel) always wanted me to play dirty old men," Rey said in 1987. "But we 
established a relationship that was very easy for me. Bunuel was so relaxing. 
Normally, when a film is finished, everybody is tired; with Bunuel you had the 
impression you had done nothing. I've seen his crew cry at the end of 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Rey is survived by his wife of 34 years, Argentine actress Mabel Karr, their 
son and daughter and four grandchildren.

LAWRENCE SPIVAK; ORIGINATOR OF 'MEET THE PRESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawrence Spivak, originator of NBC's "Meet the Press" and pioneer of 
television's Sunday news show format, died Wednesday in Washington. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
 Spivak died of congestive heart failure at Sibley Memorial Hospital, said Tim 
Russert, Washington bureau chief for NBC and the current host of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Spivak was moderator of "Meet the Press" from its beginning in November, 1947, 
until November, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the roar of the presses, working day and night in the North, South, East 
and West of our nation," Spivak said in introducing his first show, which he 
billed as "America's press conference of the air." 
</P>
<P>
 The first show was broadcast only in New York, although it was produced in 
Washington, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
 By its third broadcast, the program clearly was going to be a hit. NBC 
executives gave it network status, broadcasting it in New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early days, television journalists were reluctant to ask their 
guests hard questions, so Spivak made a special effort to be tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I wasn't beholden to anybody, I just felt that the question had to be 
asked. It just had to be fair and informative and accurate. And sometimes the 
refusal to answer becomes more significant than the answer. We just furnish an 
opportunity for a guest to make or break himself." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC said Spivak and colleague Martha Rountree began "Meet the Press" as a 
promotion for American Mercury magazine. Spivak was publisher of the periodical 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Spivak bought Rountree's interest in 1953, when she retired. Two years later, 
Spivak sold his rights to the show to NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Spivak was born in New York City on June 11, 1900. He married the former 
Charlotte Beir Ring, a psychologist, in 1924. She died in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 He graduated cum laude from Harvard University in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
 Spivak's daughter, Judith, also is deceased. His son, Jonathan, works for the 
Wall Street Journal.

LEARNING BY DOING; THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT, BUT NEW APPROACH 
SHOWS PROMISE AT SEPULVEDA MIDDLE SCHOOL 
</P>

<P>
 Open the door to Michael Zerwer's eighth-grade classroom and the noise is 
deafening. Students sit in groups rolling Slinkys along the desk tops and 
arguing loudly over earthquake waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to a science class of the '90s. It's a chaotic scene in which teachers 
don't lecture in front of chalkboards and students don't sit passively behind 
desks. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sepulveda Middle School in North Hills, Zerwer and others are trying 
different ways of teaching. Relying less on textbooks and overhead projectors, 
they are letting students work together using real objects -- like the Slinkys 
-- to figure out answers together. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in math, English and history all are trying the new approaches to 
learning, and the school has some reason to think the methods are working. 
</P>
<P>
 In results announced this week, Sepulveda scored among the top in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District on the California Learning Assessment System, a 
new series of tests given to students in fourth, eighth and 10th grades. But 
Sepulveda students didn't make it to the top when measured against tough, new 
statewide performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 In math, 84% of Sepulveda's eighth-graders scored in the lowest three levels, 
showing only limited understanding of math concepts. But in reading, 46% of the 
tested eighth-graders scored at the top three levels, showing complete 
understanding of material and demonstrating perception and thoroughness. 
</P>
<P>
 Districtwide, in math 94% of the eighth-graders scored at the bottom three 
levels. In reading, 24% scored at the top three levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The scores at Sepulveda include those of the gifted and high ability students 
who attend a magnet program on the campus. When compared to other schools that 
have similar programs, Sepulveda still comes out among the top-scoring 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Zerwer's Slinky-rolling students are examples of the way state education 
officials envision the modern classroom. They say team-teaching, hands-on 
learning with a more rigorous curriculum will earn schools higher test scores 
and produce better students. The new tests are designed to complement more 
rigorous academics. 
</P>
<P>
 Zerwer agrees. "I really feel strongly that students learn much better if they 
do things rather than just hear about them," Zerwer said. "I think they retain 
it longer and they are also having more fun doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Zerwer's students. 
</P>
<P>
 "You actually look forward to science class and don't dread going to it," said 
Avital Shavit, an eighth-grader. "We do a lot of fun assignments. It's 
interesting so I learn better." 
</P>
<P>
 The higher than average test scores were not surprising to many teachers on 
the campus, who said they expected the students to do that well. But they said 
the tests were more difficult than anticipated and that many students were not 
used to the new format. Instead of multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank exams, 
students had to support their answers in writing to many of the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just wasn't a normal testing situation," said Jane Blitz, who teaches 
English. "It was a difficult test and it was not what the kids expected. But I 
think we have to have high standards. If we lower them, we're doing our kids a 
disservice." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Margolin, a Sepulveda math teacher, said his eighth-graders were not as 
prepared for the test as they will be in coming years. He said the students are 
spending more time on word problems now and are doing more hands-on lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin said the teachers were worried about the results after they gave the 
test for the first time last spring. "We thought, 'Boy, when these scores come 
out, this district is going to look bad,' " he said. "I knew the test scores 
wouldn't be as high as they were before. I think for the majority of the 
eighth-graders that test was too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 To Rajan Bhattacharyya, a ninth-grader who remembered taking the test last 
year, it was "tricky." 
</P>
<P>
 "They worded the problems in such a way that you had to really nit-pick the 
language to understand it," he said. "It was hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Schuster, the math department chairwoman, said the tests challenged the 
students and that she doesn't believe that the scores revealed an accurate 
portrait of her students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think junior high kids are more used to fundamental tests -- addition, 
subtraction, multiplication," she said. "I know that many of my kids are bright 
and articulate but sometimes they don't do that well on a particular kind of 
test." 
</P>
<P>
 To help teachers prepare their students for next year's tests, a school 
leadership committee agreed recently to pay for training given by UCLA 
professors. 
</P>
<P>
 But some teachers are reluctant to alter their techniques, preferring instead 
to continue working behind a lectern and in front of a chalkboard. They say 
they have more control of the students who would have trouble focusing on the 
task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to gain control and stability in the classroom," said Chris Hale, a 
history teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in response to the new tests, teachers in many subject areas are giving 
students more reading and writing assignments and fewer lectures and textbooks. 
In Francine Wong-Hauptman's English class, all the students had a copy of 
Charles Dickens' "Oliver Twist" on their desks as they discussed verbs, adverbs 
and adjectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making a change for the kids and to strengthen our instructional 
program," said Bob Reimann, the school principal. "It's been a slow process but 
our teachers are ready to go. We want to bring all the scores up -- they are a 
thermometer of how well we're doing." Gompers Middle School

A TOUGH ASSIGNMENT; FOR TEACHERS AT BELEAGUERED SOUTH-CENTRAL SCHOOL, LOFTY 
GOALS TAKE A BACK SEAT TO MORE PRESSING CONCERNS

<P>
 Math teacher Derrick Anderson only vaguely remembers the three days last 
spring when he handed out California's newest assessment test to his 
eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "That math test is not even relevant to the education program here," Anderson 
said. "I get 13- and 14-year old kids who don't know their times tables, who 
can't multiply." 
</P>
<P>
 Test scores released this week show the depth of the problem at Samuel Gompers 
Middle School, where 84% of eighth-graders show limited or no mathematical 
thinking and understanding, according to the new California Learning Assessment 
System. It was among the worst math performances in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Gompers, a cluster of squat brown buildings and a towering auditorium at 
Imperial Highway and Main Street in South-Central Los Angeles, also fell near 
the bottom of scores in reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, the lowest scores were turned in by students from the 
poorest neighborhoods who were not fluent in English and whose parents have 
only limited education. 
</P>
<P>
 Gompers is a textbook case of how the complex demographics of Los Angeles come 
crashing into a classroom, overwhelming teachers who often must explain the 
difference between a noun and a verb before they can analyze a piece of 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 About 28% of the students are not fluent in English. About half of Gompers' 
1,720 students are African American and half are Latinos, the two ethnic groups 
in the district that scored the lowest on the tests designed to compare student 
performance to high statewide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 At other schools, the test scores set educators scrambling to update their 
training so teachers can impart the latest in critical thinking techniques. At 
Gompers, the staff is compelled to set other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The little money available for training teachers last year was used on a 
classroom management and discipline course. On Tuesday, instead of analyzing 
the new test scores, the issue dominating talk at a faculty meeting was school 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In a neighborhood racked by drive-by shootings and close to some of the city's 
most notorious housing projects, keeping children safe is the No. 1 concern, 
Principal Robert W. Kinsella said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously in test scores we fail," Kinsella said. "But as human beings our 
students are learning to work to their full potential. Our goal is to make sure 
we provide a safe learning environment so they can fulfill their potential." 
</P>
<P>
 At Gompers, eighth-grade math teacher Donna Quinn, the chairwoman of the 
department, has only 30 math books for her 150 students. She said that with 37 
students in her class, it is impossible to break students into groups for 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get eighth-graders who can't read and I'm giving them a CLAS math test that 
required them to read and write?" she said in exasperation. "I just don't feel 
I can do it all." 
</P>
<P>
 In another building, English teacher Randy Valentine was signing mid-term 
failure notices for 15 of his 35 students. New vocabulary words filled the 
chalk-board: caress, pierce, halt, interrogate.  
</P>
<P>
 His goal this semester is to teach his eighth-graders how to write an essay 
off the top of their heads -- and worry about the nuances of grammar and 
punctuation later. The first steps have been learning to construct paragraphs 
based on class discussions of a book, most recently one on Helen Keller. 
</P>
<P>
 A verbatim sample of a student paragraph that received a B-plus: 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginig of the Book I read. And I found out that in the Book their is 
a yung girl named Helen Keler She has A Father a Mother and I think one of the 
brothers name is James . . . They send for a person who mite try to teach Helen 
something's . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS test his students took last year required eighth-graders to write in 
a purposeful, coherent and focused manner and show a variety of sentence 
structures and good control of grammar, punctuation and capitalization to score 
in the top levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine was angered by the results of CLAS tests showing that 55% of his 
students can only partially meet the demands of writing assignments and compose 
disorganized, undeveloped and difficult-to-understand texts. 
</P>
<P>
 "These scores portray them as idiots. They are anything but idiots," Valentine 
said. "What it indicates is laziness. They don't have the discipline to take a 
test like that. They are not any less intelligent. They are in a social 
condition where they view (the test) apathetically." Sepulveda Middle School

RAP SINGER ARRESTED IN SLAYING; CRIME: TERRY GRAY IS SECOND MEMBER OF THE GROUP 
DA LENCH MOB TO BE HELD IN A KILLING. HE DENIES INVOLVEMENT IN SHOOTING AT 
BOWLING ALLEY.

<P>
 A member of the Los Angeles "gangsta rap" trio Da Lench Mob has been arrested 
on suspicion of murder in a slaying last month at a bowling alley in the Athens 
area, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Gray, 24, who goes by the stage name T-Bone, is the second member of the 
hit rap group to be arrested on suspicion of murder since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Sheriff's Department spokeswoman said murder charges could be 
filed as early as today against Gray, who was arrested Tuesday. Witnesses have 
identified Gray as the gunman who burst into the Southwest Bowl on Feb. 18 and 
fatally shot Herbert Battle and wounded Lashann Townsend, both 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The other member of Da Lench Mob arrested in connection with a killing, DaSean 
Laron Cooper, 25, is scheduled to be arraigned in Torrance on March 21. He is 
charged with murder in the unrelated shooting death in June of a 22-year-old 
man in the Athens area near Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's attorney, Anthony Alexander, acknowledged that the rapper was at the 
bowling alley the night of the murder, but said his client left "long before 
shooting erupted." 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry Gray did not murder anyone," Alexander said. "They arrested the wrong 
man. Terry wasn't even in the building when it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies served a search warrant Tuesday at the Athens area residence where 
Gray resides. The house in the 11600 block of Western Avenue near the Southeast 
Bowl is owned by Gray's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 After arresting Gray, investigators seized several handguns in search of the 
weapon used in the killing. The weapons were being analyzed by the Sheriff's 
Department crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the rapper said deputies also confiscated "reams of rap 
lyrics" from the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gray's attorney said his client is six inches shorter than the 
gunman, homicide detectives said several people identified Gray as the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Da Lench Mob rose to prominence in 1992 with the release of "Guerillas in tha 
Mist," an album produced and co-written by controversial Los Angeles rap star 
Ice Cube, who has been criticized for writing music promoting violence against 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 The album -- which included the single "Freedom Got an A.K." -- has generated 
more than $6 million in sales since its release on Ice Cube's Street Knowledge 
label, which is distributed by Time Warner-owned EastWest Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice Cube and representatives for Street Knowledge declined comment on the 
case. Other members in the rap community were shocked by the news of his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This almost seems impossible to me," said James Bernard, senior editor of the 
Source, the nation's leading hip-hop music journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Dennis Hunt contributed to this story. Rap's Troubles As 
the battle over gangsta rap's social impact heats up on Capitol Hill, several 
of the multimillion-dollar genre's stars are about to enter courtrooms in Los 
Angeles to face charges ranging from assault to murder.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; $3.5 
MILLION SOUGHT FOR SCHOOL SECURITY OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles schools Supt. Sid Thompson called on the Board of Education to 
spend $3.5 million to hire 22 more school police officers and retain 300 campus 
security aides as part of a program to prevent violence unveiled this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson recommended that school principals work with teachers and parents to 
devise a safety plan that includes anti-violence curriculum as well as safety 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education praised the initiatives and several members said they 
will push hard to allocate money for the safety officers during upcoming budget 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how we can afford not to do this," school board member Mark 
Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the additional school police, an officer will be assigned to every 
district high school and middle school. Because of state funding cuts, the 
district must come up with $2.3 million to continue its campus security aide 
program.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN GETS 
10 YEARS FOR SHOOTING AT MCA BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ex-employee who pleaded guilty to firing dozens of shots at the MCA 
corporate headquarters in Universal City last year was sentenced Wednesday to 
10 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
 John Brian Jarvis, 58, pleaded guilty Feb. 9 to seven counts of assault with a 
deadly weapon and two counts of firing at an occupied building.In a plea 
bargain, Superior Court Judge John Reid sentenced Jarvis to a third of the term 
he could have faced.  
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis, occasionally sipping liquor, calmly aimed a high-powered rifle at the 
MCA World Headquarters building April 20, authorities said. The company had 
fired him in 1986 from his part-time job as a driver. Jarvis reportedly saw 
that as the move that ruined his life, and police said he had thought about 
shooting up the building for years.  
</P>
<P>
 He also used the scope-equipped rifle to fire at a Bank of America building 
next door. The rampage lasted about 10 minutes from a vantage point a few 
hundred yards west of the high-rises. Two women in the MCA building were hit in 
the arm by bullet fragments, and six other women were taken to hospitals for 
treatment of cuts caused by flying glass.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON; TEACHERS 
THREATEN STRIKE IF SALARIES ARE CUT BY 4% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Compton teachers have threatened to strike if the school district goes through 
with plans to cut their salaries by 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers, members of the Compton Education Assn., approved a strike by an 
overwhelming vote this week, but have not set a date, union President Margie 
Garrett said.The union held a demonstration Tuesday at a restaurant parking lot 
to protest the proposed cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The district plans to use substitutes to keep schools open if the teachers 
walk out, spokeswoman Arianna Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they asked employees to accept lower wages because of 
the district's dire financial condition. The Compton school system was taken 
over by the state last year after becoming insolvent. Officials laid off 111 
non-teaching workers last year.

REPORT URGES REFORM OF OVERTIME FOR CITY OFFICIALS; FINANCES: HEAD 
ADMINISTRATOR SAYS DWP PAYMENTS ARE MOST TROUBLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Department of Water and Power, which has repeatedly come under fire in 
recent years for its spending practices, took another hit Wednesday with a 
report criticizing its overtime payments to top executives.  
</P>
<P>
 The report by City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie said that Los Angeles 
city government as a whole needs to overhaul its system for dispensing overtime 
to its highest-paid executives. However, the report added, it must tread 
carefully to avoid legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, the report found, was most troubling at the DWP, where overtime 
payments far exceed all other civilian departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city utility has more than 400 salaried employees who earn more than 
$70,000 a year and then collect an average of $4,500 in overtime. That is more 
than six times the overtime average of $745 for supervisors in all other 
departments except for the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department's overtime bill for battalion chiefs and assistant chiefs 
-- $16,894 per official -- was even higher than the DWP's. But the report says 
the overtime was caused by the department's unique 24-hour staffing 
requirements and contends that it is cheaper to pay the overtime than to hire 
more fire officials to work the round-the-clock shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is not the first to take the DWP to task for alleged extravagances. 
Although the city-owned utility is defended by its backers as a source of 
revenue for Los Angeles, its critics in recent years have made political hay 
over the big-spending ways of the department's management. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, for instance, members of the City Council called for an audit 
after it was learned that DWP supervisors running the department during a 
strike ran up $281,000 worth of catering bills, and sent out for another 
$125,000 worth of danishes, muffins, cookies and pies. In 1991, the city 
controller -- a longstanding critic of the department -- criticized the DWP for 
sloppy accounting of its petty cash and travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, then-Mayor Tom Bradley toughened travel policies for the department 
after disclosures that the then-DWP general manager had chartered a jet to 
Sacramento for $2,800 when much cheaper commercial flights were available -- a 
practice later revealed to be routine. And in 1989, half a dozen members of the 
department made headlines when they dined with their spouses at the Sheraton 
Grand Hotel and tried to charge the $879 tab to their expense accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was excess in a different department that triggered the most 
recent round of criticism. The overtime report was commissioned in 1992 when it 
was discovered that a top city management analyst, James D. Bisetti, had 
received $95,000 in overtime over a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bisetti's situation was called "a blatant aberration" -- he resigned 
from his $86,000-a-year position under pressure -- the report recommends a 
citywide effort to reduce overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever changes the city suggests in overtime rules must comply with a host 
of Fair Labor Standard Act requirements that have been hashed out over the 
years in lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The union representing the city's top fire officials won a suit declaring them 
"hourly" and not "salaried" employees and thus entitling them to overtime pay 
at the rate of time and a half. Supervisors in other city departments are also 
seeking the right to overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference on Wednesday, Councilman Joel Wachs condemned the DWP and 
called for a halt to what he called "widespread and shocking abuse" of overtime 
at the utility. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP officials say they have already begun efforts to trim overtime costs.

GM PLANT SALE EFFORT STILL STUCK IN 1ST GEAR; REDEVELOPMENT: A CITY PLAN TO BUY 
THE SITE AND BROKER A DEAL HAS GONE NOWHERE. TAX BREAKS COULD ENTICE THE AUTO 
MAKER TO LOWER ITS PRICE. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite offers by the city of Los Angeles to broker the sale of the vacant 
General Motors plant in Panorama City, efforts to find a buyer for the 100-acre 
plant to help spur economic renewal continue to falter, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 High-level city officials have floated offers to buy the GM plant so the city 
can use its financial backing and tax breaks to make the facility more 
affordable to a new buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan to have the city play middleman in the sale has not been viable 
because neither GM nor the city has been able to attract a serious buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose district includes the plant and who has 
been working for months to find a new occupant, said the city would purchase 
the plant only if a serious buyer were prepared to take it over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always felt that there was an opportunity to use the city or some 
other vehicle as a pass-through to reduce the price," he said. "(But) we really 
need a third-party investor." 
</P>
<P>
 GM spokesman Peter Ternes said the company and city officials have had 
numerous discussions about the plant since it closed in August, 1992, but he 
said the sides are no closer today to signing an agreement than they were 18 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ternes declined to reveal the price that GM has discussed with the city or 
comment on reports that the city has offered between $5 million and $10 million 
for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The selling price depends on how the buyer wants to use the facility. There 
are a lot of factors that will influence the price," Ternes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on Van Nuys Boulevard near Saticoy Street, the plant was once the 
symbol of the region's manufacturing might. The facility's assembly line 
produced 6.3 million cars over 45 years, most notably Camaros and Firebirds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it closed, eliminating 2,600 jobs and further depressing the San 
Fernando Valley's economy, Alarcon and other high-level city officials have met 
with GM officials to discuss incentives that would draw a new manufacturing 
firm to the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But the size of the facility, a potential ground-soil contamination problem 
and the deteriorating condition of the 71,000-square-foot plant have made it 
difficult to market. 
</P>
<P>
 One way the city can attract potential buyers is to offer GM a substantial tax 
break if it sells the site to the city at a below-market price. The city would 
then offer the plant to a third party at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Stein, a special adviser to Mayor Richard Riordan who has been involved in 
trying to speed the plant sale for several weeks, declined to say how close the 
city has come to buying the site, except that the mayor "has been proactive in 
attempting to purchase the property for the purpose of facilitating the 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 But others were more blunt about the plant's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Ternes said, "There hasn't been a lot of earnest interest" in the site since 
it was put up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Cushman-Wakefield, the firm hired by GM to market the property, listed it at 
$50 million in April, 1993. Todd Lorver, a Grubb & Ellis commercial property 
broker, said his company appraised the facility at $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city gets in there and is willing to provide economic assistance to 
users, it can be a viable site, but it's going to take a substantial 
investment," Lorver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorver also questioned reports that GM could receive a sizable tax break by 
selling the closed facility to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "GM would have to be manufacturing something there in order to take a tax 
credit. I don't see how this can happen unless there is some special accounting 
done at the state level," Lorver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said a serious offer was made for the plant several months ago by a 
major corporation for use as a distribution center. But he said the deal fell 
through, though he declined to provide details, and no other serious offers 
have come forward.

POISON UNDERFOOT; OFFICIALS WILL TEST YARDS OF UP TO 100 HOMES NEAR TORRANCE 
AFTER FINDING HIGH LEVELS OF PESTICIDE DDT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A streamer of yellow caution tape encircles the lush green vegetable garden 
belonging to Cynthia Babich, who learned last week that soil tests in her yard 
near Torrance had detected the banned pesticide DDT at a level roughly 2.5 
times higher than that considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing in a neighbor's yard found even higher levels of the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the EPA will conduct soil tests in the yards of up to 100 homes 
in an unincorporated neighborhood east of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency plans to excavate most of the two yards where the DDT was found. 
The source of the DDT is not known, and EPA officials say that while it may be 
an isolated occurrence, they want to be sure that other homes are not affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Babich said she has been told that she will be moved out of her house for 
about a week while the work is done, probably in early April.  
</P>
<P>
 Babich said she was stunned by the news, especially since testing last fall 
had found much lower DDT levels. Officials tested the earth again as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT is a poison that kills insects by affecting their nervous systems. It is 
suspected of causing cancer in humans and damages the reproduction of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "That breaks my heart. That's my garden," said Babich, who was notified of the 
test results last week, just as she finished turning the soil for spring 
planting, placing broccoli seedlings and moving strawberry plants. 
</P>
<P>
 She criticized government officials for not doing more extensive testing 
earlier in her neighborhood, which lies just south of a hazardous-waste dump 
and east of the Montrose Chemical Corp., a federal Superfund site. The area is 
southwest of the intersection of the San Diego and Harbor freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Babich and her neighbors, complaining of strange rashes, nausea and other 
physical ailments, are calling for faster cleanup of hazardous-waste dumps in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been 10 years doing nothing -- testing, testing, testing," said Marla 
Frame, who lives with her children three doors away from Babich on West 204th 
Street and who said she was deeply alarmed to hear about the results of testing 
in Babich's yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could have swept me off with a broom. I didn't think it would be that 
high," Frame said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA tests found DDT levels of 245 parts per million in Babich's yard and 
606 p.p.m. in a neighbor's yard. Federal officials recommend taking precautions 
when DDT concentrations exceed 100 p.p.m., and recent changes in how human risk 
is assessed could lead to more stringent standards. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA representatives emphasize that the high DDT test results may simply 
indicate an isolated deposit of the pesticide -- a "hot spot," as one official 
described it -- and that other yards may not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Although EPA officials say they are perplexed about the source of the 
pesticide, Babich is convinced that it migrated from Montrose, where DDT was 
once produced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental officials say the answer may not be that easy, pointing out that 
the neighborhood was once an agricultural area and that DDT was widely used by 
farmers before most uses were banned in the United States in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not hopeful that we will ever determine that the DDT came from the 
Montrose site," said Nancy Woo, the site's EPA project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the new DDT findings, however, the federal agency is planning to 
test soil at more homes in two residential areas -- Babich's neighborhood and a 
second area west of the Montrose site. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Wednesday how many homes would be affected, but Woo said the 
first phase of testing could include up to 100. The results could determine if 
the investigation will expand further. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials will discuss the testing and other community concerns at a March 
22 public meeting at the Halldale Avenue School auditorium, 21514 Halldale 
Ave., Los Angeles. There will be an open house from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. and the 
public meeting from 7 to 9:30 p.m.

SBA LOWERS REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration revised its regulations Wednesday to make 
many smaller and mid-size businesses damaged by the Northridge earthquake 
eligible for low-interest loans exceeding $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA raised its loan cap for firms with as few as 250 employees. 
Previously, most employers had to have more than 1,000 workers to qualify for 
loans of more than $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also lowered a second criterion for large loans. A business that 
employed 10% of the entire work force from a given industry in a disaster area 
could qualify previously; the SBA modified that threshold to 5% of an 
industry's work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses meeting these criteria -- which makes them a "major source of 
employment" -- can receive unlimited loans if the money is needed to remain 
open or to reopen. The program is intended to avoid substantial unemployment in 
a disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest rate can be as low as 4% and the loans can be repaid over a 
period as long as 30 years. The business must have exhausted all of its own 
money and available credit to be eligible for a loan of more than $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised regulation was made retroactive to cover any disaster since Jan. 
1. It will apply to future disasters that qualify for SBA assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude 6.8 quake inflicted major losses on inventory and serious 
structural damage to thousands of businesses throughout the Los Angeles region. 
Business representatives, municipal officials and legislators had sought to 
ease the requirements for higher loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Kulik, assistant SBA administrator for disaster assistance, said that 
the change reflects "recognition of the fact that the 1,000 limit was rather 
high." He said the issue was brought to the attention of SBA Administrator 
Erskine B. Bowles by various businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulik said he did not know how many additional companies will be eligible for 
the larger loans or how many would apply for them. But he described the number 
of those seeking aid in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 temblor as "just 
incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA has received 90,000 applications for loans from businesses and 
homeowners, and the numbers continue to rise. The agency was given lending 
authority of more than $1.1 billion in the emergency aid bill passed by 
Congress.

RETARDED WOMAN'S STERILIZATION GRANTED AFTER FOUR PREGNANCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mentally impaired woman who has been pregnant four times in two years was 
granted her request Wednesday to be sterilized to avoid future pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who is nine months' pregnant, will be sterilized after she gives 
birth by Cesarean section to her second child today or Friday, said Erie County 
Surrogate Court Judge Joseph Mattina. 
</P>
<P>
 His decision came after two attorneys appointed by the court to look after the 
woman's interests gave up their challenge to the sterilization. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old woman and her parents had asked for the sterilization, and 
Mattina approved it Friday. But attorneys Herbert Siegel and Brian Welsh 
appealed the decision to the Appellate Division of New York Supreme Court, 
which put the sterilization on hold Tuesday and ordered Mattina to review the 
case further. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel said testimony from several doctors and mental health experts at a 
hearing Wednesday convinced him and Welsh that sterilization is in the woman's 
best interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, whose name was not released, has an IQ of about 65. She has been 
unable to control her sexual behavior and sterilization is the only way to 
prevent her from getting pregnant, said Susan Gray, an attorney for the woman 
and her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Barnowski, a mental health expert who has interviewed the woman, said 
she lacks the judgment to raise a child and has psychological and behavioral 
problems that could make her a threat to children. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman plans to give her baby up for adoption. She has a 14-month-old son 
being cared for by her mother. Her other two pregnancies ended in miscarriages.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: DOING THEIR PART TO ELIMINATE SADDLE SORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are definitely living in horse country. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jeff Alexander, owner of the TO Corral and a member of the Conejo 
Open Space Trails Advisory Committee, there are 2,500 horses in the Conejo 
Valley alone, and he estimates that there may be as many as 30,000 countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Where there are horses, there are saddles. And, sadly, where there are 
saddles, there are saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, here in Ventura County, where a good saddle can make all the 
difference to a cowboy who'd actually like to sit down when he gets home, 
saddle makers take great pride in their work. 
</P>
<P>
 It's painstaking and potentially painful work as staff writer Pancho Doll 
discovered while researching this week's cover story. When cutting hide, saddle 
makers sometimes slice their own as well as the cow's. They also sew 
themselves, puncture themselves and even glue themselves back together. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the fun part, at least for 81-year-old George Randall of Ojai, a 
longstanding saddle maker whose most distinguished work, according to his 
clients and colleagues, are braided rawhide bosals (used instead of a bit), 
reins and riatas (rawhide lariat). 
</P>
<P>
 Making a bosal, he told Doll, is tedious work that he does with little more 
than a pocketknife and a pair of locking pliers. To make the string, he takes a 
prepared hide, starts at the outside edge and cuts a strip the width of a 
shoestring, round and round, until he reaches the center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Randall isn't complaining. According to Doll, he seems to be quite 
attached to his craft, and even to the animals who gave their lives to be horse 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 "During my visit with the saddle maker," Doll said, "he pointed to a fine 
bosal he had made and said, 'That's from a little old gray Brahma that up and 
died on me. That must have been in '55.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And that's no bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Ventura County Life, both Earthwatch columnist Richard Kahlenberg 
and Josef Woodard, who writes on architecture in his monthly Structures column, 
take a look at the changing face of downtown Fillmore after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 And while they are rebuilding in Fillmore, they'll be re-enacting at Lake 
Casitas in Ojai, as several hundred volunteers and assorted other Civil War 
buffs exchange musket fire and historical anecdotes as the Yankees and the 
Confederates once again slog it out. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure a good saddle could make all the difference.

EARTHWATCH: TEMPORARY BUILDINGS, LASTING LIVES; THE 'INSTANT MALL' IN 
QUAKE-DAMAGED FILLMORE WILL BE USED ELSEWHERE. MULTIPLE USES ARE PLANNED FOR 
SOME NEW STRUCTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Big ticket recycling has arrived. This month a Times special section detailed 
how it's happening with automobiles, and this week in Fillmore I encountered 
some examples in the building industry. In both cases, corporations are 
intentionally building their products to be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking about grinding up BMWs or quake-damaged chimneys for scrap 
iron or paving material -- although that certainly is better than landfilling 
them. This is about building cars or structures that can be taken apart and put 
back together in new ways, depending on changing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The "instant mall" that has been erected to put the displaced merchants of 
Fillmore's main street back in business is one case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is exciting for several reasons. For one, it has gone up with 
remarkable speed, and for another, the new site is becoming a sort of tourist 
attraction -- and a commercial success. 
</P>
<P>
 But most exciting of all is that the structure, though temporary, will be used 
again and again. What you see now, manufactured by a company called Sprung 
Instant Structures Ltd., will be removed intact when the merchants return to 
permanent quarters and reused somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, to the east of the temporary site, which is at Main Street and 
Central Avenue, the Fillmore Redevelopment Agency is going to erect some new 
buildings. Some of them will look like the citrus packing sheds that dot the 
Fillmore landscape, but will, for the foreseeable future, be used as stores and 
offices. And an old train depot will be brought over for use as a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is that, whether new or old, these are buildings that will change 
their use as the needs and demands of downtown Fillmore change. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is very practical and resourceful," said J. Anthony Perez, 
Fillmore's associate city planner. "But we can't predict what's going to happen 
in five years. It would be very shortsighted to consider only the second or 
third use of a building." 
</P>
<P>
 Second or third use? There was a time when planners and architects didn't 
think beyond a first use; a bank was a bank, a barn was a barn. Now people like 
Perez are thinking about the seventh, eighth or maybe, the 20th use of a 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the city chose the plan of Main Street Architects, a Ventura 
County-based firm, in a recent design competition for the site, which is 
sometimes called The Railroad Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 According to John Deitsch, a principal in the firm, the idea was to create 
spaces that could be used any number of ways over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very little of what we build these days is permanently used" for its initial 
purpose, Deitsch said. "We have to think outside the box -- the normal 
parameters." 
</P>
<P>
 (Deitsch's firm led the design effort that brought a group of farmhouses into 
downtown Oxnard and turned them into offices and stores to give the place a 
"downtown.") 
</P>
<P>
 Another example of the firm's handiwork is the installation of new recyclable 
structures on the Cal State Northridge campus. 
</P>
<P>
 I like to see these manufactured, factory-built structures given more use 
because they are extremely economical with regard to raw materials usage -- the 
construction process cuts to one-10th the waste of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The CSUN structures will be removed and reused someday. In contrast, at Santa 
Monica City College, according to its president, Richard Moore, they're hoping 
to keep their temporary earthquake-replacement buildings for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sort of getting to be that permanent, new buildings are temporary, while 
temporary structures are being used for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jean Garth of the architecture firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer 
Associates, this trend in flexible building is being considered in the building 
designs for the proposed Cal State University campus in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want buildings that are like dinosaurs that don't change," said 
Garth. By initially designing buildings that can easily be adapted to an 
entirely new purpose, "we save almost the entire expense of a new building," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the environmental movement, this is an example of the slogan "reduce, 
reuse, recycle." In the architecture business they've condensed the idea into 
one word: rethink. Details 
</P>
<P>

practices, attend the Workshop On Urban Design being keynoted by William 
Fulton, editor of the Ventura-based publication California Planning & 
Development Report. Call (310) 967-4255 for information on the March 21 event

STRUCTURES; VISITORS ARE IN FOR A SHOCK -- AS FILLMORE WAS JAN. 17; HISTORIC 
DOWNTOWN IS LARGELY BOARDED UP; BUILDINGS ARE IN VARYING STAGES OF 
HABITABILITY. BUT THERE'S A SENSE OF A TOWN IN RECOVERY. 
</P>

 A brightly hued brochure from the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce describes the 
town, and not deceptively, as "the home of blue skies, orange groves, clear 
air, star-studded nights and small-town values." Today, both the Chamber of 
Commerce office and the office of the Fillmore Herald are closed -- civic hubs 
rendered unusable by a seismic act of God. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't been to Fillmore lately, chances are that you're in for a 
shock, as was this humble town on the early morning of Jan. 17. Of all the 
towns in Ventura County, it was Fillmore that took the worst beating in that 
6.8 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even casual observation reveals a town turned asunder. There are no apparent 
signs of destruction visible as you drive down California 126, with its 
faceless strip-mall franchises still intact. The problem lies where it counts 
most, as you turn onto Central Avenue, the heart of the old town. 
</P>
<P>
 That once-charming downtown area is now largely boarded up, its crumbled 
facades bandaged behind scaffolding that keeps pedestrians out of harm's way. 
All over town, red, green and yellow tags from building inspectors are 
displayed in windows, indicating degrees of habitability. 
</P>
<P>
 All is not lost. The south side of Central is flanked by two notable historic 
structures, still standing and suddenly taking on symbolic importance. The 
Italianate former Fillmore State Bank, built by Albert C. Martin in 1917, was 
unscathed. At the opposite end of the block stands the impressive former 
Farmers & Merchants Bank, built in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 But between these stalwart bookends, several buildings have been red-tagged 
and closed to public access. The sight is a sad one, but humor has its day too. 
The Up In Arms store is boarded up, with "Gone Fishing" scrawled in big letters 
on plywood. Across the street, too, many buildings sit in varying states of 
ruin, while demolition is well under way on others. 
</P>
<P>
 At the actual and sentimental heart of the destruction is the condemned 
theater, "The Show," built in 1915 and one of the last remaining independent 
small-town theaters in Southern California. The debilitated florist shop, 
connected to the theater building, now sits behind a pile of brick and debris, 
with a sign in the window reading "Delivering flowers. I'll be back in a 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a long moment. The "Notice and Order" from the city of Fillmore 
attached to the theater tells all: "East wall has partially collapsed and 
supports the roof structure . . . the front and side parapets partial failure . 
. . marquee in partial collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Partial collapse is as functional a term as any to describe what's happened in 
Fillmore. More than half the businesses in the historic one-block stretch of 
Central have been crippled by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's also a sense of this being a town in recovery, with a stubborn 
will to survive. That very marquee in partial collapse now reads "The Best Town 
Ever." 
</P>
<P>
 One sure sign of recovery is the huge temporary structure, a makeshift 
emporium with a space-age ambience, which has been erected at the entrance to 
the old town area. This long twin-peaked, onion-shaped structure will provide a 
place of business for those put out by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Northridge quake has radically altered the face of Fillmore, this 
was not the first instance of earthquake damage here. In the 1971 Sylmar quake, 
registering 6.3 on the Richter scale, pieces of an upstairs wall of the Briggs 
Hardware building tumbled onto the adjacent Martha's and collapsed the roof. 
That isolated incident proved to be a hint of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was that very aspect of Fillmore's charm -- the historic 
small-town atmosphere -- that also contributed to its downfall. If there's a 
lesson here, it has to do with the perils of brick-and-mortar structures in a 
seismically sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Fillmore's earthquake damage more dramatic, in one sense, than the 
damage closer to the Northridge epicenter is the blow to the unity of its 
architectural and historical character. Whereas the San Fernando Valley, 
because of its sprawl, has had trouble maintaining a cohesive identity, 
Fillmore has had the advantage of being a small town blissfully apart from the 
urban reality. 
</P>
<P>
 That was especially true of Central Avenue. Now, that block, once a bastion of 
archival architecture dating back to the period between 1910 and 1920, when the 
biggest building boom occurred, has suffered a serious blow. The inevitable 
incursion of strip-mall elements and fast-food joints on California 126 has 
threatened to chip away at the singular character of this railroad town, one 
that never got co-opted into the suburban mesh of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Little more than a month after the shake, the story of the fall and the rise 
of Fillmore continues. Along with that process, its sense of identity is put to 
the test by unforeseen circumstances.

 Three books have hit my desk recently, written by local authors or containing 
chapters about Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 An oddly titled biography, "Are Clowns Hatched?" by Mildred Runyon, is based 
on the life of her husband Charles (Chucko the Birthday Clown) Runyon. The 
world of clowning, Chucko's years as a television personality in the 1950s and 
their involvement with the famous Jungleland, "Home of Animal Stars" in 
Thousand Oaks, are lovingly remembered. Lots of photographs in the book bring 
back memories of the early days of television in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Common Voices Other Lives," an anthology of gay and lesbian writings and art, 
has just been released by Fithian Press of Santa Barbara. Edited by Jim Cook, 
the anthology features poetry, stories, art and photographs by Ventura and 
Santa Barbara residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate and propaganda around the health-care issue continues to escalate. 
Dr. Donald G. Lindsay of Ventura offers his own plan for quality medical care 
in his recently published book, "Medical Cost Crisis! A Solution Before It's 
Too Late." The guide is available at bookstores or by calling 800-345-0096.

 Therapist Geoff Buckley will deal with the emotional health of writers and 
artists in his talk on "The Moods, Magic and Madness of the Creative 
Personality" at tonight's meeting of the National League of American Pen 
Women/Simi Valley Chapter. Buckley, who is an artist and Presbyterian minister, 
will explain how creative people can cope with periodic feelings of melancholy, 
isolation and despair. The event begins at 8 p.m. at 1756 Erringer Road, Simi 
Valley. The fee for guests is $5. Call 495-5816 for details. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Book titles, like newspaper headlines, are written to catch the eye and draw 
in the reader. Anne Perry's "The Hyde Park Headsman" is a good example. Perry 
will sign her book at noon Sunday at Mysteries to Die For, 2940 Thousand Oaks 
Blvd., Thousand Oaks.

 The Gallery 9 Artists Cooperative is hosting author readings and signings from 
2 to 5 p.m. Sunday at 29020 Agoura Road, Agoura Hills. Eve Caram, whose latest 
book is "Wintershine," and Cathleen Long, former editor of the Sculpture 
Gardens Review, will read from their works. Both authors are published in 
numerous literary magazines. Call (818) 597-9629 for details.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: FIDDLE COMPETITION TO SHOWCASE SKILLS OF YOUNG AND OLD; ANNUAL 
EVENT AT OAK VIEW COMMUNITY CENTER WILL FEATURE LOTS OF OLD-FASHIONED, 
DOWN-HOME MUSIC.

<P>
 If you enjoy traditional American folk and country-Western music, the Oak View 
Community Center is the place to be Sunday for the Eighth Annual Old Time 
Amateur Fiddle Contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by District 8 of the California State Old-Time Fiddler's Assn., this 
year's contest again promises to be lots of fun, with contestants ranging in 
age from 5 to 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Where else could you see little kids take the same stage as master musicians 
such as 71-year-old Rae Huffman, a former "State Ladies Fiddle Champion," and 
Marv Johnson, 81, the current "State and National Senior Senior Fiddle 
Champion"? 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it here," said Charl Ann Gastineau, violin teacher and member of the 
Acousticats, a popular Progressive Blue Grass group. "The Old-Time Fiddlers set 
a wonderful standard for the children. And they are like second grandparents to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first-time contestants will be 10-year-old Amy Donahue of Camarillo, 
who has been Gastineau's student for about 18 months. "I enjoy playing fiddle 
because the music is bouncy. And I like to dance too," Amy said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the most out of the day, try to arrive for the children's competition, 
which ends at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1974, the musicians and fans in District 8, one of 13 in the state, have 
gathered twice a month to play, sing and dance among a casual country 
camaraderie of lively acoustic music. An electrified band, complete with pedal 
steel guitar, is usually set up in an adjoining room for swing enthusiasts. Or 
you could visit the covered patio to learn a few toe-tapping licks while 
jamming with other musicians. And under the trees out back you may find some 
folks playing and enjoying bluegrass music.

 Truman Bridges, 68, plays banjo in the club's Old Country Trio Plus One, which 
makes many public appearances. Awhile back, he told me that most fans of 
country music play several stringed instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joe Hunsinger, the club's president, is content to just play the fiddle. 
It symbolizes the attainment of a goal he set himself nine years ago when heart 
disease was diagnosed. Since becoming a heart transplant recipient nearly two 
years ago, the 56-year-old corporate vice president has mastered the fiddle and 
won a dance contest with his wife, Luana. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunsinger stressed the importance of the fiddle in perpetuating the musical 
tradition of reels, jigs and ballads brought from the British Isles. "But you 
will also hear mainstream country tunes by Hank Williams Sr. and Bob Wills at 
the meetings. And also a favorite of the children called 'Bile Them Cabbages 
Down,' " he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old-Time Fiddlers also play a lot of current country hits. And seniors 
Chuck and Ruth Sitton have started teaching line dances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is to preserve and perpetuate old-time music," said founding 
member Ben Chapman. So the association's rules require a fiddle player be 
included in any group taking the stage. But he said a majority of District 8's 
400 members don't even play an instrument. "We call them 'enthusiasts,' " said 
Chapman with a smile. "They come to listen and dance." 
</P>

 K-Hay listeners, have you been listening for Bob Allen's night-time request 
and dedication show, Santa Fe Cafe, without success? That's because since 
Tuesday Allen has taken over the early week-day afternoon drive-time slot at 
KKUR 105.5 FM, Ventura County's new country radio station. Late Monday evening, 
the Ventura-based station dropped its "adult contemporary" format. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're changing to what has been known as 'Hot Country.' But we're calling it 
'Thunder Country,' " said spokeswoman Lisa Sutherland. "We're going to play the 
hottest, newest, high-energy country music of today, 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 A second country radio station in our area comes as no surprise. Country music 
is the fastest-growing music format in America. It has more than doubled its 
audience in the past five years. But, of course, most of your folks were 
"country before country was cool."

THEATER REVIEW; 'STAR-SPANGLED GIRL' RETUNED FOR THE '90S; REFERENCES TO 
COMPUTERS AND AIDS ADD A CONTEMPORARY TONE TO THE '60S COMEDY THAT MIXES 
POLITICS AND ROMANCE.

<P>
 In his current production of Neil Simon's "The Star-Spangled Girl," director 
David Douglas attempts to bring Simon's 1967 sensibilities into the present. 
</P>
<P>
 While the changes don't hurt anything, nobody's going to confuse this with 
David Mamet. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is in production at the Ojai Art Center Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Cobart and Norman Cornell share a San Francisco apartment, also 
headquarters for "Fallout," a small leftist political magazine they publish. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments into the play, a newcomer moves in next door: Sophie Rauschmeyer. Just 
in from Little Rock, she's a former Olympic swimmer who's engaged to a Marine 
stationed at Camp Pendleton. But shortly after introducing herself to the two 
men, Norman, who writes the magazine, develops a full-out crush on her. 
High-jinks ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 While on the surface it's a simple enough (and sporadically amusing) comedy, 
the years and director Douglas have lent some texture to Simon's work. Back in 
'68, for instance, Norman's pursuit of Sophie -- watching her through a 
telescope and following her to work -- might have seemed to reflect an innocent 
infatuation; today he would very likely be turned in to the police as a 
stalker. 
</P>
<P>
 And make no mistake, the play has been updated: Douglas has inserted 
references to computers, Tonya Harding and AIDS. Also, in this production, 
Norman and Andy appear old enough to be Sophie's father -- probably an accident 
of casting rather than an attempt at significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Friedlander and Rodman Castleberry portray Andy and Norman as a couple of 
old fussbudgets; politically, they're more like leftover '30s Communists than 
members of the '60s radical left. (One might question whether bringing these 
politics into the '90s is even appropriate.) Jennifer Jennings brings fire to 
"The Star-Spangled Girl" as Sophie, who is staunchly independent though 
politically conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacing is everything in a play like this, and last Friday night's performance 
-- the cast's third before the public -- faltered a bit, especially in some 
clumsy sound effects cues. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, this "Star-Spangled Girl" provides a diverting enough evening's 
entertainment, and kindles the desire to see future work, especially by 
Jennings and director Douglas. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Star-Spangled Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m., though March 26. Also 2 p.m. Sunday 
and March 20. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ojai Art Center Theater, 113 S. Montgomery St., Ojai.

THEATER REVIEW; TAKING COMIC ROUTE TO THE SOUTH OF 1861; ANGELA WAYNE 
RANDAZZO'S 'TIME FOR MURDER' PLACES A 1994 NEW JERSEY COUPLE INTO A CIVIL 
WAR-ERA IMBROGLIO. 
</P>

<P>
 Take Al and Peg Bundy from TV's "Married . . . with Children" back in time to 
the Civil War-era South, and you've got an idea of the juxtaposition in "Time 
for Murder," a comedy by local playwright Angela Wayne Randazzo ending this 
weekend at the Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry and Maxine Eastman, tourists from East Orange, N.J., are visiting the 
antebellum Louisiana mansion that is Maxine's ancestral home, when they're 
suddenly and inexplicably whisked back from 1994 to 1861, straight into a 
highly charged dramatic situation. Lucinda Benhorn is about to have a baby, but 
her father -- Col. Jedediah Benhorn -- keeps shooting her boyfriends to death 
in an effort to preserve what's left of the family honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that what happens to the Benhorn family line will directly affect 
Maxine, the 1990s couple embroil themselves in the 1860s imbroglio. 
</P>
<P>
 Science fiction buffs have developed a set of strict time-travel conventions, 
none more inflexible than that messing with the past ensures dire and 
widespread consequences for the present. Don't expect these laws to be followed 
here (the fact that Maxine is alive in the first place indicates that 
everything had turned out fine without her and Harry's interference), but the 
comedy still works on its own very broad terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The characters are caricatures, with Harry (Rusty Perry) dressed in an aloha 
shirt, plaid shorts, brown calf-length socks and white sandals, while Maxine 
(Jan Glasband) looks just as garish in her floral-print pedal pushers, green 
top and turquoise shoes. The Southerners are dressed more conservatively, but 
play their parts just as broadly -- the animated cartoon rooster Foghorn 
Leghorn would fit perfectly in this company. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups tend to be smarter at some time than others; everybody, for 
instance, accepts the concept of time travel surprisingly well. It's Harry's 
inspiration that he can manipulate events to his own devious needs that really 
sets things going. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Voland plays Col. Benhorn, Toni Beery is Benhorn's daffy daughter 
Lucinda, Irene Silbert and John Henry Whitaker appear as a couple other limbs 
of the family tree, and Harrison Ray and Brett Parrott portray Lucinda's 
ill-fated suitors. All are fine, gleefully overplaying under the playwright's 
direction in a fashion that's suitable for the Moorpark Melodrama. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Time for Murder" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday evenings at 8 p.m., concludes Sunday at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center, 3190 Cochran St., Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Free; donations for local earthquake relief are encouraged 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; 'DARROW' STRONG CASE FOR COURTROOM DRAMA; THE ONE-MAN 
PRESENTATION BRINGS TO LIFE THE CAREER OF ONE OF AMERICA'S PREEMINENT 
ATTORNEYS.

 Ventura County playgoers have several choices before them during the next few 
weeks, none more strongly recommended than the opportunity to see Ernest 
Huntley's portrayal of "Clarence Darrow," now in production by Ventura's Plaza 
Players. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a one-man presentation, written by David Rintels from the point of view 
of the veteran attorney and civil libertarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrow, who died in 1938, participated in numerous fascinating and 
historically important cases -- including the Pullman Strike of 1894, the 
Scopes "Monkey Trial" of 1925, and the defense of thrill killers Nathan Leopold 
and Richard Loeb. He was a vital cog in the American labor movement and saved 
more than 50 accused murderers from capital punishment, a penalty he fought 
indefatigably. 
</P>
<P>
 Rintels' script includes all of those cases and more, some of them more 
thoroughly depicted than others. (It neglects to mention, for instance, that 
Darrow's defense of Tennessee schoolteacher John Scopes' teaching of Darwin's 
then-illegal theory of evolution lost to prosecutor William Jennings Bryan.) 
</P>
<P>
 The play largely ignores Darrow's personal life -- but evidently so did 
Darrow, so caught up in the law and his causes was he. 
</P>
<P>
 There's considerable drama -- waiting for the verdict in a seemingly 
unwinnable Iowa murder trial, discovering the medieval conditions under which 
Americans were forced to work well into this century, and learning why Darrow's 
defense of two brothers accused of bombing the Los Angeles Times in 1911 lost 
him the backing of the labor movement and virtually cost him his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntley's performance, directed by Michael Maynez, is strong and assured -- 
although Darrow may have grandstanded in front of juries, Huntley doesn't need 
to before his audience, and his performance is all the stronger for it. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Clarence Darrow. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., through April 9. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Plaza Players Theater, 34 N. Palm St. (in the Livery Arts Center), 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $7 Wednesdays, $9 Fridays and $10 Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For reservations or further information, call 643-9460.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; COLLECTION OF CAMERAS SHEDS LIGHT ON THE PAST; 
WES LAMBERT OF CAMARILLO HAS MORE THAN 80 OF THE CINEMATIC NOVELTIES, DATING 
FROM 1898. HE SAYS, 'EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS A STORY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside a dimly lit garage in Camarillo, Wes Lambert demonstrates a motion 
picture device that predates Thomas Edison. The device, a perforated cylinder 
with drawings inside, creates, when rotated, an optical illusion called 
persistence of vision, which makes it seem as if the images are moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movies weren't invented by Thomas Edison or anyone," Lambert explained. "They 
just evolved." 
</P>
<P>
 He has some authority on the topic. Lambert's own persistence and vision have 
led him to accumulate the largest private collection of antique, hand-crank 
movie cameras in the country -- more than 80 of them, the oldest from 1898. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of them has a story," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's more than willing to tell them too. Point to a wooden box on the wall 
or a curiously shaped black steel case with a lens on it and Lambert is ready 
with a discourse on camera arcana. Take the Bell and Howell 2709B, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first camera with a metal magazine (to hold the film) and 
multiple lenses. The registry between the frames is so good that it's still 
used to film animation." 
</P>
<P>
 And the weird looking device next to it? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a 1912 Akley, serial No. 2. It was the first action camera. Akley was 
a British taxidermist who filmed gorillas. He had so much trouble with the 
cameras then available, that he designed his own. It was the first camera you 
could pan with just one hand. It was so easy to use that it became the standard 
camera for newsreels and filming sports." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this couldn't be further removed from Lambert's own film experience. 
For 24 years he supervised and designed high-speed movie cameras and other 
optical instrumentation to gather data for missile tests in the California 
desert and later at the Point Mugu Pacific Missile Test Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert's own contribution to the world of photography from his test center 
days is a multimedia array of white enamel lenses, all the size of cannon 
barrels, mounted on a 1,000-pound platform that takes its inspiration from 
anti-aircraft guns. It is about as far removed from the wooden, hand-crank 
cameras as a rhinoceros is from a troglodyte. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his heart is with the old stuff. The list of cinematic novelties he 
possesses is exhaustive: a movie camera that photographs on glass plates, one 
of Edison's cameras, a Japanese movie camera shaped like a machine gun that was 
used for training Imperial Japanese aircraft gunners -- there is always one 
more thing Lambert has to show his guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this one. It's a French camera called the Sept. That means seven in 
French. They named it that because it has seven functions." 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert demonstrates how the palm-sized black box can take movies, still 
pictures and even function as a projector or enlarger. 
</P>
<P>
 As enthusiastic as he is, Lambert, 70, knows he has to make arrangements for 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see it in a museum in Hollywood, but I'll probably end up selling 
it and putting the money in a trust fund for my grandchildren's education." 
</P>
<P>
 So how will Lambert get used to the empty garage once he sells his precious 
collection? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, the garage won't be empty. My wife will finally be able to park her car 
in there."

JAUNTS; WELCOME ADDITION TO BICYCLE PATH; THE 2.3-MILE STRETCH OF THE 
10-FOOT-WIDE ARROYO SIMI BIKEWAY BRINGS LENGTH OF TRAIL TO 6.1 MILES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's some good news for bicyclists in Ventura County's east end: a new 
addition to the Arroyo Simi Bicycle Path now stretches the urban bikeway 6.1 
miles across Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you can pedal along the waterway from Madera Road on the west end of the 
city to Santa Susana Park and the new Metrolink station at Los Angeles Avenue 
on the east side. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District just opened the new 2.3-mile leg 
on the east end. With views to the south of rolling green hills, the new 
extension softens the urban feel of the rest of the route. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to ride the entire Arroyo Simi Bicycle Path, here's what you'll 
find. (Starting from the west end, park along Easy Street, just east of Madera 
Road.) 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-foot-wide trail takes off with a scenic jolt, rolling through an 
industrial area, past auto body shops and a lumber yard. It's noisy, not the 
serene ride you probably had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 But, ironically, it is through this stretch that you might spot herons or 
egrets gracing the shallow waters in the channel alongside the bike path. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the winter, we also get a wild duck population," said Don Hunt, assistant 
general manager of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll notice the water flowing west in the rock-lined channel, meaning that 
you are going uphill. It's a gradual climb all the way to the east end. The 
rise in elevation is 258 feet, according to Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The industrial area gives way to apartment complexes and homes. At Erringer 
Road, you can turn south and go into picturesque Rancho Simi Community Park, 
where water and restrooms are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after Sycamore Drive, watch for a trail spur that goes out to Los Angeles 
Avenue. To stay on the route, you'll need to avoid that and make a loop off to 
the right over a little bridge that keeps you on the Arroyo Simi trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, you'll see groves of newly planted trees -- oak, sycamore, 
citrus, walnut and apricot -- all in keeping with the city's heritage, 
according to Hunt. Eventually, the trees will add some shade. You can't miss an 
interesting tangle of massive cactus plants along the trail. A few horse 
properties border the path. An equestrian trail runs along the other side of 
the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of new trail begins at Royal Avenue. The old portion of the trail 
was built over the last seven or eight years with state grants at a cost of 
$510,000, Hunt said. Grants for the new link came to $460,000. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll notice the surroundings are more scenic with the backdrop of rolling 
hills. For a short distance, you'll have to detour around Darrah Park, but 
eventually the path will run along the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Angeles Avenue, the bike path continues on the sidewalk on the south 
side to the Metrolink station. To get to Santa Susana Park, Hunt recommends 
crossing Los Angeles Avenue at Stearns Street until a better crossing is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time you reach Los Angeles Avenue, you will have crossed five streets. 
These are not intersections where you can simply slow down, look both ways and 
pedal across. At each crossing, riders must get off their bikes and walk them 
through a narrow sort of turnstile before crossing the street. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Arroyo Simi Bicycle Path. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: With a new addition at the east end, the Simi Valley path now extends 
from Madera Road to Los Angeles Avenue, just west of Stearns Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * INFORMATION: Call the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, 584-4400. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: The next addition to the bike path will be a quarter-mile section west 
of Madera Road.

HISTORY; BLUE AND GRAY, MINUS BULLETS, BLOOD; TWO CIVIL WAR GROUPS WILL 
EXCHANGE MUSKET VOLLEYS AT LAKE CASITAS THIS WEEKEND. EXPECT AUTHENTICITY AS 
WELL AS REFRESHMENTS.

<P>
 Volunteers in blue and gray, 130 years later are still fighting the Civil War, 
but nobody's dying anymore. Several hundred Civil War re-enactors from the Fort 
Tejon Historical Assn. and the Santa Barbara Civil War Council are expected on 
Saturday and Sunday at the campgrounds of Lake Casitas near Ojai to scare some 
fish as well as entertain the curious. 
</P>
<P>
 There'll be Yankee units marching elbow-to-elbow exchanging musketry volleys 
50 yards from their Confederate counterparts; there'll be cavalry charges and 
artillery duels. Everything will be real except for the bullets and the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no truth to the rumor that every fifth paying customer will qualify 
for a free amputation with a dull saw after two sips of brandy. Dysentery and 
disease, which killed more Civil War soldiers than bullets, will also be 
mercifully absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there will be parades, battalion camps and opportunities to talk to 
the participants. Food and beverages will be available continuously during the 
two-day 10 a.m.-to-dusk living history experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Mann, the Confederate major (and lawyer) from Thousand Oaks, explained 
during a recent interview that war is no longer hell, but apparently, a heckuva 
lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 No one wants to re-enact Vietnam or World War I. What is the attraction of the 
Civil War? 
</P>
<P>
 Because it was Americans fighting Americans, so there's no bad guys. In the 
Civil War, there's a certain romance and pageantry among the combatants of that 
period, and it's extremely colorful. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there more Confederates or more Yankees? 
</P>
<P>
 There's more Confederates because I think there's more to admire in the 
Southern armies. They were men who were led by men who were seen as godlike. 
They fought so long and so hard with so little. You just can't help but marvel 
at those guys. But there has to be two sides, otherwise, it's not a 
re-enactment, but an encampment. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you think is the attraction of the Southern side? 
</P>
<P>
 I think Robert E. Lee was the finest soldier ever to wear a uniform on 
American soil. The war would never have happened if not for slavery, but only 
one out of nine Southern soldiers owned slaves. Nowhere in the Constitution 
does it say a state can't secede. The Union never would have formed in the 
first place if it was to be an indissoluble bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Who wins and who dies? 
</P>
<P>
 It's all choreographed. It's usually, "OK, you win this one, we'll win the 
next one." 
</P>
<P>
 How often does the war resume? 
</P>
<P>
 The Fort Tejon Historical Assn. is the largest re-enactment group in Southern 
California, and we meet about once a month. Fort Tejon itself is inconvenient 
for everyone, but it's been a good place for us. For this particular event, the 
FTHA will run the re-enactment on the field. Gold Coast Productions, which is 
promoting the event, will be contributing to the FTHA. It's a good way for all 
the units to find new recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 How much does it cost to enlist? 
</P>
<P>
 It depends on what side and what unit. Usually, it's around $175 to $200 for a 
uniform. It's hard to play softball for less than that. A jacket is around $80 
to $90; a pair of pants is about $60, a hat about $20 to $25, a shirt about 
$25, and a pair of suspenders about $10. The shoes, called Brogans, have square 
toes and are sort of like modern work shoes, and cost around $75 to $90. For 
infantrymen, a Civil War musket, an exact reproduction of an Enfield, which are 
all made in Italy, costs a few hundred bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it true that re-enactments began shortly after the war itself ended? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably so, but it really sprang up during the Civil War Centennial. Back 
then, a gray shirt from Sears was OK. The stuff that got by then wouldn't even 
be allowed on the field now. The authenticity standards are quite high. For 
myself, I was in the Army Reserve and Michael Shaara's book about Gettysburg, 
"The Killer Angels," was required reading. Three weeks later, "Glory" came out, 
and I went to check it out. If I had known about all this sooner, I would've 
joined 10 years ago. Details

FASHION; DRESS WARM BUT LOOK COOL ON THE SLOPES; FORGET NEON -- EARTH COLORS 
ARE IN. AND SPANDEX PANTS WON'T PROTECT YOU FROM THE COLD LIKE ONE-PIECE SUITS. 
</P>

<P>
 So you want to get in some spring skiing, and you need to know what to wear. 
Yes, clothing is a vital part of your outdoor experience. As a novice, you will 
want to learn not only to use the right ski terms, like schuss, and possibly 
Mayday -- which will impress your friends only moderately -- but to look right 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if you're going to be conspicuous by falling down instead of 
traversing or Christy-ing, or whatever else it is you originally set out to do 
-- you will want to be correct in the way you dress. At least you will look 
cool on the lift. Which is half the battle, as every fashion-conscious outdoors 
person knows. 
</P>
<P>
 So, this week's column will put you in the right outfit. Of course, you can go 
to the thrift stores and get 1989 Day-Glo ski wear, but it will make you look 
like a geek; and if you wanted to look like a geek, why are you reading a 
fashion column to begin with? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the drift: 
</P>
<P>
 First, we recommend getting one of those new cow hats, which will give you a 
laid-back image. And those horns and ears are certain to slow you down in the 
wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if cows are too pastoral, there are buffalo and raccoon hats, which offer 
more of a wilderness experience. These are distinctive too, especially if 
you're buried by an avalanche with only your headgear showing. Rescue workers 
would almost surely dig you out first, just to check the rest of your outfit. 
Not that avalanches are common on bunny slopes; but, why not be prepared? 
</P>
<P>
 Next, it's important to decide which look you want. The main choices available 
to the female skier are the technical and the foofoo looks, according to Jay 
Straky who works at Circle Ski & Sports in Westlake. Most people like one or 
the other, not both, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foofoo skier will favor things like fake fur trim on parkas, burnished 
silver buttons, iridescent aqua or pink jackets. She will also wear spandex 
pants rather than the warmer one-piece suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think the one-piece makes them look fat," Straky said. 
</P>
<P>
 On warmer days, stretch pants and jacket are comfortable on the slopes; but if 
it's windy or snowing, they can ruin a skier's day. Some foofoo people will 
stay in the lodge rather than go bulky, Straky said. Others break down and 
switch to technical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see more people going to the one-piece now; husbands and boyfriends don't 
have much patience if you are always whining that you're cold," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides these looks, there is the Michelin Man look, which is technical taken 
one step further. This look was identified by Pam Creasy of Sport Chalet in 
Oxnard, who said a heavily padded outfit is popular with some skiers, but 
basically on its way out. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't as much fluff in insulation the last couple of years," she said. 
"The technology is getting better and better." 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular feature with some ski wear customers is Gore-Tex lamination 
and sealed seams, several retailers said. This refinement was invented for 
hard-core mountaineering and makes fabric completely waterproof. Those who buy 
it for skiing are probably the same people who have home generators and cyclone 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The same crowd may be the main consumers of battery-operated warming gloves, 
which we saw on display in the three-figure price range. 
</P>
<P>
 Other ways to spend extra money on ski wear include designer outfits, with 
prices that peak in the low four figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Straky compared these labels to vehicles. "Kaelin would be the Jag; Bognar, 
that's the Rolls Royce. Obermeyer would be the Cadillac," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of Ford outfits as well, selling in the range of $400 to 
$500. But bargains can be found for less, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothes can last decades. But you run the risk of being out of color sync. 
For instance, until a couple of years ago, neon dominated the scene; now it's 
considered, well, geeky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all becoming more earth tones," said Chris Tolley, former owner of Ski 
Hut in Camarillo, which closed last week. "Probably in another three years, who 
knows -- heaven forbid that we'd go back to Day-Glo. It kind of reflects the 
mood the country's in; right now they are back to basics." 
</P>
<P>
 So, that's what's in. And if you want something that won't go out, it'll be 
hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Our best advice for those who want permanence in ensembles is to stay off the 
slopes and take up cross-country instead. Those skiers appear to have more 
style tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen on the Nordic trail this year by our informants were skiers in jeans, 
wool knickers, U.S. Navy-vintage bell bottoms and sweats over thermals. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about half are in trendy spandex, said John Rupp of Great Pacific Iron 
Works in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to be a more woodsy type of people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolley, an alpine man, describes the group as "nature Nazis." From a 
retailer's standpoint, they are not a good bet. Even those who want high-tech 
clothes are "ones," he said, while most downhill people "would own three or 
four jackets and two pairs of pants." 
</P>
<P>
 There you have it. But, like we said -- our readers are the fashion elite of 
the county. So, go ahead with your color-coordinated shopping, and check this 
space next fall to find out what items to replace for '95. SCHUSS!

FOR THE KIDS; SCHOOL PRINCIPAL HAS HIGH-FLYING HOBBY; HER PASSION IS BUILDING 
KITES, AND SHE PASSES ON HER KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL IN WORKSHOPS FOR YOUNGSTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 On weekdays, Principal Beverley Radloff is in charge of Simi Valley's 
Atherwood School. But on weekends, she's likely to be at the controls of a 
stunt kite zooming the skies with graceful power. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that the kids at Atherwood don't know about Radloff's kite passion. 
Every spring, she holds a special kite day at the school when she teaches them 
how to build their own kites. 
</P>
<P>
 Radloff knows as much about building as flying them. She has been teaching 
kite-building workshops through the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District 
the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 She is doing two workshops March 19. The first, from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m., is 
for families. The second, from 1 to 3 p.m., is for teachers, Scout leaders and 
other adults who work with children. 
</P>
<P>
 So how is it that Radloff, who has a 24-year-old son, became a "kiter?" When 
her son was 8 years old, the family visited the Smithsonian Institution in 
Washington, where she picked up a book on kites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got blown away," said Radloff, whose big, jovial laugh often punctuates her 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trip, she bought her first kite, a small cotton job she still has. 
Soon after that, she started teaching her son's Scout troop as well as other 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 She has lost count, she said, of the number of kites she has collected over 
the years. She has bought and flown them in Japan, Korea, Hawaii and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 She has made quite a few too -- a project that takes up the entire living 
room. One of her creations is a 9-by-10-foot jumbo kite, a design known as a 
"sled." Using a pattern, she sewed rainbow-colored nylon strips together, 
leaving a triangular-shaped opening in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 During the workshop, the kids will make a similar, simplified version that is 
about one-third that size, she said. Using a pattern, they'll make the kites 
from plastic trash bags or paper bags -- not nylon. And, instead of sewing 
them, they'll use tape. By the end of the class, they'll have a ready-to-fly 
kite. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Radloff, flying a kite is simply a matter of using common sense. 
Nonetheless, she passed on some advice: "Everyone thinks you must run with a 
kite. You don't have to. In the right wind, you can launch it out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 For parents interested in buying their child a kite, she offered this: "Don't 
buy a stunt kite." Buy something far less expensive that is less complicated 
and will fly reliably. 
</P>
<P>
 And lastly: If kite lines get tangled, don't bring the kites down and try to 
untangle them on the ground. Do it while they are aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, all this sounds simple, coming from a woman who knows kite parts as 
well as a mechanic knows cars. When she takes to the air, she likes to fly a 
double -- two kites attached to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 She has never competed. "I fly for the joy of it," she said. She flies 
whenever she can, especially during the summer. Even when she takes a trip, she 
loads four or five kites into her special kite bag. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still a family sport, sort of. Her son flies with her, sometimes at the 
beach in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 As for her husband: "He has a bad habit of dumping them in the ocean." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Storyteller Jim Woodard will be at Oxnard's Heritage Square on Sunday with a 
tale about a seal that becomes human and then reverts back to being a seal. 
He'll also be telling a story about a corn farmer who couldn't die. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, mainly for kids 6 to 12, starts at 2 p.m. in Heritage Square 
Hall, 7th and A streets downtown. Craig Newton of Simi Valley will provide the 
music. Admission is $2. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Kite-building workshops offered by the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: March 19. First session for families, from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. Second 
session for adults, 1 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 1692 Sycamore Drive, in the multipurpose room. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $10 for the family session (children under 8 must be assisted by an 
adult during the workshop); $5 for the adult session. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: To register for the workshop, call the district at 584-4400. All 
materials will be supplied.

COMEDY; HE'S PROUD TO BE GAY AND THAT'S NO JOKE; JASON STUART CAME OUT ON 
'GERALDO.' HIS STAND-UP ROUTINE, HE SAYS, IS OUTRAGEOUS, FUNNY AND THE TRUTH.

 Is honesty the best policy? It depends. George Washington, apparently, 
suffered no ill effects from his cherry tree episode. Bruce Wayne and Peter 
Parker get along OK, even though they adamantly refuse to reveal their secret 
identities of Batman and Spiderman to everyone except 40 billion comic book 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Jason Stuart came out about being gay last year, and so far his 
career has suffered no ill effects. Well, that's if you don't count those 
pickets in Kansas City, but more on them later. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart, who will bring his routine to Revival in Santa Barbara, had been on 
the stand-up circuit for a decade when he decided to make his private life 
public on the syndicated show "Geraldo" last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Also an actor, Stuart has appeared on all 10,000 of those cable stand-up 
comedy shows and has numerous TV credits, which include "Murder, She Wrote" and 
the "John Larroquette Show." He also has worked on a number of feature films, 
including "Kindergarten Cop" with Ahhh-nold. 
</P>
<P>
 His stand-up routine, which has been compared to that of the late Paul Lynde, 
has led to his often being cast in stereotypical gay roles. The comedian wants 
the opportunity to compete for straight roles as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In a phoner from his Los Angeles home, Stuart discussed the recent changes in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You're on the "Coming Out" tour. Why did you come out? 
</P>
<P>
 I just didn't want to live a lie anymore. There's a lot of gay and lesbian 
kids out there with no one to turn to. When I was young, I always felt so 
alone. It's been a very positive experience, and now everything is so much more 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me a Geraldo story. 
</P>
<P>
 He was just so gracious, incredibly sexy and such a dear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You speak of narrow-mindedness in the film industry. There are a lot of gay 
people in Hollywood, so who are you talking about, the sponsors? 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's a lot of people, but mostly the people in power. Are you gay? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 
</P>
<P>
 Who do you think is sexy? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, my girlfriend because she'll kill me, but on TV, probably Christina 
Applegate. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, but if you found out she was gay, wouldn't you still love her? Wouldn't 
you still think she's sexy? I've fantasized about heterosexual people all my 
life, but I'm not mad at all you guys. Most who know don't care. Those who 
don't know any gay people, care. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Do you foresee a time when a person's sexual orientation is irrelevant? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I don't see it that close. But right now, I see it as a means to call 
attention to yourself. It was a positive step for me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Geffen came out, but he's a zillionaire, so he's basically immune to any 
negative feedback. What was the worst-case scenario? 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't get any work and I wouldn't have a career. Actually, I've gotten 
more work, stand-up wise, but for acting, it's the same. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is the importance of positive role models for other gays? 
</P>
<P>
 It gives you a sense of who you are. As a kid, all I knew was that I was a bad 
person, and I didn't even know why. I was just supposed to shut up about it. I 
still wrestle with it in my head and try to kick out the demons. The demons are 
very tiny now, but when you encounter rejection every day, it's difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You were picketed in Kansas City? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, my God. There was this guy -- I won't even say his name -- but he had this 
very small group of right-wing fundamentalist Christians. I don't want to diss 
Christians at all, but this group decided they didn't want me to have my job. 
If you don't want to see me, you don't have to go to the show. Anyway, some 
pickets who supported me came to picket the pickets, and naturally the show 
sold out. They clapped for five minutes before I even said a word and gave me a 
standing ovation at the end of the show. I think the overall feeling in Kansas 
City was one of embarrassment. No one wants to be prejudicial anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's the basic difference between stand-up comedy and acting? 
</P>
<P>
 Limitations. In acting, they want to limit me. There's very few parts they'll 
let me play. I'm always wrong for everything. As an actor, I want to be able to 
play any part, straight or gay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's the secret to survival on the road as a stand-up comedian? 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of books. Exercise program. Good friends you can call on. Do as much PR 
as possible, and be as nice as you can be to everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Describe your stand-up act. 
</P>
<P>
 Outrageous, funny and the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who goes? 
</P>
<P>
 I have a very eclectic group from gays to old Jews to black women and little 
Barbies. I'm very hetero-friendly. And I'm single. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who do you think is funny? 
</P>
<P>

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE BARBECUED; OXNARD EATERY CAN TURN

 The Gorilla Grill is a fairly new establishment facing Oxnard Boulevard, just 
across from The Esplanade mall and south of the 101. Its name, and the mural of 
a gorilla across one interior wall, tell nothing of its cuisine and certainly 
betray the warmth of its staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The space is high-ceilinged and cavernous, with lonely overhead lighting, and 
divided quite plainly in two: a dining area, with booths and open tables, and a 
bar that features TVs and a few open tables. For all the attempts at 
light-hearted zoo theme, it's impossible, on first visit, to get a line on what 
type of establishment this is. L.A.'s Monkey Bar trades on exotic themes, 
audaciously exotic cuisine, and the kitschy risk of its name. But Oxnard's 
Gorilla Grill seems to be designed for an inevitable response by first timers: 
Gorilla Grill? What's that? 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the proverbial hook. Scan the menu and you'll find that the 
Gorilla Grill is another barbecue house bolstered by an extensive listing of 
pasta and alternate-choice dishes. So much for identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Eating here can be satisfying. Or frustrating. Or bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 In one moment the kitchen turns out a perfect rosy New York steak, deep in 
flavor and trim in cut; but in the next will deliver a plate of squid so 
over-breaded and insufficiently fried as to be inedible, with zero redemption 
offered by the plain ketchup accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 For every tender, soulful helping of barbecued tri-tip lurks a pale, wan 
(parboiled?) set of barbecued baby back ribs whose trace coating of sweet, 
bland barbecue sauce barely commands notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, you can do well here. The house is, if anything, excessively concerned 
with your well-being -- offering a rare guarantee of pleasure in this day of 
uninformed, mannerless servers. But choose from the menu carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid the squid. But among appetizers do try the armadillo eggs ($5.95), in 
which Cheddar cheese is wrapped in hot green chile, breaded, quick-fried, and 
served with a Ranch dipping sauce. They're original, richly flavorful and 
perfectly executed. Fried mozzarella sticks ($4.75) are handled as well but 
left in the lurch, somewhat, by a bland tomato dip. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar salad ($6.50) is decent and fresh, but not so good when ordered with 
chicken breast ($8.25) that turns out wanting for flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoked chicken pasta ($8.95) has delicious touches with deep smoky chicken 
pieces and flavorful pesto-cream sauce. Alas, the dish is marred by mushy, 
overcooked tube noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 At heart, The Gorilla Grill is a meat house. So the New York steak ($13.25) is 
a winner, even if it did arrive without the whole roasted garlic advertised on 
the menu. Beef ribs are generously proportioned and flavorful, grilled as they 
are over a mesquite fire, though they wear the too-sweet house sauce; they're 
the clear choice over the boring baby back ribs ($10.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Half chicken ($10.25), which is marinated in teriyaki sauce before expert 
treatment on the barbecue, is truly first-rate: charred outside, succulent and 
sweet within. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dishes here arrive with chili beans, suitably smoky and cooked, happily, 
to retain firmness, or a perfect baked potato; and soup or salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Go for that casual midweek meal, enjoy the friendly service and dark beer on 
tap, and pick from among the steak or chicken dishes for the most promising 
meal. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Gorilla Grill 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 2639 Wagon Wheel Road, Oxnard

SHOP TALK; STEPPING OUT TO TRACK DOWN THE BEST BUYS IN COWBOY BOOTS; THE 
GROWING POPULARITY OF COUNTRY DANCING HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR 
WESTERN-STYLE FOOTWEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Cowboy boots go in and out of fashion in the big city. But here in Ventura 
County, the appeal of the cowboy boot never fades. With the popularity of 
country music and dance comes a demand for boots that will put us in a Western 
frame of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Boots are also essential to horseback riders. As protective footgear, the 
large heel keeps the foot from slipping through the stirrup and keeps the rider 
free from peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, we all stand a bit taller in our cowboy boots. They give us an 
edge, an attitude that Adidas just can't provide. 
</P>
<P>
 We searched high and low in Ventura for the best source of boots. We found 
many styles in a wide range of prices. If you are looking for boots for 
dancing, riding or cleaning out the stable, we can help you find them. 
</P>
<P>
 Just getting interested in line dancing? You'll want to keep your investment 
small, at least until you know you are hooked. Good boots for dancers to begin 
with are Dingos, Code West or even the fashion boot from Payless. For $40 or 
less you'll have a good time. Of course, if you want to do some fancy footwork, 
like a pivot or a slide, you'll have to two-step up to a leather-soled boot. 
</P>
<P>
 The three main suppliers of boots in the county are The Wharf, in Ventura; 
Howard and Phil's in The Oaks mall and the Buenaventura Mall; and Hilltop Feed 
and Ranch in Thousand Oaks. The Wharf and Hilltop carry work boots, English 
riding boots, and muckers along with cowboy boots. Howard and Phil's is 
strictly Western style. Prices were pretty similar. Howard and Phil's and The 
Wharf had just ended big sales. Shucks. However, that does mean there is a 
fresh supply of new styles. 
</P>
<P>
 We were surprised to learn that the colorful history of cowboy boots includes 
boot makers who have been in business for nearly 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Joe Justin Boot Co. began in the late 19th Century in Texas. The Lucchese 
Boot Co. was founded by the five Lucchese brothers in 1883 in San Antonio. The 
Lucchese is reputed to be the Rolls Royce of Western boots. Known for elegance 
and subtle styling, the Lucchese boots' leathers and skins are tanned and 
treated in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lama began his boot company in El Paso in 1912, with a great deal of his 
inventory initially going to the U.S. Calvary. In those days, an average pair 
of boots cost $11. Now they sell for between $111 (for a standard "Roper") to a 
few hundred dollars for the finer boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Enid Justin (Joe's daughter) founded Nocona Boot Co. in 1925. As a woman owner 
of a company she was a pioneer of her time. Nocona was first to manufacture 
shoe boots for square dancers in the 1930s. When Guess Jeans used two pairs of 
vintage shoe boots in an ad in 1987, they sparked a huge revival of the shoe 
boot. 
</P>
<P>
 The fit of a cowboy boot is very different from the fit of an average shoe. To 
begin with, expect your heel to slide in a new boot; don't let the slippage put 
you into a smaller boot. After the leather conforms to your foot, by shrinking 
in some areas and stretching in others, the slip will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 But those pointy toes are kind of scary, aren't they? Especially when you hear 
they're called "Roach Killers"! Don't worry, nobody expects your toes to get 
squeezed into there. These boots can be incredibly comfortable. Check out the 
Tony Lamas or the Lucchese if your feet are narrow. Those with wide feet might 
find that boots by Dan Post or Rios of Mercedes fit better. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowboy boots are made to last. Gary, sales manager of boots at The Wharf, says 
he hasn't thrown out a pair of boots in the 17 years he's been wearing 
Lucchese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wharf has by far the best selection of exotic skins. Ostrich, anteater, 
stingray and elk are all sold here. Our personal favorite are those gator boots 
for only $4,500! 
</P>
<P>
 The cowboy boot has become a popular collector's item. If you find a great 
pair at a garage sale or a church bazaar you might want to make an investment. 
As folk art goes, cowboy boots are appealing for their colorful reminder of our 
recent past.

ERRORS FOUND IN TEST SCORING OF 2 O.C. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State testing officials acknowledged Wednesday that they botched the results 
for two Orange County schools where poor scores on new statewide tests were 
reported this week, further frustrating local education officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools are Corona del Mar High (7-12) in Newport Beach and Fred Newhart 
Elementary (K-8) in Mission Viejo. These are the first errors confirmed, but 
about 15 other schools -- none in Orange County -- have contacted the 
California Department of Education to challenge their results. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that processed the California Learning Assessment System tests 
said in a memo to local school officials Wednesday it had "discovered a 
problem" with the eighth-grade math scores at Corona del Mar and Newhart 
Elementary, both of which had ranked lowest in Orange County on that segment of 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel violated," said Mac Bernd, superintendent of the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District, which includes Corona del Mar High. Bernd, who called the 
testing system "a fiasco," said a portion of tests at both schools were lost 
and students were given zeros for that section. 
</P>
<P>
 The company promised to produce corrected results within a month, and state 
officials said they will continue to look for similar problems at other 
schools. The glitch in the reporting increased skepticism about the testing 
system, in which only a sampling of the tests were scored in each district. 
Some educators worry that as a result the scores do not reflect the entire 
student population, while others are concerned that less obvious errors will go 
undetected. 
</P>
<P>
 When the lowest math scores in the county were scored by Corona del Mar and 
Newhart, which both traditionally score high on standardized tests, it raised a 
red flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about the schools that weren't as dramatic?" asked Barbara Smith, 
assistant superintendent of the Capistrano Unified School District, which 
includes Newhart. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd noted that the errors have also thrown off district and county averages. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot bigger than our little situation," he said. "People take this 
stuff seriously. We make important decisions based on how kids do on tests. We 
don't take these as a joke. It's absolutely important that the testing be 
well-executed. That information has to be impeccable. It'd be the same as if a 
corporation were cooking the books." 
</P>
<P>
 Taken last spring by more than 1 million students statewide and about 69,000 
in Orange County, the CLAS tests in reading, writing and math are intended to 
evaluate how students think as well as whether they can get the correct answer. 
The math portion of the test included multiple-choice questions involving 
several computations and a word problem in which students had to show their 
work with charts, pictures and essays. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were scored on a six-level scale, with results reported as the 
percentage of students in an individual school or district that scored at each 
level. Only about half of the tests overall were actually scored. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the results released Wednesday, 97% of the eighth graders at both 
Corona del Mar and Newhart scored at the two lowest levels, showing "little or 
no mathematical thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 But now state officials admit those results are flawed because those schools' 
multiple-choice answer sheets were missing and were all given scores of zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd said that a representative from CTB MacMillan/McGraw Hill, the company 
that processed the testing data for the state, told him Wednesday that state 
education officials decided to substitute either zeros or the local school 
district's average where scores were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS consultant Gerry Shelton, who works for the Department of Education, 
denied that his office suggested using zeros but said it did decide to 
substitute the district average when school scores were missing because it was 
"the best data we had." 
</P>
<P>
 But a computer glitch left those schools with zeros anyway, Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly there were (problems) -- this was the first year of a program," 
Shelton said. "We tested over a million students, we processed something 
between eight and 10 million documents, there was a problem in just dealing 
with the volume. . . . It's unfortunate that (this) happened." 
</P>
<P>
 An angry Bernd said CTB also told him Wednesday that Corona del Mar's answer 
sheets were eventually found but that the scores were never input to replace 
the zeros. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a crime," he said. "You've got everybody in the county looking over the 
scores with a magnifying glass. . . . If you give them information that is 
incorrect, they can become cynical about the importance of testing. That can be 
a real hindrance to school improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the news brought a sort of relief to administrators at Corona del Mar 
and Newhart, it only increased others' frustration with the new tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am concerned that the design of the test is so flawed that it will not give 
us reliable or valid information, ever," said Capistrano Unified's Smith. "The 
state needs to slow this process down, slow the train down, make sure that what 
you do you do well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unfortunate part of all this is I don't think parents are going to be 
able to stand back and say, 'This is just a benchmark.' They're going to 
compare school to school, and I think it's very unfair to the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, though, administrators at Corona del Mar and Newhart were just 
glad that the original scores are incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got about a dozen phone messages on my desk that aren't very 
friendly-sounding. I'm delighted to hear that there may be a problem," said 
Corona del Mar Principal Tom Jacobson. "If there is a mistake, I can understand 
it. . . . There are bound to be a few glitches the first time out of the chute. 
Unfortunately, we may have been one of the first victims."

12 DIE, 8 HURT IN PICKUP CRASH NEAR BARSTOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A compact pickup truck crammed with 20 people apparently heading from Mexico 
to Los Angeles drifted off a freeway and crashed into a drainage culvert near 
here early Wednesday, killing 12 passengers and sending eight others to 
hospitals with serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol said the driver apparently fell asleep at the 
wheel after driving all night from the Mexican border town of Nogales, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims were flung from the wreckage and scattered across the 
rock-strewn desert in what the CHP described as one of the most deadly 
single-vehicle accidents in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were bodies on top of bodies, people in pain lying on top of people 
lying in pain," said motorist Robert Silver, who stopped at the scene moments 
after the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four people who had been wedged into the cab of the 1981 Toyota pickup, 
only the driver survived. Nine of the 16 passengers in the bed of the pickup, 
which was covered by a camper shell, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 A CHP investigator said there were so many people in the vehicle that the 
weight of the human cargo may have been greater than the weight of the vehicle 
itself. He said that although the truck was approximately 1,700 pounds above 
the manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating, that in itself was not a 
violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because a driver is responsible for the safety of his passengers, the 
CHP said it would seek at least 12 counts of vehicular manslaughter against the 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the seven men and five women who died was a pregnant woman. Of the 
survivors, at least one was from El Salvador. That passenger, Alejandro 
Enriquez, 24, told Associated Press after he was released from Barstow 
Community Hospital that the group of immigrants met after entering the United 
States. He said that as the group grew to 20, each contributed $50 toward a 
trip to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP said the truck was registered to a Los Angeles man, Elder Ruado Mejia 
Ordonez. Officers said the driver of the vehicle, who did not have a driver's 
license, identified himself as Aidan B. Ordonez. Whether they are related, or 
perhaps even the same man, was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Elder Ordonez was cited after a traffic accident last year for driving without 
a license. CHP investigators said they had no idea whether the group of 
immigrants had entered the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not our area of expertise," Pitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the group apparently left Nogales about 7 p.m. Tuesday. CHP 
Lt. Don Pitt said some of the immigrants were headed for Los Angeles 
International Airport for flights elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before 6 a.m. Wednesday, the truck drifted off the freeway, veered nearly 
200 feet across a stretch of rocks, sand and dirt and and crashed into an 
earthen culvert that crosses beneath the freeway about 10 feet below pavement 
level. On impact, the vehicle buckled at a 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were bodies everywhere," said Silver, who used a roadside call box to 
summon help. "Most of them were making some kind of sounds. I was holding 
hands, trying to keep them still. They were very calm." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 16 passengers in the back of the pickup -- who under California law 
were not required to wear seat belts because of the camper shell -- six were 
ejected and killed. Three others who died in the back of the truck and three 
killed in the cab had to be removed from the wreckage with hydraulically 
powered rescue equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 It took the first emergency crews about 10 minutes to reach the scene. They 
were from a San Bernardino County Fire Department station in Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a good place for a crash," department spokesman Bill Peters 
said. "There's no three-minute response time out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Silver said he got the impression that none of the passengers knew each other 
because none were asking about the condition of the others. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, he said, was conscious after the accident and asked Silver to help 
him open the door. It was jammed, and the man stayed inside, alongside his dead 
passengers, until firefighters arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt said the lack of skid marks indicated the strong possibility that the 
driver fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had it not been for the number of fatalities, this would have been the basic 
accident we have out here, day after day -- people falling asleep on the road, 
" Pitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no immediate indications of mechanical failure, according to CHP 
Officer Steve Hobart. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the injured were brought by helicopter to the San Bernardino County 
Medical Center in San Bernardino. They are Jose Rosales, 20, listed in stable 
condition with a broken collarbone; Sonia Lopez, about 18, in stable condition 
with pelvic and leg fractures, and an unidentified woman, about 20, in critical 
condition with severe head and abdominal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitalized at the Loma Linda University Medical Center in Loma Linda were 
Odir Garcia 11, with possible head injuries; an unidentified woman in critical 
condition with multiple fractures and an unidentified man who was undergoing 
surgery for unspecified injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Flanders, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said 
the agency would question the survivors about their immigration status after 
their immediate medical needs were addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first order of business was to get them treated at hospitals," he said. 
"We want them in hospitals so they can get fixed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanders said those who smuggle immigrants into this country often cram that 
many people into a small vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have any qualms about the comfort or convenience of the people 
they carry," he said. "They'll get as many people into a space as they can, 
with no regard for comfort or human life." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst single-vehicle crash in California history occurred in 1976, when 29 
passengers in a bus were killed near Martinez, the CHP reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to this story were Times staff writers Edward J. Boyer, Carla 
Hall and Eric Malnic.

miles south of Barstow.

MIFFED YELTSIN SCRAPS TALKS WITH NIXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A furious President Boris N. Yeltsin snubbed Richard Nixon on Wednesday, 
declaring he will not receive the former U.S. President now that Nixon has met 
with Yeltsin's archenemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's sudden outburst, the latest jolt to U.S.-Russian relations, 
apparently took not only 81-year-old Nixon but also Yeltsin's own government by 
surprise. Yeltsin sent no private messages of warning or disapproval after 
Nixon met with former Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi on Monday and then 
with Communist Party leader Gennady A. Zyuganov on Tuesday, Nixon adviser 
Dmitri K. Simes said. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Wednesday morning, Yeltsin's chief of staff twice confirmed that a 
Yeltsin-Nixon meeting would take place, Simes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin was apparently especially infuriated by Nixon's meeting with Rutskoi, 
who was released from jail against Yeltsin's will only 12 days ago. He had been 
charged with treason for leading last October's violent parliamentary revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Former American President Nixon met Rutskoi and Zyuganov here, while the most 
interesting thing is that he had been coming here to meet me," an angry Yeltsin 
said Wednesday afternoon. "Russia is still a great country, and you cannot just 
play with it like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian president also canceled meetings that had been scheduled for Nixon 
with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and Chief of Staff Sergei A. Filatov 
and announced that no other government officials will see him. " Nyet ! After 
this, no!" Yeltsin told reporters after laying a wreath on the Kremlin grave of 
Soviet cosmonaut Yuri A. Gagarin. 
</P>
<P>
 In case Nixon failed to appreciate the insult, a security detail consisting of 
a car with three bodyguards that the Russian government had provided him was 
abruptly taken back, said Simes, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace in Washington who has arranged Nixon's recent trips to 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the former President, who voluntarily gave up his U.S. Secret 
Service protection several years ago because he felt he did not need it, 
already had his own private guard service, arranged with a Russian company. 
</P>
<P>
 And late Wednesday, Yeltsin's press service denied that the security detail 
had been removed, saying Nixon himself had said he did not require their 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hastily called news conference, Simes said that both the U.S. and Russian 
governments had been told in advance that Nixon was on a private fact-finding 
mission, not an official state visit. Both sides knew that Nixon would meet 
with opposition figures, including ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky, who was shunned by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore 
during their official visits to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Clinton said he had telephoned Nixon before the former 
President left on his 10-day visit to Russia. "And I said he should meet with 
whomever he wanted and I'd be interested to hear his reports when he got back," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Yeltsin should not assume that Mr. Nixon is not friendly toward his 
administration and toward democracy and toward reform because, quite the 
contrary, he's been a very strong supporter of our policy for the last year," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton suggested that Yeltsin should not "overreact" to Nixon's meetings with 
opposition leaders and urged him to reconsider meeting with Nixon "because I 
think they'd enjoy talking to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the incident is probably not as serious as the recent tensions 
between the United States and Russia over policy toward the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or over the Aldrich H. Ames espionage case, it once again 
demonstrates a new Russian determination not to tolerate what it considers 
demeaning treatment by the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether it was a mistake or a deliberate attempt to insult 
Russia," said Yeltsin spokesman Alexander B. Arfyonov. "If one comes on a 
visit, not to a banana republic but to Russia, one should thoroughly balance 
his actions and intentions." 
</P>
<P>
 But as one of Yeltsin's earliest, most ardent supporters, Nixon is an odd 
target for the 63-year-old Siberian's ire. On a visit to Russia in April, 1991, 
Nixon met Yeltsin against Gorbachev's wishes; Nixon later urged Washington to 
forge better ties with Gorbachev's rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was Nixon who persuaded the George Bush Administration to invite 
Yeltsin to the White House when the State Department had a dim view of the 
future Russian President, Simes said.

50-CENT CAPER COULD BE EX-CONVICT'S LAST STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY and DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Charles Ernest Bentley, convicted of manslaughter and kidnaping and 
possessor of a 52-page rap sheet, the future may come down to 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged Wednesday that Bentley wrested loose change from a 
homeless man on Los Angeles' Skid Row late Monday night, making him one of the 
first convicted felons to be charged under California's new "three strikes and 
you're out" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, which took effect less than nine hours before Bentley allegedly 
mugged the 60-year-old transient, Bentley faces a minimum sentence of 25 years 
to life if convicted of assault. The statute prescribes the sentence for anyone 
who has two prior serious or violent felonies and commits any felony on a third 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very, very upset," said Deputy Public Defender Nancy Gast, who entered 
a not guilty plea on Bentley's behalf at his arraignment Wednesday in Downtown 
Los Angeles. "He didn't even know what he had been arrested for." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley, 37, who would have faced a minimum sentence of 20 years under the old 
law, appeared briefly in the courtroom of Commissioner Kristi Lousteau. He 
followed moments after Donnell Albert Dorsey, 37, of Los Angeles, who also was 
charged under the "three strikes" law. Dorsey, arrested at 9:20 p.m. Monday, is 
believed to be the first felon in Los Angeles County to fall within the new 
law's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Dorsey in a stolen pickup truck in Southwest Los Angeles, and 
prosecutors have charged him with receiving stolen property. Dressed in a green 
hooded sweat shirt, Dorsey hung his head and hid from television cameras behind 
a courtroom pillar as Gast entered a not guilty plea and the commissioner 
ordered him and Bentley held in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 With seven prior felony convictions -- including one assault with a deadly 
weapon and two robberies -- Dorsey faces a minimum sentence under the new law 
of 25 years to life if convicted. Prior to the law, he would have faced a 
minimum sentence of six years, according to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just kept asking me over and over again how this could be. He just didn't 
understand. He didn't know anything about the law," Gast said. "I had to go 
back and tell this man that he is potentially facing 25 years to life . . . 
when he gets caught sitting in a stolen car." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the stolen pickup truck, Ewald Leverkus, 52, said he welcomes the 
prospect of Dorsey facing a long prison sentence. Leverkus, who lost his job 
last year as a bank loan manager, has been using the truck to look for a new 
job and to haul building materials while he bides his time by renovating his 
Fairfax-area home. 
</P>
<P>
 Leverkus said he does not consider car theft a major offense, but he said 
Dorsey's past convictions need to be considered. Moreover, it cost him $123 to 
get the truck back from a police impound yard, the truck was missing several 
tools and the ignition needs to be repaired because it had been damaged, 
Leverkus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system has been very lenient. Something had to happen," Leverkus said. 
"For me, $123 is more than I want to pay out for something like this. I would 
rather buy groceries." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the debate about the new law, signed by Gov. Pete Wilson on Monday, 
has split much of California, the Leverkus household was not of one mind 
Wednesday. Leverkus's wife, Cathy, described Dorsey's possible punishment as 
"really stiff" and predicted that the law would not solve the state's crime 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the answer is, but I would hope there would be a more 
humane way to deal with people," she said. "I know there were other possible 
(crime) bills being considered, and Wilson just jumped on this one too soon." 
</P>
<P>
 With the county's first two cases under the new law involving relatively minor 
crimes, some critics speculated that the district attorney's office was 
attempting to highlight the statute's apparent shortcomings. Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti opposed the new legislation but has said he will enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Harland Braun said Garcetti may be trying to make a point about 
"how absolutely insane this law is. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is almost a joke that someone is going to go away for life for stealing 50 
cents or sitting in a stolen car," Braun said. "You really wonder if we're 
living in a sane world anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. David R. Taum described Bentley and Dorsey as dangerous 
felons, and defended his office's decision to charge them under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were crimes committed against the people of California," Taum said. "I 
am not going to refuse to file these allegations because maybe the case could 
have been a little better here or a little better there." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola law school professor Laurie Levenson said the cases, despite involving 
rather minor crimes, make "exactly the point the proponents wanted: We don't 
allow you to continue to commit crimes. . . . If you win on this type of case, 
this law will be upheld on other more serious cases." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County public defender's office said Wednesday that it will 
begin reviewing cases filed under the new statute for possible appeals and 
challenges to its constitutionality. But Levenson and UCLA law professor Peter 
Arenella said that chances of success are very unlikely for any defense claim 
that a 25-year-to-life sentence for such crimes amounts to cruel and unusual 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no significant challenge that can be raised," Arenella said. "That 
doesn't mean this is wise penal policy. I think it is unwise penal policy." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento on Wednesday, the father and grandfather of 12-year-old Polly 
Klaas held a news conference to attack the new "three strikes" law and urge 
lawmakers and the governor to pass a more narrow bill aimed at locking up 
violent felons for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Klaas, father of the girl whose abduction and murder helped propel state 
legislators and Gov. Pete Wilson into passing and signing the new sentencing 
law, said it will cost too many billions because it will result in lengthy 
sentences for thousands of repeat felons who commit property crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas is backing a bill by Assemblyman Richard K. Rainey (R-Walnut Creek) that 
bears his daughter's name. The Polly Klaas bill, which is stalled in the 
Senate, would impose sentences of life in prison without parole on people who 
commit three violent crimes, and on two-time offenders who prey on children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Polly Klaas Foundation is 100% behind the Rainey bill because it is a 
tougher bill that targets the right people," said Klaas, the director of the 
foundation. "We're taking our case to the people and asking citizens to call 
the legislators and the governor." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on Wednesday, Klaas recalled speaking to Wilson on Friday to 
make one final plea that Wilson not sign the "three strikes" bill into law and 
throw his support behind the Rainey bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'This is a stronger bill,' " Klaas recalled. "The governor said, 'You 
don't know how victims' groups feel.' I said, 'Sir, I am a victim. I know how 
they feel.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas, who has been at Wilson's side often during the year, said the governor 
made no further response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he probably knew he said the wrong thing," Klaas said. "Maybe he 
forgot who he was talking to." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, there are four other so-called "three strikes" bills stalled in the 
Senate. They had been moving quickly through the Legislature earlier in the 
year. Now that the harshest of the measures is law, some lawmakers are waiting 
to see how it works before tinkering with the sentencing law. Wilson also is 
opposed to letting the bills move if they would water down the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers around the state said many clients fear the possibility of 
facing life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word has gotten out on the streets really fast. We've had a number of 
them asking us if this is in effect: 'Oh, my God, do I fall in that?' " Alameda 
County Public Defender Jay Gaskill said.

STATE TO RETROFIT BRIDGES FASTER; FREEWAYS: COLLAPSE OF SIX MAJOR ROADWAYS IN 
NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE PROMPTS THE ACCELERATION. MOST OF THE STRUCTURES AT RISK 
ARE IN L.A. AREA AND SOUTHLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jolted by the collapse of six major roadways in the Northridge earthquake, the 
Wilson Administration is preparing to order a major acceleration of its 
slow-moving seismic retrofitting program, pushing ahead by at least a year the 
strengthening of the state's most vulnerable bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Dunphy, secretary of the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, 
confirmed that he plans to announce today in Los Angeles a four-pronged plan to 
speed up work so that the strengthening of 1,000 top-priority bridges would be 
completed by late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these bridges considered at risk in a quake are in the Los Angeles 
Basin and elsewhere in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the important thing to realize at this point is that the governor is 
not satisfied with the progress (of the seismic program)," Dunphy said. "One 
hundred fourteen retrofitted bridges survived the Northridge quake. It's time 
to bring this level of seismic safety to every vulnerable bridge in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy said his plan would speed up the retrofitting of bridges primarily by 
requiring the California Department of Transportation to use emergency 
contracting procedures on all seismic projects -- a measure that the head of 
the agency had earlier rejected as unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision comes as lawmakers were preparing to pass legislation that would 
have forced the Administration to take many of the actions now being ordered by 
Dunphy. 
</P>
<P>
 The acceleration follows a Times special report last month which found that 
about 80% of the state's most earthquake-vulnerable bridges still had not been 
retrofitted more than four years after the collapse of highway structures in 
the Loma Prieta temblor killed 43. In Los Angeles County, retrofitting work has 
not been performed on six of the 10 freeway bridges considered most hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the six bridges that failed in the Northridge quake had been 
retrofitted, although five of them had been identified as vulnerable to 
earthquake damage. The sixth bridge, on the Simi Valley Freeway at San Fernando 
Mission Boulevard, was not deemed an earthquake risk. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed up the seismic program, the Administration's plan calls on the 
Legislature to remove some environmental and bureaucratic regulatory barriers 
that have slowed seismic projects. It directs the bureaucracy to make full use 
of outside contractors to complete engineering and design work. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy said an ombudsman will be appointed to work with local governments and 
utility companies to help remove any outside obstacles that could bog down 
seismic projects. Caltrans officials have complained that some retrofitting 
projects have been held up because utility companies and local governments have 
been slow to approve work that might affect facilities such as gas or 
electrical transmission lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy said the over $1 billion cost of the freeway retrofitting program would 
come from the state highway account, which is supported primarily by gasoline 
tax revenues. He said Gov. Pete Wilson envisions that $650 million for the 
retrofitting of toll bridges will be paid for out of toll revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the Senate 
Transportation Committee, said he would block any effort to use toll revenues 
for retrofitting and will fight to have that cost borne by gasoline tax 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Katz, (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, 
said he favors use of toll revenues for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the Wilson Administration should not get credit for accelerating a 
program that had been allowed to lag nearly two years behind the deadlines the 
Legislature set for it after the Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you essentially have is an election year acceleration of a program that 
will be accelerated so that it's only a year behind schedule," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Katz acknowledged that the Legislature would probably approve most of 
what the Administration is requesting -- in part because many of the proposals 
are already contained in legislation -- he criticized the plan for not going 
far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 He said appointing an ombudsman did not make up for the fact that the 
Administration had never put a high-profile official in charge of the 
retrofitting program with direct responsibility for ensuring that projects were 
completed on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, he said, the Administration's plan does not specify how additional 
seismic projects would be handled once the 1,000 top-priority bridges are 
retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the collapse of six bridges in the Northridge quake, Caltrans 
officials have decided to re-examine about 1,500 bridges they had previously 
determined were seismically safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these bridges were constructed in the 1970s -- when Caltrans officials 
believed their bridges were designed with enough strengthening details to 
withstand earthquakes. But the collapse of the Simi Valley Freeway bridge, an 
overpass completed in 1976, has prompted them to reconsider that assumption and 
review all bridges constructed in that decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials have said they expect to know by the end of June, when the 
screening of the additional 1,500 bridges is completed, how many more will need 
to be retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy said he envisions that all bridge retrofitting projects -- whether they 
be on the original list of 1,000 or on a new list created by the screening of 
the additional 1,500 structures -- will be expedited. He said retrofitting 
work, for example, on the state's toll bridges -- most of which are in the San 
Francisco Bay Area -- would be completed by 1997 now, instead of 1998 as 
originally scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he saw no need to appoint a special manager for the seismic program 
because he intends to take personal responsibility for seeing that deadlines 
are met and the governor is apprised of its progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this governor's interest and my interest, I am happy to delegate myself 
the responsibility of making sure that it stays on track," said Dunphy, a 
former construction company owner. "I know when a project is on time and when 
it is not and how you tweak it and how you kick somebody in the butt to get it 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy acknowledged that Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels was "probably 
wrong" when he determined earlier that it would not be necessary to utilize 
emergency contracting powers to complete the remaining seismic projects. But he 
insisted that van Loben Sels was now a strong supporter of the plan to 
accelerate the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Loben Sels, he said, "wants to make sure that it gets done as well and all 
of this is being done cooperatively," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy took issue with Katz's contention that the Administration had been slow 
to expedite the seismic program, saying the governor had made clear shortly 
after the Northridge quake that he would announce a plan to speed up 
retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I may be so bold, I would suggest that possibly the Legislature might be 
following what the governor was planning to do," he said. "But I don't think 
this is a who-came-in-first game. The governor seriously is seeking the most 
appropriate way to (accelerate the program)."

CHARLES BUKOWSKI DIES; POET OF L.A.'S LOW-LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Bukowski, the prolific writer and poet laureate of Los Angeles 
low-life whose rough-hewn autobiographical poems, short stories, novels and 
1987 film "Barfly" chronicled his hard-bitten alcoholic youth, died Wednesday. 
He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski, a cult favorite in Europe even before he achieved fame at home, died 
of leukemia at San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, said his wife, Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that although he had suffered from the disease for about a year he 
had worked until recently. A book of his letters titled "Screams From the 
Balcony" was published a few months ago, and a new book of poetry, "Pulp," is 
scheduled to be published in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I die," he told The Times in an interview in 1987, "I hope I go with my 
head on that typewriter. It's my battlefield." 
</P>
<P>
 Considered the leader of the tough, masculine "Meat School poets," Bukowski 
reveled in subjects thought best left alone by more genteel contemporaries -- 
sex, violence, alcohol abuse. Yet he wrote and spoke in the sweet, syncopated 
rhythms that unquestionably are labeled poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been run over, beaten up, jailed -- I've picked up a lot of baggage 
along the way, everything from ex-wives to ex-jobs," he said in 1987 after 
"Barfly" won him interviews in the national media. "I've always been worried 
about my damn soul -- maybe I worry too much. But you carry in one hand a 
bundle of darkness that accumulates each day. And when death finally comes, you 
say right away, 'Hey, buddy, glad to see ya!' " 
</P>
<P>
 A surprisingly disciplined and prolific writer in spite of his hard-drinking, 
womanizing, gambler persona, Bukowski published more than 1,000 poems, 32 books 
of poetry, five books of short stories, half a dozen novels and the screenplay. 
More than 2 million copies of his books are in print, most of them translated 
into languages ranging from French to Greek to Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski's hero frequently was his alter ego Henry Chinaski, a hard-drinking, 
womanizing, gambling writer who stumbles between bars and odd jobs. Chinaski 
was played by actor Mickey Rourke in "Barfly," which concentrated on three days 
in Bukowski's life at the age of 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Said to have mellowed in his later years -- switching from hard liquor to good 
red wine and swallowing 40 vitamin pills a day -- Bukowski had lived the rough 
life he so wittingly described. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Andernach, Germany, in 1920, he moved to the United States with his 
family as a toddler, living first in Baltimore, then Pasadena and eventually 
Los Angeles. His stern father beat him with a razor strop for even minor 
infractions, causing such stress that the child developed widespread boils that 
scarred his complexion for life. 
</P>
<P>
 (Writer Paul Ciotti described him in a 1987 Los Angeles Times Magazine article 
as having "a sandblasted face, warts on his eyelids and a dominating nose that 
looks as if it was assembled in a junkyard from Studebaker hoods and Buick 
fenders.") 
</P>
<P>
 A small boy, young Bukowski was bullied by other boys and rejected by girls, 
attracting only what he described as "idiot friends." At age 13, he discovered 
alcohol -- the answer to beatings, boils, and rejection -- in the family wine 
cellar of one of those friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was magic," he later wrote. "Why hadn't someone told me?" 
</P>
<P>
 In 1939, Bukowski enrolled at Los Angeles City College to study journalism and 
English. But he soon became disillusioned and dropped out, moving to New York 
and then Philadelphia to become a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Excused from the draft as "too antisocial," he continued writing and 
collecting rejection slips from Atlantic Monthly and Harper's magazine until 
1946. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in his own words, "I said the hell with it, I'll just concentrate on 
drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski spent the next decade on a drunken binge, roaming the country and 
gathering experience. In 1955, he wound up in County-USC Medical Center with a 
bleeding ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed to die and didn't," he said later. "So I started writing 
again. But instead of short stories, it came out as poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 His first book of poetry -- all 30 pages and 200 copies of it -- was "Flower, 
Fist and Bestial Wail," published in 1959. When "It Catches My Heart in Its 
Hands: New and Selected Poems, 1955-63" was published in greater quantity in 
1963, Bukowski found himself the sought-after darling of underground poetry 
magazines and local papers like the L.A. Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
 How much of Bukowski's harsh manner was mere showmanship -- or salesmanship -- 
is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 He recognized when he began to write that a poet must be noticed in order to 
be read and later recounted: "I got my act up. I wrote vile but interesting 
stuff that made people hate me, that made them curious about this Bukowski. I 
threw bodies off my porch into the night. I sneered at hippies. I was in and 
out of drunk tanks. A lady accused me of rape." 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski attracted the attention of John Martin, who founded Black Sparrow 
Press in 1965 specifically to publish him. 
</P>
<P>
 As a fledgling writer, Bukowski made little money and continued to work at odd 
jobs -- dishwasher, truck driver, guard, gas station attendant, shipping clerk, 
parking lot attendant, elevator operator, worker in dog biscuit, cake and 
cookie factories and, perhaps most permanently, as a mail sorter with the U.S. 
Postal Service at Terminal Annex in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 After Martin offered him $100 a month to quit and write full-time in 1969, 
Bukowski turned that last experience into his first novel, "Post Office," 
published in 1971. It sold 75,000 copies in the United States and 500,000 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 To expand his income, Bukowski wrote for such questionable literary 
publications as Hustler. He even started a short-lived magazine of his own 
called "Laugh Literary and Man the Humping Guns," and earned $200 a night 
staging raucous poetry readings that often turned into drunken brawls. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski's titles usually warned unwary readers what to expect. Typical were 
the short stories "Notes of a Dirty Old Man," based on his underground columns, 
and "Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions and General Tales of Ordinary 
Madness," in which the New York Review of Books noted that Bukowski wrote "as 
an unregenerate low-brow contemptuous of our claims to superior being." 
</P>
<P>
 No experience was lost on Bukowski throughout his life. When he hobnobbed with 
Rourke, actress Faye Dunaway and other Hollywood celebrities during the making 
of "Barfly," he turned that into his sixth novel, "Hollywood," published in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski's screenplay, like the rest of his work, offered remarkable insight 
into life as well as into the author. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever its flaws," wrote Times film critic Michael Wilmington, " 'Barfly' 
does something more films should do: It opens up territory, opens up a human 
being. The worst of it has the edge of coughed-up whimsy and barroom bragging. 
But the best has the shock of truth and the harsh sweet kiss of dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 The autobiographical writings eventually attracted biographers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Barbet Schroeder produced a two-hour videotape for French television 
(later shown here) titled "Charles Bukowski." 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1991, Neeli Cherkovski published a biography, "A Tough Guy from L.A. -- 
The Life of Charles Bukowski." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bukowski is the possessor of a strong, disturbing voice that has led his 
ardent admirers to consider his poetry among today's best and to compare his 
tough-guy prose to that of Ernest Hemingway. Yet he has long been dismissed as 
only a 'Los Angeles writer,' " noted author and USC teacher John Rechy in 
reviewing Cherkovski's book. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Bukowski) does not fit neatly within the boundaries of literary 
acceptability," Rechy said. "Though celebrated abroad, in America his work is 
still begrudged respectful attention by the tomes that purport to establish 
literary importance." 
</P>
<P>
 If mainstream literature rejected Bukowski, he nevertheless collected such 
awards as a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1974, the Loujon Press 
Award and the Silver Reel Award from the San Francisco Festival of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 And until the end of his life, Bukowski said it all came easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wine does most of my writing," he said in his late 60s. "I just open a 
bottle and turn on the radio, and it just comes pouring out. I only type every 
third night. I have no plan. My mind is a blank. I sit down. The typewriter 
gives me things I don't even know I'm working on. It's a free lunch. A free 
dinner. I don't know how long it is going to continue, but so far there is 
nothing easier than writing." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Bukowski is survived by a daughter, Marina, of 
Seattle.

PUBLIC FEES FOR ABRAMSON IN MENENDEZ CASE DENIED; COURTS: JUDGE SAYS SHE MUST 
HONOR CONTRACT EVEN IF CLIENT IS BROKE. SHE SAYS SHE 'CANNOT AFFORD TO GO 
BANKRUPT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Wednesday refused to grant lawyer Leslie Abramson taxpayer money to 
defend accused murderer Erik Menendez in a second trial, declaring that it was 
not his concern if she took on a client who says he has run out of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson -- who became a national celebrity for her aggressive style in the 
first trial of Erik and Lyle Menendez, which ended in hung juries after six 
months -- immediately told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Cecil Mills that 
she would ask to be removed from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she remains loyal to Erik Menendez, whom she has doted on in court. 
She picked lint off his sweaters and wrapped her arms around his shoulders so 
often that Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg, who presided over 
the first trial, ordered her to stop the touching, reminding her that lawyers 
are not "nursemaids" or "surrogate mothers." 
</P>
<P>
 She rubbed Menendez's back Wednesday. But she said, "I cannot afford to go 
bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, who has built a statewide reputation for engineering a novel policy 
that limits lawyers' fees in death penalty cases, said Abramson signed a 
contract to defend Erik Menendez -- and remains bound by it even if it was a 
"bad business deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract clearly states that Abramson agreed to represent the younger 
Menendez brother at "guilt and penalty phase trials," Mills said, emphasizing 
the plural and noting the upcoming retrial of both Menendez brothers. In 
exchange, he paid her $740,000, according to court records. Her fee, Mills 
said, was "anything but insubstantial." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Menendez, 23, and Lyle Menendez, 26, who face a second trial in the 1989 
shotgun slayings of their parents, say that the $14-million Menendez estate is 
virtually depleted, leaving them broke. But Mills told Abramson that taxpayers 
have no obligation to "bail you out on this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 As the hearing ended, Abramson hedged on what she will do, leaving it unclear 
whether she will stay on -- and earn nothing at a second trial but the sort of 
national publicity most lawyers crave. Weisberg has scheduled a hearing next 
Wednesday to set a new trial date. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson remained quiet Wednesday after the hearing. "I'm going to let you 
guys write this all by yourselves," she told reporters who piled into an 
elevator with her. "I'm not going to say a word." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Erik Menendez may have left Abramson with no option but to represent 
him for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules of legal ethics typically do not allow a criminal defense lawyer to 
withdraw from a case simply because the client has run out of cash -- 
especially when the client wants the lawyer to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Wednesday, Erik Menendez pleaded with Mills: "I am begging this court 
to compensate my attorney to represent me. There is no way I'd want to go to 
trial without her representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel I could open my life up to another attorney," Erik Menendez 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Menendez," Mills said, "I haven't relieved your attorney. She is your 
attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills did grant permission Wednesday to Jill Lansing, who represented Lyle 
Menendez at the first trial, to leave the case. She had announced a few weeks 
ago that she wanted to spend more time with a young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it difficult to comprehend how this court can allow one attorney to 
leave the case and force another to work for free," Abramson told Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference, the judge said, is that Lyle Menendez said Lansing's departure 
was OK with him. Mills appointed the public defender's office to the older 
brother's case. Deputies Bill Weiss and Terri Towery have been assigned to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson asked Mills for $100 per hour for a second trial, up to $250,000, 
although she said that self-imposed cap was perhaps "too low." 
</P>
<P>
 Her request would have flouted a new county policy that pays private attorneys 
a flat fee for the defense of death penalty cases. The new policy, approved by 
the County Board of Supervisors in November, 1992, replaced a traditional plan 
of paying attorneys by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills pushed hard for a flat-fee policy when he took over in 1992 as 
supervising judge of the county's criminal courts. It pays attorneys either 
$60,000, $90,000, $125,000 or $200,000 and up for a case, depending on the 
complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the per-hour plan, the average cost for a death penalty case had been 
slightly more than $300,000 per year per defendant, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Menendez case was projected to be a $90,000 or $125,000 case, legal 
experts said. In practice, the $200,000-plus fee is reserved for the defense of 
serial killers, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, however, emphasized that Erik Menendez and Abramson still have a valid 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge asked the younger brother: "Did you really anticipate that at some 
point, halfway through the proceedings, or perhaps less, she'd say, 'No, I 
don't want to represent you because you don't have any more money' ?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Another trial was never anticipated," Erik Menendez, dressed in jailhouse 
blues, responded from the lectern. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson immediately took back the lectern and proclaimed: "I don't like the 
inference that somehow I'm a money grubber or that I made a bad business deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Unmoved, the judge said: "My ruling will stand." 
</P>
<P>
 If she wishes, Abramson can appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, according to probate court and county records, the brothers' defense 
has cost about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate of the slain parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty Menendez, 47, 
paid $755,000 to defend Erik Menendez and $740,000 to defend Lyle Menendez. The 
brothers say they killed in fear after years of abuse. Prosecutors contend it 
was hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate paid $15,000 to attorney Robert Shapiro, who arranged for Erik 
Menendez's surrender to police in March, 1990, seven months after the sons 
killed the parents. Abramson has been Erik Menendez's chief defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing's share of the $740,000 fee has never been disclosed. Lyle Menendez 
had two prior lawyers, Joel R. Isaacson and Gerald Chaleff. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers paid an additional $499,562 in lawyers' fees, according to a March 3 
county report. Because death penalty cases are so complex, it is not uncommon 
for the public to pay for additional defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles M. Sevilla, a San Diego lawyer, made $1,065 to advise Lyle Menendez 
during the trial, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Burt, a San Francisco public defender who was Lansing's co-counsel, 
earned $311,175 for his full-time work on the case. Mills formally removed him 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills also ruled Wednesday that if Abramson goes forward with the second 
trial, it will be without co-counsel Marcia Morrissey, who earned $187,322 to 
defend Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Abramson is familiar with the case, there's "no further justification" 
for a second lawyer, Mills said.

ACCORD WOULD TOUGHEN AUTO SMOG TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State and federal officials reached agreement Wednesday on a plan to toughen 
California's automobile Smog Check program by requiring 15% of the cars in the 
state to be checked at specialized inspection-only facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who own the remaining 85% of vehicles, smog inspections would remain 
virtually unchanged, with visits to neighborhood garages every two years for 
tests and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise appeared to represent a substantial retreat by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, which had threatened to cut off federal 
highway funds unless the state agreed to require that all testing be done at 
inspection-only facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Service station owners applauded the agreement and said it would save their 
businesses. Several environmentalists questioned whether the compromise program 
would clean the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has been facing a deadline under federal clean air laws for 
toughening its Smog Check program. Critics contend the current system weeds out 
only about 25% of the dirty cars tested. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials, including Gov. Pete Wilson, resisted the EPA demand when 
operators of the state's 9,000 licensed Smog Check stations warned of massive 
layoffs. Over the last few months, the state and the EPA have worked to reach a 
compromise. The agreement announced Wednesday would erase the threat of federal 
sanctions against the state for continued failure to comply with the Clean Air 
Act, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is subject to approval by two-thirds of the Legislature, the 
governor and the signing of a memorandum of understanding by state officials 
and by federal EPA Administrator Carol Browner. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program fails to fulfill expectations, it likely would be subject to 
renegotiation, legislative action or lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a compromise that EPA is happy with and California is happy with," 
said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), the lead legislative negotiator who 
has sought for more than a year to reach a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise was swiftly written into legislation and unanimously approved 
by an Assembly-Senate conference committee Wednesday. It probably will be voted 
on by both houses of the Legislature next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, drivers of 15% of the cars due for smog tests in 1995 would be 
routed into inspection-only shops for scrutiny. The vehicles would have to meet 
the same clean air standards as other cars, but those requiring repairs as a 
result of those inspections would be sent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Those targeted for inspection-only facilities would be autos whose smog 
controls had been tampered with, high-mileage fleet vehicles such as taxis, 
especially heavy polluters and a 2% sample of vehicles randomly selected by the 
Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he believes there will be no increase in costs to motorists at 
inspection-only stations even though automobiles would be tested by more 
sophisticated equipment. He said that the increased cost of the equipment would 
be offset by the program's proposed efficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcement of the settlement appeared to take environmental advocates by 
surprise. Veronica Kun of the Natural Resources Defense Council said she was 
startled that the EPA agreed to the 15% provision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly a step back from what EPA wanted before," she said. "It 
sounds to me as if EPA has compromised much more than the legislative leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for us to have the kind of program we need, there has to be some 
pretty strong compensations to make up for the fact that only 15% of the cars 
are going through the more rigorous tests," Kun said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Tom Soto of the Coalition for Clean Air said given the political 
reality in Sacramento, the settlement probably is the best that can be 
expected. "This at least breaks the gridlock. It looks as though it is 
something generally we can live with." 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise drew the support of a service station trade association. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement also calls for an experimental high-tech roadside sensor system 
to be tried in an effort to detect and identify California's dirtiest cars. The 
EPA earlier had expressed skepticism of such a system. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, an EPA spokeswoman for Browner said, "We are very encouraged 
and if the Legislature passes the legislation we fully expect to sign the 
memorandum of understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a spokesman for James Strock, secretary of Wilson's California EPA 
who helped negotiate the settlement, praised it as a "good deal for 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 The memorandum commits the state and federal governments to work cooperatively 
to bring California into compliance with federal clean air standards. Katz said 
the unusual written commitment was necessary to express the agreement because 
no legislative enactment of California is binding on the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resolution of this issue is extraordinary and apparently unprecedented," 
Katz said. He forecast that the accord would both clean up the skies and 
protect the jobs of mechanics who perform inspections and make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was reached in the wake of passage in January of a major bill 
signed by Wilson that overhauled the ailing California Smog Check system. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Katz had insisted that the new law would meet federal standards, 
but the EPA said it fell far short of doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the EPA announced its intent to withhold federal highway funds 
from California. The announcement was reversed shortly after the Northridge 
earthquake when President Clinton pledged to do all he could to help Southern 
California recover. 
</P>
<P>
 In signing the law over an appeal by Browner to veto it, Wilson said in 
January that he was willing to renew negotiations in an effort to find a 
compromise.

HEBRON GUNMAN CARRIED CONFESSION, PANEL IS TOLD; MASSACRE: COMMISSION ASKS TO 
SEE LETTER ARMY OFFICER SAYS WAS IN KILLER'S BAG. POSSIBILITY OF COVER-UP IS 
RAISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Israeli settler who massacred about 30 Palestinians as they prayed here in 
a mosque two weeks ago brought with him, in the same bag with his extra 
ammunition, a confession explaining his motives, the army officer on duty at 
the site said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Second Lt. Rotem Ravivi told a special commission investigating the Feb. 25 
attack that he found "a letter of confession" in Dr. Baruch Goldstein's purple 
flight bag after worshipers had overpowered the killer and beaten him to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two letters from Goldstein to city officials and other physicians in 
Kiryat Arba, the settlement where he lived and worked, had obliquely hinted at 
his plans and had been released quickly, the confession found at the Cave of 
the Patriarchs here had never been disclosed, though a confidential army report 
referred to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Justice Meir Shamgar, commission chairman, called upon the army to 
produce the confession when the commission resumes its hearings in Jerusalem 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosure of the confession and other information that emerged in the panel's 
daylong inspection of the shrine here raised anew the possibility of an 
attempted cover-up by the Israeli military. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the army investigation, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and other 
Israeli leaders have described Goldstein as "crazy," "a lunatic" and "one man 
acting alone," rather than a member of an underground group of Jewish 
extremists determined to upset peace negotiations with the Palestinians and 
thus prevent Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But even early testimony by witnesses has indicated that Goldstein acted with 
premeditation, careful planning -- and perhaps not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian leaders have already suggested that Israeli soldiers, or perhaps 
other settlers in uniform, may also have been part of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 According to soldiers on duty that Friday, Goldstein was driven to the shrine 
by an unidentified man before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 He was dressed in a uniform and carried seven magazines of ammunition for his 
assault rifle -- a full load for foot soldiers in the troubled West Bank but an 
extraordinary amount for an army doctor. Around his neck he wore the type of 
ear protectors used on firing ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions also arose Wednesday about how Goldstein managed to slip around 
Ravivi into the Muslim side of the shrine, whether Goldstein had entered 
through another door that had been left unlocked and how Goldstein left the 
flight bag in a hall where 13 Jewish men were praying without any seeing him. 
</P>
<P>
 And why, local Muslim leaders asked the commission, did the Israeli military 
governor of Hebron order the mosque cleansed of blood -- and perhaps much 
physical evidence -- with high-powered fire hoses just before the commission 
began its investigation? They had asked, they said, that everything be left as 
it was to allow a full, independent inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Guarded by hundreds of soldiers, the commission inspected the Ibrahim Mosque 
at the Cave of the Patriarchs and other sites in Hebron for seven hours 
Wednesday, retracing Goldstein's path, step by step, through the murder at the 
shrine, then following the spread of riots through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the massacre, the public has been barred from the Cave of the 
Patriarchs, a shrine holy to Jews and Muslims as the traditional burial place 
of such biblical figures as Abraham, Sarah, Isaac and Jacob. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers from half a dozen different Israeli divisions, along with 
paramilitary border troops and police, were stationed on roofs and in the 
streets near the 2,000-year-old Cave of the Patriarchs and throughout central 
Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 Streets were deserted because of an army-imposed curfew that has kept the 
city's 70,000 Palestinians at home since the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 journalists were allowed in the shrine but barred from Isaac's Hall, 
where the massacre occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts of the visit and testimony were provided later by the Israeli news 
agency Itim, the Government Press Office and the Justice Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravivi told the commission that he saw Goldstein enter the door to Abraham 
Hall, where Jews pray, and from which it is possible to enter Isaac Hall, where 
Muslims pray. Ravivi did not keep his eyes on Goldstein and so could not say 
how he entered Isaac Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 When he heard shooting, Ravivi continued, he tried to enter Isaac Hall but was 
blocked, finding two doors locked and the third filled with a crush of people 
trying to escape the firing. It took three minutes from the start of shooting 
until the incident was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians living adjacent to the shrine, some of whom had been praying 
there at the time of the massacre, came out of their houses to offer versions 
of events that conflicted sharply with that provided by the Israeli military. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 50 were killed -- we saw their bodies, we went to their funerals," 
one woman said. A neighbor added: "It was not Goldstein alone -- we saw the 
soldiers shooting too." 
</P>
<P>
 The army investigation put the number of people killed by Goldstein in the 
mosque at 29. Three more were trampled to death in the effort to flee, the army 
found, and five were killed by soldiers in the ensuing riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestine Human Rights Information Center put the deaths at 48 at the 
mosque and five later in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We doubt that this commission is interested in the truth," said Zleikha 
Muhtaseb, 30, a teacher. "They are Jews, and Jews will never do any harm to 
their people. Still, I will testify about what I saw that day because the truth 
requires it. Let's see if they listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Muhtaseb, who was in the adjacent chapel for Muslim women when Goldstein 
started shooting, said she saw from the doorway at least four soldiers shooting 
Palestinians in Isaac Hall. The Israeli army has said all 110 cartridges it 
found in the mosque came from Goldstein's rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Muslim leaders promised Shamgar that Hebron residents who were at the 
Cave of the Patriarchs or around it on the day of the massacre will testify 
during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the commission's opening hearing Tuesday, Maj. Gen. Danny Yatom, acting 
commander of Israeli forces throughout central Israel and the West Bank, 
testified that, had the full complement of soldiers and police been present in 
the Cave of the Patriarchs that morning, Goldstein's attack could have been 
prevented or quickly halted. But five men were missing -- three overslept, one 
had been reassigned and one rarely came. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to a severe breach in discipline, or for some other reason not yet known, 
the (shrine) was, in effect, abandoned at a most critical moment," Zeev Schiff, 
Israel's leading military commentator, wrote Wednesday in the influential 
newspaper Haaretz. "This fact will undoubtedly add to the wave of rumors among 
the Arabs according to which Goldstein did not act alone and that there may 
have been a conspiracy to carry out the deed."

COLUMN ONE; WOMEN UNITE, GIVE INDIA A JOLT; GRASS-ROOTS GROUPS HAVE SPRUNG UP 
IN RURAL VILLAGES WITH HOPES OF MAKING BRUTISH LIVES BETTER. THEY CUT THROUGH 
THE NOTORIOUS BUREAUCRACY WITH A SIMPLE PHILOSOPHY -- DON'T WAIT FOR THE MEN TO 
ACT.

 In the Madurai district, they still talk with wonder about how the women of 
this village, miles from the nearest paved road, dared take things into their 
own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadachipatti has only one pump for drinking water, and it frequently breaks 
down. When villagers complain, it takes as long as five days for authorities to 
send somebody to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the women have to trudge a quarter of a mile to a canal, fill up 
their heavy five-gallon water jars and lug them back on their heads under the 
fiery sun. 
</P>
<P>
 One momentous day four months back, years, or more likely whole centuries, of 
stoic patience snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time, we got so fed up we decided to do it for ourselves," Shanti, 25, 
proudly recalls. The mother of three at first glance has nothing of the 
revolutionary about her. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding they had to depend on their own efforts, the 32 members of the 
women's council of the poor farming village collected two rupees -- about six 
cents -- from each member, and had two high school graduates fetch the needed 
parts and fix the pump. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sadachipatti and the surrounding area, that humble but measurable stab at 
what the theorists of social work call "empowerment" was an earthquake that 
made men, who run things around here, sit up and take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody had told me 10 years ago that this would happen, I would have 
laughed at him," marveled Krishnaswamy Rajivan, who has a doctorate in 
economics from USC and is district collector, or chief government official, for 
the Madurai area. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the southeastern state of Tamil Nadu, no fewer than 24,000 women's 
groups are endeavoring to better the often-brutish lives of more than 26 
million women, sometimes with dazzling success. Most busy themselves with 
traditional women's duties such as child rearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater literacy, the radicalizing presence of some Christian denominations 
and an ambitious state program to feed lunch to every schoolchild has meant 
that there is more grass-roots women's activity here than in many states. But 
across the country, often thanks to government funds or foreign donations, 
women have banded together to try to solve their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka, a government-sponsored program 
called Education for Women's Equality teaches women their rights, birth 
control, where to get legal aid and what they are entitled to in terms of land 
and property when they marry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't give them total literacy. It's consciousness-raising," explained 
Ritu Menon, co-founder of the New Delhi-based Kali for Women publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sadachipatti and countless other dusty, out-of-the-way places throughout 
the peninsula, grass-roots mobilization by women after generations of passive 
acceptance of life's hardships is often the sole alternative to official aid 
that probably will not materialize anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any government official who comes here is after money," Yogaraj, a former 
army NCO with a magnificent handlebar mustache and paunch who is now a rural 
village chief, says in a verdict that allows no appeal. "They cannot expect any 
help from the government." 
</P>
<P>
 This is empowerment at its most basic, tackling problems -- such as a faulty 
pump -- that relatively few women's groups in the United States or other 
Western countries have ever faced. Women here who have sought education or 
dedicated themselves to improving the lives of their countrywomen may sometimes 
have sacrificed their chances for marriage and a family. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, there are parallels with other, richer countries. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if American women have had to battle banks and private companies 
for the right to have their own charge and bank accounts, in rural Tamil Nadu 
they have had to circumvent usurious moneylenders. 
</P>
<P>
 To break the usurers' power, and to secure access to credit and the clout it 
carries, Sadachipatti's women created their own savings bank, and socked away 
8,000 rupees, or about $260 -- a fortune here. They lend money to members of 
the women's union at 3%, instead of the moneylenders' 10%. And this is no 
isolated example. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Usilampatti subdistrict 25 miles west of Madurai, women's 
savings cooperatives now boast more than $55,000 in combined assets. At 
meetings, the women decide whom to lend money for the purchase of milch 
animals, a shop or farmland. The co-ops' default rate is an impressively low 
2%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their board minutes would put Westinghouse or AT&T to shame," an admiring 
Rajivan says. 
</P>
<P>
 These are all beacons of encouraging change in what, for India's poor rural 
women, is an otherwise bleak landscape. Last month, 600 delegates from 
throughout the nation convened in New Delhi to hold the All India Women's 
Conference, an event sponsored by the country's extreme left. They reeled off a 
gruesome, state-by-state litany of problems: rape, molestation, sexual 
harassment, wife-beating, discrimination, murder of wives because their 
husbands were not content with the dowries they brought. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent and alarming trend, delegates reported, is the parading of village 
women naked through the streets to shame them, as happened to an impoverished 
woman in January in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Her offense: Her son 
had slapped a boy from a higher caste for stealing some peas. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the conference was a sober time for taking stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Indian women's activists and feminists say the seminal moment for them 
came when the United Nations announced its "Decade for Women" in 1975. Since 
then, Indian women have amassed enough influence and stirred sufficient debate 
so that a national Commission for Women was set up two years ago. There is some 
talk about reserving 33% of positions in political parties for women. 
</P>
<P>
 But activists such as Menon say it is not enough to change laws or claim a 
share of cushy jobs. India's constitution already guarantees women equality 
before the law. What's also needed is to change women's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus of Delhi University -- where the leftist-sponsored conference took 
place with its ardent rhetoric about the "fascist forces" of sexism -- is a 
long, long way from Sadachipatti, population 870. There, goatherds coax their 
flocks down dusty, unpaved roads, and the rare spectacle of an arriving 
automobile brings barefoot children on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, members of the women's council assembled eagerly to talk 
about their famous deed. As they sat on the earthen floor of a dimly lit, 
single-story whitewashed bungalow made of sunbaked mud, whose threshold was 
chalked with arabesques to ward off evil, a visitor asked them why only they, 
and not the village menfolk too, had raised a fuss about the pump. After all, 
don't men drink water too? 
</P>
<P>
 That question, the product of a logic so alien to the sexual division of labor 
that has prevailed here for centuries, seemed to startle the women. It was like 
asking why the village men do not give birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, water is essential for a woman to run her house," explained a 
middle-aged woman who wore a jewel-encrusted stud in each nostril. "To cook 
food, to clean, a woman needs water. A man doesn't need water for his work. He 
works in the fields." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sadachipatti, women's work includes scrounging for firewood and bringing 
great bundles home on their heads to cook with. 
</P>
<P>
 Women troop out to the nearest paved road, the hardest and flattest place 
around, to thresh rice and millet against the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most of the rural women's groups created by government impetus in 
Tamil Nadu deal with matters that have traditionally been the affairs of women: 
family nutrition and the rearing of children. 
</P>
<P>
 But others take a wider view. Such is the hidebound conservatism of the Indian 
village that if it was not for those outside forces, Sadachipatti's public pump 
with the long metal handle still might be out of order. The women's forum here 
was founded only because of the Madurai-based Meyer Trust, which engages in 
humanitarian and rural development work across Tamil Nadu. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for a German textile magnate and philanthropist who was an admirer of 
Mohandas K. Gandhi, the independent but government-funded Meyer Trust sent two 
supervisors here a year and a half ago. They were looking for an educated woman 
to serve as "animator" for a woman's group and found Meena Surileenadam, 24, 
who has a college degree in economics. She canvassed her fellow villagers, and 
the forum was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy that they are able to achieve things they once depended on 
others for," Surileenadam said. "I'm just sorry they didn't do this before." 
</P>
<P>
 In the roadside town of Chellampatti, another non-government agency financed 
by the proceeds from one generous woman's five-acre farm plot tries to teach 
village girls and women about their rights and to widen their job 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are also human beings. They are doing the same thing as men in the 
fields. Why should they suffer?" asked Nallamayan Logamani, the gentle-mannered 
founder of the Women's Emancipation and Development Trust and the daughter of 
its benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, as cows munched hay outside its single-story headquarters, a 
small class of teen-age girls inside learned how to use treadle-powered sewing 
machines. The trust has given sewing machines to village families to help them 
earn a livelihood, and it stood as guarantor so that families could get loans 
to buy cows or goats. 
</P>
<P>
 By the unwritten rules of Indian society, Logamani, 32 -- who has a master's 
degree in political science and a bachelor's in education, and can type in 
English and Tamil -- should have tried to get as far away from here as 
possible, to glamorous Bombay or Madras. Yet the Tamil woman returned to her 
native land. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard people were coming from far away to help us, I wondered, why not 
we ourselves?" she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The development trust tries to combat the rape of female fieldworkers by 
landowners, a widespread practice that Logamani said is her greatest concern. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization sends its three paid counselors into villages to sound out 
women on their problems, teach them their legal rights and dispense advice. 
("Have no more than two or three children" is high on the list). It also 
organizes groups of 30 or so village women into local chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 For a woman with no one else to turn to, the trust can be a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hamlet of Karugapilai, for instance, a husband who suspected his wife 
of adultery kicked her out of the house. The trust forum called on the man and 
told him: "Your wife is innocent. Take her back, or we will force you to." 
Confronted by so many determined women, the husband gave in. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a score of you are vouching for my wife's character," he said, "she must 
be blameless." 
</P>
<P>
 Logamani, a onetime elementary school teacher with fine features and a long, 
black braid, sometimes looks weary and sad; she is a reminder that the 1980s 
Western feminist ideal of "having it all" doesn't translate yet into rural 
Tamil dialect. 
</P>
<P>
 She is past the age when women of her Hindu sub-caste, the Kallars, usually 
marry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am nowadays so involved that I don't even think about marriage," she 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in conversation, she admitted that the ironclad social traditions she is 
trying to demolish for the good of other women may have left her little choice 
in her own life. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tamil society, a woman with a master's degree is marriageable only to a man 
with an equivalent or higher education. And because he is considered a prize 
catch, his family would demand a high dowry. Her parents, Logamani said, might 
not have been able to afford the rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Logamani gets no pay for the work she does. Funds, though, now seem to be 
running short. 
</P>
<P>
 When the women's activist went to officials of the Tamil Nadu state government 
to solicit help, they demanded a bribe, another aid worker disclosed. The 
future of the Women's Emancipation and Development Trust appears shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 Logamani mentioned nothing of this to a journalist who visited her modest 
office. In the room outside, the sewing machines hummed as girls learned the 
tricks of the tailoring trade. Her guest, who was about to leave, asked if she 
didn't think that India is an unhappy place to be born a woman. Her answer, 
full of optimism, burst out of her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to a particular individual," Logamani said confidently. "All women 
don't have to feel that way."

WILSON OPPOSES DELETIONS IN READING TEST; EDUCATION: HE WRITES TO AUTHOR WHOSE 
WORK WAS DROPPED AND ASKS HER TO RECONSIDER ACCEPTING A STATE AWARD. GOVERNOR 
ALSO CRITICIZES OFFICIALS WHO MADE THE DECISION. 
</P>

<P>
 Seeking to put an end to a mounting controversy over censorship, Gov. Pete 
Wilson on Wednesday told award-winning writer Alice Walker he does not endorse 
a decision by the State Board of Education to drop stories by Walker and 
another Pulitzer Prize winner from state reading tests. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter, Wilson also appealed to Walker, author of "The Color Purple," to 
reconsider her decision to decline a gubernatorial arts award because her 
stories were pulled from the new statewide tests for high school sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate, strongly worded letter to State Board of Education President 
Marion McDowell and Acting Supt. of Public Instruction William D. Dawson, 
Wilson said: "We must oppose censorship of any kind. It contradicts my personal 
beliefs and betrays the principles upon which our free society is built. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any hint of biased selection of materials or censorship in the development of 
a test is intolerable," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Wilson distanced himself from his own appointees on the Board of 
Education, he did not specifically criticize their actions, taken last year. In 
an interview, he blamed the confusion over his position on a statement by a 
staff member made "in my absence and without my knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 By sending the letters, Wilson also appears to be attempting to quiet 
complaints from state legislators, especially Democrats, who will hold a 
hearing on the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor acted just a day after the first results of the revolutionary new 
testing system were released and showed the state's students in an unflattering 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, who lives in Northern California, was on vacation Wednesday and 
unavailable for comment, according to her agent's office. But earlier, she had 
labeled state educators "abominably weak" for pulling her short story 
"Roselily" from the exam for sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 The censorship fight revolves around two separate incidents, both involving 
stories by Walker, whose work focuses on themes of racism, sexism, oppression 
and callousness. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the Riverside Press-Enterprise published an excerpt from 
"Roselily," which was on last year's test, along with the test questions. The 
excerpt is about the thoughts of an unmarried mother as she stands at the altar 
for her wedding. It appeared in Walker's collection of short stories "In Love & 
Trouble: Stories of Black Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Lange, a spokeswoman for schools chief Dawson, said the story was 
removed from the test because publication in the newspaper violated the 
confidentiality of the exam and because of ensuing protests from conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, shortly after the newspaper story appeared, conservative Christians 
complained to the state Board of Education. Last month, Steve Sheldon of the 
Traditional Values Coalition, whose group complained, said the story "could 
easily be construed as anti-religious and anti-clergy." 
</P>
<P>
 But just as the controversy over "Roselily" quieted down, the Board of 
Education yanked another Walker story, "Am I Blue?" and a passage from 
"American Childhood," by Annie Dillard, from the 1994 test. 
</P>
<P>
 Under authority given by the Legislature, the board was directed to review the 
test. After a review by a subcommittee including McDowell and Kathryn M. 
Dronenburg, along with parents and teachers, the board in December recommended 
that the Walker and Dillard passages be eliminated or modified. To keep the 
test confidential, the full board was never told the names of the stories or 
the authors, according to Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes of the board's December meeting quote McDowell as saying: "It was the 
board's feeling that these two passages might unnecessarily spark controversy. 
One because it might be viewed as violent, the other because it might be viewed 
as advocating a particular nutritional lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell, a school administrator in Redwood City, could not be reached for 
comment. But earlier this month she told the San Francisco Chronicle that "Am I 
Blue?" -- an essay on the life of a horse named Blue -- was "anti meat-eating." 
</P>
<P>
 Dronenburg, who was unavailable Wednesday, was quoted as saying said she 
rejected the Dillard story because of "violence" in a description of a snowball 
fight. "American Childhood" is the story of Dillard's girlhood and adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decisions have been questioned by writers' groups, legislators and 
People for the American Way, a liberal group that battles censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to McDowell and Dawson, Wilson noted that the board is holding a 
hearing on the new statewide test Friday and cautioned that "they need to 
provide public assurance that your procedures . . . are free from the fact or 
appearance of censorship." 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether Walker will be satisfied by Wilson's letter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Walker sent Gov. Wilson a one-sentence note saying she could not 
accept the "Governor's Award for Literature" to be bestowed on her later this 
month. The awards ceremony is a benefit for the California State Summer School 
for the Arts. Walker was designated as an award recipient along with filmmaker 
Steven Spielberg, artist David Hockney, actor Hal Holbrook and others. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's letter to Walker, Wilson noted that the awards are designed to 
raise money for scholarships so needy young people can attend the school and 
urged her to reconsider her decision to turn down the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be particularly ironic if aspiring young artists were deprived of 
the scholarships funded through this dinner over this unfortunate 
misunderstanding," Wilson told Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub contributed to this story.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: VOTERS MAY BE GIVING WILSON ANOTHER LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's something about this gubernatorial contest that doesn't make sense. 
Based on common logic, Gov. Pete Wilson should be dead meat. Yet, many pros are 
rating him an even bet for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 It defies wisdom accrued from the ages. 
</P>
<P>
 And it probably says less about the Republican governor than it does the 
appeal of his two principal Democratic challengers, Treasurer Kathleen Brown 
and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 The most devastating sign for Wilson is that Californians, as a lot, are 
discouraged, disappointed and frustrated over all the state's familiar maladies 
-- the economy, crime, schools, congestion, natural disasters, a deteriorating 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollster Mark Mellman recently asked likely voters the barometer question: "Do 
you feel things in California are going in the right direction, or do you feel 
things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track?" Only 21% answered 
"right direction;" 66% said "wrong track." 
</P>
<P>
 There is ample evidence to corroborate this voter malaise. The Field Poll 
recently found that only 41% of Californians consider their state to be "one of 
the best places to live," down from 51% in 1991 -- when Wilson took office -- 
and 78% in 1985. One-third said they would move to another state if they could. 
</P>
<P>
 When voters are in such despair, they usually kick out the highest-ranking 
officeholder -- a George Bush, a Jimmy Carter or a Pat Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another bad sign for Wilson is more personal: People don't particularly like 
him. The governor's job rating was boosted by his high profile response to the 
Northridge earthquake, but it's still very low for a first-termer seeking 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 A post-quake poll by Field found that the governor's job rating remained 
negative: 30% good, 34% poor. These are the marks of a loser. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown or Garamendi should be running away with this thing. But Wilson is 
closing ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A pre-quake Field Poll had Wilson trailing Brown by only eight percentage 
points, compared with 17 points in October and 23 last May. And the race now is 
even tighter, based on more recent surveys by the Wilson and Brown camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is within five points of Brown, according to the governor's pollster. 
Brown's pollster won't disclose her numbers, but acknowledges that the 
Democratic front-runner is down to a mid-range, single-digit lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has been running slightly better against Wilson than has Brown, but 
his prospects of winning the nomination seem dim. His campaign has little money 
-- hers is loaded -- and Brown has a significant gender advantage within the 
Democratic electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, the health care issue Garamendi had counted on -- because he can 
claim some co-authorship of President Clinton's plan -- isn't jelling for him. 
There also isn't a lot for him to brag about concerning auto insurance rebates 
from Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's looking like a Brown-Wilson race in the fall. And neither candidate is 
getting a big cheer from the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's campaign just isn't clicking. She has multi-point plans for public 
policy, but her message seems scattered and unfocused. It's as if she were 
painting her image by the numbers -- be nice to this party constituency here 
while appeasing these voter concerns there. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Garamendi advisers have been saying Brown's "too nice" in a year 
when voters want "tough." That's political spin, but she does need to work on 
her indignation. She needs to convince others she wants to be governor for 
reasons other than just inheriting the family business. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had planned to hire a new chief strategist: Bill Carrick, Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein's top political adviser. She had a handshake and a contract ready to 
sign. But Feinstein blocked the move after getting nervous about her own race. 
Now, Carrick is an unpaid member of Brown's strategy team, along with Los 
Angeles attorney Bill Wardlaw, a key adviser in Mayor Richard Riordan's race 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wilson has been camped in Los Angeles in front of the television 
camera -- any camera -- talking incessantly about the voters' main concerns: 
Crime and jobs. He is a candidate focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes" will cost too much, you say. He says, "What price do you put 
upon preventing the rape of your wife or daughter, upon preventing the 
molestation of your grandchild?" 
</P>
<P>
 As for the voter malaise, the Wilson camp has a poll showing that most voters 
believe the governor has "done the best he could with a bad situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had a good year as governor in 1993 after a disastrous 1992. Now he's 
into the campaign and voters not only are looking at him, but the alternatives. 
And apparently they're not that impressed.

EXEMPTION FOR CAMPER SHELLS PROVES DEADLY; SAFETY: LAW ALLOWS PEOPLE TO RIDE IN 
AN ENCLOSURE WITHOUT A SEAT BELT OR OTHER RESTRAINT. GOV. WILSON SAYS THE THEY 
OFFER PROTECTION IN SOME ACCIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although a new state law went into effect this year barring pickup truck 
passengers from riding without seat belts in the bed of the vehicles, an 
exemption for trucks with camper shells has allowed accidents involving pickups 
to remain nearly as dangerous as ever, law enforcement officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Such camper shells routinely snap off in accidents, often hurling their 
victims to their deaths, the officials said. Nationwide, one-sixth of all 1992 
pickup bed fatalities involved people thrown from truck beds covered by a 
camper shell. 
</P>
<P>
 The new California law excluded vehicles with camper shells because of 
objections from Gov. Pete Wilson, who has maintained that shells offer adequate 
protection in most accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 How much protection seat belts would have provided in Wednesday's Barstow-area 
crash was unclear because of the nature of the accident. A pickup truck packed 
with 20 people -- 16 of them jammed in a covered truck bed -- crashed on 
Interstate 15, killing 12. Nine of the passengers who died were in the back of 
the truck.

 "When (passengers) hit the camper shell during an accident, it doesn't hold. 
We see time and time again that a person's body weight is enough to push the 
shell right off the truck," said Greg Manuel, commander of public affairs for 
the California Highway Patrol. A camper shell, he adds "does not provide any 
additional protection. It is just like riding unprotected." 
</P>
<P>
 As a CHP officer, Manuel said, he routinely handled cases in which a person in 
the back of a pickup truck was ejected during an accident -- camper shell and 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, which went into effect Jan. 1, prohibits people from riding in 
the open bed of a pickup truck without a federally approved restraint or seat 
belt, Manuel said. Such equipment has yet to be approved, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Californians could ride in the back of open bed trucks without any 
restraint or seat belt; children under 12 could do the same as long as they 
were accompanied by an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was approved as legislators took note of the growing toll of pickup 
accidents in the state. In 1993, 55 people died when they were thrown from the 
back of trucks; 38 deaths and 1,755 injuries were registered in the previous 
year. In an incident that drew wide public attention last year, seven friends 
who were riding in the open bed of a pickup were killed when it was struck by 
an alleged drunk driver on the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law has allowed the CHP to write 1,321 citations for people riding in 
open bed trucks so far this year, but it has left them virtually powerless to 
stop people from riding in pickup beds covered by the camper shells, despite 
mounting evidence of the hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 study by an American Academy of Pediatrics' committee concluded after 
analyzing various crashes that "the enclosure of a pickup bed did little to 
reduce the risk of serious injury." The academy advocated that children and 
adults be prohibited from riding in the back of enclosed, as well as open, beds 
of pick up trucks. A UC Irvine study came to similar conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Wilson vetoed a bill by Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood) 
that prohibited riding unrestrained in the back of pickup trucks, including 
those with camper shells. In his veto message, Wilson argued that camper shells 
provided sufficient protection, and that the bill "would have a serious and 
negative impact on those families which depend on the use of a pickup truck for 
either work or basic transportation." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing another veto, Tucker removed the camper shell provision when he 
reintroduced the bill in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson, J.P. Tremblay, who carries one of his two children in 
the enclosed part of pickup, said the governor felt that a camper shell was 
sufficient to ensure the safety of passengers in low-impact accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the majority of accidents," Tremblay said. In cases such as 
Wednesday's accident, in which the overloaded vehicle rolled down a 20-foot 
embankment, different camper shell provisions would not have helped, Tremblay 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tracey St. Julien, Tucker's chief of staff, contended that removal of the 
camper shell restrictions "negated a lot of the effect of the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Only nine states and the District of Columbia place any restrictions on riding 
in the back of pickup trucks, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Many of these 
states place these restrictions only on children. Of the nine states, most have 
no restrictions if the pickup bed is covered by a camper shell, St. Julien 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wednesday's accident may illustrate, illegal immigrants are often victims 
in rural highway accidents. "If this is a smuggling case, it bears out what we 
have known all along: the ruthless nature of smugglers," said Virginia Kice, a 
spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. "We often see 
people crowded into trucks like human sardines." 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent roadblock near El Centro, authorities stopped a smuggler who 
had crammed 20 people into a van meant for eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Transporting people this way is a daily occurrence," said Gloria Hernandez, a 
community worker with the California Rural Legal Assistance Migrant Farmworker 
Project.

STATE REPORT OPTIMISTIC ON ELECTRIC CARS; POLLUTION: DETROIT HAS ASKED THAT 
1998 INTRODUCTION BE DELAYED. BUT AIR QUALITY OFFICIALS SAY TECHNOLOGY IS 
NEARLY READY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Disputing the auto industry's claims that electric cars remain too impractical 
and expensive to mass-produce, the state Air Resources Board on Wednesday 
released an analysis portraying the technology as nearly ready for widespread 
consumer use. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's review concludes that batteries available for electric cars 
already meet the needs of most commuters, and that operation and maintenance of 
the cars is comparable in cost to that of gasoline-powered vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The rosy outlook for exhaust-free automobiles lays the groundwork for a highly 
anticipated decision by the air board this spring. In May, the ARB must review 
whether the technology has advanced enough to meet a state mandate requiring 
the auto industry to begin selling large numbers of the cars in less than four 
years. If the regulation goes into effect, car makers that fail to meet the 
mandates would lose their certification to sell vehicles in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the standard, 2% of vehicles sold each year in California by major 
manufacturers -- an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 cars -- must be emission-free 
beginning in 1998. The volume increases to 5% in 2001 and 10% in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 The zero-emission mandate, set by the ARB in 1990, has come under fire from 
Detroit's Big Three auto companies, which are pressuring the Wilson 
Administration for a delay of two years or more, depending on their success in 
perfecting high-energy batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the auto manufacturers are striving to develop electric car 
prototypes for California -- including General Motors' Impact and Ford's 
Ecostar -- they say the battery technology lags too far behind to guarantee 
consumers cost-efficient and practical cars by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The ARB's draft report gives the auto industry little technical ground for 
delaying the standard. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies, however, still dispute the findings as overly optimistic, given 
the high costs and complexities of beginning production of large numbers of 
cars entirely new from the tires up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of high hopes too. But it's a difference between saying 
something is ready and saying it is just a goal," said John Wallace, director 
of Ford's electric vehicle development program, who also represents a 
consortium of the Big Three manufacturers and the U.S. Energy Department 
working to produce advanced batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The projections you are seeing in this report are absolutely consistent with 
our goals, too," he said. "But I have literally scores of engineers involved . 
. . and all the data piled up doesn't lead me to believe that these projections 
and goals are in any way achieved. A lot of work needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the ARB's report, four currently available battery technologies 
generate enough power to run a car for 80 to 100 miles between recharges, which 
would accommodate the commutes of nearly 85% of Californians. By 1998, a 
battery with twice that range is likely and it will have a lifetime of five to 
eight years, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The review also concluded that operating and maintaining an electric car 
eventually could be cheaper than using a traditional car, even when the cost of 
replacing the expensive, 1,000-pound battery pack is included. "The total 
operating cost of an electric vehicle can be less than the total operating cost 
of a conventional Ford Escort," the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the electricity will be "a little over a penny a mile," compared 
fuel costs of 4 1/2 cents per mile for a traditional car, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the biggest drawback is that the purchase price of 
electric cars initially will be higher than that of gasoline-powered vehicles. 
One consultants group estimates the sticker price at $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The air agency's report, however, portrays that as a temporary start-up 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "This principle holds true for the introduction of any new technology that is 
initially produced in small volumes. . . . Over the long-term, however, 
electric vehicles are expected to cost about the same as conventional 
vehicles," it says. 
</P>
<P>
 Working together, Detroit's Big Three and battery manufacturers recently have 
created several advanced, high-energy battery packs that seem promising, 
including sodium-nickel-chloride batteries and improved versions of 
conventional lead-acid ones. 
</P>
<P>
 But the industry stressed that these are handmade prototypes that cost around 
$100,000 to build, and that manufacturers are far from being able to 
mass-produce them at a reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The ARB report acknowledges that today's costs are high, but says some pilot 
production plants are already in the works that will make the new technologies 
commercially available at a much lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's easy for them to say, but as the engineer responsible for making the 
cost go down, there are a lot of things we have to do," Wallace said. "With 
almost all these technologies we have active programs, and they are intended to 
help solve these problems. . . . But they are taking the goals of these 
technologies and assuming they are a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto industry officials said they plan to present new data to the ARB 
disputing many of the findings, especially concerning the cost and durability 
of the batteries. A workshop is scheduled for March 25 in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's bound to be differences of opinion, but this is the staff's view 
after compiling a vast amount of information from different sources, not just 
from Detroit, but from Japan and Europe and private entrepreneurs," said ARB 
spokesman Bill Sessa. 
</P>
<P>
 The air board must again review the zero-emission mandates in 1996, but this 
year's decision is expected to be the crucial turning point for the auto 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state standards, GM, Ford, Chrysler, Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Toyota 
will be forced to market electric cars first. Most of the European and small 
Japanese manufacturers have until 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 California's unique requirement for emission-free cars is the hallmark of the 
state's program to clean its air, which is the nation's worst. Motor vehicles 
are responsible for at least half -- and perhaps 75% -- of the gases that form 
the Los Angeles Basin's notorious smog. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the ARB staff has made no recommendations as to whether its 
electric car deadlines should remain intact since they must first analyze 
comments received over the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 However, ARB Chairwoman Jacqueline Schafer, appointed to the board by Gov. 
Pete Wilson in November, repeatedly has said the Administration supports the 
clean-car rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is on the right course toward achieving its air quality goal," she 
said, "and the way we have been able to make progress has been through an 
aggressive program of clean cars and clean fuels."

CAMPAIGN E-MAIL; WILSON FIELDS VOTERS' QUESTIONS ON CRIME, EDUCATION VIA 
COMPUTER NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB and DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday took his reelection campaign on the road -- the 
information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in front of a computer at a Silicon Valley manufacturing company, 
Wilson pecked out answers on his keyboard to questions from constituents with 
cyberspace handles like Tecnonut, Annecat, Mermaid and Miz beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange, carried out on a network organized by the San Jose Mercury News, 
started out well enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, this is Gov. Pete Wilson," the governor typed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome Pete!," came the first reply. Others chimed in: "Hello Mr. Wilson." 
"*Applause*". 
</P>
<P>
 Then they got down to business. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is your highest priority, schools or crime?" came the first question. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, showing that the future of politics may well resemble its past, 
waffled. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the two priorities I announced when I was running for governor and 
they are very much related," he tried to say. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson typed "governor" as "gobernor" and had to start over to correct the 
error. The audience, already upset because Wilson kept them waiting for more 
than hour as they were paying by the minute, grew restless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tick tick tick . . . " said "Miz beyond," apparently wondering when Wilson 
would complete his reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "ZZZZZZZZZZZZ" snored Tecnonut and Tropicman. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfazed, Wilson continued: "There can't be learning or teaching in a classroom 
where fear for personal safety preoccupy teachers and students." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in response to a question about the cost of the "three strikes" 
sentencing bill he signed Monday, Wilson showed that he could be just as 
verbose on the computer as he can be in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask what price or value they place on preventing the rape of a wife or 
daughter or the molestation of a grandchild," Wilson wrote, "by the kind of 
dangerous repeat offender whom Three Strikes will keep away from new victims 
rather than continuing to suffer the intolerable revolving door justice -- 
which is not justice if you are one of the victims." 
</P>
<P>
 That answer filled the space of three messages, and as Wilson typed on, new 
questions rolled across the screen. "No interruptions!" came the word from the 
hosts at the Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
 One question Wilson apparently never saw came from state Sen. Tom Hayden of 
Santa Monica, a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Hayden, 
signed on from a Wilshire Boulevard law office, tried to ambush the governor 
with a query on political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi governor, nice day to travel the information highway, isn't it?" Hayden 
typed. "Since we have all this amazing information technology, why raise $20 
million from special interests to buy meaningless 30-second spots? Why not 
limit contributions and spending and rely on free press? Begin the future now." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time all of Hayden's message had appeared on the screen in Santa 
Clara -- in three pieces -- Wilson had completed his experiment and turned away 
from his screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's unsuccessful attempt to sideswipe the governor, and Wilson's lapses, 
were evidence that political networking may still best be done face-to-face. 
Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign press aide, said later that sitting at the 
computer probably is not the most valuable way for an incumbent governor to 
spend his time. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the campaign will distribute press releases and speeches over the 
network and perhaps assign staff members or surrogates to answer questions on 
particular topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the reaction of Wilson's computer audience was any indication, the 
governor should probably stay off the information highway unless he intends to 
take a good, long drive. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson signed off Wednesday after his 15-minute stint, the electronic 
dialogue erupted into a series of quick and unhappy messages. Most complained 
that they felt the event was more of a political gimmick than a sincere effort 
to answer their questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears this was nothing more than a publicity stunt." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it's all crime," complained another. "Whatever the question, the answer 
is crime." 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen," said another participant with the computer name, Llama mama. "The 
Info Superhwy maybe was just a little too fast for him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub reported from Santa Clara, Lesher from Los Angeles.

 Two young Russian guards at a border post in the Kuril Islands fired on their 
fellow soldiers, killing six and wounding three. They said they were angry at 
being brutally hazed by older soldiers, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency 
reported. The two guards also shot at a military helicopter, but the flaming 
aircraft landed safely.

WARY GERMAN TROOPS TAKE LEAVE OF SOMALIA; AFRICA: NATION'S FIRST FORAY ABROAD 
IN HALF A CENTURY SUCCEEDED. BUT VICE ADMIRAL EXPECTS SKEPTICAL RECEPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 From the pier of the gritty port here, Vice Adm. Hans-Rudolf Bohmer watched 
with pride just after dawn Wednesday as 200 of Germany's first combat soldiers 
to be deployed abroad since World War II marched aboard the German navy ship 
Niemburg, bound for home. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as he stood in combat helmet and flak vest in this still-lawless land, 
the commander of the German Naval Fleet was circumspect at the end of a 
mission, controversial and historic. If, indeed, this was a victory for the 
German military after half a century of international isolation, it was, he 
conceded, a bittersweet one. 
</P>
<P>
 True, in the unprecedented U.N. operation to pacify and rebuild this ruined, 
well-armed nation, an effort that has claimed the lives of 67 peacekeepers from 
nine nations in 15 months -- dozens of them brutally slaughtered by a single 
Somali clan -- the worst the Germans suffered in their eight months here was 
rat bites. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bohmer concluded in a ship-side interview that the success of Germany's 
limited mission in Somalia is likely to positively influence the debate in Bonn 
over lifting constitutional provisions that restricted the powerful German 
military to a noncombat role in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think that they will be welcomed like heroes," the admiral 
concluded, as all but a handful of the last German soldiers to leave Somalia 
prepared to sail into the sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 The German public "realizes that this was participation in a military 
operation with a good aim but that not very much was achieved. The skepticism 
is there about the future of Somalia." 
</P>
<P>
 At the U.N. compound here that the Germans, Americans and others are leaving 
behind this month, that skepticism was mixed heavily with concern on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As Germany pulled out its soldiers -- in keeping with moves by other Western 
nations, which took their cue from President Clinton's decision to withdraw all 
U.S. troops from Somalia before the month's end -- senior U.N. military sources 
confirmed that a dozen of the 28 nations that were expected to remain in a 
less-ambitious U.N. peacekeeping operation here now plan to withdraw too. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is urgently appealing for 
more peacekeepers in the Balkans and elsewhere, U.N. officers in Somalia 
indicated that four nations -- Pakistan, India, Egypt and Zimbabwe -- will 
supply about half of the force here. It also could drop far below the 22,000 
troop level that the United Nations had hoped for after most of the Western 
forces are gone by April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a very comfortable feeling," said Brig. Gen. Saulat Abbas, commander 
of the 5,500-member Pakistani contingent -- the largest single force that will 
remain after the Americans and Europeans depart. "Every soldier who leaves, it 
is not very good for us. I'm just hopeful that things will not deteriorate that 
badly." 
</P>
<P>
 But already the West's exit from Somalia has been met with a sharp increase in 
banditry, armed attacks and firefights on Mogadishu's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the U.N. Security Council has reduced not only the size of the 
Somali operation but its mandate as well. Remaining troops have shifted from 
peacemaking to peacekeeping, and, ever since, armed Somali gangs have been 
roaming freely in increasing number, sometimes taunting U.N. soldiers who are 
under new orders to use force only in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the deepening chaos, none of the departing forces are taking chances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians, who are scheduled to pull the last of their 1,500 troops out of 
their embassy stronghold in north Mogadishu today, mobilized eight armored 
personnel carriers armed with heavy weapons as escorts. They plan to move out 
to Mogadishu's airport in force just after sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the departing forces have been as cautious as the Germans. They 
designed their Wednesday departure to be swifter and safer than even the United 
States' high-security naval withdrawal from this land. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the 200 departing German army troops were on the pier for more than a 
few minutes; they left at an hour before most Somalis are awake. The two German 
ships, which ferried soldiers to flights home from the Kenyan port city of 
Mombassa, remained in Mogadishu harbor for less than 20 minutes each. And, as 
during American departures, small tanks, armored cars and sharpshooters flanked 
the German vessels during boarding. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the deep sensitivities back home toward the least casualty here, 
Bohmer said halfway through the German withdrawal that "w are grateful that 
nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the last soldiers boarded, the commander of the German contingent -- 
which numbered 1,300 at its peak -- exulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good feeling because it's only a short time now to report that the 
mission is completed," said army Col. Holger Kammerhoff, who after an 
eight-month tour here will soon be back at his usual post as commander of 
Germany's 23rd Mountain Brigade. "But it was well done. It was a good job. We 
did it without casualties, and this is important for the debate back home." 
</P>
<P>
 The only casualty during the Germans' tour of duty in the northern town of 
Belet Huen -- a largely peaceful spot, deliberately selected for deployment of 
the only U.N. contingent that was constitutionally barred from combat 
operations -- was a young Somali. 
</P>
<P>
 He was shot by German sentries on Jan. 21 after he and another Somali cut 
through fences around the German camp. The two had refused to heed warning 
shots. Military lawyers said the shooting was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the incident fueled brief yet intense criticism back home of Germany's 
expanding role in U.N. military operations abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 In their time in Belet Huen, the Germans built 11 schools. They dug seven deep 
wells. They put up a clinic, trained doctors and nurses and treated 8,000 
patients through a mobile ambulance service. They constructed three dams -- one 
500 yards long -- that changed the direction of a river so it will irrigate 
12,000 desert acres. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the Germans left Belet Huen, 40 Somalis have died from cholera in a 
nationwide outbreak of the disease. The elders in Belet Huen had rejected the 
Germans' offer to rebuild their sewer system. With the rainy season just days 
away -- a time when the town is routinely submerged -- most of the Germans fear 
that the cholera outbreak will soon become an epidemic in Belet Huen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, lawlessness has spread there since the Germans left. Grenades thrown 
into the compound of a Los Angeles-based relief organization, the International 
Medical Corps, forced the evacuation of all foreign aid workers last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Several U.N. officials said they fear that the town may be on the brink of 
renewed clan warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we came, there was fighting. After we left, there is fighting," said 
German Lt. Col. Harald Rettelbach, the contingent's chief press officer. "The 
things we built, I hope they will remain. But it is like big waves threatening 
a house on shore. We can break the waves at sea, but we cannot stop the high 
water that will come ashore." 
</P>
<P>
 With such reality in mind, the admiral paused and reflected when asked whether 
an exercise that, for Germany, was as political as it was military was more of 
a success for his country than for any of the others that have participated in 
the U.N. operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not say that for Germany this has been a success and for the others 
it was not," Bohmer replied. "We are an integral part of the whole action. In 
the end, I think everyone is sad that it is still such an unstable place."

CLINTON LAUDS U.S. ROLE IN SOMALIA, URGES LEADERS TO KEEP ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 With the last U.S. troops packing up to leave Somalia in the next few days, 
President Clinton on Wednesday said that the United States did more than could 
be expected there, even if competing warlords soon plunge the country back into 
starvation and chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to reporters at the White House, Clinton said Somalia is now the 
responsibility of factional leaders whose disputes produced a man-made famine 
two years ago. He urged them to be more responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The responsibility is shifting back to the leaders there on the ground, and 
they ought to work it out," Clinton said. "They ought to prefer the life their 
people have had the last . . . 15 months to what they had before." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Pentagon has made the U.S. withdrawal as gradual as possible, 
Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the 
departure of the Americans could have an adverse impact. He said there has 
already been a surge of banditry. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, both Clinton and Shalikashvili said Americans should be proud of 
the results of the humanitarian operation to alleviate starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of what it would be if we, the United States and the U.N., had not 
gotten involved," Shalikashvili said. "Thousands upon thousands are alive 
today" because of the outside intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 The President observed: "The American people have been very generous with 
their money and with their support. We have lost some of our most precious 
resources -- (the lives of) our young people -- in Somalia because of the 
nature of the conflict. And I think we have done our job there and then some." 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasizing his policy of avoiding most U.S. military involvement abroad, 
Clinton said the United States cannot be expected to intervene indefinitely in 
what is essentially a civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are civil wars in a lot of countries in this world (where) we have not 
made anything like the effort we've made in Somalia," he said. "There's a civil 
war in Sudan. There's a civil war in Angola. There were lots of people killed 
in Burundi." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged that Somalia's humanitarian crisis cannot be overcome if 
the country's political situation is not addressed. He suggested that former 
President George Bush, who initiated U.S. involvement, may not have realized 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go back to 1992, this whole mission was billed as a humanitarian 
mission, and the first time President Bush spoke with me about it, he said he 
thought maybe they would be out before I was inaugurated or by the end of 
January. And what we learned from that, of course, is that -- at least in the 
case of Somalia and many other cases -- you can't have a humanitarian mission 
divorced from the political problems of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Somalia were starving not because there was no food that could 
be given to them. They were starving because of the political and military 
conflicts consuming the country," he said.

 A weekend massacre of more than 200 Hutu men, women and children reignited 
tribal fighting in Burundi and brought reprisal slayings of scores of ethnic 
Tutsis, the government and diplomats said. A government official put the 
heaviest toll in the capital's Kamenge and Kanima districts.

 Four mortar shells were fired toward Heathrow Airport from a car after 
warnings were telephoned in the name of the Irish Republican Army, but police 
said none of the shells exploded. A scheduled Concorde flight from New York 
touched down on the targeted runway 17 minutes before the attack, officials 
confirmed.

PUBLIC DISCONTENT FOR LAWMAKERS HITS NEW HIGH; DRASTIC REFORMS GAIN FAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a year after their votes swept a new President and more than 100 new 
members of Congress into office, Americans seem more fed up with politicians 
than ever, and their sour mood is giving a boost to efforts to overhaul the 
machinery of government. 
</P>
<P>
 The public's discontent is bolstering support for two drastic governmental 
changes: a campaign to limit the number of terms that elected officials may 
serve and the drive for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal 
budget, whose backers have vowed to fight on despite the Senate's recent defeat 
of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton White House's clumsiness in handling conflict-of-interest charges 
stemming from the Whitewater affair seems to hold the potential for 
intensifying the public's sense of frustration and alienation. 
</P>
<P>
 A Time magazine/CNN survey taken in January showed only 40% of those 
interviewed said they thought of President Clinton as "a leader you can trust," 
while 56% said they had "doubts and reservations." 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of rebelliousness: A survey released last month by GOP pollster 
Tony Fabrizio gave Ross Perot 20% of the vote in a three-way matchup for the 
White House with Clinton and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole. That's about 
the same share the Texas billionaire's insurgent candidacy gained in the 1992 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic pollster Mark Mellman linked voter disenchantment to a record high 
level of mistrust of government. A recent Gallup Poll showed that only 20% of 
respondents said they believe that they can trust the federal government all or 
some of the time -- little more than half the percentage during the Watergate 
scandal in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 What sets this public distemper apart from most such periods in the past is 
that the nation is now at peace, with its economy moving ahead. The causes of 
the current mood seem more complex and more deeply rooted, reflecting a 
fundamental dissatisfaction with the institutions of government that dates to 
Watergate and the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Carll Ladd, director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion, likens 
the current climate to the progressive period of the early 1900s, which spawned 
a range of reforms -- including antitrust legislation and replacement of the 
spoils system with a civil service -- aimed at curbing big business excesses 
and government corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then and now there was a sense of failure of representative institutions," 
Ladd said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some political scientists fear that the balanced-budget and term-limit 
remedies could cause more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 "They limit the choices that people can make in elections and the choices 
their elected representative can make," said Johns Hopkins University political 
scientist Benjamin Ginsberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling figures indicate that the changes wrought by the 1992 presidential 
election have done little to alter the public's negativism. Although Democrats 
control both the White House and Congress, 62% of those interviewed in a Harris 
Poll last month said they believe that legislative gridlock persists. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's approval ratings have improved in recent months, but Ladd notes that 
the President's overall score for his first 13 months in office is the lowest 
of a chief executive (except Gerald R. Ford) for the same period since regular 
presidential polling began -- when Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the problem, says UCLA political scientist John Petrocik, are 
clashing public attitudes -- increasing demands for government to solve 
problems, combined with sharp disagreement over which problems should be 
tackled first and skepticism about government's ability to solve any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Palmer, California director of United We Stand, America, the political 
group founded by Perot, says the wellspring of public discontent is chronic 
government overspending. "People are concerned that the government lacks 
integrity, that it lives by (different) rules," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Senate's rejection of the balanced-budget amendment, some 
backers are trying to get 34 states to call for a constitutional convention to 
draft such an amendment. Lewis K. Uhler, head of the National Tax Limitation 
Committee, says 29 states have already adopted the necessary legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of term-limit proposals argue that the way to restore public 
confidence is to break the power of long-entrenched incumbents and curb the 
influence of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of term limits are preparing to appeal a federal court ruling last 
month that a Washington state term law is unconstitutional. They are striving 
to get congressional term-limit initiatives on the ballot in seven more states 
this fall. Fifteen states, including California, have already adopted term 
limits on federal offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Democrats denounce the term-limit movement as part of a Republican plot 
to reverse long-term Democratic control of Congress. Advocates point to 
adoption of term limits in a number of traditional Democratic strongholds, most 
notably New York City.

PERRY EARNS HIGH MARKS IN NEW JOB; HE'S ERASING VESTIGES OF ASPIN'S REIGN AND 
IS SUCCEEDING IN PUBLIC POLICY ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In just four weeks, the nation's new defense secretary, 66-year-old William J. 
Perry, has begun making significant changes in both the style and the structure 
of the Pentagon's operations, earning early high marks within the Defense 
Department and outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most visible change has been Perry's rapid dismantling of the 
awkward -- and highly controversial -- "little State Department" created in the 
Pentagon by his predecessor, Les Aspin, to handle peacekeeping, human rights 
and other post-Cold War challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that the Aspin-backed think tank had become a political liability, 
Perry downgraded the idea shop to a far less-influential role. And he has 
scrapped two assistant secretary jobs in that area, shifting them to more 
traditional Pentagon offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders say he is restoring a sense of direction to the secretary's office, 
in part by making decisions more promptly and clearly than was Aspin's wont. 
And his workdays and trips abroad are a model of punctuality and order. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real surprise has been in Perry's seeming success so far in the public 
policy part of the job. Despite critics' suggestions that he was too much a 
technocrat, for such a role, he has proved a serious player in top 
policy-making circles -- and an articulate policy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 When the White House was pondering whether to launch air strikes in Bosnia 
last month, for example, it was Perry who insisted on limiting any NATO threat 
to what was achievable militarily, dampening enthusiasm by White House staffers 
for taking on a more ambitious role. 
</P>
<P>
 And just before the Feb. 20 NATO deadline for withdrawal of Serb artillery 
from the Sarajevo area, he called allied defense ministers to a meeting in 
Italy to make sure their governments were still prepared to enforce the threat 
if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Pozen, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology geopolitical analyst, 
says the fact that Perry was able to make the Pentagon's voice heard in the 
Administration's deliberations on NATO's action in Bosnia represents a marked 
contrast from previous days. 
</P>
<P>
 Pozen says one of the problems with the Administration's policy-making during 
Aspin's tenure was that the former Wisconsin congressman was not able to bring 
the Defense Department's reservations to the table forcefully enough. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Perry is demonstrating an ability to field complex foreign 
policy questions at hearings and to provide lawmakers with concise answers that 
appear to reassure them, even when they disagree with a policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a breath of fresh air," one key Congress-watcher said after a meeting of 
the House Armed Services Committee last month. "He knows what he's talking 
about and he's not afraid to answer straight-out." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Perry's performance as an Administration spokesman has had its flaws. 
Visibly nervous during sessions with reporters, Perry spent the better part of 
a nationwide TV interview show looking "like a deer in the headlights," one 
outside critic complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Pervading Perry's first weeks has been the inevitable contrast with Aspin, who 
was viewed as disorganized and inarticulate -- factors that White House 
officials say led to his forced resignation last December in the midst of 
mounting criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new secretary has conspicuously avoided public comparisons with 
Aspin, he clearly has taken pains to avoid repeating Aspin's mistakes. He is 
careful about framing answers to questions, taking time, if need be, to think 
out what he is about to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Perry's initial success in the job, some onlookers question whether he 
can go a needed step further and become a dominant enough force in top 
policy-making circles to put the Administration's overall foreign policy in 
order.

U.S. ESTIMATE OF BOSNIA ROLE CALLED LOW; MILITARY: JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF 
CHAIRMAN PUTS NUMBER OF AMERICAN TROOPS NEEDED FOR PEACE EFFORT AT 50,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday that the number of 
U.S. ground troops needed to enforce any peace accord in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
would be greater than the Clinton Administration is estimating. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili warned against understating the number for 
political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes that the enforcement effort would take about 50,000 troops 
rather than the 15,000 to 45,000 the Administration estimates. And, he said, 
the United States would have to provide half that total, not merely a third, as 
U.S. diplomats have been saying. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments marked the first time that he has publicly taken issue with the 
Administration since taking office in October. They highlighted growing 
differences between the White House and the military on the most sensitive 
issue in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate reaction from the White House or State Department to 
the general's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration floated the 50,000-troop estimate a year ago in earlier 
peace negotiations but has reduced the figure recently in an effort to blunt 
critics' assertions that participation in peacekeeping would require a massive 
commitment of U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff has been telling U.S. allies that fewer 
troops might be required if the three warring factions signed a peace accord 
voluntarily and that Washington would be willing to supply no more than 
one-third of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said at a news conference last month that "all we ever said 
about" U.S. participation in the peacekeeping effort "was that we would expect 
to have less than half. We never specified a specific amount." 
</P>
<P>
 But Shalikashvili told reporters Wednesday that the estimates of a year ago 
are still valid and warned "we must guard against sending less because we think 
that's politically more salable." 
</P>
<P>
 He also threw cold water on suggestions by some top Administration 
policy-makers that the allies should expand the threat of air strikes by the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization to bring peace to other parts of Bosnia, 
such as Tuzla and Srebrenica. The threatened air strikes helped break the 
Serbian siege of Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Sarajevo was unusually well suited to the use of such threats because 
of military and political factors that do not exist in other Bosnian cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalikashvili also made these points: 
</P>
<P>
 * The peace around Sarajevo is still "very fragile," and U.N. forces there 
must be given more troops to consolidate their gains or the situation "could 
get out of hand quickly." But he said that the United States should not send 
ground troops until there is a peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 * The military is trying to influence the negotiations for a peace agreement 
to avoid saddling peace enforcers with unrealistic restrictions -- such as a 
provision in an earlier version of a peace accord that required approval by all 
sides just to move troops. 
</P>
<P>
 * NATO is prepared to send ground troops to help enforce a Bosnian peace 
accord within days after an agreement is signed. The bulk of any U.S. troops 
involved would come from American units stationed in Europe, with only a few 
specialized units flown from the United States. "We are very confident that the 
military part can be put into place quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The most important objective facing allied forces in Bosnia is "that we do 
not lose the balance between keeping the momentum going and overreaching." 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that the allies must also ensure that "we're not too timid and 
lose momentum."

GERMAN COURTROOM BLOOD BATH LEAVES 7 DEAD, INCLUDING ASSAILANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man fined for battering his girlfriend opened fire with a pistol and then 
detonated a bomb in a crowded courtroom Wednesday, killing himself and at least 
six others. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead included a judge, two lawyers, the girlfriend and a woman believed to 
be her mother, according to German police. Fifteen people were wounded, two 
critically, in the attack in this town of 50,000 about 15 miles west of Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
 The rampage was one of the bloodiest in memory in Germany, where such killing 
sprees are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the 39-year-old assailant, whose name was not immediately 
released, had stormed from the courtroom after a judge refused to overturn a 
fine imposed on the man last year for beating up his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Cursing the judge and spectators in the courtroom, the assailant returned 
brandishing a pistol and opened fire, Bonn public prosecutor Joerg Pietrusky 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "His girlfriend was heard to say, 'Watch out, he's shooting in all 
directions,' " Pietrusky said. 
</P>
<P>
 One victim may have been shot in the corridor outside the first-floor 
courtroom in the quiet crossroads town between Bonn and the Belgian border. The 
31-year-old judge, who was not identified, reached for a telephone to call 
security when he was shot in the neck, according to witnesses. A bailiff 
reportedly leaped to safety through a window, while other court officials dived 
for cover behind the judge's bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors told German radio that the assailant then reached into a black 
backpack and extracted a bomb. The blast demolished the courtroom, blowing out 
three windows and flinging the defendant's body through a window into an 
adjacent park. 
</P>
<P>
 German television reported that there was little courtroom security, which 
Pietrusky said was typical for a court that handled relatively minor and 
routine criminal cases. Michael Herman, spokesman for the Euskirchen 
prosecutor's office, said, "As far as I know, this is the first time anything 
like this has happened in a German court." 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful explosion blew debris 100 yards down the street and littered the 
sidewalk with glass, brick fragments and several tattered lawbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were trying to piece together the assailant's motives and 
background. Pietrusky said the man had no previous convictions and had not 
issued any threats before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A newscaster for the N-TV network finished his report on the blood bath with 
the comment, "It will soon be like America here."

SERVICEWOMEN TELL PANEL OF SEX HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Navy Lt. Darlene Simmons was at sea a few days on the submarine tender Canopus 
when she started getting suggestive notes from her supervisor, a Navy 
lieutenant commander. 
</P>
<P>
 "He repeatedly commented about my physical appearance, such as, 'That uniform 
does not show your body in a just light,' " Simmons told the House Armed 
Services Committee Wednesday. The notes were only the beginning of an ordeal 
that included Simmons being locked up in a psychiatric ward and ended without a 
sexual harassment conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons and three other women representing each of the military services told 
the committee of unpunished sexual harassment ranging from unwanted kisses to 
verbal abuse during basic training. 
</P>
<P>
 In emotionally charged testimony the women said their complaints met with 
shrugs or outright disdain from their superiors. Their own careers, rather than 
the careers of the alleged harassers, suffered, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began my naval career on a fast track toward advancement," said Simmons, 
who, as a Navy attorney, had investigated harassment complaints. "These events 
have completely derailed my ambitions. Despite the rhetoric, the Navy will not 
tolerate those who report sexual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons said she was told not to talk about the harassment, in order to save 
her supervisor from embarrassment. When she contacted Sen. John B. Breaux 
(D-La.) about her situation, she was ordered to undergo a psychiatric 
examination. She was found fit for duty but kept in a psychiatric unit for 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland), the committee chairman, questioned the 
Defense Department's commitment to eliminating sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the frequent pronouncements by (the Department of Defense) and 
service officials of 'zero tolerance,' sexual harassment continues as a serious 
problem," and Congress may need to "radically restructure" the military 
complaint system, Dellums said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Wednesday, witnesses representing the Defense Department and military 
services outlined detailed policies and awareness programs designed to prevent 
or punish sexual harassment. Assistant Defense Secretary Edwin Dorn called the 
system basically sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commanders in the field still may not say loudly enough or often enough that 
sexual harassment will not be tolerated," Dorn said. "Indeed, some egregious 
cases of sexual harassment have been handled incompetently and insensitively."

KIMBERLY MAYS MOVES IN WITH BIRTH PARENTS; FAMILY: TEEN-AGER SWITCHED AS 
NEWBORN ASKS TO STAY WITH COUPLE SHE TOLD COURT SHE NEVER WANTED TO SEE AGAIN. 
'PERSONAL DIFFICULTIES' CITED.

 Kimberly Mays, the girl who was switched at birth and became the center of one 
of the nation's most celebrated custody fights, has moved in with her 
biological parents -- the same couple she once told a court she never wanted to 
see again. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise move follows weeks of turmoil in the life of the 15-year-old, who 
for the past several days had been living in a Sarasota YMCA shelter for 
troubled teens. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the girl's court-appointed guardian confirmed Wednesday that 
Robert Mays, the only father Kimberly has ever known, approached Ernest and 
Regina Twigg about taking her into their home on a "temporary and informal" 
placement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kimberly Mays has been experiencing certain unique personal difficulties in 
trying to deal with certain teen-age issues that face all teens," said attorney 
David L. Denkin in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. and Mrs. Mays will maintain parental control and open communications with 
Mr. and Mrs. Twigg. . . ," said Denkin. "It is hoped by both families that as a 
result of the two families' communication and joint efforts toward Kim's best 
interests that Kim will pass through this difficult time and once again be able 
to direct her efforts to her education and growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly has moved into the Twiggs' home in Sebring, Fla., and is expected to 
enter high school there immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The move by the slight, blond teen-ager adds another remarkable chapter to a 
wholly improbable saga, and represents a complete turnabout for a girl who last 
August tearfully recounted for a judge and a national audience watching on 
cable TV how she begged Robert Mays, "Please, don't let them take me away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Twiggs, who have seven other children, have been fighting to win parental 
custody and visitation rights since 1988. That year a blood test following the 
death of their daughter Arlena revealed that she could not have been their 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective work along trails of medical records eventually established that 
Arlena and Kimberly had been switched in December, 1978, in a Wauchula, Fla., 
hospital, where both were born three days apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twiggs sued for custody of Kimberly, even suggesting that Robert Mays and 
his late wife may have orchestrated the switch of infants after discovering 
that their daughter had a congenital defect that would eventually kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays denied any role in the switch, and while conceding that Kimberly is not 
his biological child, argued that Kimberly should be free to stay with the 
father she had known from infancy. In a landmark ruling hailed by proponents of 
rights of minors, Circuit Judge Stephen Daken agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence is clear that Robert Mays is her psychological parent and that 
the plaintiffs are seen by her as a constant source of danger to her father and 
to her family relationship," Daken wrote in his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the judge criticized the behavior of the Twiggs, saying their 
earlier efforts to forge a relationship with the girl had "created a chasm . . 
. that may never be bridged." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Mays and Twigg families have become millionaires as a result of the 
infant switch and its emotional aftermath. In September, 1992, Robert and 
Kimberly Mays accepted $6.6 million in a settlement of their suit against the 
hospital. The Twiggs had earlier settled for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Word that Kimberly Mays had left the Sarasota shelter and moved in with the 
Twiggs in Sebring set off a news media free-for-all in the Central Florida town 
of 8,700. Ernest Twigg wrestled briefly with a news photographer Wednesday 
afternoon as other family members screamed at reporters to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a continuing media onslaught, however, the Highlands County 
Sheriff's Department designated as a staging area a field across from the high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that she got gypped out of life like that," Sebring High student 
Shannon Brown told one reporter. "But I'm glad she's coming here."

WHITE HOUSE UNVEILS WELFARE OVERHAUL; POLICY: PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR 
RECIPIENTS TO FIND JOBS. BUT WORK WOULD BE REQUIRED AFTER TWO YEARS OF 
BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Administration officials Wednesday unveiled the outline of a plan to reform 
the nation's welfare system through a delicate balance of new services to 
benefit recipients and tough restrictions to impress wary taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The package would expand training, job placement and government-subsidized 
child care for recipients to make it easier for them to go to work. But, for 
the first time, it also would require work after two years of benefits and make 
it harder for teen-age mothers to collect benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The package puts together elements that the Administration has discussed 
before and adds new detail. But reflecting disputes within the Administration, 
it leaves unresolved several important issues, including how the program will 
be financed and who may be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would limit the program to those born after 1972, the youngest 
third of the 5 million adults on welfare. Welfare recipients in that group who 
are unable to find jobs would not be left without a safety net: They would be 
placed in temporary government-subsidized jobs if they could not find 
employment in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the other two-thirds of recipients would not face those 
requirements, officials stressed that the proposal would fulfill the 
President's campaign pledge to "end welfare as we know it." "No one can read 
our papers and not come away struck by the fact that we really are serious. 
After a period of time, two years, the expectation is that people will go to 
work and that traditional welfare will end," one of the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare experts agreed, saying that phasing in the program may be the only way 
to make it work, both because the assistance for recipients moving off welfare 
would be expensive and because enforcing the time limit would require states to 
make major institutional changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "By phasing it in, they may not go as far as what the President promised, but 
it may be the appropriate way to make sure the systems are in place to enforce 
the time limit," said Demetra Nightengale, a welfare expert at the Urban 
Institute, a Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the proposal is highly uncertain, officials said, because many 
decisions remain that will greatly affect the price tag. Under one possible 
breakdown of the package, the nation's annual welfare bill would grow by $6 
billion in 1999, with total additional costs of $15 billion for the years 1996 
to 1999, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One official said that costs should not go higher than that. Welfare currently 
costs the nation about $22 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare reform was one of the most popular issues of Clinton's 1992 
presidential campaign. Record numbers of Americans now receive Aid to Families 
With Dependent Children and out-of-wedlock births total almost a third of all 
births. Those facts have caused concern among many experts and politicians as 
well as taxpayers, who have decried the fact that the current system seems to 
do little to push welfare recipients off the rolls and does not discourage the 
births of children, even when parents have no means to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 But history shows that grand plans by presidents to overhaul the welfare 
system often founder in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his Administration, Clinton turned the task of designing a plan that 
could win congressional approval over to a 32-member working group of 
sub-Cabinet officials from eight agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, the group has been working on a plan, which was detailed 
in a 45-page document and presented to Cabinet members last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, however, has been unable to reach consensus on several of the most 
difficult policy issues. Some of these will be left for the President to decide 
before a final proposal is presented to Congress this spring, according to 
Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Unresolved issues include: 
</P>
<P>
 * How the reforms should be financed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who among the younger recipients should be exempt from the work requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether government-subsidized child care should be provided to the working 
poor to help them avoid going on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether states would be allowed to cap family benefits so that recipients 
who have additional children would not get added cash benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * How long people can stay in their government-subsidized jobs, and what 
happens to them after that time limit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dispute over the shape of the government-subsidized job program, 
planners agreed that there should be disincentives to staying in these jobs and 
incentives to getting jobs in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Administration officials have argued that people who are willing to 
work but cannot find a job should not receive less than they did on welfare. 
Others favor allowing states to offer part-time work with salaries that do not 
equal the benefit or limit participation in such jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the themes that the President conveyed throughout the campaign was 
that families that play by the rules ought to be rewarded," said Robert 
Greenstein, an expert here on poverty legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to requiring work from welfare recipients, one of the biggest 
goals of the working group was to create a policy that would send "the message 
loud and clear that you should not have a child until you are in a position to 
nurture and provide for that child," one Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, mothers receiving benefits would be required to help 
establish paternity of their children. Also, child support would be more 
stringently enforced and fathers would be provided with job training to help 
them meet their responsibilities.

MOST TYPICAL HEALTH PLANS FOUND TO COVER ABORTION; REFORM: THE STUDY OF PRIVATE 
INSURERS MAY HELP FURTHER EFFORTS TO INCLUDE PROCEDURE IN LEGISLATION. COVERAGE 
IS CALLED KEY PART OF BASIC WOMEN'S CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an almost certain boost for efforts to include routine abortion coverage in 
health care reform, a study released Wednesday found that two-thirds of typical 
health plans cover abortion and about nine of 10 cover sterilization. 
</P>
<P>
 The study of private insurance coverage of reproductive health services, 
conducted by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit reproductive health 
research organization, also showed that many of these same plans do not cover 
contraceptive services, a finding "clearly in line with the traditional bias of 
health insurance against preventive care," said Jeannie I. Rosoff, president of 
the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosoff testified at a hearing of the Senate Labor and Human Resources 
subcommittee on aging on the impact of health reform on women's health care. 
The results of the study were released at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosoff noted that many plans place restrictions on abortion coverage by 
requiring a physician to certify that the abortion is medically necessary. 
Nevertheless, the findings are expected to further attempts to keep abortion 
coverage as a guaranteed benefit in whatever health reform plan emerges from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those who will try to play politics with these issues and argue 
that abortion should not be included in the benefits package," said Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who attended the hearing at the invitation of Sen. 
Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), who chairs the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not talking about providing women with a 'new benefit.' We are not 
talking about providing them with additional coverage," Boxer said. "We are 
talking about offering women the same coverage and benefits that they already 
receive from most private health insurers." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.), who chairs the Congressional Women's Caucus 
abortion rights task force, said the study proves that "abortion coverage is 
currently the norm" and that it is "an integral component of basic women's 
health care." 
</P>
<P>
 But Douglas Johnson, federal legislative director of the National Right to 
Life Committee Inc., said that abortion rights groups are trying to "hijack 
health care reform to dramatically expand abortion services and force all 
Americans to pay the bill through mandatory 'premiums' and other taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Johnson accused the institute of pro-abortion bias and 
emphasized that "whatever private abortion coverage currently exists is the 
result of free decisions in the marketplace by insurers, employers and/or 
consumers of insurance -- not of any federal mandate." 
</P>
<P>
 In other health reform-related activities, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
made her first trip to Capitol Hill in several weeks for an informal lunch with 
a group of Democratic senators. 
</P>
<P>
 Her purpose was to build morale on all sides at a time when the health care 
plan is facing rough going in Congress. She will be making a similar appearance 
before a group of House Democrats today. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on the Hill, the House Ways and Means health subcommittee trudged 
through a second day of its laborious effort to approve its own health bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee, the first in Congress to start work on a health care bill, 
spent the day considering an initial draft offered by its chairman, Rep. Pete 
Stark (D-Oakland). Stark's bill embraces Clinton's goal of universal coverage, 
but achieves it by expanding the Medicare program to cover the uninsured. 
Voting is not expected to begin until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, thousands of tobacco workers and smokers marched past the 
White House to Capitol Hill to protest President Clinton's proposed 
75-cents-a-pack tax hike on cigarettes to help finance his health care package. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guttmacher study, funded by the independent Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation, was based on a 1993 survey of the 100 largest commercial insurance 
companies, all 73 of the nation's Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans and 213 health 
maintenance organizations. More than half of the plans responded, the institute 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that nearly 90% of typical plans routinely cover surgical 
sterilization, and two-thirds routinely cover abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining one-third either do not cover abortion at all or restrict 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the large commercial and Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans do not 
cover any reversible contraceptive method and only 15% cover all five of the 
most effective medical methods, the study said. Only one-third cover oral 
contraceptives, the study said.

 What are investigators looking for concerning the President's earlier 
involvement with a real estate venture known as Whitewater? How serious are the 
charges? As the controversy builds, here is a look at the case: Q & A 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is Whitewater? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The name comes from Whitewater Development Corp., a real estate venture 
Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and their partners, James B. and Susan 
McDougal, formed in the late 1970s to build a vacation community in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What put Whitewater into the news? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Last fall the Resolution Trust Corp., the savings-and-loan cleanup agency, 
referred questions about McDougal's failed S&L to the Justice Department for a 
possible criminal probe. Among the questions were whether funds from McDougal's 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Assn. were illegally diverted to pay the 
personal and political debts of Arkansas politicians and whether funds went to 
Whitewater or to help retire Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign debt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does the Rose Law Firm have to do with Whitewater? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Little Rock law firm is where Mrs. Clinton, Associate Atty. Gen. 
Webster Hubbell and the late White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster worked 
before coming to Washington. Mrs. Clinton and other Rose lawyers represented 
Madison S&L in the mid-1980s. After Madison failed, the government sought 
damages from an accounting firm it blamed in the failure, and it hired the Rose 
firm and Hubbell to handle the suit. Questions have been raised whether that 
constituted a conflict, given Rose's past work for Madison and the fact that 
Hubbell had relatives with extensive financial dealings at the S&L. The 
government recently cleared Rose of conflicts but that decision is being 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did the Whitewater affair expand to the White House? 
</P>
<P>
 A: After Foster's death last summer, which was ruled a suicide, White House 
Counsel Bernard Nussbaum screened Foster's White House papers before allowing 
police investigators access. That and the delay in sealing Foster's White House 
office led critics to question whether documents related to Whitewater and 
Madison might have been removed. Last fall and again in February, top Treasury 
Department officials and regulators briefed White House officials on the status 
of the Whitewater probe, prompting questions about whether the White House was 
trying to meddle in the investigation. Nussbaum resigned Saturday. The Critical 
Questions 
</P>
<P>
 Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr.'s probe will touch on every aspect of the 
case, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Madison's failure and whether any illegal diversions took place that could 
have benefited the Clintons, Whitewater or other prominent Arkansans. 
</P>
<P>
 * The recent contacts between the White House and S&L regulators regarding the 
Madison investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foster's death. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether any improper shredding occurred at the Rose firm. Public Concern 
Grows 
</P>
<P>
 Half the public now believes that Whitewater is a serious matter, an ABC News 
poll found. 03,34,07,06 View of Whitewater March Jan. Serious matter, needs 49% 
33% full-scale federal investigation Not serious, should be dropped 30% 36% Not

525 adults nationwide. Margin of error is plus or minus 5 percentage points. A 
Little Place in the Country 
</P>
<P>
 The small, money-losing real estate venture known as Whitewater was located 
along the White River in the Ozark Mountains. In 1980, seeking to promote the 
Arkansas vacation development, Hillary Rodham Clinton borrowed $30,000 to 
finance this model home. The loan came from a bank owned by her partner, James 
B. McDougal, and the loan payments were made by the Whitewater partnership. The 
three-bedroom, ranch-style home was built on 2.7 wooded acres. The Clintons say 
they lost $68,900 on the entire venture. Key Moments 
</P>
<P>

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON'S SUCCESSFUL LEGISLATIVE TACTICS BACKFIRE IN WHITEWATER; 
PRESIDENCY: EFFORTS TO CONTROL THE DEBATE DO NOT SUCCEED WITH ETHICAL 
QUESTIONS. INSTEAD, THEY INCREASE THE SUSPICION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO 
HIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Republican pressure mounting for congressional hearings on Whitewater, it 
has become increasingly clear that the political skills President Clinton and 
his aides use effectively in campaigns and legislative fights exacerbate their 
difficulties when the battleground is ethics and character. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some Clinton supporters are beginning to think the tactics and habits of 
mind that make the President a difficult target for Republicans on most policy 
issues may be drawing a bull's-eye across his forehead on Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 In case after case, Clinton has triumphed by controlling the terms of debate 
and determining the field of battle. On issues such as crime, immigration and 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, he has repeatedly relied on three 
tactics to achieve that control: He steals the opposition's thunder by blending 
competing arguments. He employs flexibility to shift the point of conflict. And 
he attacks his critics aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 But on ethical challenges, there is no real middle ground to seize and 
shifting ground leads to trouble. So does the aggressiveness that has marked 
Clinton's approach to political combat from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lesson is you don't have control over (ethics questions), so get out of 
the way," Democratic consultant Brian Lunde says. "If you try to control it, 
it's just like you put a hand on a burner -- you'll get burned." 
</P>
<P>
 In legislative and campaign battles, Clinton often moves swiftly to co-opt new 
issues or lines of argument. One example: Despite widespread resistance among 
liberals -- and division within his own Administration -- Clinton swiftly 
endorsed "three-strikes" provisions for violent felons after it became apparent 
that Republicans were trying to center the crime debate on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same White House instincts have been apparent in the Whitewater 
struggle. One reason the White House dropped its opposition to a special 
counsel was the conclusion that the Administration could effectively resist 
calls for public release of Whitewater business records once they had been 
turned over to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Clinton now uses the establishment of the special counsel's office 
he once opposed as an argument against holding congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 But this sort of tactical maneuvering only reinforces suspicion that the 
Administration has something to hide, Lunde says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even less applicable to ethical challenges has been the White House's 
never-give-an-inch attitude toward political struggles. In two distinct 
respects, that approach has backfired in the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 On issues and ethical challenges alike, Clinton and his political aides 
operate on the assumption that no sin is greater than not punching back. From 
the first allegations of marital infidelity in 1992 to the allegations from 
state troopers last December that they helped Clinton to execute and cover up 
extramarital affairs, Clinton's first instinct is to portray charges of 
impropriety as part of a political campaign to weaken him. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Whitewater case, some senior officials acknowledge, the White House 
argument that political opponents are driving the issue, although not entirely 
without basis, has added to the perception that Clinton is reluctant to address 
the underlying issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Political adviser Paul Begala, who has delivered some of the sharpest barbs 
against Clinton's critics, says that "at some times my own political response 
has been wrong and ill-advised." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important, Clinton has long displayed an extremely aggressive 
attitude toward the control of information relating to his personal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many political operatives maintain that the best way to deal with 
questions of integrity is to flood the press and political system with as much 
information as possible, Clinton has typically taken a more combative and 
lawyerly approach -- providing information only when he appeared to have no 
other choice. 
</P>
<P>
 This winter, for example, the White House did not reveal for 12 days that the 
Clintons' personal lawyer had negotiated a subpoena with the Justice Department 
intended to prevent public release of Whitewater-related files. 
</P>
<P>
 It also waited months to acknowledge that recently ousted Counsel Bernard 
Nussbaum had removed files from the office of Vincent Foster, the deputy White 
House counsel who authorities say committed suicide last summer. One senior 
White House official said this week that the decision to take those files, and 
not disclose it, was the critical mistake in fueling the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides commonly blame these decisions on Nussbaum's litigation-bred 
inclination to avoid disclosure unless absolutely necessary. But the courtroom 
instincts that White House colleagues have imputed to Nussbaum were also 
evident in Clinton's handling of campaign controversies over the draft and his 
youthful use of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Clinton made statements that strongly implied he had not 
received an induction notice for the draft in 1969, only acknowledging it when 
newspapers produced evidence of its existence. During the campaign, even some 
of Clinton's closest aides harbored doubts over whether he was sharing with 
them all he knew about the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Clinton originally deflected questions about his youthful use of 
marijuana by insisting that he had never broken the drug laws of this country; 
it was only when he was asked the question in a slightly different way that he 
acknowledged using marijuana while in England on his Rhodes scholarship. The 
result was an impression of a politician more cagey than candid. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Whitewater critics maintain, the President's reluctance to 
disclose information about Whitewater could only mean that the disclosure would 
damage him. "The hits they have taken to cover it up suggest to me that what is 
under the rug is really bad," declared Republican strategist and former 
Education Secretary William J. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials offer a more benign explanation: The Clintons have 
resisted release of information in these controversies because they hold to the 
belief that significant aspects of their life should remain private.

LEACH FORMIDABLE ADVERSARY FOR CLINTON; WHITEWATER: THE GOP LAWMAKER PUSHING 
FOR HEARINGS ON ARKANSAS REAL ESTATE VENTURE HAS A REPUTATION FOR INTEGRITY AND 
INDEPENDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of plaguing the leaders of his own party, maverick Republican Rep. 
Jim Leach is emerging as one of President Clinton's most formidable adversaries 
in the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old Iowa lawmaker demonstrated his resolve this week by pushing 
ahead with plans to turn a planned House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs 
Committee hearing into an inquiry into the Whitewater tangle. He is doing so 
despite special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr.'s contention that congressional 
inquiries could hurt his own investigation into possible criminal violations 
stemming from Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues of government integrity and abuse of power involved in the matter 
are broader than Fiske's prosecutorial concerns, Leach argued in a letter to 
Fiske. Earlier, Leach, the ranking Republican on the committee, predicted in a 
telephone interview that the hearing, tentatively set for March 24, would be of 
"blockbuster proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly, the hearing is an exercise of the committee's responsibility for 
overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency charged with reviving the 
scandal-racked and debt-ridden savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But committee Republicans, spearheaded by Leach, have served notice that they 
intend to use their time to call a broad roster of people connected with 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which is at the heart of the Whitewater 
controversy, as well as officials of the Clinton Administration who have been 
linked to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is looking into allegations that then-Gov. Clinton may have benefited 
improperly from his association with James B. McDougal, owner of Madison 
Guaranty and a Clinton partner in an Ozark real estate firm known as Whitewater 
Development Corp. The inquiry also encompasses the role played by First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Rose Law Firm, of which she was once a partner, 
in representing Whitewater and Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 When he began looking into Whitewater, Leach said, he believed that nothing 
more serious was involved than a violation of ethical standards and "the spirit 
of the law." But now he says: "I am increasingly coming to the conclusion that 
we have an issue that also relates to the letter of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from Leach, with his reputation for high-minded and well-informed 
independence built during 10 terms in the House, such ominous talk is harder 
for the President and his allies to shrug off than if it had emanated from most 
other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason he (Leach) was able to bring this issue to the front is his high 
standard of integrity and his expertise in banking," former Rep. Dave Nagle 
(D-Iowa) said of his onetime colleague. "Even out here in Iowa where Clinton is 
doing well at the polls, people said if Jim Leach is looking at Whitewater, he 
should be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that stuck out about Leach was that he wasn't going to let anybody, 
even the President of his own party, dictate how he was supposed to represent 
his own district," recalled Jim Maddy, executive director of the League of 
Conservation Voters, who remembered Leach's opposition to President Ronald 
Reagan's environmental policies a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddy said Clinton aides are making a mistake when they respond to Leach's 
comments about Whitewater by accusing him of excessive partisanship. "This is a 
person of stature and integrity," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach signaled the independence that would be his hallmark in public life when 
he resigned from the Foreign Service in 1973 in protest of President Richard 
Nixon's firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Congress he caused distress for GOP chief executives and congressional 
leaders by supporting the nuclear freeze, opposing military aid to the Contras 
in Nicaragua and calling for the resignation of then-Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III 
because of the Iran-Contra scandal, in which the Reagan Administration 
converted proceeds from secret arms sales to Iran to fund the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Begala, the Clinton political adviser who has taken on the task of 
hitting back at what he calls Leach's innuendo and "scurrilous rhetoric," 
acknowledged that he has been frustrated by Leach's "Bambi blue eyes and 
soft-spoken Midwesterner manner," as well as his reputation for integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe Leach deserves the good reputation he has," Begala said. "But I 
think he is putting all that reputation on the line for the proposition that 
Bill and Hillary Clinton are crooks." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach's admirers, however, said his concern with Whitewater transcends the 
fate of the Clintons or any partisan concern and is rooted instead in the 
reform tradition nurtured in the Upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives you the impression of someone who is concerned about the governing 
process and the ability of this country to survive," said Clark Pellett, 
another Iowa native and now a Republican ward committeeman in Chicago, after 
hearing Leach speak on Whitewater at a GOP dinner in the Windy City last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pellett said Leach's 20-minute talk was "very intellectual and scholarly." 
During the question period, when asked about Clinton's own involvement in the 
affair, Pellett recalled, "he said he had to be very clear there isn't any 
allegation whatsoever against the President or the First Lady that has been 
substantiated." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach himself contends that his current absorption with Whitewater stems 
naturally from his longstanding concern about the savings and loan industry. He 
sounded the alarm early and often against the debacle that overtook the 
industry in the late 1980s.

CLINTON UNVEILS $13-BILLION JOB TRAINING, COUNSELING BILL; ECONOMY: PROPOSAL IS 
AIMED AT GETTING THE UNEMPLOYED BACK TO WORK FASTER. HE CALLS PLAN KEY TO 
RAISING LIVING STANDARDS OF LOWER-INCOME AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich on Wednesday unveiled a 
five-year, $13-billion job training and assistance bill designed to help 
unemployed people get back to work faster -- the fourth major element of the 
Administration's domestic policy agenda for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The existing system of unemployment and training is simply broken," Clinton 
declared in an East Room ceremony called to launch the bill. The 
Administration's bill, he said, is designed to repair one that is "outmoded, 
bureaucratic and too often delays people getting back to work instead of 
accelerating their return to the work force. It will build a new system to help 
workers get the training and counseling they need to fill higher-wage jobs more 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reich first sold Clinton on the idea of the bill -- which he has 
dubbed the "re-employment act" -- at a time of high unemployment, the proposal 
remains a high priority for the Administration even though unemployment rates 
have dropped. The legislation's prospects in Congress, however, are believed to 
be questionable this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has argued in private to his aides that the proposal is key to raising 
the living standards of lower-income Americans and to reducing the fear of 
long-term unemployment. He has cited the re-employment proposal -- along with 
health care reform, welfare reform and anti-crime efforts -- as the main items 
on his agenda for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's bill is aimed at the 1.8 million to 2 million people who 
get laid off each year with little chance of getting their old jobs back. To 
assist those workers, the bill would consolidate six existing job training 
programs -- the largest of which, the Trade Adjustment Act, is designed to help 
workers who are injured by import competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In place of the existing programs, the Administration would create a single, 
new program that would provide intensive counseling and help in looking for a 
new job. Current programs assist only about 570,000 dislocated workers each 
year with the level of assistance varying widely. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's proposal also would provide grants to states to establish "one-stop" 
employment centers that consolidate existing programs to help unemployed 
workers. States would be required to begin screening all unemployed workers to 
determine, within the first five weeks of unemployment, which people have a 
reasonable chance of getting back their old jobs and which ones will need more 
intensive help finding a new line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed bill also would authorize states to conduct experiments with 
several innovative programs designed to get people off unemployment rolls more 
quickly. A small percentage of unemployed workers would be eligible to cash in 
their unemployment benefits as a lump sum bonus in return for getting a new job 
early on. Another small group of people would be eligible to receive grants to 
start their own businesses in lieu of receiving regular unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of budget constraints, the Administration drastically scaled back 
Reich's initial ideas that would, essentially, have given every American worker 
an entitlement to federally supported job training. Instead, the bill would 
phase-in slowly -- becoming fully effective only at the end of the decade and, 
even then, would only provide job training to a fraction of those who are 
permanently out of a job. Most displaced workers would receive only assistance 
in finding a new job -- computer searches of job listings, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the bill would roughly double the number of people enrolled in some 
form of federally assisted job training from 250,000 now to about 500,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 To fund the new proposal, the Administration would consolidate the six 
existing Department of Labor training programs and cut additional domestic 
spending. Clinton's budget for fiscal 1995 already identified some $1.5 billion 
in cuts to fund the first year of the program but the Administration would have 
to find -- and persuade Congress to approve -- several hundred million dollars 
more in program cuts to offset higher spending in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The most expensive part of the new program would be federal income-support 
payments to those people who need long-term training. To save money, long-term 
training -- up to 18 months beyond a person's regular, 26-week, entitlement to 
unemployment compensation -- would be sharply restricted. Funds for income 
supplements would come primarily from making permanent a "temporary" 0.2% 
federal unemployment tax first enacted in 1977. That tax generates about $1.2 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials estimated that about 225,000 workers a year would be 
eligible for long-term training and income support. 
</P>
<P>
 Several aspects of the proposal have drawn fire from groups ranging from 
business, which is unhappy about extending the 0.2% payroll tax, to labor, 
which is worried that workers eligible for existing programs would end up 
getting less under the new bill than they get now. Some representatives of 
business groups also have worried that the program might evolve from its 
current, limited form into a more expensive entitlement program.

2 DRUGS MAY SERVE AS BACKUPS FOR AZT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AIDS patients for whom the drug AZT no longer offers help in fighting the 
deadly infection can choose either of two backup drugs for continued help, 
according to a UC San Francisco study. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither of the two drugs is as effective as the early treatments with AZT, 
which decline in effectiveness over time. 
</P>
<P>
 The test on 467 people with AIDS for whom the drug AZT had lost its 
effectiveness found that two other drugs offer the same help in fighting 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The drugs tested were didanosine (DDI) and zalcitabine (DDC), both of which 
have been made available by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under a 
program to accelerate experimental AIDS drugs onto the market. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative to AZT is needed because its benefits sometimes fade in two to 
three years for people with no symptoms, and within 12 to 18 months when the 
number of infection-fighting cells has dropped significantly.

SCIENCE / GEOLOGY; STUDY SAYS PAUSE MIGHT SIGNAL VOLCANIC ERUPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Arizona State University geologist who was seriously injured last year when 
Galeras Volcano in Colombia unexpectedly erupted while he and other scientists 
were studying it, reports today that Galeras and certain other volcanoes may 
give off a signal before erupting. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, according to geologist Stanley N. Williams and five other researchers 
writing in the British journal Nature, it may be possible to predict some 
eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 And had they possessed the information last year, Williams, 41, and the 
research party he was part of would certainly have stayed away from the crater 
on Jan. 14, 1993, when nine people were killed in the eruption, including six 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists say the signal actually was a pause in sulfur dioxide emissions 
and long-period, or harmonic, seismicity. What they thought at the time was 
reassuring quiet was, in fact, an ominous calm before an immediate explosion, 
they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams led the 15-member American contingent of a team of 100 scientists 
from 15 countries who were on a United Nations mission to explore protection of 
cities such as Pasto from volcanic hazards. Pasto is a city of 300,000 that 
lies just five miles below the dangerous mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the scientists were at the bottom of the inner crater when the 
eruption occurred. But Williams, who had been making his way off a slope of the 
cone leading down from the crater rim, escaped with a fractured skull, nose and 
jaw, and broken legs after being hit by eruptive debris. 
</P>
<P>
 His recovery has lasted more than a year. On Tuesday, Williams underwent 
surgery on one leg, which had been shattered. He is expected to regain full use 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he and six other scientists who were at Galeras -- from Arizona State, the 
University of Montreal and the Pasto Volcanic Observatory, believe they have 
unlocked secrets about the events leading up to the eruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "We misunderstood the situation," Williams said in an interview this week. "We 
had fallen into thinking the volcano was stable when it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 In their article in Nature, the scientists say Galeras, like other recently 
eruptive volcanoes, including Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines, Arenal Volcano 
in Costa Rica and Redoubt Volcano in Alaska, showed an increase in both sulfur 
dioxide emissions and long-period, usually low-level seismicity, in the buildup 
phase preceding an eruption. 
</P>
<P>
 At Galeras, for example, emissions of sulfur dioxide rose as high as 5,000 
metric tons per day. And low-frequency earthquakes, triggered by the volcanic 
activity and lasting up to three minutes, occurred by the hundreds. Williams 
said, "It is a pattern that is very unlike other earthquakes. They rise very 
slowly and they last for a long period." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, in the last three days before the eruption, there was "a clear 
drop," or "a pause" in such activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the volcanoes approach eruption, they are sealed off as far as the escape 
of gases is concerned, and there is a sudden quiescence in seismicity," 
Williams explained in the interview. "Internal pressure apparently builds up 
during this period, and then the eruption takes place." 
</P>
<P>
 At Galeras, the scientists thought they were safe, because they detected 
little seismicity and little of what is known as degassing, or the emission of 
gases, particularly sulfur dioxide. But that turned out to be a bad sign. "It 
fooled us," Williams said, and the Jan. 14, 1993, eruption "caused an energy 
release that was the highest on the mountain in three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, by studying prior instrumental records and examining the sequence of 
events after the January eruption -- including another eruption March 23, 1993 
-- they were impressed by the pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching for such pauses could become an important means of reducing volcanic 
dangers, the scientists believe. Although cities very close to volcanoes, such 
as Pasto, would still be in danger in a huge Pinatubo-like eruption, the 
populace could be evacuated.

HIDDEN INGREDIENTS IN FOODS CONCERN ALLERGY SPECIALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After watching two young patients with milk allergies react to dill 
pickle-flavored potato chips, a doctor warns it's sometimes the hidden 
ingredients that get you. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 10 minutes of snacking on the chips, a 2-year-old girl developed facial 
swelling and hives; a 9-year-old boy developed those symptoms, plus an itchy, 
swollen throat. 
</P>
<P>
 The packages didn't list milk or milk products as ingredients, so Dr. Wade 
T.A. Watson took a closer look at what goes into "dill pickle seasonings" and 
"spices." 
</P>
<P>
 After inquiring about the ingredients in at least two manufacturers' products, 
he learned that one brand contained whey, while another contained lactose and 
casein. All three are milk products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend a lot of time educating our patients to read labels," said Watson, 
an assistant professor at the University of Manitoba's pediatrics department, 
who discussed hidden ingredients Monday during the annual meeting of the 
American Academy of Allergy and Immunology. "In this case, the ingredients were 
not listed," Watson said. "Reactions can occur when patients are being 
conscientious. All packaging should list all foods." 
</P>
<P>
 Both children, who are Canadian, became sick after eating Old Dutch chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Dutch Foods Inc. of Roseville, Minn., said its American product contains a 
complete ingredients list, including whey and lactose, to comply with U.S. 
labeling requirements. But in Canada, the laws are less stringent and the 
product is labeled more vaguely. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Aanenson, whose family owns Old Dutch Foods Inc., said he'd be happy to 
offer a more detailed ingredient list. But he said the problem was that the 
spice manufacturers fear competition and disclose to his company just enough to 
stay within the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a food company's worst nightmare to have a problem, whether it's an 
allergic reaction or something else. But for the most part, that's out of our 
control, because we don't make those flavors ourselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian company says it will modify its labels to exceed the requirements 
of Canadian food and drug laws and try to include ingredients known to set off 
allergies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making a change because we feel it's important that if people have 
those allergies, they be informed of the ingredients in the product," said 
Emily Smith, a company purchasing manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson advises his patients with milk allergies to avoid processed foods whose 
labels list such general ingredients as natural or artificial flavoring, spices 
and seasoning.

O.C. POLITICAL CONSULTING FIRM, PAC NAMED IN MONEY-LAUNDERING PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prominent political consulting firm and a political action committee, both 
based in Orange County, are under investigation by San Bernardino County 
authorities as part of an alleged money-laundering scheme, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation led to the arrests Tuesday of a failed political candidate 
in Victorville and his chief supporter, who allegedly laundered more than 
$10,000 in campaign contributions through the Tustin-based political action 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten search warrants were served March 1 on various Orange County businesses, 
including the Corona del Mar offices of Ellis/Hart Associates, Inc., whose 
former client, Michael T. Gallagher, was arrested Tuesday and booked on 
suspicion of one felony count of perjury and four misdemeanor counts of failure 
to report campaign expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher, 44, was booked Tuesday and released on his own recognizance. A 
prominent developer in Victorville, he narrowly lost in his bid for election to 
the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors in June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet F. Early, 54, a Victorville printer who allegedly contributed more than 
$10,000 to Gallagher by laundering the money through the Non-Partisan Public 
Policy Advocates of Tustin, was arrested Tuesday and booked on suspicion of two 
misdemeanor counts of state campaign violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Orange County connection, no one from the Ellis/Hart company or 
the political action committee is likely to be charged with criminal 
wrongdoing, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are many details of the case yet to be looked at, and some we can't 
talk about, at least not now," said David Whitney, a deputy district attorney 
in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney said the political action committee "seemed to be interested in 
pretending to be an independent organization but appeared, in fact, to be under 
his strings," meaning Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that each of the Orange County businesses named in search warrants, 
including Ellis/Hart, are still being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ellis, a partner in Ellis/Hart, denied Wednesday that his firm is the 
subject of an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A former client of ours was arrested for money laundering," Ellis said. "We 
can't control what our clients do. That client was charged. We were not. And we 
are not going to be. The (San Bernardino County) D.A. simply came to us and 
asked for files on our former client (Gallagher), which we were happy to turn 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 29, 1992, just two days before he faced San Bernardino County 
Supervisor Marsha Turoci and two other supervisorial candidates, Gallagher 
allegedly wrote two checks totaling $10,758.25 to Early. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, she wrote two new checks for the same amount and sent them to the 
Non-Partisan Public Policy Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin group then divided the money among various local subcontractors -- 
printers, mailers, etc. -- for the purpose of producing a "hit piece" that was 
distributed to San Bernardino County voters by this nonpartisan group, 
investigators said. The piece was designed to "smear" Turoci, who later won the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also used contributed monies to support and oppose other candidates 
in Orange County, one of whom -- former Laguna Niguel Councilman Paul M. 
Christiansen -- reported the alleged improprieties more than a year ago, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Gallagher faces a maximum penalty of two years in state prison 
and a $30,000 fine. The maximum penalty for Early would be two years in jail 
and a $4,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers of the political action committee couldn't be reached for comment 
Wednesday.

THREE'S NO CHARM: DUCKS GET SHUT OUT AGAIN; HOCKEY: BUFFALO GOALIE HASEK IS TOO 
MUCH FOR ANEMIC ANAHEIM IN 3-0 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Mighty Ducks are laying goose eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 They were shut out for the third time in a row on Wednesday -- this time by 
the Buffalo Sabres and goaltender Dominik Hasek, 3-0, in front of 17,174 at 
Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, they were shut out by Chicago, 3-0. On Sunday, San Jose shut 
them out, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 That's 12-0 over the past three games, and they have a scoreless streak of 188 
minutes and 23 seconds. They haven't scored since Joe Sacco's goal at 11:37 of 
the third period of last Friday's victory over Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't put our fingers on it," right wing Todd Ewen said. "If we could 
change it, we would. Sometimes we're working too hard, sometimes not hard 
enough. We're just not jelling. We're just not scoring goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday, the Ducks hadn't been shut out twice in a row all season. Now 
it's three, and they face Chicago -- and perhaps goalie Ed Belfour -- again on 
Friday. They can rest easy on one account, though:  
</P>
<P>
 The NHL record for consecutive games without scoring is eight, set by the 
1928-29 Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' wretched offensive stretch has come at the most crucial point of 
their first season. Had they beaten San Jose, they would have trailed the 
Sharks by a single point in the race for the final Western Conference playoff 
spot. Now they are seven behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, they have lost to some of the NHL's best goalies -- San Jose's Arturs 
Irbe, Chicago's Belfour and Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasek arrived with a 1.95 goals-against average -- the lowest in the NHL. With 
the shutout, it is now 1.91. For an idea of how good that is, consider that 
Montreal's Patrick Roy -- often called the best goalie in the world -- stood at 
2.31 before Wednesday's games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last three games we haven't seen the goalie make a mistake," Coach Ron 
Wilson said. "Sometimes a mistake gives you a little lift. But we have to stick 
to the program. We'll work our way out of this." 
</P>
<P>
 The shutout was Hasek's sixth of the season, and truth be told, his night 
wasn't that tough. He needed to make only 24 saves, and one of the best was 
when he stopped Mark Ferner from close range during the second period. Shortly 
afterward, when the Ducks came down on a 2-on-1 rush, Hasek blocked Jarrod 
Skalde's shot from an angle and somehow recovered to fend off Garry Valk's 
rebound attempt even though he was already down. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck goalie Guy Hebert made some good saves, too, but Brad May broke the 
scoreless tie at 8:37 of the second period when two Ducks went to cover Donald 
Audette, leaving May open long enough to beat Hebert. 
</P>
<P>
 May added a second goal at 7:13 of the third, also assisted by Audette, and 
Alexander Mogilny scored the final goal later in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' power play is awful and getting worse. In the past couple of weeks, 
the Ducks have sunk lower and lower in the standings until they now rank 25th 
at 14.5% after going 0 for 5 against Buffalo. Only Tampa Bay is worse -- and 
marginally at that, at 14.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have scored on only eight of their last 98 opportunities with a man 
advantage -- and only twice in their last 56.

NHL ROUNDUP; NO DEAL FOR GARTNER, WHO IS BIG DEAL FOR RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Wednesday began, Mike Gartner was hearing reports that he and Ranger goalie 
Glenn Healy were about to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 As it ended, Gartner found himself being mentioned in the same sentence as 
some NHL Hall of Famers, present and future -- Gordie Howe, Wayne Gretzky, 
Marcel Dionne, Phil Esposito, Mike Gartner , Bobby Hull. 
</P>
<P>
 That was because Gartner, a quiet gunner at right wing for the Rangers, scored 
his 611th goal to move past Hull into fifth place on the all-time list as New 
York beat the Washington Capitals, 7-5, at Halifax, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 106 goals behind Esposito and not about to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not actively trying to trade anybody," Ranger General Manager Neil Smith 
said. "I am not (shopping) his services around the NHL." 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner, 34, scored his 28th goal of the season at 11:39 of the second period 
when he slipped his own rebound between the legs of Capital goalie Olaf Kolzig. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not too many people can say they scored their 611th goal in Halifax," said 
Gartner, who got a standing ovation from a crowd of 9,200. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really appreciated that," said Gartner, who has shunned the spotlight 
during his 15-year career. "It was a very nice thing to do, a nice touch of 
class." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 5, Calgary 1 -- Dino Ciccarelli scored a goal and became the 40th 
player to record 1,000 points in helping the Red Wings at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 4, Tampa Bay 1 -- The Whalers got four consecutive goals in the first 
10 minutes at Hartford, with U.S. Olympian Ted Crowley getting his first in the 
NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 4, Dallas 2 -- Dave Andreychuk broke a seven-game drought with two 
goals to lead the Maple Leafs at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 7, St. Louis 2 -- Lyle Odelein had three power-play goals to lead the 
Canadiens at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, Edmonton 3 -- Dave Lowry scored two goals as the Panthers won at 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 5, New York Islanders 4 -- The Canucks rallied from a 3-1 deficit at 
Vancouver with goals by Cliff Ronning, Murray Craven, Pavel Bure and Adrien 
Plavsic.

MORNING BRIEFING: IF THIS SAILOR MAKES THE CUT, HUSBAND WILL HAVE TO BABY-SIT

 Bill Koch, who spent $60 million to shake up the staid yachting world with his 
1992 America's Cup victory, plans a new twist for his title defense in San 
Diego next year: the first all-women team in the 142-year history of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch said the women don't need to be experienced sailors. He said he wants 
good athletes with the right attitude who can be trained to handle a boat. 
Lynne J. Shore is one who will make an effort. If she is chosen, it will bring 
another little twist to the team. Her husband worked with Koch on the 1992 
effort while she stayed home with the kids in Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time, there's a little role reversal," she said. "He'll appreciate me a 
little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Add America's Cup: PACT 95 syndicate skipper Kevin Mahaney, commenting on 
Koch's lavish press conference at the New York Plaza: "He spent more on that 
than we'll spend on our entire compound." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Gene Tunney was Ring magazine's first fighter of the year in 
1928. Who has been selected the most times? 
</P>
<P>
 Does Bo hold a grudge? : Bo Schembechler, who was fired when Mike Ilitch 
bought the Detroit Tigers, showed up at Port Charlotte, Fla., for the Tigers' 
exhibition against the Texas Rangers. After visiting with old friends before 
the game, Bo sat in the Rangers' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "No! I'm not mad at anybody. It's just shady over here, that's all," 
Schembechler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse than a shank: PGA Tour golfers would do better sticking to the fairways 
and staying away from the snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Wiebe will be sidelined at least six weeks recovering from a broken 
shoulder suffered in a Colorado skiing accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Phil Mickelson broke a leg skiing in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Hometown hero: When Tony Smith scored a career-high 25 points and had 10 
rebounds in a 106-84 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, it was doubly pleasing 
to the Laker guard. He had played at Milwaukee's Wauwatosa East High and 
Marquette.  
</P>
<P>
 Babe's memorabilia: The bat Babe Ruth used to hit his 56th home run in 1921 
will be auctioned by Sotheby's April 9 in New York. The auction house estimates 
the bat's worth at $40,000 to $50,000. Ruth sent the bat to a Boston booking 
agent and it was displayed for years in B.F. Keith's Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Late bloomer: Merle Ball didn't take up golf until he was 65 and retired, but 
once he got the bug he played so much he was named Golf Nut of the Year by the 
Golf Nut Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 74, he earned the accolade by playing golf in all 50 states in 51 days, 
plus playing 220 holes in one day at the Sun 'N Lake course in Sebring, Fla. -- 
110 holes right-handed and 110 as a lefty. 
</P>
<P>
 Overheated: Ball Night at Miami Arena for a Heat-Boston Celtic game ended up a 
fiasco in the fourth quarter when fans showered the court with several dozen 
palm-sized souvenir basketballs given out before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Boston's Sherman Douglas: "I guess they won't have Ball Night anymore. 
Lord knows they won't have Bat Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali, once as Clay, four times as Ali. Joe 
Louis was named four times.

NBA ROUNDUP; FOR A CHANGE, PISTONS WIN; DUMARS GETS 44 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Dumars took over in the fourth quarter, but that's nothing new for the 
Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 What's new is, they won. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumars scored 22 points in the last 7 1/2 minutes Wednesday at Auburn Hills, 
where Detroit beat the New Jersey Nets, 114-97. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished with 44 points, including 19 during a 22-4 fourth-quarter run that 
started when the Pistons' lead was only 87-84. Dumars began the run with a fall 
away jump shot and ended it with a three-point play as Detroit won for the 
first time since Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after the Pistons had ended a seven-game losing streak that Dumars 
could enjoy his night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 42 points the other night in Milwaukee and it didn't mean anything 
because we didn't get the win," he said. "It was a big win for us because we 
took a step up in the fourth quarter when it counted." 
</P>
<P>
 They had taken a step back only two nights before, when the Knicks closed them 
out with a 42-12 spurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Mills had 30 points and 13 rebounds for Detroit, and rookie guard 
Lindsey Hunter, filling in for the injured Isiah Thomas, had 18 points and a 
career-high 15 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat was the third in four games for New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 122, Utah 99 -- This was the worst loss of the season for the Jazz, 
and it ended a 10-game winning streak. The game at Portland marked the fourth 
in five nights for the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Strickland tied his season high with 27 for the Trail Blazers, who have 
won nine consecutive games at home and 10 of 11 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 105, Milwaukee 94 -- Reggie Miller scored 10 of his 22 points in the 
final quarter at Milwaukee as the Pacers won for the 15th time in 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Vin Baker had 21 points for the Bucks, who lost for the 16th time in 24 
home games. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 90, Atlanta 83 -- Patrick Ewing scored nine of his 25 points in the 
final 5:24 as the Knicks extended their winning streak to four games and 
climbed to within a game of the Hawks in the East. Atlanta lost for only the 
fourth time in 30 games at its Omni. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 117, Philadelphia 101 -- Shaquille O'Neal had 40 points and 14 
rebounds at Philadelphia as the Magic extended the 76ers' losing streak to 14 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 102, Denver 80 -- Glen Rice scored 26 points as the Heat maintained a 
double-digit lead throughout the second half at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Rony Seikaly had 22 points for the Heat, which has won eight of nine games and 
has an average margin of victory of 20.9 points in those victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 104, Minnesota 96 -- Mitch Richmond scored 35 points as the Kings 
snapped a five-game losing streak and earned a rare victory on the road. The 
Timberwolves, who lost their sixth consecutive game and for the 18th time in 20 
games, have only one starter, Doug West, at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 142, Washington 106 -- Cedric Ceballos had 36 points and 10 rebounds 
and Charles Barkley scored 24 points for the Suns at Landover, Md., in their 
most lopsided victory of the season.

SKIING / WORLD CUP AT MAMMOTH; OLYMPIC FAVORITES WIN THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Three weeks too late, the Olympic favorites in women's super-G crossed the 
finish line and took their expected bows on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was handing out medals here Wednesday. Only handshakes, World Cup 
points and American dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's Katja Seizinger restored order on the circuit by winning the first 
post-Olympic super-G with a time of 1 minute 20.07 seconds, a half-second 
faster than Bibiana Perez of Italy, who finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilde Gerg, also of Germany, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizinger-Perez-Gerg: They might have shared Olympic glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizinger and Perez are the world's top two ranked super-G skiers. Gerg ranks 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened at Lillehammer? 
</P>
<P>
 Seizinger and Perez both crashed, and Gerg, who won the last pre-Olympic World 
Cup super-G, finished a disappointing 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 These events helped clear an improbable gold-medal path for the American 
longshot, Diann Roffe-Steinrotter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's race at Mammoth went so true to form that Roffe-Steinrotter skied 
a very good race and finish 15th. Picabo Street, the Olympic silver medalist in 
downhill, finished 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were disappointed in the Olympics," Seizinger said, speaking on behalf of 
Perez, whose English isn't quite as good. "We met on the slopes at Kvitfjell 
and talked. You have to risk everything at the Olympics. We raced good until we 
went out. It's OK, now that we are back." 
</P>
<P>
 Seizinger, who avenged her super-G disappointment by claiming the Olympic 
downhill, is the World Cup leader in both events and is, according to Canada's 
Kerrin Lee-Gartner, "skiing in another league." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, skiing ninth, seized the lead with a time of 1:20.57, but Seizinger 
left no doubt when she raced from 14th start position into first. 
</P>
<P>
 The course at Mammoth, playing host to its first World Cup, held up well under 
sunny skies and temperatures in the high 40s. But no one from the back of the 
pack was about to challenge the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Street, starting 42nd, made the most dramatic leap to finish 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite not having a top-10 U.S. finisher, the race ranked as a shining moment 
for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Super-G has been the U.S. women team's weakest event, which made 
Roffe-Steinrotter's Olympic gold all the more stunning. 
</P>
<P>
 Street completed her first super-G of the season after four washouts and 
posted a career-best finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter, despite finishing 1.63 seconds off the pace, celebrated her 
highest World Cup placement this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous again," Roffe-Steinrotter said. "I think that's just the way it 
is for me right now. The adrenaline level is up." 
</P>
<P>
 As she had done at Lillehammer, Roffe-Steinrotter started slow but made up 
time on the more technical bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Lillehammer, though, she ran out of course at Mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just needed more turns," she said. "I needed the course to be 10, 15 
seconds longer to be better." 
</P>
<P>
 For Street, the result could mark a turning point in her super-G career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes experience," Street said. "Believe it or not, after going out so 
many times, I learned what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Street was surprised her concentration held up given the whirlwind that has 
been her life since winning Olympic silver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually got butterflies when I touched American ground in the plane," she 
said. "I almost started crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Since, she has been busy sorting through her mail and endorsement 
possibilities. She said she hopes to use her fame to inspire children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping to get a spot on the Sesame Street Show," Street said. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Other American finishes in Wednesday's super-G: Shannon Nobis, 23rd; Hilary 
Lindh, 25th; Megan Gerety, 40th; Heidi Voelker 46th; Eva Twardokens, 51st, 
Krista Schmidinger, 54th. . . . Picabo Street will skip today's slalom, race in 
Friday's super-G, and then rest for next week's downhill at the World Cup 
finals at Vail, Colo. She will then return home March 18 for a parade to be 
held in her honor in Sun Valley, Idaho. . . . First-place winners this week 
receive $8,400, with $4,200 for second and $1,400 for third.

 New Orleans investors headed by former Houston Mayor Fred Hofheinz and

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: CLASS OF THIS CLASS IS ROBINSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One writer, one vote. 
</P>
<P>
 First Team --Guards Jason Kidd of California and Jalen Rose of Michigan; 
Forwards Donyell Marshall of Connecticut, Grant Hill of Duke and Glenn Robinson 
of Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd makes it because there are no point guards like him in the college game. 
We're not sure there are any point guards like him in the NBA, which is where 
he probably will be playing next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, a player we've blasted in the past, finally has discovered the benefits 
of mixing his considerable flair with on-court maturity. For the first time in 
his three-year Michigan career, Rose's walk has matched the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall is the Northeast version of Grant Hill. He began earning rave reviews 
during summer international play. Now we know why. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, the thinking man's player, can do the improbable: control games with or 
without scoring.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has a flaw in his game somewhere . . . doesn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 Second Team --Guards Melvin Booker of Missouri and B.J. Tyler of Texas; 
forwards Jervaughn Scales of Southern and Corliss Williamson of Arkansas; 
center Juwan Howard of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Almosts --Guards Khalid Reeves of Arizona, Derrick Phelps of North Carolina 
and Dan Cross of Florida; forwards Lou Roe of Massachusetts and Lamond Murray 
of Cal; center Carlos Rogers of Tennessee State and Clifford Rozier of 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 Player of the Year --Robinson, followed by Kidd, then Hill, then Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman of the Year --Joe Smith of Maryland, followed by Louisiana State's 
Ronnie Henderson, Mississippi State's Erick Dampier, Cincinnati's Dontonio 
Wingfield and Wisconsin's Rashard Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach of the Year --Norm Stewart of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who can lead a team through an unbeaten season in the tough Big Eight 
gets our vote. The last time it happened was 1971, and Kansas advanced to the 
Final Four. Missouri is good enough to do the same.  
</P>
<P>
 Our runner-ups were Florida's Lon Krueger, Kentucky's Rick Pitino, Notre 
Dame's John MacLeod, Maryland's Gary Williams, Duke's Mike Krzyzewski and Cal's 
Todd Bozeman. THE CAMPANELLI WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 14 months have come and gone since Cal issued a pink slip to Lou 
Campanelli and yet, he still can't stomach the thought of watching the Golden 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too painful," the former Cal coach said. "I wouldn't put myself through 
that. I just put positive thoughts through my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Campanelli, who was fired by then-Cal Athletic Director Bob Bockrath for 
alleged mistreatment of players, is so high on life these days that he wants to 
return to coaching. Now then, will anyone want him back? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the coaches in the country know what I stand for as a man, as a 
coach," he said. "They know I built two respectable programs through the 
framework of the NCAA. My players graduate and people know that I didn't take 
any shortcuts to get a program built at either place." 
</P>
<P>
 Campanelli said he wouldn't take just any job. Of course, he might not have 
much of a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I coach," he said, "I want it to be a fun job, a challenge. Some place 
where I can roll up my sleeves and get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Since being replaced by Bozeman, a former assistant, last February, Campanelli 
has been busy. He brooded. He steamed. He filed lawsuits. He also traveled, 
going to South Korea, Greece and to mystical Tobacco Road, where he spent 
quality time with coaching buddies Dean Smith, Dave Odom and Krzyzewski. It was 
during his preseason visit to Odom at Wake Forest that Campanelli said he 
realized how much he missed the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when it was really kind of painful," he said. "That was the first time 
in 32 years that I hadn't been on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Campanelli did some television color commentary on Missouri Valley Conference 
games, but who wants to spend the rest of their life watching Wichita State? He 
also appeared as a college recruiter in the movie, "Blue Chips." About the best 
we can say is that he nodded well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to go," he said. "Whoever gets me in whatever capacity--coaching . 
. . the TV thing--they're going to get somebody with a lot of stored up 
energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Campanelli said he has his health, a supportive family and a new perspective 
on life. Well, almost new. He hasn't exactly adopted the forgive-and-forget 
attitude with Cal. "I'm still involved in litigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A prediction: Campanelli, who plans to attend the Final Four in Charlotte, 
N.C., will get his second chance. Lots of openings. And lots of athletic 
directors who think college basketball owes him one. WISHFUL THINKING 
</P>
<P>
 If it's all the same to Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson, he'd prefer to be 
seeded No. 1 in the NCAA Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: location, location, location. The Midwest finishes in nearby 
Dallas, whereas the Southeast Regional finishes in Knoxville, home of 
Southeastern Conference partner Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Richardson's choice.  
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a request line, I'd like to have the number," said Missouri's 
Stewart, who was none too pleased with the news. "Am I missing something? 
Aren't (the Razorbacks) in the Southeast Conference now?" 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, Missouri (Midwest), Arkansas (Southeast), Connecticut (East) are 
probably assured of being seeded No. 1. The remaining No. 1 in the West is 
likely to go to North Carolina or Duke, though Arizona and Purdue still have a 
chance. The Wildcats or Boilermakers become serious candidates if North 
Carolina or Duke don't win the Atlantic Coast tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, Kentucky's Pitino predicts upsets galore in the early rounds 
of the NCAA madness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's the difference between this year and past years," he said. "I think 
the first-round seed is very important. You could conceivably get a tremendous 
talent advantage. But if this year you're a three, four, five seed, you're not 
going to have that tremendous talent advantage. You're going to have four 
flat-out wars to get to the Final Four." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Pitino, who said he couldn't even make an educated guess on a Final Four 
field: "In the second round, I would not be surprised if anybody loses in the 
country. The second round is where you're going to see the biggest number of 
upsets." THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Pins ready, the NCAA tournament selection committee convenes Friday in Kansas 
City to separate the at-large teams from the bubble teams. A list of bubbles: 
ACC--Maryland, Virginia, Georgia Tech; Atlantic 10--George Washington; Big 
East)--Georgetown, Villanova; Big Eight--Oklahoma; Metro Athletic--Tulane; 
Midwestern Collegiate--Xavier, Evansville; Missouri Valley--Tulsa; 
Pac-10--Stanford, Washington State; SEC)--Vanderbilt, Mississippi State; 
Southwest--Texas A&M; Western Athletic--Brigham Young, Fresno State. . . . 
Arkansas fans, apparently overdosing on sooey-pig fever, are buying up every 
SEC tournament ticket they can. The Razorbacks are ranked No. 1 and better yet, 
are a short drive to the supposed neutral site of the SEC tournament--Memphis, 
which just happens to be one of Richardson's favorite recruiting locations. 
Said Georgia Coach Hugh Durham of the league tournament: "More than likely it's 
going to be an Arkansas Invitational." . . . St. John's, an NCAA tournament 
no-show unless it wins the Big East tournament, still has reason to celebrate. 
Zendon Hamilton, a 6-foot-11 center considered to be one of the country's best 
high school players, has chosen hometown St. John's over Villanova. Still 
undecided is New York guard Felipe Lopez, the No. 1 high school prospect. His 
reported short list: St. John's, Seton Hall and Syracuse. After losing big-time 
New York recruit Adonal Foyle to Colgate and the Patriot League, the Big East 
appears to have salvaged its reputation by keeping Hamilton and Lopez in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roy Williams-to-Tennessee rumor refuses to go away, partly because 
Williams hasn't completely shot it down. Said the Kansas coach this week: "I 
haven't spoken to anyone from Tennessee. I don't plan on speaking to anyone 
from Tennessee. They haven't shown any interest in me. That's basically where 
that stands." In coach-speak, a non-denial denial. We still think Williams will 
stay put, but Kansas fans might want to keep this in mind: Williams is from 
North Carolina, which, for the geographically illiterate, is only a few hours 
from the Knoxville campus. Also, Williams used to work the summer camps for 
former Tennessee Coach Ray Mears. . . . Another rumor to consider: Providence 
Coach Rick Barnes to Clemson, Nevada Las Vegas Coach Rollie Massimino to 
Providence. It makes sense. The situation at UNLV is a mess and Massimino and 
his family miss the East Coast lifestyle. . . . The four new members of the Big 
Eight Conference--Southwest Conference refugees Texas, Texas Tech, Texas A&M 
and Baylor--haven't even joined the league yet and already relations are a tiny 
bit prickly. Seems there have been rumblings of eventually moving the 
conference tournament from Kansas City to possibly a location in Texas. 
Informed of the idea, Missouri's Stewart snapped back, "Well, I'd really like 
to go to Lubbock (campus outpost for Texas Tech)." Asked why, Stewart said, "I 
don't know, Mac Davis has a song there. Just a lot of things that seem like a 
nice place to go." Said a Big Eight school official: "I'm sure that will make 
our new friends (in the SWC) happy." Stewart's comment might be politically 
incorrect, but who cares? The Big Eight, which has a contract with the Kemper 
Arena in Kansas City through 2000, would be nuts to move. As for pressure from 
the SWC Four, Kansas' Williams was quick to remind everyone that "there's eight 
of us who asked those other four to join." . . . Northwestern Coach Ricky 
Byrdsong, back from a leave of a absence, has sent a letter of apology to 
members of the school's booster club for his antics last month at Minnesota. 
Despite the many distractions, the Wildcats still have a chance for an NIT bid.

PACIFIC 10 BASKETBALL / DAN HAFNER; REVIVED ARIZONA VOWS NO EARLY COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little more than a month ago, it seemed almost certain Arizona's dominance 
of the Pacific 10 Conference was over.  
</P>
<P>
 A weak Washington team humiliated the Wildcats, who were 6-3 at the halfway 
point. Arizona had a tough schedule ahead, including games at Stanford and 
California and a home game against UCLA, already two games ahead in the 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight games later, the Wildcats still have only three conference losses, have 
clinched a share of their sixth title in seven years and look like a stronger 
team than a year ago when they won the title with a 17-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chris Mills and Ed Stokes, two powerful performers, are gone from the 
1992-93 team, the memory of losing to Santa Clara in the first round of the 
NCAA tournament is not forgotten.  
</P>
<P>
 To be the Pac-10's No. 1 representative, Arizona must defeat Arizona State at 
Tempe on Saturday, and although last year's tournament disaster is not 
forgotten, the players are not dwelling on it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about whether we're one of the seeded teams," guard Damon 
Stoudamire said. "We learned that on any given day, any team good enough to be 
there can beat you. This time, I can assure you we'll be ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves make up one of the country's best backcourts, but 
it was not until the big men, Joseph Blair, Ray Owes and Kevin Flanagan, 
started contributing that the Wildcats (25-4 and 14-3 in league play) reached 
their potential. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning their last eight games, Arizona has overwhelmed most of its 
opponents. In six of the victories, it won by at least 13 points. The Wildcats 
defeated Cal by 19, USC by 33 and UCLA by 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Frieder of Arizona State said this is Olson's finest coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had better talent, but this is the best team he's had since I came out 
here (1989)," Frieder said. "My top teams at Michigan were led by guards and he 
has two of the best in the country. This team can go a long way in the NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh-ranked Wildcats will earn the conference title outright by 
defeating Arizona State, but in a three-way tie Cal would be the league's No. 1 
representative.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, Cal and UCLA are a cinch to be in the NCAA tournament, and a fourth 
team could be determined tonight at Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, which has improved from last year's 2-16 in the conference to 9-7, 
would practically assure itself of a berth by sweeping its final two games in 
Washington. Mike Montgomery's much-improved Cardinal (16-9 overall) is battling 
Washington State (18-10, 8-8) for a possible berth and would have a chance by 
beating them, assuring itself of no worse than a tie for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the big weekend for us," Washington State Coach Kelvin Sampson said. 
"Fortunately, we are coming into (the) game playing the best basketball of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit a slump when Mark Hendrickson was out, but he is back and we are at a 
peak. We know Stanford will be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I see it is that if we beat Stanford, we should be in the tournament. 
If we beat both (California on Saturday) we are a cinch." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fans at Berkeley, with the banner "Don't Go," and the chant, "one more 
year," let sophomore Jason Kidd and junior Lamond Murray know how they felt. 
But the Cal players haven't let on what they plan to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, who almost certainly will be named the conference's most valuable 
player, said he wasn't sure what he would do. Murray said he didn't want to 
discuss it until the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a chance to sit down and think about whether I'm leaving," Kidd 
said. "I'm going to talk to lots of people, but it will be my decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific 10 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lamond Murray, who some coaches think should be co-player of the year with 
Jason Kidd, was conference player of the week for the third time. Murray had 44 
points and 12 rebounds in Cal's sweep of the Oregon schools. . . . In the tight 
race for scoring honors, Murray is averaging 24.111 points to 24.103 for 
Arizona guard Khalid Reeves.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; INDIANA LOSS GOES TO KNIGHT'S HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Knight probably had a headache after his 18th-ranked Indiana Hoosiers lost 
for the third time in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State's 94-79 Big Ten victory at East Lansing on Wednesday was only 
part of the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Television cameras caught Knight bumping foreheads with Sherron Wilkerson 
after the Hoosier freshman was benched for complaining to the referee about a 
noncall. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight did not address the incident afterward, and it was unclear from the 
videotape whether the head butt was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Respert didn't help Knight's headache either, scoring 40 points for 
Michigan State (19-10, 10-7). 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, Coach Jud Heathcote said, should add to the Spartans' schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gets us the (NCAA tournament) bid, so we have a lot more basketball left 
to play," he said. "I'm really happy with the way we seem to be peaking at just 
the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same time Indiana (18-8, 11-6) seems to be hitting a valley, though 
Alan Henderson scored 41 points for the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Michigan 81, Penn St. 72 -- Juwan Howard scored 21 points and Jalen Rose 
added 20 at Ann Arbor, Mich., as the Wolverines moved back into a first-place 
tie with Purdue in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 With Penn State center John Amaechi sidelined because of a sprained ankle, the 
Wolverines (21-6, 13-4) dominated inside, outrebounding Penn State, 41-30. 
Michigan pulled away from the Nittany Lions (12-14, 5-12) in the final 9:40 of 
the first half with a 21-10 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois 90, No. 20 Minnesota 75 -- Jerry Hester had 20 points at Champaign, 
Ill., where the Illini strengthened their chances for an NCAA tournament bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois (17-9, 10-7) rained three-point baskets on the Gophers (20-11, 10-8), 
outscoring Minnesota, 33-9, on three-pointers. OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 At Philadelphia, Drexel (25-4) scored the last 11 points of the game in an 
86-78 victory over Maine (20-9), clinching the North Atlantic Conference 
championship and an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament. . . . Michigan 
transfer Tony Tolbert scored 21 points to lead Detroit Mercy (16-13) to a 70-65 
victory over Evansville (21-10) in the championship game of the Midwestern 
Collegiate Conference at Indianapolis. The Titans did not earn an automatic 
NCAA berth because the MCC has lost its bid. . . . Michael Finley scored 27 
points for Wisconsin (17-9, 8-9), which rekindled its NCAA hopes with a 95-71 
Big Ten victory over Iowa (10-16, 4-13) at Madison.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; USC CAN END STANFORD'S TITLE STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The USC women's basketball team has a chance to win the Pacific 10 Conference 
title outright this weekend when it plays host to Oregon tonight at the Sports 
Arena and Oregon State on Saturday at the Lyon Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans can end Stanford's five-year conference championship streak with a 
sweep.If they stumble against either team, they will need help from Washington 
State or Washington, who play at Stanford this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (21-3 overall and 14-2 in the Pac-10) has a one-game lead over the 
Cardinal (20-5, 13-3) going into the final weekend of conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (15-10, 10-6), which plays host to Oregon State (16-9, 8-8) tonight and 
Oregon on Saturday, is battling the Beavers for fifth place and a probable 
at-large berth in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprising Oregon (18-7, 12-4) could tie for the Pac-10 title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, under first-year Coach Jody Runge, have won 11 of 13, losing twice 
to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's USC-Oregon State game, starting at 2 p.m., is a rematch between 6-5 
Lisa Leslie and Oregon State's 6-5 Kristina Lelas, from Croatia.  
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 6 at Corvallis, Leslie struck Lelas on the mouth with a backhand punch 
that knocked her to the floor. Television replays showed Lelas had grabbed 
Leslie's arm, precipitating the punch. EARL GUSTKEY

BIG WEST BASKETBALL / MEN'S TOURNAMENT; THIS NCAA BERTH IS UP FOR GRABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The basketball question of the week in this town might be: Who will represent 
the Big West in the NCAA tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps: Is this parity or parody? 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Farrell, Big West commissioner, says every conference team has a new 
life going into the tournament. That used to mean they all had an equal 
opportunity to lose to Nevada Las Vegas. This season, even at home in the 
Thomas & Mack Center, the Rebels appear to be just another team in a mediocre 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shake 'em up and see what happens," Long Beach State Coach Seth Greenberg 
said. "The league has been so wacky. Look at all the upsets. Who knows who has 
an advantage? 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean people who thought before the season that San Jose State would have a 
chance to beat UNLV for a third time in one year are the same people who think 
I'll be growing hair on my head again." 
</P>
<P>
 Even New Mexico State, the conference's closest thing to a dominating team, is 
vulnerable. The Aggies, 20-7 overall and Big West champions with a 12-6 record, 
have lost four of the last five and might need to win the tournament to ensure 
a berth in the NCAA field of 64. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't make those decisions, but that's more than a remote possibility," 
Aggie Coach Neil McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The games will begin today at 1 p.m. when 10th-seeded UC Irvine meets No. 7 UC 
Santa Barbara. Eighth-seeded Cal State Fullerton plays No. 9 Nevada at 3.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, No. 2 Utah State plays the winner of the Irvine-Santa Barbara game 
at 1 p.m., and No. 3 Long Beach State meets No. 6 Pacific at 3. No. 1 New 
Mexico State plays the winner of the Fullerton-Nevada game at 7 and No. 4 San 
Jose State plays No. 5 UNLV at 9.  
</P>
<P>
 Who's favored? Long Beach State, Utah State and San Jose State -- who finished 
in a three-way tie for second with 11-7 records -- enter the tournament with 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach won seven of its last nine games, Utah State seven of eight. And 
San Jose, the conference's only team with a winning road record (6-3), has won 
three in a row, including a final weekend of upset victories at UNLV and New 
Mexico State.  
</P>
<P>
 UNLV has the talent, and if the Rebels start winning, the home crowd could 
become a factor. But really, when coaches say "anybody could win," they 
actually mean it.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; MYSTIQUE OF JAPANESE PITCHER STILL ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A horde of Japanese media camped out early at Tempe Diablo Stadium to watch 
Seattle Mariner pitcher Makoto Suzuki and were rushing to the telephones once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Suzuki did not throw a 96-m.p.h. fastball as advertised, and the 
Angels were unimpressed, the mystique lives on. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzuki, 18, bidding to become only the second Japanese-born player to reach 
the major leagues, pitched two hitless innings in the Mariners' 5-3 victory 
over the Angels at Tempe, Ariz. He has given up only two hits in four innings 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought his ball kind of snuck up on you," Angel right fielder Tim Salmon 
said. "Other guys didn't think he was throwing that hard, but I think he'll be 
all right once he comes up with some off-speed pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sit here and say he's going to be a great pitcher, but he's 
got a decent arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzuki, who dropped out of school in Kobe, Japan, when he was 14, began his 
professional career in 1992 for class-A Salinas. His mornings were spent 
working on his pitching delivery, and his nights were spent cleaning the 
clubhouse and washing uniforms. He pitched for San Bernardino last season, 
yielding 59 hits and striking out 87 in 80 2/3 innings. He then received an 
$800,000 signing bonus from the Mariners after turning down 14 other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Mariners asked him what uniform number he wanted, he requested 911, 
saying, "That's what I call for help." He settled for 96, the velocity of his 
fastball. He has been compared to Roger Clemens, Dwight Gooden and Jim Palmer. 
Considering the Mariners' bullpen woes, they are serious about his chances.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's not here for the media," Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said. "He's here 
because he can make our team." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most beautiful sight the Angels have seen all spring occurred Wednesday 
when batboy Mike Glorioso walked through the clubhouse doors and attended his 
first Angel game since July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe he was walking," Angel second baseman Torey Lovullo said. 
"Really, it's a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Glorioso was left paralyzed while playing baseball last summer, suffering a 
compressed vertebrae. His surgery took nine hours, and doctors doubted whether 
he'd be able to walk again. He was hospitalized for three months, and Lovullo 
and shortstop Gary DiSarcina made sure he was not forgotten, visiting him at 
least once every home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 His neck is supported by a heavy brace, but he's walking again, and hopes to 
be back with the Angels by the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of guys in here that have made this possible," Glorioso said. 
"They supported me the whole way, and believe me, I'll be back to show them my 
appreciation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers didn't arrive until the fourth inning, spending 3 
1/2 hours in a Phoenix courtroom giving depositions for his lawsuit involving 
the Angels' bus crash on May 21, 1992. The Angels and former bullpen coach Rick 
Turner have settled their suits. Hitting coach Rod Carew is scheduled to give 
his deposition today. 
</P>
<P>
 "So excuse me if I sound confused today," Rodgers said, "I went through 3 1/2 
hours of testimony so I got all my ifs, ands and buts all mixed up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Anderson, the Angels' No. 1 pick in the 1993 draft, kept alive his 
chances of making the starting rotation by pitching three shutout innings. "I'm 
not just glad to be here, I want to make this team," said Anderson, who has 
added a slider. "If I didn't think that way, it would be a disservice to them 
and myself." . . . Reliever Bill Sampen has a good chance to earn a place in 
the bullpen after pitching two perfect innings. . . . The Angel pitching staff 
has Rodgers reconsidering his plan of carrying three catchers and 10 pitchers. 
He might carry two catchers and 11 pitchers. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DREIFORT IMPRESSIVE IN SHORT STINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His performance wasn't at all perfect, but Darren Dreifort showed the 
confidence, poise and talent that continues to impress team officials when he 
pitched two innings in the Dodgers' 8-5 victory over the Kansas City Royals on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort followed starter Ramon Martinez to pitch the fifth inning and quickly 
got into trouble, loading the bases on a single, a walk and a hit batter before 
walking in a run. But a visit by pitching coach Ron Perranoski settled him 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told him to stay on top of it a little more and get a fastball for the 
double play," Perranoski said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort then threw a sinking fastball to get out of trouble with a double 
play. He then struck out two batters the next inning, and gave up one hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very close to helping us out, very close," Mike Piazza said. "He got 
into that jam, but he came out it and did a hell of a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Dreifort makes the team will depend on the rest of the spring and 
perhaps on the number of pitchers the team carries. The past two seasons, the 
team carried 11, but Manager Tom Lasorda said Wednesday he didn't know if he 
would carry 10 or 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park is scheduled to make his second start Sunday when the Dodgers 
play the Montreal Expos at Vero Beach in their first televised game. . . . 
Kevin Gross, who was upset that Park was given his start last Monday against 
the New York Mets, is scheduled to pitch Friday. But there was some feeling 
among Dodger officials that Gross, who has been battling mild tendinitis, 
should not have pitched at all Monday. He pitched after Park against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really second-guessing myself just to put him in that game the other 
day -- I thought maybe he should be in a B game," Perranoski said. "He did a 
good job of holding back and I was happy about that, because there is no need 
to put him out in front of 6,000 people when he is not ready. But he is coming 
along fine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, trailing 5-2 in the seventh inning, put together a six-run rally. 
Piazza hit a two-run home run, his third of the spring, and Raul Mondesi added 
a two-run triple. Mondesi also made a nice catch in right-center of a ball hit 
by Greg Gagne. Jose Offerman was three for five and is batting .333 through six 
games. He is tied with Piazza with six runs batted in, the most on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry got his first RBI when he walked with the bases loaded in 
the fifth inning. He also stole a base. Strawberry, who has three hits in 14 at 
bats -- none for extra bases -- said that his two walks Wednesday are an 
encouraging sign. "I'm pleased with the walks because it means I am laying off 
bad pitches," Strawberry said. "That means it's going to happen, that I will 
start delivering. The more I play, the more comfortable I am becoming." 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Snyder took batting practice in the cages for the first time in more than 
a week. He was sidelined initially because of a sore back and then pulled a 
muscle in his side. . . . Pedro Astacio threw for the first time and reported 
no pain. MARYANN HUDSON

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; WICKED NORTH IS ALSO TALK OF THE SOUTH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even at Gulfstream Park, where the $500,000 Florida Derby will be run 
Saturday, they are rehashing the Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have never taken that horse down," said a jockey agent who saw 
the $1-million race on a telecast here last Saturday. "But I know what the 
stewards thought. They saw (Kent) Desormeaux, and he was riding three horses. 
He looked over five times to his left, where Myrakalu was trying to get 
through. The stewards out there have had their fill of Desormeaux. There was 
that not-riding-out-horses-to-the-wire business, and a few other things. He's 
not the most popular guy in town. Another rider in his spot might have been 
able to get away with what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Anita stewards -- Ingrid Fermin, Pete Pedersen and Tom Ward -- 
maintain they are not prejudiced against Desormeaux. The rider of The Wicked 
North, who won by 1 1/2 lengths before his number was taken down for crowding 
Myrakalu at the top of the stretch, is appealing his five-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Jones, who trains Stuka, the Big 'Cap winner by disqualification, thought 
that The Wicked North's number wouldn't be taken down, reasoning that in big 
races, stewards often permit more rodeo riding. The late Joe Manzi thought the 
same thing before his Fran's Valentine was disqualified from first in the first 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies in 1984, but he was wrong, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first race on the card ought to be as important as the Santa Anita 
Handicap," said Walter Blum, the Hall of Fame jockey who is a veteran steward 
at Gulfstream. "Any time people (jockeys) can get killed or there's potential 
for the public to get ripped off, it doesn't make any difference how big or 
little the race is." 
</P>
<P>
 With Phil Hersh, The Wicked North's owner, appealing the stewards' decision to 
the California Horse Racing Board, there is special interest in the March 19 
hearing, because it involves a judgment call, which is seldom overturned. It's 
believed to have happened only once in California, and the only time that it 
happened in Florida, Blum was involved, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was Hialeah's 1985 Flamingo Stakes, which was then a major prep for 
the Kentucky Derby. On paper, the Flamingo shaped up as a three-horse race that 
pitted Proud Truth, the Florida Derby winner, against Chief's Crown, the 
champion 2-year-old of 1984, and Stephan's Odyssey, winner of the '84 Hollywood 
Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Proud Truth went off a slight 6-5 favorite, but Chief's Crown led all the way 
to win by one length. Proud Truth was a neck faster than the late-running 
Stephan's Odyssey to take second place. 
</P>
<P>
 With his jockey, Don MacBeth, whipping left-handed, Chief's Crown drifted out 
slightly in the last sixteenth of a mile. To avoid clipping Chief's Crown's 
heels, Jorge Velasquez also went to the outside, where Stephan's Odyssey and 
Eddie Maple were rallying. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum would have been the senior steward in the judges' stand, but he was away, 
attending his mother's funeral. His replacement, an administrative aide from 
the state racing board's office, and the two other stewards disqualified 
Chief's Crown to second and gave the victory to Proud Truth. MacBeth spoke 
briefly with Chief's Crown's trainer, Roger Laurin, showered quickly and got in 
his car, driving to New York nonstop except to refuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was that mad," MacBeth said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Henryk deKwiatkowski, who owned Stephan's Odyssey, thought that both of the 
horses that finished ahead of his colt should have been disqualified. In lock 
step with his trainer, Woody Stephens, deKwiatkowski crashed the stewards' 
stand high above the track. Shouting was heard behind the closed door. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one veteran racing official referred to Chief's Crown's 
disqualification as a "comedy of errors." Some observers suggested Blum's 
presence would have made a difference. Asked about this the other day, Blum 
said: "They took enough heat at the time. I don't want to add to it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida racing rules, unlike California's, do not allow for an appeal of a 
judgment call by stewards. But John Galbreath, who owned Proud Truth, gave the 
state permission to review the outcome. "He was very sportsmanlike," Blum said. 
"He had absolutely nothing to gain." 
</P>
<P>
 After the race, Galbreath had seemed sheepish about accepting victory, and 
although he never said so publicly, his actions supported the widely held 
belief that the stewards had blown the call. 
</P>
<P>
 The racing board, seeking to bring in three stewards from other states to 
referee the hearing, had difficulty finding a full panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not right to be judging the judges," a steward from New York said. When 
Keene Dangerfield was called in Kentucky, he demurred: "I'd just as soon have a 
lobotomy." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, three veteran racing officials were hired. Nine days after the race, 
the review board overruled the stewards and made Chief's Crown the winner. But 
deKwiatkowski was out of luck. Stephan's Odyssey was left in third place.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even if Chief's Crown deserved the win," Walter Blum said this week, "what 
happened shouldn't have happened. It's not in racing's best interests to have 
judgment calls second-guessed." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the protest hearing over Saturday's Santa Anita Handicap, the race 
has already created more acrimony than racing needs. Besides Desormeaux versus 
the Santa Anita stewards, and Hersh versus the stewards, there was an ugly 
scene in the winner's circle, where angry fans threw objects. A woman with the 
Allen Paulson party started crying after being struck on the forehead by a 
cigarette lighter. It was her first visit to a racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulson, the owner of Stuka, has not escaped the controversy. Hersh has 
accused him of being an ungracious winner, barging into the winner's circle and 
insulting Hersh and his party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe that I'm being accused of that," Paulson said. "I was in my 
box and didn't get down to the winner's circle until real late. I don't even 
know Mr. Hersh. I am not a rude person, and it's horrible that he would say 
these things about me. I've been in the same position as Mr. Hersh and can 
understand his frustrations over losing a big race. But I think he owes me an 
apology."

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: MOTORCYCLE KING RIDING HIGH WITH DUAL CAREERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Auto racing is Eddie Lawson's main priority these days, but when you've won 
four world road racing championships on a motorcycle, it's difficult to turn 
down a good ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, 35, came out of a short retirement last March to win his second 
Daytona 200, the American Motorcyclist Assn.'s premier road race, and Sunday he 
will return to Daytona International Raceway to defend his title in the opening 
event of the AMA Superbike series. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way will I go back to motorcycles full time," Lawson said Wednesday after 
testing his Yamaha on the 3.5-mile circuit. "As soon as Daytona is over, I'll 
head for Phoenix to test my Indy Lights car with the Tasman team." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson will take over the car driven last year by Bryan Herta, who won the 
series by capturing seven of the 12 races. Herta is moving up to Indy cars this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't have any excuses now," Lawson said. "I'll be in a winning car, with 
the top team, and Bryan (Herta) is going to help me with my driving." 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Lawson's first full season in Indy Lights. He drove his first 
race in the final event of 1992 at Laguna Seca, and last year he had five 
top-10 finishes in six races, including a second at Laguna Seca and third at 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, who also won the Daytona 200 in 1986, won last year's race by running 
down leader Scott Russell, the national champion, on the final lap. At the 
finish, Lawson and his Vance & Hines Yamaha 250 were 0.051 seconds ahead of 
Russell's Kawasaki. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're basically on the same bike this year," Lawson said. "It's updated, of 
course, but it's pretty much the same. If anything, they've found a little more 
power. We'll need it because I know the other guys have made improvements, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, winning was a surprise. I had no idea what to expect. I wondered 
what I'd be able to do, but the bike was good and I guess I'm not too old to 
race with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be very difficult to win again. Everyone wants revenge, so I know 
I'll have to ride harder this year. At the same time, I think everyone will 
still have to race with me. I'm not saying I'm going to go out and (dominate), 
but I am saying I think they'll know they've been in a race when it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 The field will be one of the strongest in the 53 years of the Daytona 200. The 
entries include Russell, who went on to win the world Superbike championship 
last year; Doug Polen, a two-time world Superbike champion who won the national 
championship in 1993; former Superbike champion Fred Merkel, who will be 
Russell's Kawasaki teammate; and former Daytona winner Miguel Duhamel, on a 
Harley-Davidson. A Harley has not won America's premier race since 1973, when 
Cal Rayborn won. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, who had 31 Grand Prix victories while winning world championships in 
1984, 1986, 1988 and 1989, retired after a 1992 season in which he helped 
develop the Cagiva bike. He scored Cagiva's only GP victory in Hungary, then 
announced his retirement at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still love riding the bike in a race, but after 10 years I decided I needed 
something else," he said. "I had thought about car racing for a long time and 
now that I've made the change, I couldn't be happier. I'm really looking 
forward to this season with (car owner) Steve Horne and the Tasman team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indy Lights season will open April 10 at Phoenix International Raceway in 
conjunction with the Indy car race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny about cycles and cars," he said. "You use the same principals, but 
there are still some radical differences. The one I notice most is that I can't 
move the car around with my body, like I do with the bike. Body movement can 
compensate for handling problems on a bike, but moving your body in the car 
doesn't do much. You've got to have it right before you take off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another thing is the difference in how deep you can take your equipment into 
a corner before braking. You can really go deep on a bike, but you wouldn't 
believe how deep you can go in an Indy Lights car. As an example, on a bike you 
might go to the 300-foot marker and touch the brakes, while in an Indy Lights 
car you go past the 100 marker and just brush them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of getting your brain to readjust to the different check 
points." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson still has a home in Upland, where he was raised, but he spends most of 
his off-track time at Lake Havasu, Nev., where he keeps a boat for cruising on 
the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 MOTORCYCLES -- World speedway champion Sam Ermolenko, recuperating from a 
broken leg and bruised back, showed he is about ready to race again when he 
defeated former national champions Mike Faria and Brad Oxley in a match race 
during last week's Spring Classic at Costa Mesa. Ermolenko will return to the 
British League later this month. The weekly Friday night season at the Orange 
County Fairgrounds will start April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Blythe Speedway will open its third season as an asphalt track 
Saturday night with sportsman, pro stocks and hobby stocks, plus an MSRA 
pro-four touring series race. . . . Sportsman, pro stocks and factory stocks 
will race Saturday night at Imperial Raceway as part of the California 
Mid-Winter Fair.

COVER STORY: RIDING HIGH ON REPUTATION; CUSTOM SADDLE MAKERS IN DEMAND FOR 
THEIR EXPERTISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Caedimenphobia is the name psychologists use to describe the fear some people 
have that parts of their bodies will become permanently bonded with Super Glue. 
</P>
<P>
 The space-age adhesive is on the mind of Steve Gonzalez, a saddle maker from 
Ojai, as he lists the injuries that can happen to those who craft saddles by 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Razor-sharp knives cheerfully flay even the most callused hand. Needle-fine 
awls effortlessly run through reckless palms, and the heavy-duty sewing machine 
can lace a careless fingernail -- zip -- just like that. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most common injury is a repetitive one that comes from drawing tight 
the threads stitched by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thread bites into your fingers and splits your skin," Gonzalez said. 
"Splits it right in the joints where you can't put a bandage on it. This is the 
only thing that works," he said, producing a tube of super adhesive. "I glue 
the cuts together. This stuff is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Who'd have thought it? Caedimenphilia.  
</P>
<P>
 While daubing industrial adhesive in open wounds is odd by most standards, 
it's a fair example of the extent to which Ventura County's handful of custom 
saddle makers will go in their quest to build the best in equine equipage. 
</P>
<P>
 Their creations aren't the silver bedecked things you see in the Rose Parade. 
What Ventura County produces are rock-solid designs built for granite-hard 
horsemen. Customers include endurance riders who compete in races that last for 
days and the handful of remaining cowboys who spend years working cattle.

 "I make saddles for buckaroos," Oak View saddle maker David Brannan said. 
"Guys who still make their living earning $800 a month punching cows, if you 
can call that a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Brannan was a sheriff's deputy in Ventura County for 12 years before he 
started building saddles two years ago. Like three of the four saddle makers in 
Ventura County, Brannan started the craft after working in other fields. 
</P>
<P>
 George Randall of Ojai is the exception. His field has always been the cow 
pasture. Randall, who is 81, started punching cattle at 16, when he drove 200 
head up from Ventura over the trail that is now Highway 33 and into the Cuyama 
Valley. Since then he has raised cattle in six California counties, all over 
Arizona and some of Mexico, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "As near as I know, I'm the only saddle maker who rode horses for a living," 
Randall said. "That's why cowboys like my saddles." 
</P>
<P>
 A Randall saddle is plain as sand and made for the gritty task of roping 
cattle. Period. 
</P>
<P>
 It features a stout saddle horn, a generous cantle and wide, wide stirrups. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall explains the stirrups this way: "If you were going to stand on a 
1-by-6 board all day, which way would you turn it?" 
</P>
<P>
 One guy who does spend all day with his foot in the stirrup is Fred Reyes, 60, 
a Cuyama Valley rancher. It's not unusual for Reyes to spend eight hours or 
more each day overseeing 300 head of cattle, all of it done from the seat of a 
Randall saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while there, I was getting a saddle every year or two 'cause they 
weren't right, but I've had this Randall saddle for about five years," Reyes 
said, "and it's doin' just fine. I've probably sold a half dozen of his saddles 
to cowboys around here." 
</P>
<P>
 At two to three times the cost of production saddles, custom models are for 
those who can tell the difference. Reyes said it's not unusual for a cowboy 
earning $1,000 a month to spend $2,000 to $3,000 on a saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes provides a simple explanation involving what anatomists refer to as the 
coccyx and posterior tuberosity of the ischium, collectively referred to in the 
vernacular as The Butt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless the seat is narrow enough in front, your hips get tired," Reyes said. 
That's when you start walking like a cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
 Accommodating distinctive tuberosities takes David Brannan as much as three 
hours. He starts by applying six layers of leather to the seat of the saddle 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I have the customer sit on it for an hour or so while I carve it to fit 
with a draw knife." 
</P>
<P>
 The attention lavished on the seat is, in part, a tribute to its role in the 
evolution of what we recognize as the western saddle, according to a 
Smithsonian survey of early American saddles titled "Man Made Mobile." 
</P>
<P>
 Settlers from the Atlantic Coast rode west on English-style saddles, effete 
designs ill-suited for the rigors of the frontier. They soon learned that a 
deeper seat provided more stability for the rider crossing uneven terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat, along with the high front fork, comprised the enduring Hollywood 
image of a sturdy saddle trussed to a tireless steed. But oddly enough, the 
icon that's so evocative of the American West was a Mexican invention. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the saddle horn was a Mexican import. 
</P>
<P>
 The horn evolved as Spanish settlers raising cattle in Mexico found they 
needed a way to rope and brand cattle on the open range. They developed a 
strictly utilitarian saddle with a rugged horn to dally the lariat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smithsonian reported that the U.S. Army adopted the design and swiftly 
applied it to great effect in the Mexican-American War. The resultant land grab 
opened up the Southwest to an increased number of settlers who further 
diversified the vaquero design, thereby contributing a sort of synergy to the 
western saddle's evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1880s cowboys as far north as the Great Plains had already established 
a style of saddle all their own, said Moorpark saddle maker Walter McCurdy. 
Although these saddles were unique, they bore the unmistakable influence of 
saddles developed on Mexican haciendas 2,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The next direction in saddle construction was again initiated by the Army 
when, in 1855, it adopted the design proposed by a cavalry captain named 
McClellan. The lightweight, durable McClellan remained standard issue until 
World War II, and it's still the design from which Ojai saddle maker Steve 
Gonzalez draws his inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez uses traditional ingredients of French bridle leather, European pine 
pitch and bee's wax, as well as synthetics like Dacron, neoprene and fiberglass 
to produce remarkably lightweight saddles for endurance riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of our saddles are for people who ride their horses as much as 
100 miles in a day," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands of the event means it's just as important that the saddle fit the 
horse as the rider. So Gonzalez starts with a plaster cast of the horse's back 
and builds a fiberglass tree that uniquely fits that animal. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of innovation and attention led to a patent and the respect of other 
saddle makers, who call Gonzalez a genius. People mail the plaster casts to him 
from as far away as Australia. Three of the entrants at the world endurance 
championship in Holland this fall will be mounted on Gonzalez saddles. 
</P>
<P>
 The only local horse wearing a Gonzalez saddle is owned by Wilma Melville, 60, 
of Ojai, who competes in races such as the "Capitol To Capitol" which stretches 
between Carson City, Nev. and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's five days at a brisk trot," Melville said, "some cantering." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Melville said she has a saddle by a well-known maker, her horse 
develops a sore spot near the withers. So she decided to try one of Gonzalez's 
designs. She liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 At $1,600 for the base model, it's not a cheap experiment. Custom saddles are 
in general an expensive proposition. Can there be that much demand? 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," McCurdy said. "People say to me, 'I'll bet you don't want 
another saddle maker moving in.' I say I wish one would. Might take some of the 
pressure off." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy said with more than 150 training barns around Moorpark alone, he's had 
to refer people to other saddle makers. In the first six months of business his 
gross revenues were $36,000. 
</P>

DUCKS LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS TO SCORING DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troy Loney stood in the center of the Mighty Duck dressing room, rubbing his 
chin while pondering a question. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a moment to search the memory banks of his 11 NHL seasons, but he had 
the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think three," he said. "Two a couple of times, but not three." 
</P>
<P>
 Loney wasn't the only one searching for answers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks established a dubious first, extending to 188 minutes 23 seconds -- 
more than three full games -- their scoreless streak. This time the Buffalo 
Sabres and goaltender Dominik Hasek pinned a shutout on the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, the 3-0 score means the Ducks have been outscored, 12-0, in 
losses to San Jose on Sunday, Chicago on Tuesday and Buffalo on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Arturs Irbe, Ed Belfour and Hasek are tough goalies to beat, but 
the Ducks wouldn't pin their offensive woes on anyone but themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't just flick a switch and change things," said Todd Ewen, who probably 
wishes he could. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks haven't scored since the third period of a 6-3 victory over the 
last-place Edmonton Oilers Friday. The honor went to Joe Sacco, whose 
power-play goal proved to be the the game clincher. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Friday, the Ducks have fired 80 shots at opposing goalies and come away 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating right now," Sacco said. "We're in a little bit of a 
drought right now. We've played well, but not quite good enough. We've got to 
stay positive. It's easy to get down. When you lose three in a row, you start 
shaking your head." 
</P>
<P>
 No one cracked a stick over the boards at the final buzzer. No one chucked 
equipment around the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice, the Ducks might simply be trying too hard, according to Ewen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely pressing in the corners," he said. "We're getting caught 
with three guys behind the net. We've got to change that, get guys back where 
they're supposed to be and stick to defensive hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first goal we get isn't going to be a pretty goal. It won't be 
tic-tac-toe top shelf. It'll probably be ugly, off somebody's butt and into the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way (to score) is to shoot as often as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' playoff aspirations are probably history now, but there remains 
much to be accomplished. For starters, they need to take each part of their 
next game and master it, hoping all the little things lead to something good. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's Ewen's theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to go out and win the next game, work hard on the next shift," he 
said. "Our defensive game is very important. It's baby steps all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Loney, the team's captain, has noticed only one change and it's not a good 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all frustrated," he said. "It wears on you. We have to stay in the 
positive frame of mind. We can't just let it knock us out of the playoffs."

SETTLEMENT MAY BE NEAR IN JAPAN TRADE DISPUTE; POLICY: PROGRESS ON CELLULAR 
PHONE TALKS REPORTED. PACT COULD HEAD OFF U.S. SANCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiators for two companies at the center of a bitter dispute over access to 
Japan's cellular telephone market are close to a settlement that could head off 
threatened U.S. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has started a process that will allow it to impose 
several hundred million dollars' worth of sanctions on Japanese exports to the 
United States for what it views as Japan's failure to live up to the terms of a 
1989 market-opening agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute, which involves Motorola Inc. and Japan's Nippon Idou Tsushin 
Corp. (IDO), is just one of several contentious trade issues over which 
Washington has raised the possibility of retaliatory action against Japan for 
maintaining obstacles to foreign imports. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is much progress, but we have not yet achieved an official settlement," 
Shinji Kimura, a spokesman for Nippon Motorola Ltd., said today. "We will still 
need a little bit more negotiation with IDO." 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides have roughly agreed on a plan under which IDO would build 159 
additional relay stations by March, 1996, to expand services for Motorola-type 
phones in the populous 155-mile corridor from Tokyo to Nagoya, the Japan 
Broadcasting Corp. reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the United States 
is pleased with the positive trend in the talks, but he stopped short of easing 
the threat of sanctions. Washington will want Tokyo to ensure that any eventual 
final agreement is fully honored by IDO, he said. The Japanese government must 
ensure "that they are going to stand behind it and make sure that it is carried 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As portrayed by the Clinton Administration, the case typifies problems that 
foreign companies face in trying to enter the lucrative but highly regulated 
Japanese market. Motorola, backed by the U.S. government, has charged that 
Japan has maintained obstacles to its becoming competitive with its cellular 
phone service in the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor.  
</P>
<P>
 Motorola says it has about 49% of the market in the seaport city of Osaka, 
where it has not faced similar obstacles, but has only 12,900 subscribers in 
the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor. Japanese systems using different technology, 
marketed by IDO and Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., have about 1.2 million 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from the United States, Japan agreed in 1989 to assign some 
frequencies in the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor to the Motorola-style cellular phone 
system and to require IDO to construct the transmitters required for the system 
to work. In effect, IDO was required to provide the infrastructure for two 
competing systems -- one using NTT technology and the other using Motorola's. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. complaint basically is that too much emphasis was put on the NTT 
system and not enough on Motorola's. 
</P>
<P>
 IDO has constructed 190 relay stations for the Motorola system, but more are 
needed for Motorola phones to provide full service in this area. The current 
dispute centers on how many more stations IDO will build, when they will be 
built and whether allocated frequencies will be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola's Kimura said today's news reports reflect tentative agreements on 
the relay stations issues but that it is impossible to have a final agreement 
in any sector until an overall agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations are now focused on Motorola's request for a more even allocation 
of frequencies between the NTT and Motorola systems, Kimura said.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: THE MYTH OF A 'COMPETITIVE' ECONOMIC POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An American economy that cares a great deal about boosting domestic 
productivity requires policy-makers who care very little about global 
competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 A Zen koan for the nationalistic '90s? The sound of one Keynesian clapping? A 
lyric for aspiring autarkists? 
</P>
<P>
 None on the above. It's the startling pronouncement of MIT's Paul Krugman, one 
of the country's most brilliant young economists, a nonpartisan academic with a 
reputation for intellectual honesty and a cruel tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 You might recall that Krugman was widely quoted criticizing industrial-policy 
economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson's research when President Clinton named her 
chairwoman of his Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternating between statistical scalpels and macroeconomic machetes, Krugman 
bloodily eviscerates "competitiveness" as a policy doctrine without any kind of 
economic validity. 
</P>
<P>
 What supply-side "economics" was to Reaganomics, Krugman asserts, 
competitiveness has become to Clintonomics: a sort of psuedo-rational pastiche 
that Nobel Prize-winning chemist Irving Langmuir once described as 
"pathological science" -- that is to say, no science at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "To make a harsh but not entirely unjustified analogy," he says in his essay 
"Competitiveness: A Dangerous Obsession" in the current issue of Foreign 
Affairs, "a government wedded to the ideology of competitiveness is as unlikely 
to make good economic policy as a government committed to creationism is to 
make good science policy, even in areas that have no direct relationship to the 
theory of evolution." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gee, we must be making progress," smiles Dan Burton, president of the Council 
of (sigh) Competitiveness, which was formed by frustrated high-tech executives 
in the wake of the Ronald Reagan Administration's rejection of its own 
presidential commission on the topic. "In 1987, competitiveness was dismissed 
as a buzzword. Today, it's graduated to being a dangerous obsession." 
</P>
<P>
 Might Krugman be the one with the dangerous obsession? Not after you see the 
numbers. His arguments would command respect even without his impeccable 
credentials. They're important because he takes the global competitiveness 
champions like Tyson, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, Labor Secretary 
Robert B. Reich and health care guru Ira Magaziner on their own terms, 
impatiently redoes their arithmetic for them and makes a strong case that 
competitiveness issues amount to little more than a rounding error in the 
$6-trillion U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dead end of a type we've seen before," says Krugman, who is comparably 
harsh in his assessments of Reagan's supply-siders and former British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher's monetarists. "You take something with a grain of 
truth and some people seize on it. . . . Here, some characters have taken small 
conflicts of interest between countries and decided to build an economic policy 
around them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But why do so many hardheaded business people find "competitiveness" so 
alluring? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because people generalize from their own experience," Krugman asserts. "The 
experience that a CEO gets is one of global competition, but even the CEO of a 
large multinational has a worm's-eye view of world trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Krugman takes no economic prisoners. He apologizes for what he says was an 
out-of-context quote criticizing Tyson in the New York Times and in the next 
breath statistically demolishes a competitiveness argument Tyson recently put 
forward in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laura Tyson had an article about expanding the Japanese market for American 
goods," recounts Krugman, "so that we'd have not just more jobs but better 
jobs. She said, at best, we could sell another $20 billion annually. Now, let's 
suppose all of these new jobs are high-tech. We know that average value-added 
for these jobs is about $80,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 With that volume of trade, we're talking about creating 250,000 high-tech jobs 
(as opposed to non-high-tech jobs). In essence, we're talking about giving 
250,000 people an extra $6,000 a year. That's just over $1.5 billion a year. A 
billion and a half dollars a year is 1/40th of a percent of GNP. 
</P>
<P>
 "So," Krugman concludes, "if we get everything we want from trade in Japan, we 
will get an increase of 1/40th of 1% in our national income. Now, suppose I'm 
wrong at each stage of my calculation by a factor of 2. We're still only 
talking about one-tenth of 1% of GNP. Is that what we really want in our 
relationship with Japan? What's so shocking about 'competitiveness' is, when 
you go beyond the rhetoric and see what's at stake, you find the stakes are 
absurdly low." 
</P>
<P>
 The clear policy implication? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should talk about the productivity of the whole U.S. economy," 
says Krugman, "not just the parts of the economy that happen to be in 
competition with foreign rivals." This Administration's focus on global 
competitiveness, he fears, is undermining the far more vital issue of 
stimulating productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where I disagree with Paul Krugman is that the international reference point 
is really important," maintains the Competitiveness Council's Burton. "To 
ignore the impact of the quality movement, the push toward lean manufacturing 
and reduced cycle times is to underestimate competitiveness' profound impact on 
American business. . . . Reducing it to numbers is to miss the point. Adjusting 
to world markets is how a lot of American enterprises are getting organized." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Krugman's analyses of competitiveness do not address the underlying 
dynamics of innovation, evolving business practices or the changing culture of 
economic enterprises. He is simply looking at the outputs based on rigorous 
econometric analysis. In fact, he freely acknowledges that the social forces 
underlying productivity may well be far more important than any economic policy 
he and his brethren might devise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fascinating," says Krugman. "I believe that sociology is more important 
than economics. I just don't know how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 So, in the wake of Krugman's unambiguous numbers, expect the competitiveness 
debate in the 1990s to shift from the economic battlefield to the social 
battlefield. A White House Council of Sociological Advisers, anyone?

 When an electronics retailer placed splash guards bearing a competitor's logo 
in the urinals of its stores, the competitor decided to take the dispute out of 
the bathroom and into the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wiz claimed in a U.S. District Court lawsuit that the Edison, N.J.-based 
Tops Appliance City chain "embarked on actions intended to denigrate, 
disparage, dilute and place in disrepute" the Wiz logo by "prominently" 
displaying it for people "urinating into the urinal and onto the urinal splash 
guards" at Tops stores in the New York metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wiz said it wrote to Tops management asking that its name be removed from 
the urinals, noting the "tastelessness and unprofessionalism of such a 
gesture." No reply came, and the suit was filed. But a lawyer for Tops said 
that "we're pretty close" to reaching a settlement in the case.

 After months of negotiations, Northrop made an offer of at least $50 a share 
last month, Grumman said in a filing with the SEC. However, Grumman turned 
aside the Northrop bid in favor of a $55-a-share offer from Martin Marietta, a 
deal that was announced earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Los Angeles, Northrop is at a critical juncture in its venerable 
history, which includes development of the F-5 jet fighter, the T-38 Air Force 
trainer and the B-2 stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts believe Northrop itself is a candidate to be acquired if it does not 
succeed in acquisitions of its own. Northrop knows that, and at least three 
times in recent years it has tried but failed to buy a major defense operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Grumman, Northrop said it might be willing to pay more than $50 
a share, the SEC filing said. But analysts doubt that Northrop will raise the 
stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa is adamant about not paying too much for an 
acquisition, they noted, and unwelcome takeovers are rare in the defense 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Kresa is the kind of person who would go for a hostile bid," 
said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at the consulting firm JSA Research Inc. in 
Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Grumman's stock climbed as high as $55.25 a share Wednesday before 
closing at $55, up 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading, indicating 
that at least some investors expect a higher bid -- from Northrop or some other 
suitor. Northrop's stock, meanwhile, slipped 50 cents to $40.625 a share, also 
on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon is encouraging the industry's consolidation as the best response 
to the nation's shrinking defense budgets, which means the Defense Department 
might not object to a takeover fight for Grumman, said Wolfgang Demisch of BT 
Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Northrop declined to comment on its plans, the company remains under 
pressure to complete a merger quickly or risk becoming an also-ran in the 
winnowing defense field and an inviting asset for one of its bigger rivals to 
buy, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're in danger of becoming a target," said Gary J. Reich of Prudential 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is Northrop's dilemma: The consolidation swirling around the company is 
fast leaving the industry dominated by a handful of giant firms with annual 
sales of $10 billion or more each. The titans include Martin, McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. and Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop's sales were $5.1 billion last year. Moreover, its sales are expected 
to drop by about a third in coming years unless the company buys something or 
wins a major new award. 
</P>
<P>
 Its leading program, the B-2, is scheduled to end in the late 1990s when the 
company finishes building the 20 bombers ordered by the Air Force. Northrop has 
said the program's end could cut its annual sales to between $3 billion and $4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also makes missiles, defense electronics and parts for McDonnell's 
F/A-18 jet fighter and Boeing's 747 passenger jet. 
</P>
<P>
 While failing to make a major acquisition, Northrop has made solid financial 
progress in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although its 1993 profit fell to $96 million from $121 million the previous 
year, owing to losses on the development of a new stealth missile, Northrop has 
been generating enough cash to reduce its long-term debt to $160 million from 
$690 million three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has slashed its work force to 29,000 from 48,000 six years ago and 
taken other cost-cutting steps. And it expects to keep generating large amounts 
of cash that could help finance a merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa, 55, has previously said he won't be pressured into launching a merger 
that doesn't make "strategic sense." He's also said that if Northrop can't find 
a sound deal, it is willing to become a smaller company and return its excess 
cash to stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, Northrop has clearly been looking to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 It tried to buy IBM's Federal Systems division earlier this year but was 
outbid by Loral Corp.'s $1.5-billion offer. It also sought General Dynamics' 
F-16 fighter jet line, but Lockheed won that derby a year ago with a 
$1.5-billion bid. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Northrop may itself be willing to be swallowed up -- but only if 
the price is right. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone wants to make his (Kresa's) shareholders rich at a fair price, I 
think the man has the intestinal fortitude that he will accept," analyst 
Demisch said. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Prudential's Reich, Northrop won't be acquired simply because 
it is becoming a secondary player and is ripe for picking. Any suitor will want 
Northrop's operations to complement its own, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody has to feel that two plus two equals five," Reich said.

BARRIERS STILL PERSIST, WOMEN LAWYERS SAY; WORKPLACE: DESPITE GAINS IN RECENT 
YEARS, STUDY FINDS MEN STILL HAVE INSIDE TRACK TO PARTNERSHIP STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Los Angeles law firms are opening their doors wider to women lawyers these 
days, but many continue to shut them out of areas critical to achieving senior 
partner rank and equal financial rewards, according to a study released 
Wednesday by the Women Lawyers Assn. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite women's significant advances in the last decade, the study concludes, 
law largely continues to be an "old boys' club." 
</P>
<P>
 "Women have made a lot of progress, especially in clear issues such as 
part-time work and maternity leave policies and in areas of sexual harassment," 
said Kim McLane Wardlaw, president of the organization and a partner at 
O'Melveny & Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's a cup half-empty, half-full. . . . The survey shows that women are 
increasingly welcomed as 'minders' and 'grinders,' but not as 'finders,' " she 
said -- which means women are doing routine tasks and "grunt" work but not 
generating new business and clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the finders are the ones who have the most power, prestige and 
standing in the profession, so we're still behind in obtaining this power," 
Wardlaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One primary roadblock, according to this survey and others, is exclusion from 
formal and informal settings designed to bring in new clients and sharpen 
so-called rainmaking skills. Another is the lack of mentors within law firms or 
government agencies that could help women learn the ropes of legal practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two areas are increasingly critical today in achieving partner or senior 
manager rank within law firms and agencies, said Cory M. Amron, a Washington 
attorney who chairs the American Bar Assn.'s Commission on Women in the 
Profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nationally, client development -- especially in these economic times -- has 
become absolutely crucial," she said. "Where once you could be just a good 
lawyer and progress within your firm, today there is an inordinate emphasis 
placed on the clients you can bring to the firm. The firms see that as their 
lifeblood." 
</P>
<P>
 Amron agreed with many in the Los Angeles survey who said that female 
attorneys are at a great disadvantage compared to their male colleagues, who 
network with clients and each other and develop a business base in typically 
men-only settings. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior women say they are also less likely to be mentored by senior attorneys, 
because there are too few senior female lawyers -- and the senior men most 
often mentor other men. 
</P>
<P>
 Women in 1993 made up 41% of associates -- or junior staff members -- and 15% 
of partners at Los Angeles-area law firms of 20 or more lawyers. That was up 
from 25% of associates and 4% of partners a decade ago, according to 
preliminary figures gathered by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 427 lawyers who responded to the survey, 73% said women and men have an 
equal chance of being hired at their law firms, corporate legal departments or 
governmental agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the survey said, once inside, women find subtle barriers based on 
gender; only 10% said gender bias from colleagues was no problem, while 32% 
said it was either a "large" or "pervasive" problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, while 63% said in the survey that they are able to balance family and 
career, in comments they generally defined "balance" as sacrificing either 
partnership potential or quality family life. Although law firm policies on 
part-time work and parental leave have loosened considerably in the past 
decade, many female lawyers say their careers suffer when they choose to have 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all women, however, find these problems insurmountable to success or even 
happiness; 83% of the respondents said they were satisfied with the level of 
responsibility they have been given. More than half (53%) said women in their 
companies or agencies have equal opportunity with men for administrative and 
management roles. And 54% said they were either reasonably or very satisfied 
with their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comments by those surveyed offered an often astonishing look at the enduring 
gender bias inside law firms today. 
</P>
<P>
 Some firms have no female partners at all. One woman reported that while 13 of 
the 18 lawyers in her firm are women, all of the bosses are men. Others said 
women routinely were not included in, or even told about, firm social 
functions, such as golf outings. Another was told she was "too attractive" to 
be mentored by a senior male attorney; others found their commitment to their 
jobs challenged -- or their significant case work disappear -- once they became 
pregnant. L.A. Law: The Women's View 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by the Women Lawyers Assn. of Los Angeles found that the area's 
female attorneys generally are satisfied with the responsibilities they are 
granted by their firms but continue to feel that the advancement of women 
lawyers in general is held back by their gender. Some of the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 "Women lawyers receive less desirable case assignments/transactions/work." 
Strongly agree: 11% Somewhat agree: 49% Somewhat disagree: 27% Strongly 
disagree: 13% 
</P>
<P>
 "Women lawyers are held to a higher standard of performance than men." 
Strongly agree: 29% Somewhat agree: 45% Somewhat disagree: 18% Strongly 
disagree: 8% 
</P>
<P>
 Note: The survey was mailed to 1,100 members of the association throughout Los 
Angeles County, who were asked to pass it along to fellow women lawyers. About 
65% of the 427 women who responded are members of the group.

APPLE'S NEW CROP; COMPUTER MAKER IS STAKING ITS FUTURE ON POWERPC MODELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apple Computer Inc.'s launch next Monday of a new line of Macintoshes using 
the nimble PowerPC chip will put the company on the threshold of a dream -- or 
a marketing disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The move marks a treacherous turning point for the maker of the venerable Mac, 
now more than a decade old and showing signs of wear. To salvage its tarnished 
image as a leading-edge personal computer company, industry observers say, 
Apple needs a high-powered winner on which to stake its future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apple really understands how important this is," said Ken Krich, president of 
ComputerWare, a Bay Area computer retailer that carries only Apple products. 
"If they foul it up, they're history." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Apple's new Power Macs have been winning a fair number of accolades 
from trade reviewers. But whether Apple can translate critical acclaim into 
robust sales is far from clear, analysts say. What is obvious is that the 
company has set itself some formidable tasks fraught with opportunities for 
bungling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silicon Valley champion of user-friendly equipment must woo customers and 
software developers to an entirely new technology without trashing sales of 
older Mac models scheduled to be phased out over the next three years. It must 
also keep current Mac devotees happy while somehow luring converts from 
machines that run Microsoft's Windows and MS-DOS software -- in other words, 
the overwhelming majority of PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by more than the usual hype, the Power Mac machines will vie with 
similarly powerful -- but more expensive -- rivals featuring Pentium chips from 
Intel Corp., the global leader in semiconductors. By industry estimates, Intel 
chips supply the "brains" for at least 80% of the estimated 125 million 
computers in use worldwide. Users of Macintosh machines, which run on Motorola 
microprocessors, number about 11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The PowerPC has some advantages over Pentium: It consumes less power, making 
it ideal for portables, the hottest growth market. And early trade feedback 
indicates that the machines offer the muscular performance needed for emerging 
technologies requiring voice recognition, 3-D modeling and the manipulation of 
video, sound and graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 A chief disadvantage is that a rich lode of software designed specifically for 
the PowerPC to make best use of its speed won't be available for months or even 
years. Only between 50 and 100 such software titles will be ready at 
introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a trove of software, persuading users to trade up from the current 
Macs or switch from the Intel-Windows environment could prove daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be difficult for them to expand market share tremendously," 
said Linley Gwennap, editor of Microprocessor Report, a trade newsletter based 
in Sebastopol, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Apple executives in Cupertino are boldly predicting that they 
will do just that. Ian W. Diery, Apple's executive vice president of worldwide 
sales and marketing, plans on a jump of five percentage points over three to 
five years, from Apple's current global share of 10% or so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're betting the ranch, as they say in America, on this transition," said 
the Australia-born Diery. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Apple won't say how much its new machines will cost, scuttlebutt puts 
them at a competitive $2,000 to $5,000 -- a rare chance for Apple to be a price 
leader, said Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with the Hambrecht & Quist investment 
firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparable Pentium machines, now selling for about $3,000, will probably drop 
to $2,000 by year-end, thanks to price cuts by Intel. 
</P>
<P>
 To further counter any perceived edge for Apple, Intel on Monday unveiled far 
faster versions of the Pentium and has geared up a splashy ad campaign 
capitalizing on its familiar "Intel inside" theme. Computer makers such as 
Hewlett-Packard, AST Research and Gateway 2000 say they plan to ship PCs using 
a souped-up Intel chip as early as next month, priced from $3,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way, consumers can expect to see new generations of Pentium and 
PowerPC chips playing leapfrog for months to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Such competition "keeps us on our toes," said Curt Nichols, marketing director 
for Intel's Pentium processor division. 
</P>
<P>
 For Apple -- which last year endured 2,500 disheartening layoffs, the ouster 
of Chairman John F. Sculley and the botched debut of its Newton hand-held 
computer -- the Power Macintoshes are providing a much needed morale lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "PowerPC is one of the few lights at the end of the tunnel keeping people 
pretty excited," said Kenneth Lim, who resigned in January as Apple's chief 
futurist to start an interactive-media consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The PowerPC microprocessor is the product of a groundbreaking alliance, 
announced three years ago, among IBM, Motorola and Apple. It represents Intel's 
first significant competition in years, most analysts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 The chips feature reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, which is Silicon 
Valley-ese for a technology that boosts processing speed by giving the computer 
fewer and simpler instructions. The PowerPC's greater simplicity and smaller 
size make it cheaper to manufacture than Intel's chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple's Power Mac design team worked hard to ensure the loyalty of Macintosh 
users. Packages to help Mac users upgrade to PowerPC capabilities will be 
plentiful. And tests by Apple and outsiders indicate that 93% to 98% of 
existing Mac software will run flawlessly on the new machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a huge relief," said James S. Gable, Apple's product line manager for 
the PowerPC. "It will make it easy for people to switch over." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the generally favorable publicity about PowerPC, investor enthusiasm 
has seemed elusive. Apple shares closed Wednesday at $37.50 in Nasdaq trading, 
down from about $60 last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Apple fans fear the company will have trouble living up to the 
expectations it has created. And few expect it to make much headway in 
corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, everyone agrees that Apple's fate hinges on a smooth transition. 
Said Mark Hall, editor of MacWeek magazine in San Francisco: "Apple's 
reputation as a high-tech leader will rest on the success of the PowerPC."

 MGM Grand to Buy Back Shares: The company said it plans to buy back as many as 
1 million shares of its common stock to take advantage of low prices. MGM 
Grand, which is owned primarily by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, said it will 
purchase the shares with cash over an as-yet-undetermined period. MGM also said 
its principal shareholder, Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp., may buy more MGM shares 
over time.

 USAir Seeks $1.5 Billion in Worker Concessions: The Arlington, Va.-based 
carrier is asking employees for wage and work-rule concessions of $500 million 
a year over three years as part of its effort to sharply curtail labor costs, 
according to sources familiar with the company's plans.USAir Group announced 
Monday that it expects to lose more than $200 million in the first quarter of 
1994 due to a combination of bad weather and intense competition from low-fare 
carriers such as Southwest Airlines and Continental Airlines' CALite. At the 
same time, British Airways announced that it was suspending an agreement to 
invest more money in USAir.

 Kellogg Teams With ConAgra: Kellogg Co., the nation's largest cereal maker, 
and ConAgra Inc., the second-biggest food processor, joined forces to scoop up 
a share of the breakfast market for health-conscious consumers.Starting this 
summer, Battle Creek, Mich.-based Kellogg will introduce multi-grain, 
ready-to-eat cereals under ConAgra's Healthy Choice brand name. It is the first 
such licensing deal for Kellogg and the first time that Omaha, Neb.-based 
ConAgra has let an outsider use the Healthy Choice name since launching the 
brand six years ago. ConAgra gets the advantage of Kellogg's skills at 
marketing breakfast food. Other than egg substitutes, the Healthy Choice 
product lineup has failed to feature breakfast items.

EXECUTIVE LIFE SUCCESSOR KEEPS 92% OF BUSINESS; INSURANCE: GARAMENDI CALLS 
FIGURE 'A TREMENDOUS VOTE OF CONFIDENCE' -- BUT SOME POLICYHOLDERS ARE LESS 
THAN HAPPY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wide majority of policyholders of the failed Executive Life Insurance Co. 
have opted to remain with the insurer's successor firm, a result that state 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi on Wednesday called "a tremendous vote of 
confidence" in his rehabilitation plan for Executive Life, which he seized as 
insolvent in April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a number of policyholders are disgruntled with the way the plan 
treats them and say that Garamendi and officials of Aurora National Life 
Assurance Co. -- Executive Life's successor -- continue to overstate the share 
of their original investments that they will ultimately recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also complain that Aurora failed to provide enough accurate and timely 
information to enable policyholders to make an informed decision about whether 
to "opt in" to the rehabilitation plan -- that is, stick with Aurora -- or "opt 
out" and accept a reduced but immediate cash settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Life's 337,000 policyholders faced that choice during a two-month 
election period that ended Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi announced Wednesday that about 310,000 policyholders, or 92%, opted 
in. In dollar terms, accounts worth $4.52 billion, or 69% of the total, opted 
in, while $2.02 billion, or 31%, opted out. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the "opt-outs" represented $1.2 billion worth of guaranteed 
investment contracts whose trustees have battled Garamendi in court from the 
outset and still have legal appeals pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Life was carrying a huge junk bond portfolio in a weak market when 
Garamendi seized it. He has been strenuously second-guessed for that decision, 
most recently in a Forbes magazine cover story this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes said Garamendi erred by overreacting to the jumpy market and seizing 
Executive Life in the first place. He then compounded the error, the magazine 
said, by selling off the entire junk bond portfolio at a price -- $3.25 billion 
-- far below what could have been garnered had the bonds been sold gradually 
and in smaller lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, a Democrat who is running for governor, has defended his actions as 
prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 Other complaints that surfaced during the opt-in/opt-out election concern the 
information Aurora provided its policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Weinberg, an Encino insurance broker who represents several hundred 
Executive Life policyholders, said Wednesday that Aurora gave him and other 
brokers misleading and incomplete information that led them to advise some 
customers to opt in. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aurora later provided accurate information, several customers realized 
they had made the wrong choice, Weinberg said. But when they tried to reverse 
their election choices before the Feb. 12 deadline, they were refused, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Baum, Garamendi's chief deputy, said Wednesday that policyholders had 
been told that their decisions were irrevocable.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market bounced back from early losses to close mostly higher, 
helped by a calm bond market. Auto and technology shares led the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest rates finished modestly lower after the Federal Reserve Board's 
periodic commentary on the economy indicated few signs of accelerating 
inflation. In the muni market, California sold $700 million in new bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar rose against the Japanese yen, buoyed by new hopes for possible 
easing of U.S.-Japanese trade frictions. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 After languishing much of the day as the bond market remained on edge, stocks 
rallied toward the session's close. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 1.69 points to 3,853.41. Although 
losers narrowly outnumbered winners on the New York Stock Exchange, most 
broader stock indexes also closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow was off nearly 20 points early in the day as bond yields rose. But the 
bond market's tone improved later, as traders took a closer look at the Fed's 
so-called beige book report on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The beige book, which shows how the economy is faring by region, indicated 
that growth is on a moderate course with few signs of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of inflation has pushed bond yields sharply higher in recent weeks. The 
Fed raised short-term interest rates Feb. 4 in an effort to slow the economy, 
and many investors have been expecting it to boost rates again soon. But the 
beige book suggested the Fed need not act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "the consensus is that while we may not have to go any higher in 
(interest) rates right away, the perception certainly is that we're not going 
any lower," said Ned Collins, head block trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks led the market after the semiconductor industry reported 
continuing strong orders in February. The Nasdaq industrial index, heavy with 
tech shares, rose 2.11 points to 840.50, just below its all-time high of 
841.47. 
</P>
<P>
 Among semiconductor issues, Intel rose 7/8 to 71 5/8, Texas Instruments gained 
1 1/2 to 84 1/4, Micron Technology rose 3 to 80 3/8 and Motorola added 2 at 108 
3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks renewed their advance. Ford leaped 1 5/8 to 65 3/8, Chrysler 
gained 1 1/4 to 60 7/8 and GM added 5/8 to 62 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks were strong. Warner Lambert rose 1 1/8 to 64 1/2, 
Schering-Plough gained 1 1/4 to 59 7/8, Merck inched up 5/8 to 32 3/8 and Amgen 
was up 3/4 to 41 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the health care group, hospital giant National Medical Enterprises 
continued its rebound, rising 3/4 to 17 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, paper stocks fell after International Paper told analysts 
they should lower their first-quarter earnings estimates because of severe 
weather and low prices on printing papers. IP fell 2 3/4 to 71 1/2, Georgia 
Pacific lost 1 3/4 to close at 70 and Stone Container eased 3/8 to 15 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Instrument tumbled 2 5/8 to 45 1/2. The New York Times reported the 
company is being investigated by the Justice Department for possible antitrust 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets were weak. Tokyo's Nikkei average lost 59.21 points to 
19,839.18, while Frankfurt's DAX index eased 7.95 points to 2,116.09 and 
London's FTSE-100 fell 17.7 points to 3,246.7. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index had another bad day, losing 38.33 points to 
2,533.08 as short-term interest rates edged up. NYSE-listed Telmex fell 1 7/8 
to 65 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's key stock market index dove roughly 5% after an investigation into 
stock manipulations widened to include officials of one of the country's major 
banks. Other Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates eased across the board, aided by the Fed beige book's comments 
on low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds slipped to 6.83% from 6.87% on Tuesday, 
and shorter-term yields also fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's relative calm helped California, which sold $700 million in 
new general-obligation bonds Wednesday to raise cash for voter-approved 
projects, including new schools and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax-exempt California bonds, in stepped maturities from one to 30 years, 
were generally well received by institutional investors, traders said. The lead 
underwriter of the sale, Lehman Bros., said it has already placed all of the 
bonds with investors except for some maturing between 1996 and 2000 and some in 
the 2005 maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond offering's average interest cost to the state was 5.56%. The 30-year 
issues yielded 6.0%; five-year issues yielded 4.80%.

VIRGINIA GOVERNOR PROPOSES COMPROMISE ON DISNEY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BAKER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. George Allen unveiled a compromise incentive package for a Walt Disney 
Co. theme park Wednesday that would require the company to write a check to the 
state treasury if the project does not produce as much tax revenue as promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to salvage the centerpiece proposal of his young administration, Allen 
presented the plan at a private meeting with key lawmakers who had balked at 
his original $163.2-million offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise package could help the Republican governor break a legislative 
logjam that has stalled his subsidy for the northern Virginia park. It also is 
the first time that either Allen or Disney has retreated from their joint 
all-or-nothing bargaining stance. Time is running out for both as the General 
Assembly heads toward adjournment Saturday. "It's a breakthrough," Allen said 
of the new proposal, which he worked out with company executives during the 
last several weeks. "It's good for the taxpayers of Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor acknowledged that his initial version could not pass and that 
lawmakers had raised credible questions about the state's risk in subsidizing a 
private corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole investment was in jeopardy," he told reporters. "It then became 
imperative that we address the legitimate concerns of the House and Senate . . 
. while also not running the Disney corporation away from this investment in 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 But even in yielding somewhat, Allen and Disney drew a new line in the sand, 
maintaining that the Legislature would still have to fund the full $163 
million.

GM STRIKES A DEAL WITH BATTERY MAKER OVONIC; AUTOS: CAR MAKER WILL PROVIDE 
FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL AID TO ELECTRIC PROPULSION PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. said Wednesday that it is hoping to mass-produce an 
advanced battery that could greatly increase the range of electric vehicles -- 
and to do so it is enlisting a former GM chairman as a key adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto maker said it will provide an undisclosed amount of financial and 
technical help to Ovonic Battery Co. of Troy, Mich., to develop, manufacture 
and commercialize a nickel-metal hydride battery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very promising battery," said Kenneth R. Baker, GM vice president of 
research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Former GM Chairman Robert Stempel will serve as a technical adviser on the 
project. Since his ouster in a 1992 boardroom shake-up, Stempel has been 
serving as an engineering and emissions consultant to GM while exploring 
business opportunities in electric vehicle development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ovonic battery is not the long-sought breakthrough that could match the 
range and cost of gasoline-powered cars. But it can deliver an estimated 
highway-driving range of 140 to 190 miles per charge, substantially more than 
that achieved by current batteries, according to industry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's announcement holds out the possibility that advanced batteries could be 
commercially available by 1998, when California's mandate requiring the sale of 
zero-emission vehicles takes hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto makers want to roll back California's rules -- which in effect 
require them to sell electric vehicles -- saying the technology for an 
affordable, full-performance car is not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The main obstacle is the battery. Current batteries have a limited range, cost 
several thousand dollars each and can wear out in a year or less. In its Impact 
electric vehicle, for instance, GM is using lead-acid batteries. But the test 
car's range is only about 100 miles under optimum conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovonic won the first contract awarded by the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium, 
formed by the Big Three, the electric utility industry and the federal 
government in 1991 to find midterm and long-term solutions to the battery 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford Ovshinsky, chairman of Ovonic's parent company, Energy Conversion 
Devices, said the new agreement with GM puts the financial and technological 
might of the nation's largest industrial company behind his effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovshinsky, a self-educated inventor whose firm has been a chronic money loser, 
declined Wednesday to discuss his battery's performance specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent report by the staff of the California Air Resources Board said the 
Ovonic battery exceeds the battery consortium's midterm goals for energy, power 
and life, but falls short on cost. It added that the battery's long life, 
coupled with high-volume production, should reduce cost substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wallace, who runs Ford's electric vehicle program and is a battery 
consortium director, questioned the report's evaluation of Ovonic's battery.

SOME GLIMMERS OF HOPE FOR CALIFORNIA IN 'BEIGE BOOK'; ECONOMY: STATE STILL LAGS 
REST OF U.S. BUT SPENDING, TOURISM, COMPUTERS ARE BRIGHT SPOTS.

<P>
 California's economy continues to lag that of the rest of the nation, which 
grew modestly at the beginning of 1994 with little sign of rising prices 
despite bad weather, the Federal Reserve Board said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 California's weakness remains centered in the Los Angeles area, home to the 
beleaguered defense and aerospace industries, said the Fed's "beige book" 
report on economic activity from mid-January to Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the worst news concerned continuing declines in aerospace manufacturing 
and sluggishness in construction and real estate. In addition, the oil industry 
in Kern County remains depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But other parts of the state are showing signs of bottoming out or modestly 
improving, the report said. And January's Northridge earthquake, which resulted 
in a "significant loss in quality of life" in the Los Angeles area, 
nevertheless should provide a short-term boost to construction. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other glimmers of hope in the report: 
</P>
<P>
 * Consumer spending showed signs of improvement in San Francisco, San Diego 
and other parts of the state, with the exception of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tourism in Southern California was reportedly improving, despite the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * While manufacturing remained weak in aerospace, defense and wood products, 
computers were up over the last three months and much better than a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * The pace of layoffs in aerospace and defense declined from a year earlier, 
and the recent purchase of commercial aircraft by Saudi Arabia should preserve 
some jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the rest of the nation, "the economy expanded moderately in January and 
February despite unusually severe weather in the East and the Midwest," the Fed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather adversely affected consumer spending and construction, delayed 
shipments, interrupted some production and boosted selected tourism and energy 
markets, but these effects were largely temporary," the Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was generally optimistic about prices. "Retailers in only one 
district, Richmond (Va.), expect retail prices to rise slightly; others 
anticipate stable prices because of competitive pressures," the Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank pushed short-term interest rates higher at the beginning of 
February and has indicated it will do so again when necessary to keep inflation 
restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing activity picked up in most industries across the country, 
notably auto makers and their suppliers, as well as producers of building 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 While merchants in some areas said winter weather hurt retail sales 
considerably at the beginning of 1994, the Fed said, "almost all district 
reports suggest that merchants expect solid sales growth in coming months." 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate markets continued to improve nearly everywhere from a year ago, 
except in Connecticut and Southern California. But rising interest rates slowed 
mortgage refinancings in several regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial distress to farmers from extensive flooding last summer, especially 
in the Midwest, was easing by early 1994, the Fed said.

 Pimco and Thomson Confirm Merger: Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. and 
Thomson Advisory Group made it official, announcing they will merge Pacific 
Mutual's huge investment management business (Pimco) with Thomson to create a 
$70-billion organization.The deal, first rumored a week ago, will provide 
Newport Beach-based Pimco with a new platform from which to launch mutual funds 
for small investors -- a lucrative market that Pimco has served in only limited 
ways until now. Most of Pimco's business is institutional, while Stamford, 
Conn.-based Thomson offers nine mutual funds aimed at small investors.

 Panel Backs Lifting of Interstate Banking Restrictions: Legislation relaxing 
decades-old restrictions on interstate banking passed the House Banking 
Committee over complaints that it would permit big banks to ignore the poor.The 
panel endorsed the bill 50 to 1. But that came after a 34-16 vote defeating an 
amendment that would have required interstate banks to offer the poor either a 
low-cost checking account or a low-cost check-cashing service. On a 34-17 vote, 
the committee rejected forcing banks expanding across state lines to improve 
their services to the poor and minorities. The legislation, in stages, would 
relax interstate restrictions dating back to the 1920s.

 Florida Files Charges Against MetLife Agents: The state accused 87 agents of 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. of fraudulent sales practices.The charges 
followed an agreement by MetLife that could lead to the company paying nearly 
$100 million in fines and restitution. The penalties are to settle charges that 
agents sold life insurance policies to people who thought they were purchasing 
retirement plans. The agents face administrative penalties ranging from fines 
and probation to suspension or revocation of their insurance sales licenses, 
the state Department of Insurance said.

 General Instrument Being Investigated: The Justice Department is investigating 
whether General Instrument Corp., a leading supplier of cable TV equipment, has 
a stranglehold on the market for advanced video services, the New York Times 
reported.People familiar with the probe say the department's antitrust division 
has demanded information from the Chicago-based company about its relationships 
with the cable industry and its technology, the story said. A General 
Instrument spokesman declined to comment. Justice Department spokeswoman Gina 
Talamona said only that the antitrust division was conducting an investigation 
of arrangements that affect the cable industry, the paper said, and would not

RISING RATES GIVE HOME BUYING A BOOST; REAL ESTATE: AGENTS SAY MANY PEOPLE ARE 
RUSHING TO PURCHASE BEFORE MORTGAGE INTEREST MOVES STILL HIGHER. 
</P>

 The recent jump in mortgage rates is contributing to a small boom in home 
buying as people hurry to purchase houses before rates go any higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 30 days, we've had a tremendous rush of buyers. It's really 
stimulating the market," said Dick Loughlin, president and chief executive of 
Century 21, which has 5,000 real estate brokers throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not yet clear how significant the wave of purchasing is. Evidence is 
mostly anecdotal, because statistics on home purchases and housing starts take 
weeks to compile. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts cite other factors for the boomlet besides the interest rate 
increase, including greater consumer confidence as the economy recovers and the 
easing of the severe weather that kept buyers holed up this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several real estate firms around the country said the rise in rates has 
pushed many hesitant buyers into their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Federal Reserve Board survey released Wednesday said U.S. real estate 
markets are improving, with strong or growing residential sales in more than 
half the districts studied. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm hearing is that rising interest rates are taking a lot of people off 
the fence," said Daryl Jesperson, executive vice president of Re-Max 
International, which has 2,200 offices in North America. "They're saying, I'd 
better do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some panicky homeowners have quickly refinanced their mortgages as interest 
rates rose, but analysts said that refinancings overall are down. Sung Won 
Sohn, chief economist with Norwest Corp., a major provider of mortgages, 
predicted refinancings will drop by half from the torrid pace of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, we are talking about fairly significant volume, because last year was 
so high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Average 30-year, fixed mortgage rates rose to 7.62% on Friday from 7.08% in 
early February, according to HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., firm that tracks 
mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 The jump occurred after the Fed engineered the first rise in short-term 
interest rates in five years.

 Now there's "personal conference" software that allows two people on two 
computers connected by a telephone modem to collaborate interactively by 
revising or critiquing the same screen image. 
</P>
<P>
 This promises to be a fast-evolving family of products, so you can look 
forward soon to being able to share actual data files, not just images of them, 
or share a computer program or participate in a session with two others. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the competitors are Intel Corp. ((800) 538-3373), whose ProShare family 
of products ranges from a $99 entry-level program to a $2,499 package that 
includes live video. DataBeam Corp. ((800) 877-2325) has FarSite for Windows, 
available bundled with a trend-setting modem from AT&T that can transmit voice 
and data simultaneously over a standard telephone line. Crosswise Corp. ((408) 
459-9060) has Face to Face, a Mac-to-Mac product, with a Mac-to-Windows version 
scheduled for release in April. 
</P>
<P>
 What all of these programs have in common is that they allow two computer 
users to link screens via phone line and carry on a "discussion" about a 
document appearing on both screens. They "talk" by typing and using various 
graphics tools to highlight portions of the image in colors, or by drawing 
symbols or writing on the screens with their mice. 
</P>
<P>
 At the entry level of this category of software, the screen images are just 
"bit-mapped" copies of whatever documents each participant has chosen to 
prepare in advance of the electronic conference. It's just as if you had 
printed the documents on paper and passed them out at a meeting for everyone to 
mark up. 
</P>
<P>
 When the meeting is over, you'll have the marked-up image files in your 
computer, just as you would have marked-up pages. You'll still have to make the 
agreed changes in the original files. But, unlike life with paper, each 
participant can quickly add images of new files to the on-line conference while 
it is underway. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the programs has its own design metaphor to try to make its use more 
intuitive. 
</P>
<P>
 FarSite treats its screen images as if they were a series of slides to be 
projected. ProShare's screen resembles a page in a spiral-bound notebook, with 
tabs on the side to let you easily choose which page to view. The Face to Face 
screen simply presents images in a "document window," much as if you were 
viewing a printed page on the screen. This $295 program allows comments to be 
superimposed on the document image, like paper Post-It notes. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs require virtually no knowledge of the communications arcana 
(about protocols and parameters) that makes ordinary computer-to-computer modem 
connections so difficult. The downside is that both participants have to have 
the same program, although not necessarily the same kind of modem or even the 
same speed of modem. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel's $99 ProShare has one advantage over the others: You can use it to 
connect to another computer that has modem software but not ProShare, and the 
program will up-load a receive-only copy of itself to the other computer. The 
user of that machine can then answer ProShare calls, but would have to buy a 
full version of the program to be able to call others. 
</P>
<P>
 FarSite is particularly useful because of the unique voice capability of the 
AT&T modem available as a $549 modem-software bundle. (The software alone is 
$179.) When the program is operating in data-only mode, it can transmit at 
14,400 bits a second. 
</P>
<P>
 If each user has a telephone connected to the modem, all one has to do is pick 
up the receiver during a FarSite session and the telephone at the other end 
will ring. The data speed falls to 4,800 bits a second while you're talking, 
but jumps up automatically as soon as  
</P>
<P>
 The advantage is that with only a single phone line shared by computer and 
voice phone, you can simultaneously engage in an on-screen markup session and 
discuss the details with your collaborator. Of course, in offices where modems 
have their own telephone lines, you can use any of these products and talk over 
the voice line while communicating at full modem speed over the separate data 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The high ground in computer conference products is held by Intel's ProShare 
Video system, which is typically bought through the telephone company at huge 
discounts off its $2,499 list price. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone company is going to make its money selling you an 
ultra-high-speed telephone line, called ISDN service, to accommodate the mass 
of data the Intel system transmits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, you will need a powerful computer, at least a 486 machine running 
at 33 megahertz, and with two empty slots inside to hold the two processor 
cards that come with the ProShare system. 
</P>
<P>
 You also get a small video camera housed in a squat case designed to sit on 
top of your monitor and capture your image as you work at the computer. A small 
combination earphone-microphone takes care of the audio. 
</P>
<P>
 Video conferencing is not as easy as voice, despite the clever design of the 
ProShare software. The video image, which can be an eighth as large as your 
screen or as small as a thumbnail, is broadcast at half the number of frames 
per second we see on broadcast television. Movement is jerky and resolution is 
quite grainy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high band width available on the expensive ISDN phone line 
required for the system, the video signal is blanked out while data is being 
transmitted, such as when sending the next page in the spiral notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is considerably more disconcerting is that the audio signal is lost 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, you can send segments from a videotape or any other video 
signal over the system, and you can move the small Intel camera around to 
portray objects that aren't in your computer files, such as photographs or 
product samples.

RAYTHEON SET TO LAUNCH RESTRUCTURING; DEFENSE: THE MAKER OF THE PATRIOT 
MISSILE, CITING MILITARY CUTBACKS, WILL CLOSE SOME PLANTS AND LAY OFF UP TO 
4,400 WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raytheon Co., maker of the Patriot missile, is shutting down plants and 
shedding about 4,400 employees because of the massive cuts in U.S. defense 
spending, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring will result in a first-quarter, after-tax charge of $162 
million, the defense contractor said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 65% of the charge, which amounts to $1.20 a share, is related to the 
company's defense business, it said. Raytheon makes defense electronics, small 
airplanes, appliances and Patriot missiles, which were used during the Gulf War 
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lexington, Mass.-based military contractor said it is consolidating to 
maintain its competitive position. It said that before the 
restructuring-related charge, sales and earnings for the first quarter were 
expected to hit record levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon's restructuring will take place over the next two years. It could 
result in layoffs of about 4,400 workers, or 7% of the work force, the company 
said in a statement. None of the layoffs will occur in California, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon said the move was not prompted by an Army recommendation against 
buying the latest Patriot missiles, but by broad cuts in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said the restructuring should bring swift cost savings and 
sharpen Raytheon's competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon's stock closed up 62.5 cents at $64.625 on Wednesday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, FMC Corp., maker of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, 
said it is moving most of its production out of California as a result of a 
merger and the shrinking defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Jose, 500 people, a fifth of the company's work force, will have lost 
their jobs when the move is completed in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The company employed a peak of 7,500 people at four San Jose locations in 
1984. Since then, its work force has shrunk to 2,300. The company said it will 
keep 1,300 people in San Jose after the move takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement had been expected since FMC's local operations merged with 
the BMY Combat Systems Division of Harsco Corp. of Camp Hill, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 FMC, based in Chicago, said it will transfer most of its production to 
Pennsylvania, combining most of its heavy-manufacturing operations at the BMY 
plant in York, Pa.

NISSAN, FTC SETTLE CASE INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF FALSE ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. agreed Wednesday to settle false-advertising charges 
involving a 1990 promotional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission said Nissan had promised $100, "no catch," to 
consumers who bought a Toyota or Honda after test-driving a Nissan Stanza.The 
FTC said the ads falsely implied consumers could readily receive the payment. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC said the offer involved significant restrictions, requiring consumers 
to buy the new car, take delivery of it and present the paperwork to Nissan 
within seven days of the test drive. Failure to disclose those conditions was 
deceptive, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement requires Nissan to disclose restrictions in future promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan said it believes the promotion was fair and accurate but that it agreed 
to settle the matter "in the interest of consumers." No monetary settlement is 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan said it paid out "hundreds of thousands of dollars" as a result of the 
promotion. It no longer makes the Stanza. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC approved the settlement 3 to 2, with Chairwoman Janet D. Steiger and 
Commissioner Dennis A. Yao dissenting. In a joint statement, they expressed 
concern that the settlement "may give implicit approval to the use of seemingly 
attractive promotional offers that many consumers simply cannot utilize because 
of limitations." 
</P>
<P>
 They also said the settlement could be interpreted to mean that advertisers 
need not disclose restrictions unless they make a "no catches" claim.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CSUN TO FIELD A FEW JARRING REMINDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 14 games on the road, the Cal State Northridge softball team finally 
will play its home opener when 20th-ranked Missouri visits for a doubleheader 
Saturday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's next 10 games -- doubleheaders against Southern Utah, Utah, 
Kansas and Ohio State follow Missouri -- are at home and Coach Gary Torgeson is 
hopeful the Matadors will prove tougher than usual to defeat on their diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons: unusual surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge softball field is adjacent to a field of portable trailers that 
are serving as classrooms while the university attempts to recover from the 
damage of January's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that's a home-field advantage," Torgeson said. "There's still enough 
destruction to see and enough talk about the quake going around. If that takes 
a little focus off the game for some teams, then that's a plus." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson, whose team was 27-4-1 at home last season, said the Matadors have 
grown used to the distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We practice in the middle of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Chevalier was riding the crest of a wave of hoop hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just capped a brilliant four years as a Matador by scoring a 
personal-high 38 points to eclipse a Northridge career scoring record that 
stood for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He was smiling. He was laughing. He described the Matadors' 95-87 victory over 
San Diego State using such terms as "lovely" and "perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the excitement it was obvious that it was difficult to place his own 
individual accomplishments into perspective so quickly. As soon as Chevalier 
arrived at the visiting team's locker room, he was doused by a celebratory 
bucket of ice water. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier was still dripping when reporters arrived and began volleying 
questions. There was little time to reflect. But for Brooklyn McLinn, 
Chevalier's senior backcourt mate, there were a few moments to pause. 
</P>
<P>
 As Chevalier talked about his record performance and a big win for the 
Northridge team, McLinn sat close by, deep in thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel funny right now," he said. "Just listening to Andre talk, in my mind 
my whole career is fast-forwarding through my brain." 
</P>
<P>
 That career started five years ago when McLinn, a part-time starter at Taft 
High, tried out for the Northridge team as a non-scholarship player. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, he quit. The year after that, he tried out again, and played his 
way back into favor. 
</P>
<P>
 McLinn, a 6-1 southpaw, was a full-time starter his last two seasons. He 
finished his career with 131 three-point baskets in 375 attempts, both school 
records. He is second on the all-time list with 134 career steals, including 61 
this season -- one shy of the single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
 "To think where I started the things I've been able to accomplish," he said. 
"It's a happy feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge players not only offered up the ball to Chevalier, they offered 
their playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hill, Chevalier's understudy at point guard, approached Cassidy before 
the game and offered to sit as long as it took for his friend and tutor to get 
the scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he didn't care if he didn't get to play a minute," Cassidy said. "He 
wanted Andre to get every chance possible to get the record. That was a very 
unselfish attitude on Rob's part and I think most of the team felt that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiment seems appropriate because Chevalier spent most of his four 
seasons trying to set up teammates for points rather than score them himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the scoring record, which now stands at 1,311 points, Chevalier 
owns Northridge career standards with 481 assists, 184 steals and 396 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's victory over San Diego State marked the Matadors' first in a 
Division I season-ender. 
</P>
<P>
 The three previous seasons, Northridge lost to California, 99-78; Brigham 
Young, 100-68, and the University of San Diego, 82-51. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to win a season finale for a change," McLinn said. "We're used 
to getting blown out by 30." CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
<P>
 A Coach's Advice 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen baseball team is off until March 20 when it plays Linfield (Ore.) 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Marty Slimak gave his players the entire week off from practice for a 
spring break, asking them to return next Monday to resume workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many stayed around campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the team is in Mexico and the other half is in Vegas," Slimak said. "I 
hope we have a team when it's time to come back. I also hope none of the guys 
got married in either of those places." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran hasn't skipped a beat with Slimak, the former pitching coach, 
taking over as skipper for Rich Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen are 10-2-1, 9-0 in the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the fast start, Slimak has found opportunities to second-guess 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if you're in your first year or your 10th year, there are 
always situations when you second-guess yourself," he said. "I don't care if 
you're Sparky Anderson. Second-guessing yourself is part of baseball." Around 
the Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Seniors Damon Ridley and Paul Tapp have moved into 16th and 17th on Cal 
Lutheran's career scoring list with 969 and 946 points, respectively. Ridley 
has averaged 17.9 points a game during his two seasons as a Kingsmen, and Tapp 
has averaged 8.8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rupert Sapwell ranks 14th on Cal Lutheran's career rebounding list with 432. 
Sapwell is averaging seven rebounds a game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Master's point guard Andy Thompson has 45 assists in his last four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shannon Jones leads the Northridge softball team with a .429 batting 
average, 15 hits, nine runs batted in, two home runs and a slugging percentage 
of .629.  
</P>
<P>
 * Kathy Blake, is the fifth Northridge pitcher to win 50 games. Blake, a 
junior, has a career record of 51-11. She can tie Heather Lindstrom for fourth 
place on the school's career win list by defeating Missouri on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 * Tannel House moved to seventh on the all-time Matador lists in the long jump 
and triple jump with her victorious performances in Saturday's meet against Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo, UC Irvine and USC. House leaped 20 feet 1/4 inch in the 
long jump and 39-8 1/2 in the triple jump.

 Cal State Northridge announced the signing of 10 more football recruits this 
week--seven high school players and three from junior colleges. The Matadors, 
4-6 last season, have brought in 14 new players during the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still are not finished with our recruiting process, but I think we've put 
together an outstanding class," Coach Bob Burt said. "This will probably prove 
to be the best high school recruiting class that we've had in years. . . . We 
focused very hard on the inside front seven positions on both sides of the

SOUTHWEST LINING UP NEW FLIGHTS OUT OF O.C.; AIRLINES: IT SEEKS TO OFFER 15 
TRIPS FROM JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT TO SAN JOSE AND OAKLAND, A MOVE THAT COULD LOWER 
FARES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that could significantly lower fares to the Bay Area and Silicon 
Valley, Southwest Airlines said it wants to operate its 15 new flights from 
Orange County's John Wayne Airport exclusively to San Jose and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 But both airport and airline officials caution that the flight list proposed 
by the airline is likely to change. The new flights are scheduled to begin May 
26, just in time for the summer holiday period. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Southwest said it plans to offer seven daily flights to Oakland 
and eight flights to San Jose. The only exceptions would be one of the evening 
Oakland flights would not operate on Saturdays and an early morning flight to 
San Jose would not operate on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule was filed with John Wayne Airport as a requirement to begin 
operation. The way for Southwest to fly into Orange County was paved recently 
with its purchase of Morris Air Service, another low-cost, low-fare carrier. 
Southwest's proposed schedule indicates that it plans to maintain what were 
Morris' two daily flights to Salt Lake City, which now have an unrestricted 
fare of $119 one way. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of Southwest has been long awaited because air fares often drop 
for routes where it begins to compete. Southwest, with some of the lowest 
operating costs in the airline industry, has thrived by offering low fares on 
short-haul trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Chairman Herb Kelleher said in a recent interview with The Times 
that one of the reasons he wanted to acquire Morris Air was to speed up 
Southwest's entry into the Orange County market. 
</P>
<P>
 While Southwest has not provided any clues about the fares it will charge, a 
spokeswoman said that it will likely offer the same $69 anytime one-way fare to 
any California destination that it has offered from other Southland airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Its major competition would include Alaska Airlines, which offers a $99 
anytime one-way weekday fare to Oakland on its five flights, and American 
Airlines, which services San Jose with eight weekday daily flights and an 
unrestricted one-way fare of $119. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices are going to drop, specifically to San Jose and probably to Oakland as 
well," said Thomas Nulty, president of Associated Travel in Santa Ana, one of 
the nation's largest travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 An American Airlines spokesman in Dallas said Wednesday that his airline may 
pull out of the route to avoid competing. Southwest "is really tough to compete 
with on price, no question" and "we may not be there very long," spokesman 
Marty Hires said. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, Nulty said it could leave room for another low-cost carrier, 
like Reno Air, to come in and grab up American's unused slots. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Alaska, "they will probably continue in that market because their real 
interest lies in traffic beyond Oakland," such as business travelers continuing 
to the Pacific Northwest, Nulty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis C. Cancelmi, a spokesman for Alaska Airlines in Seattle, said his 
company competes with Southwest on other routes, offering the same low fares 
with more frills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gone through an exhaustive process . . . with the assumption that low 
prices are going to be with us for a long time," Cancelmi said. "As a result of 
that, we have made many changes, changes that allow us to significantly lower 
our operating costs. So by virtue of our lower costs, we can compete with 
anything anybody offers."

 Orange Country: The nation said "Howdy" to a new Orange County publication 
when That's Country hit national newsstands in January. The magazine, which 
sells for $3.75 a copy, started local publication last April to cover the 
country-Western lifestyle, said Christopher Burkhardt, editor-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a dozen magazines that cover country music," he said. "We cover the 
lifestyle, everything from dancing to fashion to household furnishings." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County? Sure.  
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa office is "far enough from the bustle of L.A. and its drugstore 
cowboys, and it's close enough to the ranches of South County," said Burkhardt, 
a Kalamazoo, Mich., native. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine prints 175,000 copies monthly, plans to switch to a twice-monthly 
format in April and may turn a profit within two years, Burkhardt said.

BEAUTY-AIDS MAKER FIRES TOP EXECUTIVE; TERMINATION: ADVANTAGE LIFE PRODUCTS OF 
LAGUNA HILLS WON'T SAY WHAT LED TO OUSTER. COMPANY HAS STRUGGLED FINANCIALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Advantage Life Products Inc., the beauty-aids marketer known for its use of 
infomercials to push its products, said Wednesday that it had fired its chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills company said that, in a vote Tuesday night, the five-member 
board of directors "terminated the employment" of Chief Executive Michael 
Ackerman, who took over the financially struggling firm's top spot less than 
eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerman, who remains a member of the board, was immediately replaced by the 
company's chief financial officer, Jim Stapleton, who will run the company on 
an interim basis while directors launch a nationwide executive search. 
</P>
<P>
 Stapleton declined to say what led to Ackerman's sudden dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a variety of reasons," Stapleton said, adding that it is likely 
the company will detail the reasons for Ackerman's firing "in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerman, who was unavailable Wednesday for comment, can only be removed from 
his board spot by shareholders during the firm's annual meeting, scheduled for 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hired to be Advantage Life's chief executive officer when the company 
bought privately held Lasting Cosmetics Inc., based in New York, in July in an 
all-stock deal valued at $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasting Cosmetics, which was founded and owned by Ackerman, was best known for 
its 30-minute television commercial hosted by actress Loretta Swit, who 
demonstrated the company's Lasting Kiss, a non-smudging lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerman came to a company that has been struggling financially for several 
years. Last year, Advantage Life narrowly escaped further financial problems 
when it sold the rights to its controversial CigArrest smoking-cessation kit, 
four months before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a ban against 
it and similar stop-smoking products. 
</P>
<P>
 It had marketed CigArrest and other products, such as Cholest-Control, 
InsomAway and PMS Solutions, directly to consumers through infomercials -- 
forms of advertising that have come under fire because they often resemble news 
or talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage Life, nevertheless, continues to have its share of on-again, 
off-again troubles. It has suffered losses in two of its last four quarters. 
Though it showed an annual profit of $216,459 for fiscal 1993, which ended 
April 30, 1993, its fiscal 1992 loss was $2.2 million on $1.2 million in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Stapleton said that the company was moving forward with introducing other 
products it purchased with Lasting Cosmetic's acquisition, including its Secret 
Hair hairstyling product, which it plans to begin selling soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is that I don't see this (firing) as having any impact on our 
growth strategy," Stapleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage Life stock fell 3.125 cents a share Wednesday on the Nasdaq market, 
to close at 50 cents a share.

 Emmitt Smith, star running back for the Dallas Cowboys, found that the road 
from the Super Bowl leads to the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after the Cowboys' victory over the Buffalo Bills, Smith announced 
in commercials aired during the "Today" show and "Good Morning America," "I'm 
going to Disneyland!" 
</P>
<P>
 The overnight turnaround was made possible by fiber-optic splitting. Western 
International Media's Spot Link division edited the Smith commercial overnight 
for the theme park and transmitted it to the TV networks using fiber-optics.

PACIFICARE SUPPLANTS FHP AS TOP SUPPLIER OF CARE FOR THE ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. said Wednesday that it has nudged FHP 
International Inc. out of its long-held position as the nation's largest 
supplier of managed-care benefits for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement that PacifiCare, a Cypress-based health maintenance 
organization, has more Medicare recipients on its membership rolls than 
Fountain Valley-based FHP International Inc. is sure to escalate the two 
companies' battle to sign up seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 HMOs across the nation are scrambling to enroll Medicare recipients in their 
managed-care plans. Such enrollees are considered lucrative for HMOs because 
the federal government pays the companies an average of $400 a month for each 
Medicare recipient they sign up. In return for that guaranteed revenue, the 
companies offer enrollees full medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Though virtually all HMOs either have or are considering strategies to enroll 
seniors, PacifiCare and FHP are the undisputed leaders of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been watching this for a while," PacifiCare Chief Executive Alan 
Hoops said of his company's rising Medicare HMO enrollment. "It's an important 
market for us." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last year, PacifiCare's senior enrollment has been steadily gaining on 
that of FHP, which was the first company to offer such benefits on the West 
Coast. In 1981, FHP participated in a government-sponsored pilot program when 
the U.S. Health Care Finance Administration began considering the possibility 
of allowing HMOs to enroll Medicare recipients as a way to save money. Medicare 
HMOs became legal in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first-place spot will be hard to hold. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare has 317,968 Medicare recipients enrolled in its Secure Horizons 
Medicare plan -- only 579 more than FHP's total enrollment in its Senior Plan 
and Senior Plus Plan, according to the latest federal government figures, 
released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street responded positively to the news that both companies have made 
gains in the last year. PacifiCare rose $1.75 a share on the Nasdaq market to 
close at $52.50. FHP stock, also traded on Nasdaq, gained 75 cents to close at 
$26.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 At FHP, officials expressed mild disappointment with the latest figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so close," spokeswoman Ria Carlson said. "Well, I guess congratulations 
are in order for PacifiCare." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson said holding the lead may prove more difficult for PacifiCare than 
achieving it. Though PacifiCare has been enrolling Medicare beneficiaries at a 
steady clip, FHP may soon get a shot in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The company announced in January that it will buy TakeCare Inc., a Northern 
California HMO. The buyout, if approved by shareholders and regulators, would 
create a company with 1.6 million members. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, the proposed $1-billion deal would give FHP a much-needed 
inroad into the Medicare HMO markets in Northern California and Colorado, two 
regions where TakeCare is most active. Secure Horizons Takes No. 1 Spot 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare's Secure Horizons senior health care plan has edged past FHP to 
become the largest Medicare HMO in the nation. PacifiCare and FHP share about 
one-third of the HMO market. Medicare recipients in the top five HMOs: 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare: 317,968 FHP: 317,389 Humana: 275,952 Kaiser Permanente: 219,946 
United Health Care: 88,110 All others: 650,626

Irvine-based Lawrence & Mayo to develop its 1994 education program for 
health-care providers.The campaign marks the foundation's first targeted effort 
to that group.

<P>
 The ad agency's campaign publicizes the foundation's services for patients 
with AIDS symptoms: benefits counseling, mental health programs, a food pantry 
and shelter services.  
</P>

 The campaign was paid for with funds from the Ryan White CARE Act, a federal 
fund named for the Indiana teen-ager who contracted AIDS during treatment for 
hemophilia and who crusaded against AIDS discrimination until his death.

ARBITRATOR GIVES CARL'S JR. BUYERS' GROUP $3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An arbitrator has ruled that Carl Karcher Enterprises must pay $3 million to a 
group of investors that had been negotiating to buy several Carl's Jr. 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment will result in a net loss of about 5 cents a share for the fourth 
quarter ended Jan. 31, company officials said Wednesday.Final fourth-quarter 
and annual financial figures will be released in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises reported a loss of 73 cents a share for the same period a 
year earlier, a loss that was driven by a corporate restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The award will have no effect on the company's (profitable operations) or on 
the progress we are making in pursuing our corporate growth objectives," 
Karcher Enterprises President Donald E. Doyle said Wednesday. "We are surprised 
and extremely disappointed with the outcome, since the company believed it had 
a solid defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials would not identify the disgruntled investors, who alleged 
that Karcher Enterprises failed to comply with terms of a contract dealing with 
the planned acquisition of several Carl's Jr. restaurants. The investors 
brought suit in California Superior Court in October, 1992, and the company 
agreed to transfer the matter to binding arbitration in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The arbitrator agreed with the investors, who maintained that Karcher 
Enterprises failed to comply with "verbal modifications" to the contract made 
by a company executive. A Karcher Enterprises spokesman maintained that the 
written contract with the investors "was clear" and that "conditions for 
finalizing the agreement were not fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, Karcher Enterprises on Wednesday approved an 
employment agreement that officially returns founder Carl N. Karcher to the 
company as chairman emeritus. Karcher was forced out as chairman in October 
during a bitter dispute over the company's strategic direction.

PACIFIC MUTUAL, THOMSON MERGE UNITS INTO $70-BILLION GIANT; INVESTING: IT WILL 
PROVIDE NEWPORT BEACH-BASED PIMCO A PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO LAUNCH MUTUAL FUNDS 
FOR SMALL CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual Life Insurance and Thomson Advisory Group made it official 
Wednesday, announcing they will merge Pacific Mutual's huge investment 
management business known as PIMCO with Thomson to create a $70-billion 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, first rumored a week ago, will provide Newport Beach-based PIMCO 
with a new platform from which to launch mutual funds for small investors -- a 
lucrative market that PIMCO has served in only limited ways until now. Most of 
PIMCO's business is institutional. 
</P>
<P>
 William Thompson, PIMCO's chief executive, confirmed that while the company 
has no plans to diminish services to its many institutional clients, "we think 
the retail marketplace is a very attractive one." That could include products 
designed for retirement savings programs, such as 401(k) plans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Stamford, Conn.-based Thomson Advisory is a limited partnership whose 
shares, or units, trade on the New York Stock Exchange, the deal also allows 
PIMCO executives and Pacific Mutual to liquefy their substantial investment in 
PIMCO. Shares of the merged entity will continue to trade on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ensures the longevity of the company by allowing us to offer equity to 
many of our professionals," said William Gross, a PIMCO managing director who 
is considered one of the nation's savviest bond investors. "Before, we never 
had the possibility of owning part of our own company." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the merger agreement, the 4.3 million Thomson Advisory units held by the 
public will become Class A units of the new operation, to be named PIMCO 
Advisors L.P. (limited partnership). Pacific Mutual and PIMCO managers will 
receive 12.35 million Class A units and 12.35 million Class B units in the new 
PIMCO Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Pacific Mutual and PIMCO managers will jointly become the general 
partner of the new entity by buying a controlling interest in Thomson's current 
general partner for about $140 million. That stake is held by venture capital 
firms that helped bankroll Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson currently manages $11.6 billion in nine mutual funds and in private 
accounts, while PIMCO has about $60 billion under management, including 11 
mutual funds. But PIMCO's funds have $500,000 minimum investment requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 PIMCO officials said they contemplate no major staff changes in Newport Beach 
or Stamford. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson Advisory units on the NYSE soared $3.50 to $38.25 on Wednesday, 
suggesting that Wall Street is happy with the deal.

 Biomerica Inc. said its Allergy Immuno Technologies Inc. unit has been issued 
a patent for a new method of treating allergies.

 In a press release, the company said the latest patent covers an invention

combined with something called a biological response modifier. The patent 
covers a class of such modifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Biomerica said it plans to enter a "collaborative arrangement" with a drug 
company to use the invention. In the meantime, the company said, it intends to

ZEROING IN ON TAKEOVER TARGETS THAT PAY; INVESTMENTS: THOSE WHO SCOUR THE 
MARKET WITH THE CARE OF POTENTIAL ACQUISITORS MAY COME OUT WELL AHEAD.

<P>
 Wouldn't it be fun to sell Grumman to Martin Marietta, Paramount to Viacom, 
Dreyfus Corp. to Mellon Bank? 
</P>
<P>
 Mega-mergers are back, and there's money to be made by investors lucky enough 
to be holding shares of takeover targets when the suitors come calling. 
</P>
<P>
 This is true despite the failure of the proposed merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. 
and Tele-Communications Inc. In fact, the faltering of that deal may underscore 
the trend toward slow-to-develop, more cautious mergers. 
</P>
<P>
 That bodes well for investors who scour the market with the same careful 
consideration as potential acquisitors. Even if the sharks never bite, these 
investors could end up holding some very attractive companies. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the sharks do bite, a word to the wise: Don't hold out for the last 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI holders who sold the first day or two after the Bell Atlantic announcement 
made out very well. Those who held out for the last hurrah are probably 
regretting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even mergers that are consummated often have a way of losing money for many 
years after the marriage takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferris, Baker Watts economist Robert Brown warns that an increasing number of 
acquisitions today are being paid for with shares in the parent company instead 
of cold hard cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait until the merger takes place, and you can be left with diluted and 
overextended shares of the adoptive parent instead of the gains of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 To find the places corporate shoppers might be looking, consider these points: 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for companies that have something to offer in the new and future 
marketplace. Banks are looking for mutual fund companies and banks with a 
presence in fast-growing states. Medical companies are looking for managed care 
expertise, generic drug manufacturers and high-end genetic research efforts 
already underway. Everyone's looking for a lift down the information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for companies that have that indescribable something. East Brunswick, 
N.J., corporate appraiser Russell Parr notes that intangible assets, such as a 
loyal customer following, good name, history of big image advertising and 
catalogue of intellectual property such as inventions, trademarks and 
copyrights, can make a company worth more than its traditional book value or 
earnings measurement might indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for companies that are selling cheap. In particular, companies that 
have market capitalization at or below their book value. Even if they don't get 
gobbled up, it is the law of the marketplace that undervalued companies rise to 
their correct values. Remember, in checking this out, that companies might 
actually be overestimating their book value if they are holding large tracts of 
land valued at tiptop 1980s prices instead of more realistic post-slump real 
estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for companies with cash of their own. Cornell University finance 
Professor Steve Carvell has long advocated screening for potential takeover 
targets by focusing on firms that could buy themselves back out of their own 
cash flow in five or six years. A current price-to-cash-flow per-share ratio of 
5 or 6, he notes, means the target is far from hard up for money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for successful companies. Firms that have high profit margins and 
strong sales are natural targets. Companies would rather buy companies that are 
already making money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for companies that have kept their long-term debts to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for companies that have their own little, or large, market niches.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STAR STABBED TO DEATH; VIOLENCE: A 14-YEAR-OLD IS HELD ON 
SUSPICION OF MURDER AFTER THE ATTACK, APPARENTLY PROMPTED BY UNFOUNDED BELIEF 
THAT THE VICTIM MIGHT STEAL A CAR. FAMILY, RANCHO ALAMITOS CLASSMATES ARE 
STUNNED.

<P>
 A star running back for Rancho Alamitos High School was stabbed to death, 
apparently in a senseless misunderstanding over a dune buggy, and a 14-year-old 
was arrested on suspicion of murder, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen-year-old Moukda Chounlamany had just picked up his younger brother 
from a friend's house in the 12700 block of Louise Street about 9 p.m. Tuesday 
when a teen-ager approached and started punching Chounlamany through his car 
window, the brother said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chounlamany stepped out of the car he was stabbed in the chest. He 
crumpled to the ground in the apartment parking lot and died in the arms of a 
longtime friend, 18-year-old Phong Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I turned to see Moukda, I didn't see no one. I thought he got away, but 
then I saw him lying on the ground," Nguyen said. "I was trying to shake him, 
to see if he was OK, but he just moaned." 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old suspect fled from the scene after stabbing Chounlamany once 
with a large knife but returned several hours later and turned himself over to 
police, Garden Grove Police Lt. John Woods said. He is being held at Orange 
County Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany's brother said the suspect had confronted him earlier, before 
Chounlamany arrived, punching him in the jaw for taking a long look at a parked 
white dune buggy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just looked at it, like you look at a car, and the guy came up to me and 
said, 'What were you gonna do?"' said Tootoo Chounlamany, 15. "He thought I 
wanted to steal it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tootoo said he and his friends were questioned by police about whether they 
were in fact trying to steal a car. The predominantly working-class 
neighborhood is the scene of frequent car thefts and burglaries, neighbors 
there said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chounlamany family moved to the area from Laos in 1982 with five children, 
Tootoo said. Now, only Tootoo and his two sisters remain. His oldest brother, 
Bourapha Chounlamany, graduated from Rancho Alamitos High School in 1992 and 
was killed in a car accident returning from Riverside later that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tootoo said Wednesday that his mother was "crazy" with shock and grief.  
</P>
<P>
 Flags flew at half-staff at Rancho Alamitos High School on Wednesday, and a 
team of counselors comforted crying students well into the afternoon. Hanging 
in the office lobby in memory of the slain student, whom everyone described as 
well-liked, was a painting he had entered in a districtwide art show, a 
brightly colored pastel rendition of Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany's bedroom was filled with Sanders memorabilia, his friends said, 
and he even carried a Sanders football card in his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany had been urging his art teacher, Paula Reynozo, for a week to 
bring back the Barry Sanders picture from the show. On Tuesday night she did, 
and on Wednesday, not knowing, she brought it to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were always impressed with everything he did, and if I were to 
blindly pick out the most successful project, 90% of the time it would be his," 
Reynozo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students are shocked," she added. "He was so accepted and so popular and 
did so well at sports. He had a sharp personality, and always a smile, like 
there was a little secret going on with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany had plans to go to community college and possibly study 
engineering, counselor Gay Chapman said. He had 2.89 average and was ahead on 
his credits to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the high school's spring open house Wednesday night, officials planned to 
take up a collection to help the family, and the school cheerleaders and dance 
team plan a fund-raising bake sale for Friday, assistant principal Connie Van 
Luit said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was fast. He was funny. He was fun to be with," said 18-year-old Josh 
Bradley, a junior who ran track with Chounlamany. 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany was 5-foot-6 and weighed 150 pounds. His small size and quickness 
enabled him to become a standout running back for the the Rancho Alamitos High 
School Vaqueros varsity football team last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Head coach Doug Case said Wednesday that Chounlamany was a student who 
"excelled both on and off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 He was an unknown quantity to the coaches at the start of the season, but when 
the scheduled starter became injured before the first game, the teen-ager 
stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran tough and had no fear," assistant coach Dean Jacobs said. "He was so 
tough running up the middle and he was so small that he would duck behind the 
linemen. They liked blocking for him because he was the kind of kid who didn't 
toot his own horn." 
</P>
<P>
 He was the spark, his coaches said, that ignited the team and led them to the 
Southern Section Football Playoffs Division VII Championship last December. He 
was selected second team All-League for the eight-team Garden Grove league. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't have gotten to the playoffs without him, that's for sure," Case 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Case, who has coached football at the school for 10 years, said the stabbing 
has had a devastating effect on Chounlamany's teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tragic that something like this could happen to such a fine young man," 
Case said. "It makes me both angry and sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany was also a sprinter for the Rancho Alamitos High School track 
team. He ran the 100- and 200-yard dashes and was on the relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 His closest friends and family milled around the Chounlamany house in Stanton 
on Wednesday to grapple with the murder. As they spoke of Chounlamany, a 
handful of robed Buddhist monks solemnly filed into the house to pray with the 
family.  
</P>
<P>
 They will preside over private funeral services this weekend, Tootoo said, and 
all the males who are younger than Moukda will shave their heads and eyebrows 
to pay their respects to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so innocent," Tootoo said. "I'm his younger brother and he's way more 
innocent than me. The only time he wore baggy pants is when he wore my pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's a racial thing . . . you know, Asian guys in baggy pants. Maybe 
another Asian guy tried to start something with him once before," Tootoo said, 
pondering the suspect's motive. "But I still don't know why he'd want to stab 
my brother. He didn't know nothing. He didn't even hang around with the gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Middle linebacker and close friend Adam Maldonado, 18, said Chounlamany was 
"always trying to break up things, be the peacemaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado last saw Chounlamany Monday night when he went to visit him at his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the nicest guys you could ever know," Maldonado said. "He was 
always there for people. He was the most forgiving person, outrageously kind, 
and he should rest in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all loved him."

UNITED WAY TOPS GOAL; FIRST TIME SINCE '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's United Way ended its annual campaign Wednesday by exceeding 
its goal for the first time since 1989, collecting $19.3 million in pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We view this as a turnaround year after a couple of difficult years," said 
Jeff Rocke, a United Way spokesman. "We're optimistic this will carry over into 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign's total exceeded its goal of $18.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The local chapter of the United Way is affiliated with 109 government agencies 
and more than 1,000 charitable organizations, including the Salvation Army, the 
American Cancer Society, Goodwill Industries and various senior citizen and 
children's centers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 and 1992, donations to the Orange County chapter dropped by 6% and 9% 
respectively. Overall, contributions dropped a total of $2.1 million from 1990 
to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel very fortunate in this environment to have our fund-raising campaign 
headed upward," Rocke said. "The economy and skepticism about charities had 
influenced giving in Orange County and the nation. . . . Now it seems that 
attitudes are turning around and that there is an upswing in consumer 
confidence and a better feeling about the fate of the economy. All of those 
things feed into charitable giving." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the group was stung by allegations of improper spending by the United 
Way's national president, William Aramony, who was earning $390,000 a year. The 
controversy put the charity and other nonprofit groups under close scrutiny. 
The Orange County branch of the United Way distanced itself from Aramony, and 
local officials expressed frustration at the effect on donations. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's drive came as a welcome surprise to the local United Way, which 
raised nearly $1 million more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Disneyland Hotel Wednesday morning, about 700 people gathered to 
celebrate the successful campaign and honor those who contributed the most. 
</P>
<P>
 At Johnson & Higgins, an insurance brokerage firm with 60 offices in Orange 
County, employees gave an average of $405 each to United Way, making them the 
employees who gave the largest percentage of their salaries to the charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very proud of it," said Mason Williams, the company's executive vice 
president. "We as a firm believe very strongly that you need to give to the 
community you're in. We consider ourselves leaders in the community and we want 
to set the pace." 
</P>
<P>
 The firm raised about $30,000 for the United Way campaign, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocke said the United Way's major contributors are "traditional" supporters -- 
large companies that have a history of working with the charity group. They 
include Pacific Mutual, Southern California Edison and Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take the increase in traditional support and couple it with 
increased participation from new donors, that's where the 5% growth can be 
traced," said Rocke. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the supporters recognized were Southern California Gas Company; Pfizer 
Inc.; Norton Reese Marketing and Graphic Design; and Huntington Beach Community 
Clinic. Twenty-four individual volunteers also were cited. 1993 Goal Exceeded 
United Way raised more money than it anticiipated in 1993. A look at its goals 
since 1988 compared to actual amounts donated, in millions: 1993 Goal: $18.5

WANTED: A BREAK IN MANHUNT; SEARCH: A YEAR AFTER OFFICER HOWARD DALLIES' 
SLAYING, GARDEN GROVE POLICE STILL SEEKING CULPRIT. CHIEF ANNOUNCES REWARD FOR 
CAPTURE HAS BEEN INCREASED TO $100,000.

<P>
 The yearlong investigation into the slaying of police officer Howard E. 
Dallies has not led authorities to his killer, but their work on the case has 
resulted in the arrests of more than 100 people for unrelated crimes, police 
said Wednesday at a news conference held on the first anniversary of the 
officer's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we cannot report that we have made an arrest," said Police 
Chief Stanley L. Knee, who announced that the reward for the killer's capture 
has been increased to $100,000. "Obviously, not having the murderer in custody 
adds a sense of frustration for members of this department and anxiety for the 
community as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 12 months, investigators have followed up on more than 3,200 leads 
from throughout the nation, including tips from New York and Florida, as well 
as from Canada and Mexico, said Sgt. Doug Morrell, the lead investigator in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leads that we tracked down nationwide have brought us different pieces of 
information that we may be able to use in the future," Morrell said. "However, 
the one or two crucial pieces of evidence that would be required to link the 
killer to the crime are still missing." 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to say what crucial evidence they lack and would not comment on 
the details of their investigation. They have heavily publicized the case, 
passing out thousands of flyers, providing a toll-free phone line for tips and 
dramatizing the case on television's "America's Most Wanted" program. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they have a description of a man they believe to be Dallies' 
killer, but have been unable to identify him. Dallies' killer is believed to be 
the same man who shot a uniformed security guard on Jan. 19, 1993, in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim in that shooting provided police with information for a composite 
drawing that continues to be widely circulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday was an emotional day for Mary Dallies, the slain officer's 
29-year-old widow, who was present at the news conference outside the Garden 
Grove Police Department. She also attended an earlier middle-of-the night 
memorial service in the 10100 block of Aldgate Avenue, the quiet residential 
street where her husband was gunned down by a motorcyclist at close range. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial service, held at 2:45 a.m. -- the time Howard Dallies was shot 
last March 9 -- was attended by more than 60 police officers and the Dallies' 
sons, Christopher, 8, and Scott, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very difficult year," Mary Dallies said through tears at the news 
conference. "It's been an adjustment for all of us. The kids and I are having a 
very difficult time, today especially. We're trying to start a new life and 
taking it one day at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Dallies said she and her family are hoping the increase in the reward 
will lead to the killer's capture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe someone who is motivated by the money will come forward and help bring 
this to a close," she said. The Dallies met on the graveyard shift at the 
Garden Grove Police Department, where she worked as a dispatcher, and were 
married in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Dallies was a nine-year member of the department when he was killed by 
a bullet that tore through his stomach, just below the bulletproof vest that 
officers are required to wear. He did not radio his position during the 
encounter with the motorcyclist or call in a description of the vehicle, 
contrary to the Police Department's policy. Police recovered the stolen 
motorcycle used by the gunman the same day as the shooting but they have yet to 
recover the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Dallies is one of nine Southland police officers killed in the line of 
duty since February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Dallies, who now works as a dispatcher for the Irvine Police Department, 
said she has been haunted by the deaths of the other officers, including that 
of rookie Los Angeles Police Officer Christy Hamilton, who was shot Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I hear about a new shooting, it just reopens the wound," she said. 
"It hurts all over again like it just happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Flags at the Garden Grove Civic Center were flown at half-staff Wednesday, 
just as they had been a year ago when Dallies became the fifth Garden Grove 
officer to die while on duty in a little more than three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "That was probably the blackest morning of my life," Knee said. "Certainly 
without apprehending a suspect, there is no closure to this open wound." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that although many of the leads in the case have turned out to be 
dead-ends, investigators have numerous other leads that they continue to 
pursue. "We've talked to thousands of people," Morrell said. "It's possible 
that we may have talked to someone who may know something." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, police have arrested more than 100 people on suspicion of 
theft, burglary, drug possession and vehicle theft, Morrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect in the composite is described as a white male, 20 to 25 years old, 
between 5 feet, 8 inches, and 6 feet tall, who weighs 160 to 180 pounds. He was 
clean-shaven, with blue eyes and pimples on both cheeks. At the time of the 
Santa Ana shooting, the suspect had light blond hair worn in a ponytail past 
his shoulders. He was wearing light blue jeans, a denim jacket and a denim 
baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information is asked to call the Garden Grove police at (800) 
404-4888.

PREHISTORIC PLAYGROUND; EXHIBIT LETS SCHOOL KIDS GO SNOUT TO NOSE WITH LIFELIKE 
DINOSAURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Sean Carson swept aside the wood chips covering the buried fossils, working as 
a paleontologist would for his first glimpse of a dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's footprints!" he exclaimed, as a hooked toe and claw emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson was among about 40 kindergartners from the St. Jeanne de Lestonnac 
School in Tustin who visited the one-day-only preview of a new life-size 
exhibit of baby dinosaurs manufactured by Dinamation International Corp. of 
Irvine. The exhibit makes its national debut at the Houston Zoo this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, geared to children ages 3 to 8 and on display at Dinamation's 
plant in Tustin, features 17 life-size robotic dinosaurs, including a 
15-foot-tall parasaurolophus, who bellows like a fog horn and guards her nest 
of newly hatched chicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Children can make dinosaur tracks in the sand, sculpt animals from modeling 
clay and piece together dinosaur puzzles in the hands-on exhibit, Dinamation 
spokeswoman Wendy Keiper said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the sandstorm display, 6-year-old Brianna Graves fanned a pile of Styrofoam 
pellets over dinosaur remains and learned how bones became covered with layers 
of dust.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew they had such things as sandstorms," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes with the whirling pellets, she raced to the tyrannosaurus 
rex display. "He's cool. He's the boss of it," she said, pointing to the king 
of the dinosaurs, who roared and played with a fat green triceratops.  
</P>
<P>
 While some children flitted from critter to critter, others were mesmerized by 
the modeling clay they used to shape dinosaur bones and nests full of eggs. 
Others rubbed etchings of dinosaurs from metal plates, practicing a skill that 
paleontologists use in the field in taking images of fossils and skin imprints. 
 
</P>
<P>
 At the front of the display, children played with a dinosaur who was cut in 
half, revealing his mechanical innards. By moving a lever one way, the dinosaur 
moved his mouth; with another flick of the lever, he moved his arms.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said something!" 4-year-old Gus Ellis whispered as he jerked the mouth of 
the dinosaur open and closed.  
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit demonstrates the family life of young dinosaurs, and comes with 
pasteboard stories parents can use to explain the behavior of the ancient 
reptiles in simple terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideas are simple, but part of the purpose is to involve parents in their 
children's learning, paleontologist George Callison said.  
</P>
<P>
 One display features a huge, winged dinosaur-dad feeding fish to his hungry 
chicks.  
</P>
<P>
 Another shows a baby apatosaurus playing with a tree full of winged, 
pointy-nosed dinosaurs, and a spiked-back giant lizard. The story says that the 
young dinosaurs, at first frightened of each other, are now friends. 
</P>
<P>
 And one display reminds children that although the tyrannosaurus rex once 
ruled Earth, the humble, tiny turtles that lived alongside him are the ones 
that survived the ravages of geologic time.  
</P>
<P>
 Dinamation began manufacturing the large, scientifically accurate beasts in 
1983 to increase interest in science among schoolchildren while providing a fun 
introduction to paleontology, Keiper said. "We're trying to add scientists to 
the list of heroes for children," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The company usually makes adult-sized dinosaurs and rents them to zoos, 
museums and aquariums, Keiper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prehistoric Playground is the first time Dinamation has manufactured an 
entire exhibit, including educational stories. The company isn't planning to 
exhibit the display in Orange County because there are no appropriate museums 
for it here, Keiper said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, parents were happy their kids had the chance to see the 
creatures.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; COUNCIL CANDIDATES DISCUSS CITY'S WOES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The eight candidates vying for seats on the City Council discussed the city's 
financial situation, crime and the future of Main Street at a forum this week 
sponsored by the League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in three of the city's five council districts will go to the polls 
March 29 to elect representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 1, which covers the Old Town area, Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce 
Hastings faces businessman James Klisanin and community activist Charles Antos. 
In District 3, which covers the Marina Hill area, Mayor Gwen Forsythe is 
running against Main Street merchant John Baker and resident Kathy Parker. In 
District 5, which covers Leisure World, Councilman William J. Doane faces 
engineer Richard Davies. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's financial troubles were the subject of much discussion at the forum 
at City Hall. Several candidates criticized incumbents for doubling the 
utility-users tax last year as a way of balancing the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Leisure World, we have an awful lot of people on fixed incomes. This tax 
takes money out of people's pockets," said Davies, adding that the tax should 
be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsythe and the other incumbents defended the tax, saying it was the only way 
to offset a $2-million budget shortfall without making large cuts in police and 
other city services. They said the tax will be reviewed each year and could be 
phased out as the city's financial health improves. 
</P>
<P>
 Doane said the city could increase revenue by putting parking meters on Main 
Street and using the city's jail to house prisoners from surrounding cities. 
Antos added that the city should bill state and federal officials for the costs 
of city programs they mandate but don't pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates also suggested a number of ideas for improving the Main Street 
business district. Baker said the city should use a parking lot near the Seal 
Beach Pier for customer parking. He also suggested that the city do more to 
repair buckled sidewalks along Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Klisanin said the city could work with merchants to improve the look of the 
street by adding new lighting, benches and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of crime, Parker said the city should establish police foot 
patrols in certain areas and use volunteers to write parking tickets. Hastings 
said she favors opening a police substation on the pier, which would add a 
constant police presence to the Old Town area. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; 1 DIES, 2 OTHERS HURT IN APARTMENT FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman died in an apartment fire early Wednesday as she sought protection by 
turning on the shower and covering herself with a sheet, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze in a two-story apartment building on the 200 block of Avenida Aragon 
also sent two men to the hospital with minor burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the fire started about 4:30 a.m. in the bedroom of a unit. 
The cause was "discarded smoking material that ignited the bedding," said 
Battalion Chief Bill Bundy. He said it appeared to be an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze destroyed a big section of the apartment and damaged at least one 
other unit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said two men who were in the same apartment as the victim were 
taken to Samaritan Medical Center-San Clemente, where one of them was treated 
for minor burns and injuries, as well as smoke inhalation. He was not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The other man, Alan Ostedahl, 43, was transferred from Samaritan to Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where he was treated for 
minor burns and released, hospital spokeswoman Wendy Harle said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third man living at the apartment managed to escape unscathed, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor said the dead woman, whom authorities won't identify until 
relatives are notified, was visiting the apartment and wasn't a tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the Fisherman's Restaurant at the San Clemente Pier, where the 
woman had been working as a waitress for more than three months, were in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was super-sweet, really nice," said one employee. "She was half Cherokee 
. . . a Native American. She had long, dark hair and was always cheerful." 
</P>
<P>
 The employees said police asked them not to identify their dead co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Novello, district manager of the Fisherman's restaurant chain, said the 
woman was "a good employee, always on time, a good person." FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; FREE CLINIC FOR CHILDREN LAUNCHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patti Tyler is a school nurse, but her job isn't to see the children who have 
scraped knees or cut lips on the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler runs the Anaheim City School District's Health Clinic for Children, 
which opened Tuesday at Paul Revere Elementary School. The clinic will offer 
free health exams and other medical services to poor and moderate-income 
students from the district's 21 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of treating sick children, the clinic's three-person staff will do 
physical exams on apparently healthy children to make sure they do not have any 
undiscovered diseases or problems. The students will receive vaccinations, 
tuberculosis screenings, blood and urine tests, and eye and hearing exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason this clinic is needed is that a lot of our children do not have 
real good access to medical care," said Tyler, a registered nurse and pediatric 
nurse practitioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many of our children and their parents, it is a real problem to pay for 
medical care or to go to the clinics in Santa Ana," Tyler said. "By opening up 
a clinic in the schools, hopefully more of the students will have access to 
health care. And we will find problems before they become bigger and more 
costly to treat." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic's budget of $100,000 annually is funded primarily by the state's 
Medi-Cal system; about half of the district's 17,000 students come from 
families whose incomes make them eligible for the clinic's services. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic has a waiting room, two partitioned examining rooms and a rack of 
pamphlets for parents describing various children's health problems in English 
and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 When an examination or testing reveals a health problem, the child will be 
referred to a physician for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler also hopes to talk to parents while their children are being examined, 
to gauge what they know about children's health issues and give them some basic 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be surprised, but some parents do not know how to use a thermometer or 
read one," Tyler said. "We want to teach them the basics about nutrition, 
dental care, seat belts, the danger of riding in the back of pickup trucks -- 
all of the things that could impact their child's health." TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; SCHOOL DISTRICT JOINS WAR ON TV VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brea Olinda Unified School District this week joined the battle against 
violence on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees adopted a resolution supporting the national Citizens Task Force on 
TV Violence in its call for federal action against violent television programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force wants the U.S. attorney general to consider seven 
recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 * Adoption of a code that would prohibit gratuitous violence in programming 
between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowing parents to control what their children watch on television by 
installing mechanical or electronic devices that would block out violent 
programming and to help develop a violence rating system. 
</P>
<P>
 * That the Federal Communications Commission conduct hearings on possible 
voluntary and regulatory solutions to television violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Strengthening the Federal Children's Television Act by increasing 
"beneficial programming for children." 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminating violent television programs in prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Calling for a White House conference on violence to focus on the causes of 
the "nation's epidemic of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 * Calling for television industry discussions to "identify, control and reduce 
violent programming." 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Edgar Z. Seal said even violent television cartoons encourage 
youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited a recent Cal State Fullerton study that concluded that allowing 
children to watch "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," a cartoon about spandex-clad 
super heroes who use karate chops and magic swords to conquer monsters, can be 
dangerous. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA YORBA LINDA; SCHOOL BOARD SPLITS OVER TV 
VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A resolution decrying violence on television sparked a rare dispute Tuesday 
among members of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District Board of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 While four of his colleagues applauded Resolution 120, which in part calls for 
the Federal Communications Commission to ban "gratuitous, dramatized violence" 
on television from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., Trustee William Kielty attacked it as 
"tap-dancing around censorship." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want (the government) deciding for me what is gratuitous violence," 
Kielty said, adding that blaming television violence for social problems is 
abdicating personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us grew up with a lot of (television) violence," Kielty said. "I 
honestly don't believe that had much influence" on violence in society. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Jerry Brakebill, a detective with the Brea Police Department and 
former DARE officer, said he "couldn't disagree more" with Kielty's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess because of the work I do, I strongly support Resolution 120," 
Brakebill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most decisions before the board are made unanimously, and trustees seldom 
publicly disagree with one another. But Brakebill and Craig Olson strongly 
supported regulating violence on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't have the right to put things into my home that may harm 
children," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution lists seven recommendations for curbing the number of violent 
acts depicted on television, including the establishment of an entertainment 
media violence code, which would prohibit gratuitous violence on programming 
shown before 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Other steps recommended are a violence rating system, viewer warnings and 
development of devices to block out specific programs. The resolution calls for 
a ban on the viewing of violent programs in prison and strengthening the 
Children's Television Act to require more educational programming.  
</P>
<P>
 Supt. James O. Fleming said the resolution was sent to him by the state Board 
of Education and he recommended that the Placentia-Yorba Linda board approve it 
based on the state's endorsement and because he personally agrees with many of 
the provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that violence on television and in the movies desensitizes kids to 
real-life violence," Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that passing the resolution is essentially no more than a 
gesture, Fleming said he is pleased by the board's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't do something now, what will society be like in 10 years?" Fleming 
said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; APPEAL PLANNED ON ANNEXATION RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will appeal a recent ruling allowing county officials to block the 
city's attempt at annexing unincorporated North Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 At its meeting Tuesday, the City Council directed City Atty. Lois E. Jeffrey 
to seek reversal of the Orange County Superior Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the ruling is contrary to the law as it pertains to annexations," 
Jeffrey told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Judge Eileen C. Moore determined that county officials acted 
legally when they refused an offer that would have moved the city closer to its 
annexation goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since gaining cityhood in 1991, Laguna Hills has sought to expand its 
boundaries to the north, where furniture stores and other businesses provide a 
steady flow of sales-tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills officials offered to let the county continue collecting property 
taxes from the area so the annexation would not completely deplete another 
revenue source from the county's budget. But the county declined, saying it 
also wanted a share of the area's sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city went to court, claiming that annexation laws required it only to 
negotiate property-tax revenue with the county. And since it had offered to 
turn over 100% of the property tax, the city argued, nothing was left to 
negotiate and the county was legally required to approve an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ruled that while the city was correct in not having to negotiate 
anything beyond property taxes, the county still could block the annexation for 
other reasons. The judge also agreed with county attorneys' arguments that the 
city had not followed proper procedures in negotiating with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, unless the county and city come to an agreement, the city 
cannot plead its case before the Local Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The city wants to annex the 722-acre area, whose 4,600 residents voted more 
than four years ago to be part of the new city of Laguna Hills. Because of 
objections from the county, LAFCO did not allow North Laguna Hills to be 
included when Laguna Hills incorporated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The area annually generates about $600,000 in property taxes and $2.3 million 
in sales and other taxes for the county while requiring about $540,000 in costs 
for law enforcement, planning, animal control and other services, according to 
the county auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's sales-tax revenue is particularly lucrative because it includes 
numerous stores concentrated along a street commonly called "furniture row." 
The proposed annexation area is bounded by Interstate 5, Ridge Route Drive, 
Santa Maria Avenue, Moulton Parkway and the city of Irvine. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; YOUTH LEADER HELD IN MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 28-year-old youth group leader at a church has been arrested on suspicion of 
molesting four boys between 1991 and 1993, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Webb Blinkhorn of Reseda was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of 18 
felony counts of child molestation, according to Corinne Loomis of the 
Placentia Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Loomis said that Blinkhorn's arrest came after a monthlong investigation. 
Loomis said that Blinkhorn met the four youths, who ranged in age from 12 to 
15, while working as a "core group leader," a voluntary position, at the 
Evangelical Free Church in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinkhorn turned himself in at County Jail Tuesday and was being held on 
$75,000 bail, jail officials said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; STOP-GAP TROUPE FIGHTS CLOSED MINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They brood onstage, moving deliberately and silently. Then, with a burst, the 
three actors fire off their lines at an audience of teen-agers at Valley Vista 
High School in Fountain Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 " They're all standing around on street corners," says one actor. " They come 
in and buy things," complains another. "Why can't they live like us ," the 
third actor gripes. 
</P>
<P>
 The threesome are part of Stop-Gap, a Santa Ana-based theater group that uses 
drama to educate young adults and children about issues such as racial 
prejudice. About 30 actors perform with the troupe and present plays to about 
600 elementary, middle and high school classes in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties each year.  
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday morning, the team presented a play about ethnic diversity before 
about 100 students at the Fountain Valley continuation school. The performance 
was funded through a grant from Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our demographics are changing and diversity is increasing, so it's becoming a 
big issue in this (school) district," said Terri Bovberg, a Valley Vista 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school is part of the Huntington Beach Union High School District, 
which has a student population that is 80% white, 11% Latino and 8% Asian 
American, according to fall, 1993, statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Bovberg has invited the nonprofit drama group to bring its act to the school 
in the past. Sometimes Stop-Gap discusses sexual assault; often its skits touch 
on substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids like to see theater," Bovberg said. "They're so used to going to 
movies, and our kids need to visualize issues." 
</P>
<P>
 A short drama, "Use My Real Name," told the story of a boy who immigrates to 
Orange County with his family and discovers prejudice as he grows up. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Jaime Ferrar stood on stage, playing a 10-year-old who talked excitedly 
about moving to an apartment in Irvine, Costa Mesa or San Clemente, among other 
cities. But a landlord, played by D Renee Brooks, steered his family instead to 
other cities, which have large Latino and Asian populations. "I think you'd 
feel more comfortable there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the play, actor Robert Knapp asked the students to think about what can 
be done about prejudice and where it comes from.  
</P>
<P>
 Students raised their hands. "Parents," a few said. "Television," said others, 
who also mentioned friends and fear of people who are "different."  
</P>
<P>
 The actors solicited student volunteers to improvise roles in racial 
discussions. It was Valley Vista student Lee Allen's turn to take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen stood up from the audience and assumed the role of the stern father of 
Ferrar's character, a Latino boy who got into a fight with a black girl at 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 "That girl, she gets on my nerves, Dad," Ferrar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was not at a loss for words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you get on my nerves, too, son," Allen said, sending laughter through 
the ranks of his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen talked to the actors after the performance ended, because he wants to 
break into drama. He has performed in school plays, he said, and is interested 
in Stop-Gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it because racial discussions aren't stressed as much as they should 
be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Bryan, who co-founded Stop-Gap in 1979, said the theater group is now 
developing an interactive play that will help teen-agers develop their ability 
to make decisions in tough situations.  
</P>
<P>
 "As opposed to reading something or hearing a lecture, theater reaches our 
emotions," Bryan said. "We empathize with characters. Drama touches us. If 
something arouses strong feeling in you, you retain that for the rest of your 
life." ALICIA DI RADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY WILL REGULATE 3-FOOT CABLE BOXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city plans to regulate the hundreds of 3-foot-tall metal boxes that 
Dimension Cable has been installing on grassy public easements throughout 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently directed officials to inspect the boxes for safety 
and asked Dimension Cable to place identification labels on each box so that 
residents know who owns them. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also asked officials to develop safety and aesthetic standards 
that will regulate the future placement of such devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The action comes in response to numerous complaints by residents who said the 
boxes are ugly and degrade the look of the community. In many cases, the 
green-colored devices were placed without warning on front lawns and other 
city-owned open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents also have raised safety concerns about the boxes, saying 
children could fall while climbing on them and that drivers might accidentally 
run over them when backing out of driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension Cable started installing the boxes last year as part of an effort to 
upgrade the quality of cable service in the city. The new technology will 
provide residents with more channels and clearer reception, said Mark Stucky, 
general manager of Dimension Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Stucky did not object to the proposed regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes contain sensitive electronic equipment that cannot be placed 
underground because moisture could damage the fiber-optic cables, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members expressed sympathy for residents but said there was little the 
city could do because Irvine's franchise agreement with Dimension allows the 
company to use easements for providing cable service. 
</P>
<P>
 But public outcry did prompt the council late last year to ask the city's Ad 
Hoc Cable Committee to look into the issue. The committee held two public 
hearings and two weeks ago released a report. 
</P>
<P>
 The council reviewed the report in late February and adopted several of the 
committee's recommendations, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * The city inspection of all cable boxes to make sure the electrical equipment 
does not pose a hazard to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * The establishment of specific standards for aboveground boxes that would 
take into account aesthetic and visual issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * The labeling by Dimension of all cable boxes with identification tags that 
include a telephone number residents can call with questions and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The council rejected a proposal that would have given residents a two-month 
period to make formal complaints about boxes near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, officials said residents should direct any concerns they have about 
the devices to Dimension Cable, which is owned by Times Mirror Inc., the parent 
company of the Los Angeles Times. In some cases, Dimension has agreed to move 
the boxes away from homes. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY PASSES OUT $64,000 TO 9 GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday awarded nine county fund grants totaling 
$64,000, with $50,000 going to a Buena Park recreation program. The eight other 
grants are to be shared by nonprofit community groups countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50,000 for the Boys and Girls Club of Buena Park comes from the urban 
park fund and will go toward an ongoing renovation of the club's youth 
recreation clubhouse near Peak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will help with a major overhaul of the building, which needs new 
doors, windows and flooring, club executive director Jean Morgan said. The 
remodeling began two years ago, but the work has gone slowly because the club 
was short of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really is like a dream come true for us," Morgan said. "In electrical 
work alone, we have $15,000 to $20,000 worth of things that need to be done. 
Now they will be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buena Park group, one of the county's 15 Boys and Girls clubs, offers 
programs to more than 1,250 youngsters. Many of the children who participate 
are from single-parent or low-income families, and those youngsters especially 
benefit from the club's daily, upbeat influence, said Supervisor William G. 
Steiner, who recommended the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The other eight grants approved Tuesday, for social services, will benefit a 
group of programs to aid the county's disadvantaged, disabled or distressed 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the other grants, $5,000, went to Friends of the Court 
Appointed Advocates, a group that supports advocacy programs for abused or 
neglected children who are going through the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County chapter of the National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children received $2,500, while the Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter of Costa 
Mesa was given $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Grants of $1,000 each went to the Boys and Girls Club of Tustin; Family 
Solutions, an Orange-based program that assists and houses abused children; the 
Homeless Intervention and Shelter House in Placentia; Paint Your Heart Out 
Anaheim, a campaign to help upgrade low-income homes in disrepair, and the 
Youth Employment Services of the Harbor Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors each year awards about 50 social services grants to 
county charity groups, ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 each. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY BACKS FEE CUT FOR PROJECT APPLICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved a plan to reduce fees for routine 
applications for business or home construction projects filed with the 
Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously Monday to decrease fees by as much as 50% for 
applications that can be processed quickly, such as requests for extensions on 
building or renovation projects that could not be finished as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to encourage people (to build or expand), especially in this 
economy," Mayor Jim Potts said. "The entrepreneurs provide the tax dollars. We 
don't want us to be the cause for them to fail." 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing will be held, perhaps as early as March 21, to consider the 
fee reductions, according to Rita Westfield, the city's assistant community 
development director. A council resolution would be necessary to enact the 
changes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, businesses and homeowners pay the same amount for plan changes or 
revisions as they do when they apply for a project for the first time. 
Applicants also pay the full amount for extension requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, applicants would pay $350 instead of $665 for minor 
changes such as changing the external color of a proposed building or adding a 
rack to display more merchandise inside a store. 
</P>
<P>
 A flat $250 fee is also being considered for extension requests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is also considering a draft ordinance that would 
create the position of zoning administrator, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a zoning administrator, certain application fees could be reduced by as 
much as 85%, because that official could help cut red tape, said Assistant City 
Manager Christine Shingleton. She said the ordinance could go before the 
council in 30 to 45 days. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SUPERVISOR RILEY RETURNS TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley returned to work 
Wednesday, two weeks after undergoing back surgery to remove a cyst in his 
spine that had caused severe leg pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The 81-year-old retired Marine Corps general spent his first day back meeting 
with fellow supervisors and transportation officials, and reading stacks of 
mail that had accumulated during his absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great, I've had a very good recovery," Riley said after seven hours of 
work. "I went to see my doctor on Monday and he was surprised that I was active 
so soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley worked without the assistance of a walking device that he had used 
during rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "His first day back went real well, he seems to have made a good recovery," 
said Christie McDaniel, an aide to the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the surgery at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, Riley had been confined 
to a wheelchair for about two months for an unrelated foot infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Chairman Gaddi H. Vasquez filled in for Riley during his absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, who plans to retire when his term expires next year, has been 5th 
District supervisor since 1974.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ASSEMBLYWOMAN TO BE HONORED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) is scheduled to be honored today as the 
county's Legislator of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Los Alamitos and Westminster nominated Allen for the award 
because they said she supports local government and is responsive to city and 
district concerns.The cities also lauded Allen for her opposition to the 
state's shifting of property-tax revenue away from local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities rely on property taxes, which are collected by the state and 
redistributed. In recent years, the state has given cities a smaller amount of 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a 14-year member of the Assembly, said she will continue fighting to 
keep property taxes flowing back to cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen serves on the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee, which rules on the 
state budget. She also sits on the Education Committee and the Natural 
Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's division of the League of California Cities is scheduled to 
recognize Allen today at a meeting. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH COSTA MESA; BUDGET FOR SCHOOLS INCLUDES 
RESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District is accomplishing something this year 
that it has not managed in almost a decade: Its operating budget for the 
current school year includes a 3% reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not sound like a big achievement, but for a district that suffered 
through a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal in 1992 and spent millions 
this year to reduce the class ratio by about two students per teacher, it is 
cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this is somewhat of a historical occasion for us," district Supt. 
Mac Bernd told the small gathering of parents and teachers at Tuesday's school 
board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $88-million budget for the 1993-94 school year, about $2.6 million is 
being kept in reserve to comply with state mandates. In the past, the district 
has used endowment money or proceeds from the sale of district property to plug 
shortfalls in reserves, school board President Edward H. Decker said. He added 
that the reserves are an indication of the district's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great news," Decker said about meeting the reserve-fund mandate. 
"Especially since we have not been in compliance for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget report will be filed with the county by Tuesday. BOB ELSTON

ICE RINK SITE COULD NET FUNDS FOR KOLL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim and the Walt Disney Co. have selected a downtown site for 
a proposed jointly built ice rink that could be a major boost for the Koll 
Center office complex next door. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink, which would serve as a practice site for the Mighty Ducks hockey 
team, would be built on a three-acre parcel at the southwest corner of Lincoln 
Avenue and Clementine Street under the preliminary proposal outlined to the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the city and Disney are planning to enter negotiations to see how the 
costs of the complex would be divided, said Community Development Director 
Elisa Stipkovich. Although details must be worked out, the basic concept calls 
for the city to contribute the land and for Disney to pay for the building. 
</P>
<P>
 A Disney Development Co. spokeswoman said she could not comment on the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 A major beneficiary of a deal would be the Koll Co., which envisions the 
Disney ice rink as the magnet that could draw shoppers to stores within its 
adjacent Koll Center Anaheim. Although the center is well developed as an 
office complex, the ice rink could help spark further retail development there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of many people you would rather work with than Disney," said 
Richard M. Ortwein, president of the Koll Real Estate Group in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll relinquished its development rights to the three-acre site as its part of 
the deal. In return, the rink could make the site a popular meeting place even 
though it is not close to any freeways. "We have to have a reason for people to 
come," Ortwein said, and ice skating could be one. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney sees the ice rink as not only a training site for the Mighty Ducks, but 
also as a center that could be used to interest youths -- many of them from 
disadvantaged neighborhoods -- in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will involve youth, the community and hockey," said Kenneth P. Wong, 
senior vice president for Disney Development, last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink issue was brought Tuesday before the City Council so it could 
formally approve Koll's relinquishment of its development right on the 
three-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks have been practicing at the Glacial Garden Ice Arena in 
Anaheim, a two-rink facility that opened about 15 months ago. Managers have 
said they would love to keep the team but say Disney officials have complained 
that its ceiling is too low.

FEDCO BANNED FROM SELLING KNIFE-PEN DEVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining order 
Wednesday prohibiting 10 Southern California Fedco stores from selling writing 
pens that contain a small, hidden blade. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a 15-minute hearing, Judge Richard Frazee ordered Fedco, the chain's 
Shaver Shops and Remington Products Co., which operates the shops as a 
concession, to stop selling the pens. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complaint filed Monday, the Orange County district attorney's office 
charged the devices, called Classic Pen Knives, are concealed weapons, 
specifically banned by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The knife portion of the device is a fixed, single-edged, pointed blade, 2 1/2 
inches long. It is exposed by removing the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, within hours of a civil complaint filed by the district attorney's 
Consumer Protection Unit, Fedco officials ordered the pen knives removed from 
store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applaud their taking immediate action," said Robert C. Gannon Jr., the 
unit's supervising deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge suggested, but did not order, that Fedco stores in Costa Mesa and 
Buena Park surrender the products to local police or ship them out of state. 
Frazee scheduled a hearing on a preliminary restraining order for March 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Gannon hailed the judge's action, saying "the court's order addresses the 
primary public safety issue, which is keeping these illegal weapons out of the 
hands of the public, and stopping further distribution of concealed weapons. It 
also protects the public from possibly being arrested for a felony offense for 
having these items in their possession."

METALS FIRM FACES $253,300 EPA PENALTY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A metals manufacturing firm specializing in aerospace components is facing a 
possible $253,300 penalty for improperly storing hazardous waste, the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Zelikson, the EPA's hazardous waste division director in San Francisco, 
said the penalty was proposed against Hightower Plating & Manufacturing Corp., 
in the 200 block of North Glassell Street, which produces washers for the 
aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A company spokesman said Hightower would have no comment on the proposed 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Hightower, which also is known as Hightower Metal Products, is accused of 
violating several provisions of the state law which regulates the management of 
hazardous waste. The violations were found during an inspection of the facility 
by representatives of the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was cited for numerous violations, including storing hazardous 
waste without a permit and storing it in improper containers. In addition to 
the proposed penalty, Hightower must certify that it has corrected all past 
violations and that current operations comply with all requirements.

SPICE PROCESSING, PACKAGING INDUSTRY SPROUTING IN AMERICA'S HEARTLAND; FOODS: A 
CENTURY OF INNOVATIONS AND CHANGING TASTES HAVE MADE TONE BROTHERS A MAJOR 
PLAYER WITH MORE THAN $100 MILLION IN YEARLY SALES.

 Tons of paprika, cinnamon and oregano are transforming a stretch of central 
Iowa farmland that once grew plain corn and soybeans into a leading purveyor of 
palate stimulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The bales, bags and drums of piquant spices, in all about 700 raw ingredients, 
are shipped from abroad to a new $20-million plant built by Tone Brothers Inc., 
one of the fastest-growing companies in the food business. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant in Ankeny is the second spice-processing facility Tone has built in 
the Des Moines area in the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't necessarily see the Tone brand name in supermarkets outside the 
Midwest. But chances are you would see it if you shop at one of the discount 
warehouse clubs sprouting up around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 It's likely that Tone processed the cinnamon in your Sara Lee coffee cake. Its 
oversized cans of pepper and cumin powder adorn kitchen shelves of restaurants 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The spice business is hot. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to want a blast with every bite," says John McMillin, a food 
industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. McMillin projects the 
spice industry is growing at an annual rate of 5% or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Tone's goals, provided in a wallet-sized plastic card to each employee and 
framed on the wall of its chief executive, F. Christopher Cruger, seek more 
than 20% annual growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The company once was a pipsqueak in global spice trade. In 1980, when it 
mostly was a supplier to regional supermarket chains, sales totaled a modest $6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tone has prospered by parlaying more than a century of innovations into an 
international operation and more than $100 million in sales. How much more 
Cruger won't say. 
</P>
<P>
 He expresses reluctance to disclose anything that might help a competitor. In 
a recent interview with the Associated Press at his office, he demanded 
identification to ensure the visit wasn't an industrial spy's ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has good reason to be sensitive about its discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Tone introduced individual packaging of spices in the 1880s, ready-roasted 
unground coffee in the 1890s, tin cans for spices in the 1910s. 
</P>
<P>
 It invented pressure-packed cans for ground coffee in the 1940s and clear 
containers for spices in the 1980s, when it also developed a way to process 
spices at temperatures as low as 150 degrees below zero to retain volatile oils 
and preserve freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Cruger says Tone runs in the same exalted circles as such spice industry 
leaders as McCormick & Co. of Maryland; Burns, Philp & Co. of Australia; Fuchs, 
Gewuerze of Germany and Ducros of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruger, whose soft-spoken ways belie his 6-foot-6 frame, is credited with 
leading the surge. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to Tone in 1985 after a career selling soap, dog food and cake at such 
giants as Procter & Gamble, Quaker Oats and Sara Lee. He remained at the helm 
even after the 1989 purchase of Tone by Rykoff-Sexton Inc., a Los Angeles 
manufacturer and distributor of food products. 
</P>
<P>
 His style encourages teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees can question the company's every move at quarterly meetings. There 
are employee problem-solving teams. There is rare, genuine goodwill with the 
Teamsters union, which represents most of Tone's 430 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris has always been a gentleman," says Ron McClain, the vice president and 
business agent for Teamsters Local 147. 
</P>
<P>
 The union helped the company turn its fortunes around in the 1980s, when Tone 
had a problem filling orders and making timely deliveries. With the rebound, 
workers have been enjoying profit sharing that has swelled from $880,000 to 
almost $1.5 million in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers voted on what they wanted in the new plant in Ankeny, rejecting a 
day-care center but approving a cafeteria, which includes a patio and outside 
ornamental pond with fountain, and a fitness center with the latest in aerobic 
and muscle-conditioning gear. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we really are trying to achieve here is to provide a working environment 
where everybody feels that they're a contributor," Cruger says. The company's 
strength has been as a supplier to the restaurant and food service trade and in 
sales to the discount club warehouses that buy in enormous quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is focusing on the real sales leaders in the $2-billion to $3-billion 
U.S. spice market -- grocery chains and bulk deliveries to food companies. It 
also has developed markets outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in Des Moines in 1873 by Irish immigrant brothers Jehiel and I.E. 
Tone, Tone bases success partly on its unlikely Midwest base, about as far as 
possible from the ocean ports where Tone's raw materials arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 With 60% coming through New York and 40% from California, the goods meet in 
the nation's midsection. The spices are processed and packaged, then shipped 
directly to customers at home and abroad. There are no costly warehouse 
operations.

UCLA PSYCHIATRISTS REPRIMANDED OVER CLINICAL DRUG TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II and MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA psychiatrists were reprimanded by the National Institutes of Health on 
Wednesday for what the agency said was their failure to get proper informed 
consent from patients enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial of a new 
anti-schizophrenia drug.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the trial, many of the patients were taken off the drug to 
determine whether treatment was no longer necessary and, in the process, 23 of 
the 50 were reported to have suffered severe relapses, including hallucinations 
and paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the patients committed suicide and a second, Gregory Aller, has said 
that he threatened to kill both of his parents and attempted to go to 
Washington, D.C., to assassinate President George Bush at the order of space 
aliens.  
</P>
<P>
 The two young men's parents filed a complaint with NIH and that agency 
Wednesday sent the physicians involved, Dr. Michael Gitlin and Dr. Keith 
Nuechterlein of UCLA, a draft of its reprimand, although its contents have not 
yet been made public. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at NIH confirmed Wednesday that the UCLA researchers were faulted for 
their handling of so-called informed-consent procedures. "We have been 
investigating this particular study for some time, and we have sent the draft 
report to them, as is our procedure," said one NIH source. "They have a month 
to comment back to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did find some problems with the informed consent," the source said. "I 
think that was most of it, the biggest problem. Parents of some of the patients 
have been quite concerned about this study. This study was peer reviewed in 
order to get funded, and I think what the parents had problems with was this 
idea of their getting off the drug for a certain time, and not being informed 
about the possible consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear what penalties, if any, might be associated with the 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gitlin did not return phone calls Wednesday and Nuechterlein could not be 
reached. Both have denied repeatedly, however, that they have done anything 
unethical, and have argued that they could not discuss details of either of the 
two disputed cases until the parents or the patient sign a release allowing 
such discussion. The parents have not done so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't try to produce relapses," Gitlin told Time magazine last year. "They 
occur even as we try not to have them." The goal of the project, in fact, was 
to identify patients who could stop receiving the drug -- and thereby avoid its 
side effects -- and maintain the successes they had achieved with it.  
</P>
<P>
 Schizophrenia, which affects more than 1% of the U.S. population by some 
estimates, is characterized by delusions, hallucinations, depression and 
inability to think clearly. It is treated with a variety of drugs, but none of 
them have been entirely successful. The UCLA team has been studying a drug 
called Prolixin, which provides dramatic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Aller had been troubled most of his life, Aller and his father Robert 
have acknowledged in the past, but his symptoms worsened when he enrolled in 
college at UC Santa Barbara. He stopped attending classes and flunked out with 
straight Fs. He ran for office, attempted to go into business and was arrested 
for false advertising. Meanwhile, he has said he was regularly seeing the ghost 
of his dead grandmother, listening to aliens tell him that President Bush must 
be removed from office and hiding from a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
 When he enrolled in the UCLA study in 1988, he began receiving the drug 
intravenously twice a month. Within three months, all his symptoms were gone. 
He maintained a 3.7 grade point average at Santa Monica College, worked in 
marketing research 15 hours a week and was on course to go into an advanced 
scholar's program at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Gitlin and Nuechterlein took him off the drug to see if he could get 
along without it. Although he apparently convinced the researchers that he 
didn't need it any more, his personal life deteriorated rapidly, provoking 
bitter confrontations between the doctors and his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Greg Aller was taken to a private psychiatrist for further 
treatment with Prolixin and his condition is improving, although he is able to 
attend classes only part-time and his grade average is only 2.8.

LIBRARY PICKS UP THE PIECES, 1 VOLUME AT A TIME; RECOVERY: SHERMAN OAKS BRANCH 
STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS HAVE RESHELVED 30,000 BOOKS KNOCKED OFF BY THE QUAKE -- 
AND HAVE 7,000 MORE TO GO.

 Jane Austen is back on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Emile Zola still has some time. 
</P>
<P>
 In just one week, staff members and volunteers of the Sherman Oaks Branch 
Library have reshelved nearly 30,000 books hurled to the floor by the Jan. 17 
earthquake -- and have only about 7,000 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 With eight staff members and an average of five volunteers daily, that works 
out to more than 2,300 books per person.  
</P>
<P>
 They began the task on March 2 after construction workers had bolted and 
bracketed most of the 195 stacks to the floors and walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 90% of the library's 42,000 books came tumbling down, the card 
catalogue remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The library sustained no structural damage, but 1,000 paperback books were 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the scheduled reopening on Monday, workers expect to be finished reshelving 
the remainder of the books, including sections G through Z in adult fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big, thick books are easier," said Shari Feinberg-Uhlenberg, an out-of-work 
television production assistant. "The tiny, thin little books -- you work for 
hours and don't have much to show for what you've done because they're so 
small." 
</P>
<P>
 The library's patrons have mostly been using the Studio City branch, which 
reopened within two weeks of the quake. Several patrons left word with the 
Studio City branch that they were available for volunteer work when it was time 
to reopen their library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have such nice patrons here," said Alice Feinberg, a 16-year library 
assistant who has been with the Sherman Oaks branch for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "One man has promised to bring flowers to fill up the library when we reopen," 
Feinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vi Cooper, 75, a longtime Sherman Oaks volunteer, has been spending five hours 
a day reordering the library's shelf list -- an index card list of all the 
books and the cost of each book. It had been housed in wooden index boxes like 
the card catalogue, but did not fare as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of (the cards) will always have reminders of the earthquake on them 
because of the footprints," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were scattered so that the construction workers couldn't really get 
around them," Cooper said.

ASBESTOS WORK AT UNIVERSAL SOUND STAGES IS INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State job safety and air quality officials are investigating allegations of 
illegal asbestos work at Universal City Studios, where film production crews 
say they have endured clouds of irritating dust during earthquake repairs to 
asbestos-containing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigations by the South Coast Air Quality Management District and 
state Division of Occupational Safety and Health stem from complaints about 
demolition of sound stage walls that in some cases contain asbestos insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, studio officials for weeks after the Jan. 17 quake 
deployed construction workers with crowbars and sledgehammers to shatter the 
stucco walls, creating storms of plaster dust and allowing the crumbly 
insulation to escape the walls and tumble to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for MCA Inc., Universal's parent company, said the firm has 
taken "every precaution possible." Spokeswoman Christine Hanson said, "In all 
places that we knew there was asbestos, we handled it properly." 
</P>
<P>
 However, after weeks of growing distrust of company safety assurances, film 
crew members last week hired a private lab to test the insulation and learned 
it contained asbestos. The film workers, who spoke on the condition that they 
would not be identified, said they then called both Cal/OSHA, the state job 
safety agency, and the air district, which have since sent inspectors to the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Film crew members -- seven of whom provided The Times with detailed accounts 
-- said they were furious because studio officials previously had issued 
notices on the location of asbestos, indicating that the company was aware of 
the asbestos in the sound stage walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the workers contended, no precautions were taken to hold down 
dust or contain and dispose of the debris during weeks of smashing the walls.  
</P>
<P>
 Insulation containing asbestos was "cascading out of the walls, . . . and it 
was left in huge piles two feet high, and shoveled into open dumpsters," one 
angry worker said. "This went on for six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those raising concerns was actor Roy Scheider, star of the television 
show "seaQuest DSV," which is filmed on several of the sound stages. "My fears 
were the same as the rest of the crew," Scheider said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheider, who spoke out at a meeting last Friday between studio officials and 
the "seaQuest" cast and crew, said company representatives told him they were 
"tripling (their) efforts to see that these sound stages are safe. . . . They 
don't want anyone saying they don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 However, MCA officials said the company handled the situation correctly, and 
relied on the advice of asbestos consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have located some asbestos, and each time that we find it we remove it and 
contain it," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Cal/OSHA -- which regulates worker exposure to asbestos -- and 
for the air district -- which is concerned with asbestos releases to the 
general environment -- said they are in the beginning stages of their 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking into whether or not they're complying with our rule that 
applies to asbestos demolition," said air district spokesman Sam Atwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that if there were violations, the demolition contractor would 
share liability. Hanson said late Wednesday she did not know who the contractor 
was. 
</P>
<P>
 Widely used in insulation and other building materials, asbestos is safe when 
intact. But when pulverized or broken, it can release tiny lung-scarring fibers 
that have been linked to lung cancer and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most asbestos disease sufferers were exposed for years, some people 
with limited exposure have also been stricken, prompting experts to say no 
level is safe to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio workers include employees of Universal and a production company 
involved in the "seaQuest" show. They say their asbestos worries grew soon 
after the Northridge quake, as Universal moved to inspect and shore up wooden 
timbers supporting the large, boxlike sound stage buildings where movies and 
television programs are filmed. 
</P>
<P>
 To expose the timbers, Universal brought in construction workers to smash the 
stucco walls. Film crew members said the operation, which lasted weeks and 
involved several sound stages, created enormous amounts of dust and debris that 
was herded into open dumpsters with brooms and shovels and skip-loaders.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would walk to work in a cloud of dust every morning, because they were out 
there scooping it off the streets," said one member of the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Dust previously had been an occasional nuisance in the sound stage buildings, 
but crew members said it became extreme as they attempted to work while 
construction workers bashed at the outer walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers were hacking and coughing and found it hard to breathe. Several 
said the dust was so thick they saw it dancing in the lights that illuminate 
the sets. 
</P>
<P>
 But workers said that when they voiced concern to Universal's safety office, 
as several said they did, they were told the dust was non-toxic. 
</P>
<P>
 However, last week a crew member scooped a sample of the insulation from one 
of the demolished walls and took it to a private asbestos laboratory. The lab 
report, provided to The Times, says the sample contained a moderate level of 
about 9% asbestos, but in a pulverized, or hazardous, condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed and angry, some crew members called the air district and Cal/OSHA, and 
even 911. "We all kind of feel like we've been lied to," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson and Jim Watters, executive vice president of studio operations for 
Universal City Studios, said the company has done its best to contain asbestos 
under the "emergency circumstances" of shoring up quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not purport to have all the answers" about events of the last few 
weeks, Watters said. "I can't tell you we haven't made mistakes because I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Some film crew members recalled that MCA last fall issued notices on the 
location of asbestos materials -- indicating it was present in some of the 
sound stage walls. 
</P>
<P>
 These advisories -- required by a state asbestos notification law -- 
admonished workers not to disturb the asbestos material, according to copies 
provided to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asbestos is a known human carcinogen," the notices said. "As moving, 
drilling, boring, sanding or otherwise disturbing the identified 
asbestos-containing construction materials may cause exposure to airborne 
asbestos fibers and may present a health risk, no activities that may disturb 
asbestos shall be attempted by anyone who is not qualified and equipped to 
handle asbestos." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one angry crew member: "The only thing they have been doing is sanding, 
boring, ripping, tearing and knocking this stuff down on 60 people that have 
been inside sound stages for 15, 16, 17 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why were these people ripping these stages apart . . . when they had an 
asbestos policy, (and) they knew there was asbestos in the walls?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said Wednesday the notices said asbestos was in fireproofing in the 
sound stage walls. When officials did not see fireproofing, but only ordinary 
blown-in insulation, they assumed it did not contain asbestos, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew members on "seaQuest" said that on the night of March 2 -- hours after 
their telephone complaints to health and safety agencies -- studio safety 
officials ordered them to evacuate a sound stage they were using and leave 
their equipment behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, they said, that sound stage and neighboring areas were cordoned 
off while moon-suited asbestos workers cleaned them up. The film crew was told 
to use another sound stage, but members refused until provided written 
assurances the area was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday and again on Monday, MCA officials provided workers with test data 
showing very low levels of airborne asbestos in three of the sound stages. 
However, crew members said the tests were of little value, since they were 
taken without the heavy banging and foot traffic that stirred the dust to begin 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they told us it was safe, it was not safe," one said. "We're not 
trusting these people anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The air district and Cal/OSHA administer separate rules governing repairs and 
demolition of asbestos-containing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both agencies require asbestos removal by registered asbestos 
contractors, rather than ordinary construction workers. The agencies also 
require that asbestos be gently wetted and stripped to avoid generating dust, 
and that asbestos material be promptly bagged, labeled and disposed only at a 
landfill licensed to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 Both agencies also require advance notice of asbestos removal, so they can 
inspect the job if they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cal/OSHA and the air district were notified last week of the impending 
removal of asbestos roofing material above three of the sound stages. Agency 
officials said they received no other notifications of asbestos work at 
Universal since the earthquake.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; RENOVATED ALEX THEATER GETS RAVE REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first two months of operation following a $6-million renovation effort, 
business at the Alex Theater has exceeded expectations of city officials and 
its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 69-year-old former vaudeville house was sold out for the first performance 
of "Sayonara" in January, a major musical that Alex Regional Theater Board 
members didn't expect to see at the theater so soon, said Larry Clarke, board 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started on this project three years ago, we thought the first year 
would be spent gearing up with community events. Now we're looking at easily 
150 event nights featuring major performances this year," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member board, a nonprofit corporation that leases the theater from 
the city's Redevelopment Agency, has a five-year contract with the Theater 
Corporation of America to manage and operate the 1,463-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater Corporation of America Executive Director Lars Hansen said the Alex 
has "performed better than most theaters" in its first several months of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporation officials have moved ahead of a goal set by the board and the city 
to book the theater for 100 nights in 1994. The theater has already been booked 
for 150 nights for the year, which consists of two seasons, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six musicals will be performed at the complex this year, each running for 17 
performances over a three-week period, with shows featuring comedians, 
magicians and orchestras scheduled in between musical dates. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicals include "Sayonara," which has already closed, "Mame," which 
begins April 7, "Fame," "Sophisticated Ladies," "La Cage Aux Folles" and 
"Perfect Harmony." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency purchased the theater in 1991, using proceeds from a 
bond sale. The city's goal was to renovate the Alex and use it as an anchor to 
strengthen a sluggish retail environment along Brand Boulevard, said Sean 
Clark, Alex Theater project administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said some Brand Boulevard merchants have experienced a 25% jump in 
business since the New Year's Eve opening of the Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 Far Niente Ristorante General Manager Michael Morgan said his Italian-style 
cafe has extended its evening hours to accommodate theatergoers who crave a 
late-night pizza or cappuccino after a performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theater has absolutely, without a doubt, increased our sales," Morgan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment Agency Chairwoman Eileen Givens said the Alex has drawn patrons 
from outside Glendale to the area, and is boosting a sense of community among 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has just been a buzz of excitement around the theater. A bit of history 
has been restored, and there's a sense of pride and community that goes along 
with that," Givens said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CENTER TO DEAL WITH POST-QUAKE FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley's only free trauma center for victims of sexual 
assault is opening its doors and telephone lines to victims of another kind of 
trauma: the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 With a grant from the Los Angeles Women's Foundation, the nonprofit Valley 
Trauma Center is offering assistance to people feeling rattled and fearful in 
the aftermath of the devastating quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which is staffed by graduate students and volunteers affiliated 
with Cal State Northridge, will reach out to victims at Valley schools, 
churches and community organizations. With the $10,000 grant, the center will 
conduct disaster counseling for groups and individuals. The center's 24-hour 
hot line will also be open to victims of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles E. Hanson, a professor of counseling at CSUN, said the trauma center 
is well-equipped to handle the kinds of trauma an earthquake can inflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are specialists in treating trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder," 
Hanson said of the center's counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 A disaster of this magnitude can lead to a variety of emotional reactions, he 
said. The suddenness and intensity of the quake and the unpredictability of the 
aftershocks can shatter one's sense of control. The loss of homes or property 
can cause a feeling of diminished security. And the fear inflicted by the 
experience can trigger a reawakening of painful times in one's past. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Dengler, assistant director of the trauma center, said many people are 
just beginning to face their emotions, nearly two months after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the time when many people are getting upset," Dengler said. "During 
the quake and in the aftermath, people were so busy taking care of things and 
holding themselves together that they didn't necessarily even know what they 
felt. Now they're starting to feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-hour hot line number is (818) 886-0453. SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SCHOOLS TO IMPROVE CAMPUS SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes school board has decided to spend $14,500 to improve security 
at campuses throughout the district, and will allocate at least $50,000 more 
for safety measures after each school develops its own proposals for additional 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote Tuesday night, the board voted to spend $12,000 to buy 20 
walkie-talkies and upgrade its radio system, and $2,500 to provide 
conflict-resolution training to its lunchtime monitors.  
</P>
<P>
 Trustees also decided to have the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
conduct assemblies to teach students how to avoid potentially harmful 
situations and relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater -- though as yet undetermined -- expenditures will be in store for the 
district when school principals return proposals for beefed-up security at 
individual schools. Assistant Supt. Donald Zimring estimated that at least 
$50,000 will be spent on security measures in the 1994-95 school year, adding 
that final approval rests with the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrator sought to allay concerns some district parents have had on 
campus security in the wake of two incidents in Ventura County. In one, a 
student was stabbed to death at Valley View Junior High School in Simi Valley. 
In the other, three students were wounded by gunfire at the scene of a fight in 
a parking lot near Westlake High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of hysteria has risen beyond what was intended and what is 
necessary," said Zimring, who is in charge of business affairs for the 
district. "We need to ask, 'What is a reasonable response?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The administrator and board members stressed that discussions on security in 
the district predated the recent campus violence by 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The board put off hiring campus security guards and installing fences around 
schools until principals decide which safety measures would be most suitable to 
their campuses. "I wholly support you looking to the schools, because it is so 
individual," board member Harry Knaster said to Zimring. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY'S CRIME RATE EXCEEDS GLENDALE'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in years, Burbank had a higher crime rate than neighboring 
Glendale, according to figures released this week for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The per capita crime rate in Burbank was 48 crimes per 1,000 residents 
compared with 44 crimes per 1,000 residents in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glendale has a larger population, so the number of total crimes committed 
in Glendale was higher than in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, 8,215 crimes were committed in Glendale last year, compared with 
4,706 in Burbank. In 1992, 8,282 crimes were committed in Glendale, and 4,648 
crimes were committed in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime rate statistics are compiled from the FBI Crime Index, which counts 
seven different crimes: murder; rape; robbery; aggravated assault; burglary; 
theft; and auto theft. The index does not give more weight to more serious or 
violent crimes, so a shoplifting has the same impact on the statistics as a 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, serious, violent crimes declined in 1993 while theft was the only 
category that increased, said Burbank Police Capt. Gordon Bowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Murders dropped from seven in 1992 to five in 1993. Rapes dropped from 22 in 
1992 to 16 in 1993. Robberies declined from 226 to 209. Aggravated assaults 
dropped from 312 to 263. Burglaries dropped from 764 to 665, and auto thefts 
were down from 764 in 1992 to 665 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the number of thefts in Burbank increased, from 2,261 in 1992 to 2,556 
last year, Bowers said. That may be because of an increase in retail stores in 
Burbank, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of crimes in 1993 increased by 58 crimes, or 1%, Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank police are looking at special programs such as the downtown summer 
bicycle patrols and other ways of giving special attention in the community to 
fight crime, Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Glendale, Burbank also compared its crime figures with 
Torrance, Pasadena, Inglewood, Los Angeles and Santa Monica. A six-year average 
of crime rates from 1988 to the present showed Burbank with the lowest rate, 
with 45.22 crimes per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The other cities' crime rate average over the six years ranged from 49 per 
1,000 in Glendale to 110 per 1,000 in Santa Monica. The crime rate in Los 
Angeles during the past six years averaged 92 per 1,000 residents. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CANDIDATES FOR COUNCIL DISCUSS THEIR PLATFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The San Fernando Chamber of Commerce held a forum Wednesday introducing the 
City Council candidates for the upcoming April 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the forum, held at the Odyssey Restaurant in Granada Hills, was 
to allow each candidate to outline a platform for San Fernando's business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the eight candidates for the three at-large seats were present: 
incumbents Doude Wysbeek and Jose Hernandez and newcomers Raul Godinez, John 
Becker and Joanne Baltierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Ed Guzman and Arthur Kay did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement on behalf of Mayor Dan Acuna, who is also running for reelection, 
was read on his behalf. Acuna and San Fernando Police Chief Dominick Rivetti 
were in Washington on Wednesday to meet with President Clinton for an 
anti-crime briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 Godinez, an engineer who works for the Los Angeles Department of Public Works, 
told audience members that one of San Fernando's most significant problems is 
its negative image. He proposed hiring a public relations firm to help change 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake has provided us with a challenge and an opportunity to rebuild 
San Fernando," he said. "We need to change the city's image." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltierrez, a lifelong San Fernando resident, said that retaining 
earthquake-damaged businesses, creating more youth programs and improving the 
area's literacy rate are the city's important issues. She proposed waiving 
business fees for one year to keep damaged businesses in the city and possibly 
lure merchants from other areas to San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, a member of the San Fernando Transportation and Safety Commission, 
said the city's residents are uninformed about the goings-on of the City 
Council. He said that if elected he would make more of an effort to involve 
residents in city politics and keep them in touch with government. 
</P>
<P>
 Wysbeek, who emigrated from Holland to San Fernando in 1958 and has been 
active in the city's politics for years, said safety within city boundaries and 
a laissez-faire climate for business are his main concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, leave the businessman alone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, a professor of urban studies at Cal State Northridge, said his goal 
if elected would be to "maintain the high level of services the city is 
providing without raising taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber also sponsored a forum Wednesday night in the San Fernando City 
Council chambers for candidates to make statements and answer questions from 
chamber members and the public. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; MOST INCUMBENTS KEEP SEATS ON PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most incumbents retained their seats in the election of a citizens advisory 
panel for a controversial, multimillion-dollar city redevelopment project area 
in North Hollywood, according to unofficial election results released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither pro- nor anti-redevelopment agency forces in the Project Area 
Committee claimed victory after Tuesday night's election at St. David's 
Episcopal Church. The 25-member panel must determine winners in April of two 
tie-breakers for seats on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, which has no legislative power, is the only residential panel 
that advises the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, or CRA, on budgets and 
projects in the 740-acre North Hollywood Redevelopment Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The project area, created in November, 1979, to spur investment and reduce 
blight, is bounded by Cahuenga Boulevard on the east, Tujunga Avenue on the 
west, Camarillo Street on the south and Hatteras Street on the north. Only 
voting-age residents living in the redevelopment area were allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 15 slots on the panel up for election, nine were occupied by incumbents 
and the other six were vacant, said CRA community relations specialist Walter 
Beaumont. The open slots, for one- and two-year terms, were in five categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Lee Cameron was ousted by newcomer Jack T. Elliot for a two-year 
position in the absentee owners category. Ruth M. Loza retained her position in 
that category. 
</P>
<P>
 Two incumbents were tied with challengers, according to the results released 
by city officials. Incumbent James Mahfet tied newcomer Joan Gonzales in the 
community organizations category and David A. Cox tied incumbent Marian 
Suprenant in the business owners/tenants category. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents reelected were Diana V. Hoffman, representing community 
organizations; Bonnie Fine, residential tenants; Ruth M. Loza, absentee owners; 
Lenora Rosen, residential owners/occupants, and Eugene B. Loza and Glenn B. 
Hoiby, business owners/tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 New committee members elected include Stephen Riley and Virginia Soltes, 
residential owners/occupants; Harriet Newton, community organizations, and 
Michael L. Reynolds and Charlotte Harkin Abaer, residential tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has pledged to spend nearly $61 million on projects such as new 
housing units, a shopping center and the Academy Entertainment and Business 
Center, home of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-redevelopment agency forces on the panel have accused the CRA of catering 
to developers and wasting taxpayer money on white elephants, such as the 
partially vacant Academy Entertainment and Business Center. Committee members 
who support the CRA say the agency has provided housing and new jobs. JEFF

<P>
 The San Fernando City Council has approved 1994-95 Community Development Block 
Grant funding for 12 local projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 20th year in San Fernando, block grant funding is designed to serve the 
low- and moderate-income population by funding public service projects and 
housing rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall 1994-95 budget for San Fernando is $534,545. 
</P>

 This year's largest recipient, with $150,000, is the city's housing 
rehabilitation program, which provides low-interest and deferred loans and 
grants to low- and medium-income households for home rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other 11 recipients are a city program to "improve the aesthetics of 
the community" by removing graffiti from public property, $30,000; a program by 
El Centro de Amistad and the San Fernando Police Department to provide 
entertainment for teen-agers to deter them from getting involved with gangs, 
$30,000; a parent/youth interaction program designed to provide homework 
assistance to students and computer literacy skills to children and their 
parents, $5,000; a city after-school child-care program that provides services 
for low- and moderate-income parents, $19,800; a program by the North Valley 
Counseling Center to help youths who have not been in juvenile hall but have 
experienced problems with the law, $16,145, and a program by the North Valley 
Family Counseling Center to help youths returning from juvenile hall enter 
their school and home environments, $22,146. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando is one of 50 cities participating in the County Community 
Development Block Grant Program, administered by the Los Angeles County 
Community Development Commission. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

JUDGE ALLOWS PHOTO OF WIDOW IN SLAYING TRIAL; COURT: PICTURE SHOWS MARY ELLEN 
SAMUELS, ACCUSED OF KILLING HER HUSBAND AND A HIT MAN, COVERED WITH $20,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 There she was, the recently widowed Mary Ellen Samuels, lying on her back in a 
hotel bed in Cancun, wearing only a smile and about $20,000 -- cold cash. 
</P>
<P>
 If a picture is worth a thousand words, then the Polaroid snapshot now 
officially known as People's Exhibit 2 promises to be a star prosecution 
witness for Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi, who is alleging that Samuels killed 
her husband -- and then the hit man she hired to do the job -- for financial 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Groover, the man who took the picture in 1989, identified it in court 
Wednesday. Asked what it depicts, he responded: "U.S. currency. Mary Ellen. A 
hotel bed, I believe in Cancun." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, who turned 45 on Wednesday, goes on trial later this month in Van 
Nuys Superior Court on charges of murder, soliciting murder, attempted murder 
and conspiracy.  
</P>
<P>
 The former manager of a Sherman Oaks sandwich shop is accused of hiring James 
Bernstein, a 27-year-old cocaine dealer, in late 1988 to kill her estranged 
husband, a motion-picture cameraman who was working on the film "Lethal Weapon 
2." The prosecution alleges that Robert Samuels, 40, was slain so his estranged 
wife could collect about $500,000 in insurance. Then, Mary Ellen Samuels 
allegedly hired another hit man to kill Bernstein in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi is alleging that the photograph captures Samuels' "state of mind" as 
she savored the fruits of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Philip Nameth argued that the photograph proved nothing and 
would only prejudice the jury against his client. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Judge Michael Hoff sided with the prosecution and ruled that the 
snapshot is "highly probative" and can be shown to the jury. The judge ruled, 
however, that the jury won't hear testimony about the personal license plate on 
Mary Ellen Samuels' black Toyota convertible: "NAST VXN." 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason they want to use it is, it portrays Ms. Samuels as a nasty person 
and a nasty vixen," Nameth protested, arguing that what a person puts on a 
license plate has little to do with murder. Hoff agreed with the defense after 
consulting his dictionary. "Nasty," he noted, means "very dirty or filthy, 
offensive, morally offensive, indecent, mean, malicious, ill-humored," while 
"vixen" is defined as "a female fox" or an "ill-tempered, shrewish woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge deferred ruling on whether Samuels' daughter, Nicole Samuels 
Moroianu, who Maurizi described as "an unindicted co-conspirator," can testify 
for the defense while avoiding cross-examination by invoking her Fifth 
Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense expects Moroianu, 23, to testify that Robert Samuels molested her 
as a child and raped her when she was 12, Nameth said. The defense attorney has 
said that Bernstein acted on his own when he killed Robert Samuels after Nicole 
told him about the alleged abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Conroy shook her head angrily at the allegation that her slain brother 
had molested his adopted daughter. "It's the ultimate betrayal. He isn't here 
to defend himself. Bob was a hard-working guy and he loved them very much. He 
never would have done anything to them." Called to the stand Wednesday, 
Moroianu answered two questions, then asserted her right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 As she stepped down from the stand, the prosecution slapped Moroianu with a 
subpoena ordering her to appear March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff's rulings came after a day of testimony that provided a sneak preview of 
what promises to be an offbeat and dramatic trial. 
</P>
<P>
 There even was a brief appearance by one of the men who admitted killing 
Bernstein at Mary Ellen Samuels' behest. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Edwin Thomas Gaul, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in April, 
1991, testified under a plea bargain that spared his life and exposes him to a 
minimum 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his testimony that he killed Bernstein for Mary Ellen Samuels "in 
the hills of Ventura County," Gaul recalled that he used her black Toyota with 
the "vixen" tags.

TAFT HIGH SCHOLARS TO DEFEND STATE TITLE; COMPETITION: THE ACADEMIC DECATHLON 
FINALS WILL MATCH STUDENTS FROM 43 COUNTIES IN 10 CATEGORIES. THE SCHOOL HAS 
WON THREE TIMES BEFORE. 
</P>

 The nine members of Taft High School's Academic Decathlon team headed to 
Stockton on Wednesday for the state finals, excited but still worried that they 
could be the only team from their school to lose a state competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills school has won the California title each of the three times 
it has represented the Los Angeles Unified School District at the state 
decathlon, including at last year's competition. In 1989, Taft went on to win 
the U. S. Academic Decathlon. Last year, the team finished second nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going up there to give it our best shot," Taft coach Arthur Berchin 
said. "But a lot of the other schools would like to stop us, and I can't blame 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taft team has good reason to be confident. At the districtwide 
competition, Taft took the district title with a record-high 50,515 points out 
of a possible 60,000. In addition, Taft senior Daniel Berdichevsky became the 
highest individual scorer in the history of the local competition, with 9,300 
points out of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend's winning team will represent California at the U. S. Academic 
Decathlon in Newark, N. J., in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're competing to prove that what happened at city (decathlon) wasn't a 
fluke," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Friday, the students will compete against teams from 43 California 
counties in 10 events: math, fine arts, economics, science, literature, social 
studies, speech, essay, interview and the Super Quiz -- an oral competition 
with 10 questions each worth 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of this year's Super Quiz is "The Documents of Freedom," which will 
test students' knowledge of readings from the Declaration of Independence, the 
Magna Carta, the Camp David accord and others. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, lounging around Burbank Airport and joking with each other to 
alleviate the tension, the students could have been a group of teen-agers 
heading off for spring break. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Rissman sat down on the airport gate's floor and slipped headphones 
over her ears. Sage Vaughn pointed to teammate Michael Michrowski and told him 
he looked "like Pee-wee Herman on crack." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Salter, who earned the second-highest score at the local competition, 
playfully urged his team members to turn the decathlon's traditional 
gift-giving ceremony -- the "nerd commodity exchange," he called it -- into a 
"mosh pit," or slam-dance. 
</P>
<P>
 But seconds later, when Rebecca handed him the cassette recorder, Andrew 
hummed a Beethoven tune aloud until he could name the piece. It was an 
impromptu practice, he explained, for the fine arts competition. 
</P>
<P>
 And all were able to recite the team's motto: "If we do our best, we'll win. 
If we don't win, we didn't do our best." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew confided that if the team is not victorious this weekend, they have a 
backup plan to hide out in Alaska until the fanfare dies down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or we could say that the earthquake was a setback," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah!" Daniel piped in. "We persevered in spite of a terrible disaster!" 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Daniel, Michael, Rebecca, Andrew and Sage, who are all 17, 
competing for Taft are Chris Huie, 17; Sheldon Peregrino, 18; Kimberly Shapiro, 
16, and Stephen Shaw, 16. All are seniors except Shaw, a junior.

MANSLAUGHTER VERDICT SOUGHT IN SLAYING; COURTS: JUDGE REDUCES MURDER CHARGES 
AGAINST IRANIAN IMMIGRANT IN WIFE'S DEATH. ATTORNEY SAYS MAN'S CULTURAL 
BACKGROUND WAS A FACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Outlining his unique "cultural defense" strategy, an attorney defending an 
Iranian immigrant who admittedly bludgeoned his wife to death told a jury 
Wednesday that his client will not shirk his responsibility, but that he should 
be convicted only of voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz dismissed 
first-degree murder charges against Moosa Hanoukai in the death of his wife, 
Manijeh, on the night of March 20, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai, 55, erupted and killed his wife after a particularly virulent fight 
that was laced with many curses and threats, attorney James E. Blatt said in 
his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "An explosion occurred out of frustration, of rage," Blatt said. "Mr. Hanoukai 
took a wrench from the kitchen and went upstairs and killed his wife," he said, 
providing the first details on how the woman was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 No murder weapon was found, but a medical examiner testified earlier this week 
that Manijeh Hanoukai died from blunt force trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatt made his opening statement after Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen M. Cady 
rested her case, in which she characterized the slaying as a calculated murder 
that arose from a domestic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 As Blatt spoke, Hanoukai wept, and a male juror in the six-man, six-woman 
panel appeared to wipe away tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Manijeh Hanoukai, 45, was found in the garage of the couple's 
Woodland Hills home five days after she was killed. Blatt said that after the 
slaying, Hanoukai realized what he had done, cleaned up the blood and left the 
body in the garage after wrapping it in plastic and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai spent 25 years in a miserable marriage that was arranged by a 
matchmaker. For years he was forced to sleep on the floor by his domineering 
wife, Blatt said. Eventually, Blatt added, Hanoukai could take no more, 
frustrated by his wife, isolated by his inability to speak English and dejected 
by his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney promised jurors they would hear evidence about "a culture 
that is vastly different from yours and mine," one that is male-dominated and 
religious. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will be presented evidence about the stigma of a divorce," Blatt said, 
explaining that Hanoukai was prevented from leaving his marriage by his Iranian 
and Jewish backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 One defense witness, another Iranian immigrant whose family owned a shop in 
Huntington Park next to the Hanoukai clothing store, said Manijeh Hanoukai 
constantly harassed her husband, calling him "stupid" and an "idiot" in public. 
Hanoukai would never respond to his wife and would only look at the ground 
during the woman's diatribes, testified Yousef Baghshyandeh. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense won a victory when Stoltz threw out the first-degree murder 
charges. The ruling means the judge found no evidence the killing was 
premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai now faces one count of second-degree murder, which carries a sentence 
of 15 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of voluntary manslaughter -- a killing during the heat of passion 
and the charge recommended by Blatt -- Hanoukai would face 11 years in prison 
and could be paroled in less than half of that time.

OFFICER SHOOTS MAN DURING CAR THEFT AT HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A school police officer Wednesday shot and wounded a man who tried to drive 
over the officer while helping an accomplice steal a car from a parking lot at 
El Camino Real High School, school authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is extremely rare" for school police officers to shoot anyone, said Shel 
Erlich, a school district spokesman, but Erlich had no record of how many such 
shootings there have been. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 10:40 a.m. when Los Angeles Unified School 
District Police Officer Aaron Mengazzi, responding to a report of a possible 
car theft, spotted two men in the school parking lot, Erlich said. One of the 
men was behind the wheel of a burgundy Oldsmobile and the other was inside a 
student's car, Erlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the man in the Oldsmobile saw Mengazzi, he drove straight toward him, 
accelerating as he approached, Erlich said. Mengazzi dodged the vehicle and 
fired one shot, which struck the driver in the thigh, Erlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mengazzi arrested Leon Blunt, 36, of Los Angeles when he crashed into a 
barrier as he tried to escape, Erlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other man, who had succeeded in starting the student's car, roared out of 
the parking lot in the vehicle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mengazzi radioed Los Angeles police in the vicinity to watch for the stolen 
car. It was sighted less than half an hour later by a patrol unit on Winnetka 
Avenue just north of the Ventura Freeway overpass, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver ran, but officers chased him across the Ventura Freeway and 
arrested Derrick Johnson, 28, of Pacoima, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt was treated at West Hills Regional Medical Center for a gunshot wound to 
his right thigh. He was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on 
a police officer. His bail will be set at $50,000, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was booked on suspicion of grand theft auto and held on $20,000 bail, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 School district police will investigate the shooting at the campus and 
detectives with the Los Angeles Police Department will handle the car theft, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last shooting on a district campus by a school police officer occurred 
Jan. 17, about three hours before the Northridge earthquake, when an officer 
shot a suspected burglar at Mt. Vernon Middle School near Downtown Los Angeles, 
Erlich said.

POLICE ARREST 2 MEN AFTER HIGH-SPEED CHASE IN RESEDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men wanted on parole violations led police on a high-speed chase Wednesday 
that wound around the same block three times before the men collided with 
another car and crashed into a fire hydrant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began about 7:45 a.m. when Los Angeles Police Officer Ken Knox saw a 
man he recognized as a wanted felon outside an apartment building in the 17700 
block of Sherman Way, Police Sgt. Roger Ferguson said. The man, later 
identified as Thomas James West of Sylmar, fled, Ferguson said. Knox and his 
partner then gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
 They spotted West behind the wheel of a pickup truck -- later identified as 
stolen -- with a passenger at Sherman Way and Jamieson Avenue, Ferguson said. 
West ran a stop sign, ignored the police car's siren and red lights, and led 
police on a 70 m.p.h chase around circles formed by Sherman Way, Zelzah, 
Lindley and Hesperia avenues and Saticoy Street, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 West collided with a car carrying a mother and her child as he ran a signal at 
Hesperia Avenue and Saticoy Street, Ferguson said. The pickup truck struck a 
fire hydrant on the northwest corner and flipped over. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested West and John Vanbooven, who also was wanted on parole 
violations, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the crash victims were treated at Northridge Hospital Medical Center for 
minor injuries, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described West and Vanbooven as career criminals and expressed interest 
in seeing how they will fare under the three-day old "three strikes and you're 
out" law. "This guy doesn't have two or three strikes against him, he's got 20 
or 30," Ferguson said, referring to West's criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 West was booked on suspicion of felony evading, hit-and-run and drunken 
driving because police believe that he was under the influence of a controlled 
substance at the time of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanbooven was arrested on a parole violation. Both were held without bail at 
Van Nuys Jail, Ferguson said.

RALPHS CANCELS PLAN TO BUILD STORE IN ACTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move, Ralphs Grocery Co. has canceled its controversial plans to 
build a 40,000-square-foot store in Acton, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs officials said they would not comment until next week on the reason for 
their decision.The announcement came the day before a hearing was scheduled on 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Needless to say, it's highly unusual to get this close to a decision and 
withdraw, especially after they've had one hearing," said Dave Vannatta, 
planning deputy for County Supervisor Michael Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The store faced opposition from many Acton residents fearful of 
overdevelopment in their rural community. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked Ralphs to scale back proposed operating hours from always open to a 
6 a.m. to midnight schedule, to limit signs advertising alcohol sales and 
provide security. 
</P>
<P>
 After first balking, Ralphs agreed to the requests. A public hearing had been 
scheduled for Thursday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HALF-BROTHER TO STAND TRIAL IN SLAYING; 
VIOLENCE: ERIC LAMONT GUNN ALLEGEDLY FIRED INTO A CROWD AT A PAY-TO-ENTER PARTY 
IN LANCASTER, KILLING RAYSHAUN LOVE. TWO MEN WHO WERE WOUNDED TESTIFY. 
</P>

<P>
 Rayshaun Love would have celebrated his 18th birthday Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Love's half-brother, Eric Lamont Gunn, was ordered Wednesday to stand 
trial in Love's slaying at a pay-to-enter party in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Love was killed early Dec. 19 when the party he and another 100 or so people 
attended turned violent. Gunn, 23, was arrested and charged with murder less 
than two days later. He also is charged with two counts of attempted murder and 
one count of rock cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Municipal Judge Ian R. Grant ordered Gunn to answer the charges after 
a preliminary hearing that included testimony from two other men who were 
wounded at the party. A Superior Court arraignment was scheduled for March 29. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Gunn took out a small handgun after fellow 
party-goer Darius Perry accidentally spilled beer on Gunn's shoes. Gunn shot 
Perry, 20, in the shoulder and then fired into the crowd, fatally shooting his 
half-brother and wounding Brian Donnell Macklin, 21, prosecutors have alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the shooting, Perry identified Gunn as the person who had shot him 
and fired into the crowd. He also told a sheriff's detective he could identify 
Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
 But during testimony Wednesday, Perry said, "I ain't sure," when asked if Gunn 
was the one who shot him. Perry testified that he got in a fight with someone 
at the party, but that he could not remember with whom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seen two people with guns (at the party)," said Perry, who testified that 
he is a gang member. "I seen a lot of people with guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven D. Ogden asked Perry: "Is it customary for one gang 
member not to testify against another?" to which Perry replied, "I never heard 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe . . . Mr. Perry was not indeed testifying truthfully today as to 
who shot him," Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Macklin, who was wounded in the left upper arm and right hip, testified that 
Perry told him Gunn was the person who shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and Macklin met while they were hospitalized after the shooting, Macklin 
said. "He (Perry) told me he was hit by Gunn; he was the one that was firing." 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, Martha Jordan, the mother of Love and Gunn, wept openly at 
times. She declined to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But Manuel R. Martinez, Jr., a public defender representing Gunn, later said 
that there is no strong evidence against his client. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Love's killing, a law was passed by the Lancaster City Council 
that outlaws pay-to-enter parties in residential neighborhoods. The ordinance 
took effect Monday. A maximum fine of $500 and/or six months in jail can be 
imposed on anyone holding such parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Love's killing is not the first to occur at a pay-to-enter party in the 
Antelope Valley. Since 1990, two other deaths and numerous injuries have 
occurred at the get-togethers.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LANCASTER OKS $7.3-MILLION DEAL TO ASSIST 
PRICE/COSTCO PROJECT; ECONOMY: THE CITY WILL BUY THE EXISTING STORE AND PROVIDE 
LAND FOR A NEW ONE TO STOP A MOVE TO PALMDALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite criticism from residents who said the city should not subsidize retail 
stores, the Lancaster City Council has unanimously approved a $7.3-million deal 
to aid construction of a new Price/Costco store. 
</P>
<P>
 At their meeting Monday, council members said they feared that without the 
financial help, the warehouse chain might build another store in Palmdale and 
drain off sales tax dollars that are needed to support city services in 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Costco, a membership warehouse store, has been the city's leading producer of 
sales tax dollars for several years. The chain recently merged with Price Club 
and now operates as Price/Costco. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a terrific enterprise, and we want to keep them here," said 
Councilman George Root. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the complex agreement, the city's redevelopment agency will pay 
Price/Costco $7.3 million for its current store in Lancaster's Valley Central 
Shopping Center and the 11.5-acre parcel it sits on, said Steven H. Dukett, the 
city's redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will pay part of this by giving Price/Costco 15 acres of vacant 
land that the agency owns nearby at Lancaster Boulevard and 25th Street West. 
Price/Costco will build a new 156,000-square-foot store, larger than its 
present one, on the vacant land. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency will reduce its obligation to Price/Costco by 
building public improvements, such as streets and sewer lines, and by paying 
city fees -- all of which are Price/Costco's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will have 15 years to pay the remaining $3.5 million obligation, 
plus interest. Dukett said the agency will try to pay off the debt sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's City Council meeting, Michael Singer, a candidate for the council 
in next month's election, objected to using tax dollars to help a large retail 
store that may drive smaller local shops out of business. "People don't want 
the city involved in retail subsidies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Harris, owner of a small pet shop, said his business is being hurt by a 
large new PetsMart store, which also received financial aid from the city. "My 
business has been destroyed by you gentlemen," he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said they must offer incentives to attract large retail 
stores that will generate the sales tax dollars that pay for law enforcement 
and other services. In recent years, Lancaster has lost sales tax money to 
Palmdale, which has developed a regional shopping mall and other busy retail 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who leave this community to buy things," said Councilman 
George Runner. "We have to protect our retail base." 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster officials estimate that over its first 10 years, the new 
Price/Costco store will generate $1.6 million in sales tax money and 
redevelopment funds for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a related plan approved earlier by the council, after Price/Costco moves 
into its new store, the city will renovate the vacated building and lease it to 
Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse. That outlet is also expected to generate new 
jobs and sales tax revenue.

JUDGE ROGAN ENDORSED FOR NOLAN SEAT BY GOP LEADERS; ELECTIONS: A SPECIAL MAY 3 
VOTE WILL BE HELD TO SELECT A SUCCESSOR TO THE POPULAR REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLYMAN, 
WHO RESIGNED AFTER PLEADING GUILTY TO EXTORTION.

 A gathering of about 150 Republican leaders Wednesday night picked Glendale 
Municipal Judge James E. Rogan as the party's candidate to replace Pat Nolan, 
the popular GOP state assemblyman toppled from office by scandal only two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Gov. Pete Wilson picked May 3 as the date for a special election to 
replace Nolan, 43, who resigned after pleading guilty to extorting $10,000 from 
a hotel chain and was sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, a former deputy district attorney, was endorsed earlier by two-thirds 
of the Republican members of the Assembly and easily swept the mini-convention 
Wednesday. 
</P>

 Finding a consensus candidate has been particularly important to Republicans 
in the 43rd Assembly District following reapportionment. After redistricting, 
the number of registered Republicans in the district slipped from 47% to 42%, 
while Democratic registration rose from 41% to 44%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan himself won reelection in 1992 with only 56% of the vote against nominal 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real swing seat now -- it could go either way," said Parke Skelton, 
political consultant to Adam Schiff, a former deputy U. S. attorney who has 
filed as a Democratic candidate for the Nolan seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian warned the delegates at Wednesday's meeting that 
because of Democratic Party inroads in the district, they "no longer have the 
privilege to be divisive." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, 36, of Glendale, made his legal reputation by prosecuting a drunk 
driver who had killed four people and for his handling of the Lamb Funeral Home 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting up a fight to block the Rogan endorsement was another GOP hopeful, 
Peter Repovich, a Los Angeles police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Repovich operatives, fearful that a Rogan endorsement was in the offing, had 
earlier faxed a warning to the convention "delegates" that Rogan joined the GOP 
only in 1988 and previously had been an activist in the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a Johnny-come-lately to the Republican Party," Repovich campaign manager 
Berndt Schine complained. 
</P>
<P>
 A biographical sketch of Rogan, published in a judicial handbook, says he has 
belonged to the central committees of both the state and Los Angeles County 
Democratic Party organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Rogan announced his conversion to the Republican Party in 1988 with 
then-U. S. Sen. Pete Wilson at his side and was appointed a judge in 1990 by 
GOP Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, Rogan angrily condemned Repovich's effort to paint him as 
uncommitted to Republicanism and produced a letter from former President Ronald 
Reagan -- himself a former Democrat -- praising Rogan for changing parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan also effectively cited his endorsement by the GOP Assembly members as a 
sign of his Republican bona fides. Sponsoring Rogan's endorsement by the GOP 
lawmakers in Sacramento were Assemblymen Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) and Richard L. 
Mountjoy (R-Arcadia). 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the endorsement, the GOP nomination will still be contested. 
</P>
<P>
 Repovich, for one, vowed to continue his candidacy. The 36-year-old officer 
has already been endorsed by the Police Protective League, the union 
representing Los Angeles police officers, and said he has raised $350,000 for 
his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Also vying for the GOP nomination are Julia Wu, a Silverlake-based member of 
the Board of Trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District, and Peter 
Musurlian, an aide to Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
 GOP strategists are hoping that Nolan's resignation will diminish the voter 
appeal of Schiff, the Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Skelton, Schiff's political consultant, acknowledged that it would have been 
better for Schiff to run against Nolan while the Republican incumbent fought 
corruption charges, as was expected until Nolan suddenly pleaded guilty and 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the second-best scenario is a divisive Republican primary," said Skelton, 
who saw Wednesday's mini-convention as a preliminary to a damaging fight for 
the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 If no candidate gets a simple majority in the May 3 special election, the top 
vote-getters from each party will face each other in a June 28 runoff. The 
winner of the special election will serve out the remainder of Nolan's term, 
which ends Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 To add confusion to the campaign, there will also be a primary election June 7 
and general election Nov. 8 for the same seat. The winner of the Nov. 8 
election will take office when the next regular term begins Dec. 5.

EFFORT TO SELL PANORAMA CITY GM PLANT STUCK IN 1ST GEAR; ECONOMY: FIRM HIRED TO 
MARKET THE 100-ACRE SITE LISTED IT AT $50 MILLION IN APRIL. PLAN TO HAVE THE 
CITY BROKER THE SALE HAS SO FAR FAILED.

 Despite offers by the city of Los Angeles to broker the sale of the vacant 
General Motors plant in Panorama City, efforts to find a buyer for the 100-acre 
plant to help spur economic renewal continue to falter, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 High-level city officials have floated offers to buy the GM plant so the city 
can use its financial backing and tax breaks to make the facility more 
affordable to a new buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan to have the city play middleman in the sale has not been viable 
because neither GM nor the city has been able to attract a serious buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose district includes the plant and who has 
been working to find a new occupant for months, said the city would only 
purchase the plant if a serious buyer is prepared to take it over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always felt that there was an opportunity to use the city or some 
other vehicle as a pass-through to reduce the price," he said. "(But) we really 
need a third-party investor." 
</P>
<P>
 GM spokesman Peter Ternes said the company and city officials have had 
numerous discussions about the plant since it closed in August, 1992, but he 
said the sides are no closer today to signing an agreement than they were 18 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ternes declined to reveal the price that GM has discussed with the city or 
comment on reports that the city has offered between $5 million and $10 million 
for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The selling price depends on how the buyer wants to use the facility. There 
are a lot of factors that will influence the price," Ternes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on Van Nuys Boulevard near Saticoy Street, the plant was once the 
symbol of the region's manufacturing might. The facility's assembly line 
produced 6.3 million cars over 45 years, most notably Camaros and Firebirds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it closed, eliminating 2,600 jobs and further depressing the San 
Fernando Valley's economy, Alarcon and other high-level city officials have met 
with GM officials to discuss incentives that would draw a new manufacturing 
firm to the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But the size of the facility, a potential ground-soil contamination problem 
and the deteriorating condition of the 71,000-square-foot plant have made it 
difficult to market. 
</P>
<P>
 One way the city can attract potential buyers is to offer GM a substantial tax 
break if it sells the site to the city at a below-market price. The city would 
then offer the plant to a third party at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Stein, a special adviser to Mayor Richard Riordan who has been involved in 
trying to speed the plant sale for several weeks, declined to say how close the 
city has come to buying the site, except that the mayor "has been proactive in 
attempting to purchase the property for the purpose of facilitating the 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 But others were more blunt about the plant's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Ternes said, "There hasn't been a lot of earnest interest" in the site since 
it was put up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Cushman-Wakefield, the firm hired by GM to market the property, listed it at 
$50 million in April, 1993. Todd Lorver, a Grubb & Ellis commercial property 
broker, said his company appraised the facility at $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city gets in there and is willing to provide economic assistance to 
users, it can be a viable site, but it's going to take a substantial 
investment," Lorver said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lorver also questioned reports that GM could receive a sizable tax break by 
selling the closed facility to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "GM would have to be manufacturing something there in order to take a tax 
credit. I don't see how this can happen unless there is some special accounting 
done at the state level," Lorver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said a serious offer was made for the plant several months ago by a 
"major corporation" for use as a distribution center. But he said the deal fell 
through, though he declined to provide details, and no other serious offers 
have come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Utah-based trash-disposal firm Wednesday suggested that the GM 
plant be used as a "transfer facility" where earthquake debris can be loaded 
onto trains and hauled away to a massive landfill in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said he will continue to look for a manufacturing firm to occupy the 
plant on a long-term basis.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COUNCIL ADOPTS '9/80' WORK FORMAT FOR CITY 
EMPLOYEES; GOVERNMENT: CITY HALL WILL CLOSE EVERY OTHER FRIDAY AS SHIFTS ARE 
COMPRESSED IN A BID FOR CLEANER AIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning as early as April, City Hall will be closed every other Friday so 
that the city can meet regional standards for cleaner air. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to approve the plan, which compresses a 
two-week, 80-hour work period into nine days.Council member Jan Heidt and Mayor 
George Pederson voted against the controversial plan, known as the "9/80" work 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimed at reducing rush-hour traffic and thereby improving air quality, the 
plan fulfills a requirement of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, half the city's staff had been off every Monday to meet the 
requirement. But in the wake of the Northridge earthquake, the city returned to 
a standard Monday-through-Friday, 40-hour work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan will take effect depending on when workers return to the 
earthquake-damaged City Hall. It could be as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the present system of having reduced staffs on Mondays -- perhaps 
the city's busiest day -- say both productivity and efficiency are affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell, the program hasn't worked very well," Assistant City Manager 
Ken Pulskamp said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the new plan would alleviate some of those concerns, such as half of 
the staff being off the day before Tuesday meetings of the City Council. He 
said all staff members would be available in an emergency situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But one council member said shutting City Hall for a day would damage the 
public's perception of city government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are buying availability with their money, not hours," Heidt 
said. "I can see I'm going to lose this one . . . . but I can't support this." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jill Klajic said that regardless of whether the plan is the most 
efficient use of time, it is worth trying.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TAEKWONDO TEACHER HELD WITHOUT BAIL IN 
COLLEAGUE'S SLAYING; CRIME: THE MAN FACES ALLEGATIONS OF LYING IN WAIT AND 
SEXUAL ASSAULT, WHICH COULD BRING THE DEATH PENALTY.

<P>
 A martial arts instructor charged with murder in the Dec. 15 slaying of a 
fellow teacher was held without bail after turning himself in at the Santa 
Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Edward Milburn, 27, of Pasadena was arraigned in Newhall Municipal 
Court under the watchful eyes of Theresa and Robert Estrada -- siblings of 
Veronica Estrada, a 29-year-old nationally ranked black belt Taekwondo 
instructor whom he is accused of strangling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure he shows up," said Theresa Estrada. "We wanted to make 
sure he doesn't get bail." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities accuse Milburn of committing murder after lying in wait and while 
sexually assaulting the victim. Both are special circumstances that allow 
prosecutors to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a gray blazer, white dress shirt and dark blue-gray slacks, Milburn 
appeared in court about 9:30 a.m., an hour after presenting himself at the 
sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge H. Keith Byram set no bail for Milburn and scheduled a preliminary 
hearing for March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Mounger, Milburn's lawyer, said his client has helped law enforcement 
personnel in their investigation. Mounger said the evidence against Milburn is 
largely circumstantial. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this particular case, Mr. Milburn has been under investigation for more 
than a month and has not fled," said Mounger, who hopes to eventually have a 
bail amount set for his client. "He has cooperated with every step of the 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors acknowledge that Milburn has been cooperative, but say that he may 
have greater incentive to flee now that he faces a possible death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the things counsel has said are basically true," Assistant Dist. Atty. 
Dan Damon said. "(But) there is certainly a flight risk here because of the 
severity of the charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn and Veronica Estrada worked together at Taekwondo USA in Canyon 
Country at the time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 She was last seen walking along Soledad Canyon Road, near Camp Plenty Road, 
about 8:15 p.m. Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Three witnesses said they saw people matching the descriptions of Milburn and 
Estrada along the road at that time. One witness said she saw the woman being 
pulled off the street over an embankment, said Sgt. Doran Riggs of the Santa 
Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are still seeking witnesses who were near Soledad Canyon and 
Camp Plenty roads between 8 and 8:30 p.m. Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may have something we're looking for," said Riggs. "Each of them has 
another part of the story."

OWNER BUSS NEGOTIATING FORUM SALE; FINANCE: MCNALL AND PROSPECTIVE MAJORITY 
PARTNERS WOULD BUILD NEW ARENA ON SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Buss, owner of the Lakers and the Forum, is negotiating with Bruce 
McNall and the Kings' prospective majority partners to sell the arena, the 
property on which it sits and the building's leases with the Kings and Lakers 
for about $200 million, sources close to the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasers -- McNall, Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen -- would build a 
new arena if the deal is completed. But first, the trio and their lawyers must 
close a $60-million transaction that gives Sudikoff and Cohen majority control 
of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Should that happen, there is optimism that the Forum deal can be completed 
within 30 days, although terms of the agreement might change. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's partial information," Sudikoff said of the arena deal, "but it's not 
the whole picture. . . . There are still several economic models. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that there's current and cooperative meetings between 
ourselves and Dr. Buss. It's no secret that a major motivating factor is to 
develop a new building. And the path of least resistance is to involve the 
purchase of the existing Forum." 
</P>
<P>
 One unknown factor is whether Bank of America would own a small interest in 
the new arena. Under one scenario confirmed by a McNall lawyer, the bank would 
receive part ownership in an effort to pay off the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall is selling a majority of the Kings largely so he can pay off the bank, 
which had extended him up to $90 million in loans and credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the final agreement, the one constant is the desired result of these 
talks -- a new state-of-the-art arena, complete with luxury boxes, to be 
erected on the Forum site in Inglewood within three years.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed plan, Buss would receive $100 million up front and another 
$100 million upon completion of the arena. He would continue to own the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss paid $67.5 million in 1979 for the Forum, the Lakers and the Kings. 
McNall bought into the Kings in 1986 and took control from Buss two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still negotiating, we're still working, we're still discussing," McNall 
said. "Sudikoff and Cohen are really spearheading this." 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff and Cohen hope to finalize the $60-million agreement by the end of 
March. Once that happens and they own 65% of the team, Sudikoff and Cohen will 
have the final say in terms of the arena project. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the possible sale of the Forum, Buss replied, "There are so many 
rumors that we feel our best position is no comment." 
</P>
<P>
 If current negotiations are completed within a month, groundbreaking, 
according to the McNall forces, could happen within a year. Construction would 
take 18 to 24 months, which would, if all goes according to the current 
timetable, make the arena available for the 1997-98 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss, however, does not see a new arena arising that quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always thought that was five to seven years off," he said. "It takes 
time to develop the plans and financing and everything. . . . If Bruce brings 
somebody by who gives us a good deal on a new arena, I'm highly likely to do 
that. If he doesn't, then I'll probably build a new arena myself in five or six 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 On one matter, there is no dispute. The Forum, which opened its doors on Dec. 
30, 1967, isn't so fabulous anymore, partially because of its age and partially 
because of its lack of luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange the Forum wasn't built with luxury boxes," Buss said. "I didn't 
always think luxury boxes were the greatest in the world because they were 
always sky boxes. But with the advent of the Palace in Detroit bringing the 
boxes down lower, that has developed a lot of appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 If negotiations between Buss and the Kings' owners are successfully completed, 
the most likely plan would be to build the new arena on the same property, 
perhaps in one corner, leaving the Forum operable while construction proceeds. 
Upon completion of the new building, the Forum would be demolished and the 
parking lot would form a semi-circle around the new arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Another less likely possibility is to build on a new site and leave the Forum 
standing for concerts and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 The key for Sudikoff, Cohen and McNall is to buy the leases of the Kings and 
Lakers, thus guaranteeing they will play in the new arena. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been friction between Buss and the Kings for some time over the 
amount paid by the hockey team under the terms of its lease, which runs until 
July of 2018. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring rent, the cost of changing the playing surface from wood to ice, 
staffing, parking, concessions, advertising and Senate seat revenue, the Kings 
pay about $10 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "One could argue there should be a million-dollar-a-year reduction in the 
lease," Buss said, "and I've certainly told Bruce I'm willing to sit down at 
any time he has the time and negotiate that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me say that the lease arrangement with the Kings was one that was 
established 27 years ago. And only in the last 12 months has there been a 
complaint about it. It's the same lease, you know. I wonder if that isn't a 
smoke screen to just put the blame on something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lease is 12.5% of the gross, which is less than the Lakers pay, as an 
example. But at the time it was signed, the lease was the standard thing around 
the league. Because of the success of the Kings and the high ticket prices, 
that 12.5% has become very valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 According to King sources, Buss has privately agreed to take $2 million a year 
off the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that is not enough, according to Suzan A. Waks, vice chairman of the 
Kings' executive board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been negotiating with Jerry since 1988 to try and share in some of the 
revenue streams created when we brought Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles," Waks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of the lease would, of course, end that dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the friction between the camps has been lessened by the 
arrival of Sudikoff and Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry's not a bad guy," Sudikoff said. "He's been very helpful to me and Joe 
to accomplish the goal. He and Bruce might have too much history. We're fresh 
faces with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody's agendas are pretty much in sync. There's been a good 
spirit of cooperation between myself, Joe and Jerry. I'm encouraged we'll see 
something come together in line with the end of the Kings transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, McNall attempted to bring in an affiliate of the Sony Corporation as 
a financial partner in the arena project. Sony, however, also wanted to buy a 
minority share of both the Kings and the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 That deal never materialized. Was the problem, from Buss' standpoint, the 
requirement of parting with a share of his team? 
</P>
<P>
 "Kind of something like that," he said. "There were other considerations, too, 
but that certainly was one of them. I don't want to sell the Lakers, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Buss says he's sorry he sold the Kings. Six years later, he's attempting to 
get an expansion team for San Diego, where he might be involved in another 
arena project. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two reasons Buss said he sold the Kings to McNall: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buss thought he could get a pro football team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He couldn't get Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong on both counts. Buss' attempts to buy a football team have never come to 
fruition and Gretzky was traded to the Kings soon after McNall took over.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had negotiated to get Gretzky a year earlier than he came here," Buss said. 
"But the negotiations fell apart and I got turned down. So part of my reason 
for the sale was my disappointment at not getting him. . . . I miss the hockey. 
I really do. It's just a great game. I really gave up the hockey with the 
thought of getting football. And then, when football went bye-bye on me, I kind 
of got left without any hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Buss still harbors a desire to also get a football team, ideally the Rams, 
although owner Georgia Frontiere recently said she was not interested in 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have publicly said I would entertain buying the Rams if they ever were for 
sale," Buss said. "And I've said that for over 10 years. There's always been 
rumors they are for sale, but nothing ever happens.  
</P>
<P>
 "When she decides to sell them, I'm sure I'll be aware of it and, at that 
time, we'll negotiate."

 "Cool. Cool," Harding said upon learning that she apparently will be allowed 
to represent the United States in the March 20-27 World Championships in Chiba, 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to win this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was eighth in the recent Winter Olympics, but she might not even have 
been there if her lawyers had not reached a settlement with the U.S. Olympic 
Committee after filing a $25-million lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 Their adversary Wednesday was the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., which had 
scheduled a disciplinary hearing to begin today in Colorado Springs, Colo., to 
determine whether Harding would be suspended because of code of ethics 
violations regarding the Jan. 6 assault on rival Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Portland, Ore., courtroom, U.S. District Judge Owen Panner issued a 
temporary restraining order that prohibits the USFSA from proceeding with the 
hearing for at least 10 days, ruling that Harding had not had enough time to 
prepare her defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The USFSA gave Harding 33 days to appear before the hearing panel after it 
determined last month that there were reasonable grounds to believe she was 
involved in the plot to injure Kerrigan. But her lawyers argued that at least 
20 days were spent in preparing for other legal matters and the Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Panner said that he understands the USFSA's desire to act expeditiously, but 
he added that concern is outweighed by Harding's right to adequately defend 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the association wants her to have a fair hearing, but I do not 
believe they understand the legal complications of this case," Panner said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Harding's "inability to properly prepare and defend her case 
(would) undoubtedly result in her being found guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 After Panner's ruling, lawyers for both sides met with him in chambers for two 
hours but could not agree upon a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The USFSA was attempting to arrange a conference call among its executive 
committee members Wednesday night to decide whether to appeal the ruling to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. If the USFSA does 
not appeal, the earliest it could reschedule the disciplinary hearing would be 
for March 19, the day after the draw for Harding's competition in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because she would not be available for a hearing here when the temporary 
restraining order expires, it would be impossible for us to meet then even if 
the court allowed it," said Bill Hybl, chairman of the USFSA's hearing panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring further legal intervention, he said that the five members of the panel 
probably would not convene for another 30 to 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 USOC officials expressed satisfaction that the judge addressed his objections 
only to the timing of the hearing and did not question the right of sports 
governing bodies to decide eligibility issues as established by the Amateur 
Sports Act of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there is a criminal authority, when someone's liberty is at stake, I 
don't have a problem with a ruling like this," said Anita DeFrantz, a USOC 
executive committee member from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different situation from our normal course of affairs. My immediate 
sense is that we don't have to fix things. The system works."

JIM MURRAY: THIS MARATHONER NO SILLY RABBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To "rabbit" is an intransitive verb which, in track and field, means to 
sacrifice oneself, to take the heat for someone else -- kind of like being on a 
minesweeper or cutting the barbed wire before an offensive. A "rabbit," the 
noun, denotes a self-effacing person who willingly subordinates his ambitions 
for those of another. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess the original rabbit in this country was John Alden when he was the 
forerunner for Miles Standish in pursuit of Priscilla Mullins. She would have 
none of it, you recall, bringing him up short with "Speak for yourself, John." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, a long-distance runner named Paul Pilkington spoke for himself at the 
Los Angeles Marathon on Sunday. He won. He was only supposed to cut the barbed 
wire, so to speak, for the more famed runners such as Luca Barzaghi of Italy, 
or Andrzej Krzyscin of Poland. He was a shock troop meant to blunt the 
opposition, then graciously step aside. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of a rabbit is a widespread if questionable part of track. These are 
kind of the sport's version of stunt men. They are not really part of the race, 
just decoys of a sort. Meet promoters habitually hire them in order to set up 
world records for the mega-stars. They are like the guys who set themselves on 
fire or leap off a cliff into a torrent below or crash cars for the film's 
leading men. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Pilkington was a professional rabbit when he entered the L.A. Marathon. 
His role was twofold: set up the race for the registered stars and set a 
blistering pace that would con the less-experienced into using up all their 
energy -- and oxygen -- trying to keep up. He got paid to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilkington was practically the Easter Bunny of the craft. He had rabbitted at 
the New York City Marathon, as well as those in Cleveland and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the rabbit is supposed to run an unrealistic pace until he has 
pulled the race along behind him and set it up for the serious runners. Then, 
he is meant to step off the track. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what Pilkington had been hired to do. But, along about the step-off 
time, the 16th mile or so, he found himself so alone in the race, he decided to 
keep running, at least until they caught up to him. 
</P>
<P>
 They never did. They were properly indignant when they did show up at the 
finish line to find that Pilkington had been there almost a minute before (in 2 
hours 12 minutes 13 seconds). 
</P>
<P>
 It was rabbitry's finest hour. Bugs Bunny at the finish line chomping on a 
carrot and grinning, "What's up, doc?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pilkington, who was to have been paid only a couple of grand to set his false 
pace, wound up winning $27,000 and a new car. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbitry has long been an integral part of track. But perhaps its finest hour 
came in 1954, when one of most-hallowed records in the whole world of track -- 
the four-minute mile -- came tumbling down. 
</P>
<P>
 The British medical student, Roger Bannister, had studied the four-minute 
barrier the way Jonas Salk studied polio -- with a view to eradicating it. 
</P>
<P>
 The world had thought the sub-four-minute territory impenetrable -- until 
Gunder Hagg ran a 4:01.4 in Sweden right after the war and lopped six seconds 
off the existing record. That, at least, put it in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained tantalizingly out of reach for Bannister, who kept charts on vital 
capacity, oxygen debt, the amount of stress running put on the cardiovascular 
system. He edged closer until the barrier seemed to become psychological 
instead of physical. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then, the future Dr. Bannister found the answer. He chanced upon a 
colleague, another miler named Chris Chataway. Chris was a dedicated runner but 
well realized he would never become the miler Bannister was. Bannister had a 
7-foot 6-inch stride, his heart and lungs were enlarged and augmented by 
repeated workouts. His pulse rate was 45. Suddenly, Chataway was not a 
competitor but an accomplice. He began to serve as rabbit for the 
man-with-a-mission, Bannister. 
</P>
<P>
 The legality of rabbitry has never been properly authenticated. Or even 
addressed. But, when Bannister began posting 4:02 miles, the British track 
authorities balked. They disallowed the time as a British record (even though 
it was). The Brits frowned on a non-competitive race fueled by a rabbit. Not 
what track was all about, they sniffed, adjusting their monocles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bannister ignored them. Then, one rainy afternoon, May 6, 1954, on the 
outskirts of Oxford University, Bannister assembled a small crowd and his 
personal bunny, Chataway, and another hare, Chris Brasher. 
</P>
<P>
 Brasher set the pace for the first two laps, 57.4 and 1:58 for the half. Then, 
he stepped off the track and Chataway took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Chataway slowed 250 yards from the finish and Bannister swept by him. He 
collapsed into the arms of friends at the tape. The time came over the 
loudspeaker: "3 minutes, 59 and 4/10 seconds!" 
</P>
<P>
 He had broken Hagg's record by two seconds. He had run the first 
under-four-minute mile ever recorded or not run by a guy fleeing a lion. The 
British Amateur Athletic Union had no choice but to accept it. They didn't want 
to be thrown into the Tower of London. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of rabbits has been endemic ever since. If the meet wanted a world 
mark, it employed a guy to step out suicidal fractions. It didn't always work. 
L.A.'s track impresario, Al Franken, recalls the time he hired a putative 
rabbit -- and the guy went out on the track and began running second . "How can 
you pace the race from behind?!" Al demanded in some exasperation. "I couldn't 
catch him!" lamented the (ex) rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 The first duty of a rabbit is to catch the leaders. This, Paul Pilkington had 
no trouble with. The second duty is, he must step off the track midway or 
three-quarters through. Pilkington failed miserably at this. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Roger Bannister, his rabbits knew their place. That's why he's 
Sir Roger today. Pilkington blew it. Just goes to show you -- you can't get 
good help anywhere these days.

IT'S BETTER LATE THAN NEVER FOR LYNCH; LAKERS: ROOKIE WAS NONEXISTENT EARLY IN 
THE SEASON, BUT HE IS NOW STARTING AND PUTTING UP IMPRESSIVE NUMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His timing wasn't real good in 1970, which was supposed to be the first grand 
entrance. He was two months premature, weighing only 2 1/2 pounds at birth with 
a lot of breathing problems, before growing strong and healthy to reach 6 foot 
7, 225 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Come last fall and winter, when it was time for another big debut, George 
Lynch again took a detour, this time arriving two months late to his Laker 
career. The problems in November and December were with matchups at forward and 
minutes, only to give way to fate in early January and then, as if out of 
nowhere, talent. 
</P>
<P>
 It started out uneventfully. He spent 11 of the first 33 games on the bench. 
Much of that time was buried on the depth chart behind free agents Trevor 
Wilson, Antonio Harvey and Kurt Rambis, and that was with Elden Campbell on the 
injured list and Doug Christie working his way back from an injury. The 22 
appearances came at an average of 9.2 garbage-time minutes per outing. In one 
game, Nov. 27 at Minnesota, he got three fouls in 13 seconds trying to handle 
Christian Laettner. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times," Lynch said, "I would sit there, me and Antonio talking about 
waiting. I would wish we would either get blown out or we would blow out the 
other team so we could play. Just play 15 minutes. I know that's not good, but 
that was the attitude we had. We didn't want the game to be close." 
</P>
<P>
 In 24 games since moving into the starting lineup, he is averaging 14.5 
points, 8.5 rebounds, 2.8 steals and 37.3 minutes and shooting 52.1%. Only 
Jamal Mashburn, Chris Webber, Isaiah Rider and Anfernee Hardaway are scoring 
better among first-year players. Only Webber is getting more rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch might go from not being one of 17 people picked for the rookie all-star 
game in February to being one of five on the all-rookie team at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised," he said. "I was the 12th pick in the draft. I feel I'm 
only doing what I was supposed to do all along." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers' highest draft choice since another North Carolina product, James 
Worthy, went No. 1 in 1982, Lynch had power forward skills in a small forward 
body when he arrived in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't big enough to regularly battle inside -- he is listed at 6-8, claims 
to be 6-7 1/2, while the Lakers say 6-6 1/2 is closer to the truth -- and 
couldn't supply the offensive clout needed at the quicker position. That he had 
to learn both only made the transition tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Randy Pfund used him at both spots early on, when he used Lynch at all. 
Frustrated that he wasn't getting a chance even as the Lakers continued to 
lose, and calling coaches and players in Chapel Hill to say he never imagined 
things would be like this, everything changed on the afternoon of Jan. 10, when 
Christie suffered a severely sprained ankle in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch thought Worthy would move into the starting lineup the next night, but 
Pfund went with Lynch and the youth movement at small forward against Golden 
State. He lasted 21 minutes before fouling out with 8:44 left, but not before 
getting eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Jan. 14 against Charlotte and 24 points and 10 rebounds. That was 
followed by what he thinks is his best showing -- 14 points, nine rebounds and 
seven steals at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything changed. The Lakers drafted him, a move that surprised many, and 
counted on getting a solid, dependable player for 10 years, and now, suddenly, 
they had someone making major contributions at the first real opportunity. The 
problem of where to play soon belonged to Christie because small forward was 
locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Within another few games, when Lynch should finally reach the qualifying 
minimum, he might be in the top 10 in the league in shooting and the top 15 in 
steals. Those are the best of the numbers -- 52.9% and 1.65, respectively -- 
tempered by the first 33 games, but the rest are, as the Lakers expected, 
dependable: 9.6 points and 5.4 rebounds in 23.8 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "From looking at his background and the fact that we came from the same place, 
with 30 or 35 minutes a game, he'll be giving them 15 (points) and 10 
(rebounds) every night about two years from now," said Rick Fox of the Boston 
Celtics, a former North Carolina teammate. "Easily. That's pretty solid." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pfund: "I just don't think we expected quite this much so soon. If he 
would have just come in every night and held his own and played solid, that 
would have been great. But that's the thing. He has more than just held his 
own. He's making big plays, putting up the numbers rebounding, hustling every 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, for his part, said he is happy to earn his money -- $1.1 million in 
salary -- instead of getting it for sitting. The question now is not can he 
earn it, but where -- small forward or power forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch says he is more comfortable at power forward, his home at North 
Carolina. Pfund ponders the possibilities, figuring Lynch "probably more than 
likely has found a home" at small forward. He also contemplates a step up in 
weight class when Christie and/or Anthony Peeler are healthy again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy I'm playing more, happy that I'm in the starting lineup," he said. 
"I'm just glad things are going well for me." 
</P>
<P>
 One way or another, at one spot or another, things have turned right-side up 
for Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Right on schedule.

BROWNOUT IN STORE FOR RAIDERS?; PRO FOOTBALL: WIDE RECEIVER SAYS HE WANTS TO 
SIGN WITH BRONCOS. HORTON SIGNS WITH REDSKINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Denver, Tim Brown says he wants to be a Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Washington, Ethan Horton becomes a Redskin. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the brightest day in Raider history. Brown and Horton were the 
club's leading receivers last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a restricted free agent, visited with Bronco officials Wednesday and 
then announced that he hoped the Raiders would not exercise their right to 
match an anticipated offer sheet from Denver, one that is expected to be worth 
$11 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned," Brown said in Denver, "this is the place I want to 
be. I don't think there's a better situation for me as a wide receiver. That's 
the most important thing to me. This team is where I want to be and they have 
an offense that I would like to play in and they have a quarterback (John 
Elway) that I definitely wouldn't mind playing with." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown left today for a six-day trip to Hawaii and is not expected to sign 
until his return. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bronco officials stressed their determination to get the wide receiver out 
of silver and black. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't do it if we thought they were going to match it," Denver Coach 
Wade Phillips said. "The reason we'd be after a Tim Brown is because we can't 
cover him. If you can't cover him, sign him. That's our theory." 
</P>
<P>
 In three games against the Broncos last season, Brown caught 20 passes for 375 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer sheet reportedly includes a no-trade clause. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Brown want to see an offer that will discourage the Raiders from 
matching? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah," he said, "most definitely. That's what we're looking to do, to head 
in that manner. I've dealt with Mr. Davis (Raider owner Al Davis) for six 
years, but I'm sure Mr. Bowlen (Bronco President Pat Bowlen) knows him a lot 
better than I do. He thinks he knows the secret (to free Brown)." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton, an unrestricted free agent, signed a two-year, $2.5-million contract 
with the Redskins on Wednesday. Horton, who spent six years with the Raiders, 
had 43 catches last season for 467 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, he is reunited with Terry Robiskie, who was his position coach 
with the Raiders until leaving to join the staff of new Redskin Coach Norv 
Turner.

STEWART LEAVES RAMS FOR DOLPHINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After seven seasons with the Rams, strong safety Michael Stewart has signed a 
three-year, $2.8-million contract with the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, Miami removed the transitional free agent designation from 
safety Louis Oliver, meaning he is eligible to sign with any team. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart will earn $2.2 million in salary plus a $600,000 signing bonus. He had 
started 76 of his 103 games with the Rams, who drafted him from Fresno State in 
1987. Stewart started 14 games in 1993, when he earned $575,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be paid $625,00 next season.

PROBLEMS MOUNTING FOR THE KINGS' MCNALL; BUSINESS: MAGAZINE STORY ALLEGES THAT 
OWNER OF TEAM HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN ART SMUGGLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 King owner Bruce McNall's troubles continue to mount, with a national magazine 
alleging in an upcoming story that he has been deeply involved in international 
art smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 A story in the April issue of Vanity Fair quotes McNall as acknowledging he 
has for years broken export laws of Greece, Turkey, Italy and other 
Mediterranean countries designed to protect rare artifacts from being smuggled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The article by Vanity Fair contributing editor Bryan Burrough, co-author of 
the bestseller "Barbarians at the Gate," calls McNall "one of the friendliest, 
most accessible, most down-to-earth art smugglers in the world." The article 
also says McNall regularly dealt with Robert Hecht, whom Burrough describes as 
a reputed art smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrough also says that McNall-related companies have never been cited or sued 
or charged in any of those countries because he has returned artifacts when 
governments complain and also because of lax U.S. laws in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, McNall said that "others do this every day." 
He added that, "There's a certain amount of truth of the things that happened 
in the past. I myself did very little of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Burrough also alleged that McNall partnerships regularly sell "fresh" coins, 
or coins freshly dug up from the ground that are excavated and smuggled out 
illegally. Said McNall: "We're not there when they're digging it up. I'm not 
there. As long as you buy from a legitimate dealer, where they got it from, I 
have no idea. Things have been sold to every major museum in the world. Is 
there something wrong with them?" 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL declined comment on the article. McNall is the chairman of the NHL's 
board of governors, arguably one of the most powerful positions in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, The Times detailed a number of McNall's recent business problems. 
They include a lawsuit alleging he defaulted on a bank loan, a court order 
obtained by a Hollywood studio attaching McNall assets and late payments on 
bills in his sports empire. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall is currently trying to sell a two-thirds stake in the Kings to 
telecommunications entrepreneur Jeffrey Sudikoff and a partner largely to help 
him pay off Bank of America, which had extended him up to $90 million in loans 
and credit. The Times also reported the bank recently moved the loan to a 
"special assets" unit that deals with loans that are of special concern to bank 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with The Times, McNall has downplayed his business problems, 
which stem from the soft coin market, a high debt load, losses from the Toronto 
Argonaut football team he controls and an inability to exploit the Kings' 
popularity because of an unfavorable lease at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Vanity Fair article, however, McNall is quoted as saying that the coin 
business "is finished. There may come the point when I go under. I can't go on 
financing negative cash flow. With the coin business and the Kings both 
negative -- it's not going to happen today, or tomorrow, but I will go under. 
If something doesn't change, I'm finished."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; PHILLIES' KRUK FACES FURTHER TESTS AFTER CANCEROUS 
TESTICLE IS REMOVED 
</P>

 John Kruk, who powered the Philadelphia Phillies to the National League 
pennant last season, had a testicle removed that was later found to be 
cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruk, 33, will face further tests to determine if the cancer has spread. 
However, it is believed the cancer was confined to the testicle. If there is no 
spread, team physician Phillip Marone said Wednesday, Kruk can expect a full 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Testicular cancer is the most common form of cancer found in young adult white 
males, and one of the most curable. It is diagnosed in about 6,000 patients 
annually in the United States and the disease causes fewer than 400 deaths.

<P>
 A hearing to consider an appeal of The Wicked North's disqualification in last 
Saturday's $1-million Santa Anita Handicap is scheduled for March 19 at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 After The Wicked North was moved from first to fourth by the stewards for 
alleged interference early in the stretch, owner Philip Hersh and trainer David 
Bernstein appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Schwartz was named the hearing officer by the California Horse Racing 
Board. Schwartz also served in that capacity when the connections of Tight Spot 
appealed their colt's disqualification in the 1990 Del Mar Derby. That decision 
was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 After Schwartz hears the matter, he will recommend a decision to the CHRB at 
its next general meeting. The CHRB then makes its decision in executive 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuka was given the victory after the disqualification, but the winner's share 
of the purse ($550,000) is being held in escrow. BOB MIESZERSKISANTA ANITA

IT'S GETTING LATE FOR VENTURA'S TATE; CENTER LEADS QUEST FOR STATE TITLE AFTER 
HAVING WATCHED PIRATES FALL SHORT TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Whitney Houston's taped rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" 
reverberates through the packed Ventura College gym, Michael Tate breaks from 
the ranks shortly before the last words ring out and walks past every teammate, 
slapping and shaking hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Tate nor his teammates exchange anything more during the pregame 
ritual, probably because nothing needs to be said. 
</P>
<P>
 The look of determination on Tate's face speaks volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one of our leaders," said Philip Mathews, the Ventura coach. "That 
intensity is one of the things that impressed me when I saw him play in high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 It also has made him a favorite with the capacity crowds at Ventura home 
games, from those who delight in rocking the place after one of his thunderous 
dunks to the kids who hover near him after games, asking for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a town where the Pirate players are almost cult figures, Tate is dutifully 
revered. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-foot-4 and 210 pounds with a powerfully built body, the sophomore center 
epitomizes the team's motto of "We Play Hard." He hustles down the floor, 
sometimes posting low and blowing around a defender with a quick first step for 
an easy layup or a jam, and always crashing the boards with his outstanding 
leaping ability and power. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate used his muscle and 40-inch vertical leap to average 8.7 rebounds during 
the regular season and grabbed 44 rebounds in three Southern California 
regional games. He helped the Pirates advance to the eight-team state 
tournament that starts tonight and concludes Saturday at the UC Irvine Bren 
Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (34-2), ranked No. 1 in the state, will play a first-round game 
against Cosumnes River (25-9) tonight at 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Tate, the Pirates might not have made it this far. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hard-fought 83-76 victory over Imperial Valley on Saturday that clinched 
a berth in the final eight, Tate had 17 rebounds. He had 13 in a 95-66 stomping 
of Rancho Santiago in the second round and 14 and four blocked shots in a 92-78 
win over Harbor in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is probably the second strongest guy on the team behind (forward) Brandon 
(Jessie)," Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tate, who averaged 10.7 points during the regular season, making sure the 
Pirates reached the state tournament was imperative after watching the team 
stumble when it counted the most the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading Fremont High to the state Division I final his senior season in 
1990-91, Tate enrolled at Ventura, attracted by the program Mathews had built 
and by the serene community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get away from the area I grew up in," Tate said. "It was getting 
kind of rough. There was never any pressure for me to join a gang, but there 
were gangs from other areas that kept coming into our neighborhood. . . . I 
remember when I was in the ninth grade and a bunch of guys confronted me one 
day as I was walking home from school. They wanted to start something but I put 
my feet in motion." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first season at Ventura, the Pirates conked out in the state 
semifinals. He redshirted last season and watched from the bench as the Pirates 
were upset by Columbia, 97-88, in the state final at the University of San 
Francisco. Ventura entered with a 37-1 record but left disappointed for the 
second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being there on the bench the whole season was hard," Tate said. "It came down 
to that last game and I just kept my fingers crossed. I wanted the guys to win 
it so much but I also wanted to be a part of it. I even cried after the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate sat out the season because Mathews wanted him to concentrate on 
accumulating units that would transfer to a four-year school. Besides, the 
Pirates were loaded with Jessie, three-point specialist Calvin Curry (now at 
Oklahoma) and Mike King (Cal State Sacramento) in the front line and freshman 
point guard Joey Ramirez and Stephane Brown (Oregon State) in the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all paying off now," Tate said. "I'm graduating in May. I thank 
(Mathews) for redshirting me one year." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after this season started, however, Tate found himself on the sideline 
again. A stress fracture of the right ankle, suffered in a tournament game at 
Moorpark College in early December, forced him out. He returned about a month 
later, ahead of schedule, and participated in Ventura's school-record 29 
consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Cuesta snapped the streak with a 72-71 victory at Ventura on Feb. 9, the 
Pirates have won five in a row and Tate is hoping the string stretches to eight 
with three more victories in the state tournament. He has played on or seen the 
last three Ventura teams and believes that this unit could be the one that 
finally gives the Pirates their second state title and first since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first season, people really didn't expect us to go as far as we did," he 
said. "I was the tallest guy in the lineup and we didn't have the shooters we 
had last year. But we proved them wrong. I think we have a real good chance of 
winning if everyone stays focused. We have a lot of determination. We just need 
to stay focused." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody will have to remind Tate of that at game time tonight. He'll be ready 
long before the national anthem is over.

 Ventura College, the top-ranked junior college men's basketball team in the 
state, has advanced to the eight-team state tournament for the third 
consecutive season and will open play tonight at 8 against Cosumnes River at 
the UC Irvine Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Pirates win their first-round game, they will play in the semifinals 
Friday at 8 p.m. against the winner of tonight's game between Riverside and 
defending state champion Columbia.The final is Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates (34-2), under Coach Philip Mathews, advanced to the semifinals in 
1992 and lost in the final to Columbia, 97-88, last season. Mathews guided the 
Pirates to the state title in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates are led by 6-foot-5 forward Brandon Jessie (22.5 points and 10.7 
rebounds per game during regular season), 5-10 point guard Joey Ramirez (15.5 
points, 5.9 assists) and 6-4 center Michael Tate (10.7 points, 8.7 rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
 Cosumnes River (22-9) is the only team in the final eight that did not win a 
conference championship. The Chiefs, coached by Jim Clark, finished second in 
the Bay Valley Conference behind Merritt. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Benji Garnett was fifth in the state with a 25.3 scoring average and 
second in three-point baskets with 122. Terrence Richardson, a 6-6 forward, 
averaged 15.4 points and 7.1 rebounds. FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ

 Paul Bottiaux, an assistant for the Cypress men's basketball team the last 
seven seasons, is the new Charger coach, the college announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottiaux, 47, replaces Don Johnson, who announced his retirement last 
month.Johnson, the winningest men's basketball coach in state history, had a 
588-259 record in 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress won two State titles and seven conference titles under Johnson. The 
Chargers were 15-19 and tied for fifth in the Orange Empire Conference last 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not replacing him," Bottiaux said of Johnson. "I'm just the next guy in 
line. Having been in the program, I'm kind of close to the tradition that Don 
(and assistant Jack Long) established here. I feel like I'm part of the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottiaux coached the Sonora boys' basketball team for 10 years before coming 
to Cypress. STEVE KRESAL

ANN CONWAY: REAL STORIES ARE BEHIND THE SCENES; CHARITY EVENTS ARE NOT ALL A 
WHO'S-WHO FORUM TO SEE AND BE SEEN. MOST VOLUNTEERS ARE INVOLVED FOR SUPPORT OR 
TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the world of charity events, benefit organizers are often people who are 
suffering in silence, holding their heads high as they wage their wars against 
the physical or mental calamities that have befallen them or their families. 
</P>
<P>
 With their bright smiles and energetic ways, you'd never guess they were 
battling cancer, for example, or striving desperately to remain tethered to 
reality while a loved one loses his way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine times out of 10 our volunteers are cancer patients who've survived and 
want to give back, or they've lost someone to cancer," says Margaret Edwards, a 
spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society, Orange County region. 
</P>
<P>
 "One 71-year-old volunteer on our marketing committee had cancer, his wife had 
cancer, and now both are volunteering for us. They want to give back the 
support we gave them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another volunteer hopes to raise $200,000 at our upcoming Taste for Life 
benefit. Her passion is the memory of her husband, who died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also have a young man who wants to work on our Great American Smokeout 
because his father died of cancer two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Society events are not all about the buzz, gala gowns and bejeweled necks. 
Most of the people are on the scene for a personal reason. They need support, 
or they want to give something back. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Weir of Tustin is one of those. At the annual theater benefit for the 
Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Orange County on Sunday, she greeted guests 
with a smile and a bright "hello." She cruised the raffle table, oohing and 
ahhing over the items. She dined with gusto and happily applauded the 
performance of "The Fantasticks" at Elizabeth Howard's Curtain Call Dinner 
Theatre in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 And, without self pity, she told the tale of her beloved 39-year-old 
schizophrenic son who is in denial about his illness. "He's on the streets 
right now in Northern California. There's no way to control his illness because 
he won't take his medication -- won't admit he is mentally ill," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 His illness was diagnosed after he graduated from college. "He got a degree in 
physics from USC," Weir said. 
</P>
<P>
 She seldom sees him -- once a year "when he really needs something" or "once 
every other year" when he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite her ongoing pain and frustration, she is surviving. "I keep busy. 
I can't help my son because he refuses help, but my relationship with the 
Alliance for the Mentally Ill has helped me meet people who understand what I 
am going through," she said. "So often people don't understand about mental 
illness. Here, you've got friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Barbara Chilow of Newport Beach. "I have a 35-year-old son who is 
mentally ill," said Chilow, who is president of the alliance board. "He has 
bipolar disorder, a disease that used to be called manic-depressive illness. 
It's one of the more treatable mental illnesses, but it's also very serious -- 
there are major mood swings." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son is doing OK, because he is taking his prescribed medication. "But we 
take it one day at a time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for families with a mentally ill loved one is that the problem 
is "ongoing" Chilow said. "Mental illness is not a minor family crisis. It's 
something that goes on for your entire life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person who is mentally ill in your family is the person who is 
crisis-prone. They are constantly causing crisis or in crisis. That causes a 
lot of family disruption. The main thing we teach the members of our alliance 
is to take care of themselves and be a strong family." 
</P>
<P>
 Both women are candid about their sons' illnesses because they want people to 
understand there is no shamed involved.  
</P>
<P>
 "The two major persistent mental illnesses are schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder," Chilow said. "They are biochemically or organically based. They are 
not something created by the family, a former misconception." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the alliance's goals is to reduce the prejudice that surrounds mental 
illness. "Our movement is not dissimilar from the one where people learn to 
say, 'I am an alcoholic,' " Chilow said. "We want to help overcome the denial 
and stigma of mental illness." 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance serves its 550 members by holding free support group meetings 
(they have 13 support groups); offering housing, transportation and clothing 
assistance, and educating through seminars and literature distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to continue to build our network of community support because we need 
to get the word out that we're here," said alliance director Jeffrey Hovsepian. 
"When people need us, we want them to be able to get to us."

 O ne paradox of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake was that, even as it toppled 
freeways and splintered buildings, it brought us together. Adversity forged 
bonds between a doctor and his patient, a shelter volunteer and a new mother, 
and an animal activist and a puppy.  
</P>
<P>
 Around Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center, they're calling it The Incredible 
Conception. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother-to-be is calling herself just plain lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 As Santa Monica rocked to the aftershocks the day of the quake, she was supine 
in her doctor's office under orders not to budge. A fertilized embryo had just 
been transferred to her uterus -- a delicate procedure normally done in a plush 
hospital room to soft background music. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 31-year-old patient -- a Guadalajara stationery store owner married to 
a gynecologist -- had been preparing six months for this. She wasn't going to 
let an earthquake stop her. Neither was Dr. Richard P. Marrs, the hospital's 
pioneering reproductive endocrinologist. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer could possibly have been postponed one day, Marrs says, but who 
knew what the next day might bring? Beyond 24 hours, the embryos -- which 
couldn't be frozen because the freezing equipment was damaged -- would not have 
been viable. Besides, and this was crucial, the patient's uterus had been 
hormonally prepared to receive the embryo on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that morning, Marrs slipped by security guards blocking entry to the 
hospital and fell in behind firefighters who were climbing the stairs. On the 
fourth floor, he found his in vitro fertilization lab in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the steel incubators were standing, their heating units still working. 
Inside one, were seven donor embryos fertilized by the patient's husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The dishes had bounced around, but in his microscope Marrs saw that five 
embryos -- each the size of a pinpoint -- looked good. 
</P>
<P>
 He tidied the lab, loaded the embryos into a catheter and called his office. 
The woman should go there, he instructed. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who asked for anonymity, remembers being told that the doctor was 
in the lab, "looking for the embryos." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before noon, Marrs wrapped the catheter in a towel and made a 
broken-field dash -- reminiscent of his days as a Texas Longhorn -- down the 
flooded hospital corridors, down the stairs, across 16th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got movin'," he says with a hint of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he ran up two flights to where the woman and her husband waited. "Their 
eyes were like saucers. They were terrified . . . but I don't think anything 
would have stopped them." 
</P>
<P>
 She had undergone premature menopause and an embryo transfer was her only hope 
of giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
 A 5-point aftershock hit as patient, husband and doctor waited two hours to 
give the embryo time to line up with her uterine wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, pregnancy was confirmed. "I was flabbergasted," Marrs says. 
"The stress she was under . . . she wasn't in the best of conditions to 
conceive." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has achieved 1,000 IVF births, the miracle on 16th Street is one of 
his great moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Even under ideal circumstances, when the embryos are in an uncontrolled 
environment for only seconds -- the catheter having been wheeled in an 
incubator to the patient's bedside -- the pregnancy rate is 30-40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Marrs points heavenward: "Somebody was really wanting them to be pregnant." 
</P>

 This is the story of when Sarah met Sarah.  
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Martinez was two days old when her parents, Norma and Juan, brought her 
right from the hospital to a Red Cross earthquake shelter at Santa Clarita 
Valley Boys and Girls Club on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Snyder was a Red Cross volunteer, who had heard that a newborn was 
coming and had made a makeshift bassinet and gathered extra blankets and 
diapers. Later, she'd buy rubbing alcohol and show Norma how to swab the baby's 
umbilical cord. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma recalls: "Sarah had two beds set up for me and my husband and a small 
one for Little Sarah, all decorated, all pink." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, 23, who has a 2-year-old son, says, "I remember going through 
childbirth and how it was for me. I wanted to make sure she had everything, 
like at home, and the baby was safe and secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder held, fed and changed the baby "so Norma could get some rest." That 
wasn't easy, surrounded by several hundred people. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it coincidence that the Martinezes came upon this good Samaritan with 
their daughter's name? 
</P>
<P>
 Norma, 24, and Juan, 28, a church maintenance worker, are devout Christians. 
She says, "I found the name Sarah in the Bible. We liked the name." 
</P>
<P>
 So the baby's name had been chosen before Big Sarah came into their lives. 
When they met her, Norma knew it was "a blessing from God." 
</P>
<P>
 Little Sarah, now a 12-pounder with a shock of black hair, got quite a start 
in life. For three days before she was born, her parents, displaced from their 
apartment, slept in a tent in a park. During Norma's labor, aftershocks rocked 
the hospital in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is back home and Big Sarah has come to baby-sit and to bring gifts 
from well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, Norma hopes, Sarita will want to be baptized when she's older. Maybe 
Big Sarah will be the godmother. "That would be nice," Norma says. 
</P>

 Terri Crisp was a goner the first time she saw the puppy. He was lying in a 
cage at the West Valley Animal Shelter in Chatsworth "with this lampshade thing 
on his head and these 'poor, pitiful me' eyes that just pull you in." 
</P>
<P>
 Crisp, director of disaster services for Sacramento-based United Animal 
Nations, and 45 volunteers had come to rescue earthquake-displaced animals, not 
to adopt them. 
</P>
<P>
 When she left her home in Santa Clara, her husband Ken had these parting 
words: 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not to come home with anything that has four legs, or three legs, or 
two legs . . . " After all, she had returned from the Midwest floods with six 
cats and three dogs to adopt out. (They already had three dogs and seven cats.) 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Crisp says, "It was just like Shaker was talking to me. He 
wanted to tell someone what he'd been through." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaker had been found the day after the quake near the Northridge Meadows 
Apartments and brought to the shelter in bad shape, his left rear leg nearly 
severed. Collarless and malnourished, he was signed in as a beagle-terrier mix. 
But Crisp suspects he may be something bigger, much bigger. Already, he's more 
than doubled in size and he has big feet. 
</P>
<P>
 He's white, with black and brown blotches here and there. Funny-looking, some 
might say. "Really cute," says Crisp -- and smart. 
</P>
<P>
 She plans for him to be the first American dog formally trained to search for 
animals in trouble in the wake of a disaster. "I said, 'Shaker, what better dog 
to do this job? You've been through it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now healed, he is being trained to wear a backpack. Next stop: one of those 
academies that teaches drug-sniffing dogs and people-rescuing dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, graduate school under Professor Crisp. Shaker has all those siblings to 
practice on -- including a a quake-displaced cockatiel dubbed "Eppy" (as in 
epicenter), which Crisp also took home to Santa Clara.

THE AGE OF RAGE; AT NIMITZ MIDDLE SCHOOL, STUDENTS ARE TAKING A COURSE THAT 
COULD SAVE THEIR LIVES: HOW TO CURB ANGER. IN THIS STRUGGLE, EVERYONE WINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just thinking about it made her teen-age blood boil. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom told me to pick up my room, to make my bed, to cook my breakfast, to 
hurry up and put on my shoes -- and I still had to do my hair!" recalled Selena 
Aragon, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouted, 'You know, Mom, I only have two hands. I can't do everything. I'm 
not like you!' " Selena said she ran into her room, flung a photo of her mother 
against a wall and raced out the door, her mother yelling, "No going out after 
school today!" 
</P>
<P>
 Six hours after that argument, Selena was still seething. Her blowups have 
been frequent since her parents' divorce five years ago. Sometimes she wants to 
strike her mom, she recently told other students enrolled in the Think First 
anger-management program at Nimitz Middle School in Southeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated visits to the dean's office have landed them in the seventh-period 
anti-anger sessions, which Nimitz officials believe are the only such classes 
offered within the Los Angeles Unified School District. Parents have given 
their consent and teachers have excused the students from regular classes to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Confessing that she can't keep her dander down, Selena has plenty of company. 
Thirty students are enrolled in the classes, which meet weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the students have circled 10 on an anger scale drawn on the classroom 
board. It ranges from 1, a little bit angry, to 10, out of control. One by one, 
they admitted that more often than they'd like, their adrenaline gets them in 
trouble. They get uptight when they are gossiped about, or, as they say, 
"dissed." They're even angrier when somebody looks at them the wrong way, or as 
they put it, "mad-dogs" them. They lash out by cursing and sometimes slugging. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said they act on their anger by throwing things, kicking things or 
breaking things. Others keep their feelings bottled up. When that happens, 
depression often sets in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anger is a very normal process. You can't restrict anger; it's a message and 
the message is that something is wrong," Floyd McGregor told the group of 
girls. The classroom resembles a den, with sofa, matching chairs and 
overstuffed pillows, which have been punched around since the classes began 18 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor, a clinical psychology doctoral candidate at the California School of 
Professional Psychology, instructs three weekly sessions. Rebecca Behar, a 
psychiatric social worker at Nimitz, helps McGregor with the girls' group; 
Henry Gitler, a staff psychologist, helps with the two boys' sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are separated by gender because the model program was developed 
for boys, Behar said. "Aside from that, it helps to focus students better when 
the groups are not mixed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Lupe Simpson saw a need for the program at Nimitz, the nation's 
second-largest middle school, with enrollment of 3,600. "Think First is 
teaching kids to be responsible for their own behavior because nobody else is 
teaching them," she said. "The kids are learning why and what makes them angry. 
But most of all, they are learning self-control." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 Nimitz students have gone through the 10-to-15-week program, 
developed and co-written by Judy McBride, a Long Beach Unified School District 
psychologist. Results have been positive, Behar said. "Among those students, 
there has been a reduction of referrals to the dean for fights among students. 
At homes, parents have told me that there is less arguing, and in many cases 
grades have improved, which has been an added bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Think First classes, McGregor and counselors boost students' 
self-esteem by giving points for good behavior, class participation and honest 
answers, and rewarding them with popcorn and sodas at the end of each session. 
At the completion of the course, students receive Think First diplomas during a 
ceremony attended by parents who, early on, agree to attend Wednesday night 
parenting classes at which the anger-management program is discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor said students become angry and sometimes violent because they come 
from broken families, stepfamilies and families in which a parent's girlfriend 
or boyfriend has moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many homes," McGregor said, "single parents have lost control." 
</P>
<P>
 He also cites other reasons, such as parents who work long hours or simply 
aren't around enough for their children, the effect of television violence, 
violence at home, poverty and environments of gang violence and drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you've got are some pretty angry teen-agers out there" primed to "act 
out how they feel," McGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that because children are seldom taught how to keep a lid on anger, 
such programs as Think First are important and necessary, especially for 
middle-school students who are at a crucial stage in their development. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are beginning to start to question their own identity, to hang out even 
more with kids their ages. They start to dress differently. They don't want to 
listen to Mom. They question their authority figures" because they are in 
turmoil about making a transition into their teens, McGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often that confusion leads to anger and aggressive behavior, which lands 
students in the dean's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Think First helps students let go of their hostility by helping them identify 
anger triggers, such as their being yelled at, hit, bossed around or 
disrespected, or thinking that they are being laughed at, stared at or talked 
about when they are not, McGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to get the kids to change their negative thought processes by working 
on building their self-esteem. I talk to them about being in control because 
you can be much more powerful by not letting someone get you mad." 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor also shows the youths how to be aware of anger cues or physical 
reactions, such as clenched fists, tightened stomachs and facial tension, which 
can escalate to "a guy or a girl really wanting to hit somebody or kick a desk 
or punch a hole in the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 When that happens, it's time to employ anger reducers, such as deep breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Flores, 13, said her anger is out of hand and hopes the classes will 
help her conquer it. "I get angry every day, three or four times. I show it 
with my face," the seventh-grader said, demonstrating a frown and 
dagger-throwing eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm cleaning my room, my mom goes, 'Yolanda, have you taken your shower? 
Have you eaten? Have you cleaned off the table? Have you done the dishes?' I 
can't take it. I blow up. I hit my little sister. I give her a big old hand. I 
leave her red." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Martinez, 11, a sixth-grader, said her anger has driven her to hit her 
mother in the face. On occasion she's been angry enough to want to hit all her 
teachers, she said, adding that she once kicked an elementary-school teacher 
and was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 She's trying to figure out why she gets angry. She and the others blame 
neighborhood violence, older siblings who put them down and call them 
derogatory names and parents who give them little or no attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria said she's learning how to control her anger because "I don't want to 
get suspended." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does Selena, who says she gets uptight because her brothers call her 
bad names, she's hassled at home, and at school "my teachers get on me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time I keep my anger inside of me," she said. But when it's 
uncontrollable, "I go inside my room and throw everything on the floor. I'll 
sock the walls and it doesn't hurt me cause I'm mad. My mom says, 'Go ahead, do 
it again and I'm going to hit you.' So I do it again. I just explode. I go 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-grader Michelle Morales, 14, said her anger gets the best of her 
because her parents "don't want to listen to me. They would rather believe my 
brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Michelle said, "It feels good coming here because I get to talk about 
my anger and now I know what to do. It's a positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk like that pleases McGregor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are like sponges. Once you teach them something that works and they see 
that it works, they begin to feel positive about themselves." He said positive 
thinking helps build self-esteem, which empowers the students. "And when that 
happens, you can show them how to control their anger." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Sanchez, 15, a recent program graduate, said he has managed to stay calm 
by remembering to use anger reducers and, when necessary, consult a counselor. 
He said that before he took the class he was in so much trouble he was about to 
be transferred to another school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any little thing would set me off. If somebody flipped me off or said 
something about me, I'd go up to them and say, 'Tell it to my face,' and if 
they did it to my face I'd break their jaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Gitler, who recommended the class to Juan, remembered when the 
student was in the dean's office three times a week on a regular basis for 
fighting. His grades were slipping from Cs to Ds. Since he completed the anger 
program, Juan has chalked up five A's and one B, and the fights have stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Think First, we don't talk about grades or homework, only about anger. But 
what he learned seemed to carry over to his classwork," Gitler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan's mother, Gabriela Ramos, recognizes the change in her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to be so rebellious. He had an angry character about him -- yelling, 
never listening, screaming at me when I would be talking to him. He wanted to 
do only what he wanted to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he does his homework. I get on him and he listens and he doesn't get 
angry. He actually does what I would like for him to do." How to Control Anger 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd McGregor, an anger-management consultant at Nimitz Middle School, 
recommends these techniques for reducing anger: 
</P>
<P>
 * Take slow, deep breaths. This relaxes your body and prevents you from 
hyperventilating. 
</P>
<P>
 * Count backward slowly, from 10. Counting helps get your mind off your anger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get a mantra. Repeating phrases such as "kick back," "cool it" or "mellow 
out" has a calming effect and helps refocus anger so it doesn't escalate to 
violence.

EARTHQUAKE STRESS EVEN RATTLES RATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's OK if you think you'll never get used to earthquakes. It's natural to 
become unglued. Biological, even. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that inference might be drawn from the work of Natalie Alexander, a 
USC researcher who studies environmental stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander has subjected laboratory rats to simulated earthquakes to see how 
they react, and found that rats do not adapt to the shaking. They are just as 
stressed-out by their 100th earthquake as they were during the first. 
</P>
<P>
 In three years of research, Alexander has also found that the rats' stress 
increases with the speed of shaking. Some try to escape from their cages. 
</P>
<P>
 She measured the rats' stress by looking at changes in blood pressure, heart 
rate and the release of hormones and neurotransmitters into the blood, which 
are natural defense mechanisms to stress. 
</P>
<P>
 These studies may be applicable to humans, she says, because rats are mammals 
with cardiovascular and hormonal systems very similar to ours. SHARI ROAN

BUDDING MAGAZINE REACHES TO VIET WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The short history of Vietnamese-language publishing in this country has been 
controversial and violent. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, three journalists -- among them a Garden Grove publisher and 
a San Francisco youth group leader -- were killed and a number of others 
injured or threatened for advocating normalization with Hanoi or for publishing 
what were construed as pro-Communist viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 19 years after the war that led to the exodus of 1.5-million Vietnamese 
from their homeland, the winds of change are being felt and, in some circles, 
resignedly accepted. Violence against moderate or liberal Vietnamese 
expatriates is rare. 
</P>
<P>
 This optimism, coupled with President Clinton's decision last month to end the 
trade embargo with Vietnam, has led a group of entrepreneurs to publish the 
first international Vietnamese-language magazine. They hope it will finally 
heal and unite their fractured, exiled worldwide communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Nguoi Viet The Gioi, or Viet & World, the magazine will attempt to 
unite Vietnamese communities by informing expatriates of international news, 
features and personalities as they relate to their culture, heritage and 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Its creators hope Viet & World will become the Newsweek or Time for Vietnamese 
readers living abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine plans to "introduce our people to each other and remind us to 
never forget our roots," says Editor-in-Chief Viet Khanh Nguyen, whose pen 
name, Son Dien, is well-recognized by Vietnamese readers. "And we want as many 
people as possible to have access to this publication." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-thousand copies of the premiere issue are scheduled to hit the stands 
in Little Saigon on Saturday, and 10,000 in Germany the next week. Thereafter, 
more will be printed for other Vietnamese communities in California, other 
states and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the largest Vietnamese enclave outside Southeast Asia, and 
elsewhere in the country, dozens of large and small Vietnamese publications 
come and go. But Nguyen and his partners are optimistic that Viet & World will 
not only thrive, but become the educational and entertainment magazine that 
Vietnamese outside their native country will turn to. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many Vietnamese newspapers in the different communities, but there 
is not one magazine that serves as a voice" for all expatriates, says Ngoan Le, 
board director of UniMedia Corp., which publishes the magazine. "We want to 
become that voice." 
</P>
<P>
 A lofty goal, but not impossible given the reputation and experiences of the 
men and women who have created the colorful, glossy magazine. The seven-member 
board of UniMedia includes Vietnam's premiere actress, Kieu Chinh, and a cadre 
of Vietnamese literati. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the 72-year-old Nguyen, also editor of Westminster's Vietnam Economic 
News and formerly the managing editor of the Vietnam Press News Agency of the 
Republic of Vietnam before the country fell to the Communists in 1975. Another 
is Yen Do, editor of Nguoi Viet Daily, the largest Vietnamese-language daily in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Nguyen's and Do's acknowledged partiality to news with an economic 
slant, board members and staff writers Nha Ca, a novelist, and her husband, 
poet Da Tu Tran, will lend their literary touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Always cognizant of the Vietnamese community's political atmosphere, Viet & 
World will intentionally remain neutral on the most debated and divisive issue 
of the collective Vietnamese community: Should the United States normalize 
relations with the Vietnam government, the next logical step after resumption 
of commercial trade between the two former enemies? 
</P>
<P>
 That neutrality will separate the magazine from most other Vietnamese 
publications. Although Viet & World's directors realize that past moderate 
voices have been met with violence and demonstrations, they say they will not 
be deterred in their mission of objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inside those of us who have had personal experiences with the Communists, 
there will always be a want for revenge," says Ca, who, along with her husband, 
languished in the Vietnam government re-education camp for 12 years because of 
their literary connection during the previous regime. "But we cannot deed our 
bitterness and hatred onto the younger and new generations. It is too heavy a 
burden for them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese publishing in the United States had its genesis with what has 
become the country's largest daily newspaper, the Nguoi Viet Daily. The 
12,000-circulation newspaper began in 1978 in Editor Do's Santa Ana tract home. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few miles away, Viet & World's launch is similarly unassuming. 
</P>
<P>
 Its modest, almost Spartan, newsroom has only three cubbyholes for writers and 
two austere offices, one with a portable desk, the other with three 
all-important desktop computers. There is no copier -- the solo fax machine 
does double duty. In all, there are only five on staff, including Editor 
Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's immediate goal is to prepare all Vietnamese communities for an 
upcoming historical epoch -- April 30, 1995, the 20th anniversary of the 
Communist takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 The first issue is dedicated to this painful, historic commemoration with 
articles reflecting an underlining theme: It's time Vietnamese leave the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Viet & World's long-term aim is to encourage young Vietnamese to learn about 
or to continue to preserve their Asian traditions and culture, a heritage many 
in the older generation lament their children and grandchildren have lost in 
their quest for assimilation. For the younger generation, each issue will have 
articles on Vietnamese traditions and historic events, as well as profiles on 
Vietnamese youths contributing to their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 For other readers, Viet & World -- which also has a smaller English-language 
section -- will have news, business stories and features from the various 
Vietnamese enclaves. "We want to make sure every issue of the Vietnamese 
community is discussed, whether in English or in Vietnamese," said Michael 
Nally, English section editor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most articles in the English version target the younger generation -- youths 
who are not proficient in Vietnamese. Among features in the first issue is 
Nally's question-and-answer with a Garden Grove honor student who writes for 
the student newspaper. Another profiles a Vietnamese boat refugee who is now a 
youth pastor in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The premiere issue, and those following it, will feature stories that run the 
gamut from news on the economy and state of technology, to profiles on the 
lifestyles of the not-always-so-rich-and-famous fellow Vietnamese expatriates. 
For example, one article in the first issue discusses the need for a Vietnamese 
Memorial in Vietnam -- akin to the American Vietnam War Memorial in Washington 
-- to recognize those who died fighting for their country. 
</P>
<P>
 Says actress Chinh, the magazine board president and a member of the memorial 
group: "We want to express our gratitude and love to those who have died for a 
noble cause." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How do the seven UniMedia board members think they can launch an international 
magazine with a paltry $50,000? By pooling their resources, seeking 
contributions of other Vietnamese business leaders and not getting paid 
initially, they confidently reply. In addition, many major French and American 
companies, such as Martell liquor and MCI telecommunications, have committed 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know $50,000 seems like a small sum for this kind of venture," says Chinh, 
who recently appeared in "The Joy Luck Club." "But we don't have to worry about 
the biggest expense, which is printing." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Board Director Ngoan Le, president of Orange-based Annam 
Printing Inc., has donated his press. Le persuaded the owner of a Vietnamese 
printing company in Bonn to publish the magazine for expatriates in Europe. A 
similar agreement is pending in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 To market the magazine to Vietnamese communities, UniMedia has begun 
advertising in a handful of Vietnamese-language newspapers. But most marketing 
initially is being done in a very old-fashioned Vietnamese way: word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing plan is unconventional, Chinh admits, but business people in 
Vietnamese districts in San Jose, San Francisco, Houston, Dallas, Washington 
D.C., France and Germany already know that Viet & World will hit their 
newsstands by month's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may sound different, funny, even impossible, but that's how things 
traditionally work with our people," says Chinh, who's also in charge of public 
relations. "In our case, each of our board members knows people who know other 
Vietnamese in different communities around the world, and all indications show 
that Viet & World will be well-received." 
</P>
<P>
 Some magazine industry experts, however, are not so sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay Felker, a longtime magazine editor and educator, criticizes as 
impractical the very reasons Viet & World's creators cite in explaining the 
need for an international magazine. Felker, who launched the now-defunct New 
West magazine in 1976 after successfully founding New York magazine, believes 
that the worldwide Vietnamese communities are too geographically distanced to 
give Viet & World the circulation it needs to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he says, once assimilated to their new culture, younger generations tend 
not to be interested in magazines published in their native language. Viet & 
World has "a perfectly laudable objective, and publications aimed toward a 
specific community do help to identify common bonds," he says. "But 
traditionally, those publications have not been successful beyond their 
immediate community." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen and his partners acknowledge that they have a long road ahead before 
Viet & World can become entrenched in the collective Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying this will immediately become the Vietnamese Time or 
Newsweek," Nguyen says. "Those companies have money and a foundation of a 
well-known reputation already under them. We are a smaller and poorer group, 
and so we have started much more slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 But he and his lifelong friends and colleagues have dreams and writers. And a 
couple of computers, an expensive printing press and people willing to give 
their time and efforts to begin a magazine for the Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 Those things and the fact that "no one has tried this before," he says, "makes 
this a pretty good start."

 A glow of red and golden lighting transformed the entrance of the Natural 
History Museum into a magnificent Chinese temple for 800 attending the Dinosaur 
Ball and premiere of the "Genghis Khan Treasures From Inner Mongolia" 
exhibition on Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Gongs and drums chased away evil spirits and, to bestow good luck, lion 
dancers pranced with ferocity on the museum steps overlooking Exposition Park's 
Rose Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China, His Excellency Li 
Daoyu and his wife, Yi Zhoalie, joined museum director Craig Black and his 
wife, Elizabeth, and Zhao Zhihong, deputy governor of the Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region, and ball chairs William and Toni Bird in the long receiving 
phalanx. (Li Daoyu and J. Stapleton Roy, American ambassador to China, were 
honorary co-chairs.) 
</P>
<P>
 Closet treasures emerged in the black-tie/international dress of party-goers. 
Inner Mongolia's Deputy Director of Cultural Relics, Wang DaFang, set the tone 
in his elegant silk ceremonial attire worn with a cockily perched black hat.

 Museum devotees scorned well-sprayed hairdos to don audio crowns for the tour 
of treasures, tipping the crowns to greet friends. Ultimately, all converged in 
the three halls for dinner, where decorations chair Lynn Brengle used swords 
atop circles of Mongolian-inspired grass as centerpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese consul general in Los Angeles Wang Xue Xian and his wife, Zhang 
Feng Qun, referred to the exhibit as "but one flower in the garden of flowers 
of China."  
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, curated by Adam Kessler, is considered a milestone in cultural 
exchange, inasmuch as many of the relics have never been seen elsewhere in the 
world, even in China. Catherine Krell, who spent three weeks in Inner Mongolia 
coordinating arrangements, noted the many special touches of the evening -- 
such as the programs starting from the last page in Chinese custom. Tributes 
were paid to China authority Sammy Lee and to the evening's honorary chairs, 
Caroline Ahmanson and David Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent in the crowd were Gareth Chang, Nelson Rising, Ethelda Singer, 
Richard J. Stegemeier, Sylvia Wu, Matthew K. Fong, Los Angeles City Councilman 
Michael Antonovich, all attending as members of the Council of Honor. A ball 
committee including Betty Reddin and Joan Wrede bustled to make sure they were 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 There was ample time for conversation over Chinese shrimp salad, chicken with 
shiitake heads and Chinese cabbage, and rice pudding with Chinese plums. 
</P>
<P>
 Then guests picked up their hand-painted eggs, Yves St. Laurent's Opium eau de 
toilette and Canton ginger liqueurs to huddle under the too-few umbrellas as 
valets rushed valiantly for cars. Plaudits: The Los Angeles World Affairs 
Council's Diplomat of the Year Award went to ambassador of Germany to the 
United States Immo Stabreit at the Four Seasons Hotel Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 At the black-tie affair for members of the council's International Circle, the 
diplomat accepted the etched crystal world map from council chairman Richard J. 
Stegemeier and president J. Curtis Mack II. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Princeton/Harvard-educated ambassador said Germany and the United 
States speak "virtually with one voice" on numerous issues, including democracy 
and the global system of open trade. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Stabreit's first visit to the West Coast. He was accompanied by his 
wife, Barbara. Los Angeles' new German Consul General, Hans Alard Von Rohr, and 
his wife, Catharina, were guests. Joining the head table were Marion and Earle 
Jorgensen and Eli Broad, new World Affairs Council chair, and his wife, Edye. 
</P>
<P>
 More attending were the new chairman of Litton Industries Alton Brann and his 
wife, Anny; former Vatican ambassador William Wilson with his wife, Betty; Jean 
Smith; Norman and Erlenne Sprague; Tamotsu and Noriko Yamaguchi, and Tom Jones. 
A Million: The thrills surrounding the October opening of the Center for the 
Performing Arts at the Civic Arts Plaza (located at the intersection of U.S. 
101 Ventura Freeway and the Route 23 Thousand Oaks Freeway) got a big boost on 
a gloriously sunny day last week at Lake Sherwood Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 A surprise $1-million gift from the Los Angeles Times/Times Mirror Foundation 
was announced by Jeffrey S. Klein, Los Angeles Times president, San Fernando 
Valley and Ventura editions. Klein presented a first-installment $100,000 check 
to Chuck Cohen, chairman of the Alliance Campaign. The $1 million is the 
largest single donation to the Civic Arts Plaza Endowment Fund to date and 
brings pledges to $3.5 million. This will likely lead to a new goal of $10 
million, according to Stephen D. Woodworth, chairman of the Alliance for the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The $63.8-million center will provide world-class facilities for entertainment 
and culture. It will consist of an 1,800-seat auditorium and a 400-seat forum 
theater, and is designed to serve the more than two million people living in 
the area from the Valley to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Mayor Elois Zeanah and Tom Mitze, Performing Arts Center 
executive director, announced the entry plaza will be named The Times Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Founders Circle chairman Larry Janss paid tribute to members of the Founders 
Circle (gifts of $50,000) lunching at the event hosted by Gordon Binder of 
Amgen. Prominent were Ann Janss, Bill Janss, Deborah Duclon, Mary Ann and Bill 
Bang, Fred Raio (president of First State Bank of the Oaks), Vicky and Raymond 
Poliakin and Kirsten Lundring. Also in the crowd were Marshall and Gretchen 
Milligan and Luther Luedtke, president of California Lutheran University. Past 
Perfect: A dinner at Chasen's Mariana and Frank Rothman hosted honoring 
newlyweds Fiorenza (Courtright) and Chief Justice of the California Supreme 
Court Malcolm Lucas, married in October . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At the American Youth Symphony concert Sunday, conductor Mehli Mehta, 
suffering from pneumonia, conducted the orchestra while seated and 19-year-old 
Russian violin virtuoso Maxim Vengerov starred in the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion. Later, AYS co-presidents Mitzi Eisenberg, Betty Roach and Claire 
Sacks, and Norma Brecher, chairman of the board, staged a post-concert dinner 
upstairs at the Music Center . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Champagne toasts celebrating the victory of Stuka in the $1-million Santa 
Anita Handicap were proposed to owner Allen Paulson of Beverly Hills by 
Clifford C. Goodrich, Santa Anita president. Then Paulson's wife, Madeleine, 
revealed it was her birthday and she wouldn't mind the horse for a gift.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT; EQUALITY AND RESPECT ARE 
TOP REQUESTS BY STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE GRAC; SARAH UBER, IMONS, ; SHARON SHEN, Stephanie Grace, Sarah 
Uber and Sharon Shen are students at Villa Park High School. This article first 
appeared in the student newspaper, the Oracle. Results of the student poll were 
tabulated by students Angela Bergmann, Laura Fauteux, Mae Hsu, Jennifer Maresh 
and Kara O'Brien. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disrespect has many faces, a survey of students at Villa Park High School 
found. It can show itself in an attitude, a remark, a look. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how disrespect is most often expressed, students said 49% of the 
time it is verbally, 35% of the time through body language and attitude and 16% 
of the time physically. 
</P>
<P>
 That finding was among results of a schoolwide poll that sought to determine 
student attitudes about the state of dignity and respect on campus. The survey 
was conducted in English classes in November and December. 
</P>
<P>
 Students surveyed said they most wanted to be treated equally. They said signs 
of equal treatment include "fairness," "no favoritism," "not being put down" 
and "not being judged by stereotypes of religion or race." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe being treated with dignity is not being treated especially good or 
bad. I expect to be treated just like everyone else, with the respect every 
single human deserves," Jonathan Gibbs said.  
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly simple actions show respect, students said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Respect isn't always displayed correctly," Dan Russell said. "You should show 
respect to those who deserve it, not because they own a letterman's jacket or 
the best car or (have) the most money." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Viet agreed: "Dignity is being treated with the same respect other 
people receive. It is having your ideas listened to without judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the smallest things can make the biggest difference. "I consider 
being treated with dignity (to be) giving someone space when they're down and 
just basically being friendly," Steve Roach said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If someone holds the door for someone else, that is respect," Shawn Webber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, small and perhaps even unintentional remarks can take a heavy toll. 
Comments were reported to make up half of disrespectful behavior either 
witnessed or experienced by students. Examples frequently mentioned include 
name calling, talking back and racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, comments that are intended to be funny can be offensive. Girls 
especially feel insulted when, as Kryss McKeon-Cawley said, "guys use us as 
playthings, and they don't think we have feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 A perceived attitude and body language can also send powerful signals of 
disrespect. "Rolling of eyes," giving "bad looks," "walking away," "not 
listening" or simply "ignoring" others come across as degrading, the survey 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Overt physical behavior amounts to only a small percentage of the concerns 
expressed in the survey. However, strong condemnation was registered against 
spitting, pushing, vandalizing and smoking.  
</P>
<P>
 "Graffiti and other vandalism makes me sick. Why would people want to (make) 
cities look like trash?" Ryan Chevalier asked. 
</P>
<P>
 As Colin Hall said: "I feel running around school behaving like monkeys while 
using bad language shows a lack of respect for others. Most want school to be a 
calm, cool, learning place, not a jungle gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students felt that nothing can be done to increase the level of respect 
and dignity given to students on campus. They cited "tradition," "habit" and 
"that's just the way it is" as reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no easy solution, if approached on an individual level, 
conditions may gradually improve, students said.  
</P>
<P>
 Small steps suggested include "listening to others" and "forgiving their 
faults." Jennifer Shen suggested students should "refrain from embarrassing one 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Ayala Younger said: "I think that people have to trust others more and 
think about what they say or do beforehand."

 Jeffrey McFerson, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, El Dorado 
</P>

 "The majority population at Anaheim High consists of what society calls 
minorities. Unfortunately, the African Americans, Asians and Latinos are not 
learning about their culture. In U.S. history classes, students rarely hear 
positive things about the African Americans, Asians and Latinos. Everyone 
should have the opportunity to learn about themselves. That is why I suggest an 
ethnic studies class. Race relations would improve because everyone would get a 
better understanding of one another." 
</P>

 Renee M. Poole, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 "The size of Loara makes it very hard for teachers, counselors and 
administrators to know their students. Though some do take time and care, there 
is still a gap in the relationship between students, and there should be more 
role models."

<P>
 Faith Friedman, 17

 About 80 science students from Corona del Mar and Newport Harbor high schools 
are getting up close and personal with the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 They are participating in Quiksilver Teach & Test, an eight-week pilot program 
to conduct water testing at 12 locations from Reef Point to the Santa Ana River 
jetty.The project is run by the Newport Beach chapter of the Surfrider 
Foundation and the Newport Beach Sunrise Rotary Club. Quiksilver, a surfwear 
manufacturer in Costa Mesa, is sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are charting non-point pollution, which accounts for more than 80% of 
ocean water pollution. The project is designed to raise awareness about the 
fact that anything that goes into a storm drain goes directly to the ocean, 
Surfrider chairman Ryan Kelly said. Teachers supervising the project were 
trained in water-testing procedures by Surfrider representatives. Results will 
be announced in mid-April.

 Discrimination can come in many forms: race, sex, age, religion, culture, 
appearance. Maybe it has happened to you. Maybe you've witnessed an act of 
discrimination. Maybe you've acted with prejudice yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Alamitos High School, Inter-Cultural Leadership Retreats are helping 
students become more aware and sensitive to an increasingly diverse society. 
</P>
<P>
 Student volunteers are selected to attend periodic retreats to grapple with 
breaking down the walls of prejudice, racism and misunderstanding. Fifteen to 
20 students at time gather to share ideas at the daylong sessions held 
off-campus. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Alamitos faculty member acts as facilitator, leading the exercises and 
group discussions. Help comes from two student trainers who have previously 
attended a retreat and are involved with the school's service club Griffins 
With a Mission.  
</P>
<P>
 At the retreats, which are conducted at a church facility in Cypress, students 
go through exercises to help them discover their own prejudices and to learn to 
deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 One exercise involves students being assigned to wear labels that identify 
them as HIV Positive, Cheerleader, ASB Member, Gang Member and Invisible. The 
catch? They are not told which label is on their back. Based on how others 
react, the students have to guess who they are portraying. Afterward, the 
students break into groups by label and discuss how they were treated and how 
the exercise made them feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos sophomore Jason Beamis, labeled Invisible, recalled how "a girl 
who was a head taller than me kept bumping me into a wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch gives the students a chance to talk informally. Pizza and sandwiches are 
donated by community groups and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raising efforts by Griffins With a Mission have covered retreat costs, 
which include paying for a substitute for the supervising teacher, 
transportation and supplies. Twenty to 25 retreats a year are held at a cost of 
about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A need for the retreats was recognized last year after white supremacist 
literature was placed in lockers on the school campus.  
</P>
<P>
 The retreat idea was developed by a Human Relations Task Force formed by 
principal Carol Hart. English and drama teacher Judy Trujillo, who heads 
Griffins With a Mission, organizes the retreats and prepares students to be 
trainers. Also assisting in setting up the retreats has been Carolyn 
Novello-Herrera of the Orange County Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 students have gone through the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Yoko Tanaka said the retreats "encourage the beneficial effects of 
cultural awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Ploessel, a freshman, learned "that everyone is prejudiced against 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, students are bused from the church back to Los Alamitos 
High School. "We don't expect to make drastic changes in the span of one day -- 
but we hope to make students more aware, more sensitive; we hope to open their 
eyes and begin to make a difference," Trujillo said.

 You're sitting in class taking a test. It's quiet -- except for the growling 
coming from your stomach.Don't worry. It's just your stomach trying to digest 
your food. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when you haven't eaten for a while, your stomach, a big muscle, has acid 
in it, which helps soften food and kill bacteria. The stomach also holds 
enzymes and air. So when there's no food in the stomach, all that liquid and 
air swishing around can make strange noises. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of times, though, the noise isn't coming from your stomach; it's coming 
from your intestines. Food gets pretty noisy passing from your stomach into 
this passageway, so you hear growling sounds -- and, unfortunately, so does 
everyone else.

INK / PAUL D. COLFORD: JUST THE RIGHT TIME FOR A NEW MAGAZINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year around this time, journalism professor Samir A. Husni steps forward 
to announce how many new magazines vied for space on the crowded newsstands 
during the previous year. In 1993, the University of Mississippi mag maven 
says, there were 789 new books -- the largest number he's seen in nine years of 
monitoring the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Every cause, hobby, lifestyle and sexual persuasion has a magazine as 
publishers seek to define audiences narrowly enough so as to be indispensable 
not only to these readers, but also to corresponding groups of advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an especially busy period for start-ups. In the next few days, three 
new publications will emerge, giving further evidence that there's always room 
for another magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Poz -- slang for HIV positive -- is a new lifestyle and service bimonthly for 
patients, relatives and friends leading AIDS-affected lives. The April / May 
premiere, scheduled for release on Tuesday, presents a frank cover profile of 
Ty Ross, a former Los Angeles fashion model who is HIV positive and also 
happens to be Barry Goldwater's grandson.  
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Bob Hattoy, the outspoken AIDS adviser to the Clinton 
administration, accuses the White House of lulling people with AIDS "into a 
false sense of dream-like, utopian hope."  
</P>
<P>
 A back-of-the-book section, "Poz Partner," lays out practical advice on 
health-related clubs, newsletters and overseas travel restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Poz combines the slick, the probing and the helpful in a clean package shaped 
by design director J. C. Suares, who was responsible for the look of 7 Days, 
the now-defunct New York weekly. Sean O'Brien Strub, publisher and executive 
editor, says the start-up represents an investment of several hundred thousand 
dollars -- a sum that will soar as he follows through on plans to mail 70,000 
unsolicited copies of Poz' 100,000-copy print run to AIDS-affected households. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old Strub, who is HIV positive, has sold a life insurance policy 
to help launch Poz. "The magazine is being done as a business," he says, "but 
it's unlikely that it will break even in my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Mouth2Mouth is aimed at older teen-agers by Time Inc. Ventures, a magazine 
development division of Time's ink empire. Scheduled to reach newsstands on 
Monday, the celeb-driven Mouth2Mouth features Shaquille O'Neal and Cindy 
Crawford pawing each other on the premiere cover, joking with each other on a 
pullout poster and talking to each other on four other pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouth2Mouth is graphically busy -- a let's-have-fun assemblage of star-gazing 
puffery (Adam Sandler, Ashley Hamilton), unexpected finds (a first-person 
confession from prison inmate Amy Fisher, who says she did it all "in the name 
of love") and filler, such as "How to Spot Fake Breasts Without Squeezing." 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Beverly Hills, the magazine was founded by editor-in-chief Angela 
Janklow Harrington, a former Vanity Fair writer and daughter of literary super 
agent Morton L. Janklow. It enters an especially competitive field that 
includes YM and Seventeen, as well as Welsh Publishing's new Quake and Hachette 
Filipacchi U.S.A.'s new Tell. Time Inc. Ventures reportedly has scheduled a 
second issue for late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 EcoTraveler is designed to reach environmentally conscious vacationers. In the 
March / April premiere, Peter Matthiessen reports on a visit to Siberia's Lake 
Baikal region; other pieces showcase the rugged beauty of Labrador and a lush 
Virgin Islands resort where the sheets are made from organic cotton processed 
without dyes or bleaches and the carpet from recycled plastic containers. 
</P>
<P>
 EcoTraveler, published by Skies America International Publishing & 
Communications, based in Tualatin, Ore., will publish every other month through 
1994 and switch to a monthly schedule next year.  
</P>
<P>
 West Point, Bad and Good: Collier Books has published a trade paperback 
edition of John F. Marszalek's "Assault at West Point," the basis for 
Showtime's new made-for-cable movie about the 1880 court-martial of Johnson 
Whittaker, one of the first blacks admitted to the U.S. military academy. The 
book was originally published in 1972 as "Court-Martial" by Charles Scribner's 
Sons, and was long out of print. 
</P>
<P>
 In what may be less a trend than a coincidence, the legacy of West Point is 
also explored in three new titles. "The West Point Way of Leadership" 
(Doubleday / Currency) by Col. Larry R. Donnithorne (Ret.), a former strategic

BOOK REVIEW MEMOIR; BOY'S STORY HINTS AT THE PASSION OF YOUTH; STAND BEFORE 
YOUR GOD BY PAUL WATKINS ; RANDOM HOUSE $21, 240 PAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is not always necessary to be old to write a childhood memoir, but Paul 
Watkins may be too young to write this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins tells of the events during his years in English boarding schools; 
sometimes he tells of the emotions he felt at the time. What is almost entirely 
missing is the master emotion that drives the act of memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Childhood has no real biography or autobiography. The facts are too incipient 
and unwilled to stand by themselves. It can, on the other hand, be the occasion 
for a memoir: a dialogue between the remembering adult and the remembered 
child. It is a journey, not a tour, and the writer is a traveler, not a 
tourist. A need compels it -- to discover in the past what is not yet known 
about the present. If the great childhood memoirs seem golden, it is this need 
that lights them up -- like a cave-explorer's torch that picks the gleam of 
metal and quartz out of the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 At 30, the author of novels set in three vastly different worlds -- one in 
Morocco, one among New England fishermen, and the third among German soldiers 
in World War II -- Watkins keeps childhood at a distance. He writes of himself 
without intimacy, as if he were his own invented character. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the beginning of "Stand Before Your God." At 7, living with his American 
family in England, Paul is dressed up in a new blue corduroy suit and taken by 
his father to a large house in Oxford. There is food and a collection of other 
boys, and Paul wanders about with a pack of cards showing off his tricks. His 
father shakes his hand and leaves; Paul goes up to the host and compliments him 
on the "neat party." The man squats. "I am Mr. Vicker and I am your house 
master," he tells the child. "From now on you must call me 'sir.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The image is rending -- a child dropped without warning down a well -- yet 
Watkins makes it suspect. "I swear I thought I was going to a party," he tells 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt he did partly think so; no doubt his mother and his father, a 
professor of geophysics, had told him about the school he was to be sent to; no 
doubt he had blocked out a good deal and was confused. Telling it this way, 
though, Watkins calls attention less to the child's emotion than to the 
aesthetics of his emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins attended the Dragon School in Oxford until he was 12; after that, he 
went to Eton where he remained until he graduated and entered Yale. For 
vacations, he returned to his family's home in Rhode Island. In neither world 
did he feel he belonged, he tells us in the book's main bit of introspection. 
"I began to feel like the governor of a mid-Atlantic island with a population 
of one," he writes gracefully. "Sometimes I wrote stories so as to increase the 
number of people on my mid-Atlantic island." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, "Stand Before Your God" tells of the tightly enclosed and 
ritual-bound world of the primary school, and the somewhat larger enclosures 
and rituals of Eton. His first night at Dragon featured the confiscation of his 
teddy bear by the main boy, who threw it out the window. Once recovered, it was 
respected; all the boys kept stuffed animals. As an American, Watkins was held 
in some derision until he bloodied his face stopping a soccer ball. Blood was 
respected and -- nicknames holding the mysteries of hierarchy -- he graduated 
from being Watty Dog to plain Watty. 
</P>
<P>
 There were beatings -- though a particularly heavy-handed master was dismissed 
-- dormitory raids, midnight feasts, ordeals of various kinds and, when 
graduation approached, a sense that the next step would be less safe. It was. 
</P>
<P>
 Eton was harsher and odder. History weighed heavily, and so did the class 
system. Paul's best friend was a comically pompous junior aristocrat whose 
clothes were ancient and shabby and admired for their lineage -- Lobb's, Asser 
and Turnbull and so on -- by upperclassmen. Paul and his fellows made breakfast 
for the senior prefects, laid out their clothes and, one evening, lugged in a 
garbage can full of snow so that the older boys could have a snowball fight in 
the common room. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a little sex and quite a few crushes, with older boys adopting 
pretty younger ones. Watkins rejected an advance or two, worked hard and tried 
to write. His grades and his writing lagged during his father's long siege with 
cancer; after his death, Watkins felt a kind of freeing. 
</P>
<P>
 The author's portrait of English boarding-school life is reasonably vivid in 
its detail, though a lot of the detail is very familiar. The subject has been 
much -- and much better -- treated. Even when he is recalling his vacations at 
home, his friends and his dying father, Watkins writes with stiffness and 
distance. Perhaps memory will someday become a passion; at the moment, it is an 
assignment.

MY TURN; OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; POLITICAL CORRECTNESS CAN BLUNT THE 
POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT McLENDON, Robert McLendon is a senior at Capistrano Valley High 
School in Mission Viejo. This article first appeared in the student newspaper, 
the CVHS Times.

 Take your turn in My Turn, a place to voice your thoughts, stands and opinions 
-- whether serious or funny. Send your piece along with your name, age, 
address, phone number, school, class level and a recent picture to OC 
High-View, Los Angeles Times, 1375 Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, CA 92626. Once 
seen as a symbol of tolerance, "political correctness" is increasingly being 
criticized as excessive and restricting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 People from opposing sides of the political spectrum now seem interested in 
halting extremes of politically correct policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Political correctness, or PC, began in liberal circles as a way of thinking 
and speaking in order to reduce prejudices. In effect, PC codes and policies 
eliminate blunt, possibly insulting speech.  
</P>
<P>
 But to many, PC has become humorless jargon that limits people's actions and 
speech. PC critics point to Antioch University's recently enacted "sex code" as 
an example of unreasonable limitations PC policies can place on supposedly 
spontaneous activities. The Antioch code is intended to reduce the incidence of 
date rape and sexual harassment, primarily by dictating that partners must 
request specific permission for any form of physical contact. For example: "May 
I kiss you?" "May I put my hand there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, such as Capistrano Valley High School senior Kevin Hagan, are 
critical of what they see as a liberal bias in the terminology. "I think PC is 
just a euphemism for talking about liberal values, things that are accepted by 
liberals . . . (values) that are propagated by the media that are supposed to 
be the (average) of what America thinks, when in actuality I think they are, a 
lot of times, the opposite of what America thinks," Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erich Ludwig, a Capistrano Valley senior who describes himself as on "the left 
side of moderate," says, PC "is a good idea, but it has gone too far. People 
have become a little bit too sensitive. . . . I believe that people should be 
polite to each other, but with PC, people are being forced to be polite." 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig adds, "A sort of fog surrounds PC. By skirting the real issues of the 
world, through PC things become muddled. People don't say what they mean to 
say, so it causes miscommunication. People are starting to feel resentful, 
because they'd like to know what's really going on instead of having the truth 
shrouded from them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, sensitivity to the variety of people that one meets is a good idea, 
even if for purely pragmatic reasons. Certain words are clearly offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when "lazy" become "differently motivated" and "women" must be 
spelled "womyn" to avoid the syllable "men"), things have gone too far.

MY TURN; OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; HUNGRY? MTV HAS FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KWOK, Richard Kwok is a senior at Westminster High School.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Take your turn in My Turn, a place to voice your thoughts, stands and opinions 
-- whether serious or funny. Send your piece along with your name, age, 
address, phone number, school, class level and a recent picture to OC 
High-View, Los Angeles Times, 1375 Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, CA 92626. 
There's a new trend appearing on MTV: food in group names. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no reason why there shouldn't be. Things that appeal to your tummy 
should appeal to your mind. A name is supposed to best describe a rock group, 
right? But there's no rock-solid rule that a name can't have taste (or smell). 
With America turning to food while still being weight conscientious, there is a 
psychological link between hearing and tasting. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm pretty sure that these names aren't made up spontaneously. I mean, the 
group probably didn't decide it while they were eating. But then again, I can 
imagine Meat Loaf asking what's for dinner, the reply "meatloaf," and then 
"Hey, that'll be my name, Meat Loaf." So maybe there's a story behind the name, 
maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's say for dinner you're having Meat Loaf, with Cranberries sauce. The 
Meat Loaf lacks punch, so you throw on some Red Hot Chili Peppers. Then you add 
a dash of Salt-N-Pepa.  
</P>
<P>
 The soup is really hot so you drop in an Ice Cube, while eating a Cracker. 
Tempted for a snack you eat a box of Lemonheads, and finish dinner off with a 
refreshing Blind Melon. You're still hungry so you eat a snack of Smashing 
Pumpkins seeds and top the whole meal off with Gin Blossoms rather than a Bud 
Light. 
</P>
<P>
 I think you can see my point. So while watching MTV, think about it. Think 
about how a name makes a group more noticeable. I did, and so should U2.

HAUTE LINKS CONQUER AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALE CURRY, Curry is food editor of the Times-Picayune in New Orleans.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not a decade ago, Louisiana sausages were regional treats: Cajuns snacked on 
hot boudin , cooks along the river seasoned their gumbos with andouille from a 
few local butchers, and New Orleanians sandwiched their hot, smoked and Italian 
sausages in French bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, andouille is a household word in California and might just as easily be 
heard in Kansas or Washington. Boudin too has reached the masses, and sausages 
generally have gotten hotter and more highly seasoned nationwide as part of the 
fallout of the Cajun craze of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are all sorts of variety today," says John A. Manda, president and 
chief executive officer of Manda Fine Meats in Baton Rouge, La. For years, 
smoked pork was the basic ingredient of sausage made in Louisiana. "I don't 
remember anything else until about five years ago," Manda says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Manda distributes a variety of sausages in 26 states as the taste for the 
spicy food items has spread throughout the country. "Ours are more seasoned 
than sausages from other parts of the country, and people love flavor; I don't 
care what they're buying," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisianians flavor their sausages with many seasonings -- green onion, 
cheese, barbecue sauce. And the changes haven't stopped there. Most sausages 
are getting leaner, some with only 10% fat; many have a fat content of 15% to 
25% (new labels cite percentages). And many are made partly of chicken or 
turkey in addition to pork and beef. Manda says that sausage sales are booming, 
partly perhaps because they're now leaner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And Louisiana chefs share credit with Cajun/Creole cooking shows on television 
for making sausages best-sellers. "John Folse, Justin Wilson, Paul Prudhomme 
have made (Louisiana sausages) popular," Manda says. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn Schmitt, a member of the family that owns Creole Country, a Louisiana 
sausage factory, says that andouille and tasso , a smoked seasoning meat, are 
popular in pastas and other upscale dishes in restaurants everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmitt cites health concerns as a factor in his business. "I'm selling more 
turkey than I used to," he says. "People come in here with heart problems and 
they can order 10 pounds of turkey sausage with no salt." Schmitt, who makes 
heart-healthy sausages for a local hospital, says allspice and other seasonings 
are used in place of salt. "It still tastes good," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of sausage-making, Peter Giovenco described himself as a sort of 
subcontractor. The St. Rose, La., butcher takes in wild game from hunters and 
makes sausage from it -- duck, rabbit, seafood, turtle, alligator -- even 
rattlesnake sausage. "I do what most people don't want to do," he says. "If 
somebody wants wine and cheese or nuts or raisins (in the sausage), I'm the guy 
that's going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Giovenco combines pork and the wild game of choice with Louisiana seasonings 
that he blends himself. The seasonings, he says, make the difference. In 
addition to pepper and spices, Giovenco usually adds onions, green onions and 
parsley to sausage. Some Italian sausage calls for anise or fennel seeds, 
depending on what the customer wants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Louisiana butcher for 29 years, Giovenco says sausage tastes have long 
varied from community to community. "Italian sausage varied from Chalmette to 
Baton Rouge," he says. "Everybody had an idea about how to make it. Some put 
parsley and green onion in it, some put anise, and others, fennel seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 " Boudin was made for years primarily by country people. It's the same thing 
as Cajun rice -- just cooked rice, pork and liver. They slaughtered a hog and 
used the casings to stuff the sausage. They didn't throw away anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the snouts were used back then, and rice was used to pad the meat scraps 
and liver that produced boudin , he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Andouille, he recalls, was "a souped-up smoked sausage with about a 5% to 95% 
ratio of fat to lean." A highly seasoned product, it was made in the country, 
especially in the LaPlace, La., area. Dubbed the Andouille Capital of the 
World, LaPlace still is the home of some of the best andouille, although the 
sausage is now made throughout the state and in other states as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Louisiana we don't have rules when it comes to food," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe nutria sausage, Giovenco says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For a mini-boucherie at home, here's how to make your own sausage. Add your 
seasonings to meat, then take a small portion and cook in skillet until done, 
then taste and adjust seasonings.  
</P>
<P>
 FRESH OR SMOKED PORK SAUSAGE 
</P>
<P>
 Pure pork, such as boneless Boston butt

</P>
<P>
 Black peppers 
</P>
<P>
 Casings 
</P>
<P>
 Grind or have butcher grind pork to medium grind.  
</P>
<P>
 To pure pork, add 6 parts salt, 3 parts cayenne pepper, 1 part white pepper 
and 2 parts black pepper. Add enough water to make loose stuffing. Stuff into 
casings. Tie into links, if desired, forming ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Casings are available from butchers. And some butchers will grind, 
season, mix and stuff your sausage into casings. COOKED FRESH PORK SAUSAGE WITH

 Keep Fresh Pork Sausage in refrigerator or freezer. When ready to cook, place 
in heavy skillet and cover with water. Cook on medium-high heat until water 
disappears, about 45 minutes. Let sausage brown, turn and brown on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove sausage from skillet and make gravy by deglazing skillet with water, 
onions, green peppers and celery to taste. Return sausage to skillet, making 
sure water is about halfway up sausage links. Cover and cook on low heat about 
1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 To thicken gravy, add spoonful of dark roux (cooked mixture of flour and fat) 
at end. Sprinkle with finely chopped green onions and parsley to taste. Can be 
served over yellow grits for breakfast or fresh-smothered potatoes for lunch. 
SMOKED PORK SAUSAGE 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh Pork Sausage 
</P>
<P>
 Place Fresh Pork Sausage over indirect heat in covered charcoal grill. Coals 
should be on 1 side of grill and sausage on other. Add green twigs or branches, 
such as pecan or oak, to coals and smoke 4 to 6 hours. Make sure coals are 
completely covered with branches and logs that are sized to suit grill. 
</P>
<P>
 Close off air vents to grill with maximum smoke and to keep branches from 
catching fire. If branches are freshly cut, they do not have to be dampened. 
Keep grill covered throughout smoking time. It is best not to open grill. 
Sausage is done when internal temperature reaches 155 degrees. BOUDIN

ARE THE DOG DAYS HERE FOR ARSENIO?; TELEVISION: THE FUTURE LOOKS UNCERTAIN FOR 
THE SYNDICATED TALK-SHOW HOST AFTER A DROP IN THE RATINGS THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of a prominent Los Angeles public-relations agency was talking this 
week with a colleague about the best talk shows on which to showcase one of 
their celebrity clients. The name of late-night host Arsenio Hall came up. 
</P>
<P>
 The "buzz," they agreed, was not good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ratings on Arsenio are down this year," said the executive. "In this 
business, we deal with perception all the time, and the perception is that when 
it comes to late night, it's just a two-person race between (David) Letterman 
and (Jay) Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 That perception is growing among some public-relations executives, advertising 
buyers and studio executives. They believe that declining ratings, controversy 
over the recent appearance of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, growing 
late-night competition and Hall's contract running out this year may mean that 
"The Arsenio Hall Show" is on its last legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount, which syndicates the 5-year-old series, denies that the show is in 
trouble and says Hall is still attracting a young audience that advertisers 
want to reach. Hall declined to be interviewed, but he has traditionally prided 
himself on being the underdog in the late-night arena and said he would 
continue for the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 According to A.C. Nielsen figures, Hall's ratings plunged 24% from January, 
1993, to January, 1994, from 2.9 to 2.2, and the number of stations carrying 
his show dropped from 184 to 160. In the same period, Leno's ratings on NBC's 
"The Tonight Show" dropped 4%, from 4.8 to 4.6 -- still double Hall's audience 
-- while Letterman's jump from his 12:35 a.m. NBC show to the 11:35 p.m. "Late 
Show" berth on CBS resulted in a 115% increase in viewership, from 2.7 to 5.8. 
(Each point represents 942,000 homes.) 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been slippage since 1990, and nothing seems to be turning it around," 
said one advertising buyer for syndicated shows. "The show is just not that hot 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The negative speculation about the show's future was further fueled this week 
when KCOP-TV Channel 13 announced that it would bump Hall next month from 11:30 
p.m. to midnight, using reruns of "Night Court" at 11:30 instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last three years, the show has dropped in terms of its ability to 
generate advertising revenue for our station," said KCOP general manager Rick 
Feldman. He added that reruns of "Roseanne," which precede Hall at 11 p.m., 
"were doing quite well and we felt we needed another sitcom to follow 
'Roseanne.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Several show business insiders said that while Letterman's Top 10 list or 
Leno's jokes may be fodder for discussion around water coolers, there is little 
talk of Hall's monologues the next day. Indeed, the biggest stir that Hall has 
caused in several months may have resulted in a backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's highly publicized appearance during the critical February sweeps 
did not help Hall's ratings or the perception that he was in trouble and in 
need of a hook to draw viewers. Although national figures for the Feb. 25 
appearance alone were not available, "The Arsenio Hall Show" averaged a 2.3 
rating for the week, which is consistent with its usual rating. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hall, once very accessible to the media, refused to talk to 
journalists about the Farrakhan booking, either before or after the show. He 
also barred the press from the taping, with spokespersons explaining that Hall 
wanted to have a "normal" atmosphere for the taping. He was criticized for not 
asking Farrakhan pointed questions about his views toward Jews or about 
anti-Jewish remarks by one of Farrakhan's former aides. Jewish organizations 
and several celebrities, including Whoopi Goldberg and Tom and Roseanne Arnold, 
said they were troubled by what they saw as an uncontested forum for Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about Hall and his future is likely to intensify in the coming 
months. His contract with Paramount expires at the end of the year, and there 
will be additional late-night competition come fall from two new syndicated 
series, MCA's "Last Call" and Columbia TriStar's "The Newz." It's possible he 
could fold the tent to pursue other show business interests, such as acting or 
producing motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several studio officials and public-relations executives maintain that 
Hall is the victim of a "win-or-lose, all-or-nothing" scenario largely 
perpetuated by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Solomon, executive vice president and general sales manager for rival 
Twentieth Domestic Television, said, "Of course 'The Arsenio Hall Show' is not 
what it once was. But it still does well with its core viewership. Everyone is 
now splitting that younger audience that Arsenio once had all of." 
</P>
<P>
 "Arsenio is absolutely a thoroughbred and a winner," said David Brokaw, 
president of the Brokaw Co., a public-relations agency. "Despite what my 
colleagues may be saying, he is still a top booking when you have an album or a 
film to sell. When you look at what he's done and what's he accomplished, it's 
impossible to call him a failure. He's still got a solid audience." 
</P>
<P>
 His supporters note that Hall outlasted Chevy Chase's short-lived late-night 
venture on Fox this season, and Paramount officials said that in 10 markets 
where Hall's show goes head-to-head with "The Tonight Show," Hall is the winner 
with women 18-34. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a loyal young adult following that will follow him anywhere. And 
nothing matters but demographics," said KCOP's Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the public-relations official who was bemoaning the lack of "buzz" about 
Hall said he was only downgrading the show, not writing it off. "We've had 
plenty of clients on Arsenio, and we're not saying we're not going to put more 
of our clients on there," he explained. "But he's not going to be high on our 
list when we're putting together our media schedule."

AND THE EARTH DID NOT SWALLOW THIS FILM PROJECT; MOVIES: SEVERO PEREZ 
PERSEVERED TO MAKE THE FEATURE BASED ON THE 1971 NOVEL OF A CHICANO BOY GROWING 
UP IN A MIGRANT FARM-WORKER FAMILY IN THE '50S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Severo Perez, an independent Chicano filmmaker and writer, is about to see his 
dream of a lifetime come true. His feature film " . . . and the earth did not 
swallow him" is set to premiere Saturday at the Santa Barbara International 
Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is based on the 1971 semi-autobiographical novel ". . . y no se lo 
trago la tierra," by the late Tomas Rivera, the Chicano writer who was 
chancellor of the University of California at Riverside when he died in 1984. 
Rivera's much-praised book tells the story of a Chicano boy growing up in a 
migrant farm-worker family in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez recalled that after reading the book 20 years ago, he excitedly called 
Rivera on the phone. "I told him it was the first time I ever saw my culture, 
the stories, the people that I grew up with on a page, and they were real. I 
think he was a little embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmaker also tried to secure the rights to the film at the time. "Rivera 
said, 'Go ahead and just do it.' I told him I needed a release. Unfortunately, 
I couldn't take his word and get funding." Perez later learned the film rights 
had been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the San Antonio, Tex., native built Learning Garden, a 
successful educational film and animation company in Hollywood. He also worked 
as a producer on Jesus Trevino's "Seguin" and wrote "Soldier Boy," a screenplay 
about a Chicano family adjusting to life in post-WWII Texas. Although that film 
was never made, Perez and his wife, Judith, adapted it into a play, which 
premiered in 1982 at El Teatro Campesino, directed by Luis Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, I devoted my time to getting the rights to 'tierra,' " said 
Perez, now 52, in an interview at his Silver Lake home. He finally bought the 
rights to the book from the author's widow. 
</P>
<P>
 When Perez contacted PBS producer Paul Espinosa, he didn't think their project 
would turn into a major production, but to their delight, they received a 
$1-million grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to write and 
research the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the film finished shooting in 1992, Perez ran out of money to complete 
the film's score and post-production. Espinosa got additional money from the 
Corp. for Public Broadcasting and from "American Playhouse," the PBS-TV program 
that funded Greg Nava's "El Norte" and Ramon Menendez's "Stand and Deliver." 
Espinosa now sets the film's final cost at nearly $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perez admits they were lucky, since most independent Latino film projects in 
Hollywood usually fall by the wayside. "The problem with Chicano filmmakers," 
he says, "is that we don't have access to the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Perez feels that a healthy, independent Chicano cinema is 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a Chicano cinema, we have to address a Chicano audience, their 
sensibilities. We can't just expect an Anglo actor with brown contacts to speak 
to our culture. It has to be deeper than that. The chemistry for Mexican rice 
isn't just tomatoes and rice; it's a whole process of building something from 
scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started making films before I saw Chicano films," he says. "The one 
filmmaker I appreciated was Mexican director Alfonso Arau, especially his 
'Calzonzin Inspector' and 'El Aguila Descalza.' They were films made on the run 
and are still exciting to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez was also inspired by Italian Neo-realist director Vittorio DeSica's 
"Bicycle Thief." "When I was desperately looking for more money to finish 
'tierra,' I reminded myself that DeSica shot most of his film in wide shots 
because it was the most inexpensive way to work. Since I had 47 locations in 27 
days and a small budget, I told the story using master shots because in that 
wide shot you get a sense of atmosphere as well."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Hollywood bemoans the supposed lack of qualified Latino actors for 
starring roles, Perez had no such problem. He cast veteran Latino actors Rose 
Portillo ("Cagney & Lacey") and Marco Rodriguez ("Hill Street Blues") as the 
boy's parents; Daniel Valdez ("Zoot Suit") as Bartolo, a traveling troubadour; 
Lupe Ontiveros ("El Norte") as a deceiving baker's wife; and Sal Lopez ("Virgin 
of Tepeyac") as El Mojado. 
</P>
<P>
 Casting the lead role of the migrant boy was harder. He saw some 300 kids 
before picking Jose Alcala, 16, of East Los Angeles for the part. "Jose has 
honesty," Perez said of his choice. "He also has enormous courage. For a young 
actor with little acting training, he took risks by getting out there and doing 
the lines I gave him without hesitation. What you see on the screen is 
genuine." Alcala, a Garfield High School student, previously co-starred in the 
television movie "The Long Walk Home" with George C. Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed working with Mr. Perez," says Alcala. "He told me that 'tierra' was 
the story of a boy who's looking through his past to discover who he is. That 
helped me get a better grip on the role." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez is hoping his film will be picked up by a commercial distributor for a 
theatrical run after its premiere. "Although 'tierra' will air nationally on 
'American Playhouse' this fall, PBS is encouraging us to seek a commercial 
release to make the film more visible when it is aired in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The director's next project is a small-budget film version of "Soldier Boy." 
"It's an extension of 'tierra,' both in time and place," he said.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: MYSTERY TRAIN GOES ITS OWN WAY; ROOTSY BAND WELCOMES 
EXPOSURE IN JAPAN WHILE WAITING FOR ITS TIME IN GRUNGE-DOMINANT U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After 10 years of enforced patience and persistence, Michael Ubaldini is 
finally about to see tangible evidence that those virtues are sometimes 
rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1984, Ubaldini has been kicking around the Orange County rock scene, 
fronting various bands while developing a rootsy sound that takes its cues from 
such classy sources as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater 
Revival, Memphis soul and Memphis rockabilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, only one small piece of purchasable music has resulted from all 
that effort -- a vinyl single Ubaldini cut in the mid-'80s with his first band, 
the Earwigs. 
</P>
<P>
 But next month, the Fountain Valley resident's new band, Mystery Train, will 
emerge with its first album, "706 Union Avenue," named for the Memphis address 
of the famous Sun Studios that gave rise to Elvis Presley, Howlin' Wolf and 
Jerry Lee Lewis, among others. The group plays Friday at Club 5902 in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as he sat last week in a favorite cafe in his hometown, Ubaldini was 
well aware that his foreseeable future will require even more patience and 
persistence. Mystery Train's album is being released only in Japan, where the 
four-man band recently was signed by a major label, Toshiba/EMI. 
</P>
<P>
 In a U.S. market heavily tilted toward grunge-alternative bands dishing Angst 
and fury, an act such as Mystery Train, with its classic sources, clean sound 
and generally exuberant tone does not have the record industry clamoring to get 
on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Ubaldini, 27, maintains a cheerful outlook. He spoke with more amusement than 
scorn as he related his latest frustrating run-in with the domestic music 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 A scout from a major label recently showed interest in Mystery Train, "but 
they wanted us to completely change," said Ubaldini, who recently took to 
performing under the stage name Michael Anthony, substituting his middle name 
for a last name that he says people tend to flub.  
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted me to put on flannel," he said. "But I'm going to do what I'm 
going to do. Shoot, I'd rather look like Jesse James than Paul Bunyan." With 
his tousled pompadour, black leather vest, torn T-shirt, and jeans with a key 
chain jangling at the hip, the lanky 6-footer is cut from a rock 'n' roll 
outlaw mold that was set by the '50s rockabillies and updated by the Clash when 
the British punk band came on the scene in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way I've always been," Ubaldini said. "I liked the way Gene 
Vincent and those guys (from the rockabilly era) dressed, and the 
Hamburg-Beatles look. I used to get a lot of flak for the way I dressed. I'd go 
into clubs in Orange County and people would openly mock it. It would just add 
more fire for me to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 Ubaldini says he harbors no grudge against grunge for being dominant: "I'm 
glad these bands inspire groups to play in garages. And it means that now we're 
more the alternative. We're facing some of the same obstacles bands were facing 
in the beginning of the alternative scene. But walls were made to be climbed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery Train's leader has a good store of equipment for scaling barriers in 
the business. His singing voice is a reedy but grainy tenor that can 
simultaneously convey both a sense of fun and a shading of wistfulness. He is a 
strong lead guitarist in the straightforward, roots-conscious tradition of John 
Fogerty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ubaldini also writes songs prolifically: "If I ever dry up, I'd still have 
several albums ready to go," he said. "In the last year and a half, I've 
accumulated 75 good songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ubaldini's songwriting interests range from wry, colorful songs about the 
eager chase after gorgeous women, to depictions of Americana that he etches 
with visual details in an attempt to create a strong sense of place. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his best efforts are "Mardi Gras," a song that captures the good-time 
charms of Louisiana life, "Down Home Sweet Girl," an indelibly catchy 
appreciation of a lass so winsome she couldn't possibly exist, and "Civil War 
(Across the River)," a stormy Romeo-and-Juliet tale that strives for mythic 
dimension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to write images, where you can almost see the dirt or smell the grass 
of the areas I'm writing about," he said. "There's so much havoc and crime 
today. I don't want to be even more depressing. I'd rather remind people of the 
beautiful things about America. To me, a bridge over a muddy creek is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, when it came time for a photo session, Ubaldini already had his 
spot picked out: a stone wall that fronts a strawberry field in Westminster, a 
small patch of rural Americana in the middle of a typical Orange County crush 
of shopping strips and housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been able to write songs, maybe as an escape from Orange County," 
Ubaldini said. "You shut your mind off and boom -- I can be in Louisiana or any 
place I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Ubaldini caught the rock 'n' roll bug young, lured by his older sisters' 
collection of records by such '60s stars as the Beatles and the Animals. His 
father was a country-music fan who helped the young Ubaldini take his first 
steps on the guitar by teaching him Hank Williams songs. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother's contribution was to let him stay up past his bedtime one night 
when he was about 7, so that he could see Little Richard perform on a 
late-night TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just saw that energy. It seemed so exciting to me. It moved me, and I knew 
what I wanted to do," Ubaldini recalled. "In school, when I had to draw a 
picture, I'd draw a guy with a guitar." 
</P>
<P>
 Ubaldini's first band, the Earwigs, began to take shape during his senior year 
at Fountain Valley High School. Playing a mixture of punk and roots rock, the 
band released a single in its first year of existence. It won some airplay on 
KROQ and KNAC, but the band never followed it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't have any direction," Ubaldini said. "The music was there, and 
we had a pretty good following, but the band just fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Ubaldini and some friends tried moving to the roots-rock hotbed of Austin in 
the late '80s but made little progress and stayed only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were having too much fun. I decided, 'I'm going to end up an alcoholic 
here if I don't get back home.' It was a good experience, though. I really 
learned to play the blues in Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 The short-lived King Rockers was his next band. Ubaldini launched Mystery 
Train about two years ago. After the other original members left a year ago, 
Ubaldini established the band's current lineup, with bassist Tom Slik, drummer 
Rob Klonel and guitarist Steve Norton. 
</P>
<P>
 He also found a manager, Rich Modica, who had toured extensively as a guitar 
technician and production manager for several bands, including the Stray Cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Modica had Japanese music-industry contacts from his work with the Stray Cats 
and was able to put them to use on Mystery Train's behalf. Two members of the 
Stray Cats contributed to "706 Union Avenue" -- Lee Rocker produced the album, 
and Brian Setzer added a guitar solo to one song. 
</P>
<P>
 Modica and Ubaldini take pains to point out that, even with the Stray Cats 
connection, Mystery Train should not be pegged as a rockabilly band. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mystery Train could never be called a revival band of any sort," Ubaldini 
said. "It's taking everything from gospel to punk and using it to our 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Ubaldini spent two weeks in Japan last December doing radio and television 
appearances to lay the groundwork for the upcoming album release. A full-band 
tour is planned in May and June. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he waits for a break in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think that I should have put out more records," Ubaldini said, 
looking back on a 10-year discography of next to nothing. "At the same time, a 
lot of good bands break up because their records get thrown in the (bargain) 
bin or get no distribution at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sense doing a record that doesn't get in stores," Modica figures. 
"At least with this Toshiba/EMI deal, we know it will be in every record store 
in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 Ubaldini lives with his family these days, having given up the entry-level day 
jobs he worked over the years to concentrate on music full time. He says he has 
not exhausted the patience and perseverance that allowed him to go almost a 
decade without the tangible reward of an album release that most young rockers 
need to stay motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just that I love music and rock 'n' roll so much," he said of 
his endurance. "It's like it controls me. That's why I keep going. I couldn't 
visualize myself doing anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 * Mystery Train plays Friday at 11 p.m. at Club 5902, 5902 Warner Ave., 
Huntington Beach. Soul, Barrelhouse and Coyote Circus also appear, starting at

BRIDGING THE SMALL GAP BETWEEN 2 ROCK CULTURES; POP MUSIC: 'REVOLUCION '94' 
CONCERTS WILL SHOWCASE THE BOND BETWEEN MEXICAN BANDS AND U.S. ALTERNATIVE 
ROCKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 This weekend's "Revolucion '94" concerts are a groundbreaking attempt to 
bridge the gap between rock en espan ol -- rock with Spanish lyrics -- and U.S. 
alternative rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in L.A., I think it's very evident that we have to understand each 
other's cultures more," said concert organizer Marusa Reyes, the manager of the 
four Mexican bands on the concerts, which will be Friday at the Open Air 
Theatre in San Diego and Saturday at the Universal Amphitheatre. Both shows 
start at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this should have happened 30 years ago, not only with Mexican music, 
but with all the arts," added Reyes, who has also included an art exhibition at 
the Los Angeles show. "The arts in general will help us get along better." 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup for "Revolucion '94" features rock en espan ol bands Caifanes, 
Maldita Vecindad, Santa Sabinaand La Castaneda, as well as American alternative 
rockers Redd Kross and Live. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Adrian Belew, who will open the shows with an acoustic set, first 
became interested in Mexican rock in 1992 when he was approached to produce 
Caifanes' latest album, "El Silencio." While in Mexico City meeting with 
Caifanes, he saw Santa Sabina perform and decided he wanted to produce an album 
for them as well.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's an explosion of music going on there," said Belew, who has played 
with King Crimson and David Bowie, among others. "The music, despite the 
language barrier, had a touching effect on me."  
</P>
<P>
 While the Mexican bands have all been influenced by traditional Mexican music, 
they also share a style and an audience with American alternative bands.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing a blend of Mexican music and alternative rock, "Revolucion" headliners 
Caifanes are one of the most popular bands in Mexico, and helped open the doors 
for other Mexican rock bands. Santa Sabina plays edgy art-rock, and La 
Castaneda adds rock guitar to a complex, rhythmic sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The eclectic Maldita Vecindad mixes ska, funk and various forms of traditional 
Mexican music into a tight groove somewhat reminiscent of Fishbone's. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Mexico City, the band's members listened to everything from 
bolero and tango to the Sex Pistols and the Clash. Maldita Vecindad takes its 
Mexican influences and updates them, integrating them with rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pacho, the band's drummer, "We don't want the mariachis to be the only 
symbol of Mexican musical culture."

A CRITICAL LOOK AT WOMEN OF MTV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman University today will screen the video that MTV doesn't want you to 
see. "Dreamworlds," one of Chapman's Women's History Month presentations this 
month, excerpts 165 MTV music videos for a scathing indictment of the way they, 
and by association, the cable-TV channel, portray women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dreamworlds" producer Sut Jhally, who teaches at the University of 
Massachusetts at Amherst, says that his film "makes the argument that what we 
see in rock videos is the male-fantasy dream world."  
</P>
<P>
 MTV threatened -- but never followed through on -- a threat to block the 
exhibition of Jhally's 1990 video, which has since been distributed to some 
1,500 colleges and universities around the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be shown at 11 a.m. in Chapman's Argyros Forum, room 202, 333 N. 
Glassell St., Orange. Free. (714) 997-6961. ZAN DUBIN

OPERA PACIFIC SETS PLANS FOR 1994-95 SEASON; MUSIC: THE COMPANY SCHEDULES NEW 
PRODUCTIONS OF FOUR WARHORSES AND EYES 'CONTROVERSIAL' CASTS TO CREATE 
INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an express effort to maximize box office, Opera Pacific has picked four 
warhorses for its 1994-95 season -- Verdi's "Aida" and "La Traviata," Puccini's 
"Madama Butterfly" and Mozart's "The Magic Flute." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are clearly aiming at 90%-plus attendance," general director David 
DiChiera said Tuesday. "This season -- 'Die Walkure,' 'Faust' and 'Lucia' -- 
the percentage of house was not among our highest. It's going to be around 80% 
-- but that 10% difference between 80% and 90% is very critical in terms of our 
earned income." 
</P>
<P>
 DiChiera estimated the 1994-95 budget to be $5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Casting is my focus next year," DiChiera said. "It's with artists who are 
particularly interesting and controversial and intriguing, and will make 
singing even very well-known operas interesting and exciting. Tiziana 
Fabbricini, for instance, is going to create a great deal of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabbricini, one of two Violettas scheduled for "Traviata," generated huge 
controversy in the role when she sang it at La Scala, the Metropolitan Opera in 
New York, the Vienna Staatsoper and the Berlin Opera. Critics and audiences 
were divided over her intense acting and, some said, erratic vocal production. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera Pacific has presented all three of the Italian operas before, but the 
productions next season will be different. The "Aida" was created for San 
Francisco Opera in 1981 by Douglas Schmidt and Lawrence Casey. The production 
of "La Traviata" was created for the Lyric Opera of Chicago by Desmond Heeley; 
it will be seen for the first time on the West Coast. "Butterfly" will be a new 
production by Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Butterfly' continues to come at the top of our request list," DiChiera 
said. "It amazes me the public response that 'Butterfly' gets."

IMAGENS HONOR TV SHOWS, BUT NO MOVIES; AWARDS: GROUP FINDS NO POSITIVE LATINO 
PORTRAYALS IN MOTION PICTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two TV movies, two TV documentaries and one TV drama series were honored 
Wednesday with Imagen Awards for their positive depiction of Latinos. But the 
National Conference of Christians & Jews, which bestows the awards, found no 
motion pictures deserving of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth time in the nine-year history of the organization's Latino 
media image awards that no theatrical movie was honored. A spokesman termed the 
feature-film results disappointing and called on the film industry to step up 
efforts to hire Latinos and to create positive images that will help combat 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards, handed out at a Beverly Hills luncheon, covered the period between 
May, 1992, and February, 1994 (there were no award ceremonies last year). 
Selections were made by a panel of industry professionals and Latino community 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners were NBC's "For the Love of My Child: The Anissa Ayala Story," a 
TV movie about a Latino couple whose daughter is stricken with leukemia; CBS' 
"An American Story," a TV movie about World War II veterans finding that 
discrimination still exists in their Texas hometown; the PBS documentary "The 
Hunt for Pancho Villa"; the KCAL-TV Channel 9 documentary "The Emerging 
Majority: Mexican Americans in Los Angeles" and CBS' "Second Chances," a drama 
series that included a Latino family among its regular cast of characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Moreno, winner of Oscar, Emmy and Tony awards, was given an Imagen 
lifetime achievement award "for her nearly four decades of distinguished 
contributions to the industry and to positive media images for Latinos."

RAMONES MILESTONES; THE RAMONES JUST PLAYED THEIR 2,000TH GIG, BUT 'I'M NEVER 
CONSCIOUS OF MY AGE,' SAYS SINGER JOEY, NOW 41, 'BECAUSE I'M TIMELESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rock 'n' roll was settling into an adulthood of polished professionalism and 
seasoned expertise when the Ramones came along and started behaving like punks. 
</P>
<P>
 The band arrived in 1976 with "The Ramones," a burp gun of an album that fired 
away in loud, fast, catchy bursts ranging in duration from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 
minutes. The black and white cover showed the band members in front of a 
crumbling, graffiti-covered wall of brick and cement -- four shaggy-haired, 
leather-jacketed New Yorkers who looked like hoods and geeks, not polished 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 14 tracks inside, guitarist Johnny Ramone, drummer Tommy Ramone and 
bassist Dee Dee Ramone (everyone took the same adopted surname to underscore 
the band's stripped-down simplicity and singleness of purpose, not to mention 
its sense of the absurd) hammered out primitive slabs of sound and smashed them 
against the era's prevailing assumption that good music had to be carefully 
honed with mastery and skills that took years to cultivate. The unstated 
premise behind the Ramones was that rock should never be left in the hands of 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Ramone, the singer, was a spindly stack of elongated bones and alarmingly 
pallid skin. His chesty-nasal bleat of a voice proved an apt conduit for the 
band's deadpan humor. The Ramones' songs were catchy platforms for the voice of 
put-down, put-upon, bored, shiftless and inarticulate youth, which stood up and 
declared its intentions: 
</P>
<P>
 Now I wanna sniff some glue.  
</P>
<P>
 Now I wanna have somethin' to do.  
</P>
<P>
 or 
</P>
<P>
 Beat on the brat, beat on the brat,  
</P>
<P>
 Beat on the brat with a baseball bat,  
</P>
<P>
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Ramones" was a spark that lit the fuse of '70s punk rock. The band toured 
England in 1976, Johnny Rotten and many other disaffected young Brits came, 
saw, heard what you could achieve by being loud, raw and technically unskilled, 
and took it from there. 
</P>
<P>
 Go to a Ramones show today and you're apt to find that not much has changed. 
Marky drums in place of Tommy, and C.J., not Dee Dee, sounds the rapid 
"1-2-3-4" count-off that typically marks the end of one frenetic number and 
starts the next. But if time stands still for the Ramones, milestones are 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
 They are celebrating their 20th year as a band. Young alternative-rock bands 
cite their influence, and some even write songs about them. Frank Black, the 
opening act on a tour that brings the Ramones to UC Irvine on Saturday, 
recently paid tribute to these punk mentors from Queens with a soaring ode 
called "I Heard Ramona Sing." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking over the phone recently from his apartment in Manhattan's Greenwich 
Village, Joey Ramone said he doesn't dwell upon being an elder statesman of 
punk. "I'm never conscious of my age, because I'm timeless," said the singer, 
who is 41. "You've just gotta keep yourself healthy and in a positive, 
optimistic state." But he admitted that sometimes the passing milestones and 
the mounting tributes touch him unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just did our 2,000th performance on Feb. 9 in Tokyo. I usually just shrug 
it off, but it's a major achievement and I feel really good about it in a way I 
didn't think I'd feel. We're a unique band. We have definite values and ideals 
we've always maintained, and people respect that." 
</P>
<P>
 Huge sales have not followed from that respect: The Ramones have yet to score 
a Top 40 album or single in the United States, where they have always been a 
club- and theater-level attraction with a steady cult following (Ramone says 
they are a much bigger draw overseas). They recently released their 13th studio 
album, "Acid Eaters," an all-covers collection that pays tribute to their own 
influences from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The punk movement that the Ramones helped ignite, meanwhile, has turned into 
the lucrative business of alternative rock. As "alternative" music becomes the 
new arena-rock, it is not unusual to hear successful bands proclaim their punk 
roots, hoping to be seen as standing apart from a mainstream that, like it or 
not, now is carrying them along. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramone doesn't appear to be jealous of younger rockers reaping the rewards of 
shifting tastes. He spoke enthusiastically of the Ramones' recent slot on a 
Lollapalooza-type festival in Australia called the Big Day Out, which found 
them billed with such younger, hotter-selling bands as Soundgarden, the 
Breeders, Primus, Bjork and Smashing Pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the cool alternative bands," he said. "It felt real good. We were real 
friendly with everybody and it was a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't think there is much point in young bands striving to acquire 
punk-ness as a credential if the spirit isn't in them from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays it's very trendy to say, 'I want to be a punk band,' and it's very 
fashionable. To me, 'punk attitude' is a kind of (bogus) phrase. You have it or 
you don't. It's within you; it's natural. Most of the bands that (affect) that 
attitude are phony and it's a superficial thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "One person who really has it is P.J. Harvey. She just radiates intensity. 
That's being genuine. It's something you don't conjure up. It's within 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ramone, who grew up as Jeffrey Hyman in the wealthy New York City 
community of Forest Hills, rock's inner pull was strong early on. "When the 
Beatles came it changed my life, and I knew what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 He started playing drums at 13 and entered Forest Hill High, which was a rock 
'n' roll high school of sorts, numbering among its graduates Paul Simon and Art 
Garfunkel, and Leslie West, the guitarist with the hard-rock band Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the most pleasant memories of high school," Ramone said in a 
full-blown New York accent. "At the time it was rated one of the top 10 best 
schools in the country. I got suspended a couple of times because I was wearing 
sunglasses and long hair. They said I might hurt myself wearing sunglasses in 
the hallways." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramones began to take shape in 1974 when John (Johnny Ramone) Cummings and 
Douglas (Dee Dee Ramone) Colvin, guitar players from Forest Hills, recruited 
the young Hyman to play drums. "I didn't know John, but I knew of him from 
hearing about his antics, pranks like throwing TVs off rooftops and stuff like 
that," Joey recalled. "I'd met Dee Dee when I would go to see the New York 
Dolls at Kenny's Castaways (a Manhattan rock club). When they asked me to play 
drums I wasn't crazy about that idea (he had ambitions to be a singer), but I 
did it because I knew together we could do something great. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, Johnny wanted to be the fastest guitarist on Earth, which he has 
since accomplished," Ramone continued. "The speed just kept increasing, and 
after a while I couldn't handle the drumming anymore so they moved me up to 
being a singer." Tom (Tommy Ramone) Erdelyi was a more experienced musician who 
was advising the band at that point. "We were auditioning drummers, and in 
those days everybody was very flamboyant, and we wanted a simple drummer like 
Charlie Watts. (Erdelyi) had never played drums in his life" but agreed to take 
over the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramone brotherhood was Dee Dee's idea. According to Joey (who might have 
been Jeffy Ramone had not Dee Dee started calling him Joey instead), the 
bassist had heard that Paul McCartney used to check into hotels under the 
assumed surname Ramone. 
</P>
<P>
 The band got its start playing at CBGB, the Bowery club that spawned such 
contemporaries on the New York underground as Talking Heads, Television and 
Blondie. "We were labeled punk rock by the press," Ramone said. "We were 
totally alien to what everybody else was doing. We wanted to play music that 
excited us and was fun to play." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't claim that the band invented punk rock out of nothing. He readily 
cites the influence of bands that had emerged in the late '60s and early '70s 
emphasizing a rebellious attitude and a loud, ragged sound that prefigured 
punk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stood alone, but we were inspired by and were fans of the New York Dolls 
and the Stooges and the MC5. We were big music fans and we absorbed everything. 
But we were starting from scratch and making our own rules on how to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 One rule passed early on called for band members to report for gigs in alert, 
unimpaired condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first show, we got a couple of six-packs to soothe the nerves, and it was 
kind of (messed) up. We realized that with the kind of music we play, with the 
intensity we play, you had to be straight when you're playing it. If you want 
to do something else, do it on your own time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramones have been criticized for sticking to their original concept and 
failing to go beyond the hard, fast, wall-of-sound approach. But Joey insists 
that the band has been flexible, and points to the occasional ballads and 
openly romantic pop songs that dot the Ramones' discography (among them "Don't 
Come Close," a jangling, acoustic-based song from the 1978 album, "Road to 
Ruin"). 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, the band began to write more serious-minded anthems including 
"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg," a declaration of anguish and ire in 1986 over Ronald 
Reagan's controversial visit to a German military cemetery (the issue was 
whether Reagan should have paid tribute to the memory of an enemy's fallen 
troops, especially when some of them had been part of the SS, the corps that 
created so many innocent corpses in its role as chief operative in the 
Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities). 
</P>
<P>
 "To us, it was a kind of slap in the face to America, politically motivated 
(expletive)," Ramone said. "It was total disrespect, kind of a 
forgive-and-forget thing. Well, you don't forget the Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramones play their anthems in concert. But don't look for them to try any 
slow stuff, or to toy with new arrangements of old nuggets. "Should we do (an 
oldie) as a reggae song, a hip-hop song?" Joey asked rhetorically. "We know 
what's good. A lot of bands go on to butcher themselves and it's almost a goof. 
We know better. You don't tamper with perfection." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Acid Eaters" collection doesn't tamper radically with the '60s sources 
the Ramones honor, including songs by the Who ("Substitute"), the Animals 
("When I Was Young"), the Rolling Stones ("Out of Time"), Jefferson Airplane 
("Somebody to Love") and Bob Dylan ("My Back Pages," sung by C.J., who replaced 
Dee Dee in 1989). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a treat for ourselves," Ramone said of the all-covers concept. "Pete 
Townshend came down and sang backup vocals on 'Substitute,' which for me was 
one of my ultimate highs. He and Iggy Pop are my two last surviving heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramone says that fans who come to shows to slam-dance to the band's 
single-minded onslaught of the hard and the fast might be surprised at some of 
his own musical interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very broad-minded about what inspires me and influences me. I like Neil 
Young. I'm not really crazy about his loud stuff; I like the folk stuff. I love 
the song he wrote for the 'Philadelphia' soundtrack. It's one of the most 
beautiful songs I ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramone also has been getting into the music of Woody Guthrie over the past 
year or so, having struck up a friendship with the folk music pioneer's 
daughter, Nora. And he has done some extracurricular singing outside the 
Ramones in settings that are far from punk rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year he appeared on a tribute album honoring the avant-garde composer 
John Cage. He recently joined General Johnson, the trebly-voiced singer from 
the early-'70s soul band Chairmen of the Board, to record an R&B version of the 
Ramones' song "Rockaway Beach." Ramone also is moonlighting on a recording 
project with his younger brother, Mickey Leigh, who previously fronted a band 
called the Rattlers. 
</P>
<P>
 What he'd really like to do is a solo album, but he says that Johnny Ramone 
and the band's management have vetoed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I've wanted to do for a lot of years," he said. "My album 
would be totally non-conventional, like a smorgasbord." 
</P>
<P>
 The two remaining original Ramones never have gotten along smoothly, according 
to Joey. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was always a friction between me and John, like between Daltrey and 
Townshend. We don't really hang out; we're business partners. But when it comes 
to the band, we're on the same wavelength. We want what's best for the band." 
</P>
<P>
 With 2,001 performances behind the Ramones as they embark on their U.S. tour 
(the show at UC Irvine will be number 2,006), Joey thinks the band has a chance 
to make it to 2,500 -- or about 5 more years at its going rate. He doubts the 
Ramones will be around for a 3,000th gig. 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 years, it would be only natural if he found himself struggling to 
deliver the excitement promised in the trademark cry that led off the Ramones 
debut album: "Hey, ho, let's go!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I feel that way before the show," he said. "But when I'm up there I 
never feel that way. We have the best fans in the world, die-hard loyalists. 
It's not like you're playing a show; it's like this hysteria out there. It's 
always that way, and that's all you need."

COMEDY: MR. EX; ANTHONY GRIFFITH USED TO JUST BE SILLY, BUT HE'S A DRAMATICALLY 
DIFFERENT PERFORMER NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From his childhood days of impressing friends with his skill and gusto for 
extricating himself from a straitjacket, Anthony Griffith has matured. 
Significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Also dropped from his quiver of tricks these days are his Diana Ross and 
Michael Jackson imitations, as well as the Houdini-like way he could usually 
free himself underwater wrapped in chains and handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very different at an early age," Griffith, who headlines at the Irvine 
Improv through Sunday, said from his home in North Hollywood. "I wanted to be 
an escape artist. I'd go to the neighborhood Y, and people would tie me up and 
I'd jump into the pool. My mom even bought me a straitjacket. I lost a few 
friends. They'd say, 'I can't play with you because my mom says you're crazy,' 
or else they'd wear garlic around their neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, or fortunately, the straitjacket fell victim to an early 
romantic venture after he had taken it to show-and-tell at school in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked a girl I really liked to the bus stop, and she was going to give me 
a kiss, and I put the straitjacket down. I was on cloud nine, but I left my 
straitjacket." 
</P>
<P>
 That left him without one of his better props, but he still had his voice to 
entertain his parents, younger brother and the friends he had left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always put on little concerts at the house," Griffith, 30, recalled. "One 
week I'd be Michael Jackson, then I'd be Diana Ross, and my family would be the 
Supremes. My mother never stopped me from dreaming. She'd say do whatever you 
want to do, just don't break any laws. That helped me. There was no pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken, articulate Griffith grew up on the West, South and North 
sides of Chicago, the first two areas especially rough communities that housed 
pockets of gangs and crime. Several of Griffith's school chums died before they 
could graduate. But at the time, the comic wasn't fully aware of how bad his 
neighborhoods were. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all right," said Griffith, who left Chicago for the West Coast when he 
was 27. "There were some guys who were real mean, but a lot of guys didn't pick 
on me. I guess they thought I was silly. I'd make 'em laugh. I was also skinny. 
Maybe they thought it wasn't worth it to beat me up. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends watched over me. After basketball, I'd say, 'I'm going home,' and 
they'd say, 'We're going to rob a store. Want anything?' You don't really know 
how bad an area you live in until you move out and see it from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 In a twist for comics, Griffith was not the class clown. He took his education 
seriously (ending up with a bachelor's in speech and communications from 
Northeastern University in Chicago). 
</P>
<P>
 But when recess rolled around, Griffith turned into Elvis and James Brown, 
with all the moves, for the girls in the class. Even the school bully was 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted me to dance for him privately. I told him I couldn't dance without 
the proper music. He said he was going to beat me up if I didn't dance right 
away. I think I danced until dark." 
</P>
<P>
 But what Griffith lived for in grade school were the field trips to see plays 
such as "Jack and the Beanstalk" and "Peter Pan" or to see magicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Only, at the public schools money was tight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd go on bus trips without the bus. It seemed like everywhere we went, we 
just walked. I never understood that. We were just told to hold hands and 
walk." 
</P>
<P>
 From that early introduction to theater, Griffith matured into playing Malcolm 
X in "The Meeting," a fictional account of an encounter between Martin Luther 
King and Malcolm X. The run recently ended at the Stage of Grace in Hollywood, 
and Griffith's reviews were good. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really helped me branch out and helped other people see me as an actor," 
Griffith said. "It was a lot of fun. I learned (the two men) were a lot alike 
in a lot of ways. They just had different ways of going about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Meeting" isn't his only success. For his role in the earlier Theatre 40 
production of "Home," he won a Drama-Logue award in January for best male actor 
in a one-act play. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith's comedy career took root at Northeastern while he was studying 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got into comedy as something I wanted to do. But I didn't think it 
would last this long." 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1984. He worked clubs in and around Chicago before winning the Johnny 
Walker Comedy Search in 1989 and heading west, where he landed regular 
appearances on "The Tonight Show" and "Arsenio." 
</P>
<P>
 He'll also be seen as a guest performer in the upcoming "The Bob Hope Young 
Comedians Special," which Griffith says will air later this month. Rounding out 
his resume are roles on network shows such as "Who's the Boss?" and "Good 
Sports." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you always have that dream when you get into entertainment, getting 
on 'The Tonight Show' . . . And you know the talent coordinator isn't going to 
come to Chicago," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, the performer is the picture of cool, blending a subtle energy with 
veteran polish and great lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really read the paper to get jokes, so I start off from personal 
experiences," said Griffith, who usually includes a few lines about his wife, 
Brigette. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to find out a lot in about 45 or 50 minutes about Anthony 
Griffith." 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Anthony Griffith.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: PAT MCLAUGHLIN: "UNGLUED", DOS RECORDS  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rest of the music world might be going unplugged, but I don't expect to 
hear a finer album this year than McLaughlin's "Unglued." He's a Nashville 
songwriter who has been covered by, among others, Trisha Yearwood, John Prine 
and Steve Wariner, none of which prepares one for this cozily stunning album.  
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin has the pith of John Hiatt, the whimsy of Prine, the soul of Al 
Green (OK, not quite ) and a whole bunch of something all his own. Whatever it 
is, after a couple of listens, nearly every song on "Unglued" is able to call 
up moods and emotions in a way usually only a few of one's favorite old records 
can. Some of it is true roadhouse rock, some is reminiscent of breezy 
pre-Beatles pop, some borders on Van Morrison's mystic soul, while in other 
places he sounds like a country David Lindley. The songs are at once inviting 
and familiar while haunting and beguilingly out of bounds. I've been listening 
to this album nonstop for a couple of weeks and have to admit that in many 
cases I don't know what the hell McLaughlin is singing about, but it's still 
reaching me. 
</P>
<P>
 Some songs, like the infectiously grooving "Better You Get Ready" and "Night 
Thing" -- a rollicking Hiatt-meets-NRBQ burner -- don't exactly cry out for 
extrapolation. Others, though, such as "Wind It on Up" and "Nothin' but 
Trouble," have such a powerful feeling of longing and melancholy that one 
expects the lyrics to directly support that. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 On the latter song, he begins: 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling girl, even with your hands can make,  
</P>
<P>
 Such a night ring true, baby,  
</P>
<P>
 Only flower underneath my rug can find,  
</P>
<P>
 Such a piece of cake,  
</P>
<P>
 'Cause I've got nothing but trouble,  
</P>
<P>
 Since you lay down beside me.  
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the playful poetry of the lyrics is sufficiently beguiling, as when 
on "Friendly Bird" he sings, "I didn't know people could still move this slow, 
Where did all of them Mohicans go?" Curiously, these songs are no less moving 
than his more evidently "serious" lyrics, such as on the nakedly romantic "Try 
the Love" and the redemptive "Long Time." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the words, McLaughlin's voice seems to imbue them with a new gravity. 
His soulful but slightly cartoonish voice often lingers on words, as if they're 
furniture being dragged across a wood floor. Meanwhile, the musical settings 
are never less than enthralling, produced by Ben Keith, best known as Neil 
Young's pedal steel guitarist. JIM WASHBURN

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: ERIC CLAPTON: "MONEY AND CIGARETTES" (1983), WARNER BROS . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Money and Cigarettes" probably isn't the best album for those looking for an 
introduction to Eric Clapton's formidable body of work. It doesn't include any 
of the English singer/guitarist's better-known songs, nor does it feature the 
type of scorching instrumental work that earned him the ironic nickname 
"Slowhand" back in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those who already have tasted and digested Clapton's more acclaimed 
albums, "Money and Cigarettes" comes across as a marvelously appealing album by 
an artist playing mostly -- if not entirely -- for the love of it. This is 
certainly one of Clapton's least commercial, most understated efforts (indeed, 
it sold rather dismally when it first was released). There is a certain 
looseness and soulful passion permeating the tracks that can be traced to the 
impressive lineup of roots-oriented musicians recruited for the project. It's 
hard to argue with a band that includes ace slide guitarist Ry Cooder, former 
Stax studio bassist Donald (Duck) Dunn and ex-Muscle Shoals percussionist Roger 
Hawkins, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening, laid-back blues of "Everybody Oughta Make a Change," Clapton 
and company settle into a rhythm and groove that seems as natural and 
spontaneous as some of the earliest, earthiest rock records. There is no 
evidence of battling egos here; the band members play with unselfish grace and 
assurance as they enliven a number of blues covers and Clapton originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights: the restrained but cutting rocker "The Shape You're In" 
and a little-known Johnny Otis song, "Crazy Country Hop," a Clapton favorite 
from his teen years. JON MATSUMOTO

KID STUFF: ETHICS AND POWER; MIGHTY MORPHINS ARE THE BIG DRAWING CARD, BUT 
THERE ARE OTHER CHOICES AT THIS EXPO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When youngsters at last year's Kids Stuff Expo tired of in-line skating, 
"moonbouncing" or the dozens of other 20th-Century pursuits there, they could 
probe the distant past at a faux paleontological dig. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, they'll be digging again, but they won't turn up a single dinosaur 
bone. Instead, visitors to the expo's Character and Ethics Pavilion will be 
asked to rummage through their own thoughts and values in a walk-through maze 
presented by the Character Counts Coalition, a national, non-sectarian agency 
that promotes character-building programs among youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The maze will feature stations at which toddlers through adults can select the 
appropriate action in six situations. Depending on their answers, visitors will 
be led either to a dead-end or further through the maze, ultimately emerging, 
organizers hope, with a better understanding of ethical decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 The pavilion is one of many themed areas at the expo, which showcases 150 
exhibitors of youth-oriented products and services as well as multiple hands-on 
activities for kids. Billed by promoters Joel Jacobs and Jody Schlonsky as 
Orange County's most comprehensive source of "edu-tainment," the event runs 
Saturday and Sunday at the Anaheim Convention Center. Featured elements include 
a large, hands-on computer pavilion sponsored by Microsoft, a play zone where 
kids can try out a variety of name-brand toys, roller hockey workshops led by 
the Anaheim Bullfrogs and ongoing POG tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah. The Power Rangers will be there, too. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday and Sunday, two of Saban Entertainment's Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers will suit up in their best super-hero Spandex to press the flesh with 
fans and pose for photographs. According to a Saban spokeswoman, the Anaheim 
gig is one of the few public appearances by the Rangers prior to a national 
theatrical tour planned for this summer. Last month, a performance by all six 
Rangers at Universal Studios drew 35,000 kids and parents and created traffic 
snarls that even Power Ranger nemesis Rita Repulsawould be proud to call her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger mania, in case you've managed to avoid it, stems from a half-hour live 
action show that airs locally on Fox television. The show centers on the 
exploits of six teen-agers, who, through their combined efforts, change or 
"morph" into super-heroes whenever truth, justice or the God-given right to 
wear bright, stretchy stuff is challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some adults claim the show inspires violent behavior among children, 
Saban's Debra McCormick maintains that the Rangers are "pure fantasy, very over 
the top" and provide "positive role models for kids (in the areas of) teamwork, 
self-discipline and self-esteem." Fans range in age from 2 to around 11, said 
McCormick, adding that the boy-to-girl ratio in that group is about 60-40 
because "two of the Rangers are girls, and they're just as powerful as the 
boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Rangers won't be doing any special performances at the expo, 
organizers still expect an enormous turnout. To balance the crowds, each event 
ticket will have an additional stub specifying which of the Ranger sessions the 
ticket-holder may attend, and overflow parking areas will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Jozelle Smith, a spokeswoman for the Character Counts Coalition, admits that 
she's unsure what kind of response her quiet little maze will garner at the 
expo, an event that, even without the Power Rangers, isn't exactly a center of 
calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know (our activity) doesn't have a glitzy appeal," Smith acknowledged. 
"But if we can get some of our information into the hands of parents and 
teachers, we'll be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, an offshoot of the Josephson Institute of Ethics in Marina del 
Rey, lists among its board members actor Tom Selleck, former U.S. Education 
Secretary William G. Bennett and former Rep. Barbara Jordan (D-Tex.). Member 
organizations include the American Federation of Teachers, the United Way and 
the YMCA.  
</P>
<P>
 The group's programs include a new "gang response project" that will be put in 
place at three Central California alternative schools in September, and which 
Smith says she hopes will become a model for similar programs nationwide, as 
well as workshops to help teachers and youth leaders teach ethical 
decision-making to young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the expo, visitors can choose from hands-on activities in a 
museum zone that includes the La Habra Children's Museum, the Launch Pad 
science center and Oak Canyon Nature Center; check into the CHOC Teddy Bear 
Clinic; bowl a fast game in a regulation-sized bowling lane or shoosh 152 feet 
across the convention center on board the North American Wilderness Zip Line. 
Sporty types can roll with the Bullfrogs, take part in gymnastics workshops or 
rub elbows with U.S. National Soccer team members (the latter on Sunday only, 
from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.).

MUSIC / DANCE: SOPRANO SWENSON LOVES THE DEMANDS OF 'LUCIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Orange County Edition.

<P>
 You could give one Donizetti opera every week for more than a year without 
having to make any repeats. In fact, you would need 65 weeks to exhaust the 
list this way. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most popular works is his 50th, "Lucia di Lammermoor," which Opera 
Pacific is presenting at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa 
through March 19. The libretto is based on a wildly successful historical novel 
by Sir Walter Scott titled "The Bride of Lammermoor," which he wrote in 1819 
(the same year that he wrote "Ivanhoe"). In it, a woman goes crazy when her 
brother forces her, for political and financial reasons, to marry a man she 
doesn't love and thus betray the man she does love. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen stage adaptations and one opera version of "The Bride of 
Lammermoor" preceded Donizetti's effort, which premiered in 1935 in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some sources, Donizetti wrote the work in 36 days, with one of 
the most brilliant coloratura sopranos of the day, Fanny Persiani, in mind for 
the lead role of Lucia. According to others, he simply revised an earlier work, 
and Persiani was not the intended soprano. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, his original intention apparently was to accompany the Mad Scene 
with a glass harmonica instead of a flute, as happens now. The flute cadenzas 
were not even written into the original score; the composer left them to the 
flutist to improvise. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, Persiani did sing the premiere, and she created a sensation, 
which virtually every major coloratura soprano since has tried to repeat, 
especially when tackling Lucia's coloratura Mad Scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lucia is a very demanding role," said Ruth Ann Swenson, who sings it for 
Opera Pacific. "It's hard, but I love singing all the cadenzas and the roulades 
and the coloratura passages in the bel canto repertoire. It's all great for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Swenson sang the role in Washington, Detroit, Dallas and in the Metropolitan 
Opera summer parks concerts. She will sing the role next fall in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Swenson, born in Bronxville, in Westchester County, N.Y., grew up on Long 
Island. Both her parents were high school teachers who occasionally sang in 
oratorios. She described them as "professionals, but not on a grand scale." She 
had two younger brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a musical family," she said. "I was surrounded by music growing up, 
but it was nothing we were pushed into. We liked it, but I can remember sitting 
in the car one day when my mom had the Saturday matinee broadcast from the Met 
on, saying, 'Do we have to listen to this? I don't like it.' Now look at me. 
I'm on the broadcast." 
</P>
<P>
 Swenson studied at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia and afterward 
went into the Merola Opera Program at the San Francisco Opera. She met her 
husband, David Burnakus, who sings in the San Francisco Opera chorus, on one of 
the Western Opera Theater tours.  
</P>
<P>
 The two were married in 1986 and maintain a home in Napa. "I see it about six 
weeks out of the year," Swenson said. "This is not a glamorous life, like 
people think. It's not all fun and games. It's hard. You live out of suitcases, 
staying in hotel rooms. It's lonely. You have to learn to cope with all the 
traveling." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband is only able to travel "at times, when he's not working," she 
said. "But he'll be coming down for this."  
</P>
<P>
 What: Opera Pacific presents Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, March 11, and March 17 and 19 at 8 p.m.; Sunday, March 13, at 2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: San Diego (405) Freeway to Bristol Avenue exit north, then go 
right on Town Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $15 to $75 (student and senior rush: $15 for unsold seats one 
hour prior to curtain). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 556-2787. 
</P>
<P>

NIGHT SHIFT: COUNTY RACKS UP NEW BILLIARD HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Pool sharks have another jewel to treasure in the county's crown of upscale 
halls with the addition of Diamond Billiards in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 As elegant as its chief competitors, Metropolis and the Shark Club, Diamond 
also enlists industrial decorator touches such as exposed pipes and air ducts 
overhead. However, while its peers offer the game in a plush, neo-Renaissance 
setting with dark woods, velvet seating and reproductions of classic Western 
European art, this month-old club takes a lighter, more modernist approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The hand-textured marbleized walls in golden caramel are as sublime as the 
leopard-print carpeting covering most of the 6,500-square-foot floor. The 
original art is minimalist and contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while Metropolis and Shark Club offer room to dance, Diamond Billiards 
focuses the action exclusively at the tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-moon bar top and its surrounding flooring are of black granite, but 
the area is warmed by the golden wood that makes up the classic bar. There, a 
black T-shirt clad crew serves 10 beers on tap, including Samuel Adams, Pete's 
Wicked Lager and a microbrew called Oregon Honey, from $3 for domestic to $3.50 
for imports. There are 15 bottled beers to choose from at $3 to $4. Also on the 
list are wells, $3.50; glasses of wine, $3.50 to $4.50; and soft drinks, $1.50. 
A happy hour from 3 to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday, offers domestics for $2 
and imports for $2.50. The menu features appetizers, quick dinners and 
desserts, most under $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke-eaters throughout the place do away with the cigarette exhaust from this 
mostly twentysomething crowd. The dress code is casually fashionable, but a 
dress shirt untucked -- even when worn with a suit -- will get you a request 
from the beefy doorman to, well, tuck it in. 
</P>
<P>
 An unobtrusive and amiable staff caters to patrons' needs, from racking the 
balls to lighting a cigarette. After every game, an employee freshens up the 
tables, positioning the sticks, wiping down the chrome and collecting the 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
 So what about the tables? Try 14 Gold Crown IIIs with the ultimate surfaces, 
similar to those seen in the American Open. These babies cost $7,000 a pop and 
are worth every penny. They may prove slippery for the novice, but any decent 
player should definitely check them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates are $6 an hour until 6 p.m. daily, rising in the evening to $12 per hour 
Sunday through Thursday and $15 on Friday and Saturday. A table near the bar 
regularly offers challenge tournaments after 9 p.m. until closing on the 
weekends, where patrons can play for $2 until they lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Each table features its own cushy booth only steps away and a cable-equipped 
TV hanging from above. There are two semiprivate areas with seating for up to 
25 people, available by reservation or on a first-come basis. Charity 
tournaments at the recently opened hall have been planned, and leagues have 
started, with time allotted Monday through Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the mystique, an elevator ride is required to get up to Diamond 
Billiards, which is on the second floor in this designed-for-yuppies shopping 
center (complete with a gym and full-service salon). Look for the club's 
entrance around the corner from Caffe Classico coffeehouse. 
</P>

KIDS ON FILM: 'REALITY': MAYBE IT REALLY DOES BITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Reality Bites," a university valedictorian (Winona Ryder) struggles to 
replace her baby boomer parents' materialistic values as she goes to work at a 
TV station, vacillates between her desires for a TV executive (Ben Stiller) and 
a laconic musician (Ethan Hawke), and chronicles her roommates' counterculture 
lives on video. (Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 So this is it? This is what kids can look forward to after years of schooling? 
A world of roommates, getting high, playing television trivia games, one-night 
stands, AIDS panic, and using toilet paper for coffee filters?  
</P>
<P>
 The movie offers a somewhat comic look at a very grim reality -- transitioning 
into the work world of the 1990s. It's a place where idealism and cynicism 
emerge as flip sides of the same coin. 
</P>
<P>
 Their parents and all their friends' parents are divorced, immature or leading 
lives devoid of passion and urgency. The job market stinks. They'd rather just 
play guitar. Or date someone who plays guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though kids are recommending this film to their friends, many were not 
quite prepared for the bleakness.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was different from most movies you see," said Erin Getzelman, 14. "It was 
so different, I can't describe it.  
</P>
<P>
 Erin said she was looking forward to growing up until she saw this movie. "It 
made everything seem like a tragedy. You were really high or really down." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the kids already knew it is all too true. Jennifer Bammer, 13, said: 
"One of my friends has an older brother and she said it was kind of like what 
happened to him. Getting fired all the time. She said he's having a lot of 
troubles finding a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of depressing, but it was, like, true. I liked it, but it's not 
one of those movies where you come out and feel good about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend, 12-year-old Katie Rittenhouse, agreed. "You feel that's exactly 
what's going to happen to you and you don't want to face that."  
</P>
<P>
 Neither girl aspires to work at Burger King. Katie wants to be an architect 
and Jennifer, a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe things will be better by then," I offered lamely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," sighed Katie. "Maybe. Maybe not. It seems like there's nothing 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Killackey, 12, said he wasn't depressed because he simply didn't believe 
college graduates would have such a hard time finding work. "The part where the 
guy said, 'You're overqualified for a job,' I just don't think that would 
happen. It was bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sorry, Kevin. Most of us already know at least one Ph.D. on food stamps 
who is trying to land a McJob. It is bizarre.  
</P>
<P>
 Their friends had raved about the movie despite its grimness. Explained Erin: 
"Everybody tells you to go see the movie because of Ethan Hawke. . . . They 
were right." 
</P>
<P>
 The new teen idol: He's brilliant. He's poor. He has problems with intimacy. 
He tricks his female roommates into doing his laundry by hiding his boxer 
shorts among their dirty clothes. He could be a parent's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 But the kids also found some laughs in the movie: when Ben Stiller and Winona 
Ryder have trouble kissing and hanging onto their Big Gulps at the same time; 
when Ryder zones out by braiding her bangs and singing to herself; when the 
roommates, high on pot, start dancing in a food mart.  
</P>
<P>
 Some kids were bothered by the continual substance use depicted on screen.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's great for kids to see that," Jennifer said. "They were 
always smoking. That got kind of old." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Katie: "To celebrate, they got high. That was kind of stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Katie also found the love story too unconventional to follow well. In this 
movie, boy has already met girl. Girl meets another boy. Original boy gets 
girl. "It was weird," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, I had only one question: After boy gets girl, how will they live?

SPECIAL SCREENING: A UNIFORM SECURITY IN 'LAST LAUGH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The doorman, the unnamed hero-victim of F.W. Murnau's "The Last Laugh," loves 
his uniform. It's a big, bulky symbol of power, and he feels renewed every time 
he wraps himself in it. 
</P>
<P>
 His neighbors respond with exaggerated respect. Whenever the doorman leaves 
the hotel where he works and strides home, they check him out, admiring the 
image. They like the strength his uniform projects; they feel more secure 
because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reverence is close to surreal, and it says something about a culture 
that craves authority. Whether intentional or not, Murnau's classic silent film 
predicts a Germany that would later give way to Hitler and his khaki-clad Nazi 
mob. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1924 movie, screening Friday as part of UC Irvine's "Tragedy and Comedy" 
series, was made by the same man who created "Nosferatu," a German 
Expressionism landmark that made the most of Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Like the 
1922 horror flick, arguably the eeriest of the vampire movies, "The Last Laugh" 
is visually striking. 
</P>
<P>
 Murnau refused to use subtitles -- he wanted famed cinematographer Karl 
Freund's camera and the actors, especially Emil Jannings in the lead role, to 
tell the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Murnau, whose reputation rests primarily with those two films and "Sunrise" 
from 1927, was a director who was in tune with the silents. Coming out of the 
Expressionist movement (he started as an avant-garde stage director), Murnau 
emphasized the medium's stark image potential, discovering that his moving 
pictures could have the same impact as, say, a painting by Edvard Munch. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact in "The Last Laugh," which was written by Carl Mayer, one of 
Germany's most lauded screenwriters, comes from Murnau's direction and Freund's 
inventive lens, but the story is full of meaning, like a warped fable. The tale 
of Jannings' doorman is mundane but universal in its vanity and tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 His fall comes when the hotel manager realizes the old man can't handle heavy 
luggage any longer and is demoted to a restroom assistant. His uniform is taken 
away, but he steals it so he can wear it home, deceiving his neighbors and 
ensuring their respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Once discovered, the former doorman is ridiculed and begins a rapid descent. 
Humiliation leads to depression, which leads to booze. There's more than a 
little melodrama in these scenes, but irony as well. The happy ending, which 
has been debated by film historians for years, is a wry coda that sardonically 
comments on the sentimentality that audiences of the day preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides bringing Murnau, Freund and Mayer together, the picture is significant 
because of Jannings, considered the leading German actor of his era. Jannings, 
best known for starring opposite Marlene Dietrich in "The Blue Angel," was as 
suited to the silents as Murnau; his dramatic gestures made the most of the 
period's broadly suggestive quality. 
</P>
<P>
 A last note: The scheduling of "The Last Laugh" at UCI is timely, for Murnau 
died in a car accident the same day in 1931. He was 42. 
</P>
<P>
 What: F.W. Murnau's "The Last Laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, March 11, at 7 and 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The UC Irvine Student Center's Crystal Cove Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to Jamboree Road and head south 
to Campus Drive and take a left. Turn right on Bridge Road and take it into the 
campus. 
</P>

RESTAURANTS: 'BROILER TIPS THE SCALES TOWARD FISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Broil on, Columbia, broil on. To our mesquite-hungry nation comes Market 
Broiler, a fast-growing chain specializing in broiled seafoods, clam chowder 
and, for die-hard red-meat eaters, a few steaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach branch opened about six months ago on a sleepy stretch of 
Brookhurst next to a Target store. How sleepy is this neighborhood? Frankly, 
until Market Broiler opened, I never saw a single soul around here who wasn't 
just driving through. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise into the parking lot at any respectable hour today, though, and you 
might see a crowd of people actually walking around. Chances are most of them 
will be milling under the Market Broiler's red and black awning, or just inside 
the front door, waiting impatiently for seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that we are crazy about fish dinners when they go for under $10, 
as just about all the dinners here do. (Only two or three catches of the day -- 
Atlantic salmon at $13.95, for instance -- sail beyond the $10 limit.) That 
must be why, in four visits, I've only gotten in right away one time, and that 
was late on a Monday evening. On other nights I have waited up to 45 minutes 
for a table here, along with a crowd of families, seniors, young people, 
weight-watchers and just plain thrifty diners. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance you might be tempted to think of it as a fancied-up Red 
Lobster with a snazzy oyster and cocktail bar, but that doesn't do this concept 
justice. Market Broiler is more like a fish market that serves food. The 
cashier stand next to the door is stocked with saltwater taffy, sourdough bread 
and prettily packaged seasonings and chowder mixes that the chain manufactures: 
Bavarian mustard, Cajun seasoning, sweet and sour barbecue sauce, etc. Just 
beyond that is a bona fide fish counter, where you can buy fresh seafood such 
as Dungeness crab, sand dabs and nicely fileted sea bass for taking home to 
cook up for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 But why would you want to? Here, for a nominal extra cost, you can get a chef 
to do the work and a waitress to serve you hot sourdough bread, side dishes 
such as cheese potatoes or cole slaw and an entire line of silly drinks made 
with crushed Oreo cookies or pureed strawberries. Such a deal. And you don't 
even have to do the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual dining areas are pure Americana. The larger of them features a live 
fish aquarium, plastic marlin and a wooden ship's wheel. The entire restaurant 
is strewn with ersatz Tiffany lamps, flower print curtains and photos on 
nautical themes. The best tables are cushy red vinyl booths, even if they do 
fit a bit snugly. The worst ones are the deuces stuck smack in the middle of 
the floor, where the waitress and bus boy foot traffic is more like a foot 
traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
 The appetizer list is pretty humdrum: chicken fingers, fried calamari, sauteed 
mushrooms, Buffalo wings and suchlike bar snacks. The calamari is the best of 
them, the chewy squid chunks lightly fried in fresh oil with a reasonably 
crunchy batter. The worst is probably the Buffalo wings. These shiny orange 
drumettes taste as if they've been dipped in salted Tabasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dinners come with properly crusty sourdough, a salad and a choice of side 
dishes that includes good steamed red potatoes and a tangy, finely chopped cole 
slaw. (I wouldn't brag much about the artificial-tasting cheese potatoes, 
though, or the insipid rice pilaf or the underripe cherry tomatoes that 
wouldn't splatter if you dropped them off a 10-story building.) For 95 cents 
you can substitute a workmanlike cup of pasty white or salty red clam chowder 
for your salad. I wouldn't, mostly because I rather like the fat, herbed 
croutons on the generic but fresh tossed salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish are never displayed two days in a row here, and the restaurant guarantees 
that what you order will be fresh. I've had sand dabs, flaky orange roughy and 
firm-fleshed Atlantic salmon with the skin still on, all of them fine, though 
the taste of mesquite didn't particularly come through on any. The menu gives 
you a choice of having your fish prepared Cajun style (peppery and salty) or 
with fresh-Mex salsa (good), Jamaican lime pepper (fair), lemon pepper, honey 
Dijon sauce or teriyaki glaze, the last being a thick, ginger-flavored goo that 
tastes more Caribbean than Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is also filled with endless possibilities for "designing your own 
combo," meaning you can have any two items from a group for $9.95 and any three 
for $11.95. This is a bargain when you consider that the choices include 
mahi-mahi, salmon, halibut, snow crab legs and other popular favorites. If you 
want pasta, there is a short list of spaghetti, fettuccine Alfredo and a few 
others. I only tasted spaghetti, and it was most definitely not al dente, with 
a reasonable tomato sauce and a scorched garlic aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
 More upscale items (king crab, lobster and steak) are also available, some by 
daily price quote. For red meat eaters, I recommend the one-pound porterhouse, 
which is a decent steak and a good value at $14.95. The best bargain for 
shellfish would be the lobster, shrimp and scallop combination at $13.95. For 
this price, you get three skewers of tender, flavorful chunks of broiled 
seafood brushed lightly with what tastes like a lemon garlic butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts -- the standard array of guilty pleasures -- include a gooey toffee 
fudge brownie, creamy Snickers cheesecake, German chocolate cake with a huge, 
other-worldly leaf of white chocolate sticking out of the top and thickly 
frosted carrot cake. They all come to your table with a refrigerator chill upon 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 When you leave, one of the managers will approach you and warmly ask you how 
everything was, smiling as if he knows the answer already. Well, why shouldn't 
he smile? There are plenty more where you came from, most of them probably 
right outside the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Market Broiler is moderately priced. Fish are $6.95 to $13.95. Chicken and 
beef are $7.95 to $14.95. Pastas are $6.95 to $13.95.

PARKER'S PLACE: PUTTING A VALUE ON LIVES -- OURS AND THEIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, a false spring issued across the county at a time when, 
traditionally, rain is pouring. For us humans, this meant summer clothing, sun 
on our skin and the usual increased activity out of doors. The beaches and bike 
trails were hopping, the tennis courts busy. Interested looks and smiles passed 
between people of similar age and opposite gender, hormones simmering in the 
warmth. Premature as it was, this little faux came as a welcome reminder that 
winter -- mild as it has been thus far -- will soon be coming to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 My domestic animals sensed the change, too. The big dogs took to lumbering 
after rabbits, barking with recharged enthusiasm at the UPS man, a patient 
fellow named Michael who does his best to ignore their bluff. Eddie, the indoor 
dog, developed a new talent that my brother identified as "method begging," in 
which the dog recalls the traumas of his puppyhood in order to bring more 
pathos to his begging expression. Everybody had a new angle. 
</P>
<P>
 The wild animals of our region also enjoyed the weather. At night, the coyotes 
of Laguna Canyon sang with a volume and energy unheard in recent months. 
Mockingbirds, sparrows and bushtits cavorted loudly, even though it will be 
several weeks before they get down to the actual business of mating and making 
nests. Mosquitoes hatched out -- big ones droning through the twilight sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The fence lizards came out in force, both the adults with years of life behind 
them and last fall's hatchlings, which are now almost doubled in size. Lizards 
are the only animals I know that can find sun faster than a tourist. They 
napped on fence rails, shot across asphalt to nab the newly active ants, 
dangled, darted and delighted in the woodpile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mandevilla vine by my porch, a small web about the size of a playing 
card supported several hundred tiny hatchling spiders I could barely see, let 
alone identify. At first, I thought they were seeds. When I blew on the web, 
the seeds grew almost invisible legs to scurry up and down the silk to safety, 
though only moving about an inch. Then their legs folded back and they looked 
like seeds again. Within a day, the black ants had found the web and were 
gingerly negotiating its glossy byways, carrying away meals by the mandibleful. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted by this resurgence of the living, the observer couldn't help but 
feel an uplifting of spirit. For the better part of the first day, I went about 
my business capaciously reassured that life is good, life is sacred, life is 
holy. I wanted to gather all these things into my arms, carry them inside, seat 
them around my table and put on the feed bag for them. I wanted to listen to 
the smallest problems of the field mouse, to counsel, if I could, the two 
hummingbirds who had been dueling ferociously over access rights to the 
lavender blossoms. I wanted everybody to love everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Noonish, my brother Matt lifted a sheet of plywood from the woodpile, to 
uncover a 40-inch red rattlesnake curled up beneath it. After locking the dogs 
safely away, we flipped over the wood and beheld the serpent. She (only a 
guess) was coiled up in almost perfect symmetry, roughly the diameter of a 
dinner plate. She didn't move. Her eyes were open, because snakes don't have 
eyelids to close. Matt and I gazed down at the thing and wondered what to do 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine rattles," I noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty capable looking," said Matt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could make a belt out of it, but it seems like a waste of life." 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't taste very good either. Sort of like a really old catfish." 
</P>
<P>
 "All those ribs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably been here all winter. Just made it up to the top for the sun. It's 
too sluggish to even rattle." 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry more about the dogs than about us. They're dumb enough to walk right 
into this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 We used a snake hook to raise and lower the reptile into an empty trash can. 
She barely uncoiled during the airlift. She hit the plastic bottom with a thud, 
then offered a desultory rattle of about two seconds. Her rattles sounded 
waterlogged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," said Matt, "first we had a rattlesnake in the woodpile. Now we've got 
a rattlesnake in a trash can." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to think about this one." 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing like the discovery of something dangerous in your village -- a 
rattler, a rogue lion or leopard, a cobra, a scorpion -- to make one think a 
little harder about life and what it is worth, and what it is not worth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear to me that killing the snake for self-defense wasn't an 
altogether truthful concept because rattlesnake bites are, for humans, at 
least, rarely fatal. However, leaving it in the woodpile to revitalize in the 
coming spring seemed both foolhardy and irresponsible to my dogs and visitors 
(some with children) who come up here almost weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent the early afternoon contemplating the ethics of humankind as we 
interact with the other species on this planet, wondering if we, as a race, 
have been egregious in assuming without much thought -- until recent times -- 
that nature's bounty is simply there for us to utilize, displace or liquidate 
as we see fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly most of us agree that it is both ethical and necessary for human 
beings to eat some plants and some animals in order to sustain our lives 
(animal rights activists would disagree, claiming that a living animal should 
not be killed and eaten, but a living plant should be). So, ruling out the 
rattlesnake as food, what is my ethical obligation to her, as a genuine threat 
to the health and welfare of myself and the people, dogs, cats, horses, etc., 
around me? 
</P>
<P>
 Even under minimal scrutiny, the "life is sacred" argument doesn't cut much 
ice in our day-to-day world. Few of us balk at swatting a mosquito taking a 
blood meal from our flesh, or mourn the termites we exterminate. Only a fool 
would protest eradicating cancerous cells or the AIDS virus -- both of which 
are very much alive. We have accorded some lives a lower standing than others, 
cancelable on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, we find ourselves in the position of judging -- almost strictly on the 
basis of self-interest -- what life should be taken for protection or for food, 
what life qualifies to be left alone, preserved, even worshiped. It is 
difficult to put a value on life, but we, as humans, if we think about it, are 
asked to do it every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, there was a workable compromise with regard to the rattlesnake, in a 
way there might not be with a man-eating tiger or a rogue grizzly bear. We 
simply dumped the sleepy reptile into a six-pack cooler, took her to the other 
side of the mountain and let her go on a hillside where, we hope, she will 
bother no human and no human will bother her. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the snake will eat her meals of mammals and lizards and defend 
herself against predators, with none of the foregoing introspection. She has a 
cleaner sight line than we do. Watching her slide beneath the prickly pear, I 
was thankful that there is room in this county -- at least for now -- for both 
of us to eke out a living.

3-HOUR TOUR: A TINY POCKET OF PLACENTIA IS FULL OF TREASURES AND PLEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiny Bradford Park in Placentia, and the area around it, yield a 
turn-of-the-century house, classes in decorating items for your own home and a 
place where you can sell them if you do. 11 to noon: Albert Sumner Bradford was 
born in Maine in 1860, ran away from home at 13, and en route to California 
learned the art of plant propagation; he later made his fortune packing 
oranges. In 1902, he moved his first home slightly to one side to make space 
for the 15-room Queen Anne-style residence now known as Bradford House, hauling 
by wagon and washing river rocks from Santiago Canyon to make the foundation. 
Eight orange trees on the property are original. His family gave the house and 
2 1/2 acres to the city in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradford outlived two wives -- sisters, incidentally -- and was outlived by a 
third not otherwise related; he had four children. He also raised hay of 
another sort, but about 100 years ago, children playing with matches set fire 
to his barn, burning both it and the crop. In 1977, children started another 
fire, which burned part of the home's roof. Three months later, children 
started yet another fire that destroyed the roof and damaged the second story. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-graders who tour the house today are fascinated with the basement and 
with the sliding "pocket doors" that disappear into the walls and were designed 
for privacy when boys came a-calling on the Bradford girls. Adults admire 
cabinets that open on one side to the kitchen, on the other to the dining room, 
so that clean dishes can be conveniently stored and the table easily set. Above 
the fireplace is a cabinet where dishes could be warmed before serving. A 
dumbwaiter carried items from floor to floor, such as laundry to the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the upstairs hallway is a settee, or what you might call a convertible love 
seat: The armrests lie down, all but inviting lovers to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few pieces that actually belonged to the Bradfords are a parlor sofa 
and chair; a fringed floor lamp; an assortment of linens and jewelry in a 
display cabinet; the bathtub; "The Magic Way" furnace, and a "partners desk," 
designed so a person can sit on either side. Numerous butt burns on the desk 
suggest that one of the partners was a smoker. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen boasts sugar and flour bins and a wooden icebox. 
</P>
<P>
 Casually lying about is a Los Angeles Times Cookbook, price 35 cents, based on 
a "1905 series of prize recipe contests" and offering "1,000 toothsome cooking 
and other recipes, including 79 old-time California, Spanish and Mexican dishes 
(and) recipes of famous pioneer Spanish settlers."  
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1: It's hard to tell which is the front door and which is the back at 
Sophia's Greek Cuisine; what you find in between will take you a world away. 
Lunch items ($4.25 to $4.95), all served in pita bread, include the obligatory 
gyro, falafel and souvlaki (marinated and grilled shish kebabs), and a rib-eye 
steak. For those so inclined, Greek wines by the glass ($2.75) include retsina, 
roditis and mavrodavne . 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner items are available all day, and appetizer selections can easily add up 
to a far more interesting meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Saganaki ($5.95) is goat cheese dramatically lit at table-side; the ouzo 
flames high, and lemon is squeezed with a flourish. Octopodi ($6.95) is a 
generous portion of steamed octopus sliced and served in a vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, rizogalo ($1.95) is a light, sensuously lumpy rice pudding topped 
with apricot confit or chopped pistachios. 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1:30: Tole painting, according to Debbie Thyr, owner of the Prairie 
Sampler, is "a way of making something plain something beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Using patterns (not stencils), graphite paper to transfer designs onto 
objects, and diverse stroke-work, Thyr teaches aspiring tole painters to make 
projects of which they might never dream themselves capable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging on the walls of the shop were projects that seemed anything but 
simple. A buzz saw, for instance, offered a farm scene requiring six different 
painting techniques. Fireplace and "privacy" screens seemed almost mural-like, 
and a portable linen closet the work of a very skilled artisan. Call for a 
schedule of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 A monthlong series for beginners, including supplies and wood pieces, runs 
$140, but watching is free and almost as much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 to 2: "Graduates" of the Prairie Sampler might end up at Crafters' 
Cottage. Jewelry, shirts, kachina figures, candy wreaths and monkeys made from 
socks are but a few of the items sold in booths that are rented out on a 
monthly basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Crafters set their own prices and decorate their own booths. A playroom at the 
rear accommodates crafters' and customers' kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The only restriction is that merchandise be handcrafted and made in the U.S.A. 
"Nothing manufactured, nothing overseas," said Wendy Rawley, one of the owners, 
who characterized the store's style as "country cutesy" and prices as "up to 
50% (off) retail." My 6-year-old and I are sharing a "sock monkey" that, for 
$15, proved irresistible. 1. Bradford House

 Joan of Arc -- A recent review in Ventura County Life of the musical "Joan of 
Arc" stated that "little remains of the original libretto by Susan Stewart 
Potter." Upon re-examination, this statement requires amplification. According 
to director John Blondell and composer David Potter, revisions were made to the 
libretto, but both stated that this is part of the normal development process 
and that Susan Stewart Potter collaborated in that process at every stage and 
deserves full credit as author of the libretto in its current form.

OCEAN VIEW SEES STAR IN HUGHEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a sophomore, Miles Hughey couldn't hack it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't ready physically," Ocean View Coach Steve Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started off good and had a game-winning hit in my first game," Hughey said. 
"But I played shaky defense and I got sent down to the JVs." 
</P>
<P>
 But after spending the rest of the 1992 season with the junior varsity and 
then working all summer to improve, Hughey won the starting shortstop job last 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 And he started producing. He hit .410 with 29 runs batted in last season, 
helping the Seahawks reach the Southern Section Division I quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Hughey has drawn the attention of professional baseball scouts.  
</P>
<P>
 Barrett said there are plenty of reasons the scouts like Hughey. 
</P>
<P>
 They like the senior's 6-foot, broad-shouldered, 185-pound frame and the speed 
that comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's unbelievable from home to first," Barrett said. "He can flat out run." 
</P>
<P>
 And he can hit. Hughey batted .410 with 29 RBIs last season. "He has a little 
bit of power, too," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 And his defense has improved dramatically since his sophomore season. "Miles 
has good hands and feet, a strong arm, and he's a smart player who plays real 
hard. He has some intangibles," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the best players in the county right now. Shortstops like Miles, 
with a little pop in their bat, are always in high demand." 
</P>
<P>
 But last season, Hughey was just another bat in the Seahawks' potent lineup 
that featured five players who hit .400 or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rivera hit .518, scored 30 runs, drove in 22 runs and stole 32 bases in 
the regular season. Mike Bellovich hit .468 and drove in 37 runs; Justin 
Brunette hit .440 with 24 RBIs, and Jeff Buchanan hit .414 in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Hughey is the lone returner and he might be a marked man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I try too hard and swing at the pitcher's pitch," Hughey said. "I 
put pressure on myself to produce for the team, but I know there are other 
sticks in the lineup. I'll take that free base any day." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett hopes he can find someone to produce behind Hughey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still looking for a guy to protect Miles so they won't pitch around 
him," Barrett said. "The guys hitting behind Miles will have to keep the 
pitchers honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughey hopes his Seahawks will be able to knock off preseason favorites 
Fountain Valley, Edison, and Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 And he knows the early-season rankings -- Marina is listed 11th in the nation 
by USA Today, Edison sixth in the county, and Fountain Valley ninth in the 
county -- don't amount to much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were No. 1 after we won the Loara tournament last season," Hughey said. 
"Then we finished third in league.  
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be intimidated when we play them," he said. "We'll be competitive, 
and they'll have to come and beat us." 1993 / IN REVIEW

<P>
 Pitcher Brian Ponchak, now with USC, won league co-MVP honors after leading 
Fountain Valley to the league championship. The Barons advanced to the second 
round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs, but were eliminated by 
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame, 6-5. . . . Pitcher Todd Belitz of Edison, who shared 
league MVP honors with Ponchak, helped the Chargers reach the second round of 
the playoffs, where they lost to eventual Division I champion Esperanza, 2-0. . 
. . Ocean View, the third-place team, defeated Glendale Hoover, 9-7, in the 
second round. But the Seahawks lost in the quarterfinals to Encino Crespi, 4-2.

<P>
 The biggest addition to Westminster's lineup is Montgomery, a junior transfer 
from Fountain Valley. Montgomery had 29 runs batted during the regular season 
to help the Barons win the league championship. Montgomery will hit third in 
the lineup, pitch and play third base. He had five hits in Westminster's first 
two games, a 7-6 loss to Long Beach Jordan and a 7-2 victory over Bolsa Grande. 
Matlock returns to play shortstop after hitting .325 in a half-season last 
year. He missed the second half last season after a pitched ball broke his his 
hand. Valles led off last season and hit .365. Rodriguez returns at catcher and 
will alternate hitting fourth or fifth with Glasby, who had 24 RBIs for the 
junior varsity team, which finished 17-6 last season. But Batesole will depend 
on defense to keep the Lions close. Said Batesole: "If everybody stays healthy 
and Sorensen, Montgomery, Torres and Berumen give us solid pitching, we could 
make a run at a playoff berth."

 Brian Ponchak, the co-MVP of the league last season, is now at USC. But his 
younger brother, Chris, picked up where he left off by hitting a grand slam and 
recording a save in the Barons' 5-4 victory over Marina in the quarterfinals of 
the Loara tournament Tuesday. Chris Ponchak, Keller, Hudson, Perkins, and 
Liuzzi are the five pitchers competing for positions in the starting rotation. 
Hoppie and Roman, both second-team all-league selections last season, should 
play prominent roles on offense. LaRuffa hopes Yanagisawa will also drive in 
runs and said Burford is one of the best young hitters in the county. "We have 
some young kids who would have played more last year but we had such a dominant 
senior class," LaRuffa said. "We should be near the top of our league, but it 
will be tough. There are no breathers in this league."

 Hard-throwing right handers Jon Ward (Cal State Fullerton) and Ryan Brannan 
(Miami) have led the Oilers in the past two seasons, and now it's Dillard's 
turn. Dillard doesn't fit the profile physically--he pitches left-handed and is 
6-foot-2, 175 pounds--but Dodd hopes Dillard can lead the staff. "He's not a 
strikeout pitcher, but we don't want him to try to strike everybody out," Dodd 
said. "We want him to get the ball to guys who will make the plays for us." One 
of those players is shortstop Daedelow, a three-year starter and first-team 
all-league selection. Center fielder Yadrick, who played running back for the 
football team, is also a key defensive player. "I'm a little nervous about this 
season," Dodd said. "We have a good little ball club, but the league is so 
strong. But we always know that in a 14-game league season, the most talented 
team may not always win it."

 Tereschuk takes over after spending the past seven seasons as coach at 
Whittier California, where he won one league championship. Tereschuk, the 
younger brother of Laguna Hills Coach Pete Tereschuk, played for the University 
of San Diego, then worked as an assistant at Long Beach Wilson. "We'll be solid 
on defense," Tereschuk said. "We have a good pitching staff and some decent 
speed." Miedecke has established himself as the staff ace, pitching a 
four-hitter with 11 strikeouts in the Friars' 4-2 victory over Anaheim Tuesday. 
Krotz, who had a home run in the victory, and Rossi give Servite stability up 
the middle. Tereschuk hopes Greene, Shaia and Berlanga can contribute 
offensively. "I'm not interested in what happened last year," Tereschuk said. 
"I just want us to improve."

 Gildea and Hughey are two reasons Barrett says the Seahawks can crack into the 
top three in the league. Gildea finished the regular season with an 8-1 record 
and a 1.44 earned-run average, then won two playoff games to help the Seahawks 
advance to the quarterfinals. Hughey batted fifth last season and is regarded 
as one of the best shortstops in the county. "I think we'll be the best 
defensive team in the league," Barrett said. Churchill (.360) and Foreman 
(.320) return to provide good gloves on the infield. Delachica, who started 
eight games in the outfield as a freshman, and sophomore pitcher Carr are two 
young players Barrett hopes will contribute immediately. "Cory Carr's going to 
win a lot of games for us," Barrett said. That is, if the Seahawks can generate 
enough offense. Ocean View averaged five hits in its first three games.

 Although the Vikings were ranked 11th in the nation is USA Today's preseason 
poll, they were unranked in the Orange County poll. Fountain Valley, ranked 
ninth in Orange County, beat Marina, 5-4, in the quarterfinals of the Loara 
tournament Tuesday. Renfrow said he hopes Sailor and Sipkovich will step up as 
seniors to lead Marina in the tough Sunset League. "If the pitching stays 
healthy, it could be a good year," Renfrow said. The rest of the team isn't bad 
either, with eight starters returning.

 The Chargers return four starters from last season's Sunset runner-up team, 
including two of the league's best pitchers. Belitz, the team's best 
power-hitter, is a hard-throwing lefty who shared league MVP honors with 
Fountain Valley pitcher Brian Ponchak. Surdock, a second-team all-league 
selection last season, also plays shortstop. "There's not a better 1-2 
combination than Belitz and Surdock," Huntington Beach Coach Mike Dodd said. 
And Barilla, another lefty, gives the Chargers added depth. Said Harrell: "Of 
our 21 victories last year, we have pitchers coming back that had 16 of those." 
Hanoian returns at the top of the lineup after earning first-team all-league 
honors as a sophomore. Robert Caton, a first-team all-league third baseman, 
graduated but Keyser will try to replace him. "We have the potential for a good 
year," Harrell said. Sunset coaches agree, pegging Fountain Valley, Edison and 
Marina as the favorites.

KIDS ON FILM: 'REALITY': MAYBE IT REALLY DOES BITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Reality Bites," a university valedictorian (Winona Ryder) struggles to 
replace her baby boomer parents' materialistic values as she goes to work at a 
TV station, vacillates between her desires for a TV executive (Ben Stiller) and 
a laconic musician (Ethan Hawke), and chronicles her roommates' counterculture 
lives on video. (Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 So this is it? This is what kids can look forward to after years of schooling? 
A world of roommates, getting high, playing television trivia games, one-night 
stands, AIDS panic, and using toilet paper for coffee filters?  
</P>
<P>
 The movie offers a somewhat comic look at a very grim reality -- transitioning 
into the work world of the 1990s. It's a place where idealism and cynicism 
emerge as flip sides of the same coin. 
</P>
<P>
 Their parents and all their friends' parents are divorced, immature or leading 
lives devoid of passion and urgency. The job market stinks. They'd rather just 
play guitar. Or date someone who plays guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though kids are recommending this film to their friends, many were not 
quite prepared for the bleakness.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was different from most movies you see," said Erin Getzelman, 14. "It was 
so different, I can't describe it.  
</P>
<P>
 Erin said she was looking forward to growing up until she saw this movie. "It 
made everything seem like a tragedy. You were really high or really down." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the kids already knew it is all too true. Jennifer Bammer, 13, said: 
"One of my friends has an older brother and she said it was kind of like what 
happened to him. Getting fired all the time. She said he's having a lot of 
troubles finding a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of depressing, but it was, like, true. I liked it, but it's not 
one of those movies where you come out and feel good about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend, 12-year-old Katie Rittenhouse, agreed. "You feel that's exactly 
what's going to happen to you and you don't want to face that."  
</P>
<P>
 Neither girl aspires to work at Burger King. Katie wants to be an architect 
and Jennifer, a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe things will be better by then," I offered lamely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," sighed Katie. "Maybe. Maybe not. It seems like there's nothing 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Killackey, 12, said he wasn't depressed because he simply didn't believe 
college graduates would have such a hard time finding work. "The part where the 
guy said, 'You're overqualified for a job,' I just don't think that would 
happen. It was bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sorry, Kevin. Most of us already know at least one Ph.D. on food stamps 
who is trying to land a McJob. It is bizarre.  
</P>
<P>
 Their friends had raved about the movie despite its grimness. Explained Erin: 
"Everybody tells you to go see the movie because of Ethan Hawke. . . . They 
were right." 
</P>
<P>
 The new teen idol: He's brilliant. He's poor. He has problems with intimacy. 
He tricks his female roommates into doing his laundry by hiding his boxer 
shorts among their dirty clothes. He could be a parent's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 But the kids also found some laughs in the movie: when Ben Stiller and Winona 
Ryder have trouble kissing and hanging onto their Big Gulps at the same time; 
when Ryder zones out by braiding her bangs and singing to herself; when the 
roommates, high on pot, start dancing in a food mart.  
</P>
<P>
 Some kids were bothered by the continual substance use depicted on screen.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's great for kids to see that," Jennifer said. "They were 
always smoking. That got kind of old." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Katie: "To celebrate, they got high. That was kind of stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Katie also found the love story too unconventional to follow well. In this 
movie, boy has already met girl. Girl meets another boy. Original boy gets 
girl. "It was weird," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, I had only one question: After boy gets girl, how will they live?

PARKER'S PLACE: PUTTING A VALUE ON LIVES -- OURS AND THEIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, a false spring issued across the county at a time when, 
traditionally, rain is pouring. For us humans, this meant summer clothing, sun 
on our skin and the usual increased activity out of doors. The beaches and bike 
trails were hopping, the tennis courts busy. Interested looks and smiles passed 
between people of similar age and opposite gender, hormones simmering in the 
warmth. Premature as it was, this little faux came as a welcome reminder that 
winter -- mild as it has been thus far -- will soon be coming to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 My domestic animals sensed the change, too. The big dogs took to lumbering 
after rabbits, barking with recharged enthusiasm at the UPS man, a patient 
fellow named Michael who does his best to ignore their bluff. Eddie, the indoor 
dog, developed a new talent that my brother identified as "method begging," in 
which the dog recalls the traumas of his puppyhood in order to bring more 
pathos to his begging expression. Everybody had a new angle. 
</P>
<P>
 The wild animals of our region also enjoyed the weather. At night, the coyotes 
of Laguna Canyon sang with a volume and energy unheard in recent months. 
Mockingbirds, sparrows and bushtits cavorted loudly, even though it will be 
several weeks before they get down to the actual business of mating and making 
nests. Mosquitoes hatched out -- big ones droning through the twilight sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The fence lizards came out in force, both the adults with years of life behind 
them and last fall's hatchlings, which are now almost doubled in size. Lizards 
are the only animals I know that can find sun faster than a tourist. They 
napped on fence rails, shot across asphalt to nab the newly active ants, 
dangled, darted and delighted in the woodpile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mandevilla vine by my porch, a small web about the size of a playing 
card supported several hundred tiny hatchling spiders I could barely see, let 
alone identify. At first, I thought they were seeds. When I blew on the web, 
the seeds grew almost invisible legs to scurry up and down the silk to safety, 
though only moving about an inch. Then their legs folded back and they looked 
like seeds again. Within a day, the black ants had found the web and were 
gingerly negotiating its glossy byways, carrying away meals by the mandibleful. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted by this resurgence of the living, the observer couldn't help but 
feel an uplifting of spirit. For the better part of the first day, I went about 
my business capaciously reassured that life is good, life is sacred, life is 
holy. I wanted to gather all these things into my arms, carry them inside, seat 
them around my table and put on the feed bag for them. I wanted to listen to 
the smallest problems of the field mouse, to counsel, if I could, the two 
hummingbirds who had been dueling ferociously over access rights to the 
lavender blossoms. I wanted everybody to love everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Noonish, my brother Matt lifted a sheet of plywood from the woodpile, to 
uncover a 40-inch red rattlesnake curled up beneath it. After locking the dogs 
safely away, we flipped over the wood and beheld the serpent. She (only a 
guess) was coiled up in almost perfect symmetry, roughly the diameter of a 
dinner plate. She didn't move. Her eyes were open, because snakes don't have 
eyelids to close. Matt and I gazed down at the thing and wondered what to do 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine rattles," I noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty capable looking," said Matt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could make a belt out of it, but it seems like a waste of life." 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't taste very good either. Sort of like a really old catfish." 
</P>
<P>
 "All those ribs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably been here all winter. Just made it up to the top for the sun. It's 
too sluggish to even rattle." 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry more about the dogs than about us. They're dumb enough to walk right 
into this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 We used a snake hook to raise and lower the reptile into an empty trash can. 
She barely uncoiled during the airlift. She hit the plastic bottom with a thud, 
then offered a desultory rattle of about two seconds. Her rattles sounded 
waterlogged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," said Matt, "first we had a rattlesnake in the woodpile. Now we've got 
a rattlesnake in a trash can." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to think about this one." 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing like the discovery of something dangerous in your village -- a 
rattler, a rogue lion or leopard, a cobra, a scorpion -- to make one think a 
little harder about life and what it is worth, and what it is not worth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear to me that killing the snake for self-defense wasn't an 
altogether truthful concept because rattlesnake bites are, for humans, at 
least, rarely fatal. However, leaving it in the woodpile to revitalize in the 
coming spring seemed both foolhardy and irresponsible to my dogs and visitors 
(some with children) who come up here almost weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent the early afternoon contemplating the ethics of humankind as we 
interact with the other species on this planet, wondering if we, as a race, 
have been egregious in assuming without much thought -- until recent times -- 
that nature's bounty is simply there for us to utilize, displace or liquidate 
as we see fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly most of us agree that it is both ethical and necessary for human 
beings to eat some plants and some animals in order to sustain our lives 
(animal rights activists would disagree, claiming that a living animal should 
not be killed and eaten, but a living plant should be). So, ruling out the 
rattlesnake as food, what is my ethical obligation to her, as a genuine threat 
to the health and welfare of myself and the people, dogs, cats, horses, etc., 
around me? 
</P>
<P>
 Even under minimal scrutiny, the "life is sacred" argument doesn't cut much 
ice in our day-to-day world. Few of us balk at swatting a mosquito taking a 
blood meal from our flesh, or mourn the termites we exterminate. Only a fool 
would protest eradicating cancerous cells or the AIDS virus -- both of which 
are very much alive. We have accorded some lives a lower standing than others, 
cancelable on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, we find ourselves in the position of judging -- almost strictly on the 
basis of self-interest -- what life should be taken for protection or for food, 
what life qualifies to be left alone, preserved, even worshiped. It is 
difficult to put a value on life, but we, as humans, if we think about it, are 
asked to do it every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, there was a workable compromise with regard to the rattlesnake, in a 
way there might not be with a man-eating tiger or a rogue grizzly bear. We 
simply dumped the sleepy reptile into a six-pack cooler, took her to the other 
side of the mountain and let her go on a hillside where, we hope, she will 
bother no human and no human will bother her. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the snake will eat her meals of mammals and lizards and defend 
herself against predators, with none of the foregoing introspection. She has a 
cleaner sight line than we do. Watching her slide beneath the prickly pear, I 
was thankful that there is room in this county -- at least for now -- for both 
of us to eke out a living.

 O ne paradox of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake was that, even as it toppled 
freeways and splintered buildings, it brought us together. Adversity forged 
bonds between a doctor and his patient, a shelter volunteer and a new mother, 
and an animal activist and a puppy.  
</P>
<P>
 Around Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center, they're calling it The Incredible 
Conception. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother-to-be is calling herself just plain lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 As Santa Monica rocked to the aftershocks the day of the quake, she was supine 
in her doctor's office under orders not to budge. A fertilized embryo had just 
been transferred to her uterus -- a delicate procedure normally done in a plush 
hospital room to soft background music. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 31-year-old patient -- a Guadalajara stationery store owner married to 
a gynecologist -- had been preparing six months for this. She wasn't going to 
let an earthquake stop her. Neither was Dr. Richard P. Marrs, the hospital's 
pioneering reproductive endocrinologist. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer could possibly have been postponed one day, Marrs says, but who 
knew what the next day might bring? Beyond 24 hours, the embryos -- which 
couldn't be frozen because the freezing equipment was damaged -- would not have 
been viable. Besides, and this was crucial, the patient's uterus had been 
hormonally prepared to receive the embryo on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that morning, Marrs slipped by security guards blocking entry to the 
hospital and fell in behind firefighters who were climbing the stairs. On the 
fourth floor, he found his in vitro fertilization lab in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the steel incubators were standing, their heating units still working. 
Inside one, were seven donor embryos fertilized by the patient's husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The dishes had bounced around, but in his microscope Marrs saw that five 
embryos -- each the size of a pinpoint -- looked good. 
</P>
<P>
 He tidied the lab, loaded the embryos into a catheter and called his office. 
The woman should go there, he instructed. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who asked for anonymity, remembers being told that the doctor was 
in the lab, "looking for the embryos." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before noon, Marrs wrapped the catheter in a towel and made a 
broken-field dash -- reminiscent of his days as a Texas Longhorn -- down the 
flooded hospital corridors, down the stairs, across 16th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got movin'," he says with a hint of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he ran up two flights to where the woman and her husband waited. "Their 
eyes were like saucers. They were terrified . . . but I don't think anything 
would have stopped them." 
</P>
<P>
 She had undergone premature menopause and an embryo transfer was her only hope 
of giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
 A 5-point aftershock hit as patient, husband and doctor waited two hours to 
give the embryo time to line up with her uterine wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, pregnancy was confirmed. "I was flabbergasted," Marrs says. 
"The stress she was under . . . she wasn't in the best of conditions to 
conceive." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has achieved 1,000 IVF births, the miracle on 16th Street is one of 
his great moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Even under ideal circumstances, when the embryos are in an uncontrolled 
environment for only seconds -- the catheter having been wheeled in an 
incubator to the patient's bedside -- the pregnancy rate is 30-40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Marrs points heavenward: "Somebody was really wanting them to be pregnant." 
</P>

 This is the story of when Sarah met Sarah.  
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Martinez was two days old when her parents, Norma and Juan, brought her 
right from the hospital to a Red Cross earthquake shelter at Santa Clarita 
Valley Boys and Girls Club on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Snyder was a Red Cross volunteer, who had heard that a newborn was 
coming and had made a makeshift bassinet and gathered extra blankets and 
diapers. Later, she'd buy rubbing alcohol and show Norma how to swab the baby's 
umbilical cord. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma recalls: "Sarah had two beds set up for me and my husband and a small 
one for Little Sarah, all decorated, all pink." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, 23, who has a 2-year-old son, says, "I remember going through 
childbirth and how it was for me. I wanted to make sure she had everything, 
like at home, and the baby was safe and secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder held, fed and changed the baby "so Norma could get some rest." That 
wasn't easy, surrounded by several hundred people. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it coincidence that the Martinezes came upon this good Samaritan with 
their daughter's name? 
</P>
<P>
 Norma, 24, and Juan, 28, a church maintenance worker, are devout Christians. 
She says, "I found the name Sarah in the Bible. We liked the name." 
</P>
<P>
 So the baby's name had been chosen before Big Sarah came into their lives. 
When they met her, Norma knew it was "a blessing from God." 
</P>
<P>
 Little Sarah, now a 12-pounder with a shock of black hair, got quite a start 
in life. For three days before she was born, her parents, displaced from their 
apartment, slept in a tent in a park. During Norma's labor, aftershocks rocked 
the hospital in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is back home and Big Sarah has come to baby-sit and to bring gifts 
from well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, Norma hopes, Sarita will want to be baptized when she's older. Maybe 
Big Sarah will be the godmother. "That would be nice," Norma says. 
</P>

 Terri Crisp was a goner the first time she saw the puppy. He was lying in a 
cage at the West Valley Animal Shelter in Chatsworth "with this lampshade thing 
on his head and these 'poor, pitiful me' eyes that just pull you in." 
</P>
<P>
 Crisp, director of disaster services for Sacramento-based United Animal 
Nations, and 45 volunteers had come to rescue earthquake-displaced animals, not 
to adopt them. 
</P>
<P>
 When she left her home in Santa Clara, her husband Ken had these parting 
words: 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not to come home with anything that has four legs, or three legs, or 
two legs . . . " After all, she had returned from the Midwest floods with six 
cats and three dogs to adopt out. (They already had three dogs and seven cats.) 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Crisp says, "It was just like Shaker was talking to me. He 
wanted to tell someone what he'd been through." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaker had been found the day after the quake near the Northridge Meadows 
Apartments and brought to the shelter in bad shape, his left rear leg nearly 
severed. Collarless and malnourished, he was signed in as a beagle-terrier mix. 
But Crisp suspects he may be something bigger, much bigger. Already, he's more 
than doubled in size and he has big feet. 
</P>
<P>
 He's white, with black and brown blotches here and there. Funny-looking, some 
might say. "Really cute," says Crisp -- and smart. 
</P>
<P>
 She plans for him to be the first American dog formally trained to search for 
animals in trouble in the wake of a disaster. "I said, 'Shaker, what better dog 
to do this job? You've been through it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now healed, he is being trained to wear a backpack. Next stop: one of those 
academies that teaches drug-sniffing dogs and people-rescuing dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, graduate school under Professor Crisp. Shaker has all those siblings to 
practice on -- including a a quake-displaced cockatiel dubbed "Eppy" (as in 
epicenter), which Crisp also took home to Santa Clara.
