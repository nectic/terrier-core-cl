AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: NO EXCUSES. JUSTICE WILL NOT BE DENIED

<P>
 The mail brings greetings. You're wanted -- for jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
 You panic. There must be some way -- any way -- to wiggle out. You're 
expecting the flu? Your dog can't stay home alone? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't tell Ava Prothro. She's heard it all. For five years, she's been jury 
supervisor for the West District, L.A. County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll tell you about the woman who swore that, if made to serve, she'd wear 
earplugs and a blindfold in the courtroom. "Tell it to the judge," Prothro told 
Reluctant Citizen, who instead wangled a doctor's excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll tell you about the man who showed up wearing a dress. He ended up being 
reassigned from Santa Monica Superior Court, Prothro's home base, to Culver 
City. She's always wondered how he fared. 
</P>
<P>
 And she'll tell you about prospective jurors who swear they don't speak 
English. "We get that from people who are personnel directors -- for American 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Each Monday and Tuesday morning, a new flock of candidates, most of them 
Westsiders, reports to the Santa Monica courthouse. There, Prothro and her 
aides guide them through the ABCs of jurydom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to be cruel or trying to torture you," she assures them. 
Some seem unconvinced. They've done this before. B-O-R-I-N-G. "We try not to 
bring jurors here to sit, put puzzles together, watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch is from noon to 1:30. "I trust you'll be back -- and hopefully in the 
same condition you left in," she tells them. Yes, jurors have returned drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Going shopping at nearby Santa Monica Place? Fine, but watch the clock. "I had 
a judge fine a juror the amount she spent shopping. She held up the court for 
20 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 At any time, Prothro may have 300 jurors on call. In a high-profile case -- 
such as the 1991 manslaughter trial of Marlon Brando's son Christian -- 
attorneys reject dozens of would-be jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one that really sticks in my mind," Prothro says, "is the People v. 
Garmanian. About 700 jurors went through this courtroom. We had jurors on top 
of jurors." (Rodney Garmanian, a security guard, was convicted in 1991 of the 
murder and attempted rape of Teak Dyer, 18, in Pacific Palisades). 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, jurors try to avoid criminal cases. They'll tell Prothro, "I 
think they're all guilty" or "all Hispanics and blacks are guilty." They'll 
claim they have religious bias. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a mutinous juror scream that she was holding him prisoner and try to 
start a mass rebellion. She had to have a profane heckler ejected. "He thought, 
'That did it.' " He was out of there. No more jury duty. He underestimated Ava 
Prothro, though, who didn't excuse him. 
</P>
<P>
 Some want to serve, but are rejected repeatedly during voir dire . "I tell 
them, 'Don't take it personally. You were probably too smart to be on that 
panel.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even she can't figure out what makes attorneys click when it comes to picking 
jurors. "You can come in here with green hair," she says, and get on a jury. 
"One woman, a bag lady type with hot-pink makeup covering her face, made it to 
alternate. I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a teacher dealing with sullen students, Prothro patiently settles 
squabbles over whether the TV should be on in the assembly room and calms 
knitters angry about being barred from bringing their needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the harmless eccentrics, such as the man who came to her window 
smiling smugly and holding up a jigsaw puzzle piece. "See this?" he asked. 
"Those people over there are looking all over for it." 
</P>
<P>
 And there are the grumblers, who are not about to be pacified by $5 a day plus 
mileage. Prothro tries to convince them that jury duty is a civic 
responsibility. "Don't talk politics if you don't vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she understands that they are giving their time and "our job is to try 
to make it as pleasant as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 A few go AWOL. Prothro sent a marshal to find a woman who'd refused to give 
her home phone number. She was given a choice: a day in jail, a $200 fine or 
writing an essay on the importance of being a juror. She paid the fine and came 
back. After that, "She never complained about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 With up to 300 new jurors reporting each week, Prothro says, some think, 
"There's no way she can keep track of all these people. Little do they know." 
</P>
<P>
 She also is in continual contact with the 18 courtrooms. What will be the next 
day's needs? How many on-call jurors will she need? At week's end, she and 
Superior Court presiding judge David Rothman consult on the week ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if you just toss that little summons? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Prothro says, "they still have you in the system." The county has 
begun a no-response study and "they're going into the 1992 file." You could be 
getting new greetings. 
</P>
<P>
 All good and well, you say, for Prothro to preach about duty. She doesn't have 
to serve. Wrong. Recently, she was summoned for jury duty in Torrance. She 
never made it to a jury box. Seeing Things Differently 
</P>
<P>
 For most people who live in South-Central Los Angeles, Martin Luther King 
Jr.'s dream remains a dream unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the premise of "The American City: Rethinking the Urban Agenda," a 
UCLA Extension program marking the 65th anniversary of the civil rights 
leader's birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderator Eugene Grigsby, director of the UCLA Center for Afro-American 
Studies, set the tone: "Economics is a social problem" -- something King 
understood and preached. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than three decades later, Grigsby added, "It seems to me we're very 
good at reminiscing . . . and wringing our hands," but not at "setting an 
agenda that we want other people to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 He posed the question other speakers would repeat: "Where's our piece of the 
pie?" 
</P>
<P>
 Keynoter Paul C. Hudson, president and CEO of Broadway Federal Savings and 
Loan, laid it out in dollars and cents: low wages, lack of access to business 
capital and "leakage of income" out of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, major retailers are unwilling to come to South-Central. "How 
can we be blamed for going to the Beverly Center . . . when we can't get our 
son's Air Jordans at the swap meet?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Joy Rogers of the Los Angeles Urban League suggested that the 
South-Central community also needs to rethink how it deals with the rest of 
society: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no longer just whites not liking blacks. It's everyone else not liking 
blacks and sometimes blacks not liking other people." It's time, she said, to 
deal with black-on-black crime and with drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 It is crucial, speakers said, that workers discard any notions of getting jobs 
in some reborn aerospace or auto industry and train for jobs in a high-tech 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 And they dismissed public projects that bring only temporary jobs to their 
community. Hudson cited the Century Freeway, which cuts through South-Central. 
Now that it's finished, "There's no reason to get off (it) to buy anything."

INK / PAUL D. COLFORD: O'NEILL'S BOOK TELLS THE WAY IT WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, Paul D. Colford is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr., who died on Jan. 5 at age 
81, was a gregarious pol of the old school and a raconteur with a lifetime of 
tales. In a final splash of his Irish charm, he has left behind a book that 
could serve as his coda, laying out the rules of the political game as he loved 
to play it. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Politics Is Local," published this month by Times Books, offers lessons 
such as these: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Never Forget Whence You Came": Young John F. Kennedy, told by one Patsy 
McDuff that a neighborhood leader was hospitalized for "trouble with his 
phosphate," corrected Patsy by saying, "That's prostate ." To which Patsy 
remarked, "There he goes with that Harvard accent again." O'Neill concludes: 
"The lesson is: You grow but the folks back home may not grow along with you." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Never Get Introduced to the Crowd at Sports Events": They booed O'Neill 
before a heavyweight bout in Worcester, Mass., as he feared they would. "People 
go to sports events to enjoy the action. They feel intruded upon if some 
outsider imposes on what they paid good money for." 
</P>
<P>
 * "All Politics Is Local": The name of O'Neill's book comes from the adage 
impressed on him by his father -- namely, never take your own back yard for 
granted. Or as O'Neill put it, "A politician learns that if a constituent calls 
about a problem, even if it's a street light out, you don't tell them to call 
City Hall. You call City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill's sentiments are peppered by personal asides (he was against term 
limitations, for example) and by recollections of colorful characters such as 
his old pal Jimmie Burke, who gave him this advice on how to deal with 
reporters who are out to get you: "Don't write it if you can talk, don't talk 
if you can wink, and don't wink if you can nod." 
</P>
<P>
 With a moral tale every two pages or so, "All Politics Is Local" is to 
politics what "Harvey Penick's Little Red Book" is to golf -- a sage primer 
that goes down fast and smooth.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tip saw himself as a storyteller, and others saw him as a fountain of good 
political common sense," said Times Books Publisher Peter Osnos. It fell to 
Osnos and editor Jonathan Karp to pinpoint the moral in each of the tales they 
planned to use (because O'Neill himself wasn't one to moralize). Anecdotes that 
lacked a redeeming lesson were axed -- "and sometimes this was like ripping 
Tip's soul out," said Gary Hymel, one of O'Neill's former administrative 
assistants. "After all, some of these stories had served him well for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Times Books, whose sister company Random House sold 340,000 hard-cover copies 
of O'Neill's autobiography, "Man of the House" (1987), printed 80,000 of "All 
Politics Is Local" before O'Neill died of cardiac arrest. And O'Neill, though 
slowed by arthritis, had eagerly made the early rounds of book promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 As Osnos recalled, the editorial process also involved an enviable weekend 
last summer at O'Neill's home on Cape Cod, where the expansive Tip schmoozed 
out a lot of his text during hearty meals of chowder and steak, followed by the 
cigars he savored on the veranda. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance of politics has changed so radically through the years, with the 
electronic media now calling most of the steps, that O'Neill's book provides a 
useful reminder if not of the way things ought to be, at least of the way 
things used to be, cigars and all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the Racks: Architectural Digest devotes its January issue to the domestic 
splendors of Italy, including a rare visit to Gore Vidal's villa in Ravello, 
overlooking the Amalfi Coast. The photos make it easy to see why this has long 
been the writer's permanent residence. "In the early days I'd be inspired to 
take on a movie to get the pool finished," he confesses. "That's a powerful 
inspiration. I always date things by which book, which money, built it." His 
novel "Lincoln," for example, helped pay for the pool house and sauna. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 B Matter: The death last week of Virginia Kelley, President Clinton's mother, 
has accelerated Simon & Schuster's plans to publish her autobiography. 
Originally scheduled for next fall, "Leading With My Heart" will now be 
released in May . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Adler Hennessee has signed with Random House to write a biography of 
Betty Friedan . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Richard M. Nixon has written the foreword to a compact 
compendium, "The Wit & Wisdom of Winston Churchill" (HarperCollins), put 
together by Churchill authority James C. Humes. Nixon says: "Churchill is one 
of the few statesmen who occupied both the world of thought and the world of 
action. Most of Churchill's observations carry with them both the dimensions of 
actual experience and the knowledge of history."

BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; SEEKING SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT IN A TIME OF VIOLENCE 
AND DESPAIR; NOT WHERE I STARTED FROM BY KATE WHEELER ; HOUGHTON MIFFLIN, 
$19.95, 241 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRISON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The conclusion to "Ringworm," the last story of Kate Wheeler's debut 
collection, "Not Where I Started From," bears a warning from a Buddhist abbot 
to a young American nun who is about to shed her robes and return to the 
temptations of the Western world. 
</P>
<P>
 He entreats her "not to describe cessation," cessation being the transcendent 
state of unfeeling reached in successful meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Once away from the monastery, the ex-nun reflects that "really there was 
nothing to describe, for there had been no experience, nothing on which to base 
a statement." 
</P>
<P>
 The search for this paradoxical "unexperience" is central to many of Wheeler's 
stories, and such a narrative strategy proves that the abbot was right: One 
shouldn't try to describe the indescribable, or if one must try, then one must 
succeed. Kate Wheeler's prose is deft, but her focus on that for which there 
are no words means that she has chosen an arena necessarily resistant to her 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 In another story, "Snow Leopard, Night Bird," Carol, who has a business 
delivering designer meals to New Age yuppies, falls under the thrall of a guru, 
Edward Hassan, a native of Houston who achieved enlightenment in India. Despite 
their doubts, Edward's followers largely submit to his abusive attempts to push 
their consciousness beyond the meaningless chaos of material life. In the end, 
however, Carol grows disillusioned; when she touches what is left of a burned 
photograph of the guru, the image disintegrates -- with too-obvious meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget enlightenment. It's all a game anyway," Edward had admitted to her 
previously, an idea that no one suggests to Martina, the young woman in the 
story "Manikarnika," who tries to assimilate the terrible fact of her father's 
suicide as she watches Hindu cremations on the banks of the Ganges in India. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course Martina cannot reconcile her father's suicide as easily as the 
mystical fires consume the corpses; she leaves the river sick and confused, and 
later nearly causes a riot when she tries to take an illicit photograph of a 
cremation.  
</P>
<P>
 As one and then another story makes clear, the choice for these women -- all 
of these tales are about women -- is that between denying and admitting their 
fear, a fear often precipitated by the collection of First- and Third-World 
values, whether in the person of the spiritual seeker or in geographic fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern religious practices allow some of Wheeler's characters to arrive at a 
point where feeling is denied, obliterated for as long as the transcendence of 
meditation lasts, but then the obvious troubles of the world beyond the 
cloister intrude. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of these stories are set in Asia or South America, where 
expatriates acquire a panicked self-loathing when they try to live consciously 
in the Third World, their veils of safety and of privilege falling away before 
the intimate revelations of starvation, political violence and disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, these travelers have been frightened before: They are not so much 
traveling as fleeing the collapse of relationships, whether their own failed 
romances or the dissolution of their parents' marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories offer a preponderance of treacherous fathers who cheat on mothers, 
commit suicide or touch their daughters incestuously. In Wheeler's cosmos even 
those sexual awakenings that are not taboo are shocking and violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Improving My Average" (the first and strongest story of the collection) shows 
sexuality being introduced to a very young girl by a retarded teen-ager 
masturbating in public. 
</P>
<P>
 To transcend their fear of violence and of despair, Wheeler's women seek the 
aid of holy men, and the knowledge of the East is pursued in these stories with 
a sort of diligence and application that is decidedly Western. 
</P>
<P>
 The young nun in "Ringworm" has come to the monastery in Burma because it 
reputedly offers "the world's strictest, most effective technique for spiritual 
enlightenment." Such language is Puritan and rational in its impatient demand 
for results.  
</P>
<P>
 "To know the reasons for everything -- why red is red and black, black; why 
human eyes see only the colors that objects have rejected -- and then, to know 
what lay past reasons. Emptiness? Such notions drew her heart like iron 
filings." These are Martina's thoughts as she arrives in the city on the holy 
Ganges, where she hopes to "be enlightened by lunchtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler's writing, too, has its magnetism; but just as the idea of 
transcendence tantalizes more often than it occurs during meditation, the 
stories in "Not Where I Started From" don't quite arrive where one had hoped.

MARGARET HONDA: GIVING THE GIFT OF INSIGHT; ART: SHE TELLS A NEWPORT HARBOR 
MUSEUM AUDIENCE THAT THE AIM OF HER WORKS IS TO EXPLORE THE FREQUENT CHASM 
BETWEEN PERCEPTION AND REALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Conceptual artist Margaret Honda's favorite adage might be You Can't Always 
Trust What You See. With some of her work, it's safest to heed that warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Her installation "Gift," shown at Santa Monica's Shoshana Wayne Gallery late 
last year for instance, consists of identical, unlabeled brown glass bottles, 
each filled with a white powdery substance and displayed so that viewers could 
sample them. Half the bottles contain powdered sugar; the other half contain 
boric acid, commonly used as roach poison. 
</P>
<P>
 "League," another recent piece installed at the same gallery in late 1992, 
looks harmless, even alluring, from afar. But up close, its myriad, silvery 
elements, suspended from the ceiling low enough for viewers to bump into, 
clearly were large fishhooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people were so terrified that they couldn't move" through the 
installation alone and had to be helped out, Honda said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 She discussed her recent work at a noon talk at Newport Harbor Art Museum. She 
is among 18 emerging regional artists in the museum's fourth biennial show, 
titled "Southern California 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that she has aims to terrorize or poison anyone. No viewers actually 
tasted either the sugar or boric acid in "Gift," Honda said. (A Shoshana Wayne 
Gallery owner said she had no fear of anyone sampling the powders because 
gallery visitors know never to touch artworks, and even if they did, the 
foul-tasting boric acid is harmful to humans only if ingested in large 
quantities). 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego artist's aim, she said, is to explore the frequent chasm between 
perception and reality, and between expectation and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in how you know what it is you're looking at and what 
resources you bring to figuring out what you're looking at," Honda said. " 
'League,' " she said, was "about perceived danger and real danger, and it deals 
with your expectations (about) what's going to happen and what's not going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gift" addresses the limitation of visual perception, Honda continued. In 
other words, even though viewers may see the bottles of sugar and boric acid, 
they can't know for certain what it is they're looking at unless they utilize 
another sense, that of taste. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within the installation, Honda conceals some of the bottles in finely crafted 
wood boxes with frosted glass lids. The lids slide off to clearly reveal the 
bottles, "but even though you can see the bottles, you're not exactly sure what 
you're looking at," she said. "You can't necessarily tell things apart 
visually, but you can in other ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Honda's contribution to the museum's biennial is two 1993 pieces that each 
consist of a single, small dark red wood box. They too deal with the gap 
between perception and reality, but, she said, in terms of "seduction and 
betrayal." 
</P>
<P>
 As a Sansei (a U.S. or Canadian citizen whose grandparents emigrated from 
Japan), Honda named one work "Urashima Taro," the title of an ancient Japanese 
fable similar to the Greek myth of Pandora, after which she titled her second 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Both fables, she writes in the exhibit catalogue, are stories in which "a gift 
is proffered, only to the ruination of the recipient." 
</P>
<P>
 The moral of each story, she said, is that there was "a price to pay" for 
seeing things in a new, different way. That is a worthwhile risk, she 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The work Honda is probably best known for is an earlier series, first shown in 
Long Beach in the late 1980s, of animal traps devised of wood, wire and other 
materials. This work also explores seduction and betrayal in that unsuspecting 
animals are seduced or lured in some way, only to be injured or killed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One is modeled after a 19th-Century wolf trap, consisting of a sharp knife 
piece embedded in a chunk of animal fat. It was designed, she said, so that 
when one wolf licked the fat, it would cut its tongue. Then, the scent of 
animal fat mixed with blood would draw other wolves, but, unable to find a 
carcass, they would become "enraged," she said, "and supposedly devour each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 While she said that all "traps are all cruel," her attempt was not to 
communicate whether she thought a trap was used to "good" purpose -- such as 
gathering food -- or to "bad" -- mere destruction, as in the case of the wolf 
trap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left the whole moral issue ambiguous in this show," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda also sought to employ ambiguity in "Sift," an installation included in a 
1992 Long Beach group show of art by 10 Sansei artists about their parents or 
grandparents who, like Honda's parents, were interned at relocation camps 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sift" consisted of three large metal sieves, one as big as four feet in 
diameter, which represented the way in which internees were "sifted out of the 
population" into the camps, Honda said, and forbidden from speaking Japanese in 
an effort to "filter out their sense of community." 
</P>
<P>
 Honda attempted, however, to avoid endowing the work with a single 
interpretation, hoping to reflect the ambiguity she felt while researching it: 
The secondhand accounts she read weren't written by her parents, but by others, 
thus the facts of her family's involvement "seemed very nebulous." 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to present things that can (elicit) a wide range of responses," Honda 
said. "This piece doesn't necessarily look like it deals with internment." 
</P>
<P>
 It did, however, to at least one audience member, Newport Beach financial 
adviser Gerald P. Sakura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was interned" during World War II, Sakura said during a question-answer 
period. "I get the point here." 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; 'MURDER ON NILE' COASTS ON CONVERSATION; WESTMINSTER 
COMMUNITY'S WELL-DRESSED CAST MAKES THE TALK WORK IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 
CHARACTER PLAY, BUT THE PRODUCTION IS BARREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Murder on the Nile" follows many of the formulas that have made its author, 
Dame Agatha Christie, the traditional queen of murder mysteries. Isolate an 
eccentric collection of humanity from the world, kill one of them and give 
everyone else a motive for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In Christie's most popular plays, "Ten Little Indians" and "The Mousetrap," 
she gives us not one victim, but a whole series of them. The characters are 
murdered one after another, and it is a matter of survival to discover the 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder on the Nile" is a rather different stage animal. It's a play about the 
characters rather than the crime. There is a murder, of course, but more than 
anything else, there is a great deal of talk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster Community Theatre production of "Murder on the Nile" is 
modestly successful at making the talk interesting, thanks largely to a cast 
that is clear-spoken and well-dressed in designer June Steneck's classy 
black-and-white costumes.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steneck's costumes definitely suggest the '40s, but the black-and-white 
production design backfires with the set, which is visually and dramatically 
barren. The story is set on the observation deck of a paddle steamer going down 
the Nile, but the heat and the scenery are only talk: The production never 
leaves Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Marc LeBlanc's staging is arid enough. There's nothing to do on this 
observation deck except to talk. Consequently, movement is awkward, motivated 
by sight lines rather than action. Even the drinks are brought in from offstage 
by the steward (played by Bill Meadows in the one performance that is touched 
with a sense of humor). 
</P>
<P>
 The net result is a rather sleepy evening, roused by a few gunshots. The real 
firepower of the play, waiting to be triggered into blazing looks and deadly 
innuendo, is still lurking, undetected, in all that talk. 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; BENNY GREEN SHOWS HIS VERSATILITY AT CATALINA'S; THE PIANIST'S 
TRIO MIXES TECHNIQUE AND GENTLE LYRICISM IN A SUPERB SET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When you say he's got it all, you've said it all. That is the most concise 
summation of the genius of pianist Benny Green, whose trio opened at Catalina's 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to him now, you understand why Oscar Peterson invited him to Toronto 
last year to share with him the prestigious Glenn Gould Foundation Award. It's 
not just his technique, though his ad lib parallel octave lines in "Ain't She 
Sweet" almost defied belief; it's also his gentle lyricism, as in an old Billy 
Eckstine song, "I Want to Talk About You." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At times his speed is dazzling; one unaccompanied solo swung no less vibrantly 
than the trio passages. Part of his current success, though, is because of the 
superb collective personality of his group. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian McBride, who was not quite out of his teens when he first played 
with Green two years ago, works in tight cohesion with him on the arranged 
passages, as does the drummer Kenny Washington, who is equally effective 
whether backing Green with brushes and sticks or soloing, as he did on one 
number, with mallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Green is establishing himself as a composer. Two of his originals at Tuesday's 
first set were dedicated to musicians he admires: "Ray B.," for bassist Ray 
Brown, in whose trio he worked last year, and "Wiggin'," for pianist Gerald 
Wiggins, who was in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 When he is not amazing the crowd with his more obvious virtues, Green shows 
himself capable of graceful messages, as in Clare Fischer's "Pensativa" and the 
almost Basie-like simplicity of "You're a Sweetheart." In short, whatever Benny 
Green has to say at the piano, he will make his statement with the consummate 
ease he has achieved in the past couple of eventful years. 
</P>
<P>
 Green's trio will be at Catalina's through Sunday.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SHERYL CROW TAKES OFF IN A BLUESY DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheryl Crow is probably the first pop artist of note since Randy Newman to 
pointedly mention Santa Monica Boulevard in a song. (Her context is as 
unflattering as his: drunks in a beer bar gazing at the carwash across the 
street.)Perhaps appropriately, then, her first area headlining show since her 
debut album was given Tuesday at that street's Troubadour, where there was 
plenty of reason to quote the "I love it" part from the other guy's tune. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rare someone with natural chops -- natural enough to have earned her a 
lot of paychecks as a prominent backup singer -- who's gone on to develop a 
strong, quirky songwriting ear too, Crow is the only new female mainstream 
rocker worth much attention. Probably wisely, Crow has picked a touring band 
that doesn't try to re-create the expert eccentricities of "Tuesday Night Music 
Club," one of last year's cleverest pop albums, but that rocks vehemently and 
draws out her bluesier side, with Crow herself handling some of the 
vintage-organ work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One former employer, Don Henley, came out during an encore to duet on the 
lovely "No One Said It Would Be Easy," and didn't at all overshadow her. 
</P>
<P>
 Better-'n-you'd-expect remakes of "I've Got a Feeling" and the Stones' "Happy" 
underscored her plethora of "classic rock" leanings, which in Crow's case 
actually sound classic enough not to fall under the Undue Nostalgia Department.

SERVING UP A WINNING 'COMBINATION'; MOVIES: NOW THAT ASIAN FILMS HAVE ACQUIRED 
A CERTAIN CACHET, TONY CHAN HOPES HIS ACCLAIMED DEBUT FEATURE WILL JOIN THE 
LIST -- AND OPEN DOORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 About Tony Chan, there's good news and bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the good news: "Combination Platter," the New York-based director's 
debut feature about illegal immigrants in a Chinese restaurant, has gotten a 
warm critical reception in the cities where it's already been seen -- it will 
open in Los Angeles Jan. 28 at the Sunset 5 -- as well as at the dozen or so 
international film festivals it's visited. And when Chan makes his next film, 
he probably won't have to drag the same print around to every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty dirty now," Chan says. "It's got a lot of mileage on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the situation for Asian American filmmakers has improved enormously 
since Chan borrowed $100,000 or so from his parents, shot most of his film at 
night in their Queens restaurant -- which, Chan has to admit, saved him a lot 
on catering -- took it to last year's Sundance Film Festival where it got great 
word-of-mouth and was still virtually the last film there to find a 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, I couldn't have shown anyone my film," said Chan, 25, who 
shared the Waldo Salt screenwriting award at Sundance with his writing partner, 
Edwin Baker. "And if someone had asked me what's the most successful Asian 
American film, I couldn't tell them. I couldn't name one." 
</P>
<P>
 That's changed, of course, which is more good news. With the success of Wayne 
Wang's "The Joy Luck Club" and Ang Lee's "The Wedding Banquet," the critical 
acclaim afforded Hong Kong action wizard John Woo, and mainland directors like 
Chen Kaige ("Farewell My Concubine") and Zhang Yimou ("Raise the Red Lantern"), 
films with and by Asians have acquired a certain cachet. That they happen to be 
good films doesn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, I think things run in cycles," Chan said. "Why in the '60s, for 
instance, was French New Wave so popular? But I think Asian Americans have a 
unique cultural background. I'm bilingual. I lived in Hong Kong till I was 13 
and then I moved here. So our background is really unique, and our films 
reflect it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there's another Asian American filmmaker whose parents own a 
restaurant, there isn't going to be another 'Combination Platter.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes, the bad news. When Chan was writing "Combination Platter," he spent a 
month and a half -- six days a week, seven to eight hours a day -- working on 
the screenplay. Because of that long effort, he's been a tad slow getting his 
next script rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a ghost story, a Chinatown ghost story, but I'm still 
writing," he said, sitting in the offices of Bluehorse Films, his production 
company in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood. "But everyone always said, you make 
an independent film, and you spend the next eight months promoting it. I mean, 
it's you they want to talk to. It's not like we have Tom Cruise." 
</P>
<P>
 He does, however, have Jeff Lau, who since making "Combination Platter" has 
returned to his job as a stockbroker. ("It's a pretty good job," Chan says. 
"And how many roles are there for Asian men?") But Lau leaves an indelible 
impression as Robert, the film's main character and an illegal immigrant from 
Hong Kong caught in a vortex of conflicted beliefs, biases and ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperately seeking a green card, he tries to arrange a show marriage, first 
with a Chinese American woman who tries to extort him, then with a white woman 
named Claire (Colleen O'Brien), who agitates his xenophobic instincts. At the 
same time, the atmosphere within the restaurant, which serves as an incubator 
for misshapen American dreams, is poisoned by the strained relations among the 
waiters, all of whom come from Hong Kong, and the kitchen staff, all of whom 
are mainlanders. Adding to the tension is the fact that they can't really 
communicate because of their differing dialects. 
</P>
<P>
 Language is a crucial concept for Chan, both in his story and his life; as a 
young man, he says, he was drawn to the visual because of the language barrier 
he faced as a new American. On the other hand, the cultural barriers faced by 
-- and erected by -- immigrants of all stripes is something he has tried to 
help, in his small way, to tear down. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes the idea that there might be other Tony Chans out there, trying to 
make their first film, needing money -- and because of "Combination Platter" 
might have a better chance of getting some. "Now, at least, somebody's got a 
track record," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The press roller-coaster is about to end on "Combination Platter," so Chan can 
get back to writing. "I may even get a part-time job in Chinatown," he said. 
No, he said: no food, no restaurants, no immigration. But a job in Chinatown 
would allow him to research that ghost story he wants to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything I write is going to have something to do with Asians," he said, 
"although I'm open. If someone offers me a screenplay that had nothing to do 
with Asians, but it was great and I could identify with it, it would be foolish 
to pass up the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't want to make "Moonstruck." But, then again, he says, "No one ever 
asks why Bertolucci did 'The Last Emperor.' "

ART REVIEW; AN ENTHUSIASTIC EMBRACE OF POWERFUL AMBIGUITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Kersels' first solo show ranks among the best debuts of the last few 
years. Funny and engaging, but also creepy and slightly frightening, its power 
resides in its enthusiastic embrace of ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking into A/B Gallery feels like climbing through the backside of a 
gigantic cuckoo-clock. Weights dangle from pulleys and ropes. Mechanisms jump, 
jitter, stutter and sway, repeatedly measuring off uneven segments of time. 
Gears rotate relentlessly, stopping and starting on irregular schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 The incessant hum fills the crowded gallery. Once in a while, through the 
clamorous scraping, clanking and banging of Kersels' awkward installation, a 
melodic pulse of music makes its way into your ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than providing respite from the cacophonous exhibition, the faint music 
intensifies the intrigue. You find yourself paying attention to slowly 
unfolding patterns of sound and movement, increasingly unsure of what's central 
or peripheral to Kersels' intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Several models of artmaking compete for your attention, often stretching its 
span beyond ordinary limits. "Monkey Pod" and "Speaker Slam" propose that art 
is either a household appliance with a life of its own, or a Sisyphean task 
that is as frustrating to witness as it is to undertake. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that art is an invisible essence takes hilarious shape in a piece 
that uses the vibrations of a flame to do the work of a stereo speaker. In 
"Twist," a prosthetic leg that spastically dances at the end of a rubber-band 
rope, the idea that an artist controls his work in the same way that a 
puppeteer controls his marionette is asserted and undermined. 
</P>
<P>
 Kersels' best piece is the least aggressive. "Precious Dancer" is a 23-minute 
Super-8 movie of the artist dancing by himself to pop, soul and Moroccan music. 
Projected onto a few inches of the gallery wall, the tiny home movie is 
surprisingly free of the self-involvement (and self-obsession) that is so much 
a part of contemporary art. The piece ingeniously side-steps the demand that 
art be ruthlessly self-conscious -- a demand that has driven advanced art for 
more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Captivation and joy replace intellectual one-upmanship. As you squat and watch 
Kersels dance with his eyes closed, you're less concerned with what might be 
going on in his mind and more caught up in the endearingly sweet movements of 
his body. The simple fact that he might be taking pleasure in his art is enough 
to get us to take pleasure in our viewing, which these days is to risk being 
foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 This openness can be traced to the fact that Kersels isn't afraid to make a 
fool of himself in public. His three-dimensional gizmos that move and make 
noise are a mature meditation on art's capacity to communicate. Although too 
early to tell, it's not too late to hope that Kersels' work is part of a larger 
artistic sea-change -- a long overdue shift away from self-assured, 
narrow-minded message mongering, and toward a riskier, more open-ended approach 
to the ways meaning actually travels between artists and viewers.

ART REVIEWS; GOOFINESS THAT STANDS THE TEST OF TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Grieger's works from 1968-73 were made 10 years too early to get the 
attention they deserve. His hilarious photographs, irreverent sculptures and 
absurd paintings also were made on the wrong side of the country to earn more 
than disdain and dismissal from New York's provincial art world. Adding insult 
to injury, a group of New York-based artists became famous in the '80s for 
making art based on the same ideas Grieger had explored a decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 A historically important -- and scathingly spirited -- exhibition at Margo 
Leavin Gallery offers an eye-popping antidote to this skewed and shortsighted 
view of recent art history. Organized by critic Dave Hickey for the University 
of Nevada, Las Vegas, "Scott Grieger: Impersonations and Combinations 1968-73" 
playfully demonstrates that art-about-art is best when it's also about life. 
</P>
<P>
 A side-splitting series of black-and-white photographs depict the young 
Grieger posing as trademark sculptures by acclaimed modern masters. On hands 
and knees, with a tire around his belly, he mimics Robert Rauschenberg's famous 
goat sculpture. Leaning rigidly against the wall, he pretends to be a John 
McCracken plank. Poised like a mechanical ballerina, he imitates a George 
Rickey sculpture. Enlarged to monstrous proportions, his feet take on the scale 
of an outdoor Oldenburg. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of Grieger's jokes is not simply to deflate the reputations of 
fellow artists. His goal is to show that if looking at art is merely a matter 
of identifying artists, viewers miss out on the most valuable aspects of the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pieces combine signature styles of formalist painters and Minimalist 
sculptors in odd blends that look like hallucinatory juxtapositions in a modern 
art history textbook. A Newman "zip" painting warps to resemble a Stella 
polygon; Larry Poons' dots appear on Robert Morris' sagging felt, and a 
reductive Judd is interrupted by Johns' fragmented faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieger mocks the idea of artistic purebreds. His bastardized offspring of 
high modernism seem to have resulted from inbreeding rather than to have 
descended through history with proper pedigrees and credentials. Footballs, 
guitars, windshield wipers, cows, pole-vaulters, butterflies and spider webs 
also play important roles in his promiscuous mixture of culture's far-flung 
spheres. 
</P>
<P>
 The main difference between Grieger's appropriations and those from New York 
in the '80s is that his attacked a substantial opponent in the real world 
rather than illustrated a stale lesson from art school. Without the unruly edge 
of Grieger's appropriations, the New York version functioned as a safe, 
intellectual exercise, selling like hot cakes and serving up a hollow 
institutional critique as the new style of institutionally sanctioned art. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieger's goofy hybrids are significant because they don't put art on a 
pedestal, but invite us to mix it and match it with anything that suits us. His 
early works not only remind us that high art has its source in low culture, but 
that both are enriched when they momentarily sidestep institutional authority 
and freely intermingle with the desires of their viewers.

 Wacky Visual Dance: Roy Dowell's snappy collages have no qualms about grabbing 
any available pair of eyeballs and bouncing them around the room like a couple 
of pinballs in a machine that won't tilt no matter how hard you nudge, bump, 
shimmy and shove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon entering Rosamund Felsen Gallery, your eyes are immediately jump-started 
(or hijacked) out of their ordinary perceptual habits. Put simply, your optical 
machinery is unable to filter out extraneous information. The mind can't focus 
on the essentials and disregard the incidentals because this difference doesn't 
make sense in Dowell's complexly overloaded art. 
</P>
<P>
 His small- to mid-size images, present a jazzy pulse of scintillating visual 
energy. Out of control, this jolt skips across diverse textures, slides through 
various styles, ricochets off competing schools of abstraction, and circulates 
around alternate methods of representation. 
</P>
<P>
 An odd pair of painted sculptures translate into three dimensions the optical 
gymnastics for which Dowell's collages are well known. The larger work fumbles, 
merely illustrating ideas he has more successfully worked out by cutting and 
pasting pieces of paper. The more eccentric, smaller sculpture -- which 
includes a circus poster clothespinned to a metal skirt, a child's chair and 
two paint-slathered socker balls -- jubilantly catapults abstract visual 
dynamics into the space the body occupies. 
</P>
<P>
 This wacky dance picks up momentum in the collages as your eye careens around 
sweeping contours and dips into illusionistic depths. As planes disappear 
behind perfectly placed, overlapping planes, the rollicking rhythm suddenly 
breaks. You lose your place only to find yourself somewhere else, mesmerized by 
the pleasures that percolate in Dowell's restless pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 At once relentless and generous, the wild ride of viewing these works is 
different every time. Powerfully permissive, enthusiastically anarchic and 
rambunctiously disruptive, his multifaceted abstractions are also disciplined 
and carefully poised. Politically, they're radically democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Made from torn fragments of billboards and posters, these punchy images 
recycle the detritus of advertising in order to form statements that are 
simultaneously intimate and accessible, highly personal and widely shared. 
Dowell's idiosyncratic orchestrations of line, shape and color mix metaphors 
with a vengeance, putting unpredictability back into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 If his cacophonous collages were pieces of writing, they'd be fragmented non 
sequiturs. Even so, they'd add up to coherent stories and detailed 
articulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The meticulous deliberation and exquisite facility of Dowell's painted 
collages open onto an indeterminate space from which the rules that govern 
ordinary existence are held momentarily at bay so that something more wonderful 
might take place. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; VANDROSS CHARMS FANS WITH FINESSE; THE SINGER, WHO PLAYS THE 
ANAHEIM ARENA TONIGHT WITH OLETA ADAMS, DELIVERS A LONG SET SATISFYING IN ITS 
SIMPLICITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't ever accuse Luther Vandross of lacking confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 He airily informed the near-capacity crowd at the Forum recently that he was 
going to give them an evening of entertainment "you won't find anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as it isn't a boast if you can back it up, Vandross proceeded to deliver 
on his promise during a satisfying, two-hour-plus set. 
</P>
<P>
 While in the past the Los Angeles-based singer has favored lavish, 
Broadway-inspired stage productions, this time around, a slimmed-down Vandross 
was the picture of simplicity and restraint. With nothing to distract from his 
performance except backup singers sporting ball gowns that Scarlett O'Hara 
would have killed for, Vandross mesmerized his fans with pure vocal finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a voice. One would be hard-pressed to name another entertainer in his 
peer group who can surpass Vandross, who plays the Anaheim Arena tonight on a 
bill with Oleta Adams. He can take songs associated with other artists -- be it 
Brenda Russell's "Superstar" or Dionne Warwick's "A House Is Not a Home" -- and 
make the original versions seem emotionally anemic by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one appears to enjoy Vandross' singing more than Vandross himself, he 
does have a style that goes beyond mere skill and precision. Vandross isn't 
afraid to convey the loneliness and hurt that often go hand-in-hand with 
romance, a stance that other young, male, cool-at-all-costs singers studiously 
avoid. Though never lapsing into showy theatrics, Vandross gave a glossy spin 
to the R & B ballad "Never Let Me Go," popularized in the '60s by Aretha 
Franklin, without sacrificing any of the song's heart-wrenching poignancy.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vandross generously shared the stage with his backup singers, who included 
Lisa Fischer, winner of a Grammy in 1992 for "How Can I Ease the Pain." 
Possessing a voice reminiscent of Minnie Riperton's, Fischer made warm, 
personable contributions both in her own two-song segment and throughout the 
show. Probably the evening's most memorable aspect was watching Vandross serve 
as backup singer to Tawatha Agee, known to soul-music aficionados for her 
performance on the group Mtume's 1983 hit "Juicy Fruit." 
</P>
<P>
 While it was hard not to miss some of the over-the-top sets and costume 
changes of past Vandross shows, what remains is what made him a star in the 
first place: first-rate singing, combined with heartfelt emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Luther Vandross and Oleta Adams sing tonight at 7:30 p.m . at the Anaheim 
Arena, 2695 E. Katella Ave., Anaheim. $25. (714) 704-2500.

NEWS BITES : I SAY IT'S FLANK STEAK AND I SAY THE HECK WITH IT

 For those who don't like the flavor of flank steak, try this handy hint: 
Marinate three days in tamari soy and a little balsamic vinegar. It ends up 
tasting remarkably like liver! The Newest Mediterranean Cuisine 
</P>
<P>
 Cuisine Baladi (from the Arabic word for "country") is the fusion cuisine of 
modern Israel, combining local ingredients and Arab dishes with the influences 
brought by Jewish immigrants -- notably from Yemen, Morocco and India. Greater 
Galilee Olive Oil Co., which wants to make us Baladi-conscious, imports a 
luscious varietal olive oil entirely made from the Souri olive, various 
flavored olive oils, bottled olives and a number of interesting sauces. Among 
them are a well-made tahineh, an unusual orange chutney, several oil-less 
sauces (including a curry-like hot and sour garlic sauce) and tart, appetizing 
sauces made from the Arab thyme and sumac mixture zaatar. Available in Los 
Angeles at gourmet and health food stores such as Bristol Farms, Erewhon, Mrs. 
Gooch's; for mail order or Cuisine Baladi recipes, call (310) 459-9120 or (800) 
290-1391. Safe Sponge 
</P>
<P>
 Now it dawns on us. Yes, the Estracell II dish sponge (Newsbites, Nov. 18, 
1993) retards the growth of fungus and bacteria, but this doesn't mean, as we 
thought, that it contains a bacteriocide. The polyester material that Estracell 
II is made from just washes several times cleaner (and dries faster) than 
cellulose, so it doesn't give the bugs so much chance to grow in the first 
place. Pocket Pepper Pump 
</P>
<P>
 The Bonny Portable Pepper Mill is a pepper grinder that looks like, well, a 
white lipstick six inches long. The idea is that you put it in your purse or 
pocket and then whip it out at will for fresh pepper, without becoming 
obligated to a waiter for coming out and grinding some for you on one of those 
big mills. The cool part is that it works by pump action; it's all in the 
thumb. At supermarkets and cookwares stores. What's It All About, Algae? 
</P>
<P>
 Omega-3 fatty acids, found in the richer ocean fish, are thought to be good 
for your circulatory system. So biotechnologists are planning on harvesting 
omega-3 from algae and then enriching poultry feed with it in order to produce 
high-omega-3 chicken, turkey or even (gasp!) eggs. Why use poultry as a 
middleman? That's obvious: Nobody wants to eat algae. But why harvest omega-3 
from algae in the first place? Because that's where it comes from; that's where 
fish get it, for instance. I Need a Good Yak Wine 
</P>
<P>
 You tell WineSelect for Windows what you're going to serve, and the computer 
program suggests wines to serve with it, even generating a wine "shopping 
list." Understandably, the focus is mostly French, but hidden away in its 
several databases (which include a wine appreciation course) is a lot of 
international information, including how to say a votre sante in a surprising 
number of languages, including Mongol ( tanai eruul mendiin toloo ). It's 
$39.95 plus shipping from SkillMaster Software, (800) 949-6112. Requires three 
megabytes disk space and Windows 3.1 or higher. CHARLES PERRY

AMERICA'S BEST; HIGH STEAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want a great steak, you have to start with great beef. And then it has 
to be well aged for tenderness and flavor.As any butcher can tell you, this is 
easier said than done. Prime aged beef has become practically nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 70 years, Omaha Steaks has been selling succulent cornfed 
Nebraska beef to individuals and businesses all around America. And year after 
year, many of these customers have been ordering gift packages for their 
beef-loving friends, relatives, employees and business associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Aged to perfection, the steaks arrive by Federal Express two-day air, wedged 
in a reusable Styrofoam cooler, along with a copy of the Omaha Steaks Good Life 
Guide & Cookbook and cooking chart. Four six-ounce, 1 1/4-inch-thick filet 
mignons cost a hefty $49.95, plus $6.50 shipping charges (that's about $14 a 
steak). Boneless nine-ounce strip sirloins are four for $52. Four 10-ounce 
London broils cost $43. But if you have the slightest complaint, the company 
will gladly replace the steaks or refund your money. It's a lot like getting 
married is supposed to be. You get perfect devotion and unswerving commitment, 
and Omaha Steaks has you on its mailing list for life. Omaha Steaks

THE OTHER DARK MEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you've plucked all the possible chicken recipes from your repertoire and 
the holiday menu is still too recent to warrant another go-around with ham or 
turkey, serve duck. 
</P>
<P>
 It's rich, meaty, easy to fix and is a luxurious change from the usual meat or 
poultry dinner. Perhaps you've had thinly sliced duck breast in your favorite 
restaurant. It was grilled until pink in the center and dressed with a wine or 
cream sauce, and no doubt it was succulent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately this can be done at home now that meat processors are selling 
boneless duck breast to supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 When cooking duck breast, you have to render the fat first; otherwise the duck 
skin will splatter too much fat in the broiler. Once that's done, duck cooks 
quickly. Five minutes under the broiler should do it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recipe that follows, you can stop at any point and have a delicious 
duck dinner. For example, you can have plain broiled duck breast, or go to the 
next step and have duck breast in a marvelous mushroom, Scotch and cream sauce, 
or take the recipe to its final point and serve the mixture over pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 SCOTCH-FLAVORED DUCK AND MUSHROOMS OVER SPAGHETTI 
</P>
<P>
 1 boneless duck breast, cut into halves 
</P>
<P>
 2 shallots 
</P>
<P>
 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon Scotch whisky 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon crushed, dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound spaghetti, cooked and drained 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 With sharp knife score duck skin in diamond pattern. Be careful not to cut 
through to flesh. Place duck, skin-side-down, in heavy skillet and cook over 
medium-high heat to render fat, about 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Place duck on broiler pan, skin-side-down, and broil about 5 inches from heat 
until nicely browned outside and pink inside, about 5 minutes. Set aside until 
cool enough to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, mince shallots. Remove and discard mushroom stems and slice caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in large skillet. Add shallots and mushrooms and saute until 
mushrooms are golden, about 5 minutes. Add Scotch and cook 1 minute. Mixture 
will sizzle. Stir in thyme and chicken broth and simmer 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove and discard duck skin. Slice duck breast meat across grain into 
1/4-inch-thick slices. Add 1/4 cup cream to skillet and cook over high heat 
until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add duck and heat through. Stir 
spaghetti into duck and sauce. If necessary, heat through 5 minutes. Stir in 
remaining 2 tablespoons cream. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. 
Serve immediately. Makes 2 servings.

GOOD COOKING; SHAKING UP STIR-FRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stir-frying has a lot going for it. Not only is everything cooked quickly in a 
very little bit of oil over very high heat, but most recipes also use a high 
proportion of vegetables and noodles to meat. 
</P>
<P>
 In this recipe, an American inspiration, noodles with turkey, water chestnuts 
and cilantro are stir-fried and tossed in a slightly sweet, hoisin-based sauce 
-- much like that served with familiar moo shu pork and pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the broccoli and carrots in sesame oil and the Indian-style 
spinach and red onions could easily be served on the same plate -- even as a 
second course following the noodle appetizer. The flavors are quite different 
but compatible. Also, unlike most vegetable stir-fries, these vegetables are 
blanched first in boiling salted water to preserve their color. 
</P>
<P>
 MOO SHU-STYLE NOODLES WITH TURKEY, WATER CHESTNUTS AND CILANTRO 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup hoisin sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup reduced sodium chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons peanut oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 jalapeno chile, seeded if desired, minced 
</P>
<P>
 10 ounces ground turkey  
</P>
<P>
 10 small green onions, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound fettuccine, cooked (rinsed and tossed in few drops of oil, if cooked 
ahead) 
</P>
<P>
 1 (8-ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons minced cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 Combine hoisin sauce, chicken broth and vinegar in small bowl. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in wok or 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add minced 
jalapeno, turkey, 1/2 green onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir-fry until turkey 
is fully cooked, about 3 minutes. Add remaining green onions, fettuccine and 
water chestnuts along with reserved sauce. Toss to combine well. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat through, gently tossing noodles until very hot, about 3 minutes. Adjust 
seasonings to taste. Add cilantro and mix well. Serve immediately. Makes 3

 Central Palms is that part of Los Angeles sometimes called the entry-level 
Westside, a congeries of sleepy streets that is home to dance companies, and 
inexpensive ethnic restaurants, and low-rise apartment blocks that house what 
seems like half the recent graduates of UCLA. Though much of Palms was rebuilt 
in the waning days of the '80s real-estate boom, parts near the core still have 
the dusty small-town feel, the tall old-growth trees, of the time when this 
neighborhood was more or less countryside.

 Indo Cafe is a tidy storefront restaurant in that part of the Palms district 
where the main streets twist in the most confusing way; it's next door to a 
Mexican joint that specializes in "Pregnant Burritos" and a toss of a betel nut 
from a decent pizza place, a bohemian-gourmet cafe, a rathskeller and the 
best-known Sichuan restaurant in this part of town.  
</P>
<P>
 It's soothing in the Indo Cafe, all gleaming surfaces and neatly mounted 
photographs of Indonesian village life, folded linen napkins, bright Indonesian 
plates and full-course $7.95 dinner specials. The Indonesian cooking, sort of 
an intelligently gentrified, Muslim-accented greatest-hits version of 
pan-Indonesian cuisine, is hands down the best on the entire Westside, even if 
it may be modified a little too much to the Western taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayam balado , for example, a crisply fried chicken dish from the north coast 
of Sumatra, is served here under a mildly spiced red bell pepper puree where 
its traditional garnish is a blistering-hot puree of hot peppers; here dengdeng 
balado , a dish in which dried beef is often frizzled to something resembling a 
Pringle, is chewy and pleasant. Fried whole fish is seasoned with enough 
fermented shrimp paste to set off the flavor of the flesh, yet not enough to 
startle. The sayur lodeh , cabbage and long beans and such cooked down in 
turmeric-stained coconut milk, is as gentle a vegetable curry as you'll find. 
Indo Cafe is a user-friendly restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamarind soup is hotly spiced, tart and luscious, filled with bits of squash, 
Chinese long beans, and sliced corn cobs, an intricate bowl of broth; mellow 
Javanese-style chicken soup is slightly soured with lemon grass, thick with 
slippery glass noodles, garnished with handfuls of musky-tasting toasted 
betel-nut chips. Martabak telur , a scramble of meat, eggs and herbs folded 
into something like filo dough and fried, is a terrific sort of Indonesian 
borek , an exotically spiced version of something you'd expect to find at a 
North African restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Indo Cafe may be the only Southland restaurant to serve the fried, stuffed 
mashed-potato fritter called perkedel , crisp-edged and fine, that is pretty 
good on its own, but which almost explodes with flavor when you daub it with a 
bit of one of Indo Cafe's fiery chile condiments: the standard chile-hot sambal 
olek , plus a dusky, pungent sambal made with fermented shrimp and an unusual 
sambal scented with rose water. The beef-stuffed squid dish cumi isi is 
powerfully seasoned with the fermented shrimp paste but is still oddly 
compelling. Occasionally there is coconut-rich yellow rice, like an Indian 
biriani , topped with perkedel , a piece of the chile-fried chicken and a chunk 
of the coconut-stewed beef rendang : a delicious plate of food. The similar 
nasi rames combination plate over regular rice is pretty good too. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the sauteed bakmi noodles are sometimes bland, the gado-gado salad 
oversauced, Indo Cafe, like Kuala Lumpur, is one of those few Western-oriented 
Asian restaurants that manages to be accessible and still deliver the goods.

<P>
 DEAR JEAN: Do what we do: Make potato knishes, sweet potato pie and shepherd's 
pie. Here's a recipe for potato knishes from reader Jeanette Zimmerman, who 
says she freezes the unbaked knishes in small packages to bake as needed. The 
recipe for shepherd's pie also provides an opportunity to use any leftover 
cooked beef, lamb or poultry.

RIOJA; FOOD FROM THE SPANISH WINE COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One fall night, some three or four hours behind schedule, I drove through hard 
rain and thickening darkness up a hill behind the town of Labastida, a few 
miles from Haro in the northeastern end of Spain's famed Rioja wine district. 
My goal was the estate known officially as la Granja Nuestra Senora de 
Remelluri, the Farm of Our Lady of Remelluri -- producers of the excellent wine 
called simply Remelluri -- where I was to have dinner and spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, I turned through a low stone gate and rattled up a rutted, 
gravel-strewn dirt road, curving through low hills covered with ghostly black 
clumps of vines, until I came into a large yard with a long winery building at 
one end and the Remelluri manor house straight ahead. I banged on the ancient 
wooden door. It opened, and there stood Amaya Rodriguez, who runs the estate 
with her brother Telmo (he as winemaker, she as director of sales and 
marketing). "Welcome!" she exclaimed. "We were starting to get worried about 
you!" 
</P>
<P>
 In I was led, through a warmly lit foyer casually furnished with antique 
tables, dried flowers and a few pieces of old pottery, and then directly into a 
large, extended kitchen. To the far right was an arrangement of modern 
appliances, complete with microwave. In the middle stood a long, irregularly 
finished oaken table, with chairs on one side and a long bench on the other. 
Behind the bench was a high, narrow table laden with bottles of wine, cheeses, 
a basket of nuts, a bowl of fresh fruit. On the left side of the room, behind 
the chairs, was a huge brick fireplace, roaring out a welcome of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, I was warm and dry, sipping the vino de la casa with my back 
to the fire, nibbling olives and slices of homemade sausage. I felt like a 
wayfarer saved from the road and taken in and catered to by some legendary 
abbey or inn. This was the first time I had met the Rodriguezes, but 
immediately I felt signal hospitality of the most honest, earnest and sensible 
sort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the rain abated a bit later, I went off to the winery to taste barrel 
samples with Telmo. Remelluri is one of the newest wine producers in Rioja, and 
one of the area's few family-owned concerns. Although the winery is recent, the 
property itself, high in the hills of the region known as La Rioja Alavesa 
(officially part of the Basque country), is ancient. The name Remelluri 
commemorates a 10th-Century Alavesan count named Erramel, who once lived on 
that spot; uri is a Basque word meaning villa. Later, the estate belonged to 
the monastery of Tolono, whose remains can still be glimpsed on the crest of 
the hill behind the property. Amaya's and Telmo's father, a successful property 
developer who specialized in golf courses, bought the heart of the place in the 
early 1960s, then purchased as many as 50 tiny parcels of land around it. The 
estate now covers 222 acres, 148 of them planted to vines. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Remelluri vintage was 1971, and from the start the estate earned a 
good reputation. Since Telmo took over winemaking duties in 1990, though, the 
wine has progressed from good to extraordinary: rich, superbly balanced, deeply 
flavorful -- a wine few other Rioja producers, frankly, are making anymore. 
(Telmo's first vintage, the 1990, has just been released.) 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the house with Telmo after an hour or so of dipping into barrels, 
I sat down with the family for a perfect dinner of baby lamb cutlets grilled in 
the fireplace, salad, great bread from the local bakery, and then cheese and 
fruit, accompanied by an assortment of older Remelluri vintages. I slept 
upstairs in a room whose walls were slightly discolored by honey seeping 
through the adobe from a beehive outside one window. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya and Telmo invited me to come back to Remelluri the next time I was in 
Rioja, and I made plans to do so last June. But this time, I asked, would they 
consider sharing some of the secrets of their hospitality with me -- sharing, 
at least, some of the family recipes? Amaya replied that they would be 
delighted to do so, and with Victoria Martinez, the longtime family cook, she 
worked out a menu of traditional Riojan dishes and house specialties and 
invited me to haunt the kitchen as they were prepared. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The cooking of Rioja is nowhere near as complex as that of Catalonia, the 
Balearic Islands or the coastal Basque country. It is based on lamb, an array 
of sausages, game birds (in season) and above all a wealth of vegetables -- 
most notably the region's famous sweet red peppers, which seem to figure in 
nearly every Riojan dish, in either fresh or dried form. Garlic and onions are 
common flavoring elements, but herbs are used comparatively sparingly, though 
they grow all over these hills in fragrant profusion. Above all, it is simple 
cooking, sometimes time-consuming but not technically demanding -- the kind of 
satisfying, easy food that makes guests feel welcome and leaves them feeling 
well fed, no matter what the weather or the time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is considered one of the most prestigious dishes in Riojan cooking," 
says Amaya Rodriguez. The exact composition varies seasonally, of course; at 
Remelluri, most of the ingredients are harvested from the garden shortly before 
cooking. (One unusual ingredient may be stalks of borage or borraja, 
particularly prized for its delicate flavor.) The vegetables, in this as in 
other dishes from the region, are vastly overcooked by contemporary standards 
(Victoria Martinez cooks them even longer than specified below) -- but the 
finished product is nonetheless very flavorful.  
</P>
<P>
 RIOJAN VEGETABLE CASSEROLE (Menestra de Verdures) 
</P>
<P>
 4 pounds assorted fresh vegetables, at least 6 kinds, such as shelled peas, 
shelled fava beans (still in skins, but scored across middle, tops trimmed), 
small artichoke hearts (trimmed, cut in half lengthwise), 10 to 12 ribs Swiss 
chard (leafy part trimmed and reserved for another purpose), trimmed green 
beans, peeled and trimmed asparagus, yellow squash (peeled and cut into pieces 
about 1x2 inches), cauliflower florets, small lettuce hearts, carrot sticks, 
borage stalks (peeled and cut into 2- to 3-inch lengths) 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 onion, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound fresh brown mushrooms, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
 Bring 3 or 4 pots of water to boil and cook each variety of vegetable 
separately at low boil about 1 hour, except for lettuce hearts and borage 
stalks, which should cook only about 20 minutes. (If using artichoke hearts, 
add flesh, not peel, of 1/2 lemon to water when cooking.) As each batch is 
done, remove from water with slotted spoon and drain in colander, reusing same 
water for next vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
 When vegetables have drained, arrange in 2 1/2-quart heavy-bottomed glass or 
earthenware casserole dish, setting aside several pieces each of artichoke 
heart, Swiss chard stalk, asparagus, cauliflower and/or borage. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 minutes before last vegetables are done, coat medium skillet with 
olive oil and heat. Add onion, garlic and mushrooms and cook over high heat, 
stirring frequently, 8 minutes. Add enough water to barely cover ingredients 
and cook about 5 minutes more. 
</P>
<P>
 When all vegetables (except those reserved) have been arranged in casserole 
dish, pour mushroom mixture evenly over top and fill dish with water so that 
vegetables are about 2/3 covered. Season to taste with salt. Then place 
casserole dish over high heat on top of stove (use 2 burners if dish is oval in 
shape) and allow to cook, without stirring, about 20 minutes. Add more water if 
necessary, but finished dish shouldn't be very liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 While casserole is cooking, heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Roll 
reserved vegetable pieces in flour lightly seasoned to taste with salt and 
pepper. Then dip in beaten egg and fry in small batches until golden-brown. 
Carefully arrange fried vegetables on top of casserole and continue cooking 
until done. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>

 Victoria Martinez says that she has no special name for this dish "because I 
only cook beans this one way." She cautions that it is impossible to give an 
exact cooking time for beans unless you know how old they are; the younger ones 
cook more quickly. (Since she cooks only beans from Remelluri's own garden, she 
always knows their age.) The chile she uses is known as choricero; her chorizo 
sausage, for which there is no real substitute, is a Spanish sausage, short and 
stubby, about the length of a thumb, not the heavily spiced Mexican chorizo. It 
is available at La Espanola in Lomita and some other Latin delicatessens.  
</P>
<P>
 WHITE BEANS WITH CHORIZO (Alubias Blancas, 
</P>
<P>
 Estilo Victoria) 
</P>
<P>
 1 onion  
</P>
<P>
 1 pound dried white beans, preferably Spanish or Italian 
</P>
<P>
 1 leek, white part only 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
 1 tomato, peeled and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 sprig parsley  
</P>
<P>
 2 large dried mild red chiles, stemmed and seeded, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 Spanish chorizo sausages, each cut into 3 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon mild paprika 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon spicy paprika 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Cut onion in half. Chop 1/2 finely, leave other 1/2 whole. 
</P>
<P>
 In pot soak beans in plenty of water 3 to 4 hours. Then place in larger pot 
and add about 3 times their volume of water. Cover and bring to boil over low 
heat, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Uncover, add unchopped 1/2 onion piece, leek, 
garlic, tomato and parsley. Continue cooking, uncovered, until beans are tender 
but not overdone, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 minutes before beans are done, add chiles and sausages. Remove 1/2 
onion, leek, garlic cloves and parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 When beans are almost done cooking, place olive oil in small skillet over high 
heat. Fry chopped 1/2 onion about 5 minutes. Stir in mild and spicy paprikas, 
then add mixture to beans, stirring well. Season to taste with salt. 
</P>
<P>
 When serving, make sure that each portion contains 1 piece of sausage. Makes 4 
servings.

 Chicharro is a variety of fish known in English as horse-mackerel, generally 
not very highly regarded for its flavor. In northwestern Spain and Portugal, 
though, it can be quite good. Any kind of mackerel or other reasonably oily 
bluefish can be substituted.  
</P>
<P>
 RIOJAN-STYLE GRILLED MACKEREL WITH GARLIC SAUCE (Chicharro a la Brasa) 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 6 mackerels, each about 3/4 pound, cleaned 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped  
</P>
<P>
 2 large mild dried chiles, stemmed and seeded, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Juice 2 lemons 
</P>
<P>
 Salt fish generously to taste inside and outside. Grill over hot fire, turning 
once, until cooked through but not overdone, 10 to 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, heat oil over high heat in skillet. Fry garlic and chiles until 
brown. Stir in lemon juice and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer. Remove fish from 
fire and place on plates or platter. Spoon sauce over. Makes 4 servings.

 Lamb is the meat of choice in Rioja. Beef and veal are rarely found, and pork 
is consumed almost entirely in the form of ham or sausages. Though the most 
common preparation of lamb in the region is asado or roasted, this braised 
version is also quite popular.  
</P>
<P>
 RIOJAN-STYLE BRAISED LAMB IN ALMOND SAUCE (Cordero Con Salsa de Almendros) 
</P>
<P>
 8 to 10 peeled almonds 
</P>
<P>
 1 onion, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 onion, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 pounds young lamb, bone in, cut into 8 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 carrots, peeled and cut into slices about 1/2-inch thick 
</P>
<P>
 6 ribs Swiss chard, cut into 1 1/2-inch lengths, leafy part trimmed and 
reserved 
</P>
<P>
 Mash almonds with mortar and pestle, adding few drops water to form rough 
paste.  
</P>
<P>
 Fry finely chopped onion and garlic in olive oil in medium-sized, deep skillet 
until lightly browned. Add lamb and fry, turning to brown on all sides. Cover 
pan, reduce heat to medium and cook 1 hour. Add mashed almonds. Season to taste 
with salt. Replace cover and continue cooking until lamb is very tender, about 
30 minutes longer, adding small quantity of water if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 minutes before lamb is done, saute coarsely chopped onion, carrots 
and Swiss chard in oil until tender. Season to taste with salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Place 2 pieces lamb on each plate and spoon reduced almond sauce over. Spoon 
vegetables around meat. Makes 4 servings.

 Some years ago, says Victoria Martinez, she saw a recipe for sliced oranges 
with candied orange peel in Hola! magazine. One day it occurred to her to 
combine that idea with a traditional Spanish dessert of pears poached in red 
wine. The Rodriguez family serves the resulting creation throughout the summer. 
 
</P>
<P>
 ORANGE AND PEAR SALAD (Postre de la Casa) 
</P>
<P>
 4 large navel oranges 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 4 large pears 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 bottle red Rioja wine 
</P>
<P>
 1 stick cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 Zest 1/2 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 10 ounces walnut pieces 
</P>
<P>
 10 ounces large raisins 
</P>
<P>
 Peel oranges, then cut zest of 1 orange into very thin strips, about 2 1/2 
inches long. Slice oranges and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Place shredded orange zest in small saucepan with water to cover and add about 
2 tablespoons sugar. Bring to boil, then reduce heat and cook very slowly until 
liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, peel pears and cut each across middle, about 1 inch from bottom, to 
form 2 pieces from each pear -- 1 flat, round disk and 1 bell-shaped piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Place pears in large sauce pan with wine, cinnamon, lemon zest and about 1 cup 
sugar. Bring to boil, cover and simmer until pears are tender, about 20 
minutes. Uncover and simmer until only thick syrup remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange pears in middle of platter or wide, shallow bowl, then arrange orange 
slices around. Scatter oranges and pears with candied orange zest, walnut 
pieces and raisins. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>

IN THE KITCHEN; POLENTA: A STIRRING TALE

<P>
 There is something about polenta that brings out the traditionalist in a lot 
of us. 
</P>
<P>
 I once cooked dinner with a wonderful woman named Giuliana Giacosa-Pionzo at 
her bed-and-breakfast on a hill just above the Italian town of Alba, 
approximately midway between the wine regions of Barolo and Barbaresco. Signora 
Pionzo's B & B, which cost something like $45 per person, was luxuriously 
finished, befitting the wife of a prominent physician. For an extra charge (as 
I remember, more than the room itself), she would fix dinner for you, with most 
of the ingredients coming from her property. 
</P>
<P>
 In her kitchen, she had all the modern conveniences -- electric range, 
dishwasher, freezer and refrigerator. And she had a wood-burning stove. She 
kept it, she said, because "I can't imagine making polenta on anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Polenta is a deeply flavored, completely delicious sponge that is unmatched 
for sopping up juices from, say, stews or roast meats. In this sense, you could 
call it the Italian equivalent of mashed potatoes. But make it the 
old-fashioned way once, and you'll understand why those little Italian 
grandmas, under their black dresses, have shoulders like NFL linebackers.  
</P>
<P>
 Technically, making polenta is no challenge. And as far as ingredients are 
concerned, nothing could be simpler -- there are only three: cornmeal, water 
and salt. It's the combining of them that is a pain. Imagine stirring tar for 
an hour continuously (no time off for good behavior) and you get a pretty fair 
picture of what I'm talking about. It's weary work and if you're not careful 
(or if you're just wimpy), you can wind up with a nice blister on your stirring 
hand. Mine is recovering nicely, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In restaurants, it's a pretty sure bet that the only types of polenta you'll 
see are those fried or broiled polenta tiles. They're made from cooled and 
sliced fresh polenta and they look nice on a designer plate. They are also much 
more forgiving of quick preparation and can be made in advance and quickly 
finished at the last minute. I made fried polenta both from regular cornmeal 
and from instant polenta mix and I couldn't tell the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh polenta is another story. It's a funny thing, but when foods are this 
simple in concept, they frequently have what food writer Matt Kramer calls 
"taste transparency." Take a bite and you immediately can tell what has gone 
into the dish -- and if any shortcuts were taken. Polenta is that way. Taste a 
sample freshly made from an instant mix and then one made from regular 
cornmeal. There's no convincing yourself they're the same thing, no matter how 
sore your stirring arm is. I know. I tried. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I went beyond that. Various cookbook writers have come up with 
shortcuts to try to take the sting out of the preparation. I took two that 
seemed promising and made them alongside the regular and instant. And if you 
don't think juggling four burners of polenta is fun . . .  
</P>
<P>
 First, the regular. Into 6 1/2 cups of boiling salted water, stir 2 cups of 
yellow cornmeal (some cookbooks insist on organically grown, stone-ground, but 
I used regular commercial, albeit from a store where cornmeal turns over very 
quickly and it was fine -- I think freshness is the key factor). Use a whisk 
for this part of the job; it's most important that no lumps form. If they do, 
you can try to work them out by mashing them against the side of the pan with a 
wooden spoon, but this is, at best, an imperfect solution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, we're told to add the cornmeal by the fistful, letting it 
trickle between almost closed fingers to prevent it from being added too 
quickly. I found this a pain. It worked better for me to shake it straight from 
a small bowl, being careful to add a little at a time, whisking madly all the 
while. It takes a little practice, but you'll work out a kind of push-pull 
rhythm -- sort of like rubbing your belly and patting your head at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 An article in a wonderful Italian food magazine, A Tavola, recommends adding 
three-fourths of the cornmeal first and then stirring for 15 minutes before 
adding the remainder. When you make it, you'll understand why. Three-fourths of 
the cornmeal is about what it takes to thicken the mush enough that it starts 
bubbling and spewing like some golden volcano. Watch it: Those spitting polenta 
gobs are hot. It's not called Italian napalm for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Once all the cornmeal has been added, turn the heat to medium-low and stir 
with a wooden spoon. And stir. And stir. For about an hour. The polenta is done 
when it pulls cleanly away from the sides and bottom of the pan. In "La Cucina 
di Lidia," noted Italian chef Lidia Bastianich recommends a cooking time of 
only 30 minutes to 35 minutes. I tasted it at that point, and neither the 
flavor nor the texture were quite right, though certainly each type of cornmeal 
will cook differently. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortcuts came from two good sources. Marcella Hazan, a traditionalist if 
ever there was one, offers a labor-saving wrinkle on the basic technique in her 
"Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking": Once the cornmeal has been well 
stirred into the pot, cover tightly and then stir just one minute every 10 
minutes. In her "The Splendid Table," Lynne Kasper offers a more drastic 
alternative. She recommends adding boiling water to the cornmeal, sealing it 
tight and then cooking in a double boiler, stirring only four or five times. 
(This, I learned later, is itself a variation on a quick method developed by 
San Francisco restaurateur Carlo Middione, though in his version, the polenta 
is added in the traditional way and cooked for five minutes over direct heat 
before being covered and placed over a double-boiler.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When each version was completed, I added a couple of tablespoons of butter and 
grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and beat them in until the mush was smooth. Then I 
tasted. 
</P>
<P>
 Polenta "Original Recipe" was sticky and thick, about the texture of cream 
whipped to stiff peaks, and had a rich corn taste with a slightly bitter edge 
that was a perfect match for the cheese and butter. It was truly spectacular. 
In fact, I had to taste quite a bit before I could believe how good it really 
was. I kept hoping it was a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the shortcuts, Hazan's was the best. It was slightly looser and smoother in 
texture, more like cream whipped to soft peaks. The flavor was not as deep or 
developed as the first, but it was very close. Kasper's came in just ahead of 
the instant. The texture was fine -- closer to the original than Hazan's -- but 
the flavor was light and undeveloped. It was a far cry from the original. 
</P>
<P>
 Why this is so, I can't say, though it could have something to do with the 
cornmeal toasting a bit directly over the flame but not over the softer heat of 
a double boiler. If this theory is right, you should be able to improve the 
flavor by following Middione's method. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly enough, an hour later, when all four had cooled significantly, 
the flavor differences had diminished greatly. And as great as the difference 
in texture had been between the original and Hazan's shortcut, after cooling 
they were indistinguishable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once cooled and sliced, polenta can be broiled or fried, as described above, 
or it can be layered with cheese and sauce and, if you want, other ingredients 
for strata -- a kind of polenta lasagna. 
</P>
<P>
 As for hot polenta, the A Tavola article lists 25 versions -- everything from 
polenta e latte (cooked in milk and sweetened with sugar and cinnamon) to suf 
(cooked in milk with butter added), including intruglia (a soupy polenta with 
beans and black cabbage added) and the delightfully named smacafam (a little 
savory cake made with special Grano Saraceno cornmeal and sausages). One night 
I mixed hot polenta, shredded blue cheese and chopped cooked broccoli to a good 
effect. There are also variations made with white cornmeal, though these are 
usually sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The use of instant polenta in this recipe, from Carol Fields' "Italy in Small 
Bites," is strictly optional. If you prefer, make it the traditional way, as 
described above. Just be sure to warm up your stirring arm in advance.

WINE: PHELPS: A WINERY MAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six years ago, winemaker Craig Williams faced up to a series of dilemmas that 
had left his Joseph Phelps Winery just another good Napa Valley winery without 
much of an identity -- and with a list of wines longer than any other major 
premium winery. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps made Chardonnays that were soft and awkward, lacking focus. The Napa 
Valley Zinfandel was good, but the Sonoma County Zinfandel, made from purchased 
grapes, was even better. The flagship Cabernet Sauvignon was hard and 
astringent and rife with curious aromas. The Riesling was soft and appealing, 
but how many people buy Riesling? Put simply, Phelps made too many wines in too 
many styles, including a number of red wines from Rhone grapes that were so 
erratic that from year to year no one could predict what they'd be like. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, after taking steps to solve problems in the winery and vineyard, and 
after making major changes in production, the Phelps winery stands on the 
threshold of a new era. The current wines are better than ever, and the 
soon-to-be-released wines are even more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Even two years ago, no one would have put money on this turnaround occurring, 
not with some of the odd wines Phelps had made. Moreover, with the long list of 
wines Williams was asked to make, there was little time for experimentation to 
make the necessary improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 This hurt the image of the Phelps winery, which was founded in 1973, when Joe 
Phelps bought a 200-acre parcel of land off the Silverado Trail. The winery 
immediately made headlines for its fine wines; in the 1970s and 1980s, the 
image of the winery was high. But in the last few years it has declined. In 
fact, a Los Angeles-area merchant once told me, "No one has come in and asked 
for a Phelps wine in two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Williams, who inherited the head winemaker position from Walter Schug a 
decade ago, admits he's been through a transformation. He has trimmed the line 
of wines to a manageable number -- though it is still larger than most fine 
wineries -- and he has begun to focus on bringing more character to the 
remaining wines by making huge changes in production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It started with changes we made in the vineyard," says Williams. Too much 
grape production from some vineyards was leaving the wines hollow, so he 
planted test blocks of grapes on special "devigorating" rootstocks, which cut 
grape production by as much as 25%. He found that better wine resulted, so by 
1988, he was tearing out older vines and planting more and more of Phelps' 
acreage with roots that gave a smaller but better-quality crop. It was 
expensive, but it would pay dividends down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Another step was identifying that a few of Phelps' red wines, including the 
vaunted Insignia, a Cabernet-based blend, had a problem called brettanomyces. 
The horsey/leathery aroma in the wine was liked by some, but Williams knew it 
was like a ticking time bomb. He also knew that getting rid of "brett" wasn't 
easy and would be expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 But winery owner Joe Phelps, a successful contractor from Denver, is in this 
game not so much for profit as to make great wine. He agreed to the rigorous 
cleanup campaign. It required the mass discarding of expensive French oak 
barrels and the implementation of a rigid cleanliness program to make sure the 
wines were protected from any form of spoilage. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps also bought new equipment -- a gentler crushing machine and a device 
that chills grape juice before fermentation -- leading to better control over 
the wine. Williams and assistants Gary Brookman, Lisa Bishop and Damian Parker 
began to crush fewer tons of grapes per day. "We got rid of the panic days of 
harvest," says Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Winemaking changed too. There was less handling and processing of grapes and 
juice. Williams stopped adding sulfur dioxide to the grapes at a stage where 
once it had been considered mandatory. He stopped adding acid to the wine and 
instead altered picking dates to ensure that the wine would have enough acid 
off the vine. He kept press wine separate from "free run" juice and used it 
sparingly in final blends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also solved the Syrah riddle that had plagued the winery for 15 years. Joe 
Phelps loves the variety, as he does all the red wines of the Rhone Valley. He 
has made Syrah since 1974, but some were strange and aged poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, Williams says, the source of grapes changed often, from 
western valley floor to eastern valley floor to foothills. Only in the last 
four years has Williams found the grapes to make the best Syrah. Today Phelps' 
"Vin du Mistral" wine, called "Le Mistral," is a sublime example of a 
California/Rhone red with style, fruit, power and grace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What follows are tasting notes of wines that carry the Phelps name; a few also 
carry the Rhone-ish brand name of Vin du Mistral: 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Vin du Mistral Viognier ($25) -- An intriguing aroma of flower blossoms 
and peaches, hints of nutmeg and cardamom, and a creamy finish. I feel this is 
the best Viognier in California. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Chardonnay, "Los Carneros" ($16.50) -- Hints of toast, citrus and pine; a 
roasted nut character in the taste with broad, buttery notes. Not as crisp as I 
prefer, but well made. This is the first Phelps' Chardonnay from grapes 
entirely from the cool Carneros region, and it is better than past Phelps 
Chardonnays. (To be released in a few weeks.) 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Vin du Mistral Grenache Rose ($9) -- Spectacular strawberry and orange 
peel aroma with rich taste and rewarding depth. Really a red wine in some ways, 
but with white wine texture -- a most serious rose. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Vin du Mistral Grenache ($9) -- Similar to the above wine, but with more 
depth, color and intensity. A pomegranate-like aroma, with a dash of black 
pepper, fairly light in the mouth. The wine doesn't need as much chilling as 
the rose. It offers Chateauneuf-du-Pape sort of character with the weight of a 
Beaujolais.  
</P>
<P>
 1991 Vin du Mistral "Le Mistral" ($15) -- Similar to a Cotes du Rhone, with 
nuances of anise and roasted green peppers with a leafy aftertaste. Far 
superior to past vintages, with enough oak to let you know it's there, not 
enough to rob the wine of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Merlot, Napa Valley ($14) -- With spiced herbs, cherries and a trace of 
earth, this wine has a weight that is appealing. Despite a big, chewy 
mid-palate, it ends with a graceful finish. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley ($17.50) -- Vanilla/chocolate notes over 
a solid core of perfectly ripe (not overripe) black cherry fruit and spice. A 
marvelously scented and flavored wine with a lean finish. Should age well, but 
already is tasty. Superb wine. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon, "Backus Vineyard" ($32) -- Mint and a slight 
menthol-like note combine with black cherry, cassis and a roasted oak component 
to reward lovers of big-style Cabernets. This version of the Backus (always in 
demand by collectors) is better than in the past because of a more claret-like 
aftertaste. Powerful and graceful all at once. 
</P>
<P>
 1989 "Insignia" ($35) -- Very rich, ripe, minty kinds of aromas with loads of 
black cherry and oak/earth tones in the finish. A round, rich and powerful wine 
that will reward long cellaring. Phelps' Insignia was one of the first 
Meritage-type wines when it appeared in 1974. After a few awkward vintages, it 
is back to being great. Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Farnese ($6.50) : Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, which 
takes its name from a grape native to Abruzzi, in central Italy, is often 
confused with the Tuscan wine Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, which is made from 
a different grape (Sangiovese) in a place called Montepulciano. The 
Montepulciano grape makes a lighter, less rich red wine than a Sangiovese and 
requires less aging. In fact, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, typically not aged in 
oak barrels, is best consumed young. 
</P>
<P>
 This wine was specially bottled for Lorenzo Scarpone, owner of Villa Italia 
Gourmet Foods and Wines of South San Francisco by a cooperative that has its 
own vineyards. "I didn't want something full-bodied," he says, "even though I 
know a lot of people like full-bodied wine. I want to have something that's 
easy to drink with the pasta, even with seafood pasta, which is very popular 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 The wine, which was not aged in oak, is delicious, with ripe, faint 
strawberry-like fruit and a lush and fairly rich taste. It works well with a 
wide variety of dishes even though it finishes typically tart. A few discount 
shops will have the wine for less than this list price. If you're upset at the 
escalating prices of Chianti ($12 for simple Chianti), this is one excellent 
alternative.

 Kids, never look a gift UFO in the mouth: Two L.A. police officers paid a 
surprise visit to an Atwater-area elementary school just before Christmas to 
hand out some toys -- illuminated, beeping tops that resemble something E.T. 
might fly home in. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Ray Yzguerra and Manuel Argomaniz later received some candid reviews 
of the playthings (and their sound effects) from the kids at Delevan Drive 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Rommel Dimacali, for example, wrote that he made the mistake of allowing his 
brother to touch the toy (see letter). 
</P>
<P>
 Other reviews: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Thank you for the UFO top. I had lots of fun with it. The first time I 
tried it my mom thought it was a test on TV." (Mark Gonzalez) 
</P>
<P>
 * "I am still playing with it. My mom thought the birds were whistling when it 
is still nighttime." (Bogart Corpus) 
</P>
<P>
 * "I rather return it and get one with volume because my mom and dad say it's 
too loud. Anyway, Happy New Year." (Nick Prieto)

 This score just in: John Hendry of Van Nuys points out that USC fans can take 
comfort in the fact that the Trojans did play on New Year's Day, if not in the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Metropolitan Opera Broadcast featured Berlioz's "Les Troyens" ("The 
Trojans") that day. Hendry couldn't resist adding: "The Trojans lost in the 
opera -- just as they might have done to Wisconsin."

 The amazing colossal error: We recently mentioned that a KTLA (Channel 5) 
special on newsman Stan Chambers revealed that he had a bit part as a reporter 
in a '50s monster movie set in Griffith Park. The program said the movie was 
"The Amazing Colossal Beast." We're amazed to learn it was the wrong title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your reference is sure to anger the tens, no, dozens, of Bert I. Gordon fans 
across the country," writes Wayne Tanner of Culver City, one of two Gordon fans 
who wrote us. "Gordon's 1957 opus was . . . 'The Amazing Colossal Man' and its 
climax took place not in Griffith Park, but in a cardboard approximation of Las 
Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie in which Chambers appeared, Tanner writes, was a sequel, "War of the 
Colossal Beast," in which "the 60-foot giant manages to escape from an airplane 
hangar at LAX and walk to Griffith Park without being seen by anybody (a neat 
trick that is never explained)."  
</P>
<P>
 We can explain it in one word: Smog. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An almost colossal coincidence: The "Colossal" movies, by the way, may begin 
popping up on television soon, now that they have become unexpectedly topical. 
After all, the title character is an Army officer who assumes gigantic 
proportions, according to one movie guide, after being "exposed to massive 
amounts of radiation." miscelLAny:

<P>
 Lee Estes and Christopher Starks of L.A. captured Roto Rooter's nationwide 
Monster Root Contest by laboring more than 14 hours to extract a 103-foot-long 
branch from a small drain near the World Trade Center. A press release adds: 
"The Gargantuan root is available for photo opportunities." We'd be especially 
interested if you persuaded the Colossal Man to pose with it.

A JOKE? JUST ASK THE STUDENTS; HIGHER-EDUCATION BUDGET HURTS AS WILSON FIGHTS 
FOR IMMIGRATION FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From fall of 1992 to fall of 1993, enrollment in California public higher 
education dropped by a whopping 159,000 students, including a decline of 
137,000 in the Community College system alone. 
</P>
<P>
 California's decline is not unique. The American Council on Education recently 
surveyed enrollment in 17 states and found an overall enrollment drop in 13; 10 
had experienced a decline at the community college level. But California's 
decline was unique in its severity: "No state reported losses close to 
California's," according to a report in the Chronicle of Higher Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this loss the result of high California tuition? In fact, California's 
tuition is on the low end in all three systems, particularly if the comparison 
is confined to states that offer education of comparable quality. But 
higher-tuition states always have barred many on the path to educational and 
economic advancement; California used to keep the path open to all. Now state 
budget cutbacks are pushing tuition up and obstructing some. Even if tuition is 
not high in absolute terms, the increase is pushing students out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholarship assistance is available for the lowest-income students. Hit 
hardest are the children of the working poor and the lower middle class, 
students with a family income of $20,000 to $35,000, reports Santa Monica 
College President Richard Moore. And not all of those who are hurt are 
18-year-olds just out of high school. Tuition in the Community College system 
has risen most sharply for degree holders back in school for retraining, an 
estimated 54,000 students, or half the overall loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can help them? Even if Washington begins meeting its obligation to the 
state for services to illegal immigrants, the difference won't be felt in 
California next year; however, the downward trend surely could be slowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's decision to build $2.6 billion in federal immigration money 
into his budget has been laughed at in Washington. But as Florida's proposed 
lawsuit proves, the states that are seeking immigration funding are not joking. 
Talk to an involuntary college dropout or two, and you'll know why.

SPECIAL COUNSEL -- HERE IT COMES; WHITEWATER HEAT RAGES AS WHITE HOUSE MOVES 
TOWARD OUTSIDE INVESTIGATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Politics does not always make for great public policy. The so-called 
Whitewater affair is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal would be: When Congress returns to work later this month, the House 
of Representatives quickly passes legislation renewing the now expired special 
prosecutor law, as the Senate already has done.Passage then allows Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno to ask a panel of judges to select a special, outside prosecutor to 
carry forth the probe, which she does. That takes the case away from the 
Clinton Justice Department -- and out of Reno's hands. Then the special 
prosecutor conducts an investigation of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
involvement in the Whitewater real estate project. Many months -- and surely 
millions of dollars -- later, the country, presumably, knows the answer to such 
questions as: Did the Clintons, when Bill Clinton was governor, improperly help 
an Arkansas co-investor and supporter who was in trouble with regulators over 
his failing savings and loan institution? 
</P>
<P>
 The White House denies that Clintons did anything wrong; no formal charges 
have been filed. A special prosecutor might find something, or nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the infamous Beltway this case has become a full-scale brouhaha, and so 
enter hardball politics and exit optimal public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Republican members of Congress -- joined of late by some Democrats -- 
have been insisting that Reno not wait for Congress to reauthorize the special 
prosecutor law but instead designate an outside superlawyer to launch an 
independent investigation now. Late Wednesday, that is what Reno, with the 
approval of the White House, said she will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely how having Reno pick the lawyer gets around the objection that her 
fingerprints would be on the operation is beyond us. But that is now a moot 
point. Just call it politics.

PUTTING CLOTHES ON THE EMPEROR; IS NATO FINALLY SERIOUS ABOUT SARAJEVO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Put up or shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, as a communique was being drafted that would commit NATO to attack 
Serb artillery emplacements from the air if the strangulation of Sarajevo 
continued, President Clinton spoke sternly: 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are going to reassert this warning (issued for the first time last 
August), it cannot be seen as mere rhetoric. Those who attack Sarajevo must 
understand we are serious. In voting for this language, I expect (NATO) to take 
action when necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the communique was ratified: NATO reaffirmed its readiness under the 
authority of the Security Council of the United Nations "to carry out air 
strikes in order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and 
other threatened areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs attacking Sarajevo responded to this new threat by immediately 
meeting the one non-procedural condition NATO had stipulated. They launched a 
mortar attack that shut down the Sarajevo airport, halting the airlift on which 
Sarajevo depends for food. This followed a week of intensified shelling of the 
airport and of densely populated central Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, Clinton must now -- immediately -- call for an emergency NATO 
summit and at it he must demand that the threatened air strikes be executed. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO has made the air strikes conditional on a unanimous vote of its 16 member 
states, thus giving Greece, a NATO member but a Serbian ally, a veto. NATO has 
also made the strikes conditional on approval by the Security Council, thus 
giving U.N. General Secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a past opponent of 
military assistance to the Bosnians, a veto. These escape clauses may exist 
because some NATO members, rather than take the necessary action, want only not 
to seem to be avoiding it. 
</P>
<P>
 But not Clinton. He has already attacked that very escapism: "Failure to act 
on promises of action," he said Monday, "will have great ramifications in the 
future in other contexts." In effect, Clinton has given his word that he will 
not allow the NATO promise to become a damagingly empty one. 
</P>
<P>
 Let him now be a man of his word and move NATO from talk to action. Greece may 
stop him. Boutros-Ghali, perhaps with the tacit backing of some of the NATO 
states, may stop him. But let Clinton not pusillanimously check beforehand to 
see whether his flag will be saluted before he raises it. He tried that once 
before, sending Secretary of State Warren Christopher on a European diplomatic 
mission that left NATO bewildered and Christopher humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come for the President to call several bluffs at once. If he does 
so, either Sarajevo will be en route to rescue or NATO will be exposed as a 
paper tiger. Either way, the sooner the better.

ELECTION-YEAR WATCH; GOOD TRY, BUT . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surprised by all the sudden bills in Sacramento dealing with the hot-button 
issue of illegal immigration? Hey, it's an election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) has authored one that would fine 
businesses with five or more workers as much as $2,000 for each illegal 
immigrant employed.A second offense could lead to forfeiture of a firm's 
assets, and later violations could carry prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 The political appeal is clear; the bill sailed through the Assembly's Public 
Safety Committee. However well-intentioned this legislation, there's a hitch: 
Immigration is such a huge issue that only the federal government can really 
handle it. Indeed, the problem isn't the law, it's enforcement. The 1986 
federal Immigration Reform and Control Act already imposes sanctions on 
employers that hire illegal immigrants. But weak federal enforcement has 
undermined the sanctions threat. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a state approach, previous "crackdowns" have not helped. That's why 
stepped-up federal enforcement would be better than new, duplicative state 
laws. There is also the question of how to pay for inspectors to enforce new 
laws. Umberg contends that assets seized from offending business owners would 
cover the cost. Not likely: After all, the Supreme Court has just curbed 
government's power to seize property in drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's bill rightly puts an onus on business to ensure that workers are 
properly documented. But the most effective way to deal with illegal 
immigration is through federal action.

REGULATIONS FOR VITAMINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Vitamin Makers Can Swallow New Rules," editorial, Jan. 4: 
</P>
<P>
 While I support the Food and Drug Administration's restrictions on the claims 
that can be made for dietary supplements, something needs to be done about the 
Catch-22 inherent in market-driven medicine. The bee-sting therapy you reported 
about (Jan. 4) is a classic example. It is scientifically unproven and will 
likely remain that way because scientific testing is almost always connected 
with intellectual property rights. If nobody can own it, then the private, 
for-profit medical system is unlikely to test it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time that we leap over the ideological barrier that keeps treatments in 
the public domain from undergoing the rigors of scientific testing. It's time 
to spend public funds to test what is most promising. We could support this 
effort through sales taxes on those that prove effective. Not only would the 
public health be improved, but by eliminating worthless treatments, there is 
potential to reduce what we spend on health care. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also worth noting that the same principles that should make us skeptical 
of health claims by sellers of food supplements suggest that we restructure the 
way drugs are tested. Relying on regulators to protect the public from the 
inherent conflict of interest in allowing corporations to test and monitor the 
safety and effectiveness of what they own is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA should create the standards and specifications and then put the 
testing out to bid to third parties without a stake in the outcome. This would 
also allow the public a window into the books of drug companies so when we grow 
into the reality of health care rationing, excess profits will be on the table 
with the really tough choices we need to make. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * There is more involved in the FDA's attempts to impose new restrictions on 
the vitamin industry than honesty in advertising. What is at stake is the 
freedom to disseminate nutritional and health-related information without 
interference from an arrogant and backward agency which is generally 20 to 40 
years behind in its knowledge of such matters. FDA Commissioner David Kessler 
and his cronies think that they should be the sole source of health-related 
information for the United States. The most likely result of increasing their 
control over the vitamin industry would be higher prices and lower quality.

 * In response to Harry Bernstein's Column Left, "It's a Fine Line Between 
Profit and Greed, " Jan. 2: 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later, all of the companies that boost profits by laying off workers 
will have to pay the piper.Laid-off employees have little or no discretionary 
income with which to purchase goods and services; without jobs, people cannot 
help keep businesses alive. The lack of the "little guy's" spending dollar will 
eventually sink all businesses, save the grocer and the funeral director. 
</P>
<P>
 This downward spiral ultimately hurts all, even businesses that feel 
temporarily immune. Employers should remember this.

 Taxation of Social Security benefits for some recipients will increase from 
50% to 85% after 1993. Taxes on the increase (35%) are deposited into the 
Medicare trust fund which, combined with the 1.45% Social Security tax (FICA), 
pays for hospital benefits under Medicare. Treatment of taxes resulting from 
the initial 50% will not change after 1993 -- these taxes will continue to be

WILSON'S STATE BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is a well-known fact that education is a major key to upward mobility. 
Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed budget, by forcing increased tuition at not only 
the community college level but also for the state's two university systems 
(Jan. 7), makes the road to higher education more difficult to travel. At the 
same time he proposed $2 billion for construction of new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 A year of incarceration is much more costly and certainly less beneficial than 
a year of higher education. It seems to me, Wilson has his priorities and 
cost/benefit analyses rather confused. By his logic of reward, crime pays 
better than education.

done more to undermine local law enforcement efforts than the public can 
imagine. However, contrary to the opinion of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco), his plan to imprison three-time losers for life has merit. 
Violent felons are predators and should be caged like any other predators for 
as long as possible. Barring that, perhaps they could all be paroled to Brown's 
district.

Then, when they finish their jail terms they will have a job and a stake in 
society.

HUNTING WOLVES IN ALASKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article on the Alaska wolf issue (Jan. 3) was well-documented and fair 
to both sides. I have lived in different parts of Alaska for 70 years and fully 
understand the problem. It is not only the hunters from Fairbanks but the 
natives from the villages who want the wolf population reduced in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 I would hope that Pricilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals, would go to 
some of the villages in this 4,000-square-mile area. These people live off the 
country -- moose, caribou and dried fish. There are no Safeways or even 
7-Eleven stores there. The basics come by air. Taking 100 wolves out of a 
population of 7,000 is not out of the question when it means food for those who 
subsist on fish and wildlife. 
</P>

 Man and wolf compete for the same meat and both need to be controlled.

<P>
 The wholesale slaughter of wolves in Alaska is deplorable not only in terms of 
needless killing of a magnificent breed of animal; the soul of collective 
mankind has slipped downward a few steps on the evolutionary ladder, as well. 
Be assured that a wolf would at least face us eye to eye were the positions 
reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 When we violate anyone, we crucify ourselves, we become our own victims. 
Haven't we practiced that phase of our development long enough?  
</P>
<P>
 We also have within our nature the power to behave peaceably with honor and 
respect toward our planet-mates, celebrating our differences rather than 
destroying them. And everything living, whether it walks on two legs, four, or 
none at all, has the right to that kind of behavior from each of us!

wolves that hunt caribou for survival so that there will be more caribou for 
the people who hunt them for sport is terribly cruel and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Assn. (an ironic name, to say 
the least!) says that it would be "fair" if of the harvestable surplus 
wildlife, hunters took 30%, bears 30%, wolves 30% and natural causes 10%. 
Perhaps the association could take a meeting with the bears and wolves to 
debate the issue. I'm sure they could get Mr. Ed to mediate. Oh, and somebody 
needs to let the other animals know that only 10% of them are allowed to die 
naturally.

 There, that was easy enough; now if we could only do lunch with the spotted

 On Feb. 11, 1945, my wife and I listened in London to the evening news as the 
signing of the Yalta agreement was announced. It solidified the wartime 
cooperation between three victorious major powers; they granted themselves the 
authority to carve out the new frontiers of Europe. Smaller and weaker allies, 
irrespective of their contributions to the joint war efforts, were sacrificed 
on the altar of big-powers unity.

foreign-imposed regime. Yet that decision was challenged by the political mood 
of the period. The government would be wise, pontificated the venerable Times 
of London, "to curb hostile voices of disgruntled Poles attacking their newly 
formed government." Three years later, when we went to the American consulate 
to collect our immigration visas, the consul inquired why we were not returning 
home. "Poland is free," he said, "it has a newly established government 
recognized by the Allies. You would risk nothing returning." And both 
Washington and London justified their policy as the only one acceptable to 
Moscow. It would be foolish to irritate the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Is history repeating itself? 
</P>
<P>
 We are witnessing a widespread discussion about the future of NATO and the 
split in the ranks of the State Department policy-makers. Apparently, stronger 
personalities and stronger presidential ties prevailed. Instead of responding 
to Eastern European calls for admission to the Western security umbrella, a 
watered-down formula called "Partnership for Peace" was offered. It would be 
foolish to irritate Russia and President Boris N. Yeltsin, the current darling 
of the American foreign-policy Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Is history repeating itself? Probably, but circumstances are dramatically 
different. Half a century ago, the big powers' decisions rested on the premises 
that the two halves of the continent -- Eastern and Western -- could remain 
separated and equal. Today, another element enters into equation: global 
interdependence, which neither Eastern Europe nor America can neglect. It 
manifests itself in security, economic, fiscal and political ties. Since 1989 
-- the year that Solidarity assumed power in Poland -- a number of solid 
bridges have been erected between East and West.  
</P>
<P>
 Democratic governments, free elections and market-driven economies became new 
political realities. Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel are both products of that 
reality. They received accolades (including a Nobel Peace Prize for Walesa), 
political encouragement and fiscal assistance. The aid channeled through the 
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund put the prestige of these two 
institutions and their judgment on the line.  
</P>
<P>
 It is the economic growth that is being counted upon by numerous American and 
multinational corporations. They keep testing the newly opening markets as well 
as manufacturing facilities.Modern technologies, be they in telecommunication, 
transportation or merchandising, are being absorbed eagerly by Eastern 
Europeans. The United States, for years suffering from negative trade balances, 
may be looking toward these new markets to alleviate that problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus interdependence has taken root, yet it appears to have been negated by 
the Clinton Administration. The issue of NATO membership has been interpreted 
solely from the Eastern European perspective, neglecting potential benefits and 
pitfalls for both sides. The pitfalls are in evidence in today's Poland. Recent 
elections -- free by any standard -- produced victory for former communists. 
While there is little doubt that harsh economic conditions played a role, a 
sense of abandonment by the West played an equally important role.  
</P>
<P>
 Poland, denigrated to satellite status during the last 50 years, yearns to be 
readmitted to the Western family of nations as a full partner rather than an 
associate. The current discussion related to NATO, bypassing the reality of 
existing interdependence, made Poles feel pressured once again to look 
eastward. The protest vote, bringing to a democratic Poland a communist prime 
minister, should be a warning to all those who five years ago celebrated the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, there was another warning recently from Moscow: 
Parliamentary elections catapulted into prominence a demagogue calling openly 
for restoration of a defunct Russian empire. Should this be translated into 
action, a strong rebuff by the Czech Republic or Poland would trigger global 
repercussions -- another indication of interdependence in the security area. 
</P>
<P>
 An anonymous State Department official was quoted as suggesting that Eastern 
Europeans should accept the partnership idea; otherwise, he implied, America 
will just go elsewhere. I suddenly saw once again the surprised face of the 
American consul in 1945 encouraging me not to emigrate to the States but to 
return home. Is it possible that he is still around, devising the new policy?

PERSPECTIVES ON OPENING NATO MEMBERSHIP; NO: THE ALLIANCE IS ONLY A HUSK OF 
OUTDATED MYTHS; ADDING EASTERN EUROPE COULD SUCK AMERICA INTO A MAELSTROM OF 
BIG-POWER RIVALRIES AND FUTURE BOSNIAS.

<P>
 The quibbling over whether Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Ukraine 
should be admitted to NATO masks the real issues in America's post-Cold War 
European policy -- whether NATO's extension into Eastern Europe, or indeed the 
alliance's continuing existence, serves U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has pulled out all the stops to reaffirm NATO's 
continuing importance. But these arguments are nothing more than a collection 
of shopworn myths. 
</P>
<P>
 * Myth No. 1: European security is crucial because America invariably becomes 
involved in the Continent's wars. Since America gained independence, Europe has 
experienced great-power conflicts in 1792, 1801, 1805-1815, 1866, 1870 and 1877 
-- none of which remotely affected U.S. security. American intervention in 
World War I was driven by ideological concerns, not security threats, and 
foreclosed the possibility of a compromise peace that might have ended the war 
before revolutions unhinged Europe. Washington's attempt to impose a Wilsonian 
peace on post-World War I Europe sowed the seeds both of World War II and of 
many of today's conflicts.  
</P>
<P>
 * Myth No. 2: The United States can unite post-Cold War Europe. In fact, 
modern Europe has never been united because the East has consistently lagged 
behind Western Europe in politicaland economic development and has been more 
prone to domestic political turmoil.  
</P>
<P>
 * Myth No. 3: By promoting the spread of democracy in Eastern Europe and the 
former Soviet Union, the United States can ensure peace. The notion that 
democracies do not fight democracies is popular but untrue. Thus even if 
democracy takes root firmly in Eastern Europe, peace is not guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Myth No. 4: The spread of free markets and economic interdependence to all 
of Europe will promote peace. The idea that free trade creates a "harmony of 
interests" and thus leads to peace is another fashionable idea than has been 
repeatedly disproved. No doubt European turbulence will have some effect on 
American economic interests. But great powers that depend on distant and 
unstable regions for their prosperity pay a big price. Far from being a force 
for peace, today's version of interdependence simply rationalizes the dangerous 
extension of American security guarantees into an endemically turbulent region. 
</P>
<P>
 * Myth No. 5: The United States can bring "stability" to post-Cold War Eastern 
Europe just as it did to post-World War II Western Europe. Peace and 
cooperation supplanted war and competition because the Soviet threat forced 
Western Europe to coalesce and because America protected the West Europeans 
from themselves. The Soviet presence in Eastern Europe stabilized relations in 
that region. The "long peace" since 1945 was a product of the Cold War and 
without bipolarity, Europe inevitably is headed back to its normal patterns 
featuring war, great-power security and economic competition. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO has failed conspicuously to resolve the Bosnian conflict -- the archetype 
of the kind of instability NATO is supposed to deal with -- because, at least 
until now, its members wisely have been reluctant to become involved in such 
quagmires.  
</P>
<P>
 But even more troubling than the prospect of U.S. military involvement in 
future Bosnias is the certainty that if NATO "moves east," the United States 
will find itself in the middle of big-power rivalries involving Germany, Russia 
and Ukraine. The Administration's policy will not prevent European upheaval, 
but simply ensure that the United States is swept up in the maelstrom. In the 
final analysis, Eastern Europe's quarrels are between people of whom we know -- 
and should want to know -- nothing.

GETTING THE MAX OUT OF METRO RAIL; TOURISM: MOVING A STOP TO UNIVERSAL CITY 
WOULD MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE USER-FRIENDLY FOR VISITORS AND RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK KYSER, Jack Kyser is chief economist of the Economic Development Corp. 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rapidly developing Metro Rail system will pass close to the Coliseum, the 
Sports Arena, the expanded Convention Center in Downtown Los Angeles, the 
expanded Downtown Central Library, the Music Center and Los Angeles 
International Airport, but will not have stops at any of these major centers of 
regional activity. As they say, close but no cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there is an opportunity to prevent another near-miss by Metro Rail, and 
the destination is Universal City. Metro Rail's builder, the Los Angeles County 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is considering a proposal to move a 
planned station site to the heart of Universal City, on MCA property. In 
considering this possible relocation, the MTA is looking at the costs and 
potential savings associated with the proposal as well as the impact on the 
construction schedule. But the MTA should also consider the regional economic 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 As the largest public works project in the United States, Metro Rail 
construction is providing many direct and indirect benefits to the troubled 
Southern California economy. It makes sense to maximize the benefits that Metro 
Rail can provide, both short- and long-term. One benefit of a relocated station 
at Universal City would be an improved transportation linkage for our key 
tourism industry. This would impact both jobs and sales tax collections. 
</P>
<P>
 The MCA Universal City property, with its movie theaters, City Walk, Universal 
Amphitheater, Universal Studios Hollywood and hotels and restaurants is the 
most important tourism and entertainment center in the city of Los Angeles, and 
a place that residents and visitors can enjoy 365 days a year. A Metro Rail 
stop at this site will strengthen the competitive stance of tourism in Los 
Angeles while reducing automobile traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of local residents and tourists visit Universal City each year, but 
as currently planned there will be no convenient way for them to get from the 
station to either the hotels or entertainment attractions. It would certainly 
help the Convention and Visitors Bureau in promoting the expanded Convention 
Center to be able to say: "It is a short, convenient ride on Metro Rail from 
any hotel downtown to Universal City." Moreover, surveys done by the Economic 
Development Corp. indicate that Los Angeles is not considered "user-friendly" 
to tourists, especially as concerns transportation. A Metro Rail stop at 
Universal City would help to dispel that image. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception, the goal of Metro Rail has been to lessen the region's 
dependence on automobiles, mainly for residents. Visitors to the area should 
also be considered as riders. Moving the Universal City station would maximize 
Metro Rail's benefits of reducing congestion, improving mobility and improving 
air quality, as well as improve our competitive stance in tourism. Let's not 
miss this opportunity.

<P>
 The Assembly Public Safety Committee has unanimously approved legislation to 
allow law enforcement officials to seize assets of employers who repeatedly 
hire illegal immigrants as workers. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-0 vote sent the bill (AB 2404) by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), 
a probable candidate for attorney general, to the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 First offense convictions would be punishable by fines, with subsequent 
convictions calling for asset forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that employment is the lure to illegal immigrants," Umberg said, "and 
that clearly is where we should focus our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 ASSEMBLY

by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) to create a statewide task force to 
investigate arson-related crimes such as last year's devastating Southern 
California brush fires. An 11-0 vote sent the bill to the Ways and Means 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Term Limits: The Elections Committee rejected a bill (AB 139) by Assemblyman 
Dean Andal (R-Stockton) to allow voters to impose term limits on local elected 
officials such as members of city councils and county boards of supervisors. 
With four votes needed for approval, the committee vote was 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Campaign Finance Reform: The Elections Committee approved a bill (AB 2216) 
by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto) to place an advisory measure on the 
statewide election ballot asking voters if they want campaign finance reform. A 
4-2 vote sent the bill to the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * South Africa: The Utilities and Commerce Committee approved a bill (AB 2448) 
by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) to lift the ban on the 
investment of state trust funds in businesses that operate in South Africa now 
that apartheid has apparently been abolished in that country. An 11-0 vote sent 
the bill to the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Introductions 
</P>

 * Armor-Piercing Bullets: AB 13X by Assemblywoman Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte) 
would allow judges to add five to 10 years to prison sentences of criminals 
convicted of committing crimes while using bullets designed to penetrate body 
armor worn by law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arsonist Registration: AB 8X by Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) would 
require registration of all people convicted of arson or attempted arson so 
that local law enforcement officials can keep track of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gun Ammunition Licenses: AB 2449 by Assemblywoman Dede Alpert (D-San Diego) 
would prohibit the sale of gun ammunition without a state license issued by the 
Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Handgun Penalties: AB 10X by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) 
would require judges to impose an additional 20-year prison sentence on any

landlords to check with the state Department of Justice for sex, drug or 
violent crime records of prospective tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Illegal Immigrants: AB 2477 by Assemblywoman Margaret E. Snyder (D-Modesto) 
would make it a felony to make or sell fake citizenship or resident documents 
to illegal immigrants. Penalties would range up to five years in state prison 
and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Absentee Voters: AB 2446 by Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) 
would allow registered voters to apply for permanent absentee voter status so 
they can vote by mail for all elections. 
</P>
<P>
 * Offshore Oil Drilling: AB 2444 by Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria)

<P>
 Bill Introductions 
</P>
<P>
 * School Taxes: SB 1261 by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) would allow

COMPUTER FILE: GORE'S LONG HIGHWAY TO SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore wants to help build a high-speed information highway by 
the year 2000. But so far he's having trouble accessing electronic mail at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's personal frustrations as the nation's highest-ranking computer expert 
are indicative of what he faces in his efforts to extend the benefits of modern 
technology to the country as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore himself has a pretty good setup, including both a Macintosh PowerBook Duo 
270-c and an AST IBM-compatible personal computer. He uses the machines for 
electronic mail, writing speeches and "personal projects." 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House computer system, in Gore's words, "is a museum piece." 
</P>
<P>
 "The White House that we inherited was way, way, way behind the curve, and we 
have spent the last year trying to get it up to speed," Gore said in an 
interview Tuesday, shortly after he delivered his "superhighway summit" address 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore has a lot of work to do. His struggle at the White House, like his 
challenge to build the data superhighway, will require changes in technology, 
regulations and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Take vice presidential e-mail. "There are some communications within the White 
House that can only take place electronically if you don't do certain things, 
and it's frustrating to me because I think we ought to be fully linked to the 
Internet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedom of Information Act, which Gore supports, has provisions for 
storage and retrieval of government communications and correspondence. The 
White House has long had procedures for paper mail, but issues regarding e-mail 
have not been fully resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as with the data highway, there are privacy issues. "What people may 
think is a private message to us has to be kept in public files."  
</P>
<P>
 Millions of Americans are already using the Internet and commercial on-line 
services to exchange e-mail. But sending e-mail to the White House can be a 
frustrating experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Gore do have e-mail addresses (Gore's Internet address is 
vice.president @whitehouse.gov) but messages are printed out and answered via 
U.S. mail, assuming the person remembered to include a postal address. Even 
then, a lot of people, including myself, have discovered that the White House 
often fails to respond to its e-mail. Gore says that will change. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore has often joked about the White House's antiquated telephone system, 
which, when he and Clinton took office, had rotary-dial phones and an 
old-fashioned switchboard. 
</P>
<P>
 If the technologically savvy White House staff is having trouble modernizing 
its own facilities, one can't help but wonder how long it will take before we 
reach the Administration's goal, to "connect all of our classrooms, all of our 
libraries and all of our hospitals and clinics by the year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And even if we do reach that goal, will the technology help solve the many 
social problems facing our society? If millions of Americans can't read, how 
can we expect them to log on to the Internet and on-line services?  
</P>
<P>
 "Nations like Cuba just put us to shame where adult literacy is concerned," 
Gore said. "And it's time we realized the need for a national program to deal 
with this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Laudably, but perhaps over-optimistically, Gore contends that "information 
technologies can themselves make a contribution to combatting illiteracy." I 
agree, but my local school district doesn't have enough money for pencils and 
paper, let alone Macs and PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 A digital superhighway won't be of much use to schools that don't have enough 
computers. Our current interstate highway system offers free access, but you 
can't get on them if you don't have access to a car or bus ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Gore has a lot of work to do. I wish him well.

TANDY WILL ADD STORES, INCREASE WORK FORCE BY 3,600; GROWTH: THE NATION'S 
LARGEST ELECTRONICS RETAILER WILL OPEN 30 NEW OUTLETS AS IT CONTINUES ITS 
AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY TO EXPAND. 
</P>

<P>
 Tandy Corp., the nation's largest electronics retailer, said Wednesday that 
the aggressive retail growth strategy it started last year will create more 
than 3,600 jobs in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the jobs will come as Tandy adds 24 Computer City and six Incredible 
Universe stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driven by new store openings and innovative services ideas, 1994 should 
provide excellent sales growth for Tandy," Chairman and Chief Executive John 
Roach said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts saw little new in the announcement but said it highlights the 
momentum created by Tandy's decision to shed its manufacturing businesses and 
focus on retail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an aggressive plan but one which I think Tandy can make and manage," 
said Dennis Van Zelfden, retail and consumer product analyst at Rauscher Pierce 
Refsnes Inc. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the new jobs, about 1,800 will come with the six Incredible Universe stores 
added to the three already open. Two of the warehouse-size stores will open in 
Miami and Tempe, Ariz.; locations for the other four have not been announced, 
said Lou Ann Blaylock, Tandy's vice president of corporate relations. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,600 employees will be added at the 24 new Computer City Supercenters. 
None of those locations have been revealed, Blaylock said. Tandy has 40 
Computer City stores open now. 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy will also add about 200 employees at its Ft. Worth headquarters. About 
half those workers will be administrative, and the rest will work in Tandy's 
information systems area, doing jobs such as computer analysis of the company's 
sophisticated point-of-sale database, Blaylock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy has about 7,000 stores and dealers, including 6,500 Radio Shack outlets. 
Other chains include McDuff Electronics, Videoconcepts and Edge in Electronics.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; SUPPORT BY STUDENT ALLIANCE IS OVERDUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am saddened and at the same time outraged by the views expressed by Robert 
Dodge, Steve Grimes and Mat Gratias, students at Fountain Valley High School, 
and members of the Future Good Boys of America ("Moral Outrage Fuels Anti-Gay 
School Protest," Jan. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 The article that was penned by the above named individuals illustrates the 
right-wing, conservative narrow-mindedness that is all too often displayed by 
teens living in Orange County. To suggest that the Fountain Valley High School 
Student Alliance is a club that advocates sodomy, oral copulation or sexual 
promiscuity is absolutely ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 If Vietnamese, African American, Mexican American or any other minority group 
of students seeks to form an alliance (by definition, "an agreement to work 
together"), they are encouraged to do so and supported by everyone from school 
officials to the media. However, when an alliance is formed that consists of a 
group of students seeking to support one another in dealing with the pain and 
struggle of living in a society that bad-mouths, alienates and ostracizes those 
who do not conform to what is considered "normal," it is labeled as a 
"transgression against the moral principles of our country." 
</P>
<P>
 No one chooses to live with the threat of HIV and AIDS. No one chooses to live 
with the fear of being beaten and left for dead. No one chooses to live knowing 
that what they feel will deem them an unacceptable member of society.  
</P>
<P>
 The members of the Fountain Valley High School Student Alliance need one 
another to stand against the kind of shallow, reactionary tactics displayed by 
not only the students that make up the Future Good Boys of America, but by 
students, parents and community members afraid of something that is contrary to 
what exists in their "perfect," gift-wrapped world. 
</P>
<P>
 The formation of the Fountain Valley High School Student Alliance is long 
overdue, and its members should be commended for their courage and fortitude. 
Unfortunately, their struggles have just begun.

LEARNING TO SAY GOODBY; FAMILIES: SINGLE PARENTS WITH AIDS FACE THE WRENCHING 
REALITY OF PREPARING THEIR CHILDREN FOR A FUTURE WITHOUT THEM. FOUR DISCUSS THE 
PAINFUL CHOICES THEY MUST MAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At age 3, Erin was told: Mom isn't feeling well. She needs to lie down. At 
age, 4, she was told: Mom and Dad have bad blood, and they will get real sick. 
At age 5, Erin knew her mother had died of an AIDS-related disease and that her 
father was probably next. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at age 8, Erin knows exactly what will happen to her. She ticks off a 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be going with my grandma after my dad dies," said Erin, her gaze 
direct, her voice even. "And, if my grandma dies, which she probably won't, I'm 
going to be going with my (great) Aunt Sandy. And if my Aunt Sandy dies, which 
she definitely won't, I'm going with (family friend) Tangie." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Mari, 10, is kept in the dark about her mother's AIDS. Mari 
recently told a counselor at the AIDS Service Center in Pasadena that her 
mother is fine. End of subject. "Momma," Mari tells her single mother, "I'm 
going to live with you forever." Later she confides to a visitor that she wants 
to be a librarian or a doctor when she grows up. 
</P>
<P>
 Why a doctor? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because a doctor can tell if people have AIDS or not and if they're sick." 
</P>
<P>
 And what is AIDS? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two families, two distinct approaches in trying to prepare children for a 
parent's death and the stigma of AIDS. Erin's father and Mari's mother are 
clients at the AIDS Service Center in Pasadena. In a sobering nod to the 
epidemic's reach, the center is gently steering HIV-positive parents through a 
new program to help them pick the people who take over child-rearing after 
their deaths and to teach them how to say goodby to their children. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, services such as guardianships and 
child counseling were virtually unheard of because the virus affected primarily 
gay men. But the disease's increasing sweep into the heterosexual population is 
prompting AIDS service providers to expand their reach to families with 
dependent children. 
</P>
<P>
 Every month at the Aids Service Center, two or three families ask for help 
with guardianships and counseling. Early this year, the center will hire a 
full-time legal guardianship attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's going to take care of the kids?" said Ursula Arndt, coordinator of the 
center's Family Pediatric Program. "Can we find enough foster parents? Whose 
burden is it going to be -- taxpayers, private (funding), corporate? Who's 
going to love them and educate them? . . . It's going to be a big social 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, 45 families have come to the center's Family Pediatric 
Program for some kind of help. Among them are 105 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents with the AIDS virus often need to be steered toward handling legal 
responsibilities, said Ian Stulberg, coordinator of the center's mental health 
program. Otherwise, they cling to denial of what the future brings for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're deciding on a guardianship, you're confirming you won't be around 
to see your children grow up," he said. "That's psychologically real hard for 
people to face." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most families agreed to be interviewed for this story on the condition that 
their last names be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS is crippling families. According to a December, 1992, article in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn., 82,000 children could lose their mothers 
to acquired immune deficiency syndrome by the year 2000, resulting in a 
possible "social catastrophe." The study examined only mothers with AIDS 
because they usually are the primary care-givers. The AIDS epidemic will rival 
or surpass other leading causes of death in mothers of young children, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we really protecting anybody by shielding them and letting them believe 
in an age of innocence?" Arndt said. "We have to start dealing with the 
realities." 
</P>
<P>
 Stulberg advocates honesty with children, step by step and in small doses. 
Ignorance is seldom bliss in families touched by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder on the kids in the long run," he said. "They become confused or 
they think they did something wrong, and they think that's why they've been 
kept in the dark . . . As painful as it is, it's best when parents can be as 
honest as (possible about) what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Erin, the 8-year-old who eventually will live with her grandmother, is bracing 
herself for more unhappiness. Her mother died of AIDS complications three years 
ago at age 33, and her father's condition was diagnosed as AIDS in 1992; 
neither knows who was infected first or how. Erin's mother was a nurse; her 
father is a former hospital marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin, who does not have the AIDS virus, lives with her father, Tim, at his 
mother's house in the San Gabriel Valley foothills. Someday, Erin knows, her 
57-year-old paternal grandmother will take over as her legal guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents tried to be honest from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every step they told me," said Erin, a straight-A student who still prays at 
bedtime for happy dreams about her mother. "I don't think it's right (for 
parents) to have secrets. . . I can tell (Dad) isn't walking right. I would 
know right then that he had some kind of disease and wasn't healthy. I wouldn't 
need to ask." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that knowledge protects children from pain. Right before her mother died, 
for hours at a time, Erin pounded boards together in the back yard to release 
her anguish. When her father dies, she admits tearfully, she probably will lash 
out at her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim, 34, is trying to prepare Erin. He shows no major AIDS symptoms, but his 
T-cell count is dangerously low. 
</P>
<P>
 HIV damages T-cells, which are critical components of the immune system. A 
healthy person has about 1,000 T-cells per cubic millimeter of blood to fight 
off infections and diseases. Doctors consider a T-cell count of less than 200 a 
sign of AIDS. Tim's T-cell count is 51. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He talks to Erin about what might happen, holding her in his lap or sitting 
outside with her on the patio at McDonald's. Every night, they sit together and 
work on her homework, sometimes for two hours. They look at pictures of her 
mother. Erin goes to group counseling for children with terminally ill parents 
at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part is knowing that I'm not going to be here for Erin," said 
Tim, who sometimes lies sleepless at night, worrying about his daughter's 
future. "Not a day goes by when I don't think about that." 
</P>
<P>
 That burden, said Tim, is heavy enough. He can't imagine the stress of hiding 
his condition from Erin. 
</P>
<P>
 Mari's mother, Teena, knows it's time to tell her three children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real hard to hold a secret in," the 29-year-old Azusa woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a guardian also was hard. Teena is separated from her unemployed 
husband, who seldom visits the children. He is not infected with the virus. She 
has a mother and nine brothers and sisters, all of whom live in the area, but 
she has felt estranged from them since her AIDS diagnosis. They all mistakenly 
believe that AIDS is spread through casual contact; she can expect no shelter 
for her children from them, and she doesn't want it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want my kids to be (with them)," Teena said. "I don't want them to 
be in a place where they feel like I do . . . like an outcast." 
</P>
<P>
 So she is turning to her best friend since kindergarten, a single mother in 
Pasadena with two small children. 
</P>
<P>
 Teena and her children live in a four-bedroom condominium, subsisting on 
government rent subsidies and welfare. Before her illness, Teena worked as a 
preschool assistant and was studying early childhood education at Pasadena City 
College. Her condition was diagnosed last summer, and she believes she 
contracted AIDS from a former boyfriend.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, she shows no serious signs of the virus, only fatigue and sometimes 
headaches or nausea. But her T-cell count is down to 50. 
</P>
<P>
 She prefers not to discuss the virus that is sapping her strength, slowing her 
walk. She fights it with denial, sometimes not taking any of her seven 
medications. And she would rather talk about her three kids -- how Mari, 10, 
sneaks books into bed every night; how Corrine, 8, already has two or three 
boyfriends, depending on which day you ask; how Richard, 5, will surely be a 
computer whiz someday. 
</P>
<P>
 But a sense of urgency hovers. Teena feels it on days when she doesn't have 
the strength to lift Richard to his top bunk or when she's too tired to help 
Mari with her math homework.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, for the first time, Teena took Mari to talk to her counselor at 
the AIDS Service Center, although neither she nor the counselor revealed what 
the meeting was about. Teena grimaced when she was told what Mari said about 
wanting to be a doctor and help people with AIDS. She had thought the children 
were happily unaware of her illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to keep things from her," Teena admitted sadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Her New Year's resolution was to tell all the children that she has AIDS and 
enroll them in counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be able to tell them that this is what happened, and even though 
something tragic came out of it, (our relationship) was something beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Teena plans to tell them to hold tight to their memories -- the mornings when 
all three little ones sneak into her bed, one by one; the Christmas wreaths 
they made out of leaves and twine; their first snowfall in Portland, Ore., when 
they all ran outside in their pajamas at 3 a.m. to make snow angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothea Hollins already has carried through on her plans. She wanted to spare 
her children the sight of her AIDS-related drenching night sweats and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer she sent her two young children to live with her 22-year-old 
daughter in a small Mississippi town. Her daughter, an accounting major in 
college, is married to a steel-mill worker. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came after the days of watching Argie, Dorothea's playful 
10-year-old son, run to his room and shut the door when her nurses hooked her 
up to intravenous drips. It came after the times she was too weary to watch her 
12-year-old daughter, Tyshameka, dance and sing in school productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I wasn't really being a mother to them, and they deserve 
something better," said Dorothea, who believes she was infected by her 
unfaithful husband. "I can't take care of my children. I can barely take care 
of myself." Her husband, a pastor, died eight years ago, 22 days after his 
condition was diagnosed as AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothea, a former Xerox Corp. administrator, now spends most of her days 
watching TV and sleeping at her parents' cramped three-bedroom house in La 
Puente. She is weak from recent bouts with pneumonia and fighting off 
AIDS-related dementia. Her T-cell count is one. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Hollins had braced her children for the end. So when she 
told them it was time for them to go on without her, they packed up and left. 
No questions. No arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Now: "I have an emptiness." 
</P>
<P>
 Lidiana has reason to hope that her goodby day with her children is far off. 
She is HIV-positive but does not yet have AIDS; half of HIV-positive patients 
do not develop AIDS for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the 19-year-old mother of two preschoolers already finds that everyday 
routines suddenly take on new significance -- playing soccer with her toddler 
son, struggling to get her little girl's Aladdin nightshirt off in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of her counselor, Lidiana signed legal guardianship papers for 
her children after she was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1991. She arranged for 
her mother, who lives in Gardena, to take care of Diana, 4, and Jose, 2. As a 
backup, she asked her children's two godmothers to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lidiana, who shares a Highland Park apartment with friends, says she is 
the only one who can rock the children to sleep in her arms every night. She is 
the only one who can feed her two picky eaters by "airplaning" vegetables into 
their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, nobody's going to treat them like a mom treats them. . . . The hardest 
thing for me is to leave them and think they (the new guardians) are not going 
to take care of (the kids) the way I take care of my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Lidiana was first pregnant at age 15. Ever since she was 8, when her little 
brother was born, Lidiana has wanted to be a mother. She was always chunky as a 
child, so she used to stand in front of the mirror and jut out her stomach, 
trying to imagine what it was like to be pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned she was HIV-positive after her second child was born; neither of 
her children have the AIDS virus. Lidiana believes she was infected by her 
former boyfriend, who used intravenous drugs without her knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Lidiana suffers from headaches, fatigue and shingles, which are painful 
clusters of blisters. This year, she will start taking her little girl to 
counseling at the AIDS Service Center. She doesn't know exactly when -- or how 
-- she'll tell the children she is sick. But she knows when she'll say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see myself lying in the bed and can't walk or see my kids, I'm going 
to disappear from their lives," Lidiana said resolutely. "You see, I want them 
to remember the mom from now. I don't want them to remember the mom who is 
lying in the bed, suffering and in pain." Single Parents and AIDS

Facts on Families and AIDS 
</P>
<P>
 * Four months ago, the AIDS Service Center in Pasadena started the family 
pediatric program, which provides free care to families affected by the AIDS 
virus. Because of a growing need, the program's services include counseling for 
parents with AIDS and their children. The program serves 45 families and 105 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 * According to a December, 1992, study in the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn., 82,000 children could lose their mothers to AIDS by the year 2000, 
resulting in a possible "social catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 * The AMA study also notes that each year, nearly 13,000 children and 
adolescents lose mothers under the age of 50 to cancer, and about 5,000 as the 
result of car accidents. In contrast, the AIDS-related number is about 7,000 
and growing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles County, 23,156 AIDS cases have been diagnosed, according to 
the Department of Health Services. In the United States, that number is 
339,250, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Statistics are unavailable on the number of parents with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 * AIDS ranks fourth among leading causes of death for women ages 25 to 44, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

WESTSIDE WATCH: THEY GLIDE ON A WING, A PRAYER -- AND SKATES

<P>
 Nearly 15 years ago, Santa Monica resident Jamie Budge sailed from Seattle to 
San Diego . . . on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 With a pair of roller skates, a hand-held sail, and a back-up van to speed him 
through the doldrums, Budge navigated the West Coast's windiest canyons and 
open roads in 17 days. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing the sport he says he invented on a Santa Monica Pier parking lot 
attract a small but steadily growing following, Budge is about to hit the big 
time. The 49-year-old photographer and video producer recently negotiated a 
deal with ESPN to broadcast a wind-skating contest this spring on the dry lake 
beds of El Mirage, near Palmdale. 
</P>

 Dozens of "blade-sailors" will participate in a two-mile triangle regatta, 
speed sprints, slalom courses, ramp-jumping and a "freestyle wind-blown 
ballet."

 NOT THE GREATEST TIMING: For a community struggling to snuff out a real gang 
war, the last thing anyone needs is an unannounced, make-believe gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what happened in the violence-plagued Oakwood neighborhood of 
Venice this week, where a four-month gang war has left 11 dead and nearly 30 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 A film company began filming a scene Tuesday that involved fake gunfire. 
Jittery locals could hardly be blamed for thinking it was the real thing. Some 
phoned 911. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's office was flooded with angry phone calls, 
and by day's end, the film permit, issued to a West Los Angeles production 
company called Concorde/New Horizon, had been pulled. But the incident was not 
necessarily the fault of the company, which was required to warn only police -- 
not residents -- of the simulated shooting.

 One constituency is lobbying for Machado Road, in honor of the family that 
received a Spanish land grant for the Ballona Valley in 1819. Another group 
wants it named Perkins Way, after a former city councilman who proposed the 
road, now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 And a third proposal -- Senior Citizen's Way -- is drawing support from 
current Councilman Albert Vera, who said: "We're all going to be senior 
citizens soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The council deadlocked on the issue Monday but is scheduled to take it up 
again Jan. 24.

 GLENDORA: Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne ordered the city this week to pay 
roughly $24,000 in attorney's fees to the Glendora Preservation Foundation, 
bringing the city's bill for fighting a foundation lawsuit to more than 
$100,000. The foundation successfully sued the city last April over demolition 
of a potentially historic 83-year-old Craftsman bungalow.

CITY HALL: PASADENA; CITY TO PICK UP DISCARDED TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the game of Christmas-tree chicken between the city and residents, the city 
admits it will blink first. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, the city picked up the trees for recycling into mulch.This 
year, the city wants residents to haul the trees off themselves to recycling 
centers, or chop them up to fit into the appropriate recycling bins. 
</P>
<P>
 The public isn't buying it, with the result that hundreds of discarded 
Christmas trees still line the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell from driving around the city there are a lot of Christmas trees at 
the curb," said Barbara B. Cathey, Pasadena's administrator for solid waste 
planning and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city changed its policy because it automated trash collection with small 
trucks that pick up special garbage cans. The automation replaces sanitation 
workers who could handle trees, Cathey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curbside pick-up is now available for an additional $10 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathey expresses little sympathy for residents who complain about the burden 
of hauling a tree to a pickup point. "How did they get the tree to their home? 
They should think about that as the way to get it to the drop-off," Cathey 
said. "If they are worried about the mess, it can be wrapped in plastic bags." 
</P>
<P>
 Drop-off locations are open from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. today and Friday. Locations 
are Brookside Park, 360 N. Arroyo Blvd.; Allendale Park, 1130 S. Marengo Ave.; 
City Yard, 233 W. Mountain St.; Eaton Blanche Park, 3100 E. Del Mar Blvd.; 
Hamilton Park, 3680 Cartright St.; Robinson Park, 1081 N. Fair Oaks Ave.; and 
Washington Park, Washington Boulevard and El Molino Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cathey acknowledged that if trees remain on the curbs in coming weeks, the 
city will be forced to haul them away. Free.

PANEL REJECTS PRIVATIZATION OF LOS LIONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a two-year dispute, the state Parks and Recreation Commission has 
squelched plans to allow part of Los Liones Canyon in Pacific Palisades to be 
sold to a private developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, which met this week in Santa Monica, voted 7 to 2 against a 
proposal by Temple Kihillath Israel and the Pacific Palisades-Malibu YMCA to 
buy state-owned property in the lower part of the canyon to build facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled next to Sunset Boulevard, the 32-acre property has long been touted by 
parks enthusiasts as a critical link between the city and Topanga State Park. 
They opposed plans by the Temple and YMCA to purchase up to 12 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's decision was a blow to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which 
owns the property. Its executive director, Joseph T. Edmiston, had promoted a 
complicated land swap that would have allowed the Temple and YMCA to build 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sends a clear message that parkland should be preserved as parkland and 
that is a positive thing," said Lamont Johnson, whose group wants to establish 
a botanical garden on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ruling out privatization, the decision leaves the property's future 
unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 4 1/2-hour hearing attended by more than 200 people, the commission 
heard at least 10 proposed uses for the parkland, ranging from community 
playing fields to a Native American interpretive center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to get help from many of the people who've made their feelings 
known," said Dan Preece, an area state parks superintendent. Preece said his 
cash-strapped agency has little money to develop the parkland on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The property was transferred from the state parks department to the 
conservancy last year as part of a land swap arranged in 1992. That year the 
conservancy agreed to buy several privately owned acres near Malibu Creek State 
Park that were about to be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy agreed to swap the Malibu parcels and its 22-acre Temescal 
Gateway Park in Pacific Palisades to the state parks department in return for 
the Los Liones property. 
</P>
<P>
 In informal talks with the conservancy, the Temple and YMCA had expressed 
willingness to provide parking, build a trail head for the important link into 
Topanga State Park and help pay for playing fields for community use on part of 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents, including some nearby residents, lobbied state parks Director 
Donald Murphy to quash the idea. Murphy announced his opposition to the plan in 
September.

THEY HELPED FAMILIES SALVAGE TREASURES FROM THE ASHES; FIRE AFTERMATH: 
VOLUNTEERS SEARCH HOME SITES, RECOVERING MORE THAN $20,000 WORTH OF JEWELRY. 
THEIR ONLY REWARD IS THE SMILES OF THANKFUL BENEFICIARIES.

 Jan Pazzi's diamond wedding ring survived last year's Altadena fire just fine, 
but it took a treasure-hunting hobbyist from Downey to retrieve it from the 
pile of debris that was once Pazzi's home. 
</P>
<P>
 George Johnson said he and his crew also were able to find most of Pazzi's 
other jewelry and her grandfather's pocket watch in the ruins of her Kinneloa 
Canyon Road home after a daylong search in mid-December. The effort barely beat 
the bulldozer blade -- Pazzi's lot was scheduled to be cleared by a county crew 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is a member of the Prospectors' Club of Southern California and the 
West Coast Prospectors and Treasure Hunters Assn., two groups that have come 
forward to filter more than 20 dump truck loads of ashes and debris through the 
metal screens of their sifters in hope of finding lost treasures for victims of 
the fires that destroyed hundreds of homes throughout Southern California in 
late October and early November. 
</P>
<P>
 Using skills honed through searches for missing murder weapons for the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department and hours spent combing Old West ghost 
towns, members of both clubs have conducted searches of more than 20 home 
sites. They have recovered more than $20,000 worth of rings set with diamonds, 
rubies and other precious stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Their only reward for the long hours and the countless cuts from chunks of 
broken glass that nick them through their work gloves is the smiles on the 
faces of homeowners after the prospectors find what they are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he went up to Pazzi with his hand closed, then opened it to 
reveal her ring. "Her scream could have been heard for 10 blocks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work completely for free -- heck, I've driven over 2,000 miles in the last 
few weeks working on searches in Laguna and Pasadena -- but her smile made it 
all worthwhile," said Johnson, 68, who retired to do treasure hunting after a 
30-year career as a boatswain's mate in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 In their searches, the prospectors use sifters that are 2-foot by 3-foot 
welded metal frames lined with wire screens that fit over wheelbarrows and 
35-gallon drums, Johnson said. Ashes and debris are shoveled onto the screens, 
and then the prospectors sort through the material that does not fall through 
the sifting screens into the drums and wheelbarrows underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the jewelry, nothing much else of value could be salvaged from the 
Pazzi home, which was destroyed along with 120 others in the Kinneloa and 
Pasadena Glen areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel so lucky to have found my wedding ring in all this," Pazzi said. 
Although the heat from the fire turned her children's play set into a puddle of 
colored plastic goo, her diamond came through the 2,000-degree heat unscathed. 
Finding it buoyed her spirits, and the work of the prospectors gave her hope 
that something could be salvaged from the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was especially great in today's world to see people ready to give their 
help to people for no money at all," said Pazzi, a 36-year-old homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her family might not rebuild their house because they might move 
closer to her husband's work in Orange County. They are currently renting a 
house in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 Pazzi spread the word of the treasure hunters' work to her neighbors, and 
Stacy Sproull, who lost her home in Kinneloa Estates, called on the groups to 
find a ruby ring her grandmother had left her and an antique surgical kit that 
belonged to her grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the ring was gone," said Sproull, 35. "Friends had dug through the 
whole area and found nothing. But these people really know what they're doing, 
and (Johnson) found the ring." 
</P>
<P>
 The searchers "also found a big, flat stone my daughter had painted for my 
husband when she was 2," Sproull said. "My daughter treasures it as much as my 
husband now that they found it . . . I'm so glad we found some things; if we 
hadn't done this, we would have always had this nagging feeling we could have 
found certain things." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea to start looking for homeowners' valuables came to Sandy Crawford, a 
past president of the West Coast Prospectors, when she heard about members 
helping out with searches after a fire in Glendale about three years ago and 
after the devastating Oakland blaze in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out at a house of one of our club members that was destroyed," 
said Crawford, 50, a homemaker from Los Alamitos who has been treasure hunting 
for 11 years. "We've been working the whole month of December." 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford and Johnson said both clubs are still ready to volunteer to help 
anyone search for valuables before bulldozers roll in and clear their lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still available," she said. "We're doing it for the joy. When we find 
something homeowners are looking for, the joy we see in their eyes makes it all 
worthwhile."

FREE CLINIC FOR POOR PATIENTS NOW IN FULL OPERATION; HEALTH CARE: THE NEW

IT SEEKS TO EXPAND ITS HELP AND PATIENT BASE.

 The Buddhist Tzu-Chi Free Clinic in Alhambra has negligible billing costs. 
That's because all of its medical services, from physicals to acupuncture, are 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, which opened in December and was born of a Buddhist charitable 
foundation with roots in Taiwan, offers physicals, dental and eye checkups, 
acupuncture, pregnancy tests, screenings, counseling and other primary care 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffed by volunteers, the clinic will treat only people who cannot afford 
insurance or health fees, and who make less than $10,000 a year. So far, it has 
treated more than 200 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the volunteers and patients are Asian, clinic volunteers 
emphasize that all patients who fit the financial profile are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no discrimination -- whoever comes to our door (will find) it's 
open," said office manager Melody Wang, adding that the clinic is searching for 
more Spanish-speaking volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the clinic's Buddhist roots are very visible. One of its 26 rooms is a 
small temple with a statue of Buddha and incense candles for patients who want 
to meditate. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiting room magazine rack is full of newsletters, articles and pamphlets 
about Master Jeng Yen, who founded the 3-million-member Buddhist Compassion 
Relief Tzu-Chi Foundation in Taiwan. The foundation, a nonprofit group, 
established its Monrovia office in 1988, and the Alhambra clinic project is 
similar to the Taiwanese foundation's sponsoring of a hospital and medical 
college in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the clinic followed a visit by local doctors and social worker 
Emily Teng last winter to Costa Mesa to deliver blankets and food for a 
charitable group. They took a photo of themselves, and when businessman Stephen 
Huang, chairman of the Monrovia chapter of the Tzu-Chi Foundation, saw it, he 
asked about the clinic for the poor that was visible in the background, Teng 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to several visits to clinics around Southern California, and weekly 
meetings throughout 1993. Huang, who owned a vacant cultural center on 1000 
Garfield Ave., decided to turn the 4,529-square-foot building into a free 
clinic for Alhambra and surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction, which cost $230,000, took about 10 months. Participating doctors 
donated equipment, and non-medical volunteers donated software for records and 
other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation hopes to get corporate and grant funding for some of the 
anticipated $500,000 annual operating budget, Teng said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70 physicians, 20 dentists, 40 nurses and 200 non-medical workers 
contributed work shifts at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by private donors -- mainly members of the foundation -- and the 
Chinese community, the clinic passed state and city inspection tests in October 
and began taking appointments in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Carrillo was among the first patients. He had lost all of his 
belongings, including his eyeglasses and dentures, when his apartment in 
downtown Los Angeles burned in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old shoe salesman was referred by a social worker to the clinic, 
where he was fitted for new glasses to correct his astigmatism, and new 
dentures. Everything was free. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last things I thought of were my glasses and dentures, but they were the 
first things I got back," he said. "It's a big, big help." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great need for organizations like this," said Alan Chen, a 
representative of Assemblywoman Hilda Solis of the 57th District, which 
includes Alhambra. "When we get constituents calling for help and access to 
health care, we can make referrals." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the capacity for 2 1/2 times more patients," said Dr. Chin-Lon Lin, 
medical director and one of the clinic's founders. "We've been getting mostly 
Asian patients . . . but we don't want it to be limited to only (Asians)." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the non-medical volunteers learned of the clinic through spots on 
Chinese TV stations and announcements in Buddhist newsletters. Paul Wang, a 
student, learned of the volunteer opportunity through his mother, who is 
Buddhist. 
</P>
<P>
 "She urged me to do it even though I'm Christian," he said. "She said not to 
look at it from the point of view of religion but from the point of view of 
helping people."  
</P>
<P>
 The founders considered a pay-as-you-can program, but decided against it, Lin 
said. "We didn't want the area hospitals (with sliding-scale fees) to feel we 
were competing. . . . This way, we can actually involve the area hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
 Participating medical centers and private physicians receive patients referred 
to them by the clinic after a free checkup and diagnosis of specific medical 
needs, office manager Melody Wang said. Special, major medical needs usually 
mean the patient is sent to a county hospital, but some patients in the past 
month received free surgery or prompt treatment at medical centers because of 
the connection to the clinic, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Hospital Medical Center, Garfield Medical Center and Alhambra 
Hospital allow the volunteer doctors from the clinic to use their facilities 
for needed surgery, said Wang, adding that the San Gabriel Medical Center is 
completing an agreement to receive patients sent there by the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential patients are screened to make sure they are eligible and are 
supposed to bring records, such as tax returns, to substantiate their low 
income. The clinic had to turn away about 30 unqualified people in November, 
Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 But an undocumented immigrant or someone who claims to have no records would 
be treated on a good-faith basis.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ten percent will take advantage of the services," Lin said. "But 90% will 
really need it."

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; MENTORS GUIDE HOMELESS YOUTHS TO HOPE; BRANCH OF LOS

 Most of Hollywood's homeless youths spend their days and nights running a 
gantlet of predatory adults in the form of pimps, perverts and thieves. It is 
an atmosphere hardly conducive to the youngsters' learning to trust adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Free Clinic's Hollywood Center, near Hollywood Boulevard and 
Gower Avenue, hopes to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, a nonprofit human services organization, provides medical care, 
counseling, job training and placement to homeless youths in addition to 
running the 2-year-old center, which is recruiting mentors to guide street kids 
from homelessness to self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these kids don't have any relationship with a supportive adult," 
says Julie Jaskol, a spokeswoman for the center, whose mentors meet weekly with 
the youths to help them set goals or discuss their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these children are ill-prepared for life's most basic routines -- 
they've never been told what to wear, what to say, how to get a driver's 
license, get a job," Jaskol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has 15 mentors for 35 young people from 12 to 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The mentor program aims to have at least 20 volunteers by the end of the year 
to meet its increasing demand. Up to 80 youths a month are turned away because 
of a lack of mentors, said Stephen Knight, the program's chief administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight said many volunteers have come away transformed. "Their perception of 
homeless youth has completely changed," he said. "We have lawyers and producers 
coming in here who used to see them as hoodlums. Now they see talented, smart 
kids with the same goals and desires as so-called normal children -- they 
realize the problems are in their backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Hayes, the writer and producer whose life as a young drug smuggler 
inspired the 1978 movie "Midnight Express," has worked as a mentor for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing it as much for them as for myself -- it's a way of balancing my 
karmic scales," he said. "I just helped someone learn how to drive the other 
day and I was (as) excited as they were. I'm contributing in a concrete, 
positive way. If you can't afford to give one hour a week, you're bulling 
someone. No one's that busy.' " ADRIAN MAHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: CITY COUNCIL REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BEVERLY HILLS: Maybe it's a sign of the economic times. The City Council wants 
to increase the tax on local hotel room rentals -- and hoteliers welcome the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase, which the council plans to consider Tuesday, will boost the bed 
tax from 12% to 14%. The resulting $1.2 million a year in revenues will be used 
to promote the city as a tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what pleases hotels. Like other local businesses, they could use an 
infusion of tourists to help offset the effects of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 MALIBU: Councilman Walt Keller this week took out papers to run for a second 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller's is one of two council seats up for election on April 12. The other is 
occupied by John Harlow, who was appointed to the council in April, 1992, to 
fill a vacancy. Harlow plans to run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten others have pulled nomination papers and must gather at least 20 
signatures to get on the ballot: David V. Lease, Jack T. Corrodi, Judy Decker, 
Robert H. Stratman, Greg Ball, Louis Ragsdale, Rami Alon Frankel, Edward 
Albert, Duncan T. Moran and Peter Tompkins. 
</P>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES: Joining other public and private agencies to help homeless 
veterans, the City Council has agreed to earmark $50,000 for a temporary 
shelter at the Veteran's Medical Center in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant would help the Veterans Administration and Salvation Army convert 
part of the medical center into a 21,000-square-foot transitional housing 
facility for homeless veterans. Veterans would be able to stay up to one year 
and receive job training, counseling and medical treatment. MEETINGS NEXT WEEK

RELIGION; RUSSIAN REFORM JUDAISM LEADER JOINS BENEFACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six years after Pomona Rabbi Earl Kaplan huddled with a group of Soviet Jews 
in Zinovy Kogan's barren Moscow apartment to illicitly study the Torah, the two 
men finally met on U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has changed over the years: The winds of perestroika pushed Kogan's 
congregation above ground to make him the leader of Reform Judaism in the 
former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc. Through those changes, Kaplan's Temple 
Beth Israel in Pomona has provided money, medicine and moral support. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is literally the George Washington of Reform Progressive Judaism in the 
former Soviet Union," Kaplan said during Kogan's visit Sunday. "Now, there are 
three dozen other congregations throughout the former Soviet Union and Eastern 
bloc, all modeled after (Kogan's) Congregation Hineini."  
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan remembers the furtive study sessions in Kogan's apartment, decorated 
only by an Israeli flag on the wall. Now, his Moscow congregation is more than 
500 strong, with two schools, a hospital program, and plans for a religious 
cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I came to United States, and I want to say thank you very much for the 
American Jews who helped in our beginning. It was very important for us," 
Kogan, 51, said in broken English. "I'm very optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Kogan's congregation shook off its cloak of secrecy and in 1990 
became the first religious institution not under government control to be 
recognized by the government. For 20 years before that, Kogan said, he and many 
refuseniks -- Soviet Jews who were not allowed to leave the Soviet Union for 
Israel -- met in underground schools where they conducted Reform services and 
studied Jewish Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Rabbi Kaplan came four years ago, I talk about my dreams, my programs. . 
. . Rabbi Kaplan and his congregation many times helped Hineini with medicine, 
with money," Kogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple Beth Israel is one of about half a dozen synagogues around the country 
that have pledged support for Hineini, including one in Pacific Palisades, 
Kaplan said.

HEALTH; NEARING THE END OF FLU SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's almost over. 
</P>
<P>
 The nasty flu season has most likely peaked, health experts say, just when it 
seemed as though nearly everyone was falling prey to high fevers, coughs and 
muscle ache. 
</P>
<P>
 "The height is usually the holiday season," or about mid-December to 
mid-January, although some people catch the flu as late as April, said Anne 
MacPherson, a public health nurse for Pasadena's Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the county Department of Health Services stopped giving flu 
vaccinations Dec. 10, spokeswoman Sharon Wanglin said. Vaccinations may still 
be available through some private physicians for high-risk patients, such as 
people over 60 years of age or those with chronic diseases, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say this flu season hasn't been as severe as most people 
believe. It appears worse only because it started about a month earlier than 
usual -- during the first week of November -- and coincided with other 
upper-respiratory illnesses, said Dr. Carol Peterson, a county medical 
epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 But local offices report that the flu and cold viruses are wiping out their 
staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our (university) president has been coming in bravely for weeks, fighting off 
this or that," said Anna Ganahl, director of communications at Pitzer College 
in Claremont. "We've all been following suit." Flu Tips 
</P>
<P>
 * Flu sufferers with major symptoms should stay home and rest the first three 
to five days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat lightly and drink plenty of fluids to keep the fever down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those who experience severe symptoms, are chronically ill or have a 
pulmonary disease should see a doctor. Pneumonia and bronchitis are two 
possible complications of influenza. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antiviral drugs -- such as amantadine or rimantadine -- may shorten the 
duration of flu in adults if prescribed early. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents should give young children and infants acetaminophen, like Tylenol, 
instead of aspirin to control fever.

BUSINESS; PASADENA DMV OFFICE NOW OPEN ON SATURDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rick Garcia took one look at the long lines at the Pasadena DMV office last 
week, turned around and drove back home to Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was packed, easily a several-hour wait," said the 27-year-old student, who 
had just moved from Arizona and needed a California driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 But he breezed through the lines Saturday, the first day of the Pasadena 
office's new Tuesday-through-Saturday schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of others who came to the Pasadena office last Saturday found shorter 
lines and waits that lasted mere minutes. Clerks assisted about 1,254 people -- 
about 450 fewer than on an average weekday. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning this year, 23 of the 174 Department of Motor Vehicle offices 
statewide have opened their doors on Saturdays -- most closing on Mondays -- to 
accommodate working people and students who might otherwise have to take time 
off from work or school. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley, the Pasadena and Pomona offices will be open 
Saturday (though just half the day in Pomona) and closed Monday. The West 
Covina office will keep its Monday-Friday hours and stay open an hour and a 
half later -- until 6:30 p.m. -- on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the down side, the new schedule is causing confusion: Nearly 100 motorists 
who showed up at the Pasadena office Monday found it closed. The DMV has tried 
to get the word out about the new hours by posting signs at its offices and 
sending out public service announcements to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 DMV officials say anyone who must do business with the DMV on Mondays can use 
other nearby offices. West San Gabriel Valley residents could use the West 
Covina, Lincoln Park or Glendale offices on Mondays. Residents of the eastern 
valley could use the West Covina or Rancho Cucamonga offices. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pasadena office last Saturday, many customers, as DMV officials call 
them, worried that the shorter Saturday lines won't last. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being open on Saturday is a fabulous idea, but I fear they'll be mobbed with 
people once everyone figures out they're open Saturdays," said Alhambra 
resident and elementary school teacher Carol Donuito, who had driven her mother 
to the office last Saturday for a driver's license test.  
</P>
<P>
 Later that morning, parking spots and short lines inside the office were hard 
to come by, but DMV officials said the morning rush petered out in the 
afternoon. New DMV Hours 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena office is open all day Saturday and the Pomona office is open for 
half a day on Saturday. The West Covina office will not be open Saturday but 
will stay open an hour and a half longer -- until 6:30 p.m. -- on Monday. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; HETEROSEXUAL HIV SUPPORT GROUP IN FAIRFAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new support group for HIV-positive heterosexuals recently started meeting on 
the Westside, at least the third such group known to have been formed in the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rico Porreca, a 50-year-old hemophiliac with AIDS, started the meetings in 
October at the Center for Living, a Fairfax District institute that helps 
people cope with terminal illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have AIDS in a heterosexual community is tough because there is no sense 
of community," said Porreca, a Fairfax resident. "We're not like black or 
Hispanic groups who have a common identity. Heterosexuals with HIV are hard to 
reach, are in denial or are desperately concerned about confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
 Porreca, who has been HIV-positive for eight years, says many heterosexuals 
infected with the virus that causes AIDS have trouble joining gay support 
groups, where gay lifestyles, interests and goals can diverge from their 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westside's first-known heterosexual HIV-positive support association, the 
Cosmos Circle, was started two years ago by a Mar Vista psychotherapist. It 
meets Wednesday nights in Mar Vista. Attendance usually numbers from 10 to 25 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months, the Jeffrey Goodman Special Care Clinic has conducted a 
support group for heterosexual couples at the Gay and Lesbian Community Center 
in Hollywood. Three couples regularly attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Porreca's group has five people who meet on Tuesday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're attempting to be more expansive, to create a feeling that there are 
more people out there like us," Porreca said. "By having a second Westside 
location, we're giving people more options and limiting the chance to make 
scheduling or geographic excuses and remain isolated."

 ARCADIA: Five juveniles ages 12 to 15 were arrested Monday at First Avenue 
Middle School after they allegedly beat up a classmate repeatedly over debts he 
owed them after a Jan. 3 poker game, Sgt. Steve Gilmore said. Police made the 
arrests at the school about 10:30 a.m. after the victim called for help and 
said he was afraid of being beaten again by the youths. The five were released 
to their parents pending an investigation.

CRIME; LA VERNE MINISTER'S KILLER STILL AT LARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CARLSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Verne minister was killed when he tried to stop a robbery at the Glendora 
restaurant where he ate almost all his meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hallam, 77, was drinking his customary cup of after-dinner coffee around 
7:45 p.m. at the counter next to the register last Thursday when a man burst 
into Palm's Family Restaurant and started snatching bills out of the open cash 
drawer, said Glendora police Officer Brian Summers. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostess at the counter, who had been getting change for a customer, 
screamed and Hallam rushed forward and grabbed the man from behind. The men 
struggled. Then Hallam staggered backward, bleeding from a single knife wound 
to the chest, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 As hostesses and customers tried to stanch the bleeding with a towel, the 
killer ran out the front door and fled on foot west on Laxford Street. He was 
last seen racing south on Dale Road. An ambulance rushed Hallam to Foothill 
Presbyterian Hospital, where he died about 8:30 p.m. from a wound to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in the slaying, Glendora's first since December, 
1992, Summers said. Witnesses at the restaurant described the killer as a 
6-foot-tall white or Latino man in his mid- to late 20s with a thin build, 
slicked-back black hair, a bushy mustache and wearing a brown flannel shirt 
over a white T-shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant manager Jim Balaskas, 39, stared down at his feet as he talked 
about Hallam. "He was like a grandfather to me," said Balaskas, a Greek 
immigrant who started managing Palm's about a dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been coming here since the restaurant opened. This place was like a home 
to him," Balaskas said. "He was so close to God. I remember when his wife had a 
heart attack four years ago, the doctors told him she was going to die. But he 
prayed and she lived. Now who will pray for him? Nobody could pray as strong as 
Bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Hallam, a Chicago native and a former trouble-shooter and efficiency expert 
for both the Chrysler Corp. and the Ford Motor Co., became an ordained minister 
about 15 years ago and sold all of his worldly possessions to travel around the 
United States speaking to churches, said Ann Hallam, 84, his wife of 44 years. 
The two met in Chicago and moved to California in the mid-1950s, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Hallam had coffee at Palm's almost every night, but she did not 
accompany her husband Thursday because she was too tired. She said she harbors 
no hatred for her husband's killer and has faith that she will survive the 
ordeal of her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a Christian, and the Lord provides. I am under His wings now," she said, 
a small smile wrinkling the corners of her red-rimmed eyes. Hallam will be 
buried in his home state of Illinois after a still-to-be-planned funeral 
service in Pomona, she said.

 POMONA: A 14-year-old suspected gang member was shot and killed Friday night 
at the intersection of West Muir Avenue and Rebecca Street, said Pomona Police 
Lt. Greg Hamill.A single gunshot wound to the chest killed the boy, who was 
found on the ground near the corner about 8 p.m., Hamill said. There were no

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; RUSSIAN IMMIGRANT IS SHOT IN FACE IN APPARENT 
MUGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 27-year-old Russian immigrant who may not have understood a mugger's demands 
remained in serious condition Wednesday after being shot in the face during an 
alleged robbery attempt on Ocean Park Boulevard in Santa Monica this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men were arrested Sunday morning shortly after the crime when their car 
stopped with engine trouble on the Santa Monica Freeway near Centinela 
Boulevard, said Santa Monica Police Sgt. Gary Gallinot. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the men robbed a young couple in the parking lot of Norm's 
restaurant at Lincoln Boulevard and Colorado Avenue at 4:05 a.m. and then 
attempted to rob two Russian immigrants in the 700 block of Ocean Park 
Boulevard shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two Russian victims were . . . apparently switching driving duties when 
the suspects approached and said some initial words in Spanish," Gallinot said. 
"When the two in the car did not respond, the driver's window was smashed with 
two shotgun blasts. The driver was hit but managed to slam the car into 
reverse, which led the robbers to flee." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Vladimir Sofman, suffered severe facial wounds and was undergoing 
treatment at UCLA Medical Center. His passenger, 26-year-old Yan Yukhtman, was 
unhurt, Gallinot said. Both are Los Angeles residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Armando Prado, 23, and Juan Munoz Ramirez, 21, were booked for attempted 
murder, robbery and attempted robbery after they were identified by three of 
the victims, Gallinot said. Prado and Ramirez are being held on $525,000 bail.

PASADENA TO EXPLORE WOOING OF RAMS; SPORTS: THE TEAM'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT MAY 
LEAVE ANAHEIM PROMPTS AN EFFORT TO LURE THE PRO FOOTBALL FRANCHISE TO THE ROSE 
BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CARLSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena City Council does not want the Los Angeles Rams to leave Southern 
California without first looking into playing at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the city has had a rocky relationship recently with the National 
Football League -- losing money on the 1993 Super Bowl and then failing to win 
its bid for the 1998 championship -- the council voted Tuesday to re-form the 
Super Bowl Subcommittee to investigate the possibility and costs of bringing 
the Rams to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know other cities are courting the Rams, but we have a different 
relationship with the Rams," said Councilman Chris Holden, noting that Rams 
owner Georgia Frontiere helped the city secure last year's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to put a proposal together regarding the relocation of the 
Rams to another Southern California market," he said. "I grew up on the Rams. . 
. . We want to try and retain this organization in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 1 to empower the subcommittee of Holden, council 
members William Paparian and William Thomson, and Rose Bowl Operating Co. 
chairman Al Moses to begin talks with the Rams concerning a move to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Rams announced the possibility of using the escape clause in 
their lease and moving the franchise out of Anaheim Stadium. Rams Executive 
Vice President John Shaw said no decision to leave Anaheim has been made, but 
the team is weighing the options of moving to other in-state venues or out of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams leave, the city of Anaheim would lose $400,000 a year in rent, as 
well as its cut of 7.5% of ticket revenue, 20% of luxury box revenue, and about 
50% of parking and concession revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Councilman Irv Pickler said he wants the Rams to stay but will not beg 
them to stay. The city said it will negotiate to keep the team but could not 
match extravagant offers from elsewhere, such as Baltimore's promise to build a 
$165-million stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Councilwoman Katherine Nack was the sole dissenting vote on the Rose 
Bowl plan, saying she thought the costs of wooing a professional football team 
would be prohibitive. Nack also argued that residents who live around the Rose 
Bowl need a strong voice in any decision to move the Rams to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do anything about discussing moving a professional football team into 
the Arroyo, we must include all the neighborhoods," Nack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Isaac Richard was absent from the meeting.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; DEALING IN VOLUMES OF GOODWILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tiny, obscure bookstore just inside the entrance of the Beverly Hills Public 
Library racked up thousands of dollars in sales last year -- and the volunteers 
there can't wait to give away the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of the Library, which runs the secondhand bookstore, will give the 
children's department $20,000 to buy new books and operate its annual summer 
reading program, which draws nearly 1,500 children.In addition, about $7,500 is 
earmarked for books on dance, and another $5,000 will help the library fill 
gaps in its literature, foreign language and philosophy collections, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends Bookstore opened two years ago and has thrived with the help of 65 
volunteers and customers, said bookstore chairwoman Ann Golenternek. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the store, which recently opened a second-floor annex, each week 
receives donations of 500 to 600 books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the ultimate way of recycling books," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The donations have included a first-edition copy of "The Manchurian Candidate" 
by Richard Condon, a signed edition of Tennessee Williams' "Roman Spring of 
Mrs. Stone" and Robert Waller's current best-seller "Slow Waltz at Cedar Bend." 
</P>
<P>
 First editions can sell for $100, but most of the books go for 25 cents to $7, 
Golenternek said. 
</P>
<P>
 No complaints from customers on that account. She said that people sometimes 
stand in line, waiting for the bookstore to open, and that students and senior 
citizens carry out bags of books they might be unable to afford otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely not just a Beverly Hills thing," she said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; CONSTRUCTION BEGINS ON PCC PARKING AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena City College officials broke ground Wednesday on a five-story 
2,064-space parking structure for students. 
</P>
<P>
 The $9.5-million structure at Del Mar Boulevard and Hill Avenue is scheduled 
to open next January.It will increase the number of parking spaces for students 
to 4,700, college officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lack of parking at the 26,000-student college, which serves the west San 
Gabriel Valley, has been an issue for at least 20 years, college officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure is not the college's first attempt to work out its parking 
problems. In May the City Council approved a one-year pilot project that allows 
students to park on some surrounding streets with city permits. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials also hope the new structure, equipped with security lights, 
will address safety concerns raised by students after a woman was pulled into a 
car on campus and raped Sept. 23.

 A popular community organizer was released from the hospital Tuesday after 
being treated for a gunshot wound to his right arm Saturday during a 
gang-related assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Powell, 32, works with a nonprofit agency seeking to end strife between 
black and Latino gangs.As he walked in his neighborhood near 4th and Vernon 
avenues at 9:20 p.m., Powell apparently became a victim of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police say Powell, who is black, waved at two Latino teen-agers, 
one of whom then opened fire. Powell was wounded as he ran behind a car. The 
attackers fled, said Detective Bernard Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy was waving to the guys like he waves to everybody in the neighborhood," 
said Lorenzo Merritt, director of Project Heavy West, a nonprofit youth 
diversion program for which Powell is a case manager. "Everyone knows him and 
likes him. He's the type that's always working. It's just becoming very 
dangerous."

 Police have no suspects, Rogers said.

 Mayor Robert T. Bartlett, president of the League of California Cities, this 
week praised Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed 1994-95 state budget for taking no 
additional revenues from cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson understands the cities can tolerate no further loss of revenues 
to the state, while working to provide the jobs and services to ensure 
California's recovery," said Bartlett, often an adversary of Wilson. 
</P>

 Bartlett on Monday said Wilson's proposed budget would allow cities to

THE NATURAL; LAND USE: JOE EDMISTON IS THE CONSUMMATE DEAL-MAKER, PROCURING 
THOUSANDS OF ACRES FOR THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY. HE'S ALSO 
DEVELOPED MANY ADMIRERS AND DETRACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First there were the sparse domestic budgets of the Reagan-Bush years. Then 
came the deficit-reduction fever of the Clinton Administration. It hasn't been 
a picnic for those who would acquire public parkland, not even for a 
wheeler-dealer such as Joseph T. Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the only executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, 
the state agency created in 1980 to acquire parkland in the mountains, Edmiston 
has thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he has gained a reputation as an aggressive and innovative parks 
advocate. Even his detractors acknowledge his remarkable success at expanding 
parklands during more than a decade of tightfisted government spending and 
spiraling land prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 14 years at the helm, the agency has managed -- often in jigsaw-puzzle 
fashion -- to buy, swap for or procure as donations 20,000 acres of private 
land in the spectacular mountain corridor that stretches from Griffith Park to 
Point Mugu in Ventura County. That's a land area more than half the size of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 When the task has demanded it, he has enlisted the support of powerful 
political allies, outsmarted fellow bureaucrats, struck deals with movie stars 
and real estate developers and charmed community and environmental leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe's record of accomplishment speaks for itself," said Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City), a longtime ally who as a state legislator led the effort to 
establish the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, hold a different view. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston is "more interested in personal power than in conservation," declared 
Mary Weisbrock, whose group, Save Open Space, finds him too quick to compromise 
with developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others say he can be ruthless and vindictive with those who dare cross 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe has a difficult time separating professional considerations from his own 
personal feelings," said Peter Ireland, who was forced out of his job at the 
agency last year after butting heads with Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearded, baritone-voiced and armed with a lightning wit, Edmiston's powerful 
persona and zeal for deal-making has made him, to friend and foe alike, 
virtually indistinguishable from the agency he heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe Edmiston is the conservancy," said Jerry Daniel, the agency's board 
chairman. "Without Joe I sincerely believe that the organization would crumble 
to pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Edmiston is the conservancy's key player as the agency 
prepares to take on two potential make-or-break challenges this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, voters will decide the fate of a $2-billion statewide bond initiative 
that would generate $132 million for the conservancy and its affiliates. It is 
no coincidence that the measure, sponsored by the California Planning and 
Conservation League, treats the conservancy generously. Edmiston helped draft 
it, as he did a similar measure sponsored by the same group and approved by 
voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's measure, known by the acronym CALPAW, would also make the agency 
permanently eligible to receive money from the state's General Fund and 
undertake land acquisition projects as far afield as the Whittier Hills and San 
Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 While the June vote represents a potential boon for the conservancy, a second 
test threatens to be the agency's bane: Opponents in the state Legislature are 
pushing proposals to rein in the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawmakers, led by state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), object to 
the agency's tactics, particularly its controversial attempt to use eminent 
domain to wrest 245 acres in the heart of the mountains from Soka University. 
</P>
<P>
 They are considering legislation to force the conservancy to reimburse state 
bond funds with the money it gets for transferring parkland to the federal 
government, no small change considering the agency has reaped $35 million from 
the transfer of about 5,000 acres to the National Park Service in little more 
than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy supporters were stunned last month when state Sen. Dan 
McCorquodale (D-Modesto), long counted among the agency's friends, joined 
Wright in criticizing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are constantly looking at reinventing government, and at some point you 
may get reinvented," McCorquodale warned during a Senate oversight committee 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the storm is Edmiston, 44, who shrugs off such attacks by 
saying they come with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the Sgt. York in the Jeep," he said. "I provide a nice wide target to 
shoot at." 
</P>
<P>
 A self-proclaimed workaholic who wears a wrist calculator to figure per-acre 
land prices, Edmiston has literally wheeled and dealed all over the Santa 
Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1989, he managed to torpedo an effort by the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts to put a garbage dump in scenic Towsley Canyon near Santa 
Clarita, even though the landfill agency had already acquired an option on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston bought two small parcels, including one near the mouth of the canyon 
that provided the only feasible truck route between the landfill site and the 
Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston's critics, however, say his deal-making often comes at the 
environment's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many of his deals the mountains are clearly the loser," said Siegfried 
Othmer, a Sherman Oaks activist who accuses Edmiston of doing the bidding of 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Othmer cites two recent transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Calabasas, the conservancy last year endorsed a luxury housing development 
on 938 acres after the developer, Micor Venture, agreed to cluster the 250 
houses it hopes to build on the property and set aside nearly 700 acres of the 
tract as public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say it was a Faustian bargain, noting that the houses were to be 
built in a pristine canyon that is an important wildlife habitat. They have 
filed suit to block the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Also controversial was the conservancy's purchase last year of the 2,308-acre 
Jordan Ranch in Ventura County from entertainer Bob Hope. Part of a complicated 
land swap, it ranks as the conservancy's single largest land acquisition ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the agency stands to acquire another 7,000 acres in the mountains 
owned by Hope and the Ahmanson Land Co. But the rest of the deal hinges on 
whether Ahmanson and its partners proceed with plans to develop a $1-billion 
mini-city for 8,600 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In promoting the Hope land swap and the Calabasas development, Edmiston 
switched hats and acted as a lobbyist for the builders before regulatory 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes no apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk to developers because they're the ones who own the land," he said. "If 
you aren't willing to be pragmatic, you're nowhere in (the parks procurement) 
business, which some people have a difficult time understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston is proud of the Bob Hope deal, commemorated by the deed to Jordan 
Ranch framed on his Malibu office wall. As befits a man who sees parkland 
preservation in strategic terms, his office bookshelves are crammed with 
volumes dealing with the tactics and strategy of warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview, Ruth Kilday, the head of the Mountains Conservancy 
Foundation, which works closely with the conservancy, stopped by to deliver a 
framed photo as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 The photograph depicts Edmiston's latest triumph, Barbra Streisand's 24-acre 
Malibu estate, which the entertainer recently donated to the conservancy for 
use as a conservation research center. 
</P>
<P>
 But even such a gift carries a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's Ramirez Canyon neighbors have already begun to fret about the 
traffic the center may generate. Edmiston has suggested a road could be built 
to bypass that enclave, a notion that hasn't played well with some 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also complain that Edmiston oversteps his authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month he was accused of lobbying against the appointment of 
Ireland, his former subordinate, as Los Angeles' representative to the 
conservancy board. Despite an early overture to Ireland, Mayor Richard Riordan 
appointed actor Ed Begley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston declined to comment on the Ireland matter.  
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston lives in Santa Monica with his wife, Pepper, and their seven 
children. His wife, the founder of a camp program for children, is the daughter 
of Beverly Hills Mayor Max Salter. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in East Los Angeles, an only child whose parents exhibited a keen 
interest in local politics and environmental causes. His father, an engineer 
who invented a machine used in canning fruit, and his mother, whom he described 
as an "activist housewife," shared a passion for the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston was a student at West Los Angeles School of Law in the early 1970s 
when he realized he wanted to be a conservationist. He had earlier graduated 
from USC, which he attended on a debate scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 He abandoned law school, at age 24, when he was offered a $500-a-month job as 
a Sierra Club lobbyist in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job was to preach to the heathen(s)," he said of his four years spent 
promoting environmental legislation, including the bill that established the 
California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1977 he had caught the attention of then-Gov. Jerry Brown, who appointed 
him to the Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Planning Commission, the 
conservancy's forerunner. The post made him the logical choice for his current 
job. He earns $65,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His agency works closely with the National Park Service and the state park 
system to acquire parkland. It receives little directly from the state -- less 
than $150,000 this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither has it been able to count on much help from the federal government. 
For several years in the early 1980s the Reagan Administration eliminated 
acquisition funds for local parks. This year, the agency's administrative 
budget, including salaries for its 11-member staff, is $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the conservancy finances the purchase of a given piece of parkland, 
sells it to state parks or to the federal government for inclusion in the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and uses the proceeds to obtain more 
land. It does so through a variety of innovative means, which observers credit 
largely to Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency often intervenes to snatch up land as it comes on the market, 
without waiting for the federal government to complete the often cumbersome 
process of appropriating money. Park enthusiasts say the practice has preserved 
thousands of acres that may have fallen to development. 
</P>
<P>
 But with deficit-cutting the watchword these days in Washington, there are few 
federal dollars to go around. For the current fiscal year, the Clinton 
Administration allocated $4.5 million for land acquisition in the Santa 
Monicas, compared to $11.5 million during the last year of the Bush presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the lion's share of the conservancy's money -- nearly $100 
million in all -- has come from a series of voter-approved state and local bond 
measures. Proposition 117, commonly known as the Mountain Lion Initiative, 
netted the agency $50 million in 1990, while Proposition A, approved by Los 
Angeles County voters in 1992, brought in another $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 To subsidize the meager sum provided directly by the state for staff and 
office expenses, the conservancy must rely on interest it earns from unspent 
bond money. As a result, it seems almost always strapped for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 That could change in a hurry with passage of the June ballot measure. The 
measure would provide $132 million, more than doubling the bond funds the 
agency and its affiliates have received to date. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy's legislative problems may not be solved as easily. Supporters 
insist that the agency's troubles with lawmakers stem from the dispute over 
Tokyo-based Soka University's property. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks enthusiasts, including National Park Service officials, have long 
coveted the 245-acre campus -- on the site of the former King Gillette Ranch -- 
as the ideal spot for a visitor center and park headquarters for the national 
recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy, through one of its affiliated agencies, took the 
unprecedented step of instituting condemnation proceedings last year after the 
university rejected a bid to buy the property for more than $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka, which operates a language school for about 100 international students at 
the site, wants to build a 3,400-student liberal arts college there. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks enthusiasts view the site, located in a valley at the foot of dramatic 
peaks in the Santa Monicas, as vital to the decades-long effort to piece 
together an expansive mountain park. 
</P>
<P>
 The university, meanwhile, has hired powerful lobbyists to protect its 
interests in Washington and Sacramento, with impressive results. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka's influence could be seen in this year's federal appropriation for Santa 
Monica Mountains land acquisition. The measure's language precluded any of the 
funds being used to procure the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that Soka might throw its considerable weight behind a campaign to 
defeat the measure, sponsors of the June ballot initiative also inserted a 
provision to restrict the conservancy from using any of the proceeds to buy 
Soka property. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's backers, meanwhile, say they expect a full-scale assault in the 
Legislature this year from lawmakers sympathetic to Soka to either abolish or 
cripple the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soka is a very powerful organization with lots of money that it spends in 
abundance in lobbying in Washington and Sacramento," said Assemblyman Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Brentwood), a close friend of Edmiston. "I think it poses a grave 
threat to the conservancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan denies that the university is out to get the 
conservancy, although he does not disguise his ire at the agency and its 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe Edmiston fancies himself as the William Mulholland of the 1990s," Ourvan 
said. "But where Mulholland brought water as an essential resource to Southern 
California, Edmiston's mission is a park headquarters, which is hardly vital to 
people of the region." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston, who realizes the months ahead may be the bumpiest yet for his 
agency, manages to project an appearance of calm. Some associates, however, 
speculate he may have tired of the job and would welcome a change. He may have 
signaled as much last year, when he applied -- unsuccessfully -- to be director 
of the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston, uncomfortable discussing his personal ambitions, said he wishes he 
had gotten the park service post. He insists, however, that he is not looking 
to bail out of the conservancy as it enters a politically turbulent period. "I 
love what I do." Joe Edmiston's Mountain Kingdom 
</P>
<P>
 Executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy since 1980, has 
led the agency's effort to create a comprehensive park system in the Santa 
Monicas. These are among the conservancy's key acquisition projects.

APPOINTMENT: CLINTON SELECTION CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What would motivate President Clinton's transportation secretary to appoint a 
professional lobbyist, outspoken on key issues, to assist the Federal Highway 
Administrator? What kind of politics is behind the recent appointment of Evelyn 
Fierro, a longtime vocal opponent to the 710 Freeway extension, to a key 
position within the agency that will decide on the fate of the project? 
</P>
<P>
 My immediate reaction was disgust when I first read of the appointment in the 
Times San Gabriel Valley Section on Sunday, Dec. 26; but disgust turned to 
disbelief after thinking it over for a few hours.One would question the 
political wisdom of such an obvious blunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress must urge the President to seek a reversal of the appointment or face 
redress by the constituency.

POLITICS: MOTION FOLLOW-UP BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Thursday, Dec. 30 edition of the San Gabriel Valley Section, Mr. Bob 
Cook had published a letter criticizing me for lack of follow-up with respect 
to a motion that directed our city manager to inform the public of city tax 
exemptions as they relate to income levels. Mr. Cook published this same letter 
in two other local papers in recent weeks and was promptly taken to task by the 
mayor and city manager as well as myself for the false information presented as 
well as the cheap shot. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, the city manager responded immediately to the motion of 
informing the public by publishing on the first page of the South Pasadena 
Review on July 28, 1993, one week after the council meeting in question.Due to 
review deadlines, he was composing the day after the council meeting. Can't get 
much better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, it's quite obvious from the above that no follow-up was required; and 
if there were, it would be the responsibility of each council member to follow 
up, not just the member who made the motion. We all voted positively on it. 
</P>
<P>
 And third, the city completed its legal and moral obligations by publishing 
the information. It does not and should not have to communicate to the public 
via notices in the water bill as the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Cook attends every council meeting and is not shy about taking up council 
time asking questions about almost every agenda item, and usually has something 
to say during the non-agenda public comment period. Not once during the last 
five months has he inquired about this subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Farfsing (city manager) did his job. No follow-up by me or anyone else was 
required.

710 FREEWAY: RIGHTS AND WRONGS ON THE ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a member of the 710 Mitigation Advisory Committee, a former mayor and 
councilman in the city of Alhambra, my solution to the problem is very simple. 
Just issue different color automotive license plates for people of South 
Pasadena. If they are found on any other cities' streets or freeways, they 
would be arrested. The rest of us would, of course, agree not to drive on their 
streets and not to push for the completion of the freeway. South Pasadena then 
would not be disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 I am, of course, being facetious to show the absurdity of the argument that 
South Pasadena has some divine right that the rest of us do not possess. After 
attending many meetings regarding this problem, I am convinced that no more 
than 200 zealots are truly against the freeway completion. The rest of the 
people in South Pasadena just go along with the party line that the city of 
South Pasadena will be destroyed if a freeway is built through their city. 
</P>
<P>
 No other city in Southern California has been destroyed by a freeway through 
it. Just look at South Pasadena neighbors La Canada-Flintridge, Pasadena, 
Alhambra, Monterey Park, Los Angeles, San Gabriel, Arcadia, etc., etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Our wise forefathers recognized the problem that a few negative people could 
usurp the rights of many, so they gave government the right of condemnation 
(i.e. the right of the taking of private property for public use by the payment 
of just compensation). Without that right, can you imagine what our society 
would be like? There would be no streets, schools, libraries, hospitals, parks, 
etc. No matter what the project is, someone is going to be against it as 
someone is always inconvenienced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times wrongly hints that a partial solution is possible by extending the 
freeway a quarter-mile to Mission Road in Alhambra as proposed by South 
Pasadena's so-called "Low Build" proposal. This extension of a quarter-mile 
would only divert the problem not only to Alhambra residential areas, but to El 
Sereno's as well (the very area South Pasadena claims it wants to help). The 
effect on El Sereno residential areas would be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 A solution much more to the liking of Alhambra and El Sereno would be the 
extension of the freeway to Huntington Drive. South Pasadena, of course, would 
never accept this because the traffic would now dump at its doorstep instead of 
Alhambra's. 
</P>
<P>
 Read the Mitigation Report. You would find that the freeway through South 
Pasadena would only temporarily affect the few in the Freeway Right of Way, but 
would also be a real benefit not only to South Pasadena neighbors, but the 
majority of the people in South Pasadena as well.

STYLE; SHOE STORE TAPS INTO HAPPIER DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before high-tech Air Jordans and disposable dress shoes danced onto the 
scene, feet dressed differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoes had sole, not to mention rugged double stitching and hand-carved leather 
uppers. People wore the same comfortable pair year after year and threw them 
out only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Now those same chubby, rock-solid shoes of the '40s and '50s are making a 
comeback of sorts at 7605 1/2 Beverly Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The trendy little shop in West Los Angeles, named Re-Mix, specializes in shoes 
from yesteryear, including wingtips, cap toes, two-tone Spectators and a risque 
assortment of pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoes are not knock-offs of originals nor refurbished "antiques." Rather, 
say the store's owners, Paul Glynn and Phil Heath, they are "dead stock," brand 
new originals painstakingly culled from warehouses and other secret sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to snoop around and talk to people," said Glynn, declining to 
specify his source for the shoes. "There's lot of travel, lots of small towns, 
cheap hotels and (bad) food." 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since it opened, Re-Mix has given Glynn and Heath a way to indulge 
their passion for fashion and to capitalize on the craze for all things retro. 
</P>
<P>
 The store's clientele ranges from style-driven hip-hoppers to young attorneys 
to musicians George Clinton and Lenny Kravitz, and actors Kim Basinger, Laura 
Dern, Carrie Fisher and Jeff Goldbloom, according to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger customers tend to see the shoes as a fashion statement, mixing and 
matching Buster Brown-style little boys' shoes or orthopedically correct "Red 
Cross" granny shoes with long dresses, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other patrons are drawn to the craftsmanship rarely found in modern models. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like the quality, the uniqueness, the details that they just don't do 
anymore," Heath said. "Manufacturers don't even spend any time promoting those 
aspects. It's buy it, wear it, throw it away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a thing about going back to a simpler, sturdier time when 
shoes were these things you lived with." 
</P>
<P>
 The shoes cost between $20 and $100, and while they can make great costume 
accessories, that's not the main reason people buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our customers buy them as everyday wear," Heath said. "It's not just 
something you buy as a goof." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Current stock includes sturdy 1940s-era work boots, Red Ball Express sneakers 
and a pair of 1960s platforms purportedly made of marijuana hemp. There's also 
a pair of "spade shoes," just the thing to go with your zoot suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The store, decorated with life-size, hand-tinted posters of burlesque dancers 
and bathed in the soft sounds of jazz, sells 50-year-old sweaters and dungarees 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 It also serves as something of an art gallery, displaying funky furniture and 
other odds and ends from artists Ruben Ramirez, Jim Reva, Jon Boc and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the odder -- and less politically correct -- items for sale are 
alligator and ostrich-skin handbags and sea turtle shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 But not to worry. The animals gave their lives for fashion decades before 
legislation was enacted to protect them.

BUILDINGS: JUDGE'S RULING ON RAZING OF OLD HOME RAISES SOME QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is in response to the Dec. 19 article "Judge Rules Razing of Old Home Was 
Illegal" regarding the city of Glendora razing an old house for a parking lot. 
I agree with City Manager Art Cook that the judge changed her mind for 
political reasons.At least she had the good judgment not to require the city to 
rebuild the house. It seems that any "cause" can get courts to rule in their 
favor by pursuing an issue long enough to persuade a judge or to appeal enough 
times to find some judge that will give them a favorable ruling. It also 
appears that once that happens it is virtually impossible to get it reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Why must every old building have some historical significance? This particular 
building sounded like it should have been razed, and I am quite sure there are 
other buildings of the same circa and architectural design in the residential 
areas of Glendora and would not be in the way of progress. But then I guess the 
poor property owner would have to deal with the "cause" if he wanted to do 
something to his property. It's too bad that these causes can't be made to 
purchase these properties and be responsible for their upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does the Glendora Preservation Foundation think the city should be 
responsible for their legal fees? If the city won the case I think the city 
should be able to collect their legal fees from the foundation. If this type of 
thing were possible it would certainly stop a lot of frivolous lawsuits.

 " I'm 16. I just got a ticket for going 65 on the freeway. Do I have to go to 
court or can I pay by mail? My dad will be so mad; do I have to tell him? "  
</P>
<P>
 No way out.Unlike adults who get tickets and can just mail in the bail amount, 
most kids in L.A. County have to show up for a hearing with parents in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't show up with your folks at the special traffic school for minors, 
there's no way to avoid serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 All traffic tickets are reported to the state Department of Motor Vehicles, 
which sends a letter to your parents, or whomever signed your license, telling 
you that in two days your license will be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 But once you get past that hump, it's not so bad. The usual fine for a first 
moving violation is around $49, and there is also a $24 state-imposed 
administrative fee. If the money is a problem, they'll usually allow community 
service instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better, if you haven't been to traffic school in the past 18 months, the 
court will let you attend. It takes two Saturday afternoons and costs from $25 
to $45 in addition to your fine. But the good news is that once you attend -- 
you have to do it within 60 days of your court hearing -- the case is dismissed 
and doesn't show up on your public record. That means no increase in your 
insurance premium, which otherwise could go up by several hundred dollars a 
year.

JOBS: DEFINING THE ROLE OF TEACHERS IN TODAY'S SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am curious about Mr. K. Dellinger's credentials (letter Jan. 6 re: M. 
Yarber's column Dec. 30) concerning his ability to define what a professional 
is. Since when does being a member of a union preclude one from being a 
professional? If private parties, rather than school districts, had to pay us, 
I'm sure LAUSD educators would regain their recent 10% pay cut and then 
some.Since Mr. Dellinger proposes that only (professionals) such as doctors, 
lawyers, and CPAs are real professionals, does he mean to infer that those 
illustrious professionals were educated by non-professionals? What makes those 
true professionals have greater value than teachers who have just as much (if 
not more) education and (I can assure you after 10 years' experience teaching 
in South-Central L.A.) an equal or greater workload? 
</P>
<P>
 Since Mr. Dellinger's assumption is that women drop out of the work force (in) 
mid-career or work limited schedules, his inference would appear to be that 
women aren't as dedicated to their careers as men who have real professional 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 What classroom has he been in lately in which is evidenced a "watered -- down, 
pablum-fed curricula"? Certainly not mine. So our agenda is our "own 
entrenchment?" Funny, because we've always worked our tails off to give our 
students the best education and guidance in the midst of a society comprised of 
people like him who depreciate our efforts. We would welcome him gladly into 
our classrooms anytime, so he can view real professional female teachers who 
care about kids and America's future and have done this full time for decades.

CLASS NOTES: A PRIMER ON CORRESPONDENCE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Mary Laine Yarber teaches English 
at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I get a lot of phone calls and letters from readers curious about 
correspondence courses. Most want to know if such courses are "real," and how 
to tell the legitimate ones from the scams. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are some bad apples in the bunch, many schools offering 
correspondence programs are worthwhile and credible. Indeed, the last couple of 
decades have brought a sharp increase in the number of such schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Many educational goals can be accomplished through the mail. You can, for 
example, take courses on nearly any subject found on a regular campus. You can 
also earn various professional certifications and all types of college degrees 
-- from the two-year associate's degree to a doctorate or law degree. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, home study takes many forms. The most common is correspondence -- the 
student receives study materials, assignments and tests in the mail from a 
particular college or school, then sends back the completed work to be graded. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to recent technology, however, many home study programs now use more 
interesting methods. Teaching courses via cable TV hookup or by videotape has 
become popular. So has using computer software and communicating with the 
school from home with a computer modem. 
</P>
<P>
 Home study programs generally entail admission requirements that are less 
harsh and complicated than those of traditional schools; many don't even 
require the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or other entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The master's program offered by California State University at Dominguez Hills 
in Carson is fairly typical of credible correspondence education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State program offers a master's in five subjects, and all work is done 
through home study (projects, papers, and a thesis or creative project). 
Instructors guide students by telephone, mail and cassette, and grading is 
based largely on written assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State requires at least 30 hours for the master's; a full-time student can 
complete it in a year or so. And, since Cal State is a public university, the 
course of study is about as inexpensive as they come (about $1,500 for the 
whole program). Also important: Cal State schools are well-respected and 
accredited, and Dominguez Hills' correspondence program has been in operation 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're interested in a correspondence course or degree, bear in mind that 
not all programs are like Cal State's. Be sure to ask questions before 
enrolling to find the program that's right for you. 
</P>
<P>
 First, ask the school's representative how long the school has existed. Of 
course, it's possible that a new school may be excellent, but a fairly decent 
history is usually preferable. 
</P>
<P>
 Find out about the instructors' backgrounds too. Do they have degrees, 
specialized training or job experience in the subjects they'll be teaching? 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure you find out all the required courses and costs, to avoid surprises 
down the road. Get that in writing too; any school that won't provide a written 
course of study and payment plan should be pulled from your pool right away. 
</P>
<P>
 For a list of school accreditation agencies, write to the Council on 
Postsecondary Accreditation, 1 Dupont Circle North, Suite 760, Washington, D.C. 
20036, or the Department of Education, Division of Eligibility and Agency 
Evaluation, Washington, D.C. 20202. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reliable accreditation agency for vocational schools and 
degree-by-mail schools nationwide is the National Home Study Council, at 1601 
18th Street Northwest, Washington, D.C. 20009.

EDUCATION: GRADES DON'T MEASURE SELF-WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Mary Laine Yarber teaches English 
at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The news your child's school sends you via the regular report card may be good 
or bad. Regardless, it is important for parents to respond in nurturing, 
constructive ways. 
</P>
<P>
 First, bear in mind something that is trite but true: Grades measure a child's 
performance in a subject; they do not measure the child's worth. An F in 
English does not make your child a bad person; it does mean, though, that he or 
she needs some help. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's self-esteem is deeply affected by their grades, whether or not they 
admit it. They need to hear that grades do not determine how lovable they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Look over the report card with your child and discuss each grade and class 
separately.  
</P>
<P>
 If it is a good grade, encourage your son or daughter to talk about what 
helped him or her to do so well. Are there study habits that could be applied 
to classes where the grade is not so pretty? 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents like to award money for good grades, but I think the practice 
tends to reduce learning to a dash for cash. Your child will deal with that 
more than enough later in life, so try some other rewards now. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, give the child another learning opportunity, such as a visit to 
the Griffith Park Observatory (they've got unbeatable hands-on gadgets) or the 
La Brea Tar Pits. Or consider giving a bookstore gift certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Coping with poor grades, of course, is more difficult. My sense is that 
scolding and punishing generally do not work; they only add to the student's 
shame and are likely to make your child even more negative about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, ask your child what he or she thinks the problem may be, then call 
the teacher for an additional diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you spot the problem, don't just say, "Do better next time." You've got 
to show how to do better. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher is your best source of strategies for improvement, but let the 
student offer some ideas, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the remedy is as simple as budgeting time more wisely, or remembering to 
write down due dates in a pocket calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutoring is also helpful in some cases. See if the teacher is available. At 
some high schools, members of the honor society also offer free help. Older 
tutors can be found through the employment offices of nearby colleges and 
universities, but they can be expensive -- $10 to $25 an hour in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
 As your child improves, it is helpful to monitor progress by contacting the 
teacher once a week. Most schools offer parents written reports, usually 
available through the counseling office. Calling the teacher may be easier, 
depending on the teacher's schedule and access to phones. Such contact lets you 
know which assignments are due when and can often help you catch grades before 
they fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if all other possible remedies fail, you may have to accept that 
perhaps your son or daughter can't do much better in a particular subject. To 
offset that, help him or her to discover and sharpen a talent or subject that 
comes more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 As an English teacher, I am frequently told by parents that a child is a 
gifted writer, destined for fame, even when it is all the child can do to form 
a coherent paragraph. Reality can be upsetting, but in the end, it is the best 
approach for your child's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Few children can do well in every subject, but by analyzing the report card 
wisely, you can help your child make his or her best effort.

FOR PARENTS; FAMILY OUTING; JPL OFFERS GUIDED TOUR THROUGH OUTER SPACE 
</P>

 "Space . . . is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely 
mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road 
to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space." -- Douglas Adams, "The 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" 
</P>
<P>
 Or to put it another way, it takes 30 years for a spacecraft traveling at 
50,000 miles per hour to leave our solar system. And another 300,000 years to 
reach the nearest star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to look at the faces of the people as I tell them about it," said Kay 
Van Lepp, a public services representative at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Van Lepp's duties is giving tours of the facility, which is open to the 
public at irregular intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can relate to time," Van Lepp said, and often to speed, but it is 
still hard for most people to relate to the immensity of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is part of Van Lepp's job. While scientists and engineers design and 
build the robotic spacecraft that explore our solar system, Van Lepp tries to 
help schoolchildren, senior citizens and everyone else understand what JPL 
does, and why it is important to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour begins with a multimedia presentation called "Welcome to Outer Space" 
in an auditorium that contains a life-size replica of a Voyager spacecraft, 
which is surprisingly small for something that has been crossing the solar 
system since 1977 and is still sending signals back to earth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spacecraft museum in the next room is the much larger life-size model 
of Galileo, which currently is working its way toward Jupiter to study its 
moons. Launched from the space shuttle in October, 1989, it won't reach Jupiter 
until early December, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop is the mission control center where Galileo, Voyagers I and II, and 
Magellan, which is mapping Venus, are monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Lepp said that Magellan was supposed to work only two years, but it has 
been on the job four years now and is still working. Mission control even 
managed to change the craft's orbit so it can better scan the planet's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding is running out soon for the Magellan project, however, and it will be 
turned off sometime this year, Van Lepp said sadly. The Details 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Road Drive, on border of Pasadena 
and La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Two-hour tours scheduled irregularly on weekdays, usually at 10 a.m. or 
1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Who: All ages are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 How much: Free. 
</P>
<P>

 Palisades High will celebrate the 25th anniversary of its City Section 
basketball championship team during halftime of a Jan. 21 home game against 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Marlowe, captain of the U.S. gold medal volleyball team in the 1984 
Olympics, and 12 other Dolphin players from the championship basketball team, 
will be reunited to pay tribute to A.J. (Jerry) Marvin Jr., who coached at the 
school from 1961 to 1991. The gym will be renamed "Marvin Gardens" in his 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected to attend are former starters Don Shaw, Ken Baker, Kris Jamtaas, 
Doug King, and reserves Jeff Jacobs and Jay Hanseth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the championship game, the Dolphins, led by Marlowe, beat Reseda, 85-57, to 
avenge an earlier loss to the Regents and complete a 21-1 season. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having an outstanding basketball team, the Dolphins featured 
seven players who later became volleyball stars in college, including 
professionals Marlowe and Hanseth. NEW COACH 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Taylor was officially named football coach at Santa Monica College on 
Monday, becoming the school's first black football coach. He replaces Owen 
Hahn, who resigned two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor has been a full-time physical education teacher and assistant football 
coach at Santa Monica since 1984. He also has been an assistant at North 
Carolina A & T, L.A. Southwest and L.A. City. He was an all-state running back 
at Jonathon Law High in Miford, Conn., competed collegiately at Allan Hancock 
College in Santa Maria and Central Connecticut State, and played 
semi-professionally with the Los Angeles Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has paid his dues and worked hard as an assistant in the program," 
Athletic Director Avie Bridges said. "He deserves an opportunity to direct our 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very deserving of the position and has a great rapport with the 
athletes." FAMILY TRADITION 
</P>
<P>
 Malika Edmondson, 14, a freshman at St. Bernard who set a national age-group 
record of 54.7 seconds in the 400-meter sprint last summer, will make her high 
school debut at the 35th annual Sunkist Invitational indoor track meet on Feb. 
19 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmondson is the daughter of Barbara Ferrell, the USC women's track coach and 
100-meter silver medalist at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, and Warren 
Edmondson, the former NCAA 100-meter champion at UCLA. HIS TIME HAS COME 
</P>
<P>
 Kejuan Woods made the shot of the game to help Crossroads beat Brentwood, 
60-59, Saturday in a Delphic League opening game. But Roadrunner point guard 
Baron Davis made the comment of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 With about two minutes left, Davis asked Roadrunner Coach Daryl Roper, "Can I 
go off now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roper, who did not take his 5-foot-6 guard seriously, responded, "Sure. Why 
not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Davis then proceeded to score the Roadrunners' next seven points on a layup, a 
three-point shot and a 15-foot jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods scored off a rebound and was fouled with two seconds left. He made the 
free throw to win the game. Crossroads (6-6, 1-0 in league) has won three 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Roper, however, was still laughing Monday when he retold the Davis story. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a prime-time player who loves the pressure," Roper said. "But I'm not 
sure what he was waiting for." NOT THEIR BEST SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard and Palisades had a hard time scoring points last week and it 
wasn't because their opponents were playing great defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings had a school-record low 43 points in a 43-13 victory over Alemany 
Friday in a Mission League game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (8-5, 2-2) led 7-5 after the first quarter and 12-6 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to keep kicking my assistant to keep him awake," St. Bernard Coach Jim 
McClune said. "It was a normal game -- they didn't stall -- but neither team 
could shoot very well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings are averaging 62 points a game, the lowest point total since 
McClune became coach in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades had a season-low point total on Friday in a 43-29 loss to Fairfax in 
a Coastal Conference game. The Dolphins (10-5) attempted only 24 shots and had 
22 turnovers. They also missed 12 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins scored only 14 points in the second half after trailing, 21-18, 
at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense was pretty good," Palisades Coach James Paleno said. "We turned 
the ball over one too many times and missed our foul shots." ONE-MAN SHOW 
</P>
<P>
 Windward (2-7) was trailing Buckley, 30-25, late in the fourth quarter of a 
Liberty League game Friday. Then sophomore guard Eric Groman scored two 
three-point baskets to give the Wildcats a 31-30 win. Groman, who is averaging 
11 points, scored a career-high 25 points and made five of six shots in the 
second half. The victory was Windward's first league win in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely was the greatest shooting performance I've ever seen by a 
Windward player," fourth-year Wildcat Coach Ken Asher said. "And we're out of 
last place for the first time since I don't know when." CAUGHT IN A TRAP 
</P>
<P>
 In its Coastal Conference opener Friday at Manual Arts, Venice was held to 
only two first-quarter points by the Toilers' trapping zone defense and went on 
to lose, 69-48. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came out like men and we played like boys," Venice Coach Thermon Moore 
said. "We knew exactly what they were going to do. But their defense was too 
strong and we didn't execute well offensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Gondolier guard Rasheed Hazzard had 18 points in the loss. BIG IMPROVEMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Free-throw shooting paid dividends when the Venice girls' team overwhelmed Los 
Angeles, 89-32, in its Coastal Conference opener Friday. Venice shot 66.7% from 
the line in making 16 free-throws, an improvement from the previous week when 
the Gondoliers missed 16 of 21 attempts in a 56-43 loss to Condell Park of 
Bankstown, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really showed what we had to work on," Venice assistant Cathy Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior center Jamila Locke led the Gondoliers with 17 points and junior guard 
Yuriko Jung and senior guard Carly Furuno added 15 and 14. DOUBLE DOUBLES 
</P>
<P>
 One bright spot for Hollywood (1-6, 0-4 in Northern Conference) has been the 
play of 5-foot-9 senior guard Mishal Ortiz, who had 15 points and 15 rebounds 
in a 44-41 loss to Lincoln on Friday. Sheik Coach Ken Hardee praises her 
quickness and aggressiveness. Ortiz is averaging 10.7 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm giving her more responsibility and she's playing with more confidence," 
Hardee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as a team, that was the best we've played all year even though we only 
shot around 25%. We just have to work on getting it in at a higher clip." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, which has won only four conference games in the past three years, 
plays at Eagle Rock on Friday. WELCOME BACK CARTER 
</P>
<P>
 Marlborough (12-4) 6-foot-1 senior center Kim Carter returned from an ankle 
injury last week and scored 18 points in a 43-32 nonleague win over Campbell 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had eleven rebounds on Friday in a 42-36 victory over Immaculate Heart 
in a Sunshine League opener. In that game, 5-11 senior Deborah Sternlight lead 
Marlborough with 18 points and 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sternlight and Carter, Coach John Ferrante likes the Mustangs' chances in 
league, even against defending champion Notre Dame Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Kim returning, we should be able to play with anybody," he said. "Even 
with Notre Dame having (Jenny) Hatch and (Taryn) Reynolds, our size should keep 
us in any games." 
</P>
<P>
 Marlborough will play host to Notre Dame on Jan. 27. ALAN OTA and SEAN WATERS

KERRIGAN CASE: A BIZARRE TWIST; FIGURE SKATING: FBI PROBE FOCUSES ON HUSBAND 
AND BODYGUARD OF COMPETITOR TONYA HARDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bizarre twist to the Nancy Kerrigan attack, federal authorities Wednesday 
focused on allegations involving the husband and bodyguard of Tonya Harding, 
the U.S. national figure skating champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, from Portland, Ore., abruptly canceled an appearance in Fairfax, Va., 
today; and Dewey Blanton, a spokesman for Kerrigan, said the FBI told the 
skater's family there is an impending development. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit police called a news conference, then kept reporters waiting 
throughout Wednesday night. Authorities had planned to intercept Harding's 
husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard, Shawn Eric Eckardt, en route to 
Virginia, at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, then make an announcement, sources said. 
When the skater and the two men failed to show, FBI agents in Oregon were asked 
to help find them, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, 24, of Stoneham, Mass., was struck on the knee with a blunt 
instrument by an unknown assailant after practice last Thursday at the U.S. 
Figure Skating Championships in Detroit. The assailant severely bruised 
Kerrigan's right leg, forcing her to withdraw from the competition. The man 
escaped by fleeing past reporters and Kerrigan's family members, then breaking 
through a door window at Cobo Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Committee of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. selected Kerrigan 
to the Olympics team despite missing the trials, along with Harding, who won 
the U.S. championship in Detroit. The Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, 
are scheduled for Feb. 12-27. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was first thought to be the act of a crazed fan, reports surfaced 
Monday night that the FBI was investigating the possibility that Harding's 
husband and bodyguard were involved in arranging the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A Portland minister went to the FBI after hearing a tape recording in which 
the two men allegedly spoke with a "hit man" from Arizona about attacking 
Kerrigan, the Portland Oregonian reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly acknowledged that he was interviewed by the FBI earlier this week but 
denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's illegal," he told the Oregonian. "I wouldn't do that. I have more 
faith in my wife than to bump off her competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt called the allegations absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I would never get involved in anything like that," he said. "I 
mean, that's not something I could do or allow." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, 23, has denied any link to the attack, saying she felt cheated of the 
chance to compete against Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be a true crown until I face Nancy, and that will be at the 
Olympics," Harding told reporters. "And let me tell you, I'm going to whip her 
butt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it. I mean, why does someone want to discredit me. I just 
don't understand. It's ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding reportedly was the target of a death threat last fall that prevented 
her from competing at the Northwest Pacific Championships in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has had marital problems with Gillooly, 26, who works in a state 
Liquor Control Commission warehouse. The couple, married in 1990, started 
divorce proceedings last summer, then reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, Harding filed a report with Clackamas County Sheriff's Department, 
accusing Gillooly of assault. No arrest was made, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a petition for a restraining order against Gillooly, filed two days after 
the divorce petition, Harding claimed he had wrenched her arm and wrist, pulled 
her hair and shoved her.

POWER PLAY PAYS OFF AS KINGS BEAT WHALERS; HOCKEY: L.A. GOES FOUR FOR EIGHT 
WITH HARTFORD SHORT-HANDED. ROBITAILLE, GRETZKY EACH GET FOUR POINTS IN 6-4 
VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If Wayne Gretzky's so-called "office" is behind the net, then Luc Robitaille's 
favorite place to work is next to the crease. 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille and Gretzky combined for eight points, and the Kings were 
impressive on the power play in their 6-4 victory over the Hartford Whalers 
Wednesday. Gretzky's first goal, at 10:34 of the first period, was his 2,400th 
NHL point. 
</P>
<P>
 The fickle nature of the power play ended up leading the Kings, who were four 
for eight with an advantage. But it also caused them and the sellout Forum 
crowd of 16,005 a few anxious moments. 
</P>
<P>
 It had appeared as though Robitaille's second goal and fourth point of the 
night decided the issue with 2:48 remaining in the game when he scored on the 
power play after Alexei Zhitnik's slap shot was tipped and trickled under 
Whaler goalie Sean Burke. Robitaille, from the edge of the right crease, had an 
easy tap-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then referee Denis Morel shocked almost everyone by calling a penalty on King 
defenseman Rob Blake with 1:32 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings not only had to kill off the penalty, but it turned into a 
six-on-four advantage when Burke was pulled for an extra attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was going to call it," King Coach Barry Melrose said. "Deja vu. I 
don't know, I'm clairvoyant. I've been watching the Dionne Warwick station." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky ended the suspense by getting his second goal of the night and fourth 
point, finishing off a give-and-go with Jari Kurri with an empty-netter with 36 
seconds remaining. The Kings (17-21-4) are 6-2-1 in their last nine games and 
are one point out of a playoff spot.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was like pulling teeth tonight," Melrose said. "The game last night took a 
lot out of us. It was very hard. We weren't at our best tonight, but we still 
found a way to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Whaler Coach Pierre McGuire: "Their power play is obviously very 
talented. You are talking about a lot of rifles there, and they're all full of 
bullets." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it turned into a close game when the Whalers scored twice to tie the 
score, 4-4, starting with Geoff Sanderson's power-play goal at 18:41 of the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the third, the Kings could only dodge the danger of the breakaway so 
long. Goaltender Kelly Hrudey stopped the Whalers' first three breakaways, but 
forward Michael Nylander converted on the fourth at 5:10 of the third. 
Nylander, having been shut out twice on breakaways, figured Hrudey out on his 
third of the night to tie the score at 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Until late in the second, it had seemed as though the Kings' potent power play 
would be enough to give them some room against Hartford since the Kings have 
the NHL's best power play at home with a success rate of 29.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the power-play goals came in the second period from Robitaille at 9:20 
and Tomas Sandstrom at 13:28. Those goals gave the Kings a 4-2 lead. It was 
Robitaille's 23rd of the season and 14th on the power play. Sandstrom, who has 
15 goals, has scored five goals in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two King goals came from Kurri at 2:32 of the second period and 
Gretzky on the power play at 10:34 of the first. Gretzky scored when his shot 
from the lower right circle went off defenseman Bryan Marchment's skate and 
squirted between Burke's pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's two goals were his 18th and 19th of the season, and he now needs 18 
goals to pass Gordie Howe's all-time record of 801 NHL goals. He had been 
thinking about his 2,400th point, saying: "It's kind of funny. For someone to 
break that, they'd have to play 24 years and score 100 points a year. So I 
guess that's pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Melrose was pleased with forward Dixon Ward's debut on Tuesday 
night against San Jose. Ward, acquired on Saturday from Vancouver for center 
Jimmy Carson, had three good scoring opportunities, fought Bob Errey and drew a 
penalty to give the Kings a power play late in the game. "I liked him," Melrose 
said. "He checks. He can take draws. He did everything. He's like a bigger 
(Tony) Granato. He makes people mad at him." . . . Left wing Warren Rychel 
(left ankle bruise) was scratched against the Whalers. Right wing Dave Taylor 
(concussion) was scratched for the third consecutive game. Defenseman Rob Blake 
(sprained knee) was going to sit out, but he took the pregame warm-up and felt 
good enough to play. Forward Phil Crowe was a healthy scratch.

NHL ROUNDUP; RED WINGS BECOME THE LATEST VICTIMS OF LIGHTNING, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All of a sudden, no one wants any part of the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lightning, which has frustrated the NHL's best teams, defeated the Detroit 
Red Wings, 4-2, Wednesday night at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay is 6-1-1 in its last eight games, with victories over the New York 
Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs and Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing very disciplined hockey right now," Lightning Coach Terry Crisp 
said. "We played well enough in the neutral zone that they weren't able to get 
up a head of steam. The few times they did, (goaltender Daren) Puppa was 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was only the second in 15 games for the Red Wings, who had a 
nine-game home unbeaten streak ended. They took a season-low 17 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tampa Bay just completely shut us down," Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman said. 
"That's the fewest chances we've had all year. I think we got 9-10, and most of 
those were on the power play." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Detroit's first home loss in more than two months, dating to a Nov. 9 
loss to the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played very defensively, like Anaheim does," Nicklas Lidstrom said. 
"Tampa Bay did a better job of executing, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, New Jersey 2 -- Vincent Damphousse had a goal and an assist and 
the Canadiens' penalty killers repeatedly stifled the Devils at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Damphousse and Benoit Brunet scored in the first period, when the Canadiens 
had to kill off five minor penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Muller had a power-play goal in the second period for Montreal, which has 
won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 4, Quebec 3 -- Trevor Linden scored a short-handed goal with 52 
seconds to play to lift the Canucks at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg 3, Buffalo 2 -- Teemu Selanne tied the score and set up Nelson 
Emerson's game-winning goal in the third period at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Selanne took a pass from Teppo Numminen to score from the faceoff circle and 
pull the Jets even at 14:15 of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than two minutes later, Selanne came in on a rush with Emerson 
and set up the winning goal.

DUCKS ARE NOT SO MIGHTY AGAINST SHARKS; HOCKEY: THEY ARE 0-5 AGAINST SAN JOSE 
AFTER LATEST LOSS, 5-2. TROUBLES AT HOME CONTINUE.

 Say this for the Mighty Ducks: They haven't been swept by the San Jose Sharks 
-- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are merely 0-5 against the Sharks. After a 5-2 loss Wednesday night, 
they have one more chance to avoid being blanked in the six-game season series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks have won only 13 times all season -- only eight times against teams 
other than the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks turned in one their uglier performances of the season, yet did it in 
front of another sellout crowd of 17,174 -- the fourth Anaheim Arena sellout in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 All those ticket-buyers must be feeling as if they're being duped by now. They 
get reports of an exciting, successful team in the road games, then pay their 
money to watch an anemic, mistake-prone one at Anaheim Arena, where the Ducks 
are 4-14-2. The home crowd hasn't seen the Ducks win in a month, since an 
overtime victory over St. Louis Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 How to turn it around? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe reverse sweater night? I don't know," Coach Ron Wilson said. "I really 
don't know what to say. The players are having a meeting right now. Ask the 
players, I'm going to ask the players myself tomorrow why we don't play with 
the same intensity at home. Maybe it's the weather, the palm trees. I want to 
hear what their excuses are because I'm sure they have a number of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Said right wing Terry Yake: "The bottom line is it's got to come from inside. 
I don't care what you wear, what you eat, where you sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Johan Garpenlov and Sergei Makarov each had two goals, and Igor Larionov and 
Makarov had four points each. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' success has been built on defense and goaltending, and both were 
off Wednesday. Wilson said the best defenseman was Don McSween, who arrived 
only Tuesday from minor league San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Ducks' most steadfast qualities this season has been the 
goaltending of Guy Hebert and Ron Tugnutt, but for the second consecutive game, 
the goaltending was shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert entered the game with a 2.74 goals-against average, but left in the 
second period after giving up a goal in the first and three in the first 6:28 
of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 6 1/2 minutes were his undoing. At 1:25 of the second, Makarov picked up 
the puck in the neutral zone than skated in and scored with a rising shot that 
skipped off Hebert's left shoulder and into the net for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks scored a power-play goal at 3:08 on defenseman Bill Houlder's shot 
from the left circle with Jaroslav Otevrel off for hooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Larionov scored the Sharks' second goal of the second period at 4:03, when he 
eluded defenseman David Williams' stick, then threw a shot at Hebert that 
actually landed in the crease and then bounced in. Larionov appeared to be 
laughing at his good fortune as he headed back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert's last act was to watch Johan Garpenlov score his second goal of the 
game after waltzing into the crease alone, gliding and cutting and finally 
putting the fourth puck of the night past Hebert. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson took the opportunity to send in Tugnutt, who wasn't very sharp himself 
in Monday's 6-4 loss to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 2 1/2 minutes later, Tugnutt fell victim too, when Makarov's shot 
from behind the goal line went in off the back of Tugnutt's stick. Larionov, 
too, seemed amused at his luck. The goal came with the Sharks holding a two-man 
advantage with Stu Grimson in the box for slashing and Alexei Kasatonov beside 
him for boarding. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Don McSween, the San Diego Gull defenseman who was given a tryout Tuesday, 
signed a one-year contract and played in Wednesday's game. With defensemen 
Randy Ladouceur (bruised right thigh) and Sean Hill (sprained left shoulder) 
out, McSween was needed to give the Ducks a sixth defenseman. Myles O'Connor 
has been on personal leave and was assigned to San Diego for conditioning. 
Another Gull defenseman who has played two games for the Ducks, Anatoli 
Fedotov, was unable to join Anaheim because of a recent injury.

NBA ROUNDUP; HAWKS' VICTORY OVER BULLS BUILDS LEAD TO THREE GAMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Chicago Bulls for the first time in seven 
meetings and extended their Central Division lead over the defending NBA 
champions to three games with a 92-81 victory Wednesday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins scored 19 points and had 10 rebounds as the Hawks, who were 
swept in a three-game series by the Bulls in last year's playoffs and routed by 
them, 106-80, earlier this season, extended their winning streak to six games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls led only once, on Horace Grant's game-opening field goal, and 
committed a season-high 27 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds for Chicago. Steve Kerr, Pete 
Myers and Scottie Pippen each scored 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 94, Boston 84 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 37 points to help the Rockets 
end a 12-year winless streak at Boston Garden as the Celtics tied a 45-year-old 
team record with their sixth consecutive home loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon, who matched his season high in scoring, also had 11 rebounds and six 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 118, Orlando 109 -- Gerald Wilkins made 15 of 22 shots, including 
six of eight three-pointers, and scored a season-high 38 points to lead the 
Cavaliers at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Daugherty had 25 points and nine rebounds for Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 103, Dallas 85 -- The Mavericks, who beat Minnesota twice for their 
only victories in 32 games this season, tied an NBA record at Dallas with their 
16th consecutive home loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks matched the record for home futility set by the Orlando Magic in 
the 1989-90 and 1990-91 seasons. Orlando lost 14 in a row at home to close out 
the 1989-90 season before losing two more in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 107, Denver 96 -- Reggie Miller made all 15 of his free throws and 
scored 29 points to lead the Pacers at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 100, Miami 92 -- Chris Webber, despite a sore back, scored 27 
points to lead the Warriors at Oakland.

CLIPPERS FIND NO QUARTER IN PHILADELPHIA; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY FALL TO 76ERS, 
117-98, AS LOSING STREAK HITS SEVEN. NEWLY ACQUIRED ELLIS HAS TEAM-HIGH 23 
POINTS.

<P>
 The way the Clippers have been playing lately, it probably won't be long 
before Coach Bob Weiss, who held a second training camp earlier this month, 
convenes yet another.  
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia 76ers extended the Clippers' losing streak to seven with a 
117-98 victory Wednesday night before 8,256 at the Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Off to their worst start since 1990-91, the Clippers (11-21) are in the midst 
of their longest losing streak in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who have lost 11 of their last 13 games, collapsed in the third 
quarter for the second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 After being outscored, 29-15, in the third quarter of Tuesday night's 98-77 
loss to the Knicks at New York, the Clippers were outscored, 35-15, in the 
third quarter by the 76ers, who shot 60% in the period on the way to a 
season-high 58.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The third quarter was a big problem," Weiss said. "As soon as a couple things 
went wrong, nobody could step up and make a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to do it by ourselves. We stopped moving. In the third quarter of 
the Knick game we got a lot of good shots and missed. I don't know if we got 
that many good ones (against the 76ers)." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie swingman Harold Ellis, who signed with the Clippers last Friday, was 
the only bright spot, scoring a team-high 23 points in 27 minutes as a reserve. 
Ellis made six of 11 shots and 11 of 14 free throws. He also had a team-high 
six rebounds and two steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to do something to help the team win," Ellis said. "I was 
just doing what I could, whether it was diving for a loose ball or getting a 
steal or getting a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited just to be here. It's like a dream come true. I want to get 
here and make a positive impact. I'll always be excited because this is the 
best basketball league in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The last player cut in training camp, Ellis went to the Continental Basketball 
Assn., where he averaged 21.4 points and six rebounds for the Quad City Thunder 
before the Clippers called. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis' performance Wednesday night impressed the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He works hard and gives a total effort on the basketball floor," Clipper 
guard Mark Jackson said. "If we had 12 guys like him we'd be in business. He 
flat out goes out and plays the game of basketball, and that's what we need." 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting 63.2% in the first half to take a 57-54 lead, the Clippers shot 
39.5% in the second half and were outscored, 63-41. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnovers continued to plague the Clippers. Averaging an NBA-high 19.1 going 
into the game, the Clippers had 21 to help set up 30 points for the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Ron Harper and Jackson, who combined for only 10 points and missed 11 
of 14 shots against the Knicks, were outscored, 44-26, by Philadelphia guards 
Jeff Hornacek and Dana Barros. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper had 18 points but missed 10 of 19 shots and Jackson had eight points, 
eight assists and five steals in 26 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornacek had a game-high 24 points, 15 in the second half, and Barros had 20 
points and a career-high 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Shawn Bradley, Philadelphia's 7-foot-6 center, made seven of eight 
shots and had 17 points, eight rebounds and three blocked shots as Philadelphia 
won its second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 The 76ers, who haven't made the playoffs since 1991, were talking playoffs 
after posting their second two-game winning streak of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they'll get another crack at the NBA lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia center Moses Malone remained sidelined because of a sore back. He 
has missed six of the last seven games. . . . Clipper guard Randy Woods, who 
grew up in Philadelphia and played at La Salle, gave out 52 tickets for the 
game. He scored three points in seven minutes. Woods' mother provided a fried 
chicken dinner for the team in the locker room after the game.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; GEORGIA TECH SURPRISES NORTH CAROLINA TO GIVE 
CREMINS NO. 350 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's something about the nation's No. 1 team that brings out the best in 
Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17th-ranked Yellow Jackets, riding a 27-point performance by Travis Best 
and clutch second-half shooting from Fred Vinson, crushed No. 1 North Carolina, 
89-69, on Wednesday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Georgia Tech's second victory in a row over the Tar Heels when they 
were ranked No. 1, the other coming in the finals of last year's Atlantic Coast 
Conference tournament, 77-75. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellow Jackets also beat Duke last season, 80-79, when the Blue Devils 
were ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave one of the finest performances I've seen since I've been coaching 
here," said Yellow Jacket Coach Bobby Cremins after collecting his 250th 
victory at Georgia Tech and 350th overall in 19 years as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Said North Carolina Coach Dean Smith: "Tech played a tremendous game. That's 
not just the coach talking. I think anyone who saw the game would say that. 
Maybe they're better than we are every night, but I hope not." 
</P>
<P>
 Best scored 10 of his 27 points in the final 2:45, eight of those on free 
throws as the Yellow Jackets, who never trailed, ended North Carolina's 10-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels, 12-2 overall and 2-1 in the ACC, lost in their first game since 
climbing to No. 1 in the Associated Press poll on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech (10-3, 1-2) also got 22 points from James Forrest, eight of those 
in the last 3:10, when the Yellow Jackets took control after Eric Montross' 
jump hook closed the deficit to 68-64 with 3:55 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Montross led North Carolina with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Kentucky 98, Mississippi 64 -- Sophomore forward Walt McCarty, making 
his first start of the season, made five of his first six shots and scored 24 
points to lead the Wildcats (12-2, 2-1) over the Rebels (5-6, 0-3) in a 
Southeastern Conference game at Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarty, who replaced Rod Rhodes in the lineup, helped Kentucky hand 
Mississippi its fifth consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes, who lost his starting role because of poor rebounding in recent games, 
came off the bench to grab a team-high eight rebounds and score 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky led at halftime, 60-27, after scoring 26 points off 21 turnovers and 
making 21 of 36 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Purdue 89, Michigan State 77 -- Glenn Robinson scored 25 points to help 
the Boilermakers (14-0, 2-0) to a Big Ten Conference victory over the Spartans 
(10-5, 1-2) at West Lafayette,Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 Minnesota 90, No. 12 Wisconsin 53 -- Voshon Lenard scored 23 points and 
Arriel McDonald had a school-record 16 assists to help the Gophers (11-3, 2-0) 
defeat the Badgers (11-1, 2-1) in a Big Ten game at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Finley scored 15 points for Wisconsin, which failed its first big test 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Highly touted freshman Rashard Griffith managed only three points for the 
Badgers, who made only 41% of their shots and had a season-high 24 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter who we would have played tonight, we would have won," Minnesota 
Coach Clem Haskins said. "It just happened to be the Badgers." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most lopsided game ever between the teams, which have played 159 
times since 1900. 
</P>
<P>
 Seton Hall 61, No. 20 Boston College 53 -- Bryan Caver and Arturas Karnishovas 
scored the last 18 points for the Pirates (8-4, 1-3) in their Big East 
Conference victory over the Eagles (10-4, 2-2) at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 22 Alabama Birmingham 88, Cal State Sacramento 46 -- Robert Shannon scored 
19 points as the Blazers (12-1) romped over the Hornets (1-13) at Birmingham, 
Ala., for their 10th consecutive victory. Cal State Sacramento has lost 40 
consecutive road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama 73, No. 24 Vanderbilt 67 -- Jamal Faulkner, a transfer from Arizona 
State, scored 21 points to help the Crimson Tide (5-5, 2-1) defeat the 
Commodores (8-4, 1-2) in a Southeastern Conference game at Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 25 Xavier of Ohio 57, Dayton 46 -- Brian Grant scored 11 points in the 
second half to help the Muskateers (10-1) defeat the Flyers (4-8) at 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame 77, No. 25 Missouri 73 -- Ryan Hoover made five three-point baskets 
and scored 25 points as the Irish (5-7) surprised Missouri (10-2) at South 
Bend, Ind., ending the Tigers' nine-game winning streak.

SANTA MARGARITA ROUTS NEWPORT HARBOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita boys' basketball team beat Newport Harbor handily, 80-43, 
Wednesday, again showing the unpredictability of the Sea View League. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I can say, is that I don't know what to say," Santa Margarita 
Coach Jerry DeBusk said."Last night we had to practice off campus and we had 
one of our worst practices, but then we come out and play like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor (9-7, 2-2), coming off a big victory over Tustin Monday, was 
hampered by inconsistent shooting and 23 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Brian Finneran had 10 points and six rebounds in the first 
half, helping Santa Margarita (12-4, 4-0) to a 36-13 lead. Finneran finished 
with 19 points and 12 rebounds. Senior guard Brian Scoggin had 19 points and 
Brad Finneran added 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's leading scorer, Ramy Shoukry, was shut down for most of the 
game; he scored six of his 10 points in the fourth quarter. He also had eight 
rebounds. PETER BARZILAI

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; A FREEWAY LEAGUE VICTORY, REVENGE IS SWEET FOR TROY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mere two games into Freeway League play and Troy's basketball team already 
is celebrating victories with group hugs at midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach T.J. Hardeman was not about to spoil the Warriors' good time. Not 
after their 59-55 overtime victory over Sonora Wednesday night at Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
 It ended the Raiders' 13-game league winning streak and also made the Warriors 
the league's front-runner. It also avenged a 26-point loss to the Raiders in a 
tournament this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some rumblings that Sonora was going to go undefeated again," 
Hardeman said. "It's not going to happen now." 
</P>
<P>
 Troy (11-7, 2-0) made sure by outscoring the Raiders, 5-1, in overtime. Sonora 
didn't exactly help itself by going zero for five from the field in the extra 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Sand's free throw finally clinched the victory with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 By outlasting the Raiders, Troy was saved from a devastating loss. The 
Warriors (11-7, 2-0) controlled the game for nearly three quarters only to 
nearly hand it to Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders appeared tentative when Troy went to a zone defense in the first 
quarter. It neutralized Craig Clark, Sonora's 7-foot center, who had scored 
seven points in the first two minutes. He scored only seven more the rest of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy built a 12-point lead with outside shooting, including eight three-point 
field goals. Greg Abbott's three-point play gave Troy a 47-35 lead with 2 
minutes 40 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Warriors hit a cold spell, making only three of 17 field-goal attempts 
during the final 10 minutes 40 seconds of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora (14-4, 1-1) nearly won the game at the end of regulation, but Chad

<P>
 Antoine Jefferson and Tes Whitlock dominated down the stretch, helping 
Saddleback to a 91-79 victory over Rancho Santiago in an Orange Empire 
Conference men's basketball game Wednesday in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Each finished with 23 points for Saddleback (12-6, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Amos had 31 points, including 22 in the second half, for Rancho Santiago 
(14-6, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson had 11 points and Whitlock eight in the final 8 minutes 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the 12-point margin, Rancho Santiago was within four with 1:15 to play 
when Matt Kordik (22 points) made a three-pointer to cut the lead to 80-76. 
</P>
<P>
 After a timeout, Saddleback beat the press and Whitlock got a dunk and the 
Gauchos led, 82-76. After a missed shot by the Dons, Whitlock drove to the 
basket and was fouled. He made both free throws and Saddleback was up, 84-76, 
with 55 seconds left. He had also made two free throws with 1:32 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a little pressure," Whitlock said about the late free throws. "But I 
knew the team needed them. I just went up and knocked them down." 
</P>
<P>
 He made seven of eight free-throw attempts in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos had a three-pointer to get the Dons within seven, 86-79, with 35 seconds 
left. But Jefferson added two free throws with 18 seconds left and a rebound 
basket as time ran out. Jefferson was 10 of 12 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one we really wanted to play well in," Saddleback Coach Bill Brummel 
said. "We think (Rancho Santiago) is a really good team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos had a 48-38 halftime lead thanks in part to the strong play of 
guards Josh Borella and Derrick Walsh. Each had 12 points in the half. Borella 
ended with 18 points and Walsh 16. 
</P>
<P>
 In other men's games: 
</P>

3-0). Jennifer Johnson scored a season-high 20 points for No. 7 Cypress (17-5,

CAL LUTHERAN GOES WITH FLOW AND DOWNS OCCIDENTAL, 108-89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As votes of confidence go, it was as subtle as they come. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cal Lutheran Coach Mike Dunlap's decision not to call a timeout with 12 
1/2 minutes left in Wednesday night's Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference opener between the Kingsmen and Occidental will not be 
forgotten by his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran had a 16-point lead with 14 minutes 41 seconds left in the game, 
but Occidental went on a 10-0 run over the next minute and a half to make a 
game of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many coaches would have called a timeout at that juncture, but Dunlap told his 
charges to play on and they proceeded to score on seven of their next nine 
possessions on their way to a 108-89 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I probably would have called a timeout," Dunlap said. "But this is 
a veteran group and I have confidence in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus I didn't want to call time out and give Occidental a chance to catch 
their breath completely. They're a very streaky team and I figured it was best 
to let them play out the streak they were on." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran forward Rupert Sapwell, who scored 17 points and grabbed 15 
rebounds, glanced toward the Kingsmen bench in the midst of Occidental's run, 
but was glad to see no signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt proud that he would let us keep playing," Sapwell said. "It 
showed that he was confident we could maintain our composure." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran did exactly that by going on a 16-6 run to take an 81-65 lead 
with 7:19 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Kingsmen scored during the run, which began on a pair of free throws by 
Derrick Clark, who scored 16 points, and ended on a three-point bomb by Damon 
Ridley, who had 22 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got back into our game," Sapwell said. "Occidental had gotten us into 
their chatter game and for a little bit there, I think we were more concerned 
with what we were going to say to them than with what we were doing on the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the 12th without a loss for Cal Lutheran this season, but the 
two-time defending SCIAC champions got some bad news earlier in the day when 
guard Jason Smith was diagnosed with a bone chip on his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 6-foot-5 freshman from Melbourne, Australia, who is averaging 11.1 
points and 5.4 rebounds a game, is expected to be out for a minimum of three 
weeks and could be lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to conference play," Dunlap said dejectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Tapp, who had 11 points, replaced Smith in the starting lineup and junior 
forward Paul LaMott contributed 26 minutes off the bench with 15 points, making 
six of nine shots, and added four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rupert, Paul and Dave (Ulloa) all did a great job of stepping up their games 
tonight without Jason," Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulloa had 20 points, six assists and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair Slattery had 21 points and 15 rebounds for Occidental (6-5), but last 
season's SCIAC player of the year did not score until the Tigers trailed, 23-8. 
Cal Lutheran led, 51-34, at halftime.

GRANT FINDS RANGE IN 2ND HALF TO OVERCOME IMPROVING SYLMAR; HIGH SCHOOL 
BASKETBALL: LANCERS ERASE SIX-POINT HALFTIME DEFICIT FOR 59-48 VICTORY AND STAY 
UNBEATEN IN VALLEY PAC-8.

<P>
 Grant High overcame a dismal first-half shooting performance to score a 59-48 
come-from-behind victory over upstart Sylmar Wednesday in a Valley Pac-8 
Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 The host Lancers, who improved to 11-3 overall and 3-0 in league play, trailed 
from the opening basket until midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (8-7, 3-1), much improved from years past, dominated inside, 
outrebounding the Lancers, 37-25, but the Spartans lost their grip on the lead 
in the third quarter and could not recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sylmar is) a legitimate basketball team," Grant Coach Howie Levine said. 
"They shoot very well, move the ball well. . . . They set a lot of decent picks 
in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar led at the half, 20-14, and once was up by nine. But the Lancers, who 
shot 8% in the first quarter and only 25% at the break, found their groove 
after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Patterson's three-point basket made the score 29-27 with 3:21 left in the 
third period, giving Grant a lead it didn't relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson and Ali Karimian combined for 20 of Grant's 25 points in the third 
quarter as the Lancers took a 39-30 lead into the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinpoint shooting was the difference. Grant converted 10 of 16 shots (63%) in 
the third period and outscored Sylmar, 25-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin Castro (10 rebounds) stepped up for Grant in the fourth quarter, scoring 
12 of his game-high 17 points to keep Sylmar at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar pulled to within six on Hector Ibarra's layup with 2:30 remaining, and 
to within 51-47 on Joe Guerra's three-point basket with less than a minute 
left, but Grant outscored the Spartans 8-2 until the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra finished with with 15 points -- all on three-point shots -- but Grant 
held Sylmar's leading scorers, Michael Farmer (nine points) and Lamarr Thompson 
(seven) in check. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson however, had a game-high 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sylmar Coach Jose Fernandez was pleased with the Spartans' inside 
play, he said he was upset that the officials continue to think of Sylmar as a 
loser. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referees took a lot of momentum away in the second half," Fernandez said. 
"Until you beat a team like Grant, you're not going to get the calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar had not won more than four games in each of the last four years. 
Fernandez, now in his second season, is determined to change that legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you are Sylmar High School, the calls are gonna go against you," 
Fernandez said. "These guys aren't losers -- you saw that -- but the referees 
consider us losers."

SIX YELLOW CARDS ASSURE REMATCH CLEAN AS WHISTLE; SOCCER: HARVARD-WESTLAKE'S 
2-0 VICTORY IN FIRST GAME WITH NOTRE DAME SINCE ANGELINI INCIDENT IS 
UNEVENTFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At long last, a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake High defeated Notre Dame, 2-0, Wednesday at Harvard-Westlake 
in a Mission League soccer match that was thankfully uneventful. 
</P>
<P>
 In the previous meeting between the teams last February, Notre Dame's Ryan 
Herrera was kicked in the head by the Wolverines' Dwight Angelini, ending both 
players' seasons and touching off a painful legal and emotional ordeal for 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelini graduated last year but his brother, Brian, and Herrera both played 
-- Herrera at sweeper and Angelini at midfield. As players and coaches 
confidently predicted before the match, the two players -- and the two teams -- 
played a routine match in which the referee doled out six yellow cards, but 
compared to last season's meeting was sparkling clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad it turned to be a very clean match," said Angelini, who scored 
the first goal for the Wolverines. "There were no problems or anything. That's 
what I expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, who suffered headaches and neck pain for many months after the kick, 
was unhappy about the defeat but acknowledged he felt a tinge of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least coming here is gone," he said. "It was the scariest part of the 
season. But I feel great." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Notre Dame Coach Colm McFeeley: "We're all real pleased. It's good for 
the game that there were no injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 The first half was a scoreless struggle. In the second half, Harvard-Westlake 
(10-0-3, 5-0 in league play) created some good scoring opportunities and 
converted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth minute of the second half, Angelini received a crossing pass on 
a free kick from junior midfielder Jeremy Kroger, touched it past Notre Dame 
goalkeeper Charlie Butterworth and scored to make it 1-0. Wolverine junior 
Warren Davidoff added an insurance goal in the 28th minute.

ROUNDUP; FOURTH-QUARTER RALLY BRINGS BELL-JEFF A POINT SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff is still looking for its first Camino Real League basketball victory 
basketball after a near-miss Wednesday in a 60-59 loss to visiting La Salle. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff forward Danny Mancinelli had 28 points and rallied the Guards from a 
seven-point deficit with 15 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancinelli stole an inbounds pass and dunked at the other end with less than a 
minute left to make it 60-59. But the Guards (5-10, 0-2 in league play) who got 
the ball back with 20 seconds left, turned the ball over then committed a 
flagrant foul. 
</P>
<P>
 La Salle missed both free throws but retained possession because of the 
flagrant foul and ran out the clock.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; MAYORAL RACE DRAWS 20 POSSIBLE CHALLENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Mayor Ernie Kell thought he had his hands full the last time he ran for 
office in 1990, this time he had better wear a catcher's mitt. In 1990, eight 
people ran against Kell and the mayor came so close to losing to Councilman 
Thomas Clark that Kell gave a concession speech before learning that the last 
ballots had given him the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 This time nearly 20 people have announced that they intend to run for Kell's 
job, and a dozen have taken out papers. The deadline for returning the papers 
is Friday. The election is scheduled for April 12, and a runoff election will 
be held in June if no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the familiar faces are Vice Mayor Jeffrey A. Kellogg, Councilman Ray 
Grabinski, Beverly O'Neill, former Long Beach City College president, and Don 
Westerland, former redevelopment agency chairman. Both Dan Rosenberg, a 
frequent City Council critic, and Thomas (Ski) Demski, the bearded superpatriot 
who ran against Kell in 1990, are making another run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge field," said Bill Joder, deputy city clerk. "We have the young 
and the old, women and men, the habitual challengers and some serious 
contenders." 
</P>
<P>
 Kell says he has a strategy to handle them all. But it's a secret, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to Kell, Councilman Warren Harwood probably will face the most opposition 
in April's election. Eight people have taken out papers to run against him, 
including Jerry Shultz, a former Long Beach Unified School District board 
member, and community activist Rod Givens.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; KELLOGG'S CALL TO ARMS GETS GUARDED RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask just about any candidate in April's municipal elections what the No. 1 
issue is, and the likely response is crime. Nearly all have something to say on 
the subject and can offer a few solutions, but one that's raising eyebrows, not 
to mention a few hackles, is Vice Mayor Jeffrey A. Kellogg's proposal to fight 
crime in Long Beach by putting the National Guard on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg asked Gov. Pete Wilson to create a pilot program in which a special 
Guard unit would help police patrol the city every week from sunset Thursday 
through sunrise Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 During that period, Kellogg said in a letter to the governor, Long Beach is 
typically patrolled by 95 squad cars with two officers in each. But it could be 
patrolled by 190 cars if one officer and one National Guard member teamed up in 
each. Kellogg also suggested that the National Guard could take over most of 
the duties at weekend sobriety checkpoints, freeing up more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach has hit a crisis point, setting a new record of 137 murders in 
1993. . . . Through using the guard, we can maximize the number of police 
officers and patrol cars on the streets protecting our neighborhoods," Kellogg 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice mayor acknowledges that his proposal has a few glitches. The National 
Guard cannot arrest anyone, for example. But it could help strengthen the Long 
Beach Police Department, which has 1.7 officers per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ernie Kell said he is appalled by the idea. "No. 1, the National Guard 
is not trained in law enforcement, and second, it sends a bad message about the 
city of Long Beach," Kell said. "We are not the Miami of the West Coast."

CITY HALL JOURNAL: COMPTON; FEDERAL MONEY MAKES FRIENDS OF OLD RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How does one get two bitter political rivals to share a stage and shake hands? 
</P>
<P>
 Put a check for more than $500,000 between them. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what brought Mayor Omar Bradley and Rep. Walter R. Tucker III 
(D-Compton) together in the City Council chambers recently. Tucker, the former 
mayor, brought a check for $563,526 from Washington. The check represented a 
portion of money due to Compton in asset forfeiture funds from a 1990 drug 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
 The Compton Police Department was the lead agency in breaking up the drug ring 
and officials seized about $4 million in cash and $8 million in property, 
police Chief Hourie Taylor said. He said about half of the seized assets should 
have been sent to Compton but that for more than three years the funds have 
been locked up in federal bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 About two months ago, Taylor solicited the help of Tucker. On Christmas Eve, 
Taylor was told that part of the money had been released. To show its 
appreciation, the City Council had a plaque made to thank Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between Tucker and Bradley have been chilly ever since Bradley 
accused Tucker of exploiting the 1992 Los Angeles riots to further his 
political career, and then publicly withdrew his endorsement of Tucker for the 
congressional race. But it was Bradley who presented the plaque for 
"outstanding community service" and shook Tucker's hand.

SURVIVOR HELPS OTHERS COPE WITH POST-POLIO SYNDROME; HEALTH: DOWNEY THERAPIST 
COUNSELS VICTIMS WHO RECOVERED FROM CHILDHOOD DISEASE, ONLY TO BE HIT BY 
PROBLEMS LATER. SHE ENCOURAGES THEM TO TAKE IT EASY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Work hard. Get normal. That was the rehabilitation philosophy in the 1940s and 
'50s for polio victims, and Grace Young took it to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were imbued with that philosophy," said the Downey woman, whose left leg 
was paralyzed by the disease when she was 9 and living in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of intensive therapy, Young regained the use of her leg, then 
embarked on an active life -- she danced, played tennis, worked full time, 
raised two children and helped her husband with his sales business. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked hard, got normal . . . and now: 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't dance anymore," said the occupational therapist at Kaiser Permanente 
Medical Center in Bellflower. "Both legs are weak. I can't even lift a 
five-pound weight." 
</P>
<P>
 What she should have done during all those years, as it turned out, was to 
have taken it a lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 60, has post-polio syndrome. It came upon her in the early 1970s when 
her legs weakened. She responded by riding an adult tricycle every night. "All 
it did was make me weaker," she said. "I had no idea how stupid it was." 
</P>
<P>
 The change in her condition had taken her by surprise, as it does most polio 
survivors. They have always assumed that, after having been stable for so long, 
there would be no further problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we know that survivors  
</P>
<P>
 who have overworked their weakened neuromuscular system are at risk," Young 
said. "After 30 years, the nervous system can't stand the demands on it. Muscle 
fibers start to deteriorate. The more active (a person) has been, the more 
likely (he or she) will get it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to government health statistics, about 600,000 of  
</P>
<P>
 the 1.6 million polio survivors in the United States are experiencing late 
effects of the disease, which usually begin about three decades after the 
disease first invaded their spinal cords. Many of these people, like Young, 
have been forced to return to wheelchairs and wear braces. 
</P>
<P>
 Young conducts classes at the hospital for polio survivors who are having new 
problems. She tells them to modify their lifestyles. "You can slow down the 
process," she told a recent group. "You can arrest the symptoms by conserving 
(energy)." 
</P>
<P>
 The therapist has gained a national reputation in post-polio syndrome. In 
1992, she addressed a Canadian polio conference in Vancouver, B.C., and she has 
written a book titled "Conserve to Preserve -- A Polio Survivor's Guide to 
Energy Conservation," which will be published soon by the International Polio 
Network in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very knowledgeable," said Dr. Jacquelin Perry, who has been seeing 
polio patients at Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey for 38 years. She 
diagnosed Young's condition in the mid-1970s, but it was so new it had yet to 
acquire a name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone is going to get it," said Perry, who conducts post-polio 
clinics. "Just those who overdo, and sometimes (living a) normal lifestyle is 
overdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 A pleasant woman with an expressive face highlighted by eyebrows that peek 
above fancy-framed spectacles, Young became interested in post-polio syndrome 
in 1986 when she entered USC to earn a master's degree. The syndrome, which had 
been infrequently discussed in medical literature, was the topic of her thesis. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I went back (to school) to stretch my mind, then I realized this was 
an area I knew nothing about and should learn," she said. "It was pretty much 
unexplored. All I knew was that I had it. So it became like a crusade." 
</P>
<P>
 She learned from Perry and by attending medical conferences that conserving 
energy is the preferred treatment for the syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 In Young's classes, which she has been conducting for four years, polio 
survivors are often shocked and dismayed when they learn why they are becoming 
weaker. "One woman cried through the whole thing and didn't come back for 3 1/2 
years," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such reactions don't surprise Young because of the nature of polio patients. 
"A very high percentage are hard-driving, goal-oriented perfectionistic and 
ambitious people," she said. "Everybody has pushed them to work very hard, do 
what everybody else did." 
</P>
<P>
 As James Ingham, 46, of Buena Park, left a recent class, he said, "It's a 
little bit scary when you first find out about this. You get to the point where 
you think this is behind you and you have a normal life, and then you find you 
might be facing this in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 (Young estimates that 60% to 70% of polio survivors will get post-polio 
syndrome.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ingham got polio at age 2 and was in braces and an iron lung. But since 
elementary school, his life has been active and normal. He has always exercised 
and, recently, joined a fitness club. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is not sure if he has experienced post-polio syndrome symptoms. 
"I'm wondering," he said. "At my age there's a certain amount of slowing down 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 His speculation is typical. "They think they're just getting older," Young 
said. "As polio survivors, we were all taught to ignore pain and fatigue, so a 
lot of us don't notice when things are getting bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingham said he is convinced now that strenuous exercise is not the best thing 
to do, but he plans to keep swimming, which Young recommends. "It's the one 
exercise polio survivors can do -- unless they overdo it," she said. "You just 
have to pay attention to pain. If it causes pain, stop." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young tells patients to sit whenever possible -- "standing takes 25% more 
energy" -- and to eliminate stairsteps from their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sit for almost everything, I sit when I cook," said the therapist, who 
wears a leg brace. She walks as little as possible, for the most part getting 
around in an electric cart. 
</P>
<P>
 She lives in a home full of ramps and adaptive equipment with her mother, two 
daughters, who do her marketing, and a son-in-law. Her husband died two years 
ago. She also has a housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been extremely lucky that I've been able to continue working full time," 
said Young, who conserves energy on the job by using her cart and taking 
noon-hour naps. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hospital's occupational therapy room, she works amid an array of 
exercise apparatus. She helps patients -- who include stroke and accident 
victims -- strengthen their muscles. "I don't have to do everything they do, I 
just show them how to do the exercises," she said. "But the job is a little 
stressing because I have to be up and down getting equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When polio patients enter the room, they never are handed dumbbells. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Young evaluates their lifestyles, determines their level of weakness 
and, if she thinks they need braces, refers them to doctors. And she puts them 
in her energy conservation classes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of those who have attended the classes have reported less pain 
and fatigue, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can relate to me," she said. "They listen to me because I've been 
through it. I'm no able-bodied young chick."

NEW FREEWAY MAY BE TRAFFIC HEADACHE OF THE CENTURY FOR CITY STREETS; 
TRANSPORTATION: HIGH-TECH 105 CORRIDOR IN SOME WAYS HAS CREATED MORE PROBLEMS 
THAN IT SOLVED, ESPECIALLY ON NORTH-SOUTH ROUTES. SOLUTIONS ARE BEING EXPLORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Century Freeway (105) opened in the fall, Caltrans officials 
predicted the 12-lane, super high-tech highway would reduce traffic in the 
surrounding cities by as much as 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for predictions.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three months later, many once-quiet surface streets are jammed with 
traffic in the Southeast cities along the 17.3-mile freeway, which runs between 
El Segundo and Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 In Downey, scores of cars flood Bellflower Boulevard at rush hour, forcing 
drivers to wait through up to four cycles of an oh-so-slow traffic light before 
hitting green. Officials say rush-hour traffic along Bellflower was light 
before the freeway opened. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lynwood, the city's only freeway exit -- Long Beach Boulevard -- is 
becoming increasingly congested, and commuters are clogging tiny residential 
streets to the south in an effort to escape the crush. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Norwalk, where the highway ends at the San Gabriel River Freeway (605), 
hundreds of motorists opt for nearby surface streets each evening to avoid the 
huge backups caused by the timed off-ramp signal that lets just three cars 
through at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway is equipped with the most modern technology -- including sensors 
buried in the pavement to monitor traffic flow, and closed-circuit television 
cameras to alert officials to accidents. But the roadway has caused some 
old-fashioned headaches for officials, residents and commuters in surrounding 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in these poor cities are finally looking around and asking, 'What has 
hit us?' " said Nancy Luque, who can see, hear and feel the new freeway from 
her home in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Luque and her neighbors now carefully plan when to pick up their children from 
piano lessons or sports activities, and they think twice about running to the 
store before dinner for fear of getting caught in a sea of cars.  
</P>
<P>
 They also dread the day in May, 1995, that the Green Line trolley starts 
running up the middle of the highway and several park-and-ride lots open 
adjacent to the freeway, increasing surface street congestion even more.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our community will never be the same," said Luque, who in 1984 organized 
Citizens Against Freeway Fallout to battle Caltrans' original plan to end the 
freeway at Studebaker Road, just beyond the 605 Freeway in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Caltrans said they are not surprised by the higher traffic 
volumes on the major north-south cross-streets, such as Bellflower, Lakewood 
and Paramount boulevards. They said they expect traffic to decrease eventually, 
as drivers adjust to new traffic patterns.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you open a major freeway like this, there are always going to be changes 
in traffic patterns that are basically very hard to predict," said Larry 
Loudon, who heads the traffic engineering division at Caltrans. "People are 
always uncomfortable with change at first, but they will get used to the new 
flow."  
</P>
<P>
 Loudon pointed out that Caltrans officials correctly predicted lighter traffic 
on major east-west streets, such as Imperial Highway and Rosecrans Avenue. 
Commuters who once used those streets are now using the new freeway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Century Freeway -- so-called because it was once supposed to run along 
Century Boulevard -- can carry up to 175,000 cars per day. The San Diego and 
Santa Monica freeways -- the county's busiest -- each carry more than 325,000 
cars daily, Loudon said. The freeway's name was changed to the Glenn M. 
Anderson Freeway in 1987 in honor of the retired congressman who helped obtain 
federal funding for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The roadway connects with four major north-south freeways: the San Diego 
(405), Harbor (110), Long Beach (710) and San Gabriel River (605). It runs 
parallel to the Pomona (60) and the Artesia (91) freeways, providing commuters 
with another east-west route.  
</P>
<P>
 Loudon said Caltrans will begin a second series of traffic volume studies on 
the freeway this month. Initial tests were completed before the $2.2-billion 
highway opened in October.  
</P>
<P>
 The newest study will evaluate access to and from the freeway and determine 
the need of longer signal cycles or additional traffic lights.  
</P>
<P>
 Some cities, however, are not waiting for the study. Last month, the Lynwood 
City Council, concerned about increased traffic in the residential 
neighborhoods, decided to spend $30,000 for its own traffic engineering study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caltrans tells us that we should wait six to nine months before re-timing the 
signals or re-striping lanes because people are still searching for new routes 
and the traffic patterns have not been established," City Manager Faustin 
Gonzales said. "But this is an aggravation to the residents now, and so we want 
to solve the problems now." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials in Downey said that since the freeway opened, they have 
received a steady stream of complaints from residents about increased delays 
along Lakewood Boulevard. The city will begin a traffic study similar to 
Lynwood's next month.  
</P>
<P>
 "The new freeway has been a mixed blessing," said Eric Zandvliet, the city's 
assistant traffic engineer. "Imperial Highway is a breeze; Lakewood (Boulevard) 
is the pits." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Norwalk -- where the freeway off- and on-ramps are not yet 
finished -- said they will wait until later this year to begin studies.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH GATE; FAMILY HEALTH CLINIC PROPOSED FOR CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials are considering a proposal to 
create a private health clinic on the South Gate Middle School campus to serve 
students and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, a collaborative effort of St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood 
and Cal State Dominguez Hills, is similar to a project under way in Lynwood and 
is part of the hospital's Targeting Healthy Communities project, said Gerald 
Kozai, vice president of professional services at St. Francis who oversees the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 A school-based clinic would give South Gate residents access to affordable, 
preventive health care, Kozai said. Representatives from St. Francis and the 
university are conducting a survey of more than 600 families in South Gate to 
determine the health needs of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus clinic would be staffed by a full-time nurse practitioner and other 
part-time personnel to handle obstetric, pediatric and other medical care. In 
addition to basic family health services, the clinic would offer some 
counseling and social services and provide training and placement for careers 
in health care, Kozai said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic proposal must be considered by district staff members and is 
expected to go before the Los Angeles Unified Board of Education in about two 
months, said Michael Godfrey, coordinator of the district's school-based health 
clinic program. If approved, a clinic could be operational next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The board first approved campus clinics in 1985. However, the clinics on the 
campuses of Jordan, Los Angeles and San Fernando high schools provide health 
care to enrolled students only.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LYNWOOD; FEB. 15 RUNOFF VOTE TO SETTLE SCHOOL BOARD TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lynwood Unified School District will have a special election Feb. 15 to 
break a tie between two incumbents seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Joe T. Battle and Rachel Chavez each received 1,281 votes in the 
Nov. 2 race. Two of the five board seats were on the ballot, but newcomer Laura 
M. Byrd outpolled the two incumbents. Chavez and Battle have continued to 
serve, making it a six-member board since December. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members decided Dec. 9 to hold the special election, which will 
cost an estimated $42,000. The county registrar's office last week set the Feb. 
15 date.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PARAMOUNT; FORMER SUPERINTENDENT LOSES SUIT OVER FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury has found that the Paramount school board did not 
discriminate against former Supt. Richard B. Caldwell when it decided not to 
renew his contract in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, deliberating in Los Angeles, also decided that Caldwell, who had 
been superintendent for almost 13 years, had breached his contract with the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell, now 68, had alleged in his lawsuit that he lost his job because of 
his age and race. He is white. The board hired Michele Lawrence, former deputy 
superintendent in the ABC Unified School District, as superintendent. She is a 
Latina and in her 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 In last November's election, Caldwell won a seat on the board that he was 
suing. At the meeting Tuesday night, Caldwell declined to comment on the 
outcome of his case. "As far as I'm concerned, it's over with," he said. "You 
win some, you lose some." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad Kohrs, attorney for the Paramount Unified School District, said that in 
addition to rejecting Caldwell's discrimination claim, "the jurors felt the 
evidence showed that Caldwell had been lackadaisical in his performance of his 
duties. . . ." Kohrs said he will ask the court to order Caldwell to reimburse 
the district for legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell's attorney, Dale Gronemeier), said jurors were apparently unmoved by 
comments that board members had made about the superintendent's age and race.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LYNWOOD; INJURED MOBIL STRIKER SETTLES SUIT FOR $350,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Gardena-based security company has agreed to pay $350,000 to a Mobil Oil 
worker who was critically injured in March, 1988, when a guard drove a pickup 
truck into a line of striking employees at the Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Excel Security Services and Juan Canizales, a Lynwood resident, reached an 
out-of-court settlement Friday just before trial was to begin in Torrance 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Canizales, who lives with his wife and three children, suffered head injuries 
when he was thrown onto the truck near the entrance to the Mobil refinery. He 
was in a coma for three days and hospitalized for nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guard Onna Brown, who was 20 at the time, was convicted of assault 
with a deadly weapon -- his truck -- and sentenced to nine months in Los 
Angeles County Jail. He served 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Excel was hired by Mobil to provide extra security during a strike by Local 
1-547 of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union. Brown reportedly was not 
working when he drove to the refinery and spoke briefly with another guard. He 
then sped into the picket line, grazing one striker and hitting Canizales. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Brown had been taunted by some of the workers, but Canizales 
did not participate. Canizales has kept his job as an equipment operator in the 
plant's fire and safety departments, a Mobil spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Excel could not be reached for comment.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; 23 YOUTHS DETAINED FOR VIOLATING CURFEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police detained 23 teen-agers over the weekend for violating an experimental 
curfew designed to take youths off the streets between 10 p.m. and sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew -- Wednesday through Sunday for anyone younger than 18 -- took 
effect Jan. 1, but was not enforced until last weekend.The 23 teen-agers were 
picked up Friday and Saturday nights, while Sunday passed without any curfew 
violations, said Officer Margarita DeWitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Curfew violators were taken to one of three city parks, where they were 
supervised by a police officer and recreation employees until a parent or 
guardian arrived. Those who were intoxicated, however, were held at the police 
station until a parent was contacted, DeWitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew was approved by the City Council on a six-month trial basis, in 
hopes that crime associated with teen-agers -- graffiti, assaults and 
gang-related violence -- would decrease. The municipal code governing the 
curfew does not specify a fine. City officials said first-time violators might 
not receive a citation, but repeat offenders may be cited for loitering.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA FE SPRINGS; $65,000 ALLOCATED FOR SOUTH WHITTIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Fe Springs will contribute $65,000 over the next few months to a 
community development project to help neighboring South Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will help pay the salaries of staff members whose job is to see that 
unincorporated South Whittier receives services such as law enforcement, 
graffiti removal and youth sports programs.They also oversee a county-funded 
home improvement program and affordable housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Santa Fe Springs, contributors include county officials and the 
South Whittier Community Coordinating Council, a volunteer group that functions 
as an unofficial city council for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Santa Fe Springs has contributed $1 million to the program, which 
is called the City/County Project. The city provides a three-person staff that 
acts as an unofficial city administration for South Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Springs council members recently considered ending their financial 
support. But City Manager Donald R. Powell said Santa Fe Springs has an 
interest in helping the county help South Whittier. "If South Whittier 
deteriorates, it would have a very negative influence on Santa Fe Springs." 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the funding by a 3-to-1 vote. Councilwoman Mercedes Diaz 
abstained because she owns property in South Whittier. Councilwoman Betty 
Wilson voted against the funding, saying the county should pay.

SHIPPING OUT; ONCE THE BIGGEST BUSINESS IN TOWN, THE DOWNSIZING OF THE NAVY 
HITS AT THE VERY HEART -- AND SOUL -- OF LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like so many others in those days, he first saw the city from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The jade-green roof of the old hotel Riviera steepled into a blue sky. The 
Pike amusement park spilled across the beach like a handful of children's toys 
on the city's front porch. In 1949, to an 18-year-old sailor from Winganon, 
Okla., it was beautiful. So Don Clark made Long Beach his home. He married, 
raised a family, made captain's rank and retired here. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time it was like this: When a sailor talked about the Navy on the 
West Coast, no one had to ask where on the coast. San Francisco and San Diego 
were Navy towns. Long Beach was the Navy town. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the city and the Navy got their first peek at each other at the 
turn of the century and grew up together. During the fever of World War II and 
Vietnam, Long Beach eclipsed all other West Coast Navy towns in size and 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach meant Navy on this coast," recalls Capt. Harry Selfridge, the 
current regional commander of naval activity in Central California. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of sailors -- men and women who spent years floating from one base 
to another -- decided to make their homes here. Meanwhile, the Long Beach Naval 
Shipyard next door to the Naval Station on Terminal Island offered thousands of 
locals steady work and good wages repairing ships. The shipyard gave many an 
opportunity to escape poverty, to buy homes with back yards and send their 
children to college. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy helped shape the city. It defined an era, and even after Vietnam, 
when the service's presence here began to dim, it remained part of the fabric 
of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Navy star in Long Beach is on the verge of being extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, just days after its 52nd birthday, the Long Beach Naval Station 
will close for the third, almost certainly last, time. Only four ships will 
remain at the naval station -- the last of a fleet of 38. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fleet will go at least 15,000 sailors once assigned to the station, 
and when they leave, an entire westside neighborhood where Navy families lived 
will vanish. Already, 400 homes in the Navy's Savannah housing tract just a few 
miles north of the station sit in eerie silence, isolated by chain-link fences 
topped with razor wire. Next door, the Cabrillo housing tract is slowly 
emptying as sailors are reassigned and their families are moved out. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the Long Beach Naval Hospital discharged its final patient, and 
in March will be closed. That same month, Long Beach will witness the 
commissioning of a new ship at the station. After the ceremony, the destroyer 
class USS Curtis Wilbur will also leave Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as city leaders plan, a mega-mall will take the place of the naval 
station. A university research park, two schools, a housing project for the 
homeless and a job-training center will erase any signs of the Savannah and 
Cabrillo housing tracts. The Port of Long Beach, growing by leaps and bounds, 
hopes to acquire whatever naval station property it can for a new shipping 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Long Beach Naval Shipyard will remain. After narrowly escaping 
closure two times in the last four years, its fate remains uncertain. In 
private, city, business and Navy officials predict that when Long Beach enters 
the next century, the Navy will not go with it. * 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel kind of lost," said Clark, one of an estimated 13,000 retired Navy 
people in the Long Beach and Los Angeles area. "As long as I've been here, 
there was a Navy and now it's going." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss will not jar the lives of all, perhaps not even most, Long Beach 
residents. But the ripples of closure are already reaching apartment owners and 
grocers, people who provided services to the families who lived in Navy 
housing, people whose jobs depended on the Navy and the estimated $330 million 
a year local Navy personnel spent. 
</P>
<P>
 For every military job that goes, 1.5 other jobs will disappear in the overall 
economy of the area, said Larry Kimble, director of the UCLA Business 
Forecasting Project, a privately funded program that conducts economic 
research. When the station closes nine months from now, a minimum of 15,000 
active-duty Navy personnel and their families will be gone. In that time, if 
the formula holds, more than 22,000 non-military jobs in Long Beach and 
surrounding cities will have vanished too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will have an impact on every grocery store, every hair stylist, every 
manicurist, doctor, lawyer," said Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach). "That's a 
(small) town disappearing off the face of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The cutting blow for the Navy in Long Beach fell in the fall of 1991. A 
federal base-closure commission appointed by then-President George Bush 
recommended closing both the station and the hospital, although neither the 
Navy nor the Department of Defense had pushed for such action. For a city in 
the midst of recession, the decision was a sucker punch that left local 
officials stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 Layoffs at McDonnell Douglas Corp. and the April, 1992, riots made a bad 
situation worse. The naval station closure alone is at least a 
$700-million-a-year blow to the local economy, city officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had to take the hit of losing the station all by itself and everything 
else was working fine, it wouldn't be such a big deal, but everything else 
isn't working fine," Long Beach City Manager James C. Hankla said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact is not only economic. For most people older than 50 who grew up in 
Long Beach, the Navy has been an enduring icon of the city's past, and of their 
youth. This generation has watched the once-festive Pike close in desolation, 
the half-moon of Rainbow Lagoon on the city's waterfront become a dirt lot, and 
the Long Beach Boulevard shopping district become a forlorn street of vacant 
lots and boarded-up automobile dealerships. To this older generation, the 
closure of the Long Beach Naval Station represents not only the dismantling of 
a defense industry, but another monument of their past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy is part of the old heritage here," said Vito Romans, a longtime Long 
Beach resident and member of its Armed Services Commission. "The new generation 
won't miss it, but we old-timers will. We know what it was like. We loved all 
the brass." 
</P>
<P>
 What it was like in its heyday was Alaskan king crab dinners, summer night 
dances and afternoon teas with officers and their wives. It was days at the 
beach or at the Pike, eating hotdogs dripping with mustard, and thousands of 
sailors flooding the downtown in waves of blue and white, crowding into bars 
with names like the Cruiser, the Midway and the Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailors helped police patrol the city after the 1933 earthquake. The Long 
Beach-based USS Arizona was destroyed in the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and while 
local families grieved, Long Beach spent nights in darkness for fear of 
Japanese attacks. There were also times when residents could not stand the 
sight of another uniform, the sound of another bar song. When the fleet came 
in, 30,000 stir-crazy sailors came with it and Long Beach residents had a 
choice: join the fun or get out of the way. Apartment owners posted signs 
reading "No dogs or sailors," parents kept their young daughters away from the 
Pike, and resentments simmered. By most accounts, those prickly days ended when 
World War II began. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during the war in the early 1940s that the naval station and naval 
shipyard were officially opened. After World War II, the Navy boomed, and 
newspaper stories proclaimed the Navy the biggest business in town. The station 
and shipyard closed briefly in 1950, and peaked again during the Vietnam era 
when 140 ships were home-ported at the station. In 1974 the station was caught 
in the inevitable post-war belt-tightening. Although not technically closed, it 
may as well have been. The Navy pulled out 63 ships and 20,000 sailors and sent 
most of them to San Diego. The station, redubbed a "support facility," was left 
with only four ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy's departure hit the city hard. As former Assistant City Manager John 
Shirey once said, "downtown died in 1974." 
</P>
<P>
 The decay left in the wake of the closure forced leaders to diversify the 
city's economic base. Redevelopment during the late 1970s and through the '80s 
gutted the downtown bars and pool halls and locker rooms that catered to 
sailors. The Pike that once lured Clark and thousands of other sailors closed. 
In their places have sprouted office buildings, high-rise condominiums and 
luxury hotels as Long Beach city officials seek to redefine the city as a 
center of international trade and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, the Navy base has been all but overwhelmedby the burgeoning ports of 
Long Beach and Los Angeles and has become lost in the gray industrial landscape 
just west of downtown.  
</P>
<P>
 Only a single tattoo parlor remains downtown and the artists there are more 
likely to work on trendy teen-agers. "Because the naval station was out of 
sight, people didn't realize its value over the years," said City Councilman 
Ray Grabinski, who has lived in Long Beach for 37 years. The future of the Navy 
in Long Beach now rests with the shipyard, and these days that's a little like 
building a house on sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shipyard employees and city officials say they can't imagine that the 
federal government would actually close the yard. In the last few years the 
shipyard has been singled out for doing work on schedule and under cost. It has 
received several commendations. It is capable of working on almost any ship. 
Besides, employees say, rumors that the shipyard would be closed have 
circulated for decades and it has not happened yet. Next year the last federal 
base closure commission will convene (with new appointees) and weigh the 
shipyard's future. J.B. Larkins, president of the Long Beach Naval Shipyard 
Employee Assn., is not optimistic. "This time they are going to use the big 
broom and sweep everything out, is what I'm thinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larkins came to the shipyard with a high school education in the days when it 
was so busy a person could work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and still 
not keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shipyard has been good to me," he said. "It provided me with a good 
living so I could raise my family. I was able to buy a home. It was the same 
for a lot of us. ." 
</P>
<P>
 With the station closing, the shipyard, today the city's fifth-largest 
employer, has lost its primary source of work. The shipyard must now look to 
foreign governments and the San Diego station for work. San Diego's private 
shipyards and congressional representatives are lobbying furiously for closure 
of the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. In the meantime, the Navy is reducing its 
fleet from 585 ships to 348. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, some Long Beach shipyard workers have less to do. Only three ships 
are currently under repair and there is not much promise that this year will be 
busy. In 1945, a peak of 16,091 people worked at the shipyard. In 1983, there 
were 6,978 employees. As of Dec. 10, there were 3,833 shipyard workers. City 
and local congressional leaders, recognizing that they have a tough fight on 
their hands, are already preparing for battle. There are those who say Long 
Beach has not been a Navy town for a long time, and there are others who say 
that no matter what happens, Long Beach will forever be one. "Look at history," 
said retired Rear Adm. John Higgenson, a Long Beach resident who was commander 
of naval activity in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties 
from 1986 to 1990. "There are eight, nine countries fighting around the world 
and we never know when one is going to get into our vital interests. . . . 
There is not one evil empire, but there are plenty of little empires." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the station never reopens, there will always be a relationship between 
the Navy and Long Beach, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be as obvious as it was in the past, but there will be people who 
will come and stand on the Promenade and remember their father or grandfather 
or aunt and uncle and how the Navy is the reason they came to Long Beach," 
Councilman Grabinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories may be all that remain. Three months ago, the naval station had its 
annual birthday ball in the banquet room of the Officers Club where the windows 
look out to the ships in the harbor and the sea beyond. This time, the event 
was called "The Last Hurrah." History of Navy in Long Beach

and the Navy's two housing tracts are nearly abandoned. If all goes as city 
leaders plan, a mega-mall will take the place of the naval station. A

 COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 If he had his druthers, Long Beach City College men's basketball Coach Gary 
Anderson said he would prefer to meet longtime rival Cerritos at the end of the 
South Coast Conference season. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the two state community college powers, who usually finish one-two in 
the conference standings, will meet in a conference opener at 7:30 p.m. 
Saturday at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos is 16-4 and ranked third in the state by the JC Athletic Bureau and 
Long Beach is 17-5 and ranked sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams have played twice this season in tournament finals. Cerritos won the 
first game, 98-86, in the Orange Coast tournament on Dec. 4 and Long Beach won 
the rematch, 95-83, in the Modesto tournament Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson is concerned because his team hasn't played a game, except for an 
exhibition against its alumni, in nearly three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to say how ready you are with that much time off," Anderson 
said. "You just hate to start the season with a game like this. This is the 
kind of game you'd rather play later on." 
</P>
<P>
 If the first two meetings are any indication, it should be a fast-paced, 
offense-driven game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos has been sparked by center Javan Rouzan, a 6-foot-7 sophomore from 
Lakewood High who averages 18.5 points and 10 rebounds and has made 56% of his 
shots from the field. Other leaders for the Falcons are 6-2 freshman guard 
Monty Owens, who averages 10.9 points, and 6-5 freshman forward Wayne Allen, 
who is averaging 10.8 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach has been led by sophomore 6-5 forward Kevin Beal, who was named the 
conference's most valuable player last season and averages 22 points. Beal has 
scored 58 points in the first two games between the teams and Rouzan has 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Other leaders for Long Beach include 6-0 sophomore guard Marcus Rogers with 18 
points and 6-5 freshman forward Mark Neal with 15 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're stronger inside than us and at times we're a little better on the 
perimeter," Anderson said. "Spot-for-spot I think they're a little stronger 
than us. We feel very fortunate to have beaten them the one time." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams will meet again Feb. 5 at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After defeating Harbor, 64-58, last week, the Cerritos College women's 
basketball team will play host to Mt. San Antonio in a South Coast Conference 
game at 7:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos, ranked 15th in the state, is 13-6 and 2-0. They have been led by 6-3 
sophomore center Kate Larrabee, who is averaging 21 points and 10 rebounds. 
PREPS 
</P>
<P>
 The Lynwood girls' basketball team is ranked No. 1 in Southern Section 
Division I in the season's first poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights, who finished 31-0 and won the state Division I title last season, 
are off to another fast start at 14-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood's San Gabriel Valley League rivals, Dominguez and Gahr, are listed in 
the Division II top 10. Dominguez, off to one of its best starts ever at 17-2, 
is ranked third and Gahr is seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Other teams listed in the girls poll are defending Division IV-A champion 
Valley Christian at No. 2 in Division IV and St. Anthony at No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez, which leads the list of ranked area boys teams, is No. 2 in 
Division II at 13-2 behind undefeated J.W. North (13-0). Among the wins for the 
Dons was a 65-48 upset three weeks ago against Oak Hill Academy of Virginia -- 
ranked No. 1 in the nation at the time by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John Bosco is ranked sixth in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division I, cross-town rivals Long Beach Poly and Long Beach Wilson are 
listed at No. 3 and 6, respectively, and Warren and Lynwood of the San Gabriel 
Valley League are at No. 5 and 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division IV, Whittier Christian is No. 5 and Del Rey League rivals Pius X 
and St. Anthony are No. 8 and 9.

</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State men's basketball team, which has won two Big West 
Conference games in a row after a loss to New Mexico State in its opener, will 
take to the road for its next two conference games. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers will play San Jose State at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at San Jose and 
Pacific at 7:30 Monday at Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach improved to 7-3 and 2-1 with a 78-66 conference win Monday over 
Nevada. It marked the first time the 49ers have won back-to-back games since 
going 3-0 to start the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers have been led on offense by 6-7 junior forward Mike Atkinson with a 
17.6-point average and freshman 6-6 forward James Cotton with 11.1 points. 
Atkinson was ranked No. 1 in the NCAA in field-goal percentage last week, 
having made 74.7% of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike understands his limitations and plays within himself," Coach Seth 
Greenberg said. "The key for him is taking the shots he can make. He 
consistently puts himself into position to take the high-percentage shot." 
BRIEFLY 
</P>
<P>
 Major league baseball players J.T. Snow of the Angels, Brett Boone of the

REVIEW; 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' DOESN'T SLIP ON THE ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Walt Disney's World on Ice Presents Beauty and the Beast" may not be the 
snappiest show title to come down the pike, but given the two-hour extravaganza 
that has been playing at Southland arenas, its clarity is undeniable.  
</P>
<P>
 Produced by Kenneth Feld, the honcho behind the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & 
Bailey Circus, this show is just what the title suggests: with few exceptions, 
it re-creates the 1991 Disney film to a T. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is the same, the characters are the same, the Academy Award-winning 
Howard Ashman-Alan Menken score is the same. Even most of the prerecorded 
voices are the same, up to and including Robby Benson as the gravel-voiced 
Beast. 
</P>
<P>
 So why schlep out to a chilly arena when you can enjoy the video in the 
comfort of your own La-Z-Boy? 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the ice show format adds a romantic sheen and an extra measure 
of drama that animation, no matter how slick, can't match. For example, when 
Belle, skated by Maradith Feinberg, sings wistfully of wanting "so much more 
than this provincial life," she glides and swirls dreamily across the full 
length of the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 When she and the love-struck Beast waltz, they seem to float above the surface 
of the ice -- no mean feat considering the bulky, seven-foot-tall costume that 
skater Craig Horowitz wears. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mickeyphiles, there's the de rigueur visit from the mouse and his gang, 
who open the show in an unrelated musical skit that involves a few young 
members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad guys take on extra chill on the ice. As Gaston, the consummate village 
baddie, Russian singles skater Victor Barshevtsev swoops and leaps menacingly, 
and delivers frequent flying kicks to his lackey LeFou (Joe Daysog), who 
obliges with belly flops into the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 And the two wolves that lurk in the dark forest outside the Beast's castle are 
made more threatening by athletic, almost violent lifts and throws of Russian 
pair skaters Olga Neizvestnaya and Sergei Zaitsev. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not familiar with the Disney film, be forewarned that it bears only 
a passing resemblance to the original folk tale about a beautiful and loyal 
daughter who voluntarily takes her father's place as prisoner in the castle of 
a mysterious beast, and with her love, eventually breaks the spell that binds 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 In Disney's hands, the hexed servants are transformed into household objects 
ranging from an amorous candlestick to a peevish mantle clock, and the whole 
lot of them have a convenient taste for splashy production numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the film's big numbers are re-created here, notably the "Be Our Guest" 
scene, in which Belle is entertained by a Ziegfield-style show of dinnerware. 
Chorus skaters decked out to resemble table settings bundled in glittering 
napkins and even fully laden tables perform standard ice-follies moves for 
Belle's entertainment, and cap it off with a full-scale can-can. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you think this silver is just for show, in the second act these same 
characters team up with other home accessories in a choreographed brawl with 
the villagers who storm the castle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the skaters they employ are certainly skilled, Walt Disney's World on 
Ice emphasizes spectacle and storytelling, not skating. If you prefer a 
showcase for professional-level figure skating, you are better off with 
something like the new Dorothy Hamill's Ice Capades. 
</P>
<P>
 There are times in this show when the skating and storytelling become 
uncomfortable partners, such as a tavern scene in which Neizvestnaya and 
Zaitsev perform an athletic ice dance. It is impressive to behold, but 
nevertheless seems out of place and interrupts the pacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the marriage is more successful than in previous "World on Ice" shows, 
like last year's "Double Feature," which relied heavily on a wham-bam 
variety-show format and technical effects. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, although it cost $6 million to produce (reportedly the most expensive 
of the past dozen World on Ice shows until being eclipsed by "Aladdin," which 
comes to the Southland next year), this show is fairly light on Vegas-type 
pyrotechnics, and much kinder to the senses. 
</P>
<P>
 The show runs today through Monday at the Los Angeles Sports Arena and 
Wednesday through Jan.23 at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Walt Disney's World on Ice Presents Beauty and the Beast" will be performed 
Wednesday and Jan. 20, at 7:30 p.m.; Jan. 21 at 1:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Jan. 22-23 
at noon, 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. at the Long Beach Arena, 300 E. Ocean Blvd.; $9.50 
to $15.50, limited rink-side seating available for $30. (310) 436-3661, (714)

DEVELOPMENT: CONTROVERSY OVER NAVAL HOSPITAL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The comments by Lakewood Mayor Larry Van Nostran (Times, Dec. 30) were so out 
of whack that I was moved for the first time ever to write a letter to the 
editor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Van Nostran states that the proposed shopping center on the Naval 
Hospital site will be a "business killer" for surrounding businesses. If the 
proposed Long Beach retail development draws retail spending from Lakewood 
businesses, it's because the Long Beach shopping center provides a more 
convenient, lower-priced, better service for the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what the free market system is all about. Let the consumers choose 
where they want to shop. Not politicians who stop competition by creating 
political barriers to entry. If the mayor is right, then conversely, by not 
building the center, consumers are being forced to pay higher prices, endure 
more inconvenience, travel a further distance, burn more gasoline, create more 
smog and probably consume more aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should consumers subsidize the owners? Barriers to trade have come down 
all over the world. Countries and cities must learn to compete in a free market 
system. Competition creates more business, which in turn benefits consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Long Beach has an obligation to its residents to maximize the tax 
revenue it can generate from retail sales so that it can provide sufficient 
police, fire, library and other services to its residents. Would Lakewood like 
to contribute to Long Beach the sales tax revenue lost by not building the 
center? 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, this plot of Long Beach land has served the men and women of 
our armed forces. The city of Long Beach never screamed that it wanted its land 
back so that it could build a shopping center and gain sales tax revenue. Now 
that the federal government no longer has a need for the property, the city of 
Long Beach should benefit for having done its part for the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 If Lakewood wants a say in the use of this property, then let it contribute to 
Long Beach an amount equal to one-half of the sales tax revenue Long Beach went 
without while the property was used as a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Next thing you know, Hawaiian Gardens is going to be telling Cerritos how to 
develop the Cerritos Towne Center.

 DOODLE TOO: As if those beleaguered board members at Carl Karcher Enterprises 
haven't had enough problems the past year, now someone's going after their 
Crazy Doodler Top. . . . The spinning toy comes with a kid's $1.99 happy meal 
at Carl's Jr. restaurants. But DoodleTop Co. of Carmel has filed a federal 
lawsuit, saying it has the trademark on a similar spinner. For now, Carl 
Karcher Enterprises is declining comment.

<P>
 FALSE START: How important is it to kick off a political campaign on the right 
foot? Huntington Beach activist Haydee Tillotson officially announced on 
Wednesday she'll run for the seat Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder is leaving 
(B7). But Tillotson's campaign people faxed the news media the wrong address, 
sending them scurrying across Huntington Beach to find her. . . . No serious 
damage, though: Tillotson is Wieder's own choice to succeed her. 
</P>
<P>
 LEAP OF FAITH: At his peak, track champion Dwight Stones could clear 7 feet 
routinely in the high jump. Now he wants to become the first 40-year-old to do 
it. . . . To get there, he's been working out since September at UC Irvine, not 
far from his home. Sunday, the 10-time national champion and former Olympic 
star launches his comeback at the Montreal Grand Prix Indoor Games. . . . Says 
Stones: "I am doing this to maximize my ability and pursue excellence. You can 
be the best you can be, no matter how old you are." 
</P>
<P>
 NO FISHING: It's not just the farmers who'd like more rain. So would some 
fishermen. If you were planning to attend Friday's grand opening of Santa Ana 
River Lakes, just off the Riverside Freeway in Anaheim, you'll have to wait. 
The opening date was set when officials figured the normal rainfall would fill 
it. But there has been little rain, and the three lakes there are only 
one-quarter full. . . . The Orange County Water District is pumping in water, 
but it will take several weeks to fill. A February opening for fishermen is 
more likely.

JOHN BRADLEY; LAST OF MARINES WHO RAISED U.S. FLAG ON IWO JIMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Bradley, 70, the last survivor of those who helped raise the flag on Iwo 
Jima in the Pulitzer Prize-winning World War II photograph. A Navy pharmacist's 
mate second class, Bradley helped five Marines raise the flag atop Mt.Suribachi 
on Feb. 23, 1945. It was the first time the American flag had flown over 
Japanese territory and became a symbol of Americans in battle. Associated Press 
photographer Joe Rosenthal's prize-winning photo of the moment (actually a 
staged second raising with a bigger flag) became the model for the Iwo Jima 
Memorial near Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. Three of the six men in 
the photograph died in battle. The other two war survivors, Ira Hayes and Rene 
Gagnon, died in 1955 and 1979, respectively. Bradley, who worked in his 
family-owned suburban Milwaukee funeral home, maintained that he had done 
nothing heroic and refused interviews for more than 40 years. On Tuesday in 
Antigo, Wis., of a stroke.

VENTURA SCHOOL SWIM TEAM COACH MAY FACE FIRING; INVESTIGATION: POLICE HAVE 
BEGUN PROBE OF DALE HAHN. ALLEGATIONS ARE UNSPECIFIED. SEVERAL STUDENTS COME TO 
HIS DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS and MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura school officials are considering the dismissal of a Ventura High 
School swim coach who is under investigation for unspecified allegations of 
misconduct, the coach's attorney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Police Department also has begun an investigation of Coach Dale 
Hahn because school officials contacted officers in mid-December, said Sgt. Bob 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the coach's troubles, several high school swimmers and their parents 
came to Hahn's defense, saying they believe school officials are overreacting 
and that their coach has done nothing inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn's attorney, Richard Schwab, said the Ventura Unified School District 
officials notified his client of their investigation in December when they put 
him on paid leave. Schwab said district officials have not informed him of any 
specific accusations against his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suspensions are limited, under the education code, to certain types of 
charges which would be like immoral conduct and things of that nature, or if 
you've been charged with criminal offenses," Schwab said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said Hahn, a teacher for 20 years in Ventura schools, has done 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels there's no substance" to the allegations, Schwab said. "He's never 
done anything unprofessional, inappropriate or otherwise" toward any student. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-year-old Hahn was at home Wednesday, but declined comment. He teaches 
chemistry and physical science in addition to coaching water polo and the 
varsity swim team at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the district said the school board in a closed session Tuesday 
night took the first step toward firing an unidentified teacher and suspending 
that teacher without pay until the dismissal is final. But attorney Mary Jo 
McGrath refused to name the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the board members decided Tuesday to notify the teacher that 
they intend to suspend and ultimately fire the teacher, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has acted very aggressively and thoroughly to investigate the 
situation. I think their community should be pleased in the way in which they 
responded," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's action comes nearly a year after Ventura High football Coach 
Harvey Kochel was convicted of having unlawful sex with a 15-year-old student 
and sentenced to two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Kochel case, the district came under fire for not taking swift action 
on longstanding knowledge of inappropriate sexual behavior by the school's 
winning football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn from any situation," Ventura schools Supt. Joseph Spirito said 
Wednesday. "I think we became more aggressive. I think we became more 
knowledgeable. The bottom line is, we have a zero-based tolerance of any kind 
of behavior that puts any of our children in jeopardy or makes them feel 
uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 In early December, the Ventura school district hired McGrath, an attorney who 
specializes in investigations leading to dismissals of tenured teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath said the board's action Tuesday followed her investigation into 
allegations against the teacher. She described her inquiry as "broad based" and 
said it involved interviews with about 50 students, former students, teachers 
and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Before school administrators can suspend a teacher without pay, McGrath said 
they must give the teacher the right to request an informal meeting with the 
district's personnel director. And the school district cannot fire a teacher 
without giving the individual an opportunity to have a full hearing by a 
three-member state Commission on Professional Competence. It could be several 
months before such a hearing is scheduled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ventura police said they have barely begun their investigation. "At 
this point, it's far too early to say if we can establish any criminal acts," 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents and students who know Hahn said they believe the school district 
has gone too far and acted too quickly. Others say they find it difficult to 
believe the myriad rumors regarding the veteran coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do believe that because of this thing with Coach Kochel, they've blown 
this thing way out of proportion and ruined a man's career," said Lynn Sousa, 
the parent of a girl on the swim team. 
</P>
<P>
 Two female swimmers said they believe school officials are trying to counter 
community criticism of their handling of the Coach Kochel situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're taking this so seriously and overreacting because of Kochel," said 
one of the girls who is trying out for the swim team this year. "But Coach Hahn 
is nothing like Kochel." 
</P>
<P>
 The two girls, both juniors, said Hahn had never acted improperly toward them. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the coach told the swim team and students in his science classes in 
early November that "there were allegations made against him by a few girls." 
</P>
<P>
 But he told students the allegations had nothing to do with physical or sexual 
harassment and called them a "misunderstanding," said one of the girls, who is 
a second-year swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another swimmer, 16-year-old Marrie Murphy, said that Assistant Principal 
Helena Torrez-Reaves told swim team members in a meeting Wednesday that Coach 
Hahn would not be back this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said she had initially heard from other students that Hahn had been 
sent home because a girl reported to school officials that he had put his arm 
around her. 
</P>
<P>
 But Torrez-Reaves told students Wednesday that additional allegations had been 
brought by a former student who said she had also had problems with Hahn, 
Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said she had never seen Hahn act inappropriately toward students. "The 
closest thing he would do is put his arm around you or pat your back," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Clark, a 15-year-old sophomore on the water polo team, also said he had 
not seen the coach touch students inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dan said he sometimes saw girls hugging the coach in the school hallways. 
"I've seen lots of the girls go up to him and give him hugs and flirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents and school officials said they are concerned that the allegations 
will damage the school's image and hurt student morale, especially because the 
controversy comes so soon after the well-publicized Kochel case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dale is an adult and he's going to deal with whatever comes at him," said 
Turner Clark, Dan's father and president of the school's Aquatics Booster Club. 
"But we're concerned about the students and the school."

PAY RAISE BACKED FOR TOP COUNTY COURT OFFICER; GOVERNMENT: THE FOUR-JUDGE PANEL 
RECOMMENDS THE INCREASE FOR SHEILA GONZALEZ, WHO EARNS $96,624, PLUS PERKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight months after backing away from a proposed $23,000 pay raise for the 
executive officer of the local courts, a committee of Ventura County judges has 
recommended that Sheila Gonzalez's salary be increased. 
</P>
<P>
 And during a private meeting today, the full Ventura County bench will decide 
on whether to take the committee's advice.  
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Superior Court Judge Melinda A. Johnson confirmed Wednesday that the 
four-judge committee has recommended the pay boost, and the courts' Superior 
and Municipal judges will vote on the item this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, 50, now earns a base salary of $96,624, plus about $25,000 in perks 
and benefits. Johnson refused to divulge the size of the raise being 
recommended for Gonzalez, as did Superior Court Judge Richard D. Aldrich, a 
member of the committee recommending the pay hike. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was formed solely to decide this issue.  
</P>
<P>
 But an anti-tax crusader said the raise should be rejected if it is anywhere 
near the $23,000 salary hike considered for Gonzalez last March. 
</P>
<P>
 Jere Robings, who resigned Wednesday as president of the Ventura County 
Alliance of Taxpayers to run for a seat on the county Board of Supervisors, 
criticized any raise for Gonzalez that exceeds 3% -- or about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said a higher raise would place Gonzalez's salary above those of the 
state attorney general and the Ventura County district attorney and on a level 
with the governor and state Supreme Court justices.  
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor John K. Flynn had also criticized the proposed $23,000 raise 
last year, but said Wednesday he wanted to reserve comment this time until he 
finds out the size of the raise to be considered today for Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 He did say, however, that he would denounce it if it is in the $23,000 range. 
"That seemed to be rather excessive," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, through a spokeswoman, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Her supporters say she has never asked for a raise. But they say she is a 
tireless, creative administrator who might be lured by another county if her 
pay remains constant. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been at her current salary rate for three years, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of two judges from both the Municipal and Superior courts was 
formed to study Gonzalez's pay after the proposal to increase her salary by 
$23,000 met opposition from Robings, Flynn and at least one Superior Court 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee compared Gonzalez's duties -- including the number of people she 
supervises and the scope of her responsibilities -- to those of other court 
administrators across the state, Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 It found that she had streamlined the Ventura County courts administration and 
saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process, said Aldrich. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said Gonzalez serves as court clerk as well as executive 
officer of the Superior and Municipal courts, eliminating the need for two 
additional administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most counties in California do not have full administrative consolidation," 
Aldrich said. "We're the only court that does." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it only fair to attempt to bring her salary in line with other 
counties of comparable size and other courts of comparable size," Aldrich said. 
"We are very blessed, in my opinion, in this county to have someone of her 
caliber doing the job she is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Robings, however, pointed out that Gonzalez has deputy administrators who 
oversee the various operations of the courts. She employs two assistant 
executive officers and four deputy executive officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most officials agree that Gonzalez has done a good job running the court 
administration the past seven years. In November, the National Center for State 
Courts honored her with the 1993 Warren E. Burger Award, considered to be the 
top prize in America for a court administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 She holds numerous state and national judicial committee posts, including 
heading an advisory committee of court administrators for the state judicial 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Under her direction, the Ventura County courts have received the Ralph N. 
Kleps Award in each of the three years it has been handed out, Aldrich said. He 
said the award is given to courts in California that have demonstrated the most 
creative management.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County has won that award ever since it has been established," 
Aldrich said. "Sheila Gonzalez is the reason we have won it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even her supporters acknowledge that they can understand why the public might 
criticize giving a sizable raise to someone already earning more than $96,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "To anybody earning less than that, it seems phenomenal," Presiding Superior 
Court Judge Johnson conceded. "It seems unjust." 
</P>
<P>
 But in light of the money Gonzalez has saved the county and Gonzalez's 
achievements in streamlining her staff and management team, Johnson said she 
deserves to be well paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we would do without her," Johnson said. "I just shudder to 
think about it."

FEDERAL JUDGE REFUSES TO HALT WORK ON MICROWAVE TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Wednesday refused to stop government work crews from 
continuing construction of a microwave tower on top of Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 A group calling itself the Environmental Coalition of Ojai filed suit in U. S. 
District Court in Los Angeles on Friday, asking that workers be prevented from 
finishing the 98-foot weather station and that more detailed environmental 
studies be performed. 
</P>
<P>
 The landowners are afraid that low-level radiation waves emitted from the 
tower may cause cancer or other diseases. Not enough research has been 
conducted to show that the radiation levels are safe, they argued in court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 But U. S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter ruled late Wednesday that there was 
no need for the 10-day restraining order because government plans do not call 
for the weather-tracking tower to be switched on before Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he scheduled a Jan. 31 hearing to hear arguments from government 
attorneys and lawyers representing actor Larry Hagman, landowner David Hedman 
and other coalition members who filed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plaintiff hasn't met any of the elements required to get a preliminary 
injunction or a temporary restraining order," Assistant U. S. Atty. Donna 
Everett said. "The agency conducted all of the (environmental) assessments that 
were required." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter ordered the U. S. attorney's office to provide the administrative 
record of the entire project by Jan. 20. A court official said Hatter would 
review the voluminous government record before the Jan. 31 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred M. Blum, attorney for the environmental coalition, said Hatter's denial 
of the restraining order was not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would admit there's no emergency," the San Francisco attorney said. But if 
the denial "was a foreshadowing of his feelings in the case, he would not have 
set a quick briefing schedule, which he did do." 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers opposing the restraining order, Everett said the radar system 
is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was considered, and the radar is not dangerous," she said in an 
interview. "There have been numerous surveys done, and they conclude that there 
are no harmful effects to the environment or to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman, whose sprawling hilltop estate lies in the shadow of the tower, took a 
wait-and-see attitude Wednesday night toward Hatter's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wheels of justice move exceedingly slow and grind exceedingly fine," he 
said from New York. "With them, it's always three steps forward and two steps 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedman said that despite the ruling Wednesday, the Environmental Coalition of 
Ojai will not be deterred. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not totally unexpected," he said. "We realize it's a David and Goliath 
fight. The big hearing is the 31st, and we'll put all of our resources into 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The radar system, which resembles a black scaffold and sphere, sprang up early 
last month on property owned by William and Ernestine Kee, after the Kees 
leased a portion of their ranch to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, many of their neighbors mobilized and vowed to "topple the 
tower." 
</P>
<P>
 By late December, they had won a temporary restraining order in Ventura County 
Superior Court that prevented the Kees from allowing the government across the 
easement they have on the land of neighbor Agnes Baron. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U. S. attorney's office filed condemnation papers against that 
easement last week, allowing construction of the radar system to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the federal court rules Jan. 31 that detailed environmental analyses must 
be completed before the Sulphur Mountain project goes on line, it could affect 
other Doppler radar systems being erected across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum said he and his clients are optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Judge Hatter rules against us on the 31st, that's a setback," Blum said. 
"This isn't."

POTENTIAL JURORS FOR PIROLI TRIAL QUIZZED; COURT: JUDGE'S QUESTIONING IN THE 
EMBEZZLEMENT CASE FOCUSES ON FEELINGS ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF PRIESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Potential jurors were quizzed on religion, drugs and bookkeeping Wednesday as 
jury selection continued in the trial of a Simi Valley priest accused of 
embezzling $60,000 from two Ventura County churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Father David Dean Piroli, 37, faces two counts of theft, following his arrest 
by Hollywood police in May, 1992, when he was found in his church car with a 
young man, small amounts of cocaine and $10,000 in cash and parishioners' 
checks.  
</P>
<P>
 Another $50,000 in collection money was found in Piroli's rooms at the rectory 
of St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley, and prosecutors have charged he took 
the cash from that church and from Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy, his previous 
posting. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli plans to defend himself with counter-allegations that the collection 
money was actually taken by his supervisor, Father James McKeon, head pastor at 
St. Peter Claver. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Richard Beada has said he plans to prove that McKeon planted 
the cash in Piroli's car and rooms at the rectory in an attempt to frame the 
younger priest.  
</P>
<P>
 McKeon has been unavailable for comment on that charge, or on the allegation 
Beada made in court that he was seen frequenting a gay bathhouse in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Allan Steele began wading through a pool of 
more than 70 potential jurors, seeking 12 members and a handful of alternates 
for a trial that is expected to last four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the jury box, Steele seated 12 candidates, ranging from an unemployed 
acting student to a Navy environmental biologist, and asked them the customary 
questions about their jobs, hobbies and any personal history they had as either 
crime victims or criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then with each, he zeroed in: 
</P>
<P>
 "Would the fact that Piroli is wearing a priest's collar give you any 
concern?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe that priests are entitled to any more credibility because 
they're priests?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you feel that your religious convictions are such that you could not under 
any circumstances find this defendant guilty?" 
</P>
<P>
 "If the evidence indicates in some fashion there were illegal narcotics in 
some way connected to the defendant, does that make him automatically guilty of 
what he's been charged with in this case?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although a couple of potential jurors paused as if to think carefully about 
the questions, all answered no; none of these factors would bias their 
judgment, they said.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, none of the jurors has been placed on the panel or rejected. 
Questioning of these 12 candidates and others is scheduled to continue today at 
10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Wednesday, Steele imposed a gag order on the attorneys in the case, 
instructing defense attorney Beada and Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace not to 
discuss the case publicly.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SOMIS; PACKINGHOUSE FINED $27,000 OVER LABOR LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials Wednesday fined a Somis packing plant $27,000 and temporarily 
shut down the operation for allegedly failing to provide workers' compensation 
insurance for its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 During the second day of a countywide sweep aimed at cracking down on labor 
law violations, the Ojai-Tapo Citrus Assn. was ordered to stop work until it 
insured its employees against on-the-job accidents. State records showed that 
the company's workers' compensation policy expired as of Jan. 1, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But operators of the packing plant said they believe the fine and citation are 
in error. Contrary to the findings of state investigators, company officials 
said the policy had been renewed and was in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we run a pretty good operation here," said Al Bakalian, general 
manager of the packinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second day in a row, workers from the state labor commissioner's 
office and the Division of Occupational Safety and Health inspected farms, 
nurseries and other agricultural operations throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators are members of the Targeted Industries Partnership Program, 
established in late 1992 to beef up enforcement of laws designed to protect 
farm workers and other laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, inspectors from the joint enforcement and educational program have 
conducted more than 600 agricultural inspections statewide and issued more than 
400 citations resulting in more than $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, investigators visited Pleasant Valley Flowers in Oxnard. They 
told owner Wim Zwinkels that they would return to do an audit to ensure that a 
handful of employees had received the proper amount of overtime pay. Otherwise, 
the flower grower received a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically try to keep everybody happy," Zwinkels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that afternoon, investigators visited a field near Camarillo where 
workers stood bent from the waist, cutting and packing celery into cardboard 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew was under the supervision of a farm labor contractor from Salinas who 
allegedly required workers to buy their own knives and other equipment needed 
to work the field. Investigators required the contractor to reimburse the 
workers for the costs of the equipment, a total of about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost of doing business was being shifted to the employees, and that's 
illegal in California," said Tony Guilin, a deputy labor commissioner based in 
Ventura. "And we're talking one labor contractor out of several that we know 
are doing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they expect to continue their countywide inspections today.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SCHOOL DISTRICT ASKS AGAIN FOR CITY WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to overturn an earlier decision, the Oxnard Union High School District 
will ask a state planning agency next week to approve hooking up the new Oxnard 
High School campus to city water. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials will appear before the Local Agency Formation Commission at 
9 a.m. Jan. 19 in the county government center in Ventura.They will ask 
commissioners to reverse their previous decision against annexing the new 
school site to the Calleguas Municipal Water District, which supplies water to 
the city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, a state-sponsored panel that regulates all changes in 
boundaries for cities and other agencies, voted 3 to 2 in November against the 
school district's request to annex the new campus located near Patterson and 
Gonzales roads to Calleguas. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, commissioners argued that the district's decision to build the 
new school in the middle of agricultural fields flouted county efforts to 
preserve farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 Annexing the campus to the Calleguas water district would spur further 
development in that agricultural area, LAFCO officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If LAFCO upholds its earlier decision against the annexation, Oxnard school 
officials plan to drill a well on the site to supply the school's water, said 
Richard W. Canady, the district's assistant business manager. Drilling the well 
would cost about $80,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials have said they would prefer to be annexed to Calleguas 
because that water comes from state reservoirs, a cleaner and more reliable 
source than wells. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus is slated to open this fall to replace Oxnard High School on Fifth 
Street. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; TOURISM, ECONOMIC CHANGES APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Oxnard has officially eliminated its economic development 
department, agreeing instead to fund a nonprofit Greater Oxnard Economic 
Development Corp. that will open its doors next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate move aimed at boosting tourism in Oxnard, the city has also 
agreed to provide funding for a Greater Oxnard and Harbors Tourism Bureau.The 
new tourism bureau replaces the Oxnard Convention and Visitor's Bureau, which 
ceased operations in 1991 when the city stopped subsidizing it during budget 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Oxnard City Council approved a contract with the new economic 
development corporation and agreed to provide $266,000 for the five-month 
start-up period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The creation of a private development corporation is a natural evolution," 
said Mayor Manuel Lopez. "It bodes well for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kinney, Oxnard's economic development director, will resign from his 
position with the city to direct the new agency, which will operate from the 
Gordon House in downtown Oxnard's Heritage Square. 
</P>
<P>
 The council named Councilmen Andres Herrera and Michael Plisky to serve as 
city representatives on the corporation's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved spending $211,000 to fund the first five months of 
the Greater Oxnard and Harbors Tourism Bureau. The council will later seek a 1% 
increase in the city's transient occupancy tax to provide for future funding. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement, the visitors bureau will have to obtain $37,500 of 
its start-up funds from the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinney said the new bureau will sponsor "a full range of activities to get 
Oxnard back on the tourist's map." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bedford Pinkard lauded the decision to create the new tourism 
bureau. "Oxnard's a well-kept secret, and we can't keep it secret any longer."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; GAY WORKER WILL RETURN TO NAVAL BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gay civilian employee at the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station on 
Wednesday accepted an offer to return to work at the base, six months after he 
left his post claiming that he was harassed because he is homosexual, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Swann, 35, accepted the offer to return to the base beginning next 
week after a six-month leave.Swann claimed that he was being harassed and 
physically threatened by co-workers because of his sexual orientation and 
because of his open support for a repeal of the ban against gays in the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port Hueneme man worked at the base for 12 years as a missile program 
analyst before voluntarily leaving his post last June. Swann, who is being 
represented in the case by the American Civil Liberties Union, could not be 
reached for comment Wednesday. Alan Friel and Jon Davidson, Swann's two ACLU 
lawyers, did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Alan Alpers, a Navy spokesman, Swann will be reassigned from the 
Strike Systems Department, where he claims he was harassed, to the base's 
comptroller's office. He will retain his civilian GS-11 civil service rank and 
will earn from $35,300 to $46,200 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the Navy finding a 'make-work' job. As everyone knows, we are in 
a downsizing mode here," Alpers said. "It took awhile to find a position at 
that level with a similar level of responsibility. Believe me, jobs like this 
just aren't sitting around here unfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpers said the Navy offered to place Swann in the new job as part of his 
rights provided under the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 The act guarantees that employers must provide "reasonable accommodations" to 
employees suffering from certain physical or mental disabilities, which in 
Swann's case includes the alleged harassment. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; STUDY CLEARS WAY FOR WATER PLANT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Ojai Valley Sanitary District have approved a final 
environmental impact report that paves the way for the $27-million renovation 
of its waste-water treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which serves about 12,000 customers between north Ventura and 
Ojai, was ordered by state water officials in 1990 to upgrade the system after 
discharge samples failed to meet standards. 
</P>
<P>
 With the adoption of the final environmental report, the district will begin 
looking for $20 million it hopes to borrow from a state revolving fund to pay 
for the improvements, General Manager Eric Oltmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the loan package is approved this spring, construction bids could go out as 
soon as June, Oltmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the renovation would take 30 months, leaving the district six months 
behind its July, 1996, deadline to upgrade the system. The district could be 
fined $25,000 for every day it fails to comply with the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers would probably pay about $10 a month extra for the next 20 years to 
fund the improvements, Oltmann said. The average bill for a household now is 
about $22, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Stan Greene said the renovation would help both the district and 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to clean up the water in the Ventura River," he said. "There will 
be more oxygen available for fish and it will cut down on nutrients for 
non-native plants that clog the river." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of directors also is seeking applications to replace 
Director James Brady, who resigned Wednesday because he is moving to Northern 
California to accept a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member panel, which oversees an annual budget of about $4 million, 
will probably name a replacement next month. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; NEGLIGENCE CLAIM IS REJECTED IN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council has unanimously rejected a claim for $1.5 million by the 
family of a 19-year-old man who was stabbed to death at a weekend party last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The family of Jasper Fitzgerald, an Ohio man who was killed last May while 
visiting his boyhood home in Ojai, claimed that negligence on the part of 
officers responding to a call at the party contributed to the man's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald was stabbed to death by Ryan Burchell, a 19-year-old Ojai man who 
told investigators that Fitzgerald had harassed him earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Burchell later pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to 
12 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said in the complaint that officers "failed to follow leads or 
even do a cursory check of the area" where screams were reported, in part 
contributing to Fitzgerald's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs named Ventura County and the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department in the claim in addition to the city of Ojai. County supervisors 
have yet to hear the action, but Robi G. Klein, director of the Risk Management 
Agency for the county, said he will recommend that the claim be denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim seeks $500,000 in civil damages and another $1 million in punitive 
damages for Fitzgerald's father, mother and sister. Most claims against public 
agencies are routinely rejected and are followed by a formal lawsuit. JEFF

 T here's little window slits in the dorm. I never look through them, out at 
I-5 or Magic Mtn, 'cause it's like a taunt: "This is what you used to have." 
Sorry to be so morose . . . the system is grinding us down, my sweet wife & I . 
. . it gets to the point where, wearily, you just take whatever the court rams 
down your throat. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Brian Frederick Simpson, my new pen pal, writes a good letter. But then, not 
many robbery suspects awaiting trial in L.A. County took classes at UCLA. This 
correspondence came from the Pitchess Honor Rancho in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who is 40, has a rap sheet that dates back at least 14 years, 
graduating from petty theft to burglary to robbery. A 1986 probation report 
recounts that he was arrested outside an apartment with rubber gloves and a pry 
bar. The prose is as flat as Joe Friday: "Defendant acknowledged his 
wrongdoings stating it was a foolish, spontaneous and desperate act resulting 
from his poor financial condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Spontaneous? In Simpson's car, police found goods taken in a burglary an hour 
earlier. They later found other stolen items and traced them to four 
burglaries. The victims included Simpson's father and three other people "known 
to the defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 And now Brian Simpson, facing a possible 17 years in prison, wants to be my 
friend. He wants my help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't know if I can help. Not sure I want to. But as crime-weary Californians 
ponder the marquee anti-crime measure known as "three strikes and you're out," 
the Simpson case is worth a good, hard look. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson isn't a newsworthy criminal. He's no Richard Alan Davis. But if the 
"three strikes" measure were law today, Brian Simpson wouldn't be facing 17 
years, he'd be looking at life. This would cost taxpayers $25,000 per year. Say 
he lives to age 81. That's $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is a Valley boy who grew up in Tarzana. His passions, it seems, were 
music and drugs. To augment his record collection he pilfered LPs. To support 
his taste for crystal methamphetamine he did burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 For years he's been in and out of custody. The last time Simpson entered 
prison was in January, 1989. A few months later he met a woman who'd come to 
Chino to visit a brother and do Christian outreach. Brian and Christine were 
married in '90, well before his release in November, '91. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved in with Christine and her children in Sylmar. Brian sought drug 
counseling but didn't stick with it. Christine's prayers weren't answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has sent me seven or eight letters. He likens himself to "Dr. 
Jekyll/Mr. Hyde," blaming his problems on his "slavish addiction, fatal 
affinity" for methamphetamine. He pleads to be placed in a rehab program, but 
even his own attorney says it may be too late for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his record, Simpson's troubles may be rooted in more than drugs. 
Criminologists suggest that burglary itself can be addictive, much like 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson was last arrested May 14 while (allegedly) burglarizing the home of a 
95-year-old Santa Monica woman. Authorities say he was surprised by a boarder 
who happened to be a highway patrolman. Simpson (allegedly) struck the 
patrolman with a Christmas stocking loaded with valuables, including a metal 
box. Thus, the charges include robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the "three strikes" measure should think about this scene: the 
common burglar surprised in the act. Strangely, "three strikes" lumps several 
"serious felonies" that are nonviolent with violent crimes. In other words, the 
two-time loser is facing life if he takes a hostage -- and life if he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block, not known for sympathizing with criminals, has 
questioned the wisdom of "three strikes" because of its cost and its failure to 
discriminate between violent and nonviolent crimes. Daniel Glaser, USC 
professor emeritus of sociology and past president of the American Society of 
Criminology, also has grave doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of this get-tough measure seem blinded to the logic that such tough 
sentencing may actually encourage criminals to commit far greater crimes, such 
as the murder of witnesses to reduce the possibility of getting caught. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Simpson's trial is scheduled to start. He was hoping to be placed in 
the California Rehabilitation Center, a prison drug treatment program. But 
because Simpson's minimum possible sentence exceeds six years, he wouldn't be 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine prays that, somehow, her husband may find redemption. She finds 
strength in her faith that Brian "has accepted the Lord and is trying to turn 
around spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's latest letter arrived Wednesday. It began: 
</P>
<P>
 Can I tell you something man-to-man? I'm scared to death. I just am . . .

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; GAS STATION'S 12 FLAGS RUN AFOUL OF 
CITY CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Their 881-page municipal code regulates everything from how to prune oak trees 
to how to tile a roof, but Thousand Oaks City Council members were at a loss 
this week when presented with a new conundrum: how to define patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
 To recent immigrant Al Samimi, the answer is simple. Patriotism, he told the 
council, means love for America. And he wants to express that love by flying a 
dozen American flags around the gas station he owns at the corner of Rancho 
Road and Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the city's code enforcement officers, Samimi's patriotism smacks of 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that the display violates a city law prohibiting the use of flags 
in advertising displays. And they asked Samimi, who has owned the gas station 
for nearly eight years, to take down the flags or face hefty fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented with both sides of the case at Tuesday's meeting, council members 
expressed ambivalence. They directed city staff to look into the issue and 
return with a report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly we all revere the American flag," Councilman Alex Fiore said. "If 
you got a huge . . . American flag and shined a big light on it, I think that 
would be beautiful and everyone would love it. The question is, when you have a 
lot of flags everywhere . . . that to me, is not an expression of First 
Amendment rights, but a device to attract people." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' sign ordinance allows businesses to put up pennants, balloons 
and banners -- with city permission -- for grand openings and special sales. 
But Samimi never applied for a permit to plant a dozen large flags around his 
corner parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand if they say I must remove graffiti, because that's ugly, but 
the flag is something that gives you enjoyment and lifts your spirit," said 
Samimi, an American citizen who emigrated from Iran eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted that the flags were pure expressions of patriotism, not 
advertising -- though he admitted that the stars and stripes match perfectly 
with the gas station's new name, American Gas & Automotive. 
</P>
<P>
 Samimi will have up to two weeks to comply with the city's demands that he 
take down his flags, Code Enforcement Officer Don LaVoie said. If he persists 
in flying the flags, he could be cited for a violation of the municipal code, 
which carries a fine of up to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Samimi could also be liable for the city's costs in prosecuting the case, 
which could run up to $5,000, officials said. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE: BOARD TO CONSIDER TRUST FUND FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors next week will consider a proposal to 
put sales tax money raised from Proposition 172 into a trust fund for law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard said she will ask the board at its meeting on Tuesday 
to approve a proposal to establish a "Public Safety Augmentation Fund." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, voters statewide passed the proposition to make permanent a 
temporary half-cent sales tax, with the stipulation that the money be earmarked 
for public safety purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the supervisors have pledged several times to use the money for law 
enforcement, local taxpayer groups said they are fearful that the money will be 
diverted to other county services. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-cent sales tax is expected to raise about $12 million for Ventura 
County government between January and July this year. Overall, the county could 
receive between $26 million and $28 million in tax revenue annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to setting up the trust fund, Howard is also requesting that some 
of the money be allocated specifically to hire more sheriff's deputies in the 
county's unincorporated areas. TINA DAUNT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; OFFICIALS TO TAKE VOTE ON STUDENT BUS 
FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley school officials have agreed to vote on a proposal to charge 
parents $300 per year for student bus transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fees are approved by the board at its Feb. 1 meeting, the Simi Valley 
Unified School District would become the second in Ventura County to charge for 
busing.The Conejo Valley Unified School District adopted a similar plan in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley school board discussed the plan at its regular meeting 
Tuesday. With no opposition voiced, the board scheduled the issue for a vote. 
Parents would be charged $300 for the first child in a family, $200 for the 
second, $100 for the third and $50 for a fourth sibling to ride the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related budget item, the board also is scheduled to vote next month on 
whether to move sixth-period athletics to after-school hours. Once sports are 
shifted to after school, the district could legally charge those students an 
additional $90 a year for transportation to and from competitive events, said 
Supt. Mary Beth Wolford. 
</P>
<P>
 The district needs to cut about $2.5 million to replenish reserves and balance 
the budget at $77.1 million, officials said. The board is holding special 
budget study sessions periodically and scheduling items for formal votes as 
decisions are reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cuts that could be decided at the next meeting include eliminating 
teacher advisers who spend one or two class periods a day working with students 
who are frequently absent. BRENDA DAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCIL TOUGHENS ANTI-GRAFFITI LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing its crackdown on graffiti, the Simi Valley City Council has toughen 
city laws, including making parents liable for up to $10,000 in damages and 
fines resulting from their children's vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal changes, which will take effect in late February, also ban the sale 
of spray paint, etching tools and wide-tip markers to minors.Under the updated 
law, the city is offering a $1,000 reward to people who offer information that 
helps arrest and convict vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendments are the latest actions in an effort by the city to strengthen 
its 4-year-old anti-graffiti ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,500 graffiti incidents have been reported to police since 1990, 
and the vandalism caused more than $200,000 in damage in a recent seven-month 
period, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the city has added a staff member to patrol streets in 
search of graffiti, contracted a local company to remove the marks within 24 
hours and transferred responsibility of the program from the city's 
Environmental Services Department to Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community and the council have been very supportive in moving forward to 
wipe out graffiti," said Public Works Director Ron Coons. "We only hope these 
efforts will thwart the vandals from continuing." 
</P>
<P>
 Coons encouraged Simi Valley residents who spot graffiti to call the city's 
graffiti hot line at 583-6333. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SCHILLO ASKS COUNTY TO INCREASE 
SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Complaining that Thousand Oaks taxpayers often end up subsidizing less 
affluent cities, Councilman Frank Schillo is urging the Board of Supervisors to 
spend money from a countywide half-cent sales tax on services that benefit 
Thousand Oaks, at least indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters approved a permanent extension of the sales tax last fall.The money, 
which was earmarked for public safety, will help fund additional staff or 
equipment for the Sheriff's Department, and the public defender and district 
attorney's offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Thousand Oaks maintains a separate contract with the Sheriff's 
Department to provide police services in city limits, the city will not benefit 
directly if the county uses the money to hire more deputies or buy more patrol 
cars for other areas, Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech before the City Council late Tuesday, he said Thousand Oaks 
officials should lobby for the money to be spent on programs that would help 
the city indirectly -- such as lowering the crime rate in nearby unincorporated 
areas. "We should try for the whole county to be classified as No. 1 in 
safety," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, who is expected to announce today that he is running for the Board of 
Supervisors, said he figures that Thousand Oaks will contribute fully 25% of 
the county's receipts from the half-cent sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to realize that in addition to paying for all our own police 
services," Councilman Alex Fiore said, "we have the privilege of paying for 
protection in other cities. It seems only fair that of the money earmarked for 
public safety, something should be in the pot to benefit the city of Thousand 
Oaks." STEPHANIE SIMON

$500,000 FIRE DESTROYS GARDENING SUPPLY STORE; THOUSAND OAKS: OWNERS SEE THEIR 
HOPES FOR A GOOD YEAR DASHED BY THE BLAZE, WHICH STARTED IN A DUMPSTER. ARSON 
HAS NOT BEEN RULED OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reiner Norpchen spent two years building his Thousand Oaks gardening supply 
store. In the short time it took him to drive from his home to the store 
Wednesday morning, it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All that remained after an early morning fire tore through the shop were a few 
charred reminders of his hard work -- a stone fountain, handmade wood-paneled 
doors and a sign above the front gate carved with the store's name: Reiner's. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began about 2 a.m. in a dumpster about 50 feet behind the business, 
which sells and services lawn mowers and tractors. Investigators have not 
determined how the fire began, but have not ruled out arson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were just turning around for us," said Norpchen, who turns 64 today 
and has owned the store for 12 years. "It's going to be very difficult just to 
start all over again. This is just awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the Foothill Drive store and its contents were valued at 
about $500,000. By the time firefighters arrived, officials said, all they 
could do was contain the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could see the flames from a long way before they even got there," said 
Ventura County Fire Capt. Charles Sitton, who was in charge of the mop-up 
Wednesday morning. "It was fully involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatchers were alerted to the fire after alarms at the store went off and a 
resident of a nearby apartment called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than 50 firefighters with seven engines two hours to bring the 
blaze under control, a Fire Department spokeswoman said. Even a brush fire 
strike team was dispatched to the blaze because vegetation separated the store 
from an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The dumpster where the blaze began sat at the base of a grassy hill behind the 
K mart on Hampshire Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Terrinoni, operations manager of K mart, said his store has repeatedly had 
problems with vandalism and people digging through dumpsters in the alley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practically every day we have to send someone back there to clean up the 
mess," he said. "I'm sure someone was rummaging back there or hanging out in 
the alley and tossed a cigarette or something into the dumpster." 
</P>
<P>
 For Norpchen, the fire could not have come at a worse time, since the store's 
peak sales period is only weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The season for us starts in February," said Shirley Norpchen, 61, who worked 
in the store with her husband and a mechanic. "The way things went over 
Christmas, we could tell this was going to be a good year for us. But now all 
that's changed." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the couple had not had time to discuss the loss with an insurance 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess our only hope is to get ourselves relocated and try to salvage this 
season," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Reiner Norpchen poked through the ashes of the structure he 
had built, avoiding its metal girders, which had melted in the intense heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think maybe our file cabinet made it through this," he said. "Other than 
that, I don't know. This thing was so intense that if anything survived, it 
would be a miracle."

BOY SHOT IN NECK; NEIGHBOR HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old Ventura boy was shot in the neck Wednesday by a 20-year-old man 
who lived across the street, police said, in what they described as part of 
long-running feud. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, identified by police as Kevin Natale, was shot with a large caliber 
handgun about 7:45 p.m., in his house on Dolphin Court in the Ventura Keys 
neighborhood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin was taken by ambulance to Ventura County Medical Center, where the boy 
was listed in serious condition late Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard hysterical screaming and someone banged on the door," said neighbor 
Marsha Weber. "The girl said, 'Help me! Help me! My brother's been shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Weber said she started to cross the street to help but was stopped by police 
officers with guns drawn who ordered her to go back inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were responding to shots fired," said Sgt. Robert Nustad of the Ventura 
Police Department. "We still had the shooter at large, and we knew that he 
lived across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 As police searched the area, Kevin's mother gave her son first aid while 
waiting for paramedics, a neighbor said. His mother is a registered nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after Kevin was taken from the house by paramedics, the police received a 
call from the suspect who wanted to turn himself in to authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, who police identified as Brian Adams, had run down a bike path 
and made the call a few blocks away at a public phone. Nustad said Adams was 
arrested at the phone booth without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are unsure of a specific motive but indicated that they are 
aware of an ongoing dispute between the neighbors.

$5.5 MILLION IN ART OFFERED IF MUSEUM RELOCATES; THOUSAND OAKS: SANTA BARBARA 
MAN ASKS THAT CONEJO VALLEY GALLERY FIND A LARGER FACILITY. THAT MAY BE COSTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Barbara art collector has promised to donate $5.5-million worth of 
paintings, sculptures and carvings to the Conejo Valley Art Museum -- but only 
if the museum can move to a new location, which could cost millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Now located in a cramped storefront in the Janss Mall, the Conejo Valley Art 
Museum operates as a gallery, displaying new exhibits every few months. From 
delicate Ukrainian painted eggs to contemporary paintings of the Grand Canyon, 
the museum sponsors both foreign and local artists, but has no collection of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 To help the museum establish permanent displays, donor Charles Craig has 
offered an eclectic assortment from his renowned personal collection. His gift 
includes contemporary abstract works -- huge painted canvases and glass 
sculptures -- as well as African carvings dating to 500 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection includes modern works by Stanley Boxer, an abstract artist who 
became known as a sculptor of paint; David Burliuk, founder of Russia's 
futurist art movement; Norman Bluhm, an abstract Expressionist; Suzanne 
Duchamp, another abstract artist; and Max Weber, a Cubist painter. Some of the 
canvases are just slightly bigger than a notebook, while others are 70 feet 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig's donation also includes ancient wooden, stone and clay sculptures from 
Asia, Africa, South America and the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 The collector's South American holdings came under scrutiny by the U.S. 
customs office a few years ago. Federal officials raided Craig's home in 1989 
and seized some Peruvian artifacts deemed Peruvian national treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 The customs officials also targeted six other Southern California dealers and 
collectors and sent 123 of the most valuable artifacts back to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the museum board, Maria E. Dessornes, said she believes the 
artworks confiscated from Craig were later returned to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum displayed some of Craig's collection of drawings and watercolors in 
an exhibit last year, which received positive reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a well-known collection, with some very important pieces," said Paul 
Perrot, director of the Santa Barbara Art Museum, which has received several 
small donations from Craig in the past. Perrot could not speculate why Craig 
chose to give so many works to a Thousand Oaks museum, saying only, "It's an 
exciting moment for them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Craig's pledge comes with significant strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Conejo Valley Art Museum can receive the donation, Dessornes and 
other board members must find a new facility big enough to house the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Estimating the space requirements at 25,000 square feet, Dessornes has 
requested help from the Thousand Oaks City Council. Ideally, she said, a new 
Conejo Valley Art Museum could become a centerpiece of the Civic Arts Plaza, 
the $64-million performing arts and government center under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have the performing arts there, so to round it out, we need the 
visual arts," Dessornes said. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, city officials agree. They would love to see a museum at the Civic 
Arts Plaza site, particularly on the eight acres set aside for private 
development next to the massive public building under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in practice, they doubt they can help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't see where the finances might come from," Councilman Alex Fiore 
said. "My initial reaction is, they're really asking a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Due to open in September, the Civic Arts Plaza has no room for a large museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 10,000 square feet of office space in the building remain empty, city 
officials are counting on raising money by leasing that area to a private 
group. Originally, they expected the Conejo Recreation and Park District to pay 
$2 million over several decades to rent the office space. But the park district 
pulled out because of budget constraints, and officials are scrambling to find 
a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 With an annual budget of just $50,000 a year, the museum cannot afford to pay 
rent, Dessornes said. For the past three years, the museum has occupied its 
5,000-square-foot storefront for free, courtesy of the Janss Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 And even with that break, the museum owes the city $10,000 in unpaid utility 
bills, Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessornes said the museum's trustees would be prepared to raise money for a 
new building. 
</P>
<P>
 But arts experts estimated that a 25,000-square-foot facility would cost close 
to $10 million to build. And raising money may be tough, especially because the 
Thousand Oaks arts community is focused on finding donors to contribute to the 
Civic Arts Plaza endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a major job to raise that kind of money," said Andrew Voth, 
director of the Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard. "A museum is the hardest 
building in the world to build, because you need special air conditioning, 
special storage, special lighting and it has to be extra secure." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The key to fund-raising, said Perrot of the Santa Barbara Museum, would be to 
make sure "the collection is good and the community is fired up." Also, he 
said, the fund-raisers must have patience "and a few angels willing to make 
leadership gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Conejo Valley museum manages to build a new facility for Craig's 
donation, it could end up with the most valuable art collection in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carnegie museum, which draws about 10,000 visitors a year, values its 
collection of California art at roughly $1 million. The Ventura County Museum 
of History and Art has a small collection of paintings, but devotes most of its 
space to historical exhibits.

 David McCune likes running a Newbury Park publishing company, as he previously 
enjoyed being a journalist and computer programmer. But he still doesn't know 
what he wants to do when he grows up, he told a class of Thousand Oaks students 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain, the president of Sage Publications told the group. 
Without an education, he would not have had so much choice among occupations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nobody all day long who tells me what to do," McCune told the 
eighth-grade students at Los Cerritos Intermediate School. "That freedom comes 
from one simple thing: an education. Without it, you'll be stuck." 
</P>
<P>
 McCune and 19 other business leaders from the Conejo Valley and Ventura County 
urged students to stay in school as part of the Youth Employment Motivation 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce, the program shows students 
role models in blue-collar and professional jobs who point out that any type of 
work requires at least a high school education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the thing I'm most grateful for, my education," McCune said. 
</P>
<P>
 The message is simple, but it has impact because it comes from people who 
speak from experience in all walks of life, Los Cerritos Principal Jo-Ann Yoos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way for students to hear people other than teachers or their parents 
put a value on their education," Yoos said. "It sometimes holds more 
credibility for students if they hear it right from the source. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they can hear it enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Joel, 12, said he was impressed by the message of David Johnson, a 
research assistant at Amgen Inc. Ian said he wants to be a doctor, so he's 
starting to prepare now with honors courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the better the education you get, the more fun you have in your job, 
because the better you do in your job, the more fun it is," Ian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he participated in the volunteer program because he believes it 
is important for adults to motivate children to work hard using positive 
messages rather than scare tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to start reaching kids sooner and letting them know we have 
to be committed to something in our lives," Johnson said after his speech. 
"They need to know: Nobody is going to give you anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if students do not know what they want to do, it's important for them to 
realize that almost anything they eventually choose will require an education, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids want to hang out with friends, but sometimes they have to say, 'Hey, 
tonight I'm going to hit the books. I'll meet up with you tomorrow,' " Johnson 
said. "They need to be dedicated." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks program, part of a national organization, has sent speakers 
into middle school classrooms annually for seven years, said Linda Van Zandt, a 
GTE market analyst who recruited this year's volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 speakers agreed to visit classrooms at all four Thousand Oaks 
middle schools this week, Van Zandt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Elliott, a staff coordinator at Amgen, said she volunteered for the 
program because she sees how valuable it could be to get students thinking 
about their futures before the end of high school forces decisions on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in the eighth grade, all I knew was next year I'd get to be in 
high school," Elliott said.

A HOPEFUL ROMANTIC; IN THE '90S, CAN LUTHER VANDROSS GET MORE MILEAGE OUT OF 
THIS LOVE THING? YOU BET! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM , Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If for some reason you feel you can't stomach hearing a love song tonight, our 
advice is to keep well clear of Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Luther Vandross is here, and the titles in his discography tell the whole 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vandross summed up his highly successful first decade of pop-R&B crooning 
with a 1989 best-of compilation, he titled it "The Best of Luther Vandross, The 
Best of Love" as if "Luther" and "Love" were interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
 That collection included songs called "The Glow of Love," "Stop to Love," 
"There's Nothing Better Than Love," "Any Love" and "Love Won't Let Me Wait." 
For 10 points, guess what the songs that didn't have "love" in the title were 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 In case anyone thought a new decade would raise a new subject for the suave 
Vandross, he dubbed his first album of the decade "Power of Love." 
</P>
<P>
 And now he's back with "Never Let Me Go," which, like all nine of his previous 
solo releases, has topped the million mark in sales. The offerings include 
"Love Me Again," "Love Is On the Way (Real Love)" and a cover of the Bee Gees' 
"How Deep Is Your Love." 
</P>
<P>
 How has a singer with just one thing on his mind kept such a big audience for 
so long? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, love is a fairly popular subject. And Vandross has a classy way of 
approaching it -- contrary to what we hear too often from a younger generation 
of arduous R&B singers. 
</P>
<P>
 If Vandross utters the word "hoe" from the stage, it will probably mean that 
he has decided to tell an anecdote about gardening. If he grabs his crotch, the 
reason no doubt will be a sudden and painful groin-muscle pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandross' following is built around women who want to hear his ultra-romantic 
take on love (and no doubt some canny fellows who know that music is the food 
of you-know-what). It's interesting to note how Vandross consistently puts the 
women in his songs in a position of power, and how the love he extols is 
consistently of the romantic, lasting variety, and not the one-night quickie 
shot of hormonal relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandross can be heard pleading and beseeching throughout the album, begging 
his lovers' consent to keep troubled romances going. It's not only their bodies 
he craves, but the chance to prove that he is a constant, respectful lover who 
knows that sex alone does not constitute "The Best of Love." 
</P>
<P>
 (In a business-sector parallel to the scenario of many of his songs, Vandross 
recently sued for divorce from his longtime record company, Epic, only to patch 
things up and return to the label. He received his own custom label, LV 
Records, as a let's-make-up gift.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's telling that when Vandross took a vocal-tandem turn with Frank Sinatra on 
"The Lady Is a Tramp," the leadoff track on Ol' Blue Eyes' recent "Duets" 
album, they changed the word "tramp" to "champ." Vandross does not like to sing 
ill of women. The late Conway Twitty took a similar approach in his long career 
as a country balladeer, and he never had a hard time mustering an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandross isn't afraid of sharing a concert bill with women who are strong 
performers and strong personalities. During the '80s, his touring partners 
included Patti LaBelle and Anita Baker. Now his opening act is Oleta Adams, who 
after just two albums has won wide acclaim for the depth of feeling in her 
delivery, and for her ability both as a singer and a pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a common calling as romantic singers, Vandross and Adams both 
got early career boosts from British rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandross, who grew up in New York City, hooked up with David Bowie in 1974, 
serving as vocal arranger and backing singer on Bowie's "Young Americans" album 
and subsequent tours. That kicked off a busy period as a backing singer for 
such stars as Bette Midler, Carly Simon and Chaka Khan. After fronting a group 
called Luther, Vandross launched his solo career in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, from Yakima, Wash., was performing in a hotel bar in Kansas City when 
the band Tears for Fears happened upon her. That led to a featured role on a 
subsequent Tears for Fears album and tour. Adams' 1990 debut album, "Circle of 
One," was a success, and touring with Michael Bolton helped establish her and 
showed that she was at home in big venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new release, "Evolution," is another tasty mix of pop and R&B.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: RIGHTEOUS BROTHERS; "ANTHOLOGY: 1962-1974" (1989); RHINO

 Since the Santa Ana-bred Righteous Brothers still pop up regularly at Bill 
Medley's nightclub in Fountain Valley, there's a tendency around here to 
discount their contributions to pop music. This excellent two-disc anthology 
makes that impossible.Deep-voiced Medley and his longtime partner with the 
soaring tenor, Bobby Hatfield, simply made some of the best pop records ever. 
Such Phil Spector-produced masterpieces as "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' " 
and "Unchained Melody" are here, of course. But lest you think Spector made 
this act, check out the pair's earlier recordings for the Moonglow label, 
produced by Medley and written by him or Hatfield. While not the towering 
examples of studio artistry that their Spector records would be, "Little Latin 
Lupe Lu," "My Babe" and "Try to Find Another Man" captured even more exuberant 
performances, perfectly showcasing their answer to the black R&B they grew up 
with, a style that led to the coining of the phrase "blue-eyed soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Material that followed their second, and last, No. 1 record, "(You're My) Soul 
and Inspiration," is highlighted by the 1966 gospel-flavored Top 20 hit "He" 
and Medley's post-breakup solo single from 1968, "Brown-Eyed Woman." Of course, 
their 1974 reunion hit "Rock and Roll Heaven," a sappy salute to dead rock 
stars, is included for historical purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who thinks Michael Bolton knows what soul singing is all about, 
give this a listen and be prepared to hold on to your socks. RANDY LEWIS

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: SWEETHEARTS OF THE RODEO; "RODEO WALTZ"; SUGAR HILL  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM; RANDY LEWIS, , SCHWARZ,; MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In commercial terms, the Sweethearts of the Rodeo could be seen as heading in 
the wrong direction. After establishing a track record on the country charts, 
the harmonizing sister duo of Kristine Arnold and Janis Gill has signed to the 
small, independent, folk/bluegrass label, Sugar Hill, at a time when mainstream 
country is booming. 
</P>
<P>
 The move pays off artistically, though, as the sisters exercise the freedom a 
small label grants to choose varied material from out-of-the-mainstream 
sources, and to render it with tradition-steeped directness and simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 But small label doesn't mean small potatoes in terms of hired help. The 
featured instrumentalist is Stuart Duncan, one of Nashville's top fiddlers. 
Duncan's forte is sweetness and lyricism, which makes him a perfect foil for 
the sisters' lovely close harmonies. Gill's husband, Vince, is now the big 
mainstream country star in the family, but here he is just the gittar-player, 
snapping out some excellent solos that recall the days when he was known for 
his bluegrass-inspired picking more than for his crooning. Sam Bush, one of the 
flashiest mandolin players around, shows he can handle a more circumscribed 
supporting role with taste and aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The material moves from old-line honky-tonk and country classics (a good, 
springy treatment of Johnny Cash's rockin' "Get Rhythm") to contributions from 
contemporary country songwriter Don Schlitz.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sweethearts also rope in some good ones from the rock and folk field. They 
cover Jesse Winchester's memorable convict-on-the-lam lament, "Brand New 
Tennessee Waltz," and the Gordon Lightfoot homecoming song "Steel Rail Blues" 
before closing the otherwise earthy record with an urgent reading of Robbie 
Robertson's epic-scale ballad of spiritual romance, "Broken Arrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally they go in for the utter schmaltz that clutters mainstream 
Nashville output: "Jenny Dreamed of Trains," by Vince Gill and the usually more 
hard-headed Guy Clark, is a treacly supernatural fantasy, while Schlitz's 
"Things Will Grow" trades in routine country sentiment about the sweetness and 
continuity of family life. Tolstoy wrote that all happy families are alike and 
therefore not the most fruitful ground for artistic endeavor; God knows country 
music is larded with too many sound-alike songs about the verities of home and 
hearth. The thing is, the Sweethearts handle the schmaltzy stuff so winsomely 
that you find yourself giving in to the sentimentality against your will.

COMEDY: HENRY CHO WANTS Y'ALL TO LAUGH AT HIS STORYTELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL , Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much has been made about Henry Cho's unique niche in comedy: He's the only 
full-blooded Korean working the circuit who was born in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also very funny, and that's what he prefers to dwell on. Which is why 
the first thing he does is address his audiences' slack-jawed stares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Howdy. How y'all doin'?" Cho typically asks a crowd in his opening remarks. 
"I know what may be going through your mind right now. Just let it soak in a 
second or two, because there's something wrong with this picture, ain't there?" 
</P>
<P>
 That said, the first-timers in the crowd realize they aren't the brunt of some 
practical joke; they relax, and the cowboy-booted Cho, who performs at the Brea 
Improv through Sunday, drawls his way through the rest of the set. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho's humor comes more from storytelling than a Gatling gun of jokes. He works 
friends, family, sports, college days and anything else for laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes a jab, for instance, at his father's ongoing struggle with the 
English language, including the time he asked a waitress for a quickie. "That's 
quiche, Dad, quiche." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Irvine Improv, Chris Rock, now a regular on Fox's "In Living Color," is 
performing Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock got his break in 1987, when his childhood idol Eddie Murphy caught his 
act at New York's Comedy Strip and asked him to perform on Murphy's HBO special 
"Uptown Comedy Express." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Bedford-Stuyvesant product has moved into movies, including 
"Boomerang," "New Jack City" and the gangsta rap spoof "CB4," in which he 
starred. On the TV side, he's probably best remembered as Nat X, the black 
militant talk-show host on "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Rock is not for the timid or those who like their comedy without an edge. He 
talks about pimps, abortion, race . . . subjects not readily linked to humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March in San Juan Capistrano, the comic told the crowd: "It's not Roe vs. 
Wade, it's broke vs. paid. . . . Are we going to have Timmy, or get cable?" 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the mild stuff. 
</P>

 "I like talking about things the other guys aren't talking about," Rock told 
The Times last year. "Anybody can talk about something that's already really 
funny and get a laugh out of that. But to take something totally unfunny -- 
something people feel uncomfortable about -- and get a laugh out of that, then 
you're doing something. 
</P>
<P>
 Also doing something at the Irvine Improv is Todd Glass, who takes a 
freewheeling, almost maniacal approach to comedy.  
</P>
<P>
 Glass uses his whole body to get his jokes across, including an imitation of 
his father's smoking that is fast becoming his signature piece. He headlines 
the bill tonight and Friday, then performs as the middle act for Rock on 
Saturday and Sunday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he headlines again before being 
the middle act for Dennis Wolfberg from Jan. 20 through 23. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, Terry Mulroy, the high-energy, fast-talking comic, does a 
one-evening gig Tuesday at the Centerfield Sports Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably best known for imitating aging rock heroes, Mulroy has also 
entertained crowds on A&E's "Evening at the Improv" as well as at comedy clubs 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, Jerry Dye plays through Sunday at Standing Room Only.

WANNA DANCE?; AT NEW NIGHTCLUB, IT TAKES TWO TO MANGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 With music, cuisine and entertainment inspired by a melange of Latin American, 
Creole and Afro-Cuban cultures, Newport Beach's newest nightclub, Mango, seems 
plucked right out of Miami's trendy South Beach. Its owners, Massimo Navarretta 
and Lucy Luhan, are betting they can turn up the heat in these parts, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Mango offers a place where fans of cumbia, mambo, salsa, calypso and even New 
Orleans jazz can savor these rhythms Tuesday through Sunday and find a 
designated space to dance. Unfortunately, that space is rather small, and the 
week-old club could outgrow it quickly. But bumping into and rubbing against 
other dancers is typical at a good salsa club (and we're not necessarily 
referring to lambada), so let the crowding begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Various live ensembles take to the stage in the main room Thursday through 
Sunday, performing steel drum-laced island favorites, mellow reggae and vintage 
jazz. Jamallad, a five-piece band, will set the groove Sunday afternoons, from 
1 to 5 p.m., with reggae and Brazilian sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Latin experience, expect big bands with a hearty sound every 
Tuesday in the dance room. The 11-piece Macondo Orchestra debuts at the club 
Jan. 18 and will be featured every week thereafter as the house orchestra, 
except when there are special touring acts. 
</P>
<P>
 A dance instructor will eventually join the entertainment Tuesday nights, 
teaching the feverish dances that accompany this brand of music. When the bands 
aren't on, a deejay will keep the beat going with tunes from the likes of Tito 
Puente and Celia Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa in the dance room gets put on ice Thursday through Saturday, in favor of 
disco, funk and house. Although the music is fun, there's something tired about 
the scene. Perhaps it's the mostly middle-aged crowd grooving to the odd 
combination of oldies and tunes their kids listen to. 
</P>
<P>
 The go-go dancers in their gauche, French-cut, ripped jeans and sequin-trimmed 
mesh tops don't help the scene any. To them this simple message: Rhythm is a 
dancer, and thy name is certainly not Rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they're a carry-over of BBGs, the nightclub that formerly occupied 
this space along Coast Highway. That club was also owned by Luhan. Her decision 
to team up with Navarretta and transform the space into Mango was borne out of 
a desire to work together again; the pair co-owned several businesses in the 
mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarretta, a Naples-born restaurateur who also owns Scampi's in Newport Beach 
and Amici Trattoria Italiana in Costa Mesa, put together the Caribbean-flavored 
menu in a way that caters to the current low-fat craze; fruit juices are 
substituted for oil whenever possible. A sampling of the menu is available in 
an all-you-can-eat buffet, Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday, for $15. 
</P>
<P>
 The tropical theme continues at the bar with such sweet cocktail names as 
Mango Tango and Sugar Reef and the always-popular Cuba Libre with a twist 
($3.75 to $5). Wells here are $2.75 to $3.75; glasses of wine run about $4; 
domestic beer, $2 to $3, and imports $2.50 to $3.75.

SURFING: ROGUE WAVES WASH OUT ROAD TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach surfer/shop owner. Times 
staff writer David Reyes has reported on surf teams. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not all surfing safaris are filled with sunshine, glass and perfect breaks. 
Some can get a little hairy. A lot hairy, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hodges, a 30-year-old Laguna Beach surfer and Infinity surf shop owner, 
was with two other surfers last month off Todos Santos Island in Mexico when a 
25-foot wave thundered toward them and their 14-foot inflatable boat anchored 
in the impact zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The wave, a mean, gnarly low-tide devil that Hodges described as a rogue, 
flipped the boat and ripped away its anchor line. Hodges' friend, Barry 
Deffenbaugh of Huntington Beach, younger brother of pro surfer Jeff 
Deffenbaugh, was aboard filming with a video camera when the wave broke 30 to 
35 yards in front of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry just ditched the camera and hung on to the boat's cross bar and stayed 
with the boat as it went over," Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges, a friend of Rockin' Fig's, told us about that day, the wave, and 
subsequent incidents that kept them overnight on Todos Santos, about five miles 
off Ensenada. For Fig and me, it gave new meaning to the Mexican greeting, 
Bienvenidos.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig: Did you think you were gonna drown?  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Hodges said, "but you do think about survival when this 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 As a big-wave rider, Hodges has surfed Todos for seven years. It was 
Deffenbaugh's first time there, though their companion, Terry Senate, a 
38-year-old surfboard shaper, had ridden it before. 
</P>
<P>
 They had trailered the boat and its 40-horsepower outboard from Orange County 
to Ensenada. They knew Todos would be going off. But it was small . . . at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the backs of the waves, it went from five to 12 feet in less than four 
hours," Hodges said. "That would be 25-foot faces. The wave that flipped the 
boat was a good 25-footer." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as surfing, Hodges had to stay ahead of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I started with a 7-7 board and in 45 minutes, grabbed my 8-6 and in another 
two hours, grabbed my 9-0. I was pulling boards out of my boat like golf 
clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 As the surf grew, they were forced to move the boat out farther, anchoring it 
in the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to be sunset, and we wanted to take the last sets. Barry was in the 
boat with a video, and Terry took a wave in and was in the channel. I started 
paddling outside when I saw it, a rogue wave at low tide. It was a close-out 
all the way through the channel." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges got dredged while three successive huge waves pounded him and pushed 
him more than 100 yards shoreward. "Mostly, underwater," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They righted the boat. Deffenbaugh got into his wet suit, and they scrambled 
into the water searching for packs, surfboards, food and clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 They maneuvered the boat to the other side of the island, facing Ensenada. It 
was small relief. The worst was yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so big that day," Hodges said, "the leeward side was breaking with 
10-foot faces. I've never seen it so big. Another wave flipped (the boat) over 
again, and that's when we lost everything, except for our surfboards."  
</P>
<P>
 Stranded, they climbed ashore, knocked on the door of the island's lighthouse 
and asked for help.  
</P>
<P>
 "The lighthouse guy let us borrow some blankets. We spent the night, shivering 
. . . our surfboards beside us," Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
 They eventually got off the island by radioing a private fishing charter in 
the Port of Ensenada.  
</P>
<P>
 Will you go back?  
</P>
<P>
 "I just ordered a new engine on my credit card, and my boat will be repaired 
in two weeks. In another few months I'll be back out there. It was about $5,000 
for everything. Say, Fig, you wanna join us for our break-in trip?" 
</P>
<P>
 Let me pay up my life insurance first.  
</P>
<P>
 Forecast: Head-high waves expected Friday and Saturday at west and 
northwesterly breaks, predicts Surfline/Wavetrak. San Diego and Baja could be 
good.

DO IT: GETTING RUNNERS OFF THE STREET 
</P>

<P>
 Barry Hawley ("Baz" to his friends) is waging a sometimes lonely campaign to 
get runners off the pavement and onto the trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1984, the gregarious English expatriate has organized the San Juan Trail 
50, a 50-mile run held each fall along trails in the backcountry of Cleveland 
National Forest. A favorite event among that hardy breed known as 
ultra-distance runners, the race is nonetheless well beyond the limits of most 
weekend warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 So last year, Hawley launched a four-race series of shorter off-road runs 
starting from Blue Jay Campground off Ortega Highway. The winter series has 
been expanded to six runs for 1994, starting Saturday with a 12-kilometer jaunt 
and building up to a 50K run March 26. The races will be held every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 With a shoestring budget, Hawley is depending on word-of-mouth to build the 
series. Last year's races ranged from 40 to 90 runners. Some of the more 
popular street runs can draw thousands of participants, but Hawley sees hope 
for his crusade to get runners to try the trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Many runners over 30 years old "are really sick and tired of the 10Ks and that 
sort of thing," Hawley said. When they try trail running, he added, the 
injuries have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running slower and on softer terrain is definitely easier on the legs and 
joints." 
</P>
<P>
 Trail running has the advantage of some spectacular scenery as well. From the 
trails around Blue Jay, at about 3,000 feet, there are vistas that stretch such 
peaks as San Jacinto, above Palm Springs, and San Gorgonio, the highest peak in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they have tried the trails, I have never had anybody say, 'Hey Baz, that 
was terrible,' " Hawley said. He is counting on lots of repeat runners for the 
coming series, plus an infusion of newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's course starts off with a half mile on paved road to separate the 
runners before they hit the trail loop. The course includes some moderate 
elevation gain and loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The race begins at 8 a.m. Runners can register before the race, but there's a 
$5 penalty atop the $12 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming events are a 16K on Jan. 29, entry fee $12; a 22K on Feb. 12 for $18; 
another 12K on Feb. 26 for $12; a four-by-12K team relay March 12 at $60 per 
team, and the 50K race March 26, with an entry fee of $40. Series T-shirts are 
$9. 
</P>
<P>
 The relay is something Hawley tried out at a recent race he organized at Lake 
Isabella.  
</P>
<P>
 "It worked out really fantastic," he said. "What I'm hoping for basically is 
for groups to get involved in trail running." 
</P>
<P>
 What: 12K trail run. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, Jan. 15, at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Blue Jay Campground, Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the San Diego (5) Freeway, exit at Ortega Highway and drive 
north into the hills, past Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park and past Upper San 
Juan Campground. Turn left at Main Divide Road and follow the signs to Blue Jay 
Campground. 
</P>

CAST OF HUNDREDS; MYART'S PRODUCTION OF 'OLIVER!' REFLECTS PHILOSOPHY OF THE 
MORE, THE MERRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Dana Hanstein is into team spirit in a big way. And sister, we do mean big. 
</P>
<P>
 Since founding her Musical Youth Artists Repertory Theatre (MYART) in 1989, 
Hanstein has preached her message of cooperation over competition to more than 
1,000 children and young adults in Orange and Los Angeles counties. Her 
philosophy: Every MYART participant, no matter what their age or abilities, has 
something to contribute and deserves a spot in the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, when selecting the three plays her group presents each 
season, Hanstein leans toward Broadway musicals or revues with large, make that 
large , casts. A typical MYART show will include anywhere from 100 to 250 
actors, ranging from kindergartners to college-age students. From Jan. 14 
through 23, MYART presents "Oliver!" at Millikan High School auditorium in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 One way Hanstein gets all her students into a production is through the common 
practice of double casting, having children share principal roles during a 
production. This also lessens the physical and emotional demands of working in 
back-to-back performances. Plus, because each additional young face on stage 
brings with it at least one or two proud, ticket-buying relations, it doesn't 
hurt at the box office, either. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you're directing enough actors to populate a small neighborhood, 
double casting just isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Oliver!" for example, Hanstein has selected five youngsters to alternate 
in the title role and an equal number to play the Artful Dodger. As for the 
workhouse kids . . . well, let's just say Mr. Bumble should be buying their 
gruel on the bulk foods aisle at Price Club. At last count, there were more 
than 100, and the whole lot of them perform together in the show's finale. 
</P>
<P>
 What the youngsters lack in square footage on stage, they make up for with a 
sense of accomplishment and camaraderie that Hanstein says is unique to their 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, you can have just as much of a success on stage in 
an ensemble as in a lead part," she explained during a break at "Oliver!" 
rehearsals in Long Beach. "I'm sure there are kids who feel they're just a part 
of a crowd, but I always let them know that I'm watching them as individuals. 
If they work at it, they can shine no matter what part they play." 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the MYART players in "Oliver!" are about a dozen adult actors 
experienced in community or college theater. The adults not only add a level of 
professionalism to the show, said Hanstein, they also serve as role models for 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're not good with kids, they better not do my show," she said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 The constantly changing cast list is no problem for her students because they 
are well schooled in working together as an ensemble. Each MYART show is 
prefaced by three to five months of weekly classes in acting, singing, dancing 
and backstage work taught by six instructors, including Hanstein.  
</P>
<P>
 Students pay about $150 for each session, plus the cost of their costumes for 
the show. Parents, typically 30 to 50 for each show, volunteer behind the 
scenes and also serve on planning committees.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the majority of her students in the Southern California program are 
from Orange County, Hanstein has rehearsed and performed primarily in Long 
Beach because she has been unable to find an affordable space here. Last week, 
however, she struck a deal with the Westminster School District to use Helen 
Stacey Intermediate School in Huntington Beach until March to prepare for their 
next production, "Sound of Music," which will be performed either at Millikan 
or Cal State Long Beach.

REWIND: A CLIMBER'S PEEK AT VIEWS FROM THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that "Cliffhanger" has hit the video stores, it's high time for a look at 
that and other cinematic "peak experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester Stallone's movie may have realized gross receipts of $80 million, 
but climbers focused on its gross implausibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly exciting opening scenes, for instance, find a young lovely, a 
first-time climber, following "her man," surrounded by snowcapped peaks, up a 
spire that would give a more experienced climber pause in any season. As might 
never happen, the buckle of her harness all but melts during rescue efforts. 
The story, based on a premise by climbing guru John Long, is set in Colorado 
but was filmed in Italy's Dolomites. The dialogue wouldn't see the pages of a 
self-respecting comic book, but the views are worth the price of a rental. 
</P>
<P>
 From this climber's point of view, however, there are any number of better 
choices: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Eiger Sanction" (1975), with Clint Eastwood starring and directing, still 
offers some of Hollywood's most convincing climbing footage, both in its early 
training sequences and later on the legendary north face of the Eiger in the 
Swiss Alps. 
</P>
<P>
 Presaging Indiana Jones, Eastwood opens the film as an art professor under the 
lustful gaze of female students. Dialogue in general, and Jack Cassidy's 
characterization as a way-over-the-top stereotypical gay in particular, 
continue to smack of political incorrectness from a '90s vantage, and the 
rambling film could stand some editing, but Eastwood fans and climbers alike 
are sure to love it nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "K2: The Ultimate High" (1992) proved more successful as a play with dialogue 
focusing on character development and the relationship of two climbing partners 
in the face of potentially fatal crises. The Pakistani mountain setting -- 
presumably K2, the second tallest peak on Earth, but actually Mt. Waddington in 
British Columbia -- and relatively thrilling climbing sequences save the film 
version; Michael Biehn plays a self-centered lawyer, while Matt Craven wrestles 
between mountain yearnings and responsibility to wife and new son. 
</P>
<P>
 Released as part of a National Geographic "Great Explorers" box set this year, 
"Return to Everest" documents the 30-year anniversary of the historic climb of 
Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary traverses, says the narrator, "not only the great landforms of 
Earth, but a less visible geography, the private landscapes of (Hillary's) 
passage through the years," including the death of his wife and daughter in a 
plane crash, his son Peter's near-fatal accident in the Himalayas, and a 
reunion with Norgay. Footage of the 1953 expedition is dramatic. The film 
ultimately focuses on Hillary's formation of a Himalayan Trust to support the 
building and staffing of 22 schools across Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mountain" (1956) is long on heart, short on realism and mostly just plain 
hokey, but Spencer Tracy is always great to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Here Tracy's a retired, respected climber, now a poor shepherd, with an 
incredibly greedy younger brother (played by Robert Wagner) who is not above 
taking the diamond from a dying Hindu's nose. The younger sibling persuades the 
scrupulous elder, against his better judgment, to again scale the Alpine peak 
overlooking their village so that the creep can plunder victims of a fatal air 
crash. Climbing sequences would embarrass most climbers, but E.G. Marshall and 
Claire Trevor in important roles add up to enjoyable viewing. 
</P>

SPECIAL SCREENING: MORALITY PLAYS THE LEAD ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 One of the most affecting images in Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon" is of the 
characters hurtling through the forest, as if they're rushing to an unholy 
shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 They always end up in the same spot, a dense glade where a rape and murder 
take place. It's the central event of the 1950 movie, which screens Friday as 
the first installment in UC Irvine's "Tragedy and Comedy" series, and Kurosawa 
keeps bringing them and us back to it. 
</P>
<P>
 We soon learn that the crimes may be dramatic, but they aren't as profound as 
everybody's interpretation of them. Kurosawa isn't nearly as interested in the 
acts as he is in what they say about man's weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 By using flashbacks to retell the rape and murder in differing ways, the 
Japanese director explores the reach of man's frailty in finding personal 
morality. 
</P>
<P>
 He said as much in "Something of an Autobiography," his 1982 reflection on his 
extraordinary career. Kurosawa wrote that he wanted to probe "the depths of the 
human heart as if with a surgeon's scalpel, laying bare its dark complexities 
and bizarre twists." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, his cuts went deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Rashomon" wasn't hailed by Japanese critics, it became important in 
other countries, including here. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is credited with opening an international door to the expanding 
Japanese cinema and, particularly, for creating art-house fervor for Kurosawa 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture begins with three strangers (played by Takashi Shimura, Kichijiro 
Veda and Minoru Chiaki) finding shelter in the ruins of the Rashomon Gate at 
the entrance of Kyoto in the 11th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rain comes down, they discuss the killing of a samurai lord (Masayuki 
Mori) and the attack on his wife (Machiko Kyo) by a bandit (Toshiro Mifune). 
</P>
<P>
 The talk is animated and disturbed because they find the crime so difficult to 
fathom; the barbarity of it shocks two of the men while the third attributes it 
to the world's harshness. From there, Kurosawa takes us back to the first of 
the interpretations, using the bandit's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in custody, he confesses, giving the basic facts. He noticed the nobleman 
and his wife, then decided to rape her, even if it meant murdering the man. He 
recounts the events with passion, giving them a heroic shading as he describes 
the battle between the two men that preceded the killing. Further, it was the 
woman, he said, who insisted they fight to the death. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the woman tells her side. Next, the dead lord gets to tell his (Kurosawa 
tosses in a medium who channels his spirit for these bold sequences). Then one 
of the strangers, who claims to have witnessed the crime, tells his version. 
</P>
<P>
 All the perspectives are self-serving, or at least shaded by personal biases. 
Kurosawa is offering a dark sermon -- life is violent and tragic, and we're not 
even strong enough to deal with it honestly. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's sentimental coda, where two of the strangers have a gentle 
epiphany over an abandoned baby, doesn't do much to diminish Kurosawa's 
pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps "Rashomon" from becoming didactic are Kurosawa's vibrant visuals, 
which show his trademark grace with action sequences that somehow carry both 
verve and naturalism in each frame. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is not only about thought, but movement, as each story is played out 
with small variations. 
</P>

<P>
 Still, those attending the benefit will find a notable cast of chefs preparing 
the meal: Paul Squicciarini of Sorrento Grille; Ignazio Vincenzo and Antonio 
Romeo of Romeo Cucina; Rick Sedler of Partner's Bistro; Todd Clore of Claes' 
Seafood at the Hotel Laguna, and Bruce Klier of Cedar Creek Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception begins at 4:30 p.m., with seating for dinner at 6. Tickets are 
$150 per person, and all proceeds will be donated toward the creation of a 
counseling center.  
</P>
<P>

A SIMPLY DELICIOUS MENU AT PUCK CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Wolfgang Puck just might be America's most famous chef and food personality at 
the moment. His cherubic face has been seen on "Good Morning America" and 
countless other TV shows, on frozen pizza boxes and in photographs with movie 
stars -- everywhere but on those posters in the post office. 
</P>
<P>
 When super-agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar died recently, much attention was 
focused on Spago, Puck's flagship West Hollywood restaurant, because Lazar 
always held his legendary post-Oscar bashes there. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand's concert at the MGM Grand in Vegas brought Puck even more 
publicity, because directly across the lobby from the showroom, a new Wolfgang 
Puck Cafe is serving upward of 1,500 people a day. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is relevant to us, because Puck has recently taken that particular 
act to South Coast Plaza, where one of these dizzyingly colorful cafes just 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
 You might wonder how this easygoing Austrian guy became a cultural icon. Let's 
say it's a combination of timing, skill and savvy. Puck is a classically 
trained chef who worked mostly in France before being "discovered" here, but 
he's also a creator with a gift for knowing exactly what we like. 
</P>
<P>
 He's an excellent trainer and motivator, too. In the short space of 10 years, 
Puck has turned out dozens of hot chefs, arguably more than anyone else in the 
food world. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu at Wolfgang Puck Cafe, largely salads, pizzas and pastas, includes 
dishes from his big-time restaurants. The trick is that almost every item is 
simple and popular -- Puck's greatest hits, if you will -- but at prices far 
below what you'd pay at Spago, Chinois on Main or Granita. (The catch: Don't 
count on running into Julia Roberts or Steven Spielberg.) 
</P>
<P>
 I've been eating here for nearly two months now, and I have yet to discover a 
single bad dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lazaroff, Puck's wife and partner, designed the cafe's look, which 
could be described as Op Art with an attitude (or alternatively, as a friend in 
Newport Beach puts it, as a rich housewife's mall fantasy). 
</P>
<P>
 Both the walls and floor are done in colorful broken tiles, like flotsam 
collected by an intergalactic beachcomber. Conde Nast-type illustrations hang 
proudly over many of the scrunched-up booths, each one emblazoned with the Puck 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll enter passing the open kitchen, where good breads and pizzas will be 
baking in an oven fired by wooden logs. The impatient can grab a seat at the 
cafe's three-seat counter, a frenetic spot always crowded with cooks, servers 
and bus persons. It's quieter out on the cafe patio, under parasols that look 
remarkably similar to the covers on Puck's frozen pizza boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The best tables, though, are at the rear of the cafe, near the entrance to 
Bullock's. From there, you can watch everything: the shoppers, the kitchen and 
a good deal of frantic eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Come at lunch and nearly everyone will be digging into Chinois chicken salad 
-- finely shredded, piled high and doused with a subtly spicy soy, sesame oil, 
honey and mustard dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big favorite is the chopped vegetable salad, a small mountain of 
carrot, celery, white corn, green beans, onions and tomatoes, so pretty to look 
at that you'll feel guilty eating it. I'm clearly in the minority, but I prefer 
the spicy Asian shrimp salad to either. It gets its kicks from julienned 
shiitake mushroom and carrot, plenty of crushed peanuts and wonderfully tender 
sauteed shrimps.  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to resist the pizzas, since you smell them baking every minute you 
are in this cafe. I'm a sucker for the pepperoni, because the thick-sliced 
pepperoni sausage the cafe uses is about the most flavorful I've had. 
</P>
<P>
 The vegetarian calzone is a gastronomic Christmas stocking stuffed with 
spinach, wild mushrooms, roasted garlic, thyme, sweet peppers and whole-milk 
mozzarella that comes drooling out of its pizza envelope right on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoked salmon pizza, invented at Spago as kind of an ethnic joke, is 
really delightful. The pizza's cracker-thin crust is smeared with a thin layer 
of red onion slices and a fresh dill cream, then blanketed with smoked salmon. 
(Get it? It's lox and bagels with a pizza instead of a bagel.) 
</P>
<P>
 The pasta orders are big enough to split. I'm told the most popular is 
Barbara's (for Puck's wife) fettuccine, made with Louisiana shrimp, fresh 
vegetables and a tomato curry sauce, but there are two others I'd order first. 
One is Grandma Puck's linguine with chicken Bolognese (hardly what you'd expect 
from southern Austria). This is a rich pasta with a ragu of minced chicken 
finished with cream, and you probably won't finish it. The other is wild 
mushroom tortellini, big ones swimming in butter, garlic, Parmesan and fresh 
herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe's only main course dish, properly speaking, is roast chicken, cooked 
either of two ways: plain (with rosemary) or with an unctuous red barbecue 
sauce. Go for the plain, the better to enjoy the terrific garlic mashed 
potatoes. Oh, sure, you could have your chicken with a small Caesar or with 
french fries, but don't be a fool. Creamy, runny and smooth all at once, the 
garlic mashed potatoes are surely the cafe's masterpiece.  
</P>
<P>
 And don't miss the simple, sumptuous desserts. There are well-crafted cliches 
like New York cheesecake, tiramisu and a caramelized apple pie, but you'll do 
better with chocolate souffle cake or (my choice) Viennese ice coffee. The 
chocolate souffle cake is a comforting fudgy lump, served warm with a topping 
of vanilla bean ice cream. The Viennese ice coffee uses the same vanilla ice 
cream, but it's a real contrast: a cold frothy mix of thick whipped cream, ice 
cream and an intensely flavored dark roast coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a dessert I wish for again and again, even more than I wish for that "A" 
table up at Spago. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfgang Puck Cafe is moderately priced. Appetizers and salads are $4.50 to 
$7.50. pastas are $8.50 to $11.50. Pizzas are $7.50 to $14.50. Desserts are $4 
to $5.50.

PARKER'S PLACE: SHOOTING THE BREEZE IS JUST PART OF THE FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker , T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Few things in life are as difficult as taking up a new sport, especially one 
that is a lot harder than it looks, as most sports tend to be. 
</P>
<P>
 My reasons for taking up skeet -- the shooting game where clay targets are 
flung from two towers and shot from a variety of positions -- were 1) to have 
fun, 2) to improve my quite minor shooting skills, 3) because some of my 
friends do it, and 4) to defeat my baseless conviction that no one over 30 
should take up a new sport and expect anything but ignominy. 
</P>
<P>
 We congregated at the Orange County Shooting and Training Center in Irvine, 
signed up and headed out to the range. 
</P>
<P>
 Four shooters were finishing up a round. It was a cool and hazy January night, 
and the orange clay discs, or "pigeons," were zipping from the two towers, 
through the lighted infield, and, if not hit, out into the darkened foothills. 
The targets that were hit exploded in festive patterns and shapes, shards of 
orange dissolving into the night. They looked like little UFOs trying to get 
away, a formidable warning to any small aliens contemplating an Earth invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 We waited our turn. My companions were Fritz, Ron, Vern, Rich and Marty. Fritz 
qualified for the Olympic team some years ago but chose college instead; Ron 
shoots competitively now; Vern, Rich and Marty I have seen actually knocking 
down clay birds on a trap range ( off the range, in fact) from 60 yards away, 
which is some 30 yards farther than the longest distance from which competitive 
trap is even shot. On a good day, they can run off 200 trap birds without a 
miss. In short, they are good shooters. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not. 
</P>
<P>
 At trap, I managed a perfect 25 some months ago, and haven't broken over 22 
since, suggesting a certain Buster Douglas quality about my one great round. 
But skeet was a much tougher game and I had tried it only a handful of times, 
with consistently disgraceful results. My best score to date had been a 14 
(also out of 25), and I'd felt lucky to get that. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly, skeet is a game where the birds come out of two towers -- sometimes 
simultaneously -- and the shooters, arched in a semicircle between the towers, 
try to hit them. The birds fly a predictable trajectory and a consistent speed 
and are not thrown until you call for them. The shooter uses a shotgun. What 
could be easier? 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasure and sense of accomplishment in making a good shot are the main 
reasons you shoot skeet in the first place. The third reason is that it's fun 
to blow things up. 
</P>
<P>
 There are all sorts of ingredients in making a good shot -- it involves the 
eyes and hands, the feet and arms, instinct, skill, experience, anticipation, 
lead and timing. Plus, a basic understanding of geometry. 
</P>
<P>
 To knock down a clay bird going 30 m.p.h. is a truly Euclidean experience, a 
real-life demonstration of all those laws you were taught in high school but 
couldn't apply to cheerleaders, drinking beer in orange groves, or bodysurfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that skeet is a strictly intellectual experience. One must not discount 
the fun of watching a small, elusive, rapid quarry explode into bright orange 
fragments at your command, or the satisfaction of being able to do it better 
than your friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot of sportsmen and sportswomen, accomplished shotgunners are generous 
in their advice to beginners and always want to bet money. The pot was a buck 
apiece. Halfway through the round, it was obvious I'd lost my dollar for 
certain, and was achieving a perfectly disastrous round of skeet. My 
companions, blowing pigeons out of the sky with aplomb, offered help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people tell you how far the lead is at this or that station," said Ron, 
"but that don't matter, because the angles are different. Forget lead. Swing 
through the bird and keep swinging after you shoot. That's the first rule. 
Watch." 
</P>
<P>
 The bird shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said Fritz. "The lead here is 2 1/2 feet. Hold a sustained lead of 2 1/2 
feet, and follow through smoothly. Watch." 
</P>
<P>
 The target turned to dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said Vern. "All the competitive shooters shoot through the bird. You 
kind of snap the gun through when you pull the trigger. Watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Smashed bird. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said Rich. "Fritz is the best shot I ever saw; he uses the sustained 
lead. Starting the swing before you call for the bird is what you do. Watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Target demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said Marty. "You've got to line the gun up over that post out there; 
that's where the bird will fly over. Hold your barrel up higher. Watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Poof. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got it," I said, nodding earnestly. I positioned myself as best I could, 
concentrating on the lost dollar, not leading, leading, sustained leading, 
swinging through, swinging early, the post, how hopeless the scorekeeper must 
think I am, how come God doesn't talk to anybody reliable anymore, how come 
Nina Vida's book about Little Saigon just got a fat movie option 
(congratulations, Nina!), but mine -- written five years ago -- didn't? 
</P>
<P>
 "Pull!" 
</P>
<P>
 The bird sailed, untouched, into the safe black of night. 
</P>
<P>
 End of round. Scores: 22, 23, 22, 22, 24, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty got the bucks, everybody got some yuks, and I got an eight. Feigning 
confidence, I went to the truck, put away the little side-by-side .20-gauge I'd 
been using, and pulled out a Remington .12-gauge that weighs as much as a Miata 
and can boom just about anything out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time for some appropriate ordnance," I announced to my skeptical competitors. 
We again took up our positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in firepower only confounded my inefficiency, as increases in 
firepower so often do. Trying to swing that monster within the tight arcs 
required on the skeet range was like trying to type with a bag of rocks tied to 
your wrists. I broke six birds, but one of them -- knocked down while two were 
in the air -- wasn't the one I was aiming at. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, I think I'll get some coffee," I muttered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," said Fritz, holding up a spent shotgun shell for my inspection. "See 
that little primer in there? See that 55-gallon drum over there? When you've 
reloaded enough shot shells that you've got a drum that big filled with used 
primers this small, you'll be a decent shot." 
</P>
<P>
 "Time to start reloading," I grumbled. "Oh hell, one more round?" 
</P>
<P>
 Laughter. Smiles. Wallets opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure!"

 IFS, ANDS, BUTTS: Santa Clarita officials are having second thoughts about 
leaping aboard the anti-smoking train. Although the City Council earlier was 
ready to ban smoking in restaurants, workplaces and enclosed public areas, it 
decided to hold two more public meetings on the issue and survey restaurant 
owners (B14). . . . Said a councilman: "It's one of those issues that will tear 
apart the community." 
</P>
<P>
 SCHOOL SEGREGATION: The controversy at Cleveland High in Reseda: whether it's 
right to hold an academic-improvement conference for African American students, 
barring those of other races (B6). . . . Teacher Donna Hill, a sponsor, said 
opening the Jan. 20 meeting might inhibit participation by black students. She 
said she expects controversy, but "it would be a different conference if 
everyone came." 
</P>
<P>
 MAUDE SAVED: Remember the ad? "Buy this magazine or we'll shoot this dog." A 
similar threat came by phone to a Woodland Hills family after their 7-year-old 
Boston terrier, Maude, above, was abducted for ransom. With 15 cops on the case 
-- and a helicopter -- Maude was rescued . . . and a suspected dognaper nabbed 
(B1). 
</P>
<P>
 SATURDAY'S HEROES: The new state open enrollment law, allowing students to 
attend any school in their district with room, is one thing for everyday 
teen-agers, but what about star high school athletes? Some coaches and 
administrators foresee chaos, or at least far-reaching changes (C1). Coaches 
will be tempted to recruit, and athletes to shop around for good deals and 
championship-bound teams. . . . High school athletic officials are trying to 
determine if they should -- or can -- impose limits. 
</P>
<P>
 ONE MORE MARCACCINI: Gianandrea Marcaccini tried to follow in his older 
brothers' footsteps as a basketball player at Notre Dame High in Sherman Oaks, 
but was cut from the team (C10). So he transferred to Crespi in Encino. . . . 
and, in one of his first games, scored 22 points to help defeat Notre Dame. T.

 SLOW WHITEWATER: In Ventura County, where whitewater is something you find on 
Sespe Creek, is anybody talking about the political scandal (A1)? . . . "We had 
a meeting Monday night and there were questions about health care and the 
economy, but not one about Whitewater," said Terri Grando of the 400-member 
Conejo Valley Democratic Club. "Nobody's interested." . . . Not yet, maybe, but 
former county GOP Chairman Richard Ferrier says that may change. . . . "I don't 
think the public can follow the details at this stage -- it's too complicated," 
he said. "And the man in the street is loath to mistrust his President. . . . 
But the reluctance to come clean has planted suspicion. It smells bad." 
</P>
<P>
 FINDING MUSIC: As music teachers become an endangered species at public 
schools, many parents wonder how to introduce children to music (E1). . . . 
Some have turned to private schools, like the Junior Music Academies in 
Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Ventura. "They've cut so much from the arts at 
school," said Pam Lasnik at the Thousand Oaks academy. "It's given us a gap to 
fill." . . . The three schools have 750 students at weekly classes. Cost: $49 a 
month. Parents must go too "so they'll know what to do at home." 
</P>
<P>
 DYING BREED: Speaking of endangered species, don't forget the Elks -- the 
two-footed kind at Ventura County fraternal lodges. Membership is declining, 
and a few lodges may disappear without an infusion of new blood (Ventura County 
Life, Page 24). . . . In 10 years, the Oxnard Elks have declined from 1,200 to 
700. Median age: 69. 
</P>
<P>
 ROAD WARRIORS: For the second time in 20 months, the Oxnard City Council has 
renamed a stretch of what was once Colonia Road. . . . A name change was needed 
to avoid confusion with another part of Colonia Road and, in 1992, Mayor Manuel 
Lopez pushed through Camino de la Raza -- or "Road of the People." But some 
interpreted raza as "common people" and objected to such a plebeian address. . 
. . Now the council has adopted the residents' choice: Camino del Sol. "The 
system works," Lopez said.

SPURT IN DONORS FAILS TO EASE U.S. BLOOD SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 77,000 people have donated blood to the American Red Cross in the 
last four days, but the nation is still experiencing a critical blood shortage, 
the agency said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not out of the woods yet by any means," Red Cross President Elizabeth 
Hanford Dole said."We urgently need more blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Blood centers in eight more cities issued emergency appeals for blood 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross and blood banks last Friday declared the nation's blood shortage 
the worst in Red Cross history. The agency's usual three-day supply of blood 
had dropped to a one-day supply, and several hospitals told the American Assn. 
of Blood Banks that they were postponing elective surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials blamed snowstorms in the East, the virulent Beijing flu that has 
sickened people in at least 17 states, and the holiday season for the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, 30,000 people donated blood to the Red Cross over the weekend, 
23,000 gave on Monday and another 24,567 donated on Tuesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the new donations, the agency's inventory was still just 39,734 units 
of blood, far below the normal level of 67,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood centers in eight more cities, which also serve their surrounding areas, 
are appealing for emergency donations: Knoxville, Tenn.; Kansas City; Portland, 
Ore.; Roanoke and Norfolk, Va.; Savannah, Ga.; Toledo, Ohio; and San Juan, 
Puerto Rico.

DUCKS CONTINUE BLUNDERING HERE BY LOSING TO SHARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All those ticket-buyers with Mighty Duck T-shirts and Duck calls around their 
necks must feel as if they're being bamboozled by now. 
</P>
<P>
 They get reports of an exciting, successful team that wins in such places as 
Maple Leaf Gardens and Chicago Stadium, then pay their money to watch an 
anemic, mistake-prone team at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks turned in a performance marked by a blundering defense and shaky 
goaltending in a 5-2 loss to the San Jose Sharks Wednesday, and fell to 0-5 
against the Sharks -- one loss from being swept in the six-game season series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks only have eight victories this season that didn't come against the 
Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' record at Anaheim Arena fell to 4-14-2, and the home crowd hasn't 
seen the Ducks win in a month, not since an overtime victory over St. Louis 
Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 And still they come -- 17,174, the fourth sellout in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson and his players are left to try to solve the riddle: What to 
do about a team that wins when it isn't supposed to on the road, then loses 
when it's supposed to win against lesser competition at home? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe reverse sweater night? I don't know," Wilson said. "I really don't know 
what to say. The players are having a meeting right now. Ask the players, I'm 
going to ask the players myself tomorrow why we don't play with the same 
intensity at home. Maybe it's the weather, the palm trees. I want to hear what 
their excuses are because I'm sure they have a number of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Team captain Troy Loney called the meeting, and there was a crisis atmosphere 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to figure this thing out at home. It's not doing anybody any good, 
the situation that's going on," Loney said. "We like to try to work things out 
ourselves. We all have different little ideas. We'd like to try to make this 
more of a road game. We should really be happy to come home and play. Right now 
it's just not happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Said right wing Terry Yake: "The bottom line is it's got to come from inside. 
I don't care what you're wearing, what you eat during the day or where you 
sleep. It's got to come from inside -- preparation, right from the morning 
skate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the bottom line. I've tried to make excuses before, and I'm tired of 
it right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks, who managed only 10 shots on goal against the Kings in a 2-2 tie 
Tuesday, had 19 against the Ducks, but scored on four of six in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Johan Garpenlov and Sergei Makarov each had two goals, and Igor Larionov and 
Makarov had four points each. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' success has been built on defense and goaltending, and both were 
off Wednesday. Wilson said the best defenseman was Don McSween, who signed a 
one-year contract with the Ducks after arriving from minor league San Diego 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Guy Hebert entered the game with a 2.74 goals-against average, but 
left in the second period after giving up a goal in the first and three in the 
first 6:28 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 6 1/2 minutes were his undoing. At 1:25 of the second, Makarov picked up 
the puck in the neutral zone, skated in and scored with a rising shot that 
skipped off Hebert's left shoulder and into the net for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks scored a power-play goal at 3:08 on defenseman Bill Houlder's shot 
from the left circle with Jaroslav Otevrel off for hooking. It was Houlder's 
fifth goal in the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Houlder's goal only interrupted the meltdown, though. Larionov scored the 
Sharks' second goal of the period at 4:03, when he eluded the reach of 
defenseman David Williams' stick, then threw a shot at Hebert that landed in 
the crease and bounced in. Larionov appeared to be laughing at his good fortune 
as he headed to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert's last act was to watch Garpenlov score his second goal of the game 
after waltzing into the crease alone, gliding and cutting and finally putting 
it past Hebert. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson took the opportunity to send in Tugnutt, who hadn't been very sharp in 
Monday's 6-4 loss to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 2 1/2 minutes later, and the Sharks with a two-man advantage, 
Tugnutt fell victim too. Makarov's shot from behind the goal line went in off 
the back of Tugnutt's stick.

KINGS TURN UP THE POWER, THEN TURN OFF WHALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Wayne Gretzky's so-called "office" is behind the net, then Luc Robitaille's 
favorite place to work is next to the crease. 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille and Gretzky combined for eight points, and the Kings were 
impressive on the power play in their 6-4 victory over the Hartford Whalers on 
Wednesday night. Gretzky's first goal, at 10:34 of the first period, was his 
2,400th NHL point. 
</P>
<P>
 The fickle nature of the power play ended up leading the Kings as they were 
four for eight. But it also caused them and the sellout crowd of 16,005 at the 
Forum a few anxious moments before it was all over. 
</P>
<P>
 It had appeared as though Robitaille's second goal and fourth point of the 
night decided the issue with 2:48 remaining in the game when he scored on the 
power play after Alexei Zhitnik's slap shot was tipped and trickled under 
Whaler goalie Sean Burke. Robitaille, from the edge of the right crease, had an 
easy tap-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then referee Denis Morel shocked almost everyone by calling a penalty on King 
defenseman Rob Blake with 1:32 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings not only had to kill off the penalty, but it turned into a 
six-on-four advantage when Burke was pulled for an extra attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was going to call it," King Coach Barry Melrose said. "Deja vu. I 
don't know, I'm clairvoyant. I've been watching the Dionne Warwick station." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky ended the suspense by getting his second goal of the night and fourth 
point, finishing off a give-and-go with Jari Kurri with an empty-netter with 36 
seconds remaining. The Kings (17-21-4) are 6-2-1 in their last nine games and 
are one point out of a playoff spot.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was like pulling teeth tonight," Melrose said. "The game last night took a 
lot out of us. It was very hard. We weren't at our best tonight, but we still 
found a way to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Whaler Coach Pierre McGuire: "Their power play is obviously very 
talented. You are talking about a lot of rifles there, and they're all full of 
bullets." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it turned into a close game when the Whalers scored twice to tie the 
score, 4-4, starting with Geoff Sanderson's power-play goal at 18:41 of the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the third, the Kings could only dodge the danger of the breakaway so 
long. Goaltender Kelly Hrudey stopped the Whalers' first three breakaways, but 
forward Michael Nylander converted on the fourth at 5:10 of the third. 
Nylander, having been shut out twice on breakaways, figured Hrudey out on his 
third of the night to tie the score at 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Until late in the second, it had seemed as though the Kings' potent power play 
would be enough to give them some room against Hartford since the Kings have 
the NHL's best power play at home with a success rate of 29.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the power-play goals came in the second period from Robitaille at 9:20 
and Tomas Sandstrom at 13:28. Those goals gave the Kings a 4-2 lead. It was 
Robitaille's 23rd of the season and 14th on the power play. Sandstrom, who has 
15 goals, has scored five goals in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two King goals came from Kurri at 2:32 of the second period and 
Gretzky on the power play at 10:34 of the first. Gretzky scored when his shot 
from the lower right circle went off defenseman Bryan Marchment's skate and 
squirted between Burke's pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's two goals were his 18th and 19th of the season, and he now needs 18 
goals to pass Gordie Howe's all-time record of 801 NHL goals. He had been 
thinking about his 2,400th point, saying: "It's kind of funny. For someone to 
break that, they'd have to play 24 years and score 100 points a year. So I 
guess that's pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Melrose was pleased with forward Dixon Ward's debut on Tuesday 
night against San Jose. Ward, acquired on Saturday from Vancouver for center 
Jimmy Carson, had three good scoring opportunities, fought Bob Errey and drew a 
penalty to give the Kings a power play late in the game. "I liked him," Melrose 
said. "He checks. He can take draws. He did everything. He's like a bigger 
(Tony) Granato. He makes people mad at him." . . . Left wing Warren Rychel 
(left ankle bruise) was scratched against the Whalers. Right wing Dave Taylor 
(concussion) was scratched for the third consecutive game. Defenseman Rob Blake 
(sprained knee) was going to sit out, but he took the pregame warm-up and felt 
good enough to play. Forward Phil Crowe was a healthy scratch.

MORNING BRIEFING: WILL BUDDY'S DOME BECOME JOE'S PERSONAL HOUSE OF PAIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post has this warning to Joe Montana when 
the Kansas City Chiefs play the Houston Oilers in the Astrodome on Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is 'Earth To . . . ' Buddy Ryan we're talking about. Do you actually 
think Buddy is going to let Joe Montana beat him? If Buddy punched out his own 
coach, what do you think he'd do to Montana? Buddy's going to put a bounty on 
Montana. Did you see what the Giants did to the punk doofus McMahon on Sunday 
-- when they left him twitching on the turf, and the trainer came out and 
appeared to be delivering the last rites? Buddy was taking notes on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buddy is way out of control. Buddy is so far over the line he needs a cab to 
get back." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Kornheiser: "Buddy has been beaten by Montana before: In 1984, when Buddy 
was the defensive coordinator for Da Bears, Montana came into Soldier Field in 
the playoffs and blanked them, 23-0. And in 1989, when Buddy was coaching the 
Eagles, Montana came into Veterans Stadium and threw five touchdown passes -- 
four in the last quarter! -- and beat Buddy, 38-28. Buddy is going to run guys 
at Montana the way they run bulls through Pamplona." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was Lord Stanley, who originated the Stanley Cup in 1893? 
</P>
<P>
 Open game: The Raiders advancing in the playoffs might be good news for the 
city of Los Angeles, but the attention the team has brought to the area 
surrounding the Coliseum has been nothing but negative. This latest criticism 
is from C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle, who writes: "It was just 10 
years ago that the Coliseum was being spruced up to showcase 100 white grand 
pianos for the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now it looks like a good spot for a guy with a harmonica and tin cup." 
</P>
<P>
 More bad news for L.A.: The Toronto Sun recently conducted its sixth annual 
talent poll, ranking the NHL's top players and executives. Toronto's Cliff 
Fletcher was rated the NHL's No. 1 general manager with a three-way tie for 
second place between Florida's Bob Clarke, Boston's Harry Sinden and the 
Rangers' Neil Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 And the worst? A tie between the Kings' Nick Beverley and Winnipeg's Mike 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 It's in the tie: The five-member panel also assessed the NHL's top-dressed 
coaches, in order of finish: Pat Burns (Toronto), Glen Sather (Edmonton), Mike 
Keenan (Rangers), Pat Quinn (Vancouver), Barry Melrose (Kings), Rick Bowness 
(Ottawa) and Ron Wilson (Anaheim). 
</P>
<P>
 Not knuckling under: Former major leaguer Phil Niekro had visions of Tom Hanks 
when he was approached to manage a women's baseball team recently. But Niekro 
says his team, the Colorado Silver Bullets, will differ greatly from the team 
that Hanks managed in the movie, "A League of Their Own." 
</P>
<P>
 Niekro's team will play against Class-A men's minor league teams in Knoxville, 
Tenn. Nevertheless Niekro is undaunted by skepticism, and guarantees that his 
team "will be more competitive than a lot of people think they will be."  
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: He was governor general of Canada at the time, according to the 
Amateur Athletic Foundation.

 As the Pacific 10 Conference slowly--perhaps too slowly for its own 
good--positions itself for inevitable expansion, the question of who, when and 
how many becomes an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has to expand. If it doesn't, the Pac-10 soon will find itself 
choking on the exhaust fumes of the Southeastern, Big Ten and Atlantic Coast 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this isn't about pride, it's about money. The stronger the 
conference, the stronger the clout. The stronger the clout, the better chance 
of athletic directors hearing that magical sound: cha-ching . 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen isn't saying much about expansion, 
other than it remains a possible priority. But others, including a high-ranking 
athletic department official at the University of Texas, are talking, albeit 
off the record. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Longhorn official, two factors could hasten Texas' departure, 
possibly to the Pac-10: 1) The NCAA's recent decision to place Texas A&M on 
five years' probation, including next season without TV and bowl appearances; 
2) The upcoming College Football Assn. deal with the TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Texas A&M, the Southwest Conference, of which Texas is a member, loses 
precious TV revenue and publicity. "I think it could open the door," the Texas 
official said. "And the CFA TV deal is going to be crucial." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Texas has about a $20-million athletic department budget. 
Someone has to pay for it and it isn't going to be Bevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "(SWC Commissioner Steve) Hatchell is trying to avoid (losing Texas)," the 
Longhorn official said. "He says, 'You guys are staying.' I know we're 
definitely committed for two years (through 1995)." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, who knows? Texas vs. UCLA at Pauley for the Pac-10 championship? 
</P>
<P>
 There are problems, of course. Texas might not be interested in a partnership, 
especially when it comes to football. Oregon State vs. Texas doesn't do much 
for the Longhorn sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is this matter of approval. According to the Texas official, at 
least one Pac-10 school has made it previously clear that it wouldn't be in 
favor of adding the Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Texas might stay put because of Hatchell's longstanding friendship 
with Longhorn Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hatchell and DeLoss are tight," said another source familiar with the 
situation. "That might be enough to save Texas from leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 For now. PLENTY OF SEATS AVAILABLE 
</P>
<P>
 After conducting a detailed examination of the Tennessee basketball program 
last year, Athletic Director Doug Dickey proclaimed the patient in good health, 
so much so that he extended the contract of Coach Wade Houston through the 
1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, well, perhaps it's time to check the pulse again. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are the Volunteers 2-9 (0-3 in Southeastern Conference play), but the 
school isn't being helped financially, either. So dreadful has been the 
attendance at massive Thompson-Boling Arena that you could take the combined 
crowd counts from Tennessee's first four home games and it still wouldn't be 
enough to fill the 24,535-seat facility. 
</P>
<P>
 At last check, the Volunteers were averaging a turnstile count of 5,449 
through their first six games. As recently as the 1987-88 season, the average 
turnstile attendance was 14,993. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Lady Volunteers, ranked No. 1 in the country, recently drew a 
crowd of 15,312 at Thompson-Boling for a game against Louisiana State. In fact, 
the women's team has a higher per-game turnstile average than the men: 5,481 
(through seven games) to 5,449. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players have to generate the enthusiasm," said Houston, a decent man who 
happens to be caught between a rock and a pink slip. "If that happens, I think 
the crowd will get behind the team, make a lot of noise and support the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston shouldn't hold his breath. The story goes that someone recently called 
the Tennessee basketball ticket office in search of a starting time for an 
upcoming game. 
</P>
<P>
 "What time is tipoff?" the caller asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "What time can you be here?" came the reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a miracle turnaround, Dickey has some sticky decisions to make. He can 
stand by his man, but risk seeing more empty seats. He can jettison Houston at 
season's end, but risk incurring the wrath of the Black Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 If he fires Houston, the possible candidates are endless. Does Dickey make 
another run at Florida State's Pat Kennedy, who turned down the job to begin 
with? Does he go after Tulane's Perry Clark? Or, in a daring try, does he court 
longtime Tennessee recruiting nemesis Larry Finch of Memphis State? PLANES, 
TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph's loss to Rhode Island last Sunday shouldn't come as a surprise. 
After all, this was the only team in America with train lag. 
</P>
<P>
 The original travel itinerary called for St. Joseph's to leave Friday for 
Saturday's game against the Rams. Instead. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks arrived at the Philadelphia airport for their 4 p.m. flight. It was 
delayed once, twice, and then canceled because of the snowstorm that hit the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph's Coach John Griffin and his team returned to the airport the next 
morning for a 10 o'clock flight. It was canceled. They booked seats on the 1 
p.m. flight. It was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 With no way to make the Saturday game in time, the contest was rescheduled for 
Sunday. To get to Kingston, R.I., the Hawks boarded a 1:30 p.m. train, arriving 
about six hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of the way teams used to travel years ago, when planes weren't so 
accessible," Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin wasn't in such a nostalgic mood during the trip. Because every seat 
was taken, the coaches, players, trainers and managers spent nearly the first 
two hours of the ride stuck between cars with all their equipment and luggage. 
It wasn't until later that the team was able to store its baggage and actually 
sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't exactly what you'd call first-class travel," Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to Griffin's newest request to Atlantic 10 Conference 
executives. "I'm waiting for the league to bring in a southern team so we don't 
have to worry about these things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, during a trip to St. Bonaventure, Griffin watched in amazement as 
the team bus left the Buffalo Airport without the team. A replacement bus was 
ordered, but its windshield was shattered by heavy clumps of snow, the result 
of an over-efficient snowplow driver who cleared the stuff from an overpass 
just as the St. Joseph's vehicle approached. THE TOPS AND FLOPS 
</P>
<P>
 Five early-season surprises: 
</P>
<P>
 STANFORD--Seven victories last season, nine already this season. 
</P>
<P>
 WEST VIRGINIA--Upset of Temple was no fluke. Better yet, whiner extraordinaire 
Don Nehlen isn't the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTANA--A polite round of applause, please, for the Grizzlies' 13-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
 ST. LOUIS--Last year, Coach Charlie Spoonhour's first at St. Louis, he more 
than doubled the number of Billiken victories, from five to 12. This season, 
his team is 12-0, which means he might double the victories again. 
</P>
<P>
 PURDUE--With Glenn Robinson, the Boilermakers are off to a 14-0 start. Without 
him, they're Oswego State. 
</P>
<P>
 HONORABLE MENTION: Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
 Five early-season disappointments: 
</P>
<P>
 GEORGETOWN--The Hoyas, the preseason choice to win the Big East title, are off 
to an uninspired start. 
</P>
<P>
 TEXAS--Lots of talent, but only 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 TEXAS A&M--So much for the Aggie renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PATRIOT LEAGUE--Earlier in the week, seven of the eight teams had losing 
overall records. Only Navy had a .500 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 MEMPHIS STATE--A penny for Larry Finch's thoughts. Finch knew he would miss 
Anfernee Hardaway, but not this much. 
</P>
<P>
 HONORABLE MENTION: Miami. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut's victory over Syracuse on Monday night gave the Huskies their 
first 4-0 start in the Big East Conference. UConn, 13-1 overall, is still 
trying to figure out how it lost to Ohio of the Mid-American Conference. . . . 
The SEC schedule is only about three games old, but already there is a 
groundswell of support for Georgia as the team most capable of unseating 
Kentucky as the Eastern Division champion. All things considered, the Bulldogs 
might have the most talent in the league, as evidenced by their recent upset of 
the Wildcats. "We're going to find out if we can handle prosperity," Georgia 
Coach Hugh Durham said. "There's one thing you have to understand about the 
Kentuckys and Arkansas: they can handle prosperity because they keep winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Webber, he isn't, but 6-foot-8 freshman forward Makhtar Ndiaye will be a 
welcome addition at Michigan. The Wolverines are in dire need of rebounding and 
depth on the inside. Ndiaye, who chose Michigan over UCLA, originally signed 
with Wake Forest, but was later ruled ineligible there because of NCAA 
recruiting violations. . . . North Carolina was the preseason No. 1, lost it 
and got it back, but is likely to lose it again after being routed by Georgia 
Tech, 89-69, Wednesday night. Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino said earlier in the 
week that he sees upsets aplenty for the nation's top teams, now that 
conference schedules have begun. "Unless you play in a weak league, where you 
can dominate a league, (the upsets) are going to happen every week," he said. 
"I think Duke and Carolina will get beat in the league. Indiana, Purdue, 
Wisconsin . . . will get beat in the league." The same goes for teams in the 
Big East and all the major conferences, Pitino said. "I think you will see lots 
of changes (in the rankings)," he said. "The key is not to lose at home. That's 
the key to playing in a league." Top 10

PACIFIC 10 BASKETBALL / DAN HAFNER; APPROACHING TOP FORM, CAL FACES ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When California made its coaching switch last February, most of the talk was 
about Lou Campanelli's firing. There was hardly a mention of interim Coach Todd 
Bozeman, except to say he was only 30 and inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Bears handed Arizona its only Pacific 10 Conference defeat less 
than a month after Bozeman took over, he became much more than a fill-in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears, who were 4-5 in conference play when Bozeman became coach, won nine 
of their last 10 regular-season games and went on to upset Duke in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start this season, probably because of injuries, the Bears appear 
to be rounding into form entering tonight's game against Arizona in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (12-1) lost only to Kentucky by a point on a tip-in at the 
buzzer. They were impressive in their Pac-10 opener against Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears (9-2), who were without two injured starters, K.J. Roberts and 
Alfred Grigsby, were 2-2 to open the season and dropped out of the rankings. 
But they have won seven in a row, including routs last week of Washington State 
and Washington. Grigsby may play in one of the two games in Arizona, but 
Roberts is probably out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal-Arizona game will feature three of the nation's best guards. Foremost 
is Jason Kidd, with his quick hands and uncanny vision. Only a bit behind are 
Arizona's Damon Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves. Reeves, who averages 24.5 points, 
and Stoudamire, 18.8, are second and fourth, respectively in scoring in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader, though, is Lamond Murray of the Bears. Although he is playing out 
of position at power forward in the absence of Grigsby, Murray has been 
impressive. He is averaging 24.9 points and almost seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal's slow start might have been affected by two freshmen, 6-foot-10 Michael 
Stewart and guard Randy Duck, who were so-so at first and have been coming on 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart set a Cal record by blocking five shots against Washington, and Duck 
has had a chance to gain valuable experience with Roberts injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, of course, is Kidd. Although bothered by a cold last week, the Cal 
sophomore continues to lead the Pac-10 in steals (3.5 per game) and assists 
(9.1). 
</P>
<P>
 "The injuries only helped strengthen us," said Kidd, who is already No. 3 in 
steals on the all-time Cal list. "No matter who's been hurt and who's playing 
out of position, nobody's complaining." 
</P>
<P>
 For a portion of the one-sided victory over Washington, Bozeman, 20-4 as head 
coach, used five guards at the same time. The big man was 6-6 Monty Buckley, 
who plays both guard and forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray totaled 62 points against the Washington schools, making 19 of 24 shots 
from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears' weakness has been free-throw shooting at 63.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe, we're making too much of it," Bozeman said. "I just hope if we get 
down to where we need one (that) Lamond (80.8%) is the shooter." 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, who is shooting 59.1% from three-point range, is only 61.2% from the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brevin Knight is barely 18, only 5-10 and weighs 155 pounds, but the freshman 
from Seton Hall, N.J., has been a big man for Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight, who took over as point guard from the start of practice, is one of the 
main reasons the surprising Cardinal is 9-2 after winning only seven games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight made a 16-foot jumper at the buzzer last Thursday night to beat 
Washington, 67-65, then had 18 points in a 75-64 victory over Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 He will lead Stanford's attempt to register upsets in Arizona this week. 
Stanford is at Arizona State tonight and at Arizona on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a rule, you don't want to have a freshman running your offense," Coach 
Mike Montgomery said. "So we brought in a junior college All-American and 
Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no time at all, Knight moved in, and the other fellow (Frank Harris) moved 
out -- right out of school." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he wasn't really surprised at his team's fast start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a better team than a seven-game winner last season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac-10 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Bennett, the 6-9 Arizona State forward who missed all of last season 
after knee surgery, apparently is back in form. In his third game in two years, 
Bennett scored 27 points in a loss to St. Louis last Saturday night. . . . 
Oregon freshman Kenya Wilkins from Dorsey High averages 9.6 points and 4.2 
assists going into Saturday night's game against Oregon State at Eugene. . . . 
Brevin Knight gets his unusual first name from the first three letters in his 
mother's name (Brenda) and the last three in his father's (Kevin). . . . 
Arizona has beaten Stanford 10 times in a row at Tucson.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; USC TO PLAY HOST TO WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ninth-ranked USC will play No. 16 Washington in a game matching the Pacific 10 
Conference's two unbeaten women's basketball teams tonight at USC's Lyon 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 While USC, 9-1 overall and 2-0 in the Pac-10, and Washington (10-1, 2-0) play, 
Washington State (6-5, 1-1) will be playing UCLA (6-5, 1-1) at Pauley 
Pavilion.The USC game begins at 7:30 p.m., the UCLA game at 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has won nine in a row, most recently home victories over Stanford 
(78-61) and California (95-60). It was Stanford's largest margin of defeat in 
its last 80 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies -- who play at UCLA on Saturday at 2 p.m. -- have been led by 
junior Rhonda Smith, who had 15 points and eight rebounds in the rout of 
fifth-ranked Stanford and held the Cardinal's Anita Kaplan to six points, 10.6 
below her average.  
</P>
<P>
 USC, meanwhile, survived close calls last week in Oregon, defeating Oregon 
State, 63-56, last Thursday and beating Oregon, 47-45 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA lost, 82-77, at Oregon but beat Oregon State, 76-61. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins outscored Oregon State, 30-4, over the last 12 minutes at 
Corvallis. During one stretch, UCLA's Natalie Williams scored 13 of UCLA's 24 
points. She finished with 26 points and 13 rebounds. EARL GUSTKEY

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; MCGLOCKTON'S INJURY LEAVES A BIG HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An area of concern for the Raiders against Buffalo on Sunday is finding 
someone to replace defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, who was put on injured 
reserve after suffering a broken fibula against Denver last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing McGlockton is a big loss for us because he is such a key factor in our 
defensive line scheme," Coach Art Shell said Wednesday. "But when you lose 
people, everybody has to pick up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
 After McGlockton went down on Denver's first offensive play, Willie Broughton, 
a six-year veteran from Miami, filled in and played well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stepped in and made some plays for us," Shell said of Broughton, who 
started eight games last season. "There were a couple plays when you saw him in 
there chasing the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for Saturday's 9:30 a.m. PST kickoff against the Bills, the 
Raiders moved their practice time up from 2 p.m. to 9:30 a.m. this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know its going to be cold and there's nothing we can do about that," Shell 
said. "But it is important to get some good practice time, and I'd rather 
practice here than there. The only thing we've changed is our practice time. 
Practicing early has been good for us. In fact, a couple of players walked up 
to me and said that they thought it was a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will practice this morning before leaving at 3 p.m. for Buffalo.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to get Shell emotional, ask him about Gerald Perry's absence from 
the AFC Pro Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gerald was like the third alternate on the team and that's wrong," Shell 
said. "There's no way that there are five tackles in the league that are better 
than him. He's shut down all the top players all season and he's left off the 
team. That's not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell blames the voting process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole Pro Bowl thing started going in the wrong direction when they 
started having the players vote. Now they have fans voting and they just don't 
know. The coaches are the ones who watch film and see players all year long."

 Coach Mike Holmgren knows the line, and he wants to make sure his Green Bay 
Packers know it too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys are 14-point favorites over the Packers for Sunday's NFC 
divisional playoff at Texas Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lot in this league," Holmgren said. "They (players) look at those 
things. They're human. It conjures up some emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't buy that 13-point underdog thing," defensive back Terrell Buckley 
said. "Half the time, they (oddsmakers) are not right."

 Author Tom Clancy is heading a partnership interested in buying the New 
England Patriots and moving the team to Hartford, a Connecticut official said 
Wednesday night. The Connecticut Development Authority agreed after a daylong 
meeting to back up with state bonds a bid by Clancy's group to purchase the NFL 
franchise, CDA president and executive director John J.C. Herndon said. . . . 
Ron Lynn resigned as defensive coordinator of the Cincinnati Bengals.

SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE; LACK OF SNOW IS LEAVING SOME RESORT OWNERS OUT IN THE 
COLD

 Hey kids, anyone for some dirt-boarding? 
</P>
<P>
 It's approaching mid-January, yet dirt is still the only skiable surface at 
some local resorts. At Big Air Green Valley near Running Springs, proprietor 
Eric Schwartz is running out of patience as he awaits the coming of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just finished building a judges' stand for an event that we're not going to 
have Sunday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The snowboarding-only area opened for a week in December but has been closed 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bleak, I'm very depressed," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is life without snow-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Areas that have been able to make enough of their own snow are surviving what 
has so far been a dry winter. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one ski insider said this week the best skiing in California right 
now might be at the three Big Bear resorts, which have taken advantage of 
technology and cool temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the good news. Mt. Waterman and Krakta Ridge have yet to open. Ski 
Sunrise in Wrightwood opened in December, but is closed again because of lack 
of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Baldy closed Wednesday because of strong winds, but hopes to reopen later 
in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Southern California," Schwartz said. "Part of you gets upset. I've 
thought of sacrificing virgins, but that doesn't work. I had high hopes, but we 
still have two months left." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said he had plans to invest in a snow-maker, at a cost of $500,000 
after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was taking a chance," he said. "I was hoping this would be a good year." 
</P>

 As the World (Cup) turns . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What is it with the International Ski Federation (FIS), the sport's alleged 
governing body? Las Vegas should lays odds as to when these Euro-crats will 
next do something right. 
</P>
<P>
 Another week, another FIS controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Every nation involved in last Saturday's super-giant slalom at Altenmarkt, 
Austria -- with the exception of Austria and Switzerland -- was expected to 
officially protest the outcome of the race, which was at first halted after 32 
racers because of slick course conditions that caused 26 skiers to crash in a 
frozen finish area. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's Astrid Loedemel was seriously injured on the course, and Megan Gerety 
of the United States wiped out a television crew when she crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Loedemel, the top woman with a medal hope in her home country Olympics next 
month, tore right knee ligaments and will require surgery, ending this year's 
Olympic dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, after protestations from the Swiss, who had at stake the race's leader, 
Heidi Zurbriggen, FIS later deemed the Altenmarkt results official. 
</P>
<P>
 Rules? According to World Cup bylaws, an abandoned race doesn't count if fewer 
than half the field has completed the course. Eighty-five racers entered the 
Altenmarkt super-G. Only 32 finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Either FIS chucked the rule book or invented an interesting new math. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll recall, this is the same FIS outfit that stripped the United States' AJ 
Kitt of a World Cup downhill victory last year at Aspen when it canceled the 
race because of a small hole on the course created -- skiers maintained -- by 
FIS course designers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. ski team officials are hoarse from screaming about the FIS' double 
standards and now can add Altenmarkt to their files. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we organized a race like this in the U.S., they (FIS) would have our 
heads," U.S. Alpine Coach Paul Major said after Altenmarkt. "It was an 
embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Major maintains the race should have never been run, even though the United 
States ended up with an an eighth-place finisher who desperately needed the 
result: Diann Roffe-Steinrotter. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests, we boldly predict, will fall on deaf ears at FIS. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Major will tell you, it feels good to scream. 
</P>
<P>
 Skiing, the dangerous sport. 
</P>
<P>
 FIS, its dangerous leader.

 The U.S. Alpine team's tough-stance Olympic qualifying criteria have served as 
a wake-up call to two U.S. veterans who, at least on paper, were in jeopardy of 
not qualifying for the Olypmic team, to be announced Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Parisien and Roffe-Steinrotter, two former Olympians who had not yet met 
the U.S. team's self-imposed guidelines, responded with top-10 finishes last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien was eighth at the Altenmarkt slalom, her best finish of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist in giant slalom, finished 
eighth in a Saturday's controversial super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly two years in the skiing doldrums, Roffe-Steinrotter appears to be 
at last gaining momentum, having finished 13th in a giant slalom at Morzine, 
France, the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diann seems to be getting a little more fire, which is what she needs." Major 
said last week. "She's getting a little more ornery every day, and that's what 
I want to see. The more difficult she is to be around, the better she is." 
</P>
<P>
 With the top-10 finishes, Parisien and Roffe-Steinrotter each have three top 
15 finishes this season, enough to qualify based on the Olympic criteria. 
</P>

 Ski Notes

 Donna Weinbrecht, Olympic freestyle moguls champion, continued her impressive 
comeback from a knee injury by winning her third World Cup event of the season 
last weekend at Blackcomb, British Columbia. Weinbrecht, 28, from West Milford, 
N.J., missed all of last season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in 
her right knee during training in November of 1992. The victory at Blackcomb 
was the 27th World Cup victory for Weinbrecht, who shows no signs of rust as 
she prepares to defend her Olympic championship at Lillehammer, Norway, next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of her last tuneups before the Olympics, Weinbrecht will compete 
Saturday in the Alamo Freestyle Classic at Breckenridge, Colo. It was at 
Breckenridge in 1992 that Weinbrecht injured her right knee in training while 
trying to complete jump called a Daffy Twister. . . . World Cup freestyle 
champion Trace Worthington, who injured his right knee in training last week, 
said he plans to be back in time for the Olympics. Tests revealed only a 
partial tear in the medial collateral ligament. The U.S. freestyle team will be 
selected after the Subaru Freestyle International at Lake Placid, N.Y., Jan. 
20-23. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the glimmer of hope for the U.S. technical team. After spending two 
weeks training at home in Park City, Jeremy Nobis rejoined the team in Europe 
and missed the top-30 first-run cut by .05 seconds at a GS last week at Kranjsk 
Gora, Slovenia. . . . The United States' Doug Lewis defeated 11 racing greats 
last Sunday at Aspen to win the first King of the Mountain downhill race. 
Lewis, whose time was 2 minutes 4.06 seconds, picked up $25,000 for the 
victory. Lewis, a member of the U.S. ski team from 1980-88, won the bronze 
medal in the 1985 championships in Bormio, Italy, and was the U.S. national 
downhill champion in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Conradin Cathomen of Switzerland finished second, with race organizer Bill 
Johnson, the former American Olympic gold medalist, finishing third.

 Selecting an All-American auto racing team can be a difficult task in some 
years, but in 1993 most of the choices for the American Auto Racing Writers & 
Broadcasters Assn. team were easy picks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt, the Winston Cup champion for the sixth time driving a 
Chevrolet Lumina, and Rusty Wallace, whose 10 victories in a Pontiac Grand Prix 
brought him close to Earnhardt, were obvious selections in the stock car 
category. It was Earnhardt's sixth time and Wallace's third as first-team 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigel Mansell, the charismatic Englishman who won the PPG Cup Indy Car 
championship with a Lola-Ford Cosworth in his first try after having won the 
Formula One crown a year earlier; and Paul Tracy, the young Canadian who 
matched Mansell with five victories in a Penske-Chevrolet, were obvious 
selections in the open-wheel division. Left out was Emerson Fittipaldi, Tracy's 
teammate and the Indianapolis 500 winner. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Mansell's first time on the team, in his first venture into American 
racing. For Tracy, who had replaced Rick Mears on the Penske team and drove in 
his first full Indy car season, it was his second selection. In 1990, he had 
received an at-large berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Hill and John Force were standouts for the drag-racing portion of the 
12-driver team. Hill, 57, became the oldest professional driver to win a 
national event, much less a championship, when he earned his first National Hot 
Rod Assn. top-fuel title with a record-tying six-victory season. Force won the 
funny-car class in an Olds Cutlass with a record 11 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Each so dominated his class that no other top-fuel or funny-car driver won 
more than two races. Force also made the first team in 1991, but it was the 
first time for Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Manuel Fangio II, winner of the Jerry Titus Award last year as the 
leading vote-getter in AARWBA balloting, again headed the road-racing category 
after driving a Toyota Eagle to the final International Motor Sports Assn. 
Camel GT series championship. Fangio won seven races, matching his 1992 total, 
in edging teammate P.J. Jones for the crown. He was joined by Scott Sharp, the 
Trans-Am champion, who won six races in his Camaro. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second selection for both road racers, Fangio getting the honor 
last year and Sharp in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kinser, with 13 World of Outlaw sprint-car championships in 15 years, 
was selected to one of the short-track berths for the 12th time. Kinser won 19 
of the Outlaws' 68 races. The other berth went to Chevrolet driver Johnny 
Benson Jr., champion of the American Speed Assn. stock car circuit. Benson, a 
first-time selection, edged Mike Bliss, the United States Auto Club's Silver 
Crown champion, by a single vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Shuman, who was not on the AARWBA ballot, might have been a more deserving 
selection. Shuman had the USAC Silver Crown title apparently won at the end of 
the final race, but when one driver was penalized after the checkered flag, it 
moved Bliss up one position and he finished the season two points ahead of 
Shuman. The Arizona veteran also won his eighth Turkey Night Midget Grand Prix, 
one of USAC's most prestigious races, and three California Racing Assn. sprint 
car features. 
</P>
<P>
 At-large selections were off-road racer Ivan Stewart and Indy Lights champion 
Bryan Herta. Stewart dominated off-road racing, winning the SCORE International 
series in his Toyota truck by sweeping both Baja races, the 500 and the 1000. 
In the Baja 1000, he drove solo and won the overall championship by beating all 
the motorcycles as well as four-wheeled competition. It was the first time a 
truck had won overall since 1979. Stewart also won stadium races in San Diego, 
Las Vegas and the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Herta won seven of 12 Indy Lights races, but his at-large position on the 
All-America team is a bit suspect because even though the Lights series is 
promoted as a training ground for future Indy drivers, Herta was selected over 
established Indy drivers such as Fittipaldi, Al Unser Jr., Danny Sullivan and 
Mario Andretti, all of whom won Indy car races on the major league circuit. The 
Titus Award winner, which will be chosen from among Earnhardt, Force and 
Mansell, will be announced Saturday night at the AARWBA banquet in Charlotte, 
N.C.

MORALE BLAMED FOR DROP IN ARRESTS; LAPD: THE POLICE UNION SAYS DRUNK-DRIVING 
ARRESTS AND CITATIONS OVERALL HAVE DECLINED BECAUSE OFFICERS FEAR REPRISALS AND 
ARE ANGERED BY STALLED CONTRACT TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of citations and drunk-driving arrests by the Los Angeles Police 
Department has dropped precipitously in recent years, a decrease that union 
leaders say is the result of heightened reluctance by officers to place 
themselves in harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that right now, police officers are totally frustrated," Danny 
Staggs, the newly elected president of the Los Angeles Police Protective 
League, said at a news conference Wednesday. "Our officers are afraid" of being 
disciplined or prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs and other league officials said the declining number of citations and 
arrests reflects the LAPD's plummeting morale, and they called on elected 
officials to end long-stalled contract talks and give police officers a raise. 
Morale problems within the department have been widely reported, and officials 
as high as Police Chief Willie L. Williams have acknowledged for months that 
many officers are unhappy in their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Less clear is to what extent the decline in morale has affected the number or 
nature of arrests. A recent memo by a ranking member of the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office cited a "deplorable lack of investigative work" by 
LAPD detectives. But the author of that memo blamed that problem primarily on a 
shortage of investigators, not low morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district attorney's memo contained no statistical evidence, the 
figures released by the league and the department show dramatic drops in the 
number of citations and drunk-driving arrests. Both declines, union officials 
say, are the result of officers being afraid to confront suspects for fear of 
being disciplined or prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not doing proactive police work like they used to," Staggs said of 
the LAPD rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Police Department figures, police officers issued 735,841 
citations in 1989; last year, that number dropped to 333,763 through November. 
Drunk-driving arrests, meanwhile, plummeted from 26,320 in 1989 to 13,375 
during the first 11 months of last year. Although department officials 
acknowledge that the number of traffic citations and arrests for certain crimes 
has dropped in recent years, they attribute the decline to more than just low 
morale. 
</P>
<P>
 The department, for instance, has been depleted by attrition and a hiring 
freeze. According to league officials, 451 officers left the force in 1993; the 
LAPD says it hired only 271 replacements. As a result, the number of officers 
making arrests and issuing citations has declined by about 2%. Arrests for the 
most serious offenses have remained relatively stable during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD also used to make a large number of arrests in sweep operations, a 
tactic favored by former Chief Daryl F. Gates. Those sweeps have been 
discontinued in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, other department statistics suggest that one reason for the decline 
in drunk-driving arrests may be that fewer people are driving while 
intoxicated. Serious accidents involving drunk drivers have declined over the 
past few years, as have serious accidents overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of issues that are affecting citations and arrests for 
some crimes," said Lt. John Dunkin, a spokesman for the department. "One of 
those is that we are a smaller department." 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue, Dunkin said, is that officers are now so overwhelmed with calls 
that they have little time to issue citations or to make arrests for anything 
less than serious crimes. "When an officer gets in the car today, he has six 
calls already in the queue," Dunkin said. "He's constantly running from call to 
call." 
</P>
<P>
 With the league lobbying for a new contract, its leaders Wednesday expressed 
disappointment in Mayor Richard Riordan's leadership. A major Riordan campaign 
plank was that he would improve law enforcement, and he won the backing of the 
Police Protective League. 
</P>
<P>
 But after six months of the Riordan Administration, the league has grown 
increasingly frustrated with the mayor, complaining that he has done little, if 
anything, to bring the contract talks to a conclusion. League leaders are 
particularly angry that Riordan has devoted millions of dollars to his campaign 
to hire more officers while not finding money to give current officers a pay 
raise. Officers are seeking a salary increase of 3% per year for each of the 
next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that Mayor Riordan should have first settled our contract before 
talking about expanding this department," Staggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Castro, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said Administration officials 
would have no comment about the contract talks. Enforcement Trends Traffic 
citations and drunk-driving arrests by LAPD officers have dropped dramatically 
in recent years, a decline police union leaders attribute to officers 
hesitating to confront suspects. Department leaders acknowledge the declines, 
but say many other factors are at work, including the shrinking size of the 
force in recent years.

RECENT QUAKE SWARM HAS WESTSIDE FEELING SHAKY; TEMBLORS: AS SCALE READINGS GO, 
THE RECENT RUMBLES HAVEN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY LARGE OR DANGEROUS. BUT TRY

 "I thought a boat blew up in the harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like an express train rolling through our hotel room." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like someone ran into the building with a truck." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a big CRUNK."  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was a 3.7-magnitude earthquake, the kind that seismologists say 
is "getting to the point where it would barely do a little bit of damage." 
Seasoned earthquake reporters have been known to refuse to get out of bed for 
anything less than a 4.5. In Barstow, 3.7s can happen every week, but nobody 
cares, unless you're in Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, the Little Ones happened on the Westside of Los Angeles. In 
fact, they keep happening -- in the past three days there have been four in the 
3 range and a several in the 2 range. They are so small that people in Downtown 
Los Angeles hardly feel them. If you are jogging, you might miss the whole 
thing. So, one might ask, how bad can it be? 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Monica is accustomed to rolling on the fringes of earthquakes 
centered a comfy distance away, like in the desert. Santa Monica is not 
accustomed to sitting almost on top of the epicenter, and residents expect the 
rest of us to have the decency to pay attention when it appears their world of 
free-range chicken, lobster risotto and loafers without socks is about to 
collapse.

<P>
 They scan the television stations searching desperately for a news flash. They 
call the local newspaper demanding to know why the latest 2-point-something 
wasn't on the front page. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching the Raiders. They were playing at the Coliseum and they didn't 
even react! It wasn't on TV for at least 45 minutes," Adrian Gonzalez, a recent 
UCLA grad and lifetime Westside resident said with astonishment. 
</P>
<P>
 He was so beside himself that he slept right through another one two nights 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it goes here. In earthquake terms, these shakers are small 
potatoes. But sitting in the middle of one has a way of grabbing your 
attention. You get that sinking feeling in your stomach, briefly contemplate 
The Big One, imagine Montana Avenue dropping into the sea, then go back to 
writing your screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It permits us to stop using the stir sticks in our cappuccinos," said 
comedian Chris Barnes, who does improvisation at Upfront, a club in the Third 
Street Promenade, where he and several others were performing one night this 
week when the whole place went thud. ("That's what happens when you don't 
laugh," one comic hollered at the audience. Then the show went on.) 
</P>
<P>
 Westsiders seem to react in a variety of ways. They duck under the door frame. 
They run outside. They size up what fell off the wall and if so, who got hit on 
the head. One Venice man set his earthquake kit and his cat carrier next to the 
door and went back to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hardly seem to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple visiting their children from Philadelphia was browsing in J.C. 
Penney's when a 3.2 hit at 11:28 a.m. Wednesday. "There were people in the 
department store who didn't even stop shopping. It was amazing," Rita Smiler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what some Westsiders think, their quakes do not happen at a 
"special angle" that make them more forceful than anyone else's earthquakes. 
However, these do involve a somewhat disturbing phenomenon called "vertical 
thrust," meaning that one side of the fault sort of leaps up and falls on the 
other side of the fault. (Prompting one resident to observe, "It wasn't a 
normal earthquake. It was up and down.") 
</P>
<P>
 Those most unnerved seem to be the recent transplants, but even they adapt 
quite quickly. One waitress who moved from Ohio four months ago was terrified 
on Sunday but by Wednesday found the entire event rather humdrum. 
</P>
<P>
 If some residents find themselves discussing all this in the line at Gelson's, 
however, they must be forgiven. The Westside is in the clutches of a "quake 
swarm," a group of quakes where none is much bigger than the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Santa Monica it is. And despite the deceptively unruffled ambience at 
the sidewalk cafes Wednesday, these people will be just as glad when the whole 
thing ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all sort of hoping it would be the Big One," Brentwood resident Paul 
Levy said. "Drop into the ocean and get it over with." When the Earth Moved The 
Westside has been on the receiving end of a series of small earthquakes 
centered two miles southwest of Santa Monica. No one has been injured, 
officials say.

PARENTS GET TAGGED WITH $38,000 BILL; GRAFFITI: EFFORT TO MAKE COUPLE PAY FOR 
SONS' ACTIONS IS THE FIRST TEST OF AN MTA PROGRAM DESIGNED TO FIGHT A 
$20-MILLION-A-YEAR VANDALISM PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The parents were surprised when their two teen-age sons were arrested on 
suspicion of vandalizing almost two dozen Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
 But not as surprised as when they got the bill from the MTA for $38,000, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really didn't make a comment" when told that they would have to make 
restitution after their sons' arrest Tuesday, said Lt. Tim Murphy of the MTA 
Transit Police. "They were in a state of shock." 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for restitution was the first the MTA has made of parents of 
juveniles who vandalize buses. MTA officials said they are acting under a newly 
adopted program aimed at curbing a $20-million-a-year vandalism problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get the message to parents that they are responsible for the 
behavior, especially criminal behavior, of their kids," said Transit Police 
Chief Sharon Papa. "We want them to know that you can be held accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 But Papa said she is uncertain whether the juveniles' parents, who live in a 
graffiti-scarred neighborhood near Downtown, can pay for the damages. The 
parents could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a kind of test case," Papa said. "If the parents can't afford to pay, 
then maybe the judge will add more community service time" as part of the 
youths' punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to squeeze blood from a turnip," Murphy added. "If parents 
get the message that their kids are out of control and that they've got a bill 
over their head because they haven't paid enough attention to them, then we 
think we'll be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 The two juveniles, ages 14 and 16, were arrested Tuesday morning when MTA 
police officers served a search warrant at their home in the 1100 block of 
Angelina Street. The search culminated an investigation launched several weeks 
ago. The boys are being held at Eastlake Juvenile Hall on felony vandalism 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA police believe the two youths are responsible for more than $100,000 in 
damage to as many as 100 buses during the last year, but Murphy said there is 
only enough evidence "to prove without a doubt" that they tagged 22 buses in 
the last six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are believed to have used engraving knives, drill bits and rocks 
wrapped in heavy duty sandpaper to etch gang names and symbols on bus windows 
and metal surfaces, which officials say is a more serious problem than 
painted-on graffiti. In addition to the engraving tools, police said they found 
several markers and about a dozen cans of paint in the boys' house and an 
adjoining garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe these two are among the most active taggers in Los Angeles County 
as far as buses go," Murphy said, adding that the 16-year-old had paint on his 
hands at the time of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the boys' parents, who are cooperating with police, found it hard to 
believe that their children could be responsible for such destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very adamant about the innocence of their kids," Murphy said. "They 
said their sons were good kids. They were very surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Dieter Hemsing, an MTA maintenance supervisor, said that the two boys began 
targeting buses within the last eight to 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just went nuts on us," he said. "They use our buses for murals and to 
communicate with other gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemsing said gang etchings and engravings on the windows and metal surfaces of 
buses have increased dramatically over the last year, in part, officials 
believe, because of the MTA's aggressive removal of painted graffiti. Etching, 
he said, is far more costly to remove. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs $200 to replace one window panel," Hemsing said. "The people of Los 
Angeles are paying the bill for it."

ANOTHER RLA CO-CHAIR TO STEP DOWN; URBAN RENEWAL: BERNARD KINSEY WILL HEAD A 
NEW FIRM SEEKING TO SPUR INVESTMENT IN THE INNER CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying he will serve as chairman of a new firm that will seek to attract 
private investment to inner-city areas of Los Angeles, Bernard Kinsey announced 
Wednesday that he will step down as co-chair of RLA, effective March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey, 50, follows former Olympics czar Peter Ueberroth and lawyer Barry 
Sanders as co-chairs who have departed from day-to-day leadership of the 
nonprofit organization, which was created as the city's main response to the 
1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA, formerly known as Rebuild L.A., is seeking a single unpaid volunteer to 
replace Kinsey, who earned $150,000 a year, and remaining co-chairs Linda J. 
Wong and Tony Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his appointment shortly after the riots, Kinsey, a former Xerox 
executive, was little known. Since then, he has received both praise and 
criticism as a highly visible spokesman for corporate investment in the 
riot-scarred neighborhoods of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference called by Kinsey at RLA headquarters, he announced that 
he will lead the Urban Development Enterprise Fund, a private real estate 
investment trust that will attempt to provide investment opportunities in 
inner-city shopping centers and other real estate ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I simply plan to take my vision to a different level," said Kinsey, who added 
that he will continue to speak out on public policy issues involving private 
sector involvement in inner-city neighborhoods. Kinsey declined, however, to 
disclose details of the new venture or the site of its first project. 
</P>
<P>
 In his announcement, Kinsey cited RLA accomplishments that included attracting 
$585 million in "hard-dollar" commitments of corporate investment to inner-city 
neighborhoods, creation of a small-business loan fund and the distribution of 
60 vans to community-based organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the months, critics of RLA and Kinsey, who has been the sole African 
American co-chair, have questioned those figures. For instance, the 
$585-million figure includes the pledged construction of supermarkets as far 
from the heart of the Los Angeles riots as Pomona and Las Vegas. Also, several 
nonprofit organizations that have received vans have criticized RLA for not 
making it clear in press releases that the vehicles had to be returned after 
one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The precise purpose for Bernard Kinsey being there was to make sure that 
African American interests in RLA were strongly upheld. Unfortunately he was 
never able to accomplish that," Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas 
said Wednesday. "In the last several months he has largely been trying to beef 
up his own personal press and making the transition to his next job, which he 
is obviously doing now. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what community benefits can be identified is hard to answer," said 
Ridley-Thomas, an RLA board member who has become increasingly critical of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Invited guests at the news conference included Ueberroth and the Rev. Cecil 
Murray of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, both of whom praised 
RLA and Kinsey's service to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has he been perfect? Hell, no," said Ueberroth. "But those who have can 
stand." No one did. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterwards, Ueberroth, asked to identify Kinsey's biggest accomplishment at 
RLA, paused more than 10 seconds to reflect and then replied, "One of them is 
his emergence as a leader and a new voice for change in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey said his new venture will not conflict with his ongoing 
responsibilities at RLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the directors of the Enterprise Fund are Mark T. Burger and Wesley 
Buford of Pacific Development Partners, which has redeveloped a shopping center 
at Rosecrans and Central avenues in Compton since the riots and has developed 
shopping centers in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Other directors of the new real estate investment trust include Richard 
Peiser, a USC planning school professor, and Ron Burkle, chief executive 
officer of Food 4 Less, which RLA says has pledged $40 million in new post-riot 
investment in inner-city neighborhoods.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; 60 STUDENTS 
WALK OUT TO PROTEST DRESS CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chanting "No dress code!" about 60 Burbank High School students staged a 
walkout Wednesday to protest a new school district ban on gang-related attire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really did it just so that they would listen to us," said Raquel 
Castaneda, a 16-year-old sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 The students said they were angry that the new code was written and 
implemented without them, being consulted. After walking out of school at 10:15 
a.m., the students had planned to march to Burbank City Hall to voice their 
complaints. There were no arrests, but about half of the students were escorted 
back to school, some in police cars. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators said they fully support the ban, but also respected the 
students' complaints. "They feel that they were left out and it's a legitimate 
concern," said Assistant Principal Gaylene Van Zjill. "We're going to show them 
the way they can adequately air their complaints before the school board and 
the City Council."

<P>
 A yacht exploded Wednesday afternoon at its harbor berth, killing a welder who 
was on board, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-foot Duchess Diane was engulfed by flames about 3:30 p.m. in the 
Cerritos Channel area of the Port of Los Angeles, Coast Guard spokeswoman 
Brenda Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard and Los Angeles Fire Department crews doused the flames in about 
15 minutes, but were unable to prevent the death of one man who was welding in 
the hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said the cause of the blast in the vessel, 
a converted trawler, was under investigation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FRIEDMAN 
TO BACK ROBERTI IN FIGHTING RECALL EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North Hollywood), widely viewed as the 
leading candidate to succeed embattled state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys), says she will wholeheartedly support Roberti's effort to defeat a recall 
drive leveled against him by anti-gun-control activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supporting Sen. Roberti in whatever way I can," Friedman said."He's 
played an incredibly valuable role on the gun-control issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood Democrat said that she would not place her name on a 
recall ballot as a candidate to replace Roberti. If Roberti were recalled in a 
special election -- which could be held as early as April -- his successor 
would be chosen from a list of candidates appearing on the same ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said she would instead wait for the regular election cycle to run for 
Roberti's seat. Because of term limits, Roberti will be leaving office by 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 By waiting, Friedman not only risks raising the ire of the forces lined up 
against Roberti, but also could be put in the position of having to run against 
an incumbent -- whoever wins the recall election.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORWALK; CABLE 
TALK-SHOW HOST CONVICTED OF RAPING GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Downey cable television talk show host was convicted Wednesday of raping a 
13-year-old girl who went to him looking for a job.  
</P>
<P>
 A Norwalk Superior Court jury deliberated for five hours over two days before 
convicting Tito David Valdez Jr., 23, after a trial that lasted less than a 
week.Valdez is to be sentenced Jan. 26 for the rape and molestation of the 
girl, who is now 14, court officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Valdez and his 56-year-old father, Tito David Valdez Sr., face separate 
charges for allegedly trying to hire a hit man to kill the rape victim before 
she could testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the younger Valdez persuaded the girl to sneak out of her 
Pico Rivera home at 11:45 p.m. last April 28 by telling her it was the only 
time he could give an interview for a job on his "Hollywood Haze" cable 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Valdez took the girl to his family's home in Downey and raped her, 
according to prosecutors.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY REJECTS CLAIMS OF 
2 THAT MICHAEL JACKSON STOLE SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entertainer Michael Jackson did not steal his hits "Thriller," "The Girl Is 
Mine" and "We Are the World" from two songwriters, a federal jury ruled 
Wednesday after just over three hours of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-man, two-woman panel agreed with defense lawyers that the songs bore 
little resemblance to the works of the plaintiffs in the copyright infringement 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plaintiff's case is just not based on evidence. It's based on fantasy," 
lawyer Robert Rothstein had said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynaud Jones and Robert Smith, two childhood neighbors of the Jackson family 
in Gary, Ind., alleged that parts of their songs were pirated for the three 
Jackson hits. Jones asserted that the 1985 African famine relief anthem, "We 
Are the World," was based on his 1977 song, "What Will Become of the Children." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contended that "We Are the World" co-writer Lionel Richie, "Thriller" 
songwriter Rod Temperton and record producer Quincy Jones also lifted part of 
the 1977 demo tape, which had been left with the Jackson family. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson did not attend the three-week trial, but testified in a deposition 
videotaped in Mexico City Nov. 8 and 10 during his "Dangerous" tour. The last 
taping was a day before he quit his international tour, saying he was seeking 
treatment for drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the deposition, Jackson demonstrated his composing technique, although he 
appeared to be drugged as he stumbled over some words. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows in his heart that he didn't write those songs," Jackson said of 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson returned to the United States Dec. 10 and was strip-searched as part 
of a criminal investigation into allegations that he molested a 13-year-old 
boy. No criminal charges have been filed against the singer.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TELLER 
MACHINES PLANNED AT 4 MORE POLICE STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has agreed to install more automated teller 
machines in police stations in an effort to reduce robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers last year established two trial ATMs at police stations in the 
San Fernando Valley and South-Central Los Angeles after the murder of a 
pregnant woman near a Sherman Oaks teller machine. The council voted Tuesday to 
open money machines for the public at the 77th Street, Harbor Division and 
Wilshire Division stations and at the central police facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Credit Union operates the teller machines, which are 
linked by computer with a variety of financial institutions. The Credit Union 
plans to open as many as 26 additional ATMs in police facilities.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY TO 
PAY $1.2 MILLION TO SHOOTING VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to pay $1.2 million to a former 
North Hollywood theater manager who was shot and critically wounded after 
police learned about a threat to kill the man but never warned him. 
</P>
<P>
 George Carpenter, 45, suffered facial nerve damage and other physical and 
psychological injuries in the July 4, 1985, shooting, which police believe was 
meant to stop him from testifying about a robbery he had witnessed at the 
theater he managed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police investigation determined that a detective had assured 
Carpenter that the robbery suspect was no threat, but other officers later 
learned that the suspect was soliciting a "contract hit" on him. Carpenter was 
never warned. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued through his attorney, Thomas G. Stolpman, Carpenter said 
he was happy that the City Council approved his award and has promised to 
review the policy for warning crime witnesses about similar threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is finally doing what I have always wanted -- taking positive action 
to prevent other victims from being injured like I was," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; NANCY 
REAGAN, FOUNDATION JOIN IN ANTI-DRUG EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Reagan and the Best Foundation have joined forces in an expanded 
anti-drug program funded in part by a $1-million grant from the Nancy Reagan 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that our new partnership will play an important role in the 
fight against drug abuse," the former first lady said in a statement issued 
Wednesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the Best name suggests, we will 'Bring Everybody's Strength Together' and 
go head-to-head against this problem that continues to plague America," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will broaden the reach of the Los Angeles-based Best Foundation's 
video-based drug abuse prevention education programs to community-based youth 
organizations. The Best Foundation has provided low-cost or free drug 
prevention in all 50 states and 10 Canadian provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nancy Reagan Foundation, which began operation in January, 1989, has 
awarded more than $5.3 million to drug prevention and education organizations.

RIORDAN, BURKE TO SEEK AID FOR ANTI-GANG PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of a powerful South-Central Los Angeles community group found they 
had friends in high places Wednesday night when Mayor Richard Riordan and 
County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said they would do their best to 
provide more money for a controversial anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
 Their promises to boost city and county funding for the new Hope in Youth 
program came during a standing-room-only meeting of the Southern California 
Organizing Committee at the Phillips Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was called to press the committee's demands not only for more 
money for the program but also for local government officials' help in getting 
a bottling plant to open in South-Central, bringing a supermarket to the 
community and organizing a jobs summit for the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's and Burke's enthusiastic agreement to push the organization's agenda 
brought vigorous cheers and applause from the group, whose confrontational 
techniques often have put political leaders on the hot seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Burke pointed out, coming through with the promised additional funds 
for Hope in Youth may not be easy. Both the city and the county are struggling 
with budget deficits spawned by the state's continuing economic problems.

POLICE GET THEIR MAN -- AND THEIR DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a brazen crime, police said, carried out in broad daylight by a 
confident crook who nonchalantly told Henri Kemp that he would never see his 
beloved Maude again unless he followed instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 A textbook dognaping, in other words.And the life of Maude, a 7-year-old 
Boston terrier, hung in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began on Tuesday when Kemp's wife was listening to messages on the 
answering machine in their Woodland Hills home. Among them was one saying Maude 
had been stolen -- and would be returned only if a $500 ransom were paid. The 
dog apparently had been taken from the couple's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed, Kemp contacted Los Angeles police, who advised him arrange a public 
meeting with the dognaper. The thief called again about 9 p.m., and a meeting 
was set up the next morning in the parking lot of a nearby Ralphs grocery 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the thief asked for the original amount over the phone, Kemp 
eventually talked him down to $450 for Maude's return. 
</P>
<P>
 But unknown to the thief, a trap was being set. Police would stake out the 
Ralphs and move in when Kemp gave them a signal by scratching the back of his 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 When the owner arrived at the supermarket, the thief was waiting. He beckoned 
Kemp to his car to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, watching from afar, a team of 15 uniformed officers moved in and 
arrested Damani Grey, 19, of Northridge on suspicion of extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 After the arrest, Maude bounded out of the suspect's car and ran to Kemp. Safe 
at last.

BLACKS-ONLY CAMPUS EVENT DRAWS FIRE; EDUCATION: CLEVELAND HIGH CONFERENCE IS 
INTENDED TO FOSTER ACADEMIC SUCCESS. BUT CRITICS SAY IT COULD LEAD TO RACIAL 
TENSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 African American students at Cleveland High School are being invited to a 
conference aimed at encouraging them to be more academically successful, but 
the event is being criticized for excluding students of other races. 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsors of the Jan. 20 event acknowledge that they are excluding other 
students, but they say the criticism is unwarranted because the conference is 
intended to discuss ways African Americans at the school can be better 
students, academically and socially. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing this knowing it could be controversial and ready to face the 
criticism, but also knowing and thinking I'm right to do it," said Donna Hill, 
a teacher and one of the sponsors of the conference. "To me it would be a 
different conference if everyone came." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said she wanted the event to be open only to African American students 
because they might feel more secure in such an environment and because an 
integrated meeting could stifle discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 African American students, including those at a magnet school on 
campus, will be sent invitations this week and the school's faculty will be 
sent memos explaining that the two-hour conference is intended to motivate 
those students. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers, students and district officials, however, say the event is 
exclusionary and could lead to racial tensions on campus. They say the meeting 
should be open to all students who wish to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very ill-conceived," said Marty Kravchak, a teacher and 
journalism adviser at the school. "We have excellent cross-cultural friendships 
on this campus. I don't know what this assembly will do to those relationships. 
It's scary." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they are concerned about the event and that, though it 
is not illegal, it is not common district practice to restrict an event to just 
one group of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope the school community would get together and make some other 
decisions," said Board of Education President Leticia Quezada. "In the final 
analysis, others (students) who might be interested should be allowed to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district as a public school system cannot be exclusive," Quezada said. 
"But we do have to compromise sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Others active in multicultural education say the criticism is largely the 
result of the sensitivity felt by many ethnic groups in Los Angeles and that 
even a positive event could come under attack for not being inclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sign that everyone is feeling alienated," said Kenyon Chan, chairman 
of the Asian American studies department at Cal State Northridge. "Non-minority 
people get threatened when minority people talk among themselves. . . . I don't 
think this is meant to plot or scheme against people. It's meant to help people 
gain support and deal with the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Principal Ida Mae Windham said the event was proposed by three 
teachers involved in the Brothers and Sisters United club, which is made up of 
African American students. She said that the event is considered a conference, 
rather than a schoolwide assembly and that she does not believe it will lead to 
racial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really something that is more instructional as opposed to 
entertainment," Windham said. "It was a concerted effort on the part of these 
teachers to bring these kids together. If there is exclusivity, it's because of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The school has about 1,750 students, of whom about 12% are African Americans, 
57% are Latinos and 19% are white. African American students hold about half of 
the 32 student leadership positions on campus, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District hold annual assemblies 
for such things as African American History Month and Hispanic Heritage Month. 
Several of those events at schools across the district have resulted in racial 
problems, ranging from jeering and heckling to serious brawls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland High event, however, is being billed as a conference to 
encourage African American students to fill positive roles in the school. A 
slide show about Cleveland's student activities will be presented and a teacher 
will discuss ways African American students can take a more active and positive 
role on campus, Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, juniors and seniors will be asked to become mentors for incoming 
African American students and seniors will be given awards for attendance and 
achievement, Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 students will be invited to the Jan. 20 event. They will be taken 
out of their regular classes -- with their teachers' permission -- to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Schwartz, a Cleveland science teacher and teachers union representative, 
said he feels uneasy about the event. But he said he does not believe it will 
inflame tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something I'd like to see happening . . . (but) I don't think it's 
going to help or hurt whatever problems we have on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Pupo, a sponsor of the Latino Club at Cleveland, said she believes it is 
often necessary for minority groups to hold meetings to discuss specific 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's necessary -- definitely," Pupo said. The African American 
students "need to feel comfortable and they need to know they can have 
important roles here and in the community."

FRAUD ALLEGED IN TROUBLED SALE OF 2 HOSPITALS; HEALTH CARE: FIRM IS ACCUSED IN 
BANKRUPTCY CASE OF INFLATING PRICE OF TWO FACILITIES IT SOLD TO A COMPANY THAT 
LATER DEFAULTED ON A STATE-INSURED LOAN. SALE MAY COST TAXPAYERS $167 MILLION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials have alleged fraud in the sale of two San Fernando Valley 
hospitals to a company that later defaulted on a state-insured loan, 
potentially saddling California taxpayers with the $167-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusation is contained in a claim filed this week in the bankruptcy case 
of Nu-Med Inc. in federal court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The state alleges that Nu-Med inflated the price of the two hospitals when it 
sold them to Triad Healthcare Inc. In late 1990, when Triad was negotiating for 
a loan guarantee from the state's Cal-Mortgage program, three of the company's 
executives were also top executives of Nu-Med. 
</P>
<P>
 "These key management personnel, serving a dual role as high ranking officers 
of both Nu-Med and Triad, apparently caused Nu-Med to supply financial 
information and assumptions that were used by consultants engaged by such 
management personnel to support the apparently inflated value assigned to the 
assets," the state asserts in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim alleges fraud and misrepresentation by Nu-Med. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad officials said the state's action took them by surprise. In a statement 
Wednesday, Triad Chairman Sanford Weiss said he recently was assured by the 
director of Cal-Mortgage, Dennis Fenwick, that there was no evidence of "any 
wrongdoing in connection with the transaction." Fenwick could not be reached 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also denied that Triad representatives, including those who also 
served as Nu-Med officers, supplied misleading information about the true value 
of the hospitals. "At no time did any representative of Triad attempt to 
influence determination of fair market value of the assets," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nu-Med officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, the Assembly Health Committee has scheduled a Jan. 18 
hearing to examine "conflict of interest issues that were raised by the loan 
guarantee for Triad Healthcare," a committee spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those called to testify are David Werdegar, director of Cal-Mortgage's 
parent agency, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD); 
Larry Meeks, OSHPD's director at the time Triad's loan guarantee was approved; 
Stuart Marylander, who was president of Triad and vice chairman of Nu-Med 
during the negotiations, and Vincent Forte, a member of Cal-Mortgage's advisory 
loan committee at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Forte abstained from voting and acted as Triad's broker in the deal. At the 
time, Cal-Mortgage had no policy prohibiting loan committee members from 
representing applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Forte, a vice president of the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs and Co., 
has resigned from the Cal-Mortgage loan committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Marylander, who is no longer an executive with Triad or Nu-Med, declined 
through a spokeswoman to comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Triad default raises very troubling questions about the Cal-Mortgage loan 
process," Committee Chairman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) said Wednesday 
through a spokeswoman. "It's a financial disaster that the state can 
ill-afford. The focus of this investigation will be how this loan guarantee 
ever won state approval given the apparent conflict of interest that existed." 
The spokeswoman said Margolin was referring to relationships between members of 
the advisory loan committee and Triad officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Triad loan was the largest ever guaranteed by the 25-year-old Cal-Mortgage 
program. Its default last July forced state officials to suspend the 
Cal-Mortgage program, which many nonprofit health care organizations have 
relied upon to obtain low-interest construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The default also jeopardizes the future of the two hospitals Triad bought with 
the loan proceeds, Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center in Sherman Oaks, and 
West Valley Hospital and Health Center in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 If Triad is unable to resume loan payments, a Cal-Mortgage loan guarantee 
requires the state treasury to cover the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-Mortgage officials appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson have been critical of the 
Triad deal, which was approved in the waning days of the George Deukmejian 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported last month that the advisory loan committee recommended and 
Meeks approved Triad's loan guarantee despite warnings from a Cal-Mortgage 
staff analyst that the relationship between Triad and Nu-Med did not appear to 
be "arm's length" and that the actual value of the two hospitals was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenwick said the bankruptcy court action is necessary to protect the state's 
financial interests as Triad's largest creditor.

VICTIM LOSES LAWSUIT OVER LAPD HANDLING OF ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Glendale judge ruled Wednesday that the city of Los Angeles is not liable 
for alleged damages suffered by a former McDonald's manager who was held inside 
the Sunland restaurant by robbers while surveillance officers watched for more 
than 30 minutes from outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Stoll ruled that the law exempts the police 
officers from liability in the incident and issued a directed verdict in favor 
of the city, Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbin L. Cox, 26, of Pasadena alleged in a lawsuit that the Police 
Department's Special Investigations Section should have stopped four men from 
breaking into the restaurant on Foothill Boulevard on Feb. 11, 1990, or, 
failing that, tried to stop the robbery in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 SIS officers had identified the four men as career criminals and were 
following them at the time of the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 When she saw the men attempting to break in, Cox called 911 and was told a 
police car would be dispatched. However, the leader of the 22-man undercover 
surveillance team watching the men called off the response by uniformed 
officers. He then ordered his men to wait until the four robbers emerged from 
the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 While the officers waited, the robbers blindfolded Cox and threatened to kill 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 As they attempted to leave the restaurant, three of the robbers were fatally 
shot by officers and a fourth was wounded and captured. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in a federal lawsuit awarded the surviving robber, who is serving a 
17-year prison sentence for the incident, and members of the dead men's 
families a total of $44,000 on the grounds that members of the SIS team acted 
without cause when they opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the FBI is continuing to investigate possible federal civil 
rights violations in the shooting, an FBI spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox alleged in the suit that the police had a duty to come to her aid after 
she called 911. The LAPD investigation of the incident concluded that the SIS 
team leader, Detective Brian Davis, learned of the 911 call only three minutes 
before the men got inside the restaurant and decided not to rush in immediately 
because not all of the robbers could be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony Wednesday, former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates 
conceded that Cox had reason to expect a police response, but defended Davis' 
judgment. He said that rushing the four robbers inside the restaurant could 
have set off shooting that would have increased the danger to Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox's attorney, Christopher Hiddleson, said his client is considering whether 
to appeal.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: CHAPMAN'S CURREY UPBEAT ON CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman Athletic Director Dave Currey returned from San Antonio on Wednesday 
feeling upbeat about the university's new NCAA Division III status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really pleased with the way Chapman University was accepted by the 
division afterward," Currey said. "There was a tremendous congratulatory 
feeling from members, not just locally from California schools, but from 
throughout the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday at the NCAA convention, Currey and Chapman President James L. Doti 
gave a presentation to the presidents of Division III institutions, who then 
approved the university's switch from Division II and Division I baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, in its first school year without any players on athletic scholarship, 
received a waiver to be admitted in the fall. Usually, the NCAA requires two 
years of Division III compliance before a school is admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Currey said members were impressed with Chapman's preparation and the presence 
of the university's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a tremendous lift for our cause, because when a CEO takes the time 
to get behind something, it shows commitment," Currey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for the program is another application to the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, which turned down Chapman last 
spring, suggesting it apply again in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Next fall, Chapman will compete as a Division III independent and Currey said 
he is happiest for coaches and players who will again have a shot at national 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, we can compete for national championships," Currey said. "I don't 
know if we'll get them, but at least that golden egg is in front of us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman men's basketball Coach Mike Bokosky said he and assistant Terry Boesel 
are becoming comfortable with what it takes to win at the Division III level. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've learned what we have to do recruiting-wise, coaching-wise and 
preparation-wise to compete of this level," Bokosky said. 
</P>
<P>
 After 13 games, the Panthers are 8-5 and 7-4 against Division III teams. They 
are 5-3 against SCIAC teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Solid numbers -- it's the most games Chapman has won since it won 12 in 
1990-91 -- but not dominant. Tuesday, UC San Diego, for years the strongest 
Division III program in the West, showed Chapman how far it has to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons won, 77-61, avenging a 81-68 loss to the Panthers earlier this 
season. Bokosky said San Diego has improved significantly since the last time 
the teams played. He said Chapman has problems with teams that have larger 
players, because other than 6-foot-8 forward Stefan Mumaw, the Panthers don't 
start a player taller than 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give up a whole lot because of that," he said. "But I think our guys are 
able to compete and win games, despite the height and bulk disparity." 
</P>
<P>
 Next up Friday at the Hutton Center, UC Santa Cruz, another bulky team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia's Gitte Mejer was named the Golden State Athletic Conference women's 
player of the week after helping the Eagles to victories against Harding and 
Evangel. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer, a 6-2 senior center from Aarhus, Denmark, had 29 points against Harding 
and 33 against Evangel. She also averaged 11 rebounds and made 24 of 30 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer is leading the conference in scoring average (20.0) and field-goal 
percentage (59.9%). Tuesday she scored 26 in a 75-69 loss at Fresno Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California College women's team extended its winning streak to 11 
games by soundly beating Azusa Pacific, picked to finish second in the 
preseason coaches' poll, 71-48, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards (13-3, 1-0) did it without Emily Wedel, who led the conference 
in three-point field-goal percentage (46.9%) during the pre-conference season 
but has dropped out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the Vanguards, another outside threat, Erin Hartigan, will be 
eligible to play Saturday at Cal Baptist. Hartigan, an all-state guard from 
Utah, transferred from Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The SCC women's basketball team is ranked second in the NAIA in scoring 
defense. Entering Tuesday's game, the Vanguards had allowed 49.4 points a game, 
just behind William Carey (Miss.).

PREP NOTES: CORONA DEL MAR FOOTBALL COACH HOLLAND QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Holland, Corona del Mar football coach for 20 years, has resigned to be 
defensive coordinator at Grossmont College in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great time and career at Corona del Mar," Holland said."But I figured 
if I ever was to make a move upward, it would have to be now."  
</P>
<P>
 Holland, 58, was California's coach of the year in 1989, after the Sea Kings 
won their second consecutive Southern Section Division VI championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland's teams were 106-92-10 and won three league titles during his tenures 
from 1967 to 1975 and 1983-93. The 1988 team is the only undefeated varsity 
football team in the history of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar was 7-4 this season, runner-up in the Sea View League, and lost 
to Villa Park in the first round of the Division VI playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 At Grossmont, Holland will serve under Coach Dave Jordan, a former assistant 
within the Corona del Mar program. Grossmont was voted the national champion 
community college football team last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Myron Miller, athletic director and football coach at Costa Mesa High, also 
will be the school's wrestling coach the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 He replaced Fred Morgan, a campus security guard whose work schedule 
conflicted with the sixth-period class that athletes schedule at the end of the 
school day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Nelson, the Canyon High School senior who won her fourth Century League 
cross-country championship and the Southern Section Division II-AA title last 
season, has signed a letter of intent to attend Brigham Young.

CARLTON GETS TOP HONOR; BASEBALL: HE IS VOTED INTO HALL OF FAME ON FIRST TRY 
WHILE SUTTON MISSES BY WIDE MARGIN. CEPEDA BARELY FALLS SHORT IN LAST YEAR OF 
ELIGIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Carlton, the only pitcher to win four Cy Young awards, was 
overwhelmingly elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility 
while Don Sutton, the former Dodger and Angel pitcher who also won more than 
300 games and was eligible for the first time, missed by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
 In results announced Wednesday, Carlton became the 25th player elected on his 
first try. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton received 436 of 455 votes by members of the Baseball Writers Assn. of 
America for 95.8%, the fifth-highest percentage in history. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes 75% to be elected, which equated to 342 votes in this balloting, and 
only Carlton, 329-244 in his 24-year career, made it. 
</P>
<P>
 The big loser was Orlando Cepeda, who in his 15th and last year on the ballot, 
narrowly missed. He needed seven more votes, finishing at 73.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton, who had only five fewer victories than Carlton -- he was 324-256 -- 
while pitching one fewer season, received 259 votes. Knuckleballer Phil Niekro, 
who also surpassed the 300-victory milestone, received 273 votes in his second 
year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conference call, Cepeda said it was heartbreaking to have come so close, 
"like losing a 1-0 game." He added, however, it was also a victory in that so 
many people rallied behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I was as good as anybody who played," he said. "I know I belong (in 
the Hall), and we did everything we could to convince people." 
</P>
<P>
 After getting only 59.6% of the votes last year, a letter-writing campaign on 
Cepeda's behalf by the San Francisco Giants and several Hispanic members of 
Congress clearly had an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite solid credentials and extensive community work for the Giants, 
Cepeda apparently continued to pay a price with some voters for his 1975 
conviction and jail sentence for smuggling marijuana into Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a mistake 20 years ago," Cepeda said. "Since then I've done so many 
wonderful things for the community and myself. Too many writers today are 
looking for things other than what a player does on the field. Too many writers 
today don't know what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 18 retired players who hit more than 300 home runs and batted over 
.295, only Cepeda is not in the Hall, and he must now hope that the veterans 
committee honors his credentials when he becomes eligible for consideration by 
that group in three years. He said his chances should improve since several 
former players are on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to be elected by the writers because that's the way it is 
normally done, but it would mean as much to me (to be selected by the veterans) 
because I just want to get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton, who spent 16 years with the Dodgers and more than two with the Angels, 
won 20 or more games only once, but had 17 or more victories in five other 
seasons. He ranks fifth on the all-time strikeout list and had a career 
earned-run average only a shade behind Carlton's -- 3.22 to 3.26. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released by his agent, Sutton said he was disappointed but 
added that Niekro's first-year failure had prepared him for the fact that 300 
victories no longer mean automatic election. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad often told me that all you can do is give your best on the field," 
Sutton said. "The rest is out of your control." 
</P>
<P>
 Niekro, whose percentage dipped slightly from his first year on the ballot, 
had a tough time fathoming it. "Like I said last year, you'd think 318 wins 
would be enough," he said. "I just don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton is ninth on the all-time victory list -- second among left-handers to 
Warren Spahn's 363 -- and second in strikeouts with 4,136. He spent 14-plus 
seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies, winning 23 or more games four times, 
including 27 of the 1972 team's total of 59 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton, who lives on a 400-acre ranch in Durango, Colo., did not talk to 
reporters during most of his career, but he will attend a news conference in 
New York today. 
</P>
<P>
 He also released a statement through the Phillies on Wednesday in which he 
said he had never put emphasis on individual awards but was touched by his 
election to the Hall and considered it a great honor "to be included among the 
game's greatest players." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Perez, with 263 votes, finished fourth behind Carlton, Cepeda and Niekro. 
Sutton was fifth, followed in the top 10 by former Dodger teammate Steve 
Garvey, 166 votes; Tony Oliva, 158; Ron Santo, 150; Bruce Sutter, 109, and Jim 
Kaat, 98.

NFL PLAYOFFS; WIPING OUT MEMORY OF WIPEOUT; RAIDERS KEEP THEIR THOUGHTS ON THIS 
WEEK, NOT 51-3 LOSS THREE YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The memory is of a jaw, slack. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared to be unhinged for the duration, 3 hours 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Davis might have moved his lips -- no doubt he blinked and breathed -- but 
the recollection etched is that of Mt. Raider Rushmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone cold. The Gape of Wrath. 
</P>
<P>
 What incredible thoughts must have swirled in his cranium that day, Jan. 20, 
1991, as Davis sat, perched and poached, in the Rich Stadium press box at 
Orchard Park, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Was nothing right in the world? 
</P>
<P>
 Three days before 51-3, as Davis' Raiders prepared for the AFC championship 
game against the Buffalo Bills, reporters approached the owner on the team's El 
Segundo practice field with news the United States had launched air strikes 
against Baghdad, marking the start of the Persian Gulf War against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, with a game of such import looming, Davis would have been so 
singularly focused as to not have allowed himself to be undermined by outside 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 You might walk past him midweek and exchange polite banter about the state of 
affairs, to which Davis might respond: "I guess we'll find out in four days," 
the reference always being to game day. 
</P>
<P>
 But, war being war, Davis took the news to heart and shook his head, then 
returned his gaze toward the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis would gather himself in time to have a visiting Buffalo reporter booted 
off the compound. 
</P>
<P>
 The week before 51-3 was surreal, what with bombs bursting in air. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson had played his last football game, although no one knew it at the 
time. He injured his hip in a divisional playoff victory over the Cincinnati 
Bengals the previous Sunday. A creaky relic named Marcus something-or-other 
picked up the slack and rushed for 140 yards in victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Bo boldly predicted his return for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, they would call the hip condition he suffered avascular necrosis and 
get the paper work started on his NFL retirement plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The week of the Buffalo game, however, they were calling Bo questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 No telling what difference an injury-free Bo would have made in 51-3, but 
Davis has always considered his loss incalculable in weighing Raider fortunes. 
Bo, at least, might have spared the Raiders from the worst loss of the Al Davis 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo's hip and the pall of war shrouded game preparations, as did talk of 
security breaches and scud missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders' all-pro guard Steve Wisniewski's brother was a fighter pilot, 
whereabouts unknown in the skies above Baghdad, with a much greater task at 
hand than Steve would have against Bruce Smith and Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, each had respective jobs to do as war and games continued. 
</P>
<P>
 As kickoff to 51-3 neared, there was doubt as to whether television coverage 
of the game would be preempted by the war, as a then-NBC-star-in-the-making, 
Arthur Kent, filed live reports from the Middle East as he ducked incoming 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was beamed back to Los Angeles as scheduled, much to Los Angeles' 
regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Coach Art Shell maintains no team could have beaten the Bills on that 
day. This week he called the game "an aberration." 
</P>
<P>
 Redemption remains an operative word, although that day -- a shot at the Super 
Bowl, a fair amount of dignity -- can never be totally recouped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, on the field, have redeemed themselves to some degree. They have 
already returned a defeat to Buffalo in Buffalo, only last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders who were on the short end three years ago return with a quiet resolve. 
"It will stick with everyone that was involved in the game," fullback Steve 
Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the offensive starters in 51-3 still play for the Raiders, five of the 
11 on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go up there and win, we'll talk about it," receiver Tim Brown says. "If 
we go up there and lose, you'll talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, weather was not a factor in 51-3. Temperature at game time was 
36 degrees with winds of 10 to 15 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills' offense was a factor. The team's hurry-up, no-huddle formation was 
state of the art that season. The key was that it kept opposing defenses from 
making substitutions between plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders found out early. After consecutive Buffalo gains of 12, 14, 15, 
five and nine yards on the opening drive, the Raiders had to call time out 
simply to take inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten timeouts wouldn't have helped. 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers spoke volumes: 387 total yards, 23 first downs. Running back Thurman 
Thomas rushed for 109 yards. Quarterback Jim Kelly completed 14 of 20 passes 
for 247 yards. Receiver James Lofton, a former Raider, had four catches for 95 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills racked up some statistics in the second half, too, but two quarters 
were all that Buffalo needed for disposal. It was 41-3 at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider highlights? Jeff Jaeger's 41-yard field goal and a blocked extra 
point by Scott Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been 52-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders also held the Bills scoreless in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders would blame themselves for seven turnovers committed, among those 
five interceptions thrown by quarterback Jay Schroeder, who had tossed only 
nine in 16 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it have mattered? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills had no trouble moving the ball without aid of Raider charity, 
scoring on their first two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a blur, they drove 75 yards in nine plays to go up 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Raiders answered with their lonely field goal, the Bills sprinted 66 
yards in four plays to go up 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
 They made it 21-3 with 3:09 left in the first quarter when linebacker Darryl 
Talley returned an interception 27 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 They made it 27-3 in the second quarter after taking a punt and driving 57 
yards in 13 plays. 
</P>
<P>
 They made it 34-3 with 3:18 left in the half, driving 80 yards in seven plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the half, an interception set up a Bills' touchdown, and the game 
was history. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be scars. Cornerback Lionel Washington played perhaps the worst 
game of his life and, with tears in his eyes afterward, was man enough to admit 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to learn to let things go," Washington now reflects on the game. 
"Whenever something bad happens, you've got to go find something good out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's assignment that day was Lofton, who scorched him for 113 
receiving yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Untold was that Washington played with a pulled hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing hurt was my first mistake," Washington says. "Going against a guy 
like Lofton wasn't any easier." 
</P>
<P>
 The next off-season, Washington replayed 51-3 a hundred times on his 
videocassette, not for the purposes of torture, but to learn. "I think it made 
me a lot stronger mentally," he says of the game. "I had to bounce back from 
that. I watched the film over and over to where I knew what I was doing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 While 51-3 will always linger, a different Raider team returns to Buffalo this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler is different from Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Brown, circa 1994, is a different Brown. "It makes a difference when you 
get a guy who can get the ball to anyone he wants to," Brown says of Hostetler. 
"There's a whole different confidence level with this team. Jeff has really 
made the difference. If we just go out and get open, we'll get the ball and do 
what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills are ready and rested. The no-huddle has lost some of its luster 
since 51-3 as have the Bills in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Memory loss hasn't been a problem for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay back? The Raiders are hoping for a real jawbreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time was an embarrassment," Brown says. "I think a lot of the guys 
are looking forward to going up there and making up for it."

 Listen! Did you ever look over at a guy and think to yourself, "Boy! I wish I 
had his job"? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he was an emcee at a beauty pageant. Maybe he ran golf tours to Hawaii. 
Maybe he was President. Secretary of State. Ballroom dancer. Donald Trump. 
Social director on the Love Boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Not me. I always envied Jack Lang's job. It has been called "the happiest job 
in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lang calls people up to tell them they're in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that's the next best thing to being Santa Claus. Jack is the 
secretary-treasurer of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America, the organization 
that is the real umpire of the game, the conscience -- and the judge and the 
jury -- of the grand old game in this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 20,000 or more players who played in the big leagues, only a handful 
have made the game's Valhalla -- a little over 200, including umpires, 
managers, commissioners and executives. It's easier for the proverbial camel to 
go through the eye of a needle than for an athlete to get into this kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball writers are the toughest judges in the country. Their Hall of 
Fame is a more exclusive fraternity than the House of Lords. You indeed have to 
be baseball royalty to get in. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, you need 75% of the vote. If the Electoral College had that 
provision, we'd never get a President. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe Joe DiMaggio -- Joe DiMaggio! -- didn't make it his first 
year of eligibility? He came up 14 votes short of admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe 11 voters didn't think Babe Ruth belonged in the Hall of 
Fame? Would you believe 43 didn't believe Mickey Mantle did? Henry Aaron, no 
less, finished up nine votes short of unanimous. At that, he got the highest 
percentage of anyone but Ty Cobb and Tom Seaver. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballplayers are used to calls from the President of the United States, the 
governor of the state, Bob Hope, or other famous athletes at the high moments 
of their careers. But the call they wait for most of the rest of their lives is 
from Jack Lang. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lang is a sunny, cheerful, optimistic man who never ceased to be a 
baseball fan. Sometimes, years in a press box can dim the glamour for a man who 
is hired in part to keep a jaundiced eye on the flaws in the grand old pastime. 
For Jack Lang, it never did. His love of baseball always shone through the 
cynicism of press row. One result is, his BBWAA, of all journalistic trade 
associations, is the most respected -- and the most powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it falls to him to notify our athletic heroes that they have had their 
careers validated by inclusion in the most prestigious shrine of them all. They 
have joined history. Their careers had meaning. His call has become one of the 
most eagerly awaited events in the lives of many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have wept when the Lang call came in. Others have muttered prayers of 
thanks. None have shrugged or growled. The most hard-bitten of cases have been 
softened by inclusion. They have won the Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been my good fortune since 1967 to call every winner of every award 
the BBWAA hands out," Lang recalls. "The Hall of Fame calls were highlights." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Cooperstown call he made was to the great Yankee pitcher, Red 
Ruffing, who was in his last year of eligibility (a player becomes eligible 
five years after his career is over and for 15 years thereafter). "He was so 
nervous, he was out driving around Cleveland in his car. He was afraid to 
know," Lang recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Lang put through one of his most poignant calls. "When I was a kid 
back in Brooklyn in 1935, I remember hanging over a fence one day begging a 
player named Joe (Ducky) Medwick for an autograph. Now, Joe was a kind of surly 
sort in those days, but he grudgingly gave me the autograph. Thirty-three years 
later, I call him up to tell him he made the Hall of Fame!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I never call losers," Lang admits. "I only bring good news." He broke this 
rule only once, he says. The late Roy Campanella, in his first year of 
eligibility, had come up a few ballots short of inclusion. He had asked Lang to 
phone him in any event. "I don't call losers, I hate to disappoint," Lang told 
him. "Call me anyway," Campy instructed. "I did," Lang recalls, "the only loser 
I ever called. Campy said, 'That's OK, Jack. The good Lord will take care of me 
next year." Adds Jack: "He did." 
</P>
<P>
 When Mickey Mantle was called in 1974, his first thought was, "Did Slick make 
it?" Slick was his nickname for his Yankee colleague Whitey Ford. "Yep. You're 
an entry," Lang told him. Mantle and Ford set the Bloody Mary record the 
morning of the press conference, Lang recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 He almost didn't get Ralph Kiner in Ralph's final year for inclusion. "His 
mother-in-law kept his phone tied up for hours. He almost missed the call." 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Mays, believe it or not, missed unanimous selection by 23 votes, Lang 
recalls. (No one has ever gotten in unanimously.) But, when Willie arrived, he 
got even. At the press conference, he was asked who was the greatest player he 
ever saw. "Me," Willie responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang was occasionally robbed of the pleasure of personal notification. When he 
tried to reach Luis Aparicio in 1984, the old White Sox shortstop was 
broadcasting a game in his native Venezuela. "They put me through, not to Luis, 
but to the public-address announcer. He promptly got on the P.A. to announce it 
not only to Luis but the entire ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Jack was hoping to make a call to San Francisco. Like a lot of 
us, he was hoping Orlando Cepeda would get in. "I've voted for him for eight 
years," Lang admitted. "But he missed by seven votes. Since there were 455 
votes cast, it means 120 people didn't vote for him. But, Nellie Fox missed by 
only two votes in his last year and Jim Bunning missed by eight in 1980." So, 
Cepeda became the second-closest call in Hall history. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters did give pitcher Steve Carlton 95.5% of the votes (436). "Steve was 
in Durango, Colorado, waiting to get on a flight to Denver and then New York if 
he made it. Ten minutes before the flight, he phoned up. 'Shall I come?' he 
asks. 'Get here!' we tell him. 'You're in!' " 
</P>
<P>
 While the disappointment for Cepeda was great, Lang defends the Hall's 
standards. "I've never seen a ballot with more good players on it (than this 
year)," he admits. "But you have to remember, the Hall is for great players, 
not good players." 
</P>
<P>
 And when you're great, Lang will be the first to tell you.

SHARKS HAVE THE KEY TO BEATING THE DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe something was lost in the translation. Maybe it was the postgame 
singing. Or perhaps it was because the best spokesman was not immediately 
available for comment because he was watching the end of a hockey game on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, the San Jose Sharks simply couldn't come up with an 
answer to Wednesday night's most pressing question: 
</P>
<P>
 Why do they dominate the Mighty Ducks? 
</P>
<P>
 So, Johan Garpenlov, what gives? 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I don't know," said Garpenlov, a Swede who played on a line with 
Russians Sergei Makarov and Igor Larionov that scored 10 points in a 5-2 
victory over the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe our style fits this team. It's hard to say why. We've played pretty 
good against this team." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was an opening Wednesday, the Sharks found it and took full advantage 
to defeat the Ducks again. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose is 5-0 against the Ducks, hence the singing, but is only 8-21-10 
against the rest of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 There must be something to this one-sided series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I knew," Larionov said. "They (the Ducks) play so well on the road, 
then they come home and don't do so well. There's no answer to why they're 
losing to us." 
</P>
<P>
 What's your opinion, Coach Kevin Constantine? 
</P>
<P>
 He was watching the King game on TV, but later had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ducks are an awfully good team and we have just been fortunate to get a 
lot of wins against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Style and substance probably played as big part in San Jose's victory as 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks and Sharks play a hard-checking, defensive-oriented style and San 
Jose once again seemed to execute the game plan more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Garpenlov had two goals, Larionov had one goal and three assists and Makarov 
had two goals and two assists. Larionov and Makarov tied the team record with 
four points in a game.

WOMAN STABS GERMAN SOCCER PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who can neither hear nor speak stabbed a member of the Hamburg SV 
soccer team Wednesday while he sat in the stands during an indoor tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Moeller, 25, an amateur player under contract with the Bundesliga club 
Hamburg, was rushed to a nearby hospital for surgery.Doctors said the outer 
skin of his liver was damaged, but his injuries are not life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman wielding an eight-inch kitchen knife was overpowered by another 
spectator and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaus Arendt, a police supervisor on duty, said the 28-year-old woman was 
still being questioned. Police did not know the woman's motive and did not 
release her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerhard Meyer-Vorfelder, president of the Stuttgart club, said it would 
"certainly have consequences (on security) at future indoor tournaments," where 
players often sit next to spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was the second stabbing of a sports figure in Germany in less than 
a year. Monica Seles was stabbed in the back in Hamburg on April 30.

CAL STATE FULLERTON'S GORDON SAYS SCHOLARSHIP LIMIT IS NOT RACIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton President Milton Gordon, after returning from the NCAA 
Convention in San Antonio, said Wednesday that he voted against adding another 
men's basketball scholarship and that he does not think the decision to keep 
the limit at 13 was racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not," said Gordon, who is black."I talked with a number of my 
friends (at the convention) about it and the presidents are ultimately 
responsible for budgets. To me, this has nothing to do whatsoever with race. 
It's a cost-containment measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can especially understand it here in California. We've got to consider 
cost and rein it in." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said the vote is part of a cost-containment trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going back over the last three years that I've been president (at Fullerton), 
the presidents as a group have really tried to rein in costs in athletics in 
general. We made a tough decision to bring this about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I supported it at the time and I still support it. I voted against 
(increasing the scholarship total to 14)." 
</P>
<P>
 As for threats that Black Coaches Assn. members will boycott games and, in 
some instances, withhold their players from playing, Gordon said he doesn't 
think it will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is going to occur," Gordon said. Titan Coach Brad Holland 
and assistant Chris Brazier, who is black, both said Fullerton plans to play 
its game at Utah State on Saturday as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "As assistants, our jobs are not going to change, I'll guarantee you that," 
Brazier said. "Even if (Arkansas Coach) Nolan Richardson boycotted, he would 
still have his assistants on the road recruiting." SCOTT MILLER

ANGELS PROMOTE PUBLICIST TIM MEAD, HIRE VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Mead, who originally was hired by Buzzie Bavasi in 1981 to work full time 
in the Angels' public relations department, was promoted Wednesday to assistant 
general manager by Buzzie's son, general manager Bill Bavasi. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity of a lifetime for the only team I've ever wanted to be 
with," Mead, 35, said."Buzzie helped give me my first opportunity, and now for 
his son to give me this chance at the next stage of my life is awfully 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also announced the hiring of Joseph Schirer, 55, who developed and 
cast the original pilot of the "All in the Family" TV Series, as vice 
president/marketing. Other appointments included: Preston Gomez, special 
assistant to the general manger; John Sevano, assistant vice president/media 
relations and broadcasting; Larry Babcock, director baseball information, and 
Kraig Kojian, assistant director baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, Bavasi is expected to resume negotiations today with free-agent 
bullpen stopper Gregg Olson. The Angels have offered a two-year deal that could 
pay Olson nearly $3.5 million in 1994, but Olson also has offers from the 
Toronto Blue Jays and Atlanta Braves. The Philadelphia Phillies and Baltimore 
Orioles are expected to submit offers within a few days. BOB NIGHTENGALE

MILLER'S NUMBER COMING UP AGAIN; BASKETBALL: FORMER TITAN PLAYER, NOW AN 
ASSISTANT COACH AT FULLERTON, WILL HAVE HER NO. 40 RETIRED IN MARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maryalyce Jeremiah had a promise to keep to Genia Miller, which is why there 
were a few awkward moments when the Cal State Fullerton women's basketball team 
started practice in October and freshman Michele Leitner was wearing No. 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremiah, associate athletic director at Fullerton, and Deborah Ayres, in her 
second season as Jeremiah's successor as the Titan coach, were in a meeting 
when Jeremiah casually mentioned that Fullerton was going to retire No. 40 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayres' reaction was quick: Uh-oh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's got that number," Ayres said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, somebody can't wear that number," Jeremiah said. Before they had a 
chance to fix it, the situation was resolved for them. Leitner blew out a knee 
and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 And Miller's No. 40 will be retired at halftime of the Titan men's game 
against UC Santa Barbara on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Two things about Miller, who returned to Fullerton this fall and is in her 
first year as one of Ayres' assistants: She was quite a player; she is almost 
finished with her degree. 
</P>
<P>
 That was her end of the deal with Jeremiah. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me back in 1991 that once I graduated, she would retire my number," 
said Miller, who, in 1991, became Fullerton's first -- and only -- Kodak 
All-American. "I was surprised. I really was. I never put myself on a pedestal. 
It was a great honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeremiah: "She's one of my favorite subjects. She's just come so far. 
When we recruited her out of Crenshaw High School (in Los Angeles), she was so 
shy and she just wasn't very good. She couldn't shoot a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just really felt that if we could teach her some things and put her in the 
post as a freshman . . . The one thing she could do was block shots. She had 
more blocked shots in high school than points. We'd put her in and let her 
block a couple of shots, then take her out, give her a high-five and tell her 
how good she was." 
</P>
<P>
 Really, the fact that the promise to retire her number had been kept so quiet 
was fitting; Miller never was very loud. 
</P>
<P>
 Before her first game as a freshman, Miller quietly approached one of 
Jeremiah's assistants and said she didn't think she was good enough to play at 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 After her sophomore season, she declined Jeremiah's offer to help her get a 
spot playing against national competition at the U.S. Olympic Center in 
Colorado. She still didn't think she was good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though she regularly dunked during pregame warm-up drills, and even 
though Jeremiah told her it would be great if she did it during a game because 
she would be the first woman to accomplish the feat, the one time Miller had a 
golden opportunity, she chose to go for a layup instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was against UC Santa Barbara and she stole the ball and was on a breakaway 
all by herself," Jeremiah recalled. "I was standing up on the sidelines and I 
said, 'This is it!' She made a finger-roll layup instead. And we were ahead by 
15 points! She said, 'Coach, I was just afraid I would miss the shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of her career, Miller, 6 feet 3, became Fullerton's all-time 
leading scorer (2,415 points, 20.5 points per game) and leading rebounder 
(1,162). She also is listed first in the Titan record book under field goals 
made (914, a Big West Conference record), field goals attempted (1,598, also a 
conference record), free throws made (587), free throws attempted (849), 
blocked shots (428, an NCAA record) and blocked shots per game (428, also a 
conference record). 
</P>
<P>
 And they still talk about that night in 1991 when Miller made 10 of 10 
field-goal attempts and all eight free-throw attempts during an NCAA tournament 
victory over Louisiana Tech in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 And this was a kid who couldn't make a free throw when she arrived at 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers that Louisiana Tech game well, and she is proud of the Kodak 
All-American award from 1991 that hangs on the wall in her office. But her 
biggest memory from playing at Fullerton? 
</P>
<P>
 She hems and haws awhile before finally settling on one. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what?" she said. "I have it. It was coming in here as a freshman and 
not being able to shoot a free throw. The ball never even made it to the 
basket. I was pitiful. All I could do was run and block shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "And by my senior year, I was an All-American. The progress I made, and having 
Coach Jeremiah there to help me through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Miller's success doesn't necessarily lie in all of those gaudy 
numbers. No, to see what makes Miller tick, you need only discover why she 
returned to Fullerton this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 She played in Japan the last two seasons -- earning $100,000 two years ago and 
roughly $125,000 last season -- but there was the matter of the unfinished 
degree. Miller has dreamed of opening a day-care center since her freshman year 
in high school, and she always saw basketball as a means to that end. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Opening a day-care center) is something I've wanted to do for a long time," 
Miller said. "Basketball is a stepping stone for me to obtain that goal. It's 
helped me to get where I am now." 
</P>
<P>
 The day-care center Miller envisions will offer educational toys, computers 
and other mind-expanding devices.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to have an educational center, not just a baby-sitting place for 
kids," she said. First, she will finish the two classes needed for her degree 
this semester. After that, she will have to fend off Ayres' plans to coax her 
back for another basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could keep her forever," Ayres said. "She's been very helpful this 
year, particularly at the post position. And, more importantly, having her 
person around -- she's a great person." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Miller's plans to end her coaching career after this season . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I am certainly going to sit down and talk with her about it," Ayres said. "We 
like having her around." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what Miller's association with the Fullerton basketball program, 
that's pretty much been the reaction.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; ANTLEY HOPES MOVE REVIVES RIDING CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are houses with curses, and then there is the three-bedroom house that 
jockey Chris Antley has been renting in Duarte since last fall. No poltergeists 
there. Among the previous occupants are Corey Nakatani and Kent Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that's missing is if (Chris) McCarron lived there before those 
other guys," said Antley, who is not particularly superstitious. 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving on the Southern California circuit in recent years, Nakatani 
and Desormeaux have thrived. Last year, Desormeaux finished second nationally 
with $13.1 million in purses and Nakatani was ninth with $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Antley has been where they've been on the money list, and now he has moved 
from New York to California to revive a career that tailed off badly last year. 
From a high of $8 million in purses in 1991, the year he won the Kentucky Derby 
with Strike The Gold, Antley struggled to reach the $5-million mark in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was the slowest year I've ever had," said Antley, 28, who has 
ridden more than 2,800 winners since he rode his first at Pimlico in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 California, with its hefty purse schedule and chamber-of-commerce weather, 
might look like an oasis, but the palm trees have been mirages for a number of 
top Eastern jockeys over the years, including Steve Cauthen and Jose Santos. 
The current riding colony includes three Hall of Famers -- McCarron, Laffit 
Pincay and Eddie Delahoussaye -- and several younger jockeys who will have 
credentials good enough for enshrinement someday. This is how tough the circuit 
is: Going into this week, two established riders, Pat Valenzuela and Aaron 
Gryder, had won only twice out of 73 mounts at the Santa Anita meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I decided to come out here, I knew there would be two big questions," 
Antley said. "Number one, will I do any better than those other guys (from New 
York) who didn't, and number two, am I in California to stay?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's easier for Antley to address the second question first. He owns two homes 
in New York, one near Belmont Park and the other not far from Saratoga, and 
he's put the one near Belmont up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Antley sidesteps the East-to-West bugaboo will take more time to 
assess, but he has already sneaked up in the local riding standings, which are 
tallied according to total victories rather than money. Arriving in late 
October, Antley didn't win any races during the closing days of the Oak Tree 
meet, finished ninth at Hollywood Park with 14 victories and now at Santa Anita 
he's on a victory-a-day pace for the first 13 days, good for second place in 
the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 For Antley and his agent, Bill Barisoff, more encouraging is that the winners 
have come with horses that were generally overlooked by the betting public. 
Before Wednesday's races, the average victory payoff on an Antley winner was 
more than $25; a flat $2 win bet on all of his mounts at the meet would have 
brought a profit of $176. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'll have to ride a lot of longshots to get established," Antley said. 
"Right after I got here, Bear (Barisoff) would say to me in the mornings, 
'Let's go on another stable tour.' Even though I've been in racing a long time, 
I was surprised at all the trainers that I didn't know. Rodney Rash put me on 
three horses the other day, but I've been getting business from a lot of 
trainers, which is a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his success, Antley's career has been an amalgam of surges and hard 
times. Still a teen-ager in 1985, he won 469 races, leading the nation. He set 
a record in 1987 by riding nine winners, four in the afternoon at Aqueduct and 
five at night at the Meadowlands. In 1989, en route to leading all New York 
jockeys with 234 victories, he won at least one race every day that he rode at 
Aqueduct for 64 consecutive days, which is believed to be a record. And 1991 
brought the acme, with Strike The Gold in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug problems stopped him three times. Antley said that those difficulties 
ended in 1990. Late that year, Antley suffered a broken collarbone when Mr. 
Nickerson apparently suffered a heart attack and went down in the Breeders' Cup 
Sprint at Belmont, and even the Strike The Gold script had a sour ending. 
Antley and the trainer, Nick Zito, were bystanders as three owners fought for 
control of the colt. After finishing sixth in the Preakness, Strike The Gold 
lost by a head to Hansel in the Belmont Stakes, and two months later, by the 
time the horse got to Saratoga for the Travers, Antley was bounced as the 
rider. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of all that stuff going on, that horse got more press than 
Secretariat," Antley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The omens for Antley going west were not encouraging. In three trips to 
California in the last three years, he received stewards' suspensions every 
time, once after the 1991 Santa Anita Handicap and most recently at Del Mar 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, you might say, 'Why would I want to come here?' " Antley said. 
"But those three suspensions were only matters of circumstance. My horses did 
do some bumping. When I got the days at Del Mar, I hung around down there for 
five or six days, since I couldn't ride back in New York, either. I got to know 
some of the people, I got the feel of what it was like to be out here. Two 
weeks after I got back to New York, I made up my mind. Every day's a challenge, 
but I decided to go for the gusto." 
</P>

 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of the 1993 Eclipse Awards will be announced a week from today. . . . 
Saturday is the early deadline for horses to be nominated for the Triple Crown 
races. The fee is $600 per horse. The fee for late nominations, which are due 
by April 2, has been raised from $4,500 to $6,000. The $5-million payoff 
remains for any horse that sweeps the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont 
Stakes, but Chrysler Corp., sponsor of the $1-million bonus that was paid 
annually to the owner of the horse with the highest point total for the races, 
has discontinued that prize. Chrysler will make a donation of $300,000 this 
year to equine-related charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiaran McLaughlin, former agent for Chris Antley in New York and once an 
assistant trainer for the Wayne Lukas Stable, is now training for the Maktoum 
family in Dubai, where the horses have air-conditioning in their stalls. . . . 
Aqueduct officials, having difficulty coordinating five simulcast races from 
Gulfstream Park with their seven-race programs of live racing, have installed 
"quick official." Quick official allows stewards to make races official before 
jockeys weigh in and requires riders to make foul claims before they dismount. 
Quick official is under consideration in California.

OVERTIME PAY SPARKS PROBE OF WESTMINSTER FIRE DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL and BERT ELJERA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating whether 
Westminster firefighters and their superiors fraudulently collected hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in an overtime-pay scheme that has undermined the city's 
effort to streamline the embattled Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 City financial audits, which have been turned over to investigators, show that 
some firefighters have regularly collected $20,000 to $40,000 a year in 
overtime and that department members went on what city leaders call an 
"overtime rampage" shortly after the Westminster City Council passed a 
reorganization plan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 During the so-called binge, firefighters charged up $283,000 in overtime 
during a period from July 1 to Sept. 15, 1993, exhausting the $75,000 reserved 
for such wages in the 1993-94 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for the Westminster Firefighters Assn. on Wednesday strongly 
denied any wrongdoing by department personnel, and one union official said he 
welcomed the investigation to help clear up concerns of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Paul Gilbrook, president of the association, has been placed on 
administrative leave pending the outcome of disciplinary proceedings into 
whether he improperly collected money for sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The audits and the investigation are the latest developments in an already 
strained relationship between city leaders and the firefighters association, 
which supports a recall of the four council members who voted to overhaul the 
fire service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have uncovered a hornet's nest. Other cities are watching how we tame the 
hornets," said Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman, referring to the city's strong 
firefighters union. "We've taken on the big boys. . . . We have evidence 
firefighters falsified time cards, took vacation days and (still) charged for 
cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the firefighters association, which represents everyone on the 
63-member department except the chief, blamed the overtime situation on the 
City Council for failing to approve enough firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members are "engaging in slanderous commentary," said Alan C. Davis, 
an attorney who represented Westminster firefighters last year in a lawsuit 
against the city over layoffs. "This has reached the point that they should be 
held responsible for their conduct. We will take to the D.A. our own 
allegations of criminal slander." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Guy Ormes, who heads the district attorney's unit that 
looks into corruption by public officials, confirmed that an investigation has 
been underway for almost two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ormes declined to elaborate on the breadth of the allegations, except to say 
that some of it relates to overtime charges by firefighters. He said he did not 
know when the investigation would be finished. But sources said the district 
attorney's office is looking into whether there is a broad conspiracy to 
defraud the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city made a formal complaint to the district attorney's office several 
months ago after financial audits by the accounting firm of KMPG Peat Marwick 
revealed large amounts of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation and the district attorney's investigation were revealed Tuesday 
evening during Mayor Charles V. Smith's state-of-Westminster address before the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they audited about $4 million in overtime payments since 
1986 after an initial accounting revealed that some firefighters, including 
several high-ranking ones, have been paid tens of thousands of dollars in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Wednesday that the city has uncovered cases of firefighters 
receiving overtime for hours not worked or receiving overtime for shifts that 
were worked by other people. City officials also say that some firefighters 
improperly received cash payments for vacation time and sick time that were 
actually used. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how many department members are involved or how much fraudulent 
overtime was allegedly paid, but a number of firefighters are facing potential 
disciplinary action by the city, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of these guys are probably honest, hard-working firefighters and 
paramedics," Smith said. "How many are involved, though, I just don't know. My 
feeling is that it will be a relatively small proportion of the department." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, the firefighters' attorney, said the city is charging Gilbrook, the 
head of the firefighters union, with allegedly receiving more money in sick pay 
than he was entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. was scheduled to conduct hearings today and 
Friday in the Gilbrook case, but the hearings have been canceled, Davis said. 
Gilbrook has been on administrative leave since Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial suspicions about overtime charges were raised when city auditors 
disclosed that about $1 million in overtime was paid in fiscal year 1991-92, 
when the budget for overtime was about $710,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In that year alone, a battalion chief made more than $33,416 in overtime, 
while the department's other three battalion chiefs averaged about $22,000 in 
overtime wages, auditors found. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city's Personnel Department, the annual salary for 
firefighters is about $44,800. Fire truck engineers make $52,400. Paramedics 
earn about $56,000. Captains are paid roughly $60,000, while battalion chiefs 
make at least $75,000. Salaries can be higher or lower depending on experience, 
cost-of-living raises and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The audits showed that the average captain's salary plus overtime came to just 
more than $83,000 in 1992. Some paramedics received more than $22,000 in 
overtime in addition to their average salary of $61,000 a year. One paramedic 
charged for more than $40,000 in overtime pay for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the overtime situation grew more acute shortly after the council 
passed a Fire Department reorganization plan for fiscal year 1993-94 to 
streamline operations and to almost eliminate overtime payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The overhaul took a ladder truck out of service, implemented the paramedic 
service at one station, eliminated six positions and used floaters to reduce 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 But from July 1 to Sept. 15, 1993, Smith said, firefighters went on an 
"overtime rampage." 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, the firefighters had sued the city over the reorganization 
plan and obtained a temporary restraining order that was lifted in September. 
The lawsuit is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "In just a few weeks, they spent almost four times their annual overtime 
budget. They have been spending (taxpayer) money at a rate of over $2,500 in 
overtime per day since the beginning of the fiscal year," Smith said Wednesday. 
"This will bankrupt the city if allowed to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Richard Jones said a preliminary review of the audit indicates 
possible violations of employment policies that could result in reprimands to 
termination for some firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were getting paid for not working," Jones said. "That's the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 At the city's firehouses Wednesday, firefighters were hesitant to talk about 
the investigation, but the continuing conflict with the City Council, they say, 
is taking a heavy toll on morale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you I'm very anxious for this thing to get done," said Capt. Craig 
Campbell, the department's training officer. "Whenever an organization gets 
this media attention, it tends to get morale down, and we want to get on with 
our lives and do our jobs as firefighters." 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders and critics of the department say the current investigation into 
overtime practices is symptomatic of a department that has had difficulties for 
years and has repeatedly tried to thwart council efforts to improve operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason our relationship has been strained is because we are getting close 
to what has been going on and they do not like it," Smith said. "The 
firefighters union has gotten very defensive and they want us out of office. 
They knew we would not tolerate what is going on in the department." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say some of the difficulties with the Fire Department began in 
April, 1990, when firefighters undermined city efforts to improve paramedic 
response time on the west side of town and bring it up to county standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan called for paramedic service to be added to Fire Station 3. A new 
ambulance van was purchased and six firefighters retrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the City Council did not learn until early 1993 that firefighters 
took paramedic equipment off the fire-paramedic engine in Station 2 on the east 
side of town and placed the new paramedic van in service at that firehouse 
instead of Station 3. Station 2 was the firefighters union headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time we had insufficient paramedic service and too many firefighters," 
Smith said. "Most of our calls are for paramedics, but they fought us every 
step of the way on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Fire Chief D'Wayne Scott, a 26-year-veteran of the department, was 
fired in February for disloyalty to the city, a lack of good judgment and 
failures to assume a high standard of conduct. City officials cited instances 
of drunken behavior, chronic absenteeism, and the chief's refusal to send 
firefighters to the Los Angeles riots in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who has sued the city for wrongful termination in Superior Court, 
maintains that he has done nothing wrong and that the allegations are false. He 
says he did not want to send firefighters to Los Angeles because he considered 
it unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of this stuff has been building up for a while," Smith said. "In the 
case of Scott, a lot came out during that episode. I expect that more things 
will come out as we get deeper and deeper into this. This is a long way from 
being over." 
</P>
<P>
 After the City Council passed the reorganization plan on a 4-1 vote, a 
petition drive was launched to recall council members Smith, Bohman, Tony Lam 
and Craig Schweisinger, but not Councilman Frank Fry Jr. The firefighters union 
and its backers support the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garrison, a director of the firefighters association, said Wednesday that 
the four City Council members are just trying to retaliate for the recall 
attempt. He welcomes the investigation, he said, and predicted the firefighters 
will be vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful, it's great," Garrison said. "From the very start, we have 
maintained that nobody has done anything improper or illegal. It will come out 
that we have done nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the recall have until Feb. 19 to gather the 6,937 signatures 
necessary to qualify the measure for the ballot. So far, they say, they have 
gathered more than 4,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the Fire Department is not being singled out or that the 
request for an investigation was done in retaliation for the recall drive 
organized by supporters of the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, Smith said, was started months before the firefighters and their 
supporters circulated the recall petition. "No matter what we do, the 
firefighters will always say that we're doing it in retribution. But facts are 
facts," he said. Overtime May Be Overboard 
</P>
<P>
 City audits of the Westminster Fire Department have revealed dramatic overtime 
charges, which are now the subject of a criminal investigation by the district 
attorney's office. During the first 10 weeks of the current fiscal year, the 
department paid nearly $300,000 in overtime charges: 03,09,24,21 Overtime hours 
charged Total overtime paid 1986-87 18,769 $341,671 1987-88 23,891 $507,405

BLACKS URGE U.S. PROBE OF O.C. DEPUTY'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Frustrated by the state's refusal to intervene in a simmering controversy, 
black leaders in Orange County called Wednesday for a federal investigation 
into possible civil-rights violations in the Christmas Day shooting of a local 
sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to keep going with this," said Randall Jordan, a minister and 
publisher in Orange County who met with the undersheriff last week to discuss 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is anger in the African American community over the death of Deputy 
(Darryn Leroy) Robins," Jordan said. "A black officer was killed by a white 
officer, and some people do have feelings that there was some foul play here. . 
. . Deputy Robins was one of our own." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities at the U. S. attorney's office said they would look at the request 
and determine whether a federal investigation is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, 30, was fatally shot in the face by fellow Deputy Brian Scanlan around 
2 p.m. Dec. 25 while they were reportedly running through an informal training 
drill at a parking lot behind a Lake Forest movie theater. He is survived by a 
wife and 17-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office assumed control of the investigation at the 
outset and is seeking to determine whether any criminal charges should be filed 
against Scanlan, 32, because of the shooting. The investigation, already 
underway for more than 2 1/2 weeks, is expected to continue through month's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Black leaders acknowledge that no evidence of a racial motive has surfaced in 
what authorities describe as an accidental shooting. And they say they have 
seen no sign of wrongdoing or incompetence by the district attorney's office, 
which investigates all officer-involved shootings under a county policy 
established in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, these leaders say, they have been bothered by what they describe as a 
gnawing concern that the full story about the shooting may never come out. This 
concern has centered on the close daily working relationship between the 
Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office, both of which are part 
of the county government structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception is that this is a very questionable arrangement at best," said 
Eugene Wheeler, a health administrator who is president of a civic and 
professional group called 100 Black Men of Orange County. Wheeler accompanied 
Jordan to last week's meeting with Undersheriff Raul Ramos, who was told of the 
black leaders' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, publisher of the Black Orange monthly magazine, said the idea of the 
district attorney investigating the Sheriff's Department "is like one sister 
telling her mother on the other sister." 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials say they see no conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the shooting, Sheriff Brad Gates and his department have come under 
increasing criticism from community leaders, who have questioned why the 
deputies were training in a public site with loaded weapons and why the 
department was so slow to release information on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to mollify critics in the black community, Gates asked the state 
attorney general's office earlier this week to conduct an independent 
investigation into the case. But state officials turned down the request, 
saying that they might later review the findings of the district attorney's 
office once its investigation is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Black leaders, who forged an informal coalition of more than a dozen Orange 
County civic, religious and business groups to press the Robins case, suggested 
Wednesday that the maneuvering over the state investigation may not have helped 
Gates' standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said he believes Gates was "sincere" in his efforts, but he 
acknowledged that some black leaders think the sheriff may have been merely 
politicking when he made his unusual request for a state investigation. It was 
turned down within hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people believe (Gates' request) was a three-card monte game . . . a kind 
of sleight of hand -- now you see it, now you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lt. Dan Martini, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, characterized 
such claims as "unwarranted speculation. . . . The sheriff gave it a very 
good-faith effort in response to a community request." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the attorney general has turned Gates down, Martini said, the sheriff 
does not appear likely to join the call for a federal investigation. "At this 
point, the attitude of the sheriff would be to let the district attorney 
continue his investigation and await the findings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While state officials have declined to take an active role in the case, the 
Orange County Human Relations Commission announced that it will be discussing 
the issue tonight at its monthly meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, an 11-member, county-appointed panel that attempts to foster 
improved inter-group relations, will discuss and monitor the progress of the 
case to help reassure skeptical members of the black community, chairwoman Fran 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been approached by any number of people who asked about the 
investigation, who wanted to know what happened," said Williams, a psychologist 
and Rancho Santiago College professor. "They want to be assured that what 
happened was indeed an accident, and that it was non-racial." 
</P>
<P>
 While Williams said she believes the probe "is being handled well," she said 
the commission can act as a community liaison to squelch any rumors. "We don't 
want to see this escalate into something that it is not. . . We don't want to 
see finger-pointing or blame that is unfounded." 
</P>
<P>
 But some members of the black community said they need to maintain a high 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Comprising less than 2% of Orange County's population, the 42,000-member black 
community has often struggled to find a voice in local political affairs. But 
Jordan said he was impressed by how quickly civic leaders united on the Robins 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The black community is really just starting to come together as a united 
community," he said. "We were able to get a good cross-section of major 
organizations here, and I don't think that has been done in the past -- 
especially this expeditiously." 
</P>
<P>
 To capitalize on that momentum, said the Rev. Van Roberson, president of the 
Baptist Ministers Fellowship Conference in Orange County, local blacks must 
press ahead for a full and independent federal investigation in the Robins 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really hurts to have the attorney general turn us down," he said. "But I 
believe we may have to take further steps . . . to take this higher. I'm sure 
(district attorney's officials) are doing their job. It's just a matter of 
beefing it up a little bit to get some answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Levitsky, spokeswoman for the U. S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, 
said that if formally asked to review the case, "we would certainly take a look 
at it . . . to see if federal involvement is warranted." The FBI would 
ordinarily conduct such an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Claims of possible civil rights violations -- as made by black leaders in the 
Robins case -- often fall under the jurisdiction of the U. S. attorney's 
office, and federal prosecutors used such claims to retry the four officers 
last year in the Rodney G. King beating case. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Kawahara, the assistant U. S. attorney in charge of the Orange County 
office, noted that, as in the King case, prosecutors do not necessarily have to 
find a racial motive to charge that someone's civil rights were violated. But 
she declined comment on the Robins shooting, saying she had not seen any 
specifics on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's officials have insisted that they can handle the 
investigation fully and completely. Deputy Dist. Atty. Chris Evans, who is 
overseeing the case, declined comment Wednesday, however, on whether public 
attention on that issue has hampered the office's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say anything because the investigation is pending," Evans said.

CASE OF ATTACK ON SKATER TAKES BIZARRE TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The probe of an attack on figure skating star Nancy Kerrigan took a bizarre 
twist Wednesday as federal authorities were investigating the husband and 
bodyguard of her chief rival, and NBC News reported that the bodyguard had 
confessed to participating in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBC report also quoted unidentified sources as saying the weapon had been 
recovered in Detroit, from a dumpster behind the ice rink where Kerrigan was 
attacked last Thursday after a practice session at the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships. The attacker escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Wednesday, the Portland Oregonian reported that the FBI was 
investigating allegations that Tonya Harding's husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her 
bodyguard, Shawn Eric Eckardt, were involved in the attack. Harding won the 
competition in Detroit to earn a berth on the U.S. Winter Olympic team after 
Kerrigan was forced to withdraw because of the injury to her right leg. 
Kerrigan was later added to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has denied any link to the attack, saying she felt cheated of a chance 
to compete with Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," Harding said Wednesday. "I mean, why does someone want 
to discredit me? I just don't understand. It's ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC and the Oregonian said Harding had no knowledge of the alleged plot. NBC 
said authorities expected to arrest four people late Wednesday or this morning 
on federal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, Deputy Detroit Police Chief Benny Napoleon said at a news 
conference that no arrests had been made but that the investigation was 
"progressing satisfactorily." He would not comment on whether anyone had 
confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had planned to intercept Gillooly and Eckardt en route to an ice 
festival in Virginia, at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, then make an announcement 
Wednesday, sources said. Two FBI agents boarded an aircraft in Chicago 
searching for the men. When the skater and the two men were not found, 
authorities in Oregon were asked to help find them, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, from Portland, Ore., abruptly canceled the appearance in Fairfax, 
Va., today, citing problems with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, the 1992 Olympic bronze medalist, is a gold-medal favorite at next 
month's Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. She had no comment Wednesday on 
the developments in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. named Kerrigan, 24, of Stoneham, Mass., to the 
Olympic team with Harding even though she was unable to compete at the 
championships in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Portland newspaper reported that Gillooly and Eckardt allegedly spoke with 
a "hit man" about carrying out the attack. The story was based on information 
from a man who said he heard a tape of a conversation in which the plot to 
injure Kerrigan was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC said that, according to its sources, authorities do not have the tape. The 
sources said the tape was destroyed by one of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC said the alleged plot came to light because the bodyguard taped the 
meeting and later played the tape for a friend, a minister. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Oregonian, a minister named Eugene C. Saunders, 24, told a 
private investigator that he had listened to the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The Portland private investigator, Gary Crowe, said Saunders came to him for 
advice after an acquaintance played the tape recording for him. Crowe said 
Saunders told him that the tape recording made it clear that Kerrigan was the 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders told him a man's voice on the tape asked, "Why don't we just kill 
her?" 
</P>
<P>
 The response was: "We don't need to kill her. Let's just hit her in the knee." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Saunders identified the voices on the tape as those of Gillooly, 
Eckardt and an Arizona man. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowe said Saunders' acquaintance became worried after receiving threats from 
the Arizona man because Gillooly had failed to pay the $100,000 promised. 
Gillooly acknowledged that he was interviewed by the FBI earlier this week but 
denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's illegal," he told the Oregonian. "I wouldn't do that. I have more 
faith in my wife than to bump off her competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt called the allegations absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, who was married in March, 1990, has a history of marital problems 
with Gillooly, 26, who works in a state Liquor Control Commission warehouse. 
She twice has filed restraining orders against Gillooly and has filed for 
divorce two times, only to change her mind, court records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, Harding filed a report with the Clackamas County Sheriff's 
Department, accusing Gillooly of assault. No arrest was made, officials said.

GATEWAY MONUMENT KILLED; NO 'STEEL CLOUD' FOR L.A.; ARCHITECTURE: COUNCIL 
ABANDONS $33-MILLION STRUCTURE OVER HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY. MORE MODEST PLAN TO BE 
SOUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the boom and bravado of the 1980s, Los Angeles' big thinkers felt good 
enough about their town to propose construction of a grand monument to welcome 
the world, something like New York's Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 What they conceived was a massive Erector set-style sculpture. It was to have 
straddled the Hollywood Freeway near City Hall, knitting museums, theaters and 
aquariums into a maze of mechanical steel beams. 
</P>
<P>
 Price tag: $33 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday the Los Angeles City Council took a final wrecking ball to 
the whimsical and grandiose concept known as the "Steel Cloud." The action made 
official what hard times and inattention had already assured. 
</P>
<P>
 With only $144,000 accumulated in a savings account to build the city's West 
Coast Gateway, the council voted to begin a search for a more modest, 
1990s-style alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was out the window anyway. People didn't react well to the 
design," said City Councilwoman Rita Walters, who proposed the re-examination. 
"This discussion just verified it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Mayor Tom Bradley initiated the search for a civic gateway in 1987, and 
an international panel of design experts selected architect Hani Rashid's 
creation. 
</P>
<P>
 Civic planners praised the Steel Cloud as a link between the city's historic 
roots on Olvera Street and its modern Civic Center. Architects and designers 
praised it as "romantic" and a "collage that reflects the pluralism of Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The average citizen provided a few simpler similes, comparing the monument to 
a train wreck, a giant metal grasshopper and a post-earthquake skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said the city certainly has some better way to use the money than just 
letting it sit in a bank. But just how the city should spend the funds remains 
in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one contribution was ever received for the project, $100,000 from the 
Japanese-based Shuwa Corp. The firm's president said at the time that the money 
should be used for a monument with an immigrant theme, according to a council 
aide who studied the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office is studying how much latitude the city has in 
spending the funds, which have grown, with interest, to $144,000. Then the 
Cultural Affairs Department will submit ideas, perhaps after issuing a formal 
request for proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolfo Nodal, general manager of the department, noted that $144,000 does not 
go far these days as a commission. "Maybe we can have a bunch of artists stand 
at the airport and greet people," he quipped in an interview. "That would be 
ultramodern performance art." 
</P>
<P>
 On a more serious note, Nodal said the money is "nothing to sneeze at and 
could do something significant." 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can't do a Statue of Liberty," he added. "It's going to have to be a 
strong conceptual approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Nodal's staff has been tossing around a few ideas. Feeling that the Port of 
Los Angeles is a logical location for a civic gateway, someone suggested 
special lighting for the Vincent Thomas Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Another idea would expand a neon art project along Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But the brainstorming has only begun and Nodal said he welcomes suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Patsaouras, who was chosen by Bradley to raise money for the Steel Cloud, 
said he never lost faith in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good design. It's forward-looking and futuristic. It's Los Angeles," 
said Patsaouras, who finished out of the money in last year's mayor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Patsaouras, a civic dreamer who has served for years on the boards of 
local transportation agencies, conceded that the Steel Cloud's time has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The realities of where the economy was going stopped fund raising," 
Patsaouras said. "It would be unwise to solicit money when we had not resolved 
the homeless issue and other social problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters and Patsaouras said that the pro-immigrant theme of the gateway should 
be preserved, particularly because of the growing public concern about the 
social and economic impact of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a nation and a city of immigrants," said Patsaouras, who was born in 
Greece. "We want to celebrate the contributions of these people."

SALINAS ORDERS CEASE-FIRE IN TROUBLED MEXICAN STATE; REVOLT: PRESIDENT APPOINTS 
PEACE NEGOTIATOR TO TALK WITH ZAPATISTA REBELS. PARDONS ARE ALSO OFFERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to end 12 days of bloody rebellion, President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari on Wednesday announced a unilateral cease-fire in the southern state 
where Indian guerrillas have been battling the Mexican army since New Year's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The truce was declared as Salinas' newly appointed peace negotiator was 
reportedly close to making his first contact with the guerrillas, who call 
themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army after Mexican revolutionary 
hero Emiliano Zapata. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the public on television and radio, Salinas ordered the army, which 
now claims to have regained control of most of the disputed region in the state 
of Chiapas, not to fire unless attacked. And he made his most concrete offer 
yet of a pardon for those who took up arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas said he was taking the conciliatory actions to promote a peaceful 
solution to the insurrection, which has left scores dead and caused keen 
embarrassment to his government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have decided to suspend all first use of firepower in the state of 
Chiapas," Salinas said. "I fervently hope that this decision, which harvests 
the sentiments of all society, will be a first step in saving lives and finding 
new paths of reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was designed to clear the way for negotiations with the 
Zapatista rebels, who have demanded an end to bombing by the military and 
official recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas stopped short, however, of meeting their demand that troops be 
withdrawn from Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-appointed peace commissioner, Manuel Camacho Solis, arrived 
Wednesday in the Chiapas city of San Cristobal de las Casas and invited the 
rebels to contact him "wherever and whenever it is convenient." 
</P>
<P>
 Notimex, the government-owned news agency, reported that talks between Camacho 
and the rebels would begin "very probably in the next few hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho, however, cautioned that the contacts will "take some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by military, church and indigenous leaders, Camacho said he would lead 
a "peace caravan" to Ocosingo, a town about 40 miles from San Cristobal and 
scene of some of the heaviest fighting in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the army had blocked the road, barring access to journalists and 
human rights monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 This raised fears of heavy civilian casualties and hindered efforts by 
independent observers to verify alleged excesses by the army, including the 
execution of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, who the government earlier tried 
to blame for the uprising, offered support for the peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be our last, historic moment for building a new country," said 
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, an outspoken advocate for indigenous peoples and their 
rights who has clashed repeatedly with the government from his parish in San 
Cristobal. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels, many of whom are descendants of the ancient Mayas, said they are 
fighting for indigenous rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The cease-fire is one of a number of measures taken in the last three days as 
Salinas works feverishly to stanch the political damage caused by the uprising, 
which exposed the abject poverty of a part of Mexico that is often forgotten or 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiapas is one of Mexico's most destitute states, with a low literacy rate and 
a long history of violent conflict between landless peasants and politically 
connected ranchers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 For Salinas, who dedicated his presidency to achieving the North American Free 
Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada, the rebellion shattered the 
image that he had fostered abroad, that of Mexico as a modern democratic state, 
and it cast a pall on the final year of his six-year presidential term. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican stock market, which reflects investors' confidence, on Monday took 
its largest single-day plunge in four years. Bomb scares have been emptying 
public buildings daily. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for the second time in less than a week, thousands of Mexicans marched 
Wednesday through the congested streets of the capital to demand peace and 
justice for Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with such a troublesome panorama, Salinas this week replaced his 
hard-line interior minister with a veteran human rights advocate and named 
Camacho, a respected and savvy negotiator, to seek peace talks with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Salinas decisions come out of a true race against the political clock," 
said Carlos Ramirez, an editor at the newspaper El Financiero. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech Wednesday, Salinas said that in addition to the cease-fire, he 
will pardon guerrillas who lay down their arms. Previously he had said he would 
consider such an offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The armed forces, in a statement released by the Defense Ministry, said they 
will obey the cease-fire and fire only in self-defense or to protect civilians 
from attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But the statement said troops will continue to patrol highways and towns in 
the disputed areas and that air force helicopters and planes will continue 
reconnaissance flights.

ERIK MENENDEZ JURY'S NOTES MAY INDICATE PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two days after reporting it was hopelessly deadlocked, the Erik Menendez jury 
seemed back in full deliberations Wednesday with the judge disclosing two notes 
that suggested the jurors were focusing on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first note, sent late Tuesday and read aloud Wednesday in Van Nuys 
Superior Court, the jury asked for an "explanation and amplification" of 
several legal concepts, including one of the key distinctions between first- 
and second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 At noon Wednesday, its 18th day of deliberations, the jury sent another note 
asking to rehear testimony from older brother Lyle Menendez about how the 
brothers, concerned about fingerprints, picked up spent shotgun shells after 
shooting their parents to death on Aug. 20, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the foreman of the same panel had sent a note indicating a strong 
possibility of a hung jury, saying "positions have essentially not changed 
after three weeks of discussion and debate." 
</P>
<P>
 The separate jury weighing the case of Lyle Menendez, meanwhile, has continued 
deliberations without giving any such evidence of a snag. On Wednesday, its 
20th day behind closed doors, Judge Stanley M. Weisberg disclosed that the 
panel wanted to hear just one piece of evidence -- a tape-recorded interview of 
one of Lyle Menendez's friends, conducted by a free-lance writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Menendez, 23, and Lyle Menendez, 26, are charged with murder in the 
shotgun slayings of their parents, Jose Menendez, 45, a wealthy entertainment 
executive, and Kitty Menendez, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weisberg has also given the juries the option of reaching lesser 
manslaughter verdicts in each killing. 
</P>
<P>
 The notes from the Erik Menendez jury, and short hearings in open court 
Wednesday, indicated that the panel was grappling to understand the fine line 
between the various possible verdicts, spelled out in legalese cluttering about 
100 pages of jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Both notes asked for help on the meaning of malice, the factor that must be 
present to consider a killing a murder. Without it, a killing can only be 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Honor, we had a long discussion about implied malice," the jury foreman, 
a chemist and dean at Cal State Northridge, said during one of the jury's court 
appearances. "We had difficulties with some specific words." 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg cut off the foreman because jurors are supposed to communicate with a 
judge only in writing. But the judge did tell the panel: "I realize the 
instructions themselves are not always written in the clearest and most 
straightforward language." 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers admit they killed their parents in the TV room of the family's 
Beverly Hills mansion, though they testified that they fired in fear after 
years of physical, emotional and sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that the brothers killed out of hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries are hearing the case because some evidence was admitted against 
only one brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers in the case left the courthouse Wednesday without commenting. 
</P>
<P>
 But the notes from the Erik Menendez jury sparked a flurry of speculation 
among court veterans and legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would not be wasting their time or the judge's asking for instructions 
on malice if they weren't seriously considering murder as their verdict," said 
Southwestern University law professor Robert Pugsley, who has followed the 
trial closely. "It would be a hollow exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 Others noted, however, that it was also possible that the jurors were trying 
to decide between murder and manslaughter. The defense has expressed hope that 
jurors will at least rule out murder convictions, which could carry the death 
penalty or life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, experts said, prosecutors were sure to be heartened by the Erik 
Menendez jury's interest in defining murder. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Lyle Menendez jury offered hope to the defense with its 
request for the tape of a reporter's interview with Donovan Goodreau, once the 
older brother's roommate -- because it had been used by the defense to bolster 
the brothers' claims of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 interview with writer Robert Rand, Goodreau said Lyle Menendez had 
spoken of the molestation by his father. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that was certain from the day's developments, the experts agreed, was 
that the Erik Menendez jury was back at work, following Weisberg's prodding to 
keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
 The first note, sent to the judge just before the panel went home Tuesday 
evening, contained three technical questions about malice. 
</P>
<P>
 One asked for help understanding "malice in general" and "specifically, 
implied malice." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, malice does not mean what it does in common speech, namely ill 
will or hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal definition requires jurors to find that the shootings were done 
purposely, showing an intent to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 The law defines malice as either express, as when a killer makes that intent 
clear in word or deed, or implied, which requires a jury to infer deadly intent 
from the circumstances of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's second question asked for the difference between premeditation and 
malice. Premeditation means planning -- for days, weeks or years or just a few 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg said the answers to both those questions were in the instructions he 
had provided when deliberations began last month, and told jurors they had to 
read the stack more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 But he provided an answer to the third question: whether first-degree murder 
must involve express malice, but second-degree murder could involve either 
express or implied malice. 
</P>
<P>
 That was absolutely correct, Weisberg said, sending the jurors back behind 
closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few hours later, the second note was sent out. Part of it asked, "Must 
there be direct evidence to establish malice, or can circumstantial evidence be 
enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 Either will do, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, jurors asked to rehear testimony from Lyle Menendez about the shotgun 
shells, particularly a snippet from cross-examination on Sept. 21, 1993 -- an 
exchange that the Lyle Menendez jury has had reread three times since its 
deliberations began. 
</P>
<P>
 While inquiring about the brothers' purchase of two shotguns Aug. 18, 1989, at 
a sporting goods store in San Diego, Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Bozanich 
abruptly asked about what happened two nights later, after the shootings: 
</P>
<P>
 "Were you at all concerned when you picked up the shotgun shells that those 
shells might be able to be made ballistically to a particular shotgun?" the 
prosecutor asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Lyle Menendez answered. "I was concerned about fingerprints at the time. 
But although later I wondered if they could match. But, I mean, I knew 
(authorities) didn't have the gun. So I didn't think they would be able to 
match anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The Erik Menendez jury asked Wednesday to have that snippet read back twice. A 
few minutes later, they went home for the night.

WOULD-BE NATO STATES SUPPORT CLINTON PLAN; ALLIANCES: BUT UNITY DECLARATIONS 
AFTER PRAGUE MEETING BARELY HIDE CENTRAL EUROPEAN NATIONS' CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four of Central Europe's fledgling democracies lined up with President Clinton 
to support his new security formula Wednesday, but the declarations of unity 
barely drowned out their concern over the pace at which they will be drawn into 
the Western Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 After half a day of meetings with Clinton in Prague, leaders of the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia agreed to back the "Partnership for 
Peace" plan that is to integrate their nations gradually with the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as they fulfilled Clinton's desire for public support, their words 
underscored the unanswered questions and potential for conflict in a plan that 
is more hope and vision than concrete blueprint for their future security. 
</P>
<P>
 Polish President Lech Walesa, who has complained that the program leaves the 
former Soviet satellites at risk if Russia again becomes expansionist, said, 
"Sometimes small is beautiful." But his unhappy sense that others were guiding 
Poland's fate was evident as he added, "It's been decided by the powers of the 
world, and we shall try to make good use of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Czech President Vaclav Havel said he hoped the Prague gathering will be seen 
as a landmark but cautioned that the plan is "not a substitute" for the full 
NATO membership that the four countries seek. And he pointedly noted his 
unhappiness with evidence that admission had been denied because of fears that 
it would antagonize Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are independent states, and we decide ourselves about our affiliations and 
our policies," Havel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the sessions, Clinton flew to Kiev for an airport meeting with 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to bolster his sales pitch for the recent 
accord to eliminate Ukraine's nuclear warheads. Clinton then went on to Moscow, 
where the pact will be signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Landing at the Moscow airport in a light snow shortly before 1 a.m. local 
time, Clinton was greeted by a delegation including Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. The President made no statement before heading to his 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton portrayed the Prague meetings as evidence of his and the four 
nations' commitment to NATO integration, the sessions painfully revealed the 
plan's many unresolved questions and its potential for sparking competition 
among the countries that want the military and political benefits of NATO 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton tried to stress the United States' commitment to the new democracies, 
their influence in NATO's decisions and the likelihood that they will become 
full-fledged members. 
</P>
<P>
 He quoted an old Polish saying -- "Nothing about us without us" -- and 
asserted that "the security of your states is important to the security of the 
United States." Clinton said that while the new arrangement was not full NATO 
membership, "neither is it a permanent holding room." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clinton's plan, the Central European states will take steps to gradually 
draw closer to the 16 NATO states politically, economically and militarily. 
Schemes for cooperative military operations, regular political consultation and 
more open trade ties will be developed and implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Clinton Administration envisions it, the process will ultimately end in 
full NATO membership for the applicants -- possibly even Russia. At that point, 
NATO will not only become a guarantor against aggression but will also 
presumably protect member states from hostile actions by any other member. 
</P>
<P>
 That appears to be a long way down the road, however, especially since some 
West Europeans are reluctant to expand the alliance at all. And the potentially 
momentous question of whether the United States is prepared to guarantee with 
money and troops the security of Poland, the Czech Republic and other possible 
members -- perhaps by stationing U.S. troops in those countries -- is a subject 
most Americans have scarcely begun to think about. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that apprehension about whether the Partnership for Peace will in fact 
ever lead to ironclad security guarantees that underlay the doubts behind the 
public endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 As Czech citizens watching the pageantry and diplomatic drills were quick to 
point out, hazy promises of protection have repeatedly proved worthless -- from 
the earliest days of the Iron Curtain back through the world wars and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, Polish and Czech officials were already disagreeing on how 
the aspiring members could seek membership in the alliance. And Clinton had to 
publicly answer the ticklish question of whether the United States would 
decline to rescue a would-be ally if one of them was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged it was "doubtful." He could add only that "none of us 
believe . . . that is imminent." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said there had been no firmer talk of security guarantees 
behind the scenes either. "There was no hint of an explicit security 
guarantee," an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the United States is implicitly arguing to the Central Europeans that 
their best chance of future help if trouble comes is to have used the next few 
years to bind themselves closely to Europe and the United States in as many 
ways as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership, officials suggest, is the best way now available to do that, 
given Western Europe's reservations and America's current preoccupation with 
domestic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The President sought to show the Americans' good faith by offering a variety 
of sweeteners. 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the most concrete offering in the Clinton proposal, the United 
States will drop Cold War restrictions on the sale of military hardware to the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia. To help all of the four nations, which are the 
most Westernized of the former Warsaw Pact members, the United States will work 
for quicker admission to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration will earmark $30 million in seed money for an effort to 
develop democratic organizations in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also promised to organize a "council on trade and investment" in 
Washington this year and to support the four countries' regional cooperation by 
helping to develop their transportation and communications systems, including 
air traffic control. These efforts will not involve increased aid dollars, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the pledges pointed to ticklish questions. The eased sale of military 
hardware was a reminder of the risks of selling goods that, amid racking 
political changes, may not end up in democratic hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the partnership plan worry that NATO could end up training and 
outfitting the East European countries, only to have them turn away from 
democracy and free-market capitalism, perhaps becoming enemies once more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, the NATO powers must wrestle with questions of how to 
reward countries that move more quickly toward their form of government without 
inciting antagonisms among neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton began Wednesday with a morning visit to one of the world's most 
significant Jewish burial grounds, the Old Jewish Cemetery in the center of 
Prague's once-thriving Jewish ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
 About the size of a city block, the centuries-old cemetery is the resting 
place for 90,000 Jews, who had to be buried on top of one other -- in some 
cases 12 deep -- because of medieval laws barring Jews from owning real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 With 12,000 headstones piled almost on top of each other, the walled cemetery 
complex has also become the site of a Holocaust museum. The Wall of Names in 
the Pinkas Synagogue at the edge of the cemetery is being inscribed with the 
names of 77,297 Bohemian and Moravian Jewish Holocaust victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolf Hitler planned to make the Jewish quarter a "museum of an exterminated 
race," said Jaroslav Safranek, who led Clinton on a tour of the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a light-gray yarmulke, Clinton examined the wall with Rabbi Karl 
Sidon, Rabbi of the Czech Republic. Safranek led him along the twisting path 
through the cemetery, pointing out the resting place of scholar and poet 
Avigdor Kara, who in 1439 was the first to be buried in the cemetery.

CLINTON CALLS FOR SPECIAL COUNSEL TO PROBE LAND DEAL; PRESIDENCY: AIDES SAY 
REQUEST FOR RENO TO NAME INVESTIGATOR IS DESIGNED TO END 'BARRAGE OF INNUENDO' 
THAT MAY THREATEN AGENDA. FIRST FAMILY DENIES WRONGDOING. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton, grudgingly capitulating to intense political pressure, 
asked Atty. Gen. Janet Reno on Wednesday to name a special counsel to 
investigate the tangled Whitewater real estate and banking affair. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Reno from White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, Clinton called 
for appointment of a "respected, impartial and qualified attorney, who is not a 
member of the Department of Justice or an employee of the federal government, 
to conduct an appropriate independent investigation of the Whitewater matter 
and report to the American people." The investigation should be done "as 
expeditiously as possible," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said she had begun compiling a list of candidates for the position and 
intended to name the special counsel "as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she declared that the appointee would be granted substantial 
authority and should be "ruggedly independent," she left vague the parameters 
of the forthcoming investigation. She said she would "make sure that the scope 
of the investigation was sufficient to achieve the purpose that we're trying to 
secure by seeking an appointment." 
</P>
<P>
 The move, designed to end a political nightmare that has consumed vast amounts 
of White House time and energy, comes after three weeks of public pounding 
during which Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, have insisted on 
their innocence and staunchly resisted an independent inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides said the Clintons gradually found their position politically 
untenable. The impression of White House stonewalling "could end up interfering 
with the President's agenda," senior adviser George Stephanopoulos said in 
announcing the decision. "We did not want that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Clintons reluctantly agreed to the naming of a special counsel in 
hopes of putting an end to what he called "a barrage of innuendo, political 
posturing and irresponsible accusations." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House announcement came hours after Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) demanded a congressional investigation of Whitewater events. White 
House aides, asserting that their decision would thwart such a step, pointed to 
Dole's own declaration in a letter to Reno last week that if she appointed an 
special counsel, "there would be no second-guessing" of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under congressional rules, the Republican minority cannot conduct an 
investigation on its own, and Democratic leaders seem unlikely to permit such 
an investigation to start now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calls for a select congressional committee are unnecessary and are clearly an 
attempt to politicize this matter," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) said in a statement. "As previous experience has shown, an immediate 
congressional inquiry will complicate and could even undermine the efforts of 
the special counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 For Clinton, this week was supposed to be dominated by high-profile meetings 
in Europe. But senior White House aides here and in Europe found themselves 
spending hours on transatlantic phone lines over the last three days and 
nights, devising a strategy for handling the messy affair involving the 
Clintons' dealings with an Arkansas real estate investor and savings and loan 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he was appearing with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on Wednesday 
to announce an agreement for the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, Clinton was 
dogged by questions about his Arkansas business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to say about that on this trip," the President said. "I have 
nothing else to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
 After a day full of meetings on Tuesday, the Clintons and their aides 
concluded that the appointment of a special counsel, however unpalatable it 
might be in the short run, would quickly remove Whitewater from the front pages 
of the nation's newspapers. A key factor in the decision, officials said, was 
Hillary Clinton's agreement that only the naming of a special counsel could 
control the political damage caused by the Whitewater story. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater Development Corp. was an Ozark Mountains vacation resort in which 
the Clintons invested with a friend, James B. McDougal, and his wife, Susan, in 
1978. McDougal owned Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which was seized by 
federal regulators in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of at least $47.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate deal went sour as well, with the Clintons, by their account, 
losing $68,900. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican members of Congress and government investigators have raised 
questions about whether money from the thrift may have found its way into 
Whitewater's coffers or into Clinton's 1984 campaign for governor. They have 
also asked whether the thrift may have received favorable treatment from 
Arkansas authorities while Clinton was governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House judgment that naming a special counsel will quickly reduce the 
political pain of the affair is probably correct, said Marlin Fitzwater, who 
was press secretary to Ronald Reagan and George Bush during several independent 
investigations, including one involving the covert sale of arms to Iran and the 
diversion of profits to Nicaragua's Contra rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 While presidents and their aides frequently resist such investigations, they 
actually serve the interests of the White House in the long run, Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent investigation "was crucial for us during Iran-Contra," 
Fitzwater said. "Although there was some initial to-ing and fro-ing over who 
knew what when, essentially the White House was able to take the position from 
that point on that this was all being investigated by the independent counsel, 
which relieved them from the obligation of answering any questions. It's an 
enormous asset." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton White House officials made it clear Wednesday that they intend to 
adopt exactly the same tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," a senior White House aide said. "There may be a few questions we 
can answer, but on the whole it will be inappropriate to comment" from now on 
about all matters related to Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the utility of an independent investigation, the Clintons and their 
aides resisted it for several weeks. They made clear that their acquiescence 
was grudging. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still think it's wrong," Stephanopoulos said. "But the political reality 
developed, and we didn't want to be distracted from our work any more. We're 
still against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Begala, a political adviser to the White House, added: "It's a 
recognition of the reality of the way the political culture works that people 
who haven't done anything wrong have to call for a special investigation of 
themselves. You can make me accept it, but you can't make me like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the Clintons resisted an independent inquiry for so many weeks, 
Begala said: "The instinct to fight back when you're accused is very strong. 
Some of us who were trying to help may have hurt" by encouraging the Clintons 
to fight what was seen as a partisan vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Administration officials noted that in addition to that motivation, 
White House aides who have been counseling the Clintons do not know precisely 
what happened in the Whitewater affair or what the Clintons' files on the 
matter may contain. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few people other than the Clintons' personal lawyer, David E. Kendall, 
have seen the files, and no one on the White House staff has fully investigated 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides insisted that they believe that the President has done no wrong. 
On the other hand, several have bitter memories from early in the presidential 
campaign when Clinton assured them that there was nothing in the history of his 
dealings with the military draft that required an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sorts of doubts always nag at White House aides, Fitzwater said. "In 
Iran-Contra, nobody knew what happened," he said. "When you don't know all the 
facts, it's very frightening to ask for an outside investigation." 
</P>

<P>
 The text of a letter, dated Jan. 12, from White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum 
to Atty. Gen. Janet Reno: 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Madam Attorney General: 
</P>
<P>
 The President has directed me to request you to appoint as special counsel a 
respected, impartial, and qualified attorney, who is not a member of the 
Department of Justice or an employee of the federal government, to conduct an 
appropriate independent investigation of the Whitewater matter and report to 
the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 In view of the gravity of the President's responsibilities and the need for a 
prompt resolution, I respectfully request that this investigation be conducted 
as expeditiously as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Very truly yours, Bernard W. Nussbaum 
</P>
<P>
 Counsel to the President BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The major difference between the special counsel who will conduct the 
Whitewater inquiry and the independent counsels who looked into such recent 
Washington scandals as the Iran-Contra affair is who appoints them. A special 
counsel is authorized by Justice Department regulations and is appointed by the 
attorney general. An independent counsel, authorized by a provision of the 1978 
Ethics in Government Act that expired at the end of 1992, was named by a 
special three-judge panel appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States, 
usually acting on a request by the attorney general. The special counsel, like 
the independent counsel, can be fired "only for good cause, physical 
disability, mental incapacity or any other condition that substantially impairs 
the performance" of the counsel's duties, according to Justice Department 
regulations. Despite that, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno had repeatedly argued in the 
Whitewater case that the naming of a special counsel should wait until Congress 
restored the independent-counsel provision of the 1978 law. She said an 
independent counsel named by a court would automatically appear more 
independent of the Clinton Administration than anyone she selected.

FBI COLLECTS WHITEWATER DOCUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. GOODMAN and DOUGLAS FRANTZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI agents are sweeping up land records that could provide authorities with 
the first complete financial portrait of a controversial real estate 
partnership between President Clinton, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and 
the owner of a failed savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials here said Wednesday that FBI agents had taken copies of deeds 
and other records of a project of the Whitewater Development Corp., the 
partnership at the center of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 By reconstructing the sale of 44 parcels of land in Whitewater's 200-acre 
development here, the FBI could get the first complete picture of how much 
money flowed into and out of a deal that the Clintons say cost them nearly 
$69,000 in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The records also will augment a report on Whitewater prepared for the Clinton 
campaign to rebut questions about the project that were first raised during the 
1992 presidential race. Some experts contend that the campaign report does not 
represent a clear financial picture of the venture's profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, calling the Whitewater issue "ancient history," said earlier this 
week that it had been thoroughly investigated. However, only in recent weeks 
has the FBI collected hundreds of documents on the project from county offices 
in Arkansas and begun to compile the project's financial history. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Marion County clerk's and assessor's offices said that FBI 
agents had visited them several times recently, examining and copying 
Whitewater documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in, flash their badges and start going through records," said Mary 
Jo Layton, the clerk of this rural county in the Ozark Mountains of northern 
Arkansas. "They are pulling all the deeds for Whitewater." 
</P>
<P>
 The project was intended to create a resort community on the banks of the 
White River when it was started in 1978 by the Clintons and James B. McDougal, 
a Clinton political confidant who later acquired Madison Guaranty Savings & 
Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, only a handful of houses have been built on the site and the deal has 
become the focus of questions about the relationship between the Clintons and 
McDougal, whose savings and loan failed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of $47 
million. The White House asked Atty. Gen. Janet Reno Wednesday to appoint a 
special counsel to investigate Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican critics of Clinton have claimed that the White House has not 
released documents that provide an accurate picture of Whitewater's finances. 
Some of the Clintons' personal Whitewater documents were in the office of 
Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel, when he committed suicide in 
July. Only recently have they been turned over to the Justice Department, which 
had requested that a grand jury subpoena them. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the only financial picture of the Clintons' involvement in the 
ill-fated project has come from the 1992 report prepared for the presidential 
campaign. But independent experts have raised questions about the accuracy and 
thoroughness of that document. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report is rife with gaps and inconsistencies," said Bert Ely, a financial 
consultant in Alexandria, Va., who has been involved in many financial 
reconstructions. "The fact is that the numbers don't add up." 
</P>
<P>
 The report shows that the Clintons lost $68,900 on their investment in 
Whitewater. They sold their interest to McDougal for the nominal amount of 
$1,000 in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lyons, the Denver attorney and Clinton friend who commissioned the 
report in 1992, defended the document's findings in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel absolutely confident that it is a credible and reliable document," 
said Lyons. "It was the best we were able to do with the information we had at 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Some records of the partnership were missing and Lyons had the report prepared 
by a forensic accounting firm in Denver that specializes in financial 
reconstructions in difficult cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the missing documents, he said, were records of a $550,000 land purchase 
involving Whitewater in the fall of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has said that the purchase was undertaken by McDougal and his 
wife, Susan, without the Clintons' knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons said the working papers that he and the accounting firm used to prepare 
the report had been subpoenaed by the FBI and would be turned over next week.

COLUMN ONE; A COLD WAR CAPITAL WARMS UP; WHEN BILL CLINTON FIRST SAW MOSCOW IN 
'69, IT WAS THE GRIM, GRAY HUB OF A COMMUNIST EMPIRE. NOW, HE RETURNS TO A CITY 
ALIVE WITH THE CLAMOR AND CHAOS OF A NATION TRYING TO REMAKE ITSELF.

<P>
 When a bearded 23-year-old anti-war activist named Bill Clinton arrived here 
on New Year's Eve, 1969, he found a sad, gray city under the heel of 
then-Communist Party leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet troops had crushed the Prague Spring reform movement in Czechoslovakia 
the previous year; the Cold War was a deep freeze. The Communist Party was 
launching its celebrations of the 100th anniversary of V. I. Lenin's birth, and 
the Writers Union had just expelled revered novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn. 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev was a minor Communist Party functionary in Stavropol. 
Boris N. Yeltsin was an obscure Siberian construction engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow was cleaner and more orderly then, but poorer. The average Soviet diet 
was 50% starch. The nation had one telephone for every 32 people. And in Moscow 
department stores, a pair of shoes cost one-third of the average monthly 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a quarter of a century later, as leader of the Free World, Clinton 
returned on Wednesday to a Moscow that is "a new city in a new country," said 
Yuri N. Alexandrov, an architect and historian. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow once called itself the Third Rome, heir to the Roman and Byzantine 
empires. Now expatriates call it the Big Potato. The young American President 
arrives in the Russian capital as it is trying to shed its Communist trappings 
and rediscover its pre-1917 identity and, paradoxically, to fast-forward past 
the decades of Soviet stagnation into the global high-tech economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with its stunning ancient churches and equally breathtaking potholes, 
its new glitz, grime and gangsters, its neo-capitalist frenzy and its bitter 
new poverty, this metropolis of 9 million embodies Russia's struggle to remake 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a city where more than 5,000 Mercedes-Benzes crowd Cadillacs and Saabs 
in traffic jams, where people no longer gawk at the sight of a car telephone. 
But each time they park, drivers must remove their windshield wipers or they 
will be swiped. 
</P>
<P>
 Such vandalism has become so endemic that elevators in high-rises have been 
disabled by hooligans who use cigarette lighters to burn off the plastic 
control buttons for all the floors. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest thing in Moscow, though, is biznes. This is a city gone 
shopping-mad. Soviet economists once estimated that people nationwide spent 30 
billion hours each year standing in line. Today, most lines are not to buy, but 
to sell. Children hawk sodas and bananas at busy intersections, and sleek 
boutiques offer European designer fashions and Rolex watches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the average Muscovite's monthly salary is $92.65, so women still spend 
hours hunting for necessities at affordable prices. In winter, fruits and 
vegetables are still out of reach for many. 
</P>
<P>
 Russians who once sat in their kitchens arguing about literature, film and 
politics complain that the pressure to make money leaves them less time for 
friends. When they do meet, the talk is of money, shopping and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The beloved U.S. dollar is banned from commerce, as authorities try to prop up 
the value and the prestige of the ailing Russian ruble. When Clinton visited in 
1969, one ruble was worth $1.10. On Tuesday, the official rate was 1,293 rubles 
to $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spent about a week in Moscow on a winter break from his graduate 
studies at Oxford University in England, where he was a Rhodes scholar. The 
student was described as being "pudgy," bearded and always hungry by an 
acquaintance quoted in the Washington Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton stayed in the National Hotel overlooking the Kremlin -- then the enemy 
headquarters that no American President had ever visited. Today, the National 
is under scaffolding, as is much of old Moscow. Renovated 19th-Century 
buildings are unveiled almost daily, rising like pastel-painted confections 
from sidewalks crumbling into mud. 
</P>
<P>
 The National is being renovated by an Austrian firm. When it opens in August, 
it will compete with the luxurious Metropol and Baltshug Kempinski hotels, 
where the visiting White House press corps will shell out $300 and more per 
night for single rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby Lenin Museum, where student Clinton could have checked out the old 
revolutionary's Rolls-Royce, is closed by Yeltsin's decree. Across the street, 
a casino has opened up in Revolution Square, which retains its socialist name. 
The neighboring 50th Anniversary of the October Revolution Square has 
mercifully been returned to its pre-Bolshevik moniker, Manezh Square. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton takes a stroll in Red Square, he will see a tiny, gold-domed brick 
church on the spot where public toilets stood in 1969. It is the Kazan 
Cathedral, razed by Stalin in an anticlerical campaign in 1936 but rebuilt and 
reconsecrated this year by the Russian Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion is back in in the former Communist capital. Clinton also will meet 
with Patriarch Alexi II, leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, in the Danilov 
Monastery. The Communists used the 13th-Century sanctuary to lock up juvenile 
delinquents before returning it to the church in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow was spruced up for previous summits. But the only visible improvement 
this time is the removal of soot and artillery holes from the Russian White 
House. The massive marble fortress had not been built when Clinton visited in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 After President Yeltsin's tanks blasted rebels out of the former Parliament on 
Oct. 4, workers labored around the clock to repair the building for use by 
Yeltsin's Cabinet and other top officials. Before they moved in, a priest was 
summoned to bless the building with clouds of incense, as though to exorcise 
the evil spirit of the former occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 From his room at the new Radisson Slavjanskaya Hotel, the American President 
may be able to see a line of empty windows at the former Moscow mayor's office, 
now the home of the new Duma, or lower house of Parliament. The windows were 
shot out during a firefight between government forces and anti-Yeltsin rebels 
who stormed the skyscraper on Oct. 3; as of Tuesday, the windows had not been 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton probably won't be riding the Moscow Metro, which has been expanded 
since his last visit and now has electronic signs announcing how much time has 
elapsed since the last subway train departed. At rush hour, the ticker rarely 
passes the two-minute mark. And though fares have increased sharply, the Metro 
is still a bargain at 50 rubles, or 4 cents, a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily for Clinton, security precautions will keep Moscow motorists far from 
the President's limousine. The demise of the centrally planned economy has 
allowed anyone with money to buy a car, and millions of new drivers have done 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic jams are approaching Los Angeles frustration levels, with accidents 
epidemic. In 1992, 36,371 people died nationwide in car crashes -- more than 
double the number of Soviet soldiers killed in nine years of war in 
Afghanistan. The 1993 death toll is expected to be even higher. To the casualty 
list must be added the Russian who was shot by a neighbor for taking too long 
to turn off his screeching car alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow now requires that all non-Russian visitors pay a daily fee of 774 
rubles, about 60 cents. No one has suggested applying the rule to the visiting 
President, as it is mainly aimed at merchants and other people from the 
Caucasus; Russian officials blame them for much of the city's skyrocketing 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups have protested the fee as racist. But Moscow officials 
have not backed off, perhaps because public sentiment is behind them. During 
the period of martial law last fall, police detained more than 14,000 people 
and deported 5,000 who did not have permission to live in Moscow, many of them 
Caucasians. Polls showed most Muscovites were sorry to see the state of 
emergency end. 
</P>
<P>
 What irks most people more than economic hard times is the dirt, anarchy and 
carelessness that many blame on the permissive Yeltsin democrats. Last year, 
Muscovites were incensed by the discovery of more than 40,000 pieces of 
undelivered mail that had been dumped in a pond near Sheremetyevo airport, 
confirming their worst suspicions about the Russian postal service. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, what has probably changed most here is the people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 31, 1969, the day Clinton arrived here, the Communist Party official 
newspaper, Pravda, reported that America was "continuing the criminal use of 
chemical and biological weapons in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Page One stories lauded Moscow factories for having met their annual 
production quotas by the Nov. 7 anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, and 
declared that the cotton workers of Tajikistan were busy familiarizing 
themselves "with great interest" with the party Central Committee's latest 
doctrine released for the 100th anniversary of Lenin's birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nineteen-sixty-nine was a dreadful year," said Bulat S. Okudzhava, who was 
then the most popular songwriter in Russia and remains almost a national hero 
today. In an interview this week, Okudzhava said his circle had been despondent 
over the crackdown in Czechoslovakia, the stepped-up repression of 
intellectuals and the "mendacious" Brezhnev reign. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton then could hardly have spoken with any ordinary Russians, except the 
"security people and (Communist) Party people" who kept an eye on tourists, the 
bard said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 presidential campaign, Republicans suggested that the young 
anti-war activist could even have met with the KGB during his trip, an 
intimation that candidate Clinton scornfully dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 As a visiting President, "I wish he (Clinton) would stop in the street and 
talk to people," Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, Yeltsin's press secretary, said in an 
interview Tuesday. "He would see that Russia is a psychologically open 
society," not the repressed country of 1969 when "people were dressed in gray 
coats and Russian-made suits that all look alike." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is due to speak directly to the Russian people on television Friday 
and to take questions from callers in a TV "town meeting" of the sort he held 
during the presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine an American President on Russian television back then -- simply 
impossible!" Kostikov said. "Now there is even no need to negotiate with 
Russians the topic of his speech." 
</P>
<P>
 And though Russians' unquestioning worship of everything American has cooled, 
the young President should have an easy time winning the hearts of Moscow's 
youth, who are already sold on U.S. pop culture. Teen-agers are listening to 
Guns N' Roses, Poison, Culture Beat and rap, though "American rap is better," 
said Tatanya Klimenko, 16. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone are 
hot, as is Whitney Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue jeans their parents tried to buy from visiting tourists like Clinton 
are out; leggings or, better yet, bell-bottoms are in. Fashion and image matter 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the President, "I like Clinton," said Maria Romanova, also 16. "He is a 
new power. Clinton, in my view, can change the country -- both countries -- for 
the better."

RESEDA APARTMENT FIRE FORCES 250 FROM HOMES; BLAZES: LATER WEDNESDAY NIGHT, 
FLAMES GUT ONE UNIT OF A THREE-STORY BUILDING IN SHERMAN OAKS. 
</P>

 Matthew Bell, 12, was on the balcony when he noticed the fire on his 
apartment's roof Wednesday just as the door slammed shut in the 25 m.p.h. winds 
that would blast the flames across the building, seriously damaging 24 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was on fire right above where my mom was sleeping," Matthew said. "But I 
was locked out and I yelled and kicked on the door and that's when my mom woke 
up. I was shaking bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials Wednesday night were still investigating the origin of the 
blaze, which skipped through one of two U-shaped buildings at 11916 and 11926 
Roscoe Blvd. and hopped onto the other, destroying part of the roof on one 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Fire Chief Jim Young said there were unconfirmed reports by 
neighbors that bottle rockets and other fireworks had been heard in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reported injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen fire companies and about 100 firefighters turned out in the high 
winds to fight the fire that broke out at the Cordon Apartments about 3:55 p.m. 
and was extinguished by 5:15 p.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials estimated damage by fire and water to the two 32-unit buildings 
at about $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Wednesday night, fire gutted one unit of a three-story apartment 
building in the 4500 block of Woodman Avenue in Sherman Oaks, causing $50,000 
in damage, authorities said. Two residents were treated at the scene for smoke 
inhalation, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman said. About 50 firefighters 
battled the blaze for about 25 minutes before bringing it under control, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the about 250 tenants of the Reseda apartments were allowed to return 
Wednesday night to the buildings, which were still without power and phone 
service, authorities said. Some residents went to a shelter that the Red Cross 
set up at the nearby Winnetka Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Louis Herrera, 30, and his wife, Yadia, 33, were the first to arrive 
after sending their 2-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son to stay with a 
relative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what we're going to do," he said in a mixture of Spanish and 
English. "Our apartment is totally burned. Our furniture, TV, stereo and bed is 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross spokesman Tom Thompson said officials were expecting about 40 people 
to use the shelter Wednesday night, but were prepared for more people to take 
advantage of the hot food and cots as they arrived home from work or learned 
that they would not be allowed to return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bells, who do not have renters insurance, suspected that they lost 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Huddling on the sidewalk with his arm around his wife, Charles Bell, a 
bricklayer, said the roof of the building caved in on the one-bedroom apartment 
they shared with their son and a 17-year-old daughter, Heather. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked in and through the front doors and windows and I could see right 
into the sky," he said. "All of our stuff, it's all gone. They said it's mostly 
water damage, but the roof is all caved in, so if it's waterproof and 
crush-proof, I guess it's all right." 
</P>
<P>
 When the fire broke out, Matthew and his mother, Julianne, grabbed what they 
could -- their two pet iguanas and a box of family photographs -- and ran 
outside, yelling warnings to their neighbors as they made their way out. 
Charles Bell, who was driving home from work on the Ventura Freeway, saw the 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had me a bad feeling," Charles Bell said. "Then I got to Winnetka (Avenue) 
and I knew it was our building. It was a shake roof and I told my wife when we 
moved here that I didn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials confirmed Bell's description. "Anytime you get fire near a wood 
shingle roof, it's going to spread quick," said Firefighter John Mathers. "It's 
essentially tinder. We've been trying to get it outlawed for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Once residents discovered the fire, they said they organized quickly to get 
themselves, a few belongings and their neighbors out of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Smith, the complex's assistant manager, said she was coming home from her 
job at a nearby school when she saw her daughters, Kymberly and Charlene, out 
of breath on the sidewalk. The girls had alerted the building manager when they 
saw the flames and then ran through the building pounding on doors and yelling 
as they headed out, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It couldn't have happened at a worse time -- 3:30 in the afternoon," she 
said. "Children are just coming home from school and husbands and wives are 
still at work so it was difficult to know who was home and who wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and her husband, Roy, helped two women in wheelchairs out of the complex 
and then used a master key to open the doors of each apartment. "The people in 
both buildings care very much for each other and they helped one another," 
Smith said. "Everyone just pulled together." 
</P>
<P>
 While the majority of the tenants are expected to be allowed back into their 
homes today once electricity and phone service is restored, others say they 
aren't sure where they will go. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live paycheck to paycheck, trying to save some money," Charles Bell said. 
"Now it's back downhill."

PACKARD BELL REPORTEDLY NARROWS CHOICES TO 2 SITES; ECONOMY: THE CHATSWORTH 
COMPUTER FIRM IS WEIGHING INCENTIVES OFFERED BY PALMDALE AND UTAH, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Packard Bell Electronics Inc., the Chatsworth-based personal computer maker 
that announced plans to move about 1,500 jobs, has narrowed its choices for 
relocating its production facility and administrative office to Palmdale and 
Salt Lake County, Utah, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources, who are familiar with ongoing talks between Packard Bell and a 
consortium of Antelope Valley, state and county officials, asked to remain 
anonymous. However, they said Palmdale strengthened its bid this week with 
additional incentives, including favorable construction loans, to Packard Bell, 
the fourth-largest personal computer manufacturer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's bargaining position seemed strengthened Monday when Packard Bell 
announced that it was moving 420 service center jobs -- filled by employees who 
answer telephone calls from Packard Bell computer users -- to Magna, Utah, near 
Salt Lake City. The jobs pay up to $21,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Portland, Ore., was also viewed as a serious contender in the 
effort to lure Packard Bell. While Portland has not been ruled out by company 
officials, California and Los Angeles County officials said privately that 
Packard Bell is taking a harder look at the offers put on the table by Palmdale 
and Salt Lake County. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to the office of Portland Mayor Vera Katz, who has personally been 
lobbying Packard Bell, were not returned Wednesday. Packard Bell spokeswoman 
Liz O'Donnell said the company would not comment on reports that it had 
narrowed its choice to Palmdale and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah officials warned against reading anything into the transfer of the 420 
jobs, but said they viewed the move as a sign that Packard Bell is taking their 
offer seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Lake County Commissioner Jim Bradley said Packard Bell transferred the 
jobs despite few incentives offered by Salt Lake County and Utah officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not buying this company to come to town. . . . We're eager to have them 
come, but we're not desperate to have them. Our economy is very good. We've 
offered incentives, but there are certain thresholds that are in the public 
interest. Packard Bell came to us, and that's to our advantage," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley and Russ Behrmann, spokesman for the Utah Department of Community and 
Economic Development, said they hope that the quality of life in the Salt Lake 
City area will make up for the few incentives offered to Packard Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell officials said they would announce where they are moving to by 
the end of the month. The company said it has outgrown its six buildings in 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which makes IBM-compatible computers, sells them at 7,000 retail 
outlets nationwide, including Price Club and Wal-Mart. Last year, privately 
held Packard Bell's revenues were an estimated $1.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Antelope Valley and Los Angeles County officials upped the ante 
Friday in a meeting with Packard Bell officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Al McCord, Palmdale's deputy city administrator and head of the city's 
recently formed Economic Development Agency, said county officials who attended 
the meeting offered Packard Bell an additional $15-million construction loan 
payable in four years at 4% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went into that meeting on Friday with what we felt was a strong package. 
It was the first time that Packard Bell was presented a package that combined 
offers from the county and the Antelope Valley. I got a call later that evening 
from a Packard Bell representative who said the company was very impressed with 
our presentation," McCord said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incentives offered to Packard Bell by Palmdale, Lancaster and Los Angeles 
County officials and the Antelope Valley business community include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale has offered to give the company 50 acres of vacant land, worth 
about $7.5 million, where the company can build its new facilities. Utilities 
and roads have already been installed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lancaster, Palmdale and Los Angeles County have joined to offer $4 million 
in housing assistance to help Packard Bell employees move to the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale has agreed to issue $10 million in tax-exempt bonds and up to $35 
million in taxable bonds to help Packard Bell build the new facilities. This is 
in addition to the $4-million loan offered by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles County Business Loan Program also offered the computer maker 
a 10-year loan for an undetermined amount at 4% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles County Community Development Commission has offered to 
finance the construction of various sites that would house Packard Bell's 
subcontractors for a few years until those companies could go at it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antelope Valley businesses have agreed to give discounts on purchases of 
furniture and other household items to Packard Bell employees who move there. 
In addition, local builders also offered discounts of up to 3% to employees who 
buy new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bradley and Behrmann said it was impossible for Salt Lake County to meet 
each incentive put on the table by the Antelope Valley cities and Los Angeles 
County. But they said the few incentives they offered Packard Bell, plus the 
quality of life in Utah, should be enough to persuade them to move there. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said Salt Lake County has offered Packard Bell a onetime tax break of 
between $160,000 and $200,000 on the computers, machines and other equipment 
owned by the company. Businesses in Utah pay a personal property tax as well as 
taxes on real property. 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Lake County has also offered a $600,000 low-interest loan to the owner of 
the building that would house the Packard Bell facilities for remodeling and 
renovation. Packard Bell would lease the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has also offered Packard Bell a facility where it could train new 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 McCord warned that Palmdale's effort to lure Packard Bell could be dealt a 
setback unless the state authorizes the creation of an enterprise zone in 
Palmdale, where the Packard Bell facility would be located. The company would 
save almost $2 million annually in property and employee payroll taxes if the 
zone is enacted. 
</P>

 "It's been the most frustrating situation I've been involved in," McCord said. 
"It's time for the state to put their money where their mouth is. If we have a 
weak link, it's the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Shockley, an official with the state Department of Trade and Commerce 
in Pasadena, said creating enterprise zones is a laborious legislative process. 
Palmdale has been denied in the past because it did not meet the unemployment 
and poverty level requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't have a bag of tricks to make this happen," Shockley said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill pushed by Los Angeles County officials to enact an enterprise zone in 
Palmdale is under consideration in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Los Angeles City Council joined the battle to keep Packard 
Bell in the county by considering a $31,000 property tax rebate over five years 
for the company if it remains in the city of Los Angeles. The proposal will be 
discussed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Hugo Martin contributed to this story. Vying for Packard 
Bell 
</P>
<P>
 A consortium of Antelope Valley communities, led by Palmdale and Lancaster, 
has been joined by local businesses and Los Angeles County in offering 
incentives to Packard Bell Electronics Inc. in an attempt to persuade the 
personal computer maker to choose Palmdale as the site for its new production 
and administrative facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth-based Packard Bell is also entertaining offers from Utah officials 
to move the facilities and about 1,100 jobs to the Salt Lake City area. The 
company, which employs about 1,500 workers in facilities throughout the San 
Fernando Valley, has already announced that it will move 420 service center 
jobs to Magna, Utah, near Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a comparison of some of the incentives offered to Packard Bell by 
Antelope Valley officials and government leaders in Utah: 
</P>
<P>
 PALMDALE / LANCASTER 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale has offered to give Packard Bell 50 acres of land, worth about $7.5 
million, where the company can build its new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale, Lancaster and Los Angeles County have offered a special $4-million 
housing package to Packard Bell employees to move to the Antelope Valley. This 
includes assisting employees in obtaining home loans and helping relocate 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale has agreed to issue up to $10 million in tax-exempt bonds and up to 
$35 million in taxable bonds to help Packard Bell build the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles County has offered a $15-million construction loan, payable in 
four years at 4% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antelope Valley businesses have agreed to give discounts on purchases of 
furniture and other household items to Packard Bell employees who move there. 
Local builders are also offering to sell new homes at discounts of up to 3% to 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 UTAH / SALT LAKE CITY 
</P>
<P>
 Utah state and Salt Lake County officials are playing their cards close to the 
vest, but said they offered the following incentives to Packard Bell: 
</P>
<P>
 * A onetime tax break of between $160,000 and $200,000 on personal property 
owned by Packard Bell. Businesses in Utah pay a personal property tax, as well 
as taxes on real property. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salt Lake County has offered a $600,000 low-interest loan to the owner of 
the building where Packard Bell would move its production facility for 
remodeling and renovation. Packard Bell would lease the building. 
</P>
<P>
 * The state has offered the use of a training center facility to Packard Bell, 
where the company would train new employees.

STATE LEADERS HOPEFUL OF IMMIGRATION AID; BUDGET: GOVERNOR'S PLEA FOR FEDERAL 
REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS IS FINDING SUPPORT AMID NATIONAL ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE. 
STILL, TIMING AND SHORTAGE OF FUNDS ARE MAJOR OBSTACLES.

 With more states joining the battle and less partisan finger-pointing, 
California may have the best chance in years to get a sympathetic hearing for 
its plea for federal aid to offset the costs of illegal immigration, 
Administration and congressional sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson last week unveiled a state budget built on an assumption that 
about $2.3 billion in federal reimbursements could be found in the U.S. 
treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one expects California to get that much money, and certainly not 
in time to solve the state's budget problems, state and federal officeholders 
are mildly optimistic that the White House will try to find some way to address 
the state's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite many obstacles, the political pressure to lift California out of its 
economic doldrums and the Clinton Administration's sensitivity to the illegal 
immigration issue have created a more receptive atmosphere here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is very interested in helping California, and the delegation is 
united. With other states joining in the battle, we're really picking up 
steam," said Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose). 
</P>
<P>
 But there are practical reasons why any federal response won't come in time to 
mend the hole in Wilson's budget. The state Constitution requires the 
Legislature to pass the budget by June 15. Congressional appropriation 
committees generally do not approve spending bills until later in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, California has had limited success persuading Congress and the 
White House to part with money for what was viewed as a regional predicament. 
But with other big states crying for similar aid, the issue has taken on a more 
national scope. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida has announced that it will sue the federal government over immigration 
costs, and governors from New York, Arizona, New Jersey, Texas and Illinois 
have also joined the quest for federal reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who said the state may join the Florida lawsuit, is counting on this 
widening of support to blunt criticism that California alone is seeking an 
enormous federal bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has become a nonpartisan issue with a large segment of the population 
affected by unfunded federal mandates," said Beth Miller, a Wilson spokeswoman 
specializing in the immigration issue. "We hope that Clinton remembers his 
governor's roots." 
</P>
<P>
 Also fueling the restrained optimism over the issue is a relative lack of 
partisan back-biting -- at least so far. Last year at this time, Wilson was 
seeking $1.4 billion in immigration funds from Washington, but the political 
dialogue was more barbed. Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer 
took Wilson to task for blaming the Democratic Congress for not supplying the 
funds. The state eventually received $324 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's budgetary tactic this year again puts pressure on Clinton and 
Congress to respond, but so far the rhetoric has been restrained. Wilson has 
gone out of his way not to criticize Clinton on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials emphasize that California's demands will be extremely 
difficult to meet, but with other states -- some with powerful Democratic 
governors -- broadening the issue geographically, Clinton could help California 
without seeming to single it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prospects for some type of aid are brighter this year than they've ever 
been," said Frank Collins, senior aide to San Diego Rep. Randy (Duke) 
Cunningham. "On a scale of one to 10, it's a four, not the usual zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein on Tuesday sent President Clinton a three-page letter, urging 
increased budget requests for a variety of immigration-related programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government mandates that the states absorb the costs of providing 
services to illegal immigrants," Feinstein wrote. "Clearly, the state can't do 
it. I'm going to lead the fight on behalf of the congressional delegation to 
right this wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation has not yet mapped out a precise legislative strategy. But the 
members appear committed to keeping the pressure on the Administration to 
deliver some kind of aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Any inclination to help California will have to overcome the stark reality of 
the federal government's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of his budget address last week, Wilson called Leon E. Panetta, 
Clinton's budget director -- and former California congressman -- to alert the 
White House to the call for billions in federal reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Panetta certainly expressed sympathy with the problem, but he also pointed 
out the severe budget restrictions facing Congress," said Barry Toiv, a 
spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. "There's a lot more sympathy 
(on the immigration issue), but the dollars are very tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta told Wilson he wanted to meet with governors from all the states who 
are facing similar immigration problems when they come back for a National 
Governors Assn. meeting later this month. "But frankly it's a difficult issue 
that the Congress will ultimately have to decide," Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration source conceded that the issue "will not go unresponded to" 
but said it will take some imaginative legislative maneuvers to get around 
severe budget restraints.

SACRAMENTO PAPER TO CLOSE; MEDIA: AILING ECONOMY AND INABILITY TO FIND 
FINANCIAL RESCUERS ARE CITED IN THE DEMISE OF THE 142-YEAR-OLD UNION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The struggling Sacramento Union, born as a scrappy daily newspaper in the Gold 
Rush and once a powerful voice in the affairs of California, said Wednesday it 
will cease publishing on Friday for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of the newspaper, which briefly employed Mark Twain as a reporter 
and until recently called itself the "oldest daily in the West," leaves the 
much bigger Sacramento Bee as the state capital's only daily paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is with great regret that we say we are unable to save the newspaper and 
turn it around," said Ralph Danel Jr., whose family bought the Union two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Danel blamed the failure on deteriorating economic conditions in the deep 
California recession and the inability to find a buyer or investors willing to 
rescue the 142-year-old newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least 25 years, the Union had battled for survival in an advertising 
market dominated by television and the Bee. It severely reduced its staff, sold 
its printing presses and for a time embraced pro-American, anti-abortion and 
pro-business themes that were supposed to attract more readership. 
</P>
<P>
 In desperation, the Union in October switched from daily publication to three 
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Editor Ken Harvey, a 27-year veteran of the paper, said the demise of the 
Union will mean the loss of an "independent voice that always tried to speak up 
for taxpayers" and against bigger government programs, waste and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Goldstein, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley, 
lamented the loss of yet another newspaper. "Certainly, the Union was not in 
its most glorious period recently," Goldstein said, "but any kind of 
competition is preferable to less competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Circulation of the Union is believed to have fallen below 30,000, far below 
its peak of about 123,000 in the late 1970s, and its editorial staff totaled 
only 20 people. By contrast, the Bee's audited circulation in September totaled 
269,665 daily and 337,982 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 While in recent years the Union reflected only a shadow of its earlier self, 
it long was regarded as a substantial influence in the economic, political and 
social development of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper started publishing as a four-page daily in 1851, three years after 
the discovery of gold in the Sierra foothills, and fought for the rights of 
working miners. Until several months ago, it billed itself as the oldest daily 
in the West, a distinction disputed by the Oregonian in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1866, the Union hired a young adventurer who used the name Mark Twain as a 
reporter to write a series of letters on his travels to distant Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, the newspaper was a hearty advocate of construction of 
the transcontinental railroad that was to link California with the East. 
</P>
<P>
 The Union went through many ownership changes, but put up its stiffest 
challenge to the Bee in the mid-1960s when it was bought by Copley Newspapers 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Copley poured vast sums into the Union, hiring platoons of reporters, editors 
and advertising sales people and investing heavily in a new building and 
state-of-the-art color printing equipment. Circulation almost doubled to about 
90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Copley organization sold the Union in 1974.

BYSTANDER KILLED; POLICE BULLET BLAMED; VIOLENCE: SAN DIEGO AUTHORITIES BELIEVE 
WOMAN WAS HIT WHEN OFFICERS FIRED ON A MAN WHO BRANDISHED A GUN. THE SUSPECT 
MAY BE CHARGED WITH MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bullets apparently fired from an officer's gun killed an innocent bystander 
during a shootout with a suspect on a downtown street Tuesday, a San Diego 
Police Department spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred at 4:40 p.m. amid rush-hour traffic in front of a 
crowded residential hotel. Two bicycle-riding officers confronted a suspect who 
investigators said provoked the melee by pointing a .45-caliber handgun at 
police after waving it on a crowded street corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Gina Liucija Kisielius, 33, stumbled into the lobby of the 
Golden West Hotel on 4th Avenue, crying and bleeding, according to a longtime 
resident of the hotel, Lance Corbett, 46. Kisielius, also a hotel tenant, 
collapsed on the floor and died, Corbett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kisielius had lived for years in the turn-of-the-century single-room-occupancy 
building, which serves as a home largely to retirees and people with 
disabilities on fixed incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Enrique Leon, 42, on suspicion of murder. Leon was reported to 
be in fair condition Wednesday with at least three gunshot wounds. Police said 
he would be charged with murder. Such charges can be filed against someone who 
commits a crime that results in the death of another person, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to say Wednesday whether Leon fired first -- or at all -- 
although they said witnesses reported that Leon was the first to fire shots. 
Homicide Lt. Greg Clark said police would not conclusively rule on whether the 
officers killed Kisielius until all ballistics tests were complete. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was probable, Clark said, that police gunfire felled the woman, who was 
standing on the sidewalk in front of the hotel when officers began firing the 
first of 13 rounds from five yards behind the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said the officers involved in Tuesday's shootout have been placed on 
administrative leave, pending a full investigation by the department's internal 
affairs unit and the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Police Department appointed a citizen review board to study 
officer-involved shootings after a wave of incidents involving deadly force 
prompted a call for action in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In that year alone, police killed nine people and wounded 14 others. Among 
those killed were men wielding a garden tool, a trowel and a baseball bat. 
Another man was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Escondido, in north San Diego County, a reworking of the city Police 
Department's training and regulations regarding hostage situations followed the 
1983 death of Leslie Landersman, who was killed by police while being held 
hostage by a bank robber. She was mistakenly slain in a gun battle.

MAHONY CALLS FOR 'TRUE LEADERSHIP' ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Cardinal Roger M. Mahony warned Wednesday that politicians 
exploiting the immigration issue for votes threaten "to drive an even deeper 
wedge between people in our communities" in this election year. 
</P>
<P>
 An outspoken defender of immigrants' rights, Mahony called for "true 
leadership" from those who are willing to address the immigration issue with 
"creativity and compassion" that he said "has been absent so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony also contended that "legislation tends to be piecemeal, and, therefore 
ineffective" because of the lack of a comprehensive overall immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prophetic vision will emerge when we are willing to include the moral 
dimension in the discussion, when we are able to recognize the immigrant as a 
sister or brother, not the enemy; as an opportunity to strengthen our 
community, not a problem to be solved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cardinal made his remarks in testimony before an Assembly committee on the 
impact of immigration. Headed by Assemblywoman Grace Napolitano (D-Norwalk), 
the committee held its fifth and final hearing on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is expected to present its findings and recommendations to the 
Legislature in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony criticized legislation designed to deter illegal immigration as well as 
two proposed ballot initiatives aimed at cutting public aid to illegal 
immigrants for health care and public schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immigration into this country will not be controlled solely through the 
measures being proposed (such as) denying basic human services, militarizing 
our borders, creating tamper-proof identification cards or constructing other 
obstacles across our borders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said several principles based on moral and ethical concerns should be 
included in an overall immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Mahony said, every person is endowed with a basic and fundamental 
dignity as a creature created by God -- regardless of their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 "Respect for human dignity and human life is not negotiable," Mahony said. 
"Human dignity is not determined by social class, citizenship, race or 
ethnicity."

FARMERS DEFY ORDER TO PROTECT BIRDS FROM DEATH IN TOXIC PONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of California biggest farmers are defying a state plan to prevent the 
deaths of tens of thousands of migratory birds poisoned by toxic runoff from 
cotton and alfalfa fields in the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 State regulators say farmers in the Tulare Lake basin, including cotton giant 
J.G. Boswell Co., have flouted key provisions of the plan that would keep 
waterfowl from harm in the selenium-laden drainage ponds dotting the vast west 
side of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a plan in place that begins to address the problems of these 
contaminated ponds," said Anthony Toto, an engineer for the Central Valley 
Regional Water Quality Control Board, which oversees the waste discharge. "But 
some of the biggest pond operators are refusing to comply with the plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Toto said the farmers face a $1,000 a day fine for violating the order, which 
went into effect in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The intransigence of the Tulare Lake Drainage District -- which operates 3,000 
acres of contaminated ponds -- is especially troubling, say environmentalists, 
because adoption of the state plan was considered a victory for the big 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan is a sweetheart deal for them," said Patrick Porgans, an 
independent consultant on water-related issues in Sacramento. "And now they 
have the gall to say they don't even want to comply with its lenient 
provisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and several environmentalists, including 
Porgans, have petitioned the state to rescind the plan. They argue that it 
falls short of protecting migratory birds such as eared grebes, American 
avocets and black-necked stilts from 5,200 acres of toxic ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager of the Tulare Lake Drainage District said growers had not acted in 
bad faith. He said the filing of the petitions was the only reason the district 
has delayed implementing the centerpiece of the plan, which calls for growers 
to set aside land for new, clean ponds where the birds can nest and feed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have every intention of complying with the state plan and on a number of 
points we are ahead of schedule," said Doug Davis, manager of the Tulare Lake 
Drainage District. "But how can we put forward a detailed plan on new marshland 
habitat when the appeals could change the plan?" 
</P>
<P>
 State regulators said, however, that any new habitat the farmers establish 
during the petition process is likely to remain and be expanded in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The contaminated ponds are a byproduct of half a century of irrigation that 
has leached toxic salts from deep in the soil and trapped them in the root 
zone, requiring growers to flush their fields. The discharge was supposed to be 
drained off to San Francisco Bay but objections by environmentalists and a 
shortage of funds thwarted the building of a "super sewer." 
</P>
<P>
 A half-finished drain stopped at what is now Kesterson National Wildlife 
Refuge, where fish and wildlife biologists discovered in the 1980s that high 
levels of selenium were killing 15,000 adult birds a year and deforming 
countless chicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage wrought by the Tulare Lake basin ponds makes Kesterson pale by 
comparison, federal biologists say. Environmental groups have criticized the 
U.S. Justice Department for not bringing action on the ponds under the 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all large growers have defied the state plan, Toto said. One grower, 
Westlake Farms, has not only agreed to set aside a large swath of land for new 
habitat but will alter existing ponds to dissuade waterfowl from nesting there.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: BABY DELIVERY, CITIZENSHIP AND TAX MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sally Super is the head nurse in a hospital maternity ward five miles north of 
the Mexican border. Don't try to convince her that Mexicans are coming to the 
United States illegally only for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 She's been delivering babies for 12 years in San Diego's South Bay and has 
cared for many pregnant women from Mexico. "We know the big magnet to come 
across is the (U.S.) birth certificate," she says. "All you have to do is ask 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 She also sees the women getting in and out of cars with Baja license plates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a policeman from Tijuana who brought over his pregnant wife before 
Christmas because he wanted the baby to be delivered here for the birth 
certificate," says Super, who manages the maternity floor at Sharp-Chula Vista 
Medical Center. "When we found she was not in active labor, we encouraged her 
to go back to her own physician." 
</P>
<P>
 The policeman arrived too soon. If his wife had been in active labor, the 
hospital legally -- and ethically -- could not have turned her away because it 
would have been an emergency case. Taxpayers probably would have paid for the 
delivery through Medi-Cal. The baby automatically would have become a U.S. 
citizen and potentially eligible for all the benefits -- welfare, health care, 
food stamps, a nutrition program. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there's an underground out there, where people are coached on how 
to get into the system," Super says. 
</P>
<P>
 At nearby Scripps hospital, another maternity nurse explains how she can tell 
which women have entered the country to deliver a baby: 
</P>
<P>
 "The patient's in labor still screaming and the father wants to know who he's 
going to talk to about the birth certificate. . . . I had one lady a couple of 
weeks ago who said she came here because she wanted American medical care 
instead of Mexican care. She was honest; I respected that. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying anything that's not common knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It may be common knowledge in hospitals, but it's not always politically 
correct to discuss in capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has been loudly denounced as an "immigrant basher" for 
suggesting that the U.S. Constitution be amended to deny automatic citizenship 
to children born of women who are in the country illegally. He also has been 
widely criticized for urging the federal government to stop requiring that 
states provide health care, education and other benefits for illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is insane," Wilson recently told ABC's "20/20." "We say you may not 
enter the country illegally. However, if you do, the following benefits are 
available to you. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to let a person who needs emergency care go without it. That 
is an ethical response. However, it's not fair because the patient should never 
have appeared on your doorstep. . . . If they go to the hospital and are on the 
edge of delivery, then you provide the necessary service. After which, it would 
seem to me, we ought to deport them." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't that cruel? "Let me ask you something," the governor replied. "Is it 
cruel to the California child who doesn't get prenatal care because the 
(illegal) immigrant mother does? I mean, that's what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of rhetoric understandably scares Latino legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware of discrimination," says freshman Assemblyman Grace F. Napolitano 
(D-Norwalk), who chairs a special legislative committee on immigration. "People 
say, 'You're too sensitive.' But unless you're in the skin, you can't feel it. 
. . . I'm not against anybody being asked for documentation that proves they 
have a right to be here -- as long as it's done for every single person." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, of course, is using illegal immigration as a political issue as he 
runs for reelection. But he also has a colossal budget problem partly caused by 
the burden of servicing illegal immigrants. So will the next governor unless 
the problem is corrected. That is why California politicians of all ideologies 
and ethnicities are supporting Wilson's effort to prod Washington into paying 
for the services it mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is demanding $2.3 billion from the federal government, but actually 
figures the state's annual tab for servicing illegal immigrants and their 
children is $3.6 billion. It breaks down this way for illegal immigrants: $1.7 
billion for education, $400 million for Medi-Cal and $400 million for 
imprisoning felons. Another $1.1 billion goes for education, health care and 
welfare for citizen children of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The state estimates that illegal immigrants account for 40% -- roughly 100,000 
a year -- of all births paid by Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Sally Super: "We can't continue to do this. We don't have enough money. 
We've seen abuse of the system over and over again. But that's my opinion. It's 
for the politicians to debate."

LORENA BOBBITT TESTIFIES ON ABUSE CLAIMS; ASSAULT: SHE SAYS SHE WAS RAPED, 
BEATEN AND SUBJECTED TO 'MARINE-TYPE TORTURES' BY HUSBAND. WITNESSES IN 
MUTILATION CASE SAY THEY SAW BRUISES. 
</P>

<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt, charged with cutting off her husband's penis, took the stand 
in her own defense Wednesday and told a jury in a trembling voice that her 
husband, John Wayne Bobbitt, raped her, beat her and used "Marine-type 
tortures" to cow her into submission during the violent course of their 
four-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In halting English, the Ecuadorean-born woman described being forced to 
participate in anal sex and being threatened frequently with a repetition of 
the act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later, every time we had sex he would threaten me," she said softly. "He 
would say he would like to have that kind of sex. . . . I tried not to let it 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Bobbitt's emotional testimony came on the third day of a trial that has 
drawn international attention because of the unusual nature of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on a charge of malicious wounding the 24-year-old manicurist 
faces up to 20 years in prison as well as deportation to Venezuela, where she 
grew up. Although Mrs. Bobbitt has admitted committing the mutilation of her 
husband, the defense has taken the position that she was a battered wife driven 
to temporary insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, an ex-Marine whose penis was reattached after nine hours of 
surgery on the day after the June 23, 1993, incident, was acquitted of marital 
assault last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the evidence produced in the last two days of testimony was never 
introduced at the previous trial, which was limited to the events that 
immediately preceded the mutilation and focused more narrowly on the issue of 
whether John Bobbitt had raped his wife on the night in question. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense hopes to convince the jury of seven women and five men that Mrs. 
Bobbitt is the "classic example" of a battered spouse who, pushed to the edge 
by "constant and relentless violence," acted on an "irresistible impulse" she 
could not control. 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, defense lawyers Blair Howard and James Lowe began by putting John 
Bobbitt on the stand as a hostile witness and allowing him to deny a series of 
specific instances in which Mrs. Bobbitt has said that she was beaten, 
threatened or verbally abused by him. 
</P>
<P>
 They then began calling witnesses who testified that they had seen Bobbitt 
abuse his wife on those occasions or that they had seen bruises on her body. 
</P>
<P>
 Two witnesses, friends of Bobbitt's, also testified that he once confessed to 
enjoying forced sex and watching women "squirm." 
</P>
<P>
 As the extraordinary trial entered its third day Wednesday in this small town 
30 miles west of the nation's capital, six more witnesses -- either friends or 
acquaintances of Mrs. Bobbitt -- testified that she came to them, crying 
hysterically at times, after Bobbitt had beaten her. 
</P>
<P>
 From their comments to reporters earlier in the trial, it was clear that 
Bobbitt's lawyers had been hoping to discredit his wife's accusations by 
reminding the jury that no physical evidence of abuse was ever uncovered at his 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But while a physician who treated Mrs. Bobbitt for stress-related symptoms 
last June admitted under cross-examination that she saw no bruises on her body, 
four other witnesses called by the defense Wednesday testified that they saw 
bruise marks and swellings on her arms, shoulders, head and hips when she came 
to them after an episode of alleged abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes she would get hysterical and shake and cry. At other times she 
would be very quiet and depressed," said Mary Jo Willoughby, a friend in whom 
Mrs. Bobbitt confided frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw bruises on her wrists, upper arms and forehead," declared Beth Ann 
Wilson, the assistant manager of the apartment building where the Bobbitts 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling an incident that occurred about two weeks before the mutilation, 
Wilson said that she was talking with Mrs. Bobbitt and watched her begin to 
tremble visibly when her husband approached. "You could see the fear in her. It 
was obvious she was having a terrible time." 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness, Mercedes Castro, said that she took Polaroid pictures of 
bruises on Mrs. Bobbitt's right hip, left shoulder and arms when the defendant 
came to her home one night in early 1991, looking "really scared and crying." 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional high point of the trial came when Mrs. Bobbitt herself was 
called to the stand earlier than the defense originally had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Before eliciting Bobbitt's testimony, defense lawyers had planned to question 
a psychiatrist who would buttress the argument that the defendant was 
psychologically driven to commit an act that she never would have contemplated 
under normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Herman Whisenant Jr. ruled that the psychiatrist could testify only 
about facts already introduced into evidence. His ruling could have hampered 
the testimony unless Mrs. Bobbitt introduced into the record some of the 
alleged episodes on which the psychiatric evaluation was based. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly two hours on the stand, she gave her account of episodes described 
in almost mirror-image fashion by her husband the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 She spoke softly at first of how marrying the young, handsome Marine lance 
corporal had been a "dream" come true -- one that meant she could have the home 
and family that she always wanted in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said the dream soon became a nightmare. Her husband began abusing her, 
she testified, when she objected to his desire to make extravagant purchases 
that they could ill-afford or to his inclination to invite friends and family 
to stay at their tiny efficiency apartment without consulting her beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Bobbitt said that he first hit her while they were driving home from an 
evening at a Washington bar. He was drunk and "zig-zagging all over" the road, 
she said. She pleaded with him to pull over to the side of the road and tried 
to grab the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he punched me. I started to cry and he called me ugly names and told me 
to stop but I couldn't." When the couple arrived home, "he hit me and pulled my 
hair and squeezed my face and told me, 'I told you not to cry,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the violence gradually worsened, she testified. Bobbitt not only 
struck her but used what she characterized as "Marine-style torture . . , 
karate-type techniques" to abuse her.TRIALS

ACTIVISTS WANT ALL AMERICANS TO BE TOUCHED BY KING DAY; GROUP PUSHES COMMUNITY 
SERVICE AS A WAY TO GIVE HOLIDAY MORE RECOGNITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the nation stands poised to commemorate the ninth annual Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day on Monday, the slain civil rights leader's widow and other activists 
are clamoring for broader nationwide recognition of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, unfortunately, too many Americans perceive the King holiday as an 
African American holiday," said Coretta Scott King, who is chairwoman of the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission, a federal agency charged 
with coordinating observance of the holiday. "Our goal is to change this to 
help them understand that the King holiday is an American holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 As partial evidence that the holiday is getting too little recognition, the 
commission points to a recent nationwide survey indicating that 67.4% of 
Americans participated in no events to mark the day. Although the figure was 
down from 74.5% in 1991, it remains too high, commission members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who said they did mark the day in some way, 52% did so by taking the 
day off, while 12% participated in a church or school function. 
</P>
<P>
 The observance was created on Nov. 2, 1983, through legislation signed by 
then-President Ronald Reagan. It designated the third Monday of every January 
as a federal holiday honoring King. The commission was created 10 months later 
to oversee the holiday's observance nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 King's widow serves as a lifetime member of the group, which cannot draw more 
than half of its members from the same political party. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners include Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Housing and Urban 
Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, former George Bush Administration 
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and musician Stevie 
Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the commission and other groups have planned a series of 
efforts not only to broaden Americans' awareness of the holiday, but also to 
transform it from a largely ceremonial event into an occasion for activism and 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission and other groups are calling for Americans to remember King by 
undertaking community service projects and by working to help combat the rising 
tide of violence among America's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Community service and nonviolent social change were cornerstones of King's 
philosophy, they say, and should become the means by which the day is 
commemorated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made great progress with the King holiday, but it is not where it 
should be, not where we want it to be, and certainly not where it can be," 
Coretta Scott King said. "We want the King holiday to become a time for every 
American to make a contribution, however small, to help alleviate such 
conditions as hunger, homelessness and illiteracy, to fight drugs, gangs, crime 
and violence in all forms." 
</P>
<P>
 As in years past, the King Center in Atlanta is working to whip up enthusiasm 
for the holiday by sponsoring National King Week, which includes an awards 
ceremony in Washington honoring recipients who have "made significant 
contributions to the growth, spirit and development" of the holiday, a 
symposium in Atlanta addressing the problem of youth violence, a parade in 
Atlanta on Saturday and a commemorative service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in 
Atlanta on Monday, at which Coretta Scott King will deliver a "State of the 
Dream Address." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's efforts have found a foot soldier in the American Committee to 
Invigorate the King Holiday, a newly formed group headed by Peter B. Kovler, 
who also spearheaded widely publicized efforts in 1982 to commemorate the 
centennial of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kovler says his committee hopes to serve as a resource-and-information 
clearinghouse for publicizing the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is also getting a jump start on planning next year's activities 
and will hold a national planning conference in Los Angeles from April 19-23.

VANCOUVER GETS CRUISE SHIP TRADE, SEATTLE GETS FUMES; A 19TH-CENTURY LAW KEEPS 
U.S. PORTS MOSTLY OUT OF AN INDUSTRY THAT GREW 175% IN 10 YEARS. THEY'RE 
FIGHTING BACK, BUT IT'S A TASK. 
</P>

<P>
 Never mind all those collapsing trade barriers, the hoopla over the North 
American Free Trade Agreement and the race for global commerce. Seattle and 
other U.S. port cities are fast aground on the barnacles of a 19th-Century 
protectionist statute, unable to rise to one of the tantalizing economic booms 
of the age: the explosion of cruise ship tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, hundreds of thousands of Americans will arrive at Seattle's Sea-Tac 
airport, bound for an Alaska cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 From the baggage claim these passengers will be directed into buses and 
chauffeured up Interstate 5, passing downtown Seattle as fast as traffic 
allows. Destination: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 There, they will board their cruise ship and sail north through the Inside 
Passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver gets the tourist dollars and port business; Seattle is left with the 
diesel fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 And a galling situation it is for this waterfront city that believes nothing 
so much as its own irresistibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The ships of the great Klondike Gold Rush went from Seattle's ports and made 
many people rich. How, today's residents ask, can this one be passing them by 
-- after all, the cruise ship industry has grown about 175% in the last 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent accounting, Canadian officials reported 236 annual callings by 
Alaska cruise ships, which carried about a half-million passengers. Seattle, 
meanwhile, was port of call for only seven ships and 2,722 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduce it to the language of commerce, and Seattle counts it this way: $117 
million to Vancouver, $4.5 million here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrible. Silly," groans Bob Gogerty, one of the state's foremost 
behind-the-scenes political powerbrokers. He has been enlisted to lead 
Seattle's crusade to open the city to Alaska cruise lines. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a task. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to 1886, when proud ships carried square-rigged sails, Congress passed a 
law prohibiting foreign-flagged vessels from transporting passengers between 
U.S. ports. Such ships could still call on the United States from abroad, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's legal for foreign-registered liners to leave from Canada to call on 
Alaska. But not if they leave from Washington state. Similarly, California 
passengers bound for Hawaii on foreign registered ships find themselves bused 
to Ensenada, Mexico, for departure. Only Puerto Rico has been able to secure a 
congressional exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale for this deeply entrenched and vigorously defended law -- and 
its statutory twin that applies the same rules to freighters and tankers -- was 
to keep the U.S. shipbuilding and maritime industries healthy, for the good of 
workers and national defense. 
</P>
<P>
 For a host of reasons this has not happened, including the U.S. Coast Guard's 
extra-high safety standards for domestic-built passenger ships and a 
prohibition, repealed only two years ago, against any gambling on domestic 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, all of the world's cruise ships fly flags of nations other than the 
United States, except for two 1951 vessels that ply the waters of Hawaii. The 
U.S. has not produced a large, ocean-going cruise ship in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, 85% of the world's passenger liners call on U.S. ports, and 85% of the 
passengers are Americans, according to statistics from the National Cruise Ship 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Maritime labor unions and shipbuilding interests continue to defend the laws 
and block nearly all exemptions, by virtue of their influence on the House 
Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. Their hope is to bring the business 
home, particularly now that domestic labor costs are no greater than those in 
competing maritime countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The cruise companies like Holland America, Princess and the others have merely 
gone across U.S. borders with their departure ports. 
</P>
<P>
 And the few hours that passengers must endure in a bus has hardly slowed the 
boom -- already destinations like Juneau are jammed with liners, and the 
premiere Alaska way-stop of Glacier Bay National Park is full with all the 
ships that the Park Service will permit. 
</P>
<P>
 With Seattle leading the way, U.S. ports believe that they may have the 
foundation of a compromise for rewriting the federal law to give domestic 
cities a shot at the cruise lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by Rep. Jolene Unsoeld (D-Wash.), the proposed legislation would 
provide loan guarantees and other financial incentives for domestic 
shipbuilding. Foreign companies would be allowed greater investment in ships 
carrying the U.S. flag, in hopes of stimulating joint-ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the bill would allow foreign-flagged vessels to depart from 
domestic ports immediately as long as their owners promised to begin building 
U.S. replacement ships within three years. The United States also would scrap 
Coast Guard requirements that exceed international safety standards for 
passenger liners. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the bill proposes to grant U.S. flagged ships preference in entering 
Glacier Bay, famous for its wildlife and stunning displays of ice. Now, all 107 
summer permits to visit the park are used by foreign-flagged vessels.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS BLAMED AS WACO CULT TRIAL OPENS; JUSTICE: DEFENSE SAYS 
GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEATH OF 4 AGENTS. PROSECUTOR CONTENDS THE 11 
DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN A DELIBERATE AMBUSH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In opening statements Wednesday, defense attorneys for surviving members of 
the Branch Davidian cult argued that federal firearms officials caused the 
death of their own agents last February by forcibly invading the "peaceful, 
religious life" of the group near Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecutor in the case, while making no attempt to defend the wisdom 
of a raid on the cult's headquarters by agents from the Treasury Department's 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, argued in return that the "ATF is not 
on trial here." Rather, he said, the 11 defendants deliberately ambushed the 
agents in accordance with leader David Koresh's "theology of death." 
</P>
<P>
 The statements -- which painted a widely different view of the cult and its 
members -- launched testimony in the trial of 11 cult members charged with 
conspiring to murder four ATF agents killed during a Feb. 28 raid on the 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides determining the guilt or innocence of the accused, the trial also is 
expected to provide the first clear picture of what occurred inside the 
compound during 51 fateful days last spring. A key prosecution witness in the 
case will be former cult member Kathryn Schroeder, who has agreed to testify in 
return for facing a lesser charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The ill-fated ATF raid led to a 51-day standoff between federal agents and the 
cult members that ended only when FBI agents, using armored vehicles and tear 
gas, stormed the headquarters on April 19. More than 85 people ultimately died 
when a fire -- allegedly set by cult members -- consumed the compound shortly 
after the final assault began. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr. impaneled a jury here after moving the 
trial 180 miles south from Waco on grounds that he would find a less-biased 
group of jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys Jeff Kearney and Dan Cogdell charged that in ordering the 
raid -- ostensibly because weapons were being stockpiled at the compound -- ATF 
officials were seeking "a dynamic event" that would draw attention to the 
agency's work. They noted that the episode occurred shortly before Congress was 
to consider its annual budget and at a time when some ATF officials feared that 
their agency was losing its identity and might be merged into the FBI, an idea 
that has since been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATF could have chosen quietly instead to serve arrest and search warrants 
on Koresh during one of his trips outside the fenced compound, Kearney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Ray Jahn argued that the killings occurred as a direct result 
of the cult's philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "David Koresh taught that, 'if you want to die for God, you must be willing to 
kill for God,' " Jahn told the jury. "This trial is about a physical act -- 
murder. This is not a trial about religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Jahn went on to say that the government's evidence "will put a firearm in the 
hands of each defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the murder charges against them, the defendants could face 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those on trial left the compound early in the ensuing siege, while 
others escaped during the April fire. Three are British, one is Australian and 
one is Canadian. All except one are men. 
</P>
<P>
 A harsh report by an investigative panel in October criticized the raid's 
planning and execution. ATF director Stephen E. Higgins abruptly retired on the 
eve of the report and five other agency officials took early retirement or were 
suspended.

SUPREME COURT STAYS WOMAN'S GOING TO CITADEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gates of The Citadel opened just long enough Wednesday for Shannon 
Faulkner to register as the first female to attend day classes with cadets, 
then closed again when the nation's top judge blocked her from attending 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the 151-year-old military college, Supreme Court Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist granted a stay to keep the 18-year-old student 
from attending classes today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance is not so much that the injunction has been delayed for 
three or four days. The significance is that the Supreme Court is taking this 
issue very seriously," said Dawes Cooke, the school's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citadel and Virginia Military Institute are the nation's only all-male, 
state-supported military colleges. Admissions policies at both are the target 
of federal lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, who plans to major in education, walked several hundred yards 
through a driving rain and a horde of reporters to register Wednesday in Bond 
Hall, the turreted administration building that dominates one end of The 
Citadel's parade ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect all of this and I didn't really expect to be here," Faulkner 
said as she advanced through the crowd to meet her academic adviser, register 
and pay tuition. "I actually expected the battle to be a lot longer." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was treated nicely by college officials and signed up for 
biology, math, English, history and education. But she said she felt 
"overwhelmed" by the attention.

 "Everybody is saying, 'You're making history,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although cadets promised to treat her with respect, some were hoping for a 
last-minute reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want the Class of 1994 to be labeled as the year of Shannon 
Faulkner," senior Will Benton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner initially was accepted by the college after she had references to her 
gender deleted from her high school transcript. The Citadel rejected her 
application when it discovered she was a woman. She sued, challenging the 
constitutionality of the all-male admissions policy 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, a federal judge said Faulkner could attend classes, but not join 
the corps of cadets, while her lawsuit proceeds. The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of 
Appeals refused to overturn the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, who is from Powdersville, S.C., said she would like to become a 
full-fledged member of the grey-uniformed corps of cadets within a year of 
starting classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can get the full Citadel experience without being a cadet," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Faulkner sued, five incidents of vandalism have been directed against 
her and her family -- the most recent when vandals poured sand, rotten eggs and 
spoiled food on her car.

HOUSTON MAYOR DEFENDS SLAYER

 Mayor Bob Lanier said Wednesday that a homeowner who shot a Scottish 
businessman to death after mistaking him for a burglar had a right to protect 
his property. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanier said he was "very, very sorry" that Andrew De Vries, 28, of Aberdeen 
had died after the homeowner, Jeffrey Agee, shot him last week in Agee's back 
yard.But Lanier told reporters that Texas law allows people to protect their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a person has a right to protect his home given the way things are 
these days," he said. "You don't get drunk and climb over back fences at 4 
o'clock in the morning and not expect some abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Agee, 40, an Exxon Corp. geologist, told police that he thought he was 
shooting at a burglar. He fired three shots and hit De Vries with two of them.

PROBES OF ALLEGED PAYMENTS TO SUPPRESS N.J. BLACK VOTE DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal and state prosecutors are dropping their probes into explosive 
comments that Democrats and black clergy were paid to keep minorities away from 
the polls in this state's gubernatorial election. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Michael Chertoff said Wednesday that a two-month investigation 
turned up no evidence to support comments made, then retracted, by Edward J. 
Rollins, the former campaign manager for Republican Gov.-elect Christine Todd 
Whitman. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal teams shared information but reached independent 
conclusions, Chertoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't anybody that said . . . (he) had been offered those funds," said 
George Kugler, one of two former state attorneys general appointed as special 
counsels in the state probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman, who had branded Rollins a liar, said she was relieved that the 
investigation is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I knew it never happened . . . this was the inevitable outcome," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman will succeed Gov. James J. Florio, a Democrat, on Tuesday. She 
defeated Florio by 26,093 votes out of more than 2.5 million cast, the 
second-closest margin in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins issued a statement from his Washington office Wednesday, apologizing 
to Whitman, the black community and the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the Nov. 2 election, Rollins told reporters at a Washington 
breakfast that $500,000 was distributed to black ministers and Democratic 
workers to discourage blacks from voting. On Nov. 19, he said he fabricated the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Democratic Party sued to obtain a new election, then withdrew its 
lawsuit after its own probe failed to uncover sufficient evidence of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 In sworn testimony to lawyers for the Democrats, Rollins conceded that he 
advised Lonna Hooks, the Whitman campaign liaison to the black community, to 
tell black ministers disenchanted with Florio that "as far as we're concerned 
we want to help them. Whatever their favorite charity may be, there are other 
ways of helping them besides state funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins testified that he did not authorize Hooks to commit money to the 
effort but said: "Tell them, if they don't go up to the pulpit and preach 
against us on Sunday, we'd be way ahead of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Hooks, nominated by Whitman to become secretary of state, has said no such 
conversation ever took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The furor caused by Rollins' remarks prompted a new state law requiring that 
Election Day campaign workers be paid by check, not cash "walking around 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Election Law Enforcement Commission is still looking at the way 
public funds were spent during the campaign.

WILDER WON'T SEEK ROBB'S SEAT IN SENATE, PLANS TO QUIT POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. L. Douglas Wilder said Wednesday that he will not challenge fellow 
Democrat Charles S. Robb for his U.S. Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing his final State of the Commonwealth Address, Wilder announced 
that he was leaving politics after a two-decade career capped by a historic 
term as the nation's first elected black governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage in my life I feel the need to take another direction," said 
Wilder, who turns 63 this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's dramatic announcement was reminiscent of his statement two 
years ago that he would abandon his presidential bid after four months. Wilder 
also made that announcement in unscripted remarks at the end of his State of 
the Commonwealth Address to the General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder said in June that he intended to challenge Robb, a longtime rival. But 
the governor made no effort to raise money or organize a campaign staff, and 
rumors had been circulating that he might not run. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb already faces Richmond lawyer Sylvia Clute in a June 14 primary. Retired 
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and James C. Miller III, budget chief under 
former President Ronald Reagan, are vying for the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder devoted most of his prepared speech to the accomplishments of his term, 
particularly his efforts to help blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not retired from seeking the answers to the problems that continue to 
confront us, but from seeking elective office at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder was elected in 1989 with a bare majority. His popularity slipped during 
his term, partly because of his ill-fated presidential bid and his struggle to 
balance the state's budget during the recession.

KEY ECONOMIST FLAYS CLINTON HEALTH PLAN; MEDICINE: IN SPEECH TO INSURANCE 
GROUP, STANFORD PROFESSOR CALLS FOR PRESIDENT TO ABANDON PRICE CONTROLS. HE 
SAYS DRAFT REFORMS WON'T WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's beleaguered health reform plan took another hit Wednesday, 
this time from the Stanford University health economist credited as an 
intellectual father of health purchasing alliances -- a centerpiece of the 
President's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech in New York, Prof. Alain C. Enthoven said that Clinton's plan is 
unworkable and should be rewritten. He specifically called for the President to 
abandon price controls -- a reference to the proposal to cap the rate of growth 
of insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Price controls don't and won't work, and therefore the first thing Congress 
should do is delete pages one through 1,342 of Clinton's 1,342-page bill," 
Enthoven said in a speech before the American Insurance Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthoven's criticism of the Clinton agenda is not surprising. The co-founder 
of an influential, free-market oriented club of health economists known as the 
Jackson Hole Group, Enthoven was consulted in connection with the Clinton plan 
but was not a major player in the development of it. He became increasingly 
vocal in his opposition to the proposal through 1993, both in speeches and in 
his writings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the other principal architect of managed competition -- Richard 
Kronick, on leave from UC San Diego -- was a key participant in the health care 
task force and serves as a senior Administration health policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthoven and Kronick came up with the notion of creating a nationwide system 
of purchasing cooperatives that pooled consumers into networks to buy health 
insurance at lower, group rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House Health Care Reform Task Force, under the direction of 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, has added numerous other elements to that 
concept. Among them is a government mandate requiring all employers to pay at 
least 80% of the cost of the health insurance premiums for all full-time 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kronick on Wednesday disputed Enthoven's characterization of the insurance 
premium caps. "We don't have price controls the way they are normally thought 
of," Kronick said. The main (price control) mechanism is creating a competitive 
market that works. The cap on the rate of growth of premiums is only a backup 
mechanism, an emergency brake." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its introduction last fall, Clinton's health reform plan has been 
roundly criticized by many major interest groups unhappy with some element or 
other. Such attacks have largely gone unanswered while the President has been 
distracted by other issues and controversies, much to the dismay of many 
Administration health analysts and backers of the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Many leading Republicans in Congress seem to have hardened in their opposition 
to the President's plan and even some key Democrats have begun expressing 
skepticism about the plan's ambitious nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over health care reform is expected to heat up sharply later this 
month when the President delivers his State of the Union speech and Congress 
returns to begin the task of overhauling the health care system.

HAITIAN GOURMANDS FIND THEIR PICKINGS SLIMMER AS EMBARGO HITS ELITE; CARIBBEAN: 
EVEN THE PRIVILEGED ARE NOW FEELING THE PINCH. MANY ARE FOCUSING ON A RELIEF 
FUEL SHIPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First went gasoline. Then it was the electricity and telephones. Now it's 
Baltic Mousse. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now -- and all through a series of international economic sanctions that 
have almost emptied Haiti's streets of vehicles and left the already beggared 
nation largely without power and telephones, with most of its people 
malnourished if not starving -- the country's elite had counted on maintaining 
its usual privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among them were the half a dozen or so quality international restaurants 
in Petionville, a tony suburb of Port-au-Prince high on a mountainside 
overlooking -- but distanced from -- the capital's squalor and misery. 
</P>
<P>
 And the creme de la creme of the fancy beaneries was La Souvenance, where the 
specialty was Baltic Mousse, a mixture of herring and salmon eggs served with 
chopped onions and capers, often accompanied by champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baltic Mousse is no more, finally falling victim to the latest 
international sanctions. Those were imposed in mid-October to punish the 
Haitian military and its civilian allies for refusing to permit the return of 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had been overthrown in September, 1991, 
in a violent revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people had put their hopes on a 300,000-gallon shipment of gasoline and 
diesel fuel, due here this week for distribution to international feeding 
centers, hospitals and other humanitarian agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps some of it could be siphoned off through traditionally corrupt avenues 
to those willing to pay; or perhaps even given legally to restaurants on 
grounds that they provide "humanitarian" assistance by employing people. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a chance, say diplomats and officials of the international agencies 
organizing the fuel shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 They are determined to avoid charges that they are violating their own embargo 
-- so determined that they are tightly restricting distribution of the 
admittedly small amount of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the nation's most prominent hospital will receive any. The reasoning 
is that it mostly cares for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the diplomats and other international officials acknowledge that 
probably 25% or more of the fuel will be subject to "leakage," even the most 
cynical observers doubt that any will find its way to Petionville's 
restaurants, at least not enough to keep them open for long. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a shock to an elite that easily and arrogantly found a way to 
frustrate earlier sanctions, paying huge fees for ships to smuggle in spare 
parts, French ice cream and other delicacies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Guy Barme, the owner of La Souvenance, was once heard to say with a sly 
grin, "Vive l'embargo" as he served freshly smoked Norwegian salmon, 
accompanied by a fine French white wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, standing in his restaurant, its tables adorned with wilting flowers, the 
subtle pink and gray colors of the elegant dining room darkened by a power 
outage, the French-born Barme says he is finally beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I can stay open on the weekends," he said, "but I don't know. If 
there's no power and no fuel for the generators, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 What he does know is that he can't get the fresh ingredients needed for 
something as fragile as Baltic Mousse. Neither can he count on the steady 
refrigeration necessary to protect such delicacies from the tropical heat and 
humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 The same restrictions have written finis for other posh restaurants -- La 
Voile, Cascade and Chez Gerard, all of which have closed or restricted their 
openings to one or two days on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a real loss," said the owner of a pharmaceutical company who lives in 
Petionville. "I want Aristide back, but I want to be able to go to Souvenance 
or La Voile. Why shouldn't we have something nice in our lives?" 
</P>
<P>
 For the international organizers of the boycott and the overwhelming majority 
of Haiti's 6 1/2 million people, the vanished Baltic Mousse is no loss, not 
when most of the population is out of work, has no private or public 
transportation and thus has no access to the already severely limited health 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 CARE, the American relief organization, has had to suspend most of its feeding 
operations in the Northwest, Haiti's poorest region, because of the lack of 
fuel, while Catholic Relief Services has been forced to cut back to one meal a 
day its feeding program in Port-au-Prince and other urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 With black-market gasoline selling for nearly $8 a gallon, only the richest 
can afford to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses are charging passengers $5 to travel half the distance of their old 
routes, making it nearly impossible for most students to reach their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian power company has cut output so severely that even Petionville 
goes days without electricity. Now utility officials are saying that all 
service may end within days because the only working turbine is on the verge of 
breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
 Cap Haitien, the country's second-largest city, has not had electricity for 
more than two months, and most other areas have been blacked out for even 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Several telephone exchanges have shut down; others are in such bad repair or 
so overloaded that it takes hours to get a dial tone, and that only leads to a 
busy signal. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 12 hours, from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning, Haiti was 
without outgoing telephone service: no international calls, no local calls, 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some service restored," a telephone company official said 
Wednesday, "but it could happen again. It probably will." 
</P>
<P>
 The humanitarian fuel shipment by Royal Dutch-Shell, arranged and paid for by 
the United States, will not alleviate most of these hardships. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats acknowledged that it is a gesture to offset growing criticism that 
the embargo is seriously harming Haiti's poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Distribution of the shipment, about 85% of it diesel fuel, will be restricted 
to select public hospitals, four internationally operated feeding programs and 
non-governmental water treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the shipment will be rationed to stretch it for as long as two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three hundred thousand gallons, that's nothing," one diplomat said. "It's 
about a pint a person. It's what Shell sells in two days. It'll take longer to 
hook it (the tanker) to the pipe than it will to pump it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Aristide forces here, and even some people who favor his return, argue 
that the shipment is discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you give fuel to a hospital," said Emmanuel Constant, head of the Front 
for Advancement and Progress of Haiti, a military-linked, violence-prone, 
anti-Aristide party. "What about the poor person who has no gas to drive his 
sick child to the hospital? Isn't that humanitarian as well?" 
</P>
<P>
 As small and relatively insignificant as the shipment will be, it has been 
threatened with theft and violence, armed intervention to prevent either its 
unloading or its distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it isn't distributed equitably," said Constant, who led a violent 
demonstration Oct. 11 that discouraged a U.S. military cargo ship from docking 
here, "we'll just steal it."

U.S. TO AIM MISSILES AWAY FROM RUSSIA, UKRAINE; MILITARY: ALL THREE NATIONS 
WILL TARGET FAR-OFF SEAS, WHILE KIEV WILL EVENTUALLY DISMANTLE ITS NUCLEAR 
ARSENAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States is preparing to announce that it will aim many of its 
nuclear missiles away from targets in Russia and Ukraine and point them instead 
at far-off reaches of the open seas, U.S. officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement is expected to be made by President Clinton on Friday during 
his visit to Moscow to sign a broader agreement with the other two countries 
under which Ukraine will promise to dismantle its entire nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, officials said, Russia and Ukraine will announce similar 
plans to "de-target" their own nuclear missiles away from the United States. 
The three countries have selected several ocean sites as substitute targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the action will be conditional on the signing of the accord by 
all three parties. All three governments will be required to disclose specifics 
on how the new targeting will be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is scheduled to fly to Moscow on Friday to 
join Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin for the signing ceremony. 
The three presidents also are expected to announce other steps to help reduce 
nuclear tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The re-targeting, which will affect thousands of missiles now in silos in all 
three countries, will be primarily a political gesture. Experts said the United 
States could aim its missiles back at Russian targets within 15 minutes if such 
a move was ever necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, specialists cautioned that there is virtually no way to verify 
whether the targets of the missiles have been changed, since the weapons are 
controlled largely by top-secret computer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials argued nonetheless that the step will help reduce tensions 
among the three countries by slowing the now "hair-trigger" response time for 
firing nuclear missiles. Washington and Moscow accomplished a similar end in 
1991, when they took their strategic bombers off alert. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will be another step in the gradual but steady arms reduction effort 
begun by the United States and the former Soviet Union when the Cold War ended. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce G. Blair, an analyst at the Brookings Institution think tank, warned 
that the action could have the ironic effect of increasing the pressure on 
commanders to order the launching of their missiles sooner to allow time for 
the change back to the land targets. 
</P>
<P>
 It would take about 30 minutes for a land-based Russian missile to reach 
targets in the continental United States. Some analysts have estimated that, if 
a U.S. commander had to re-target his missiles, he might not be able to launch 
before Russian missiles hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of shifting the targets was broached by Yeltsin, who announced two 
years ago that his government no longer would aim its long-range missiles at 
U.S. cities. That announcement apparently was mostly a matter of intentions, 
however. In the months since Yeltsin spoke, several top Russian officials have 
conceded that Moscow has not altered the targets that it had in place before 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at the Administration's direction, senior military officers at the 
U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha have been exploring the idea with their Russian 
counterparts over the last 18 months and have hammered out a plan that is 
acceptable to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine was brought in on the arrangement more recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the bulk of the work for the U.S. side was done by Air Force 
Maj. Gen. Robert E. Linhard, the Strategic Command's director of plans and 
policy. In December, Russian Col. Gen. Igor Sergeyev, commander of Russia's 
Strategic Rocket Forces, went to Omaha to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures compiled by the Arms Control Assn., the United States now 
has 800 intercontinental ballistic missiles, carrying 2,250 warheads, while 
Russia has 688 ICBMs with 3,880 warheads. Ukraine has 176 missiles and about 
1,250 warheads. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts said not all of these warheads will be affected. Rather, the 
re-targeting will affect only the primary targets for each country's missiles. 
Reserve targets -- mostly military sites and several for each missile -- will 
remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the agreement will not affect missiles carried aboard U.S. and 
Russian nuclear submarines. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accord to be signed Friday, Ukraine will surrender its nuclear 
weapons voluntarily to Russia for dismantling, in exchange for Western security 
guarantees and economic aid for both Ukraine and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine also is expected to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks treaty 
and to participate in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Ukrainian 
Parliament technically approved both accords last November but attached 
restrictive conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton met with Kravchuk late Wednesday at the Ukrainian capital of Kiev 
before flying to Moscow for his meetings with Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials cautioned that the re-targeting plan could be delayed if either 
Ukraine or Russia declines to accept any of the provisions in the accord or 
balks at other steps now in the works to help reduce nuclear tensions among the 
three nations.

NEO-NAZI ATTACK ON DISABLED GIRL RECALLS WWII TERRORISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reminded of the Third Reich's attempt to exterminate the physically disabled, 
Germans sought to come to grips Wednesday with a neo-Nazi attack that left a 
wheelchair-bound girl with a swastika carved on her face. 
</P>
<P>
 A private advocacy group called Help for Germany's Handicapped said the Monday 
assault on the 17-year-old in the eastern German city of Halle was not an 
isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty disabled people have reported being victims of attacks by rightist 
extremists in 1992 and 1993, said Friedel Rinn, chairman of the 
Duesseldorf-based group. One of the victims died. 
</P>
<P>
 A nationwide dragnet has been launched for the girl's assailants. But Halle 
police said they still do not know who carried out the attack in broad daylight 
not far from her school. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so disgusting that it could only have come from a sick mind," said 
Otto Regenspurger, the federal government's advocate for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinn blamed Chancellor Helmut Kohl's social policies, saying the government 
has done too little to encourage sympathy for Germany's needy and 
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 But Regenspurger blamed violent movies and television. He said the assailants 
may have been copying a recent television drama about neo-Nazis that included a 
portrayal of the same crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Halle high school students organized a march for today to protest the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Halle sent composite pictures of the assailants to investigators 
across Germany and are asking residents for help in finding the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
 City police spokesman Ralf Berger said about 60 people have called with 
possible clues but that there have been no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal justice minister says police must make a concerted drive this year 
to end neo-Nazi violence, which has killed 30 people since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Halle slashing victim told police she was stopped by two male skinheads 
and a teen-age girl just after leaving class. Identified only as Elke, the 
victim said one of the male extremists cut a swastika into her left cheek after 
she refused to repeat fascist slogans.

CLINTON SWOOPS IN LIKE SANTA WITH PLEDGES FOR UKRAINE LEADER; DIPLOMACY: THE 
U.S. PRESIDENT'S AIRPORT STOP AIMS TO BOOST THE CHANCES THAT KIEV WILL GET RID 
OF ITS NUCLEAR ARMS. 
</P>

 For a president of Ukraine, it doesn't get any better than this. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and his gleaming blue-and-white 747 swooped into Kiev's 
grimy Borispol Airport on a cold midwinter evening Wednesday, and the youthful 
leader of the world's only remaining superpower bestowed a personal blessing on 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, rattling off pledges of assistance and 
support and promises of a place in a glowing future. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the pledges added up to little new money, and Clinton's purpose was to 
boost the former Communist leader's chances of keeping his promise to get rid 
of his country's nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for the embattled Kravchuk it must have looked like Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 As if dropping in on a favored congressional candidate, Clinton pumped the 
dour Kravchuk's hand, praised him to the foggy skies and talked up the 
barrelful of rewards Ukraine will enjoy if it gets rid of its missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our meeting this evening . . . opens the door to new forms of economic, 
political and security cooperation," Clinton said at a news conference in the 
airport terminal. "We are prepared to increase our (economic) support 
substantially as Ukraine moves toward economic reform," he added, holding out 
the prospect of more than $155 million in new U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk, beaming, said Clinton's offer of aid is "very important." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said he is increasingly certain that he can persuade his balky 
nationalist Parliament to support his agreement to dismantle the more than 
1,800 nuclear warheads that Ukraine inherited from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that our Parliament will become smarter in the course of its 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The enticements Clinton offered went beyond immediate financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The President gave Kravchuk an invitation the Ukrainian has long coveted, an 
official visit to Washington -- "Blair House, red carpets, brass bands, 
everything," a White House aide enthused. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the United States is ready to act as Ukraine's sponsor -- 
"Ukraine's godfather," as an aide put it -- in international organizations that 
control much larger amounts of aid, including the International Monetary Fund 
and World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 And Administration officials said the pact will help ensure Ukraine's safety 
from domination by neighboring Russia -- by opening the way to military 
cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and by strengthening 
Kiev's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk has promised several times to get rid of the nuclear arms on his 
territory, but the Ukrainian Parliament has demanded both financial 
compensation and guarantees of protection against Russia before a firm 
agreement can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference was broadcast live on Ukrainian television, and White 
House aides said one of Clinton's main aims was to influence the Ukrainian 
public in favor of the pact, which is to be signed in Moscow on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Clinton's arrival, in Kiev's Parliament and its streets, reaction to 
the agreement was skeptical. But for the first time, there were some positive 
notes too. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some things (in the pact) that could possibly be good for Ukraine: 
guarantees of borders, sovereignty and financial compensation," said Serhiy 
Holovaty, a moderate nationalist leader in the Parliament. "If these three main 
conditions are satisfactorily met, I will judge it as a success." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need economic development. Why do we need missiles?" asked Irina 
Lesovetskaya, a retired physician. But she added that she is concerned that 
Russia will not keep its promises to compensate Ukraine for the uranium it will 
give up in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some nationalists remained firmly in opposition. As Clinton walked into 
the airport terminal, a band of about 30 demonstrators chanted "Clinton, go 
home!" and "Kravchuk, resign!" 
</P>
<P>
 "A belligerent Russia is not the place to give nuclear weapons away," said 
Ivan Lozovy, a Ukrainian-born New Yorker who was one of the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accord, Ukraine will agree to eliminate its nuclear weapons over a 
period of time that officials said will be less than seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Ukraine will receive $1 billion worth of nuclear fuel for civilian 
reactors, representing the equivalent of the high-energy uranium in the nuclear 
warheads it is giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Russia will forgive much of Kiev's debt to Moscow as compensation 
for the short-range nuclear weapons Ukraine gave up in earlier years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, both the United States and Russia will affirm their 
commitments to respect Ukraine's existing borders, including the Crimea, which 
is claimed by Russian nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's offers of new economic aid included the possibility of doubling $155 
million already promised this year, plus roughly $20 million from a new fund to 
help start private enterprises in several former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the nuclear deal is being kept secret, White House officials said, in 
part to keep the details out of the hands of Kravchuk's opponents while the 
Ukrainian leader tries to gather support. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk himself was careful not to be too explicit about what he is promising 
on Ukraine's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ukraine will be committed to its obligations," he said. "Ukraine will not be 
the state that prevented disarmament." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said they are confident the Ukrainian's ambiguities did 
not signal any desire to wriggle out of the pact but merely reflected the fact 
he is still selling the accord in private talks. 
</P>
<P>
 He has told U.S. officials that he plans to bypass the current Parliament and 
wait until a new one is in place after elections in March. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holovaty predicted that the strategy will fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't ignore this Parliament," he said. After the election, he predicted, 
"It won't get any better." 
</P>

U.S. EXPERTS VOICE HOPE ABOUT RUSSIA; REFORMS: TREASURY OFFICIALS EXPRESS 
OPTIMISM AS HYPER-INFLATION SLOWS. INTERNATIONAL LOANS, CREDITS AND GRANTS ARE 
CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As President Clinton begins his first official visit to Moscow, his 
Administration views the coming days as a make-or-break period for the massive 
reform being undertaken across Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a critical juncture for the Russian government," Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen said here after a day of private meetings with Russian leaders 
and diplomats from the Group of Seven nations. "Major decisions are being made 
in the next few days." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to the political and economic turning point at which Russia 
finds itself in the aftermath of last month's parliamentary elections, which 
gave rise to an ultranationalist wing under the leadership of Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky, and to current attempts to form a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Treasury officials who preceded Clinton to Moscow -- the President 
meets today and Friday with President Boris N. Yeltsin -- were unusually upbeat 
about the prospects for long-term reform and about the current state of 
Russia's chaotic economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by an inflation rate down from roughly 30% a month -- bordering on 
hyper-inflation -- last spring to the current rate of about 12%, officials 
spoke optimistically, if vaguely, about reaching agreement with their Group of 
Seven aid partners on a program of further support. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of leading industrial democracies is currently administering a 
$43-billion program of loans, credits and grants, about half of which have been 
disbursed. No major new U.S. program is anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake, one senior Treasury official said, is whether Russia will continue 
to develop a market-oriented economy or revert to the central government 
control that prevailed under communism. U.S. officials are watching to see at 
what pace privatization proceeds, how the government budget deficit is tackled 
and whether the flow of central bank credits to industry is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear whether a reshuffled Cabinet will lead Russia in a decisive 
new direction or will continue to swerve between such stringent economic 
reforms as ending government support for unprofitable businesses and keeping 
the subsidies flowing to hold down unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in the icy darkness of the Moscow morning after an overnight flight 
from Washington, Bentsen led the advance party for the Clinton Administration's 
most sensitive international economic foray to date. He met with Anatoly B. 
Chubais, the deputy prime minister responsible for the government campaign to 
convert the economy resulting from seven decades of state-controlled communism 
to a market-oriented one based on private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's task of driving the Russian nation through this unguided 
intersection clearly has Clinton Administration officials energized -- and 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 In their view, the economy now is in better shape than in the past to 
withstand the rigors of shedding inefficient state-supported industries. But 
even more than in the past, there is anxiety about whether the Russian people, 
fearful that the reform process will leave them literally out in the Russian 
cold, will go along. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the economic situation in Russia is better than it is widely seen," 
said a senior Treasury official who has spent much of the past year monitoring 
developments here. "The privatization has made substantial progress." 
</P>
<P>
 By U.S. count, 40% of the employees in Russian industry are working for 
companies that are now part of the private sector, and 70% of the employees in 
small retail operations are working for private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, is not to suggest that the largest economic challenges have 
been met: 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial production has fallen deeply -- partly as a result of the drop in 
the manufacturing of military hardware but also due to reduced output in 
non-defense areas. The value of the ruble in relation to the dollar has been 
unsteady, and it is uncertain whether a recent stabilization will hold. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though inflation has fallen sharply from a mind-boggling rate of 
2,500% a year, it is still running at nearly 300%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding just like his colleagues in Washington whose domain is the U.S. 
federal budget, the senior Treasury official said: "The key to the Russian 
economy is the Russian budget. What Russia needs is to make less resort to 
inflationary finance" -- the printing of rubles to meet the budgetary needs of 
inefficient state-run enterprises -- while still spending money to help 
pensioners and to fund unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are reluctant to predict when the next budget will be completed 
-- a wariness born of their own experience pushing a budget through a Congress 
more compliant than the Parliament that Yeltsin faces. But they say it is one 
of the crucial tasks facing the post-election government now being formed. 
</P>
<P>
 One private analyst in Washington who has spent 30 years studying the Russian 
economy estimated that roughly $10 billion -- about 7% of Russia's gross 
national product -- will be needed for unemployment insurance for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 During their meetings with Yeltsin, the senior Treasury official said, the 
U.S. officials will focus on specific programs of U.S. and international 
support for economic reform; efforts to tailor those programs to meet Russia's 
social-service needs, and trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
 And they will review problems in existing aid programs, including those 
created to make nearly $700 million available in loans to develop energy and 
for unemployment assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans include $70 million in World Bank funds for Russian employment 
projects built around closing inefficient factories whose subsidies drain the 
national budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The international funds are available, but they have not been drawn upon 
because there is a lack of agreement in Russia's government on how to design an 
unemployment program. There is some concern in the government that such outside 
support creates the impression that Moscow is yielding to Western pressure to 
throw people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen on Wednesday announced the appointment of Michael Gillette, a senior 
World Bank staff member, to head a group intended to push such support through 
the Russian pipeline -- a position that Clinton and Yeltsin agreed last April 
must be filled speedily. 
</P>
<P>
 As the winter has progressed, the United States has found itself at odds with 
international funding agencies over how closely to link financial aid to 
progress in economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 As reforms to make industries more efficient bring increases in unemployment, 
which is officially listed as 1.5% but is believed by private analysts to be 
closer to 10%, U.S. officials have called for relaxation of the strict 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a representative of an international financial institution in Moscow 
said in an interview that Russia's needs meant that it could not be held to the 
same standards applied to other nations when they seek loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Characterizing the problem as "the 'Jurassic Park' syndrome," he said: "A zoo 
is a zoo, but it's a lot more difficult to manage when the animals are 
dinosaurs than when they're zebras, tigers, giraffes. That's what distinguishes 
Russia from Ghana, Bolivia."

U.S. AID IMPROVES FEW RUSSIAN LIVES; ASSISTANCE: HIGH EXPECTATIONS AMONG 
ORDINARY CITIZENS GO UNFULFILLED. TECHNICAL HELP IS SLOW TO BEAR FRUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Army Lt. Alexander Maly, a 22-year-old platoon commander, is about to benefit 
from the Clinton Administration's multibillion-dollar effort to reform Russia. 
As far as Maly's concerned, it's about time. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years in a cramped dormitory, the lieutenant is No. 36 on a waiting 
list for the 128 free apartments in a twin-tower high-rise, one of six housing 
projects being built with U.S. aid for officers slated to be discharged from 
Russia's shrinking army. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as planned, in July he and his wife will move into a new 
three-room apartment overlooking a lake in an upscale neighborhood of the city 
of Nizhny Novgorod. Then he will leave the army and try to launch his own 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little doubt that the young couple will get their promised new life. 
The $6-million pilot housing program, announced when President Clinton first 
met with President Boris N. Yeltsin in Vancouver, Canada, last April, is moving 
along more or less on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Clinton and Yeltsin begin another summit meeting today, it is one of 
the few examples of American aid with a promise of immediate payoff for 
ordinary Russians. And even this program is minuscule compared to the 
expectations it has raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, the United States has given Russia 
more than $4 billion in direct assistance, much of it technical aid that will 
be slow to bear fruit. It has also orchestrated a $43-billion Western aid 
package to be channeled mostly through international financial agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslav V. Kostikov complained on the eve 
of Clinton's arrival that the aid effort pales next to the Marshall Plan 
launched by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every family felt that aid," Kostikov said in an interview. "In Russia, on 
the other hand, there is not yet a single family that can say, 'Yes, the 
Americans helped me and made my life better.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The housing program launched last spring was designed to meet such criticism. 
It was based on a simple formula: Russians have timber, cement and newly 
private construction companies; Americans have money and know-how; together 
they can help close Russia's deficit of about 10 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In its initial phase, the program is designed to satisfy another mutual goal 
-- the reduction of Russia's army and the withdrawal of the 20,000 troops still 
based in the now-independent Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Riddled by poor morale, the army has balked at bringing home former Soviet 
officers from foreign bases or discharging them from the service until it can 
provide them with homes of their own in Russia. Maly and other officers have 
been brought back anyway, only to wind up in the dormitories or barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Their frustration boiled over last month when army officers gave a 
disproportionately high vote to Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, whose neo-fascist 
party finished second in Russia's parliamentary elections last month. The 
result shocked Yeltsin's reformist government and the West not only because of 
Zhirinovsky's views and militarism but because of his opposition to dependence 
on Western aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zhirinovsky promised to give higher salaries and quality housing to 
servicemen who live in ghastly conditions," Maly said, explaining why he and 
his army buddies voted for the extremist. "He may not be able to fulfill those 
promises, but a sweet tale is still better than the bitter truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The lieutenant was quick to add that he welcomes the American promises as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot be ashamed," he said. "Our country needs to be saved. Clinton has 
extended a hand of friendship, and we should take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials now worry that the hand of friendship is too little, too 
late. They are pressing Washington to launch a promised expansion of the pilot 
project, which is building 460 homes and apartments in five cities, into a 
$160-million effort to finance homes for another 5,000 army officers by 
October, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the project had been launched a year earlier, fewer servicemen would have 
supported Zhirinovsky," said Anvar Shamuzafarov, secretary of a government 
committee coordinating the building project with the U.S. Agency for 
International Development. "The longer we delay, the more we help the 
extremists who want to wreck the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. AID officials defend their decision to start small. They note that the 
pilot program, due for completion this summer but delayed until fall, exposed 
flaws in planning that would have been costlier had they launched from scratch 
into mass production. 
</P>
<P>
 One lesson they learned was to write contracts to accommodate Russia's high 
monthly inflation. Contractors demanded payment in advance, then charged AID 
extra when the materials they bought turned out to cost more rubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another lesson was to pay more attention to politics in choosing where to 
build. The Siberian city of Novosibirsk pulled out of the project after forces 
hostile to reform took power in City Hall in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project was considered too Yeltsin, too American," said an AID official, 
who was forced to find new sites for 180 single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot project's latest experiment is to give 100 army officers vouchers 
worth about $15,000, the approximate cost of a 700-square-foot home, to pay 
directly to contractors to build whatever they want. If the system works, 1,000 
of the officers benefiting from the expanded program will receive vouchers, 
while the other 4,000 will be assigned homes built by AID. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials, while accepting the voucher system, worry that it will 
drive up housing prices; the Americans hope it will cut out the bureaucracy and 
stimulate competition in the housing market.

WILL EXTREMIST MEET CLINTON? NOT IF DIPLOMATS CAN HELP IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and his ill-named Liberal 
Democratic Party racked up their huge share of party votes in the recent 
parliamentary elections, the Clinton White House has fretted about how to 
handle the fiery extremist when the President comes here for his summit meeting 
with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Zhirinovsky's supporters added to the Americans' consternation 
by spreading the word that he would attempt to crash a scheduled reception at 
the U.S. Embassy for Clinton to meet "opinion leaders" in the former Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 That raised the specter of some kind of nationally televised confrontation 
outside the embassy, because U.S. officials were determined to stick to their 
policy: No invitation, no admission. They also were not about to undermine 
Yeltsin's precarious political position by giving even an indirect American 
blessing to Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, diplomats have found what they hope is a solution to their problem: 
They have invited Alexei Mitrofanov, a Liberal Democratic member of Parliament, 
to attend the reception tonight. The guest list also includes several 
Communists, as well as young entrepreneurs and figures from the world of 
Russian art and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 And the diplomats have come up with what they hope is an acceptable 
explanation for passing over Zhirinovsky himself. Clinton, they are saying, 
wants to meet with "the next generation" of Russian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House may not quite be out of the woods yet, though. One U.S. 
official said there is some concern that the wily Zhirinovsky might show up 
himself bearing Mitrofanov's invitation.

U.N. REPORT ON AIR STRIKES IN BOSNIA DUE; BALKANS: BOUTROS-GHALI ORDERS THE 
STUDY. NATO HAS THREATENED TO USE AIR POWER, BUT ISSUE REMAINS CONFUSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an atmosphere of doubt and ambiguity, U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday ordered a top aide to prepare a report in the next 
five days on the possible use of NATO air power to break rebel Serb 
strangleholds in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali's decision on whether to authorize such air strikes -- and the 
procedure for ordering each one -- apparently will be made after the report is 
taken up at a high-level U.N. meeting in Geneva on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general ordered Yasushi Akashi of Japan, his highest-ranking 
civilian official in the Balkans, to make the report after this week's NATO 
threat to use air power to relieve Canadian peacekeepers in Srebrenica, open 
the Tuzla airport for humanitarian supplies and stop the bombardment of 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning came at the end of a summit of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole issue has been clouded, however, by widespread skepticism over 
NATO's resolve and confusion about how any order would be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a Security Council resolution passed last June, the final authority for 
ordering air strikes appears to lie with Boutros-Ghali. But there is a good 
deal of ambiguity about the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 To complicate matters further, the secretary general reportedly has been 
angered by the attitude and remarks of Gen. Jean Cot of France, commander of 
U.N. forces in the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cot has argued in interviews that the military command -- not a civilian such 
as the secretary general -- should make the final decision on any air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments, according to Reuters news agency, prompted Boutros-Ghali, long 
wary of any use of air power in Bosnia, to send Cot a letter of reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva, U.N. spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said that Akashi, the secretary 
general's special representative for the former Yugoslav federation, will 
present his report to Boutros-Ghali at a Monday meeting that will be attended 
as well by Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway, the co-chairman of the Bosnian peace 
conference, and by Marrack Goulding, the undersecretary general for political 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In its June resolution, the Security Council said that NATO, "under the 
authority of the Security Council and subject to close coordination with the 
secretary general" and the U.N. peacekeeping force, "may take . . . all 
necessary measures, through the use of air power" to support the peacekeepers 
in their mission. 
</P>
<P>
 On the basis of this resolution, Boutros-Ghali later told the council that 
"the first decision to initiate the use of air resources in this context will 
be taken by the secretary general in consultation with the members of the 
Security Council." 
</P>
<P>
 It has never been clear whether Boutros-Ghali intended to simply inform the 
council of his decision or to seek its approval. 
</P>
<P>
 This presumably will be cleared up after the Monday meeting.

ISRAELI GENERAL KILLED IN COPTER CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The commander of Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank and three other 
officers were killed Wednesday when an army helicopter crashed while landing at 
a base outside Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Nehemiah Tamari, 47, was believed the highest-ranking officer to die 
in the occupied territories and at least the third general killed in the line 
of duty.The crash was an accident, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamari, who took charge of what Israel calls the Central Command a year ago, 
was on his way back from a late-night flight to the Jordanian border. 
</P>
<P>
 He was investigating a suspected infiltration attempt, which turned out to be 
false, a military source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial investigations indicated there was poor visibility at the landing pad 
at the army's Central Command headquarters.

AUDITOR SAYS 2 UC EMPLOYEES MISUSED $40,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two former University of California employees misused more than $40,000 in 
state and local funds, including at least $12,680 that they put to personal 
use, the state auditor says. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor said the former director and administrative assistant of the 
Student Opportunity and Access Program at UC San Diego were involved in the 
improper activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Student Opportunity and Access Program is designed to help low-income and 
minority students go to college and to assist community college students in 
transferring to four-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the investigation were referred to state and federal authorities 
for possible use in criminal and civil proceedings, the auditor said in a 
report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the former employees, who resigned during the probe, was named in 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
 State auditors said the director misappropriated more than $6,000 by writing 
checks to herself and her husband from a secret, unauthorized bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative assistant made personal use of more than $6,585 by 
falsifying payroll documents, forging signatures on payroll checks and forging 
the program's endorsement on checks from other organizations, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the report released Tuesday also said that: 
</P>
<P>
 * The director and administrative assistant submitted false payroll forms to 
generate money for the petty cash fund and to make authorized payments to 
student employees, who allegedly cashed the payroll checks, kept $20 to $25 and 
gave the remaining cash to the director. 
</P>
<P>
 * The director told her staff to submit at least $10,956 in false mileage 
reimbursement claims to obtain money for unauthorized uses, such as payments to 
students, petty cash and food. 
</P>
<P>
 State Auditor Kurt Sjoberg said his investigators concluded that at least 
$12,680 of the $40,000 went to the director and administrative assistant. He 
said he did not know how much of the rest of the money benefited the two 
officials.

GAY SUPPORT MEETINGS ON CAMPUS OKD; EDUCATION: TRUSTEES VOTE TO ALLOW SESSIONS 
TO CONTINUE AT FOUNTAIN VALLEY HIGH. NEARLY 100 PEOPLE ARGUE THE ISSUE BEFORE 
THE HUNTINGTON BEACH DISTRICT BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After hours of spirited debate before nearly 300 people, trustees of the 
Huntington Beach Union High School District voted late Tuesday to allow a gay 
student support group to continue meeting at Fountain Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and students, critics and supporters filled the school board meeting 
room, fiercely debating values and gay rights. Nearly 100 people delivered 
arguments to the board, ranging from biblical quotations to testimonials about 
the value of teen-age support groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation," said board member 
Jerry Sullivan, who introduced the motion to allow the club to continue meeting 
at the school. The vote was 4 to 1, with Trustee Dirk Voss opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attending the meeting ranged from Christian conservatives who have 
called gay support groups part of a national effort "to overhaul straight 
America," and gay rights advocates who viewed the vote as a leap forward in 
fostering understanding of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1984 federal Equal Access Act, whenever a student group is allowed 
to meet on campus, other groups must be afforded the same privilege. All but 
four of Orange County's 27 school districts have adopted equal-access policies 
allowing student groups to meet on campus before or after school or at 
lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 At the school district meeting, the audience divided like wedding guests, with 
critics on one side of the room and supporters on the other. A contingent of 
gay students from the EAGLES Center, a Los Angeles Unified School District 
program for gay students, filled the front rows. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old girl stood before the board and described herself as a senior 
who intended to graduate from the EAGLES program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how anybody can say we're doing anything wrong," said Christina 
Grant. "I am doing very good at EAGLES. I am going to UCLA. . . . My father is 
a Republican and a Christian and he still loves me," she said, to the applause 
and cheers of supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Natalie Ballard said, "I have a gay child and I just came here to say I 
understand how scary it is to be in school and have no one to support you. I 
think everyone wants that support." 
</P>
<P>
 Many critics of the equal-access policy laced their comments with religious 
references. 
</P>
<P>
 Ina Brinkmann, wearing an "I Love Jesus" button, presented the trustees with 
120 signatures of people opposed to the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love is big, but homosexuality is wrong," she said, pledging to gather 
hundreds more signatures from her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said earlier Tuesday that he opposes "groups that are sexually oriented 
that are on our campuses. I don't feel that it's appropriate. It clearly 
violates our state education code . . . standards regarding sexual education. 
It's a slap in the face. . . . It clearly undermines the rights of parents to 
be in control of their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Public debate has raged since the gay support group known as the Fountain 
Valley High School Student Alliance began meeting on campus in October. 
</P>
<P>
 In past weeks, school district officials and trustees have been deluged with 
letters and telephone calls from people on both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay activists and gay alumni of Fountain Valley High turned out at a December 
board meeting and pledged their support for gay students and the equal-access 
policy. That session was attended by more than 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and students vehemently opposed to the gay support group, meanwhile, 
have held demonstrations and charged that allowing the group to meet promotes 
an immoral lifestyle.

EARLY BREAST-FEEDING CUTS CANCER RISK, STUDY FINDS; RESEARCH: THE LONGER THAT 
NURSING CONTINUES, THE BETTER THE CHANCES THAT PRE-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN CAN AVOID 
BREAST MALIGNANCY, RESEARCH SHOWS.

 The longer that mothers breast-feed, and the younger they begin, the more they 
lower their risk of getting breast cancer before menopause, a large study has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 It found that a woman who begins breast-feeding in her teens and continues for 
at least six months cuts the cancer risk almost in half. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found no evidence that nursing prevents the disease from occurring 
after menopause. Breast cancer before menopause is relatively rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for those who began nursing in their teens, the reduction in risk was 
generally small, about 22%. The finding is still noteworthy because 
breast-feeding represents one of the few voluntary things that women might do 
to change their odds of this cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in the past have wondered about the possible effects of 
breast-feeding, but the data has been murky. Some earlier studies linked 
nursing with reduced cancer risk, while others found no correlation. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest study was directed by Dr. Polly A. Newcomb of the University of 
Wisconsin and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of reasons to breast-feed," Newcomb said. "First and 
foremost is to provide the child with complete nutrition and psychological 
benefits. But a woman might also consider the possibility that this could 
reduce her risk of breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 Her study was based on a review of 5,878 breast cancer patients in Wisconsin, 
Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire. Their nursing habits were compared to 
those of 8,216 women who did not have breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that a woman who begins breast-feeding before age 20 and 
continues for at least six months cuts her risk of breast cancer before 
menopause by 46%. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers estimate that if all women with children breast-fed for at 
least two years, the incidence of breast cancer before menopause would fall by 
nearly 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of death among women.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: MEN'S CLUBS BECOMING JUST A PART OF THE PAST?; 
LIMITED-MEMBERSHIP GROUPS ARE FINDING THAT AGE, TIME AND COMPETITION IMPOSE 
LIMITS OF THEIR OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently, my 6-year-old and his friend started speaking a new language. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds Asian," I told my husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, my son is a terrific kid who goes to a terrific school and has a terrific 
teacher and a terrific friend. But even I, his greatest fan and most fervent 
admirer, would find it an impossible notion that my youngest child had gone and 
taught himself Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 What he and his best pal were engaged in was something that males, formally 
and informally, have been doing for centuries: creating a limited-membership 
social order with its own language, rules and, sometimes, eccentric look. In 
other words, a fraternal organization. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as we all know, this isn't something just for youngsters. Men of all ages 
have traditionally felt the need to hang with one another, just as women have 
always sought out the company of other women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys have always liked to sit around, smoke nasty old cigars, tell dirty 
stories and itch where it scratches," said Pancho Doll, who wrote this week's 
cover story. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, they used to. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Doll, attrition and fewer men rushing to sign up are grievously 
affecting many local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess nowadays there are fewer people, male or female, who want to be in the 
room with stinky cigars, rude scratchers or socially incorrect jokes. Or is it 
simply that for many men the clubs have outgrown their usefulness? 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these organizations began in a time when consumer protection and 
product warranties were unheard of," Doll said. "So your brother Mason or Elk 
was a reliable source of goods and services. You saw him every week at the 
lodge, so there was accountability there." 
</P>
<P>
 And nowadays, we not only have the warranties, we have the products that go 
with them -- TVs, VCRs, compact discs -- all the things we associate with home 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result is that now we're getting less of our entertainment in the form of 
face-to-face contact," said Doll. "All of our electronic stuff has supplanted 
old-fashioned conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 The most important factors explaining the waning interest in many clubs may be 
social and economic, judging by the success of Moose International Inc. That 
organization is reaching out to families, not just their senior male members, 
and is growing both nationally and locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shared parenting and two-income families have changed our patterns of 
association," said Doll. "Now guys put on a funny hat for the kid's birthday 
party."

RELUCTANT NOVICE: SNAKEBOARDING: IT'S SIDEWALK SURFING FOR YOUNG AND RESTLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN McALPINE, Ken McAlpine is a Ventura freelance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your youth you were a righteous dude. As a gawky pre-teen you terrorized 
neighborhood streets on a skateboard -- your parents terrified you would slam 
into a parked car, the neighbors terrified that car would be theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly older, you surfed your way around the globe, the highlight of your 
oceanic quest coming when, at a remote Indonesian reef break, you jumped out of 
a boat and nearly landed on the back of a shark. Young and reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, these days you are neither. 
</P>
<P>
 Which explains, in part, why you are standing in a parking lot, rooted to the 
spot, arms swinging back and forth, trying to eke the remotest semblance of 
movement from the strange gadget beneath your feet. The gadget is shaped like a 
skateboard gone anorexic in the middle: two foot plates -- each underlain with 
a pair of wheels -- connected by a narrow bar about a foot long. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheels are designed to roll, but these wheels are spitting in the face of 
physics. 
</P>
<P>
 This fact is not lost on Brandon Eifrid. Eifrid is a snakeboard instructor, 
and he has kindly agreed to give you a lesson. Like any good instructor, Eifrid 
possesses two invaluable character traits -- patience and a poker face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget to move your feet," he says, watching you swing your arms back 
and forth like a discus thrower mired in glue. "Put your toes together, then 
your heels together. Toes together, heels together. That's what moves the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
 For folks who don't watch MTV, don't own baggy pants and think "big air" is 
something that happens after eating too much chili, snakeboarding may require 
some explanation. Snakeboarding has actually been around for about four years, 
ever since a young South African surfer and skier named James Fischer, bored 
with conventional skateboarding, came up with a design that has two foot plates 
pivoting on either end of a stationary bar. By placing one foot on each 
footpad, then twisting his upper body and rapidly moving his toes in and out in 
a sort of pigeon-toed moonwalk, Fischer found he could mimic the motion of a 
surfer on a wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like surfing on land," Eifrid, a surfer, tells you. "You can really 
carve." 
</P>
<P>
 In surfspeak, carving denotes radical, intentional changes in direction on the 
part of the rider. Adept snakeboarders can do this and more. Eifrid provides 
you with a videotape that proves this is so. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tape, snakeboarders, backed by driving rock music, hop benches and 
launch themselves off ramps, over barrels and down stairs, getting big air and 
then landing upright with a flashing display of braces. Eifrid swears that 
people over 20 snakeboard, though you don't see many of them in the video. Top 
riders can attain pavement-warping speeds of 28 m.p.h. Eifrid himself has been 
clocked at 18 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, however, you aren't going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with patience and a stone face, Eifrid has a passing knowledge of 
neurology, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The brain's not used to doing two major things at once," he says, watching 
your arms swing back and forth while your legs remain stone. "Maybe you should 
just concentrate on your feet." 
</P>
<P>
 This is precisely what you are doing, but your legs, which can work a 
surfboard with some degree of proficiency, aren't cooperating. In refusing to 
budge, they may actually be a step ahead of your brain, having already made the 
distinction between water and concrete. Besides, your brain, at the moment, is 
chewing over a particularly ugly skateboarding accident from years ago in which 
you jumped from the skateboard at 20 m.p.h. and took steps the size of Kansas 
before landing on your face. 
</P>
<P>
 You pose the question that's uppermost in your mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I get hurt doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eifrid pooh-poohs the notion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had an accident on the thing, not a single scrape," he says, 
snaking about the parking lot to prove so. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion is fluid and graceful, a sidewinder whipping its way quickly across 
the road. What Eifrid doesn't point out, and what you both know, is you're not 
Eifrid. Which is why you remain as rooted to the firmament as a sidewinder that 
didn't quite make the asphalt dash. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any good teacher, Eifrid focuses on the positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're twisting your upper body really good. Move your feet a little more and 
you'll be moving. Heels in. Toes out." 
</P>
<P>
 You shuffle your feet. The snakeboard budges slightly, then, just as suddenly, 
comes to a halt. Eifrid is excited, perhaps sensing he'll now be home before 
nightfall. When you met Eifrid at 9 this morning, he told you that most 
beginners achieve crude movement in about 10 minutes. Now Eifrid is only 
minutes away from missing lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was it right there," he says. "Did you feel the board move?" 
</P>
<P>
 Only the most sensitive seismic device could have detected movement, but you 
lie anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that felt great. I really think I'm starting to get the hang of it," 
you say. Eifrid nods, equally enthusiastic about engaging in this lie. "Now 
that you've got the movement down, it's only a matter of time," he says. "Just 
relax and let it flow." 
</P>
<P>
 This would be easier had a busload of school kids not just pulled into the 
parking lot. They are all between 10 and 14, snakeboarding's target audience, 
and before the bus squeaks to a halt, they are up in their seats, faces against 
the glass. Eifrid snakes about, and an excited buzz travels along the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 They watch you execute your cautious palsy with the thick silence kids reserve 
for hopeless dolts. You wish the driver would tell the little hoodlums to get 
back in their seats. "There, that was nice and smooth right there," says 
Eifrid, interrupting your thoughts. "No doubt about it, you're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed you can now travel a discernible distance. The motion is hardly fluid 
-- more like the final spasms of some great, dying beast -- and inevitably it 
ends in a jolting stop. But the particulars aren't important. Progress is 
progress, and you are making it. 
</P>
<P>
 Eifrid and the buzzing school bus fade away. Your world becomes a narrow strip 
of concrete, and the feel of the snakeboard moving tentatively under your feet. 
Something familiar is happening here. Eventually you realize what it is. You 
are having fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Eifrid is smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get the basics down, you've just got to keep doing it," he says. 
"It's like an addiction. And the longer you do it, the better you get." 
</P>
<P>
 Truer words were never spoken.

NIGHT LIFE: BARNYARD BE-BOP; SPACEY ROOSTER RA SOUND REFLECTS THE ECLECTIC 
TRIO'S DIVERSE INFLUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rooster Ra is nearly as hectic as a basic day in the barnyard with Foghorn 
Leghorn, the chicken hawk. The eclectic trio will be doing three gigs this 
weekend: Saturday at 2 p.m. at Java Heaven in Ojai; Saturday night with the 
improvisational Mahacuisinarte at Nicolby's in Ventura; then a Sunday night gig 
at the Midnight Hour in Ventura, where they'll be joined by the always trippy 
Ojai band Brilliant Daydream. 
</P>
<P>
 No lawyer is likely to call Rooster Ra and tell them that another band already 
has their name. And certainly, no other band sounds like this Ventura trio, so 
I wouldn't look for a Rooster Redux cover band anytime soon. Their spacey songs 
shift gears more times than a kid with his first car. This is 
stream-of-consciousness coffeehouse fare that Maynard G. Krebs would've dug. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's enchanted tribal lounge music," said singer-guitar player Ray Waggoner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naw, it's Jimmy Page meets Ghandi," said drummer Mitch Velasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our songs are a billion ways of saying the same thing; we are one," said 
bassist Sundance Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooster Ra began as a duo with Waggoner and Velasquez playing in coffeehouses. 
They were performing the occasional Gig From Hell while looking for that 
elusive bass player and their first dancing patron. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, we opened for this punk band called Arch Enemy at the Mayfair 
Theatre," said Waggoner. "The place was totally packed, and there was the two 
of us on this big stage and the whole place is going 'Bleep you! Bleep you!' We 
played about 20 minutes then got off the stage. When Arch Enemy took the stage, 
the crowd was yelling the same thing at them, so I guess it wasn't just us." 
</P>
<P>
 The band went through about 10 bass players before settling on Erickson, who 
also plays flute, about six months ago. With staffing taken care of, there is 
just the problem of funds. They've got a new tape to sell, which is live 
recordings from a couple of local coffeehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we sell three, then we make 10 more," said Erickson. "We'd like to make a 
new tape every two months or so because the songs are always changing, always 
evolving." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be willing to take donations from anyone who sees fit to support this 
enterprise," said Waggoner. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent gig at the Midnight Hour, the first thing one noticed was the 
smell, which wasn't like lunchtime with the Colonel, either. This was sort of a 
cross between sweaty feet and eucalyptus. Actually, it was sage incense being 
burned to set that groovy tone before the band played. Sage is only groovy if 
you think Vick's smells good. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, the band cruised through a lengthy set with their usual herd of 
invisible dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The local scene is pretty limited for us, so we usually end up playing at 
21-and-over places, like barrooms," said Erickson. "Our music actually goes 
over better in a coffeehouse where music is the thing, and not drinking. But 
even when we're playing at a total meat market, the crowd still absorbs 
something. Even some drunk guy at the bar will look up and hear something. I 
think it affects you more when music sneaks up on you rather than beats you 
over the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "We attract a really diverse crowd. We get some old people that are really 
clean-cut who like our classical side. But basically it's just people who want 
to be healed and hear something real." 
</P>
<P>
 Waggoner is the primary songwriter, but everyone participates in this 
democratic experiment with a beat. The experimental nature is clear from the 
band's diverse influences: Miles Davis, Peter Gabriel, King Crimson and the 
Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do compositions classically, then approach it with be-bop standards," said 
Waggoner. "I bring in skeletons, then we all just take our turns with it. We 
have about 25 songs right now, and a lot more in the works. We never do the 
same song the same way twice, and there's always extended jams. We're a punk 
band in disguise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Band members and clubs come and go. In Downtown Ventura, the Bermuda Triangle 
went away on New Year's Eve. Expect the Midnight Hour and Nicolby's Upstairs 
Pool Hall & Night Club to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolby's used to be Zenon West, then it was Mogz -- both were under-age 
places -- before it became an antique store. Now it's a state-of-the art pool 
place with a big stage, great sound system and all kinds of exotic brewskis. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming biggies here include those Ska Daddyz on Jan. 21 and ska madness from 
Carpinteria's Upbeat on Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The Midnight Hour has been open since June, has survived some financial 
difficulties and now seems on solid ground. They were the last venue to get 
pool tables and they always have local bands on the CD player. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming biggies include Mr. Ectomy, Cubensis and Constant Llama on Saturday 
night and Led Zepagain and Rude Mood on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Locey, who writes regularly on rock 'n' roll, has survived the mosh pit 
and the local music scene for many years.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: RHYTHM RANGERS IS A BAND WITH PLENTY OF POWER; HIGH-ENERGY 
ROCKABILLY AND R&B GROUP WILL RECORD A LIVE ALBUM DURING A GIG AT MAXIE'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN LOEWENTHAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're lookin' for a fun time this weekend dancing to lots of original and 
cover country, rockabilly and blues tunes, Maxie's in Oak View is the place to 
go. The Rhythm Rangers, a jumpin' high-energy local country and R&B band, is 
planning to record a live album during its gig Friday night. And they want fans 
to help make it a dynamic event. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet chose Maxie's because it's where the current lineup got its start 
about four years ago. And they have a loyal following that packs the place 
whenever they return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider ourselves a live band -- we're a working band. And we'd like to 
get some of the cuts on the album live," said band leader Michael J. Smith. "We 
want it rowdy as can be 'cuz we get the energy from the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Griffin, owner of Dolphin Studios, a recording studio in Ventura, will 
handle the live remote and masters. Cassettes and CDs should be available in 
six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith isn't kidding when he calls the Rhythm Rangers a "working band." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the original group was formed in 1981, the band has earned a 
well-deserved reputation for versatility -- a skill no doubt honed on the 
wedding and Bar Mitzvah circuit and by gigs ranging from hotel lounges and 
biker bars to the Ventura County Fair and annual California Beach Party blowout 
in Ventura. And don't forget six years on the road touring lumberjack bars in 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "Live Rangers: Long, Hard Road," the album's working title, was not chosen 
lightly. Smith didn't mention ever playing behind protective chain-link 
fencing, but his war stories from the road included a logger named Rockie who 
pulled the door off a police cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, with 20 years experience under his belt, plays guitar and harmonica for 
the band. He switches to the bass when he and fellow band member Craig Newton 
pick up extra gigs as the Rhythm Rangers duo. Smith and Newton (guitar, 
keyboards, flute, mandolin and lead vocals) also collaborated on the original 
tunes to be included on the album. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our newest one, 'The Dancer,' is a waltz about eternal love," said Smith. " 
'A Girl Like You' is an up-tempo swing tune with harmonica. 'Wheels' is a truck 
driver song with Eddie Rabbit influence. And 'No More Lonely Days and Empty 
Nights' has three-part harmonies like the Eagles." 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Louie Louie (Nilson) also does lead vocals. And according to Smith, 
"Louie's the only one who can play that two-four country train beat and also 
play a simple, solid rock drum." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and bass player Alan Drettler go back to the '70s together. "I was a 
drummer then," recalled Smith. "And we worked with Canned Heat, Albert Collins 
and Luther Tucker." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides playing and composing, Smith's professional experiences during the 
last two decades motivated him to become more active in the business side of 
music. And after serving as vice president of the Ventura County Musicians 
Union, Local 581, he was elected president on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole charter as union president is to promote live music," said Smith. "I 
want to bring free-market, capitalistic principles into unions. Musicians have 
to market themselves to overcome self-entertainment like karaoke, line dancing 
and deejay music. You've got to make the venue want to hire you 'cuz you'll do 
extra things to bring in people and make the owners some money." 
</P>

 As you may have noticed, swing is getting almost as popular as the two-step.

Two Steppin' column for courses starting today. Page 7

SOUNDS: AUSPICIOUS TIMING; STRUNZ AND FARAH RIDE A TIDE OF WORLD MUSIC'S 
BURGEONING POPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jorge Strunz and Ardeshir Farah represent the sound of two acoustic guitars 
operating in high gear. They dish out sensuous melodicism and knuckle-busting 
guitar technique over pulsating Latin rhythms, much to the delight of a growing 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is no overnight-sensation story. 
</P>
<P>
 Strunz hails originally from Costa Rica, and Farah from Iran, and they met on 
the neutral turf of Los Angeles nearly 15 years ago. Strunz had just left his 
Latin fusion group Caldera to return to the acoustic guitar of his musical 
upbringing. The pair embarked on a mutual musical adventure, building a 
reliable, if modest, cult audience for their dizzying guitar handiwork and 
Latin-Middle Eastern hybrids. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, come the '90s and the release of their albums "Primal Magic" and the 
more recent "Americas," Strunz and Farah found themselves airlifted into 
another strata of popularity and fame. Now, the group -- which will play at the 
Ventura Theater on Jan. 22 -- is on the verge of launching its own label under 
the auspices of Rhino records. 
</P>
<P>
 Auspicious timing and persistence paid off. In the last several years, world 
music has come into its own as a viable corner of the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also new age "Nouveau Flamenco" phenomenon Ottmar Liebert, whose 
immense popularity has no doubt helped to fuel interest in the Latin-tinged 
acoustic guitar textures that Strunz and Farah employ. On the subject of 
Liebert's watered-down Flamenco music, Strunz has mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 A rare musician who is articulate both in person as well as on his instrument, 
Strunz spoke in an interview last week about his duo's continuing saga. 
</P>
<P>
 How does it feel within the group -- have you hit a stride artistically to 
coincide with your market success? 
</P>
<P>
 It feels very good. As you can imagine, it's gratifying after playing for so 
long and committing ourselves as wholeheartedly all our lives to the guitar to 
be able to arrive at a music that pleased a large number of people. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a challenge, in and of itself, to maintain that at this point. You're in 
competition with yourself, which is always a difficult position to be in. 
</P>
<P>
 How does the collaboration work? Is it an East-meets-West kind of a liaison 
between you two? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it certainly has been that, although we've been together since 1980. So 
this is our 14th year as a duo. We've gone through a lot of different 
manifestations, in terms of the cultural blending. Right now, I would say that 
we've been emphasizing the Latin-American rhythmic aspect of the music. That's 
proven to be popular with the people. Still, I give Ardeshir full reign as a 
soloist to put whatever melodies he feels are appropriate on top of that. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitar, of course, has a long history. Flamenco is one of its strongest -- 
possibly still its most developed -- form. That's a southern Spanish music with 
a lot of Gypsy influences that has a long history into the Middle East. It's a 
mixture of Middle Eastern and Celtic and Latin music that has evolved in Spain 
for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Was guitarist John McLaughlin a catalyst for the both of you? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he was certainly an inspiration to both of us -- no question of that. 
He's been very supportive of our music so he's been both a spiritual support 
and an actual, hands-on supporter of our music. We're delighted that he does 
appreciate what we do. Both he and Paco de Lucia support us, and we feel 
honored that people of that caliber enjoy and respect what we're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 We saw Paco play in Anaheim a couple of months ago. He's always such a 
gentleman and he was saying he's so happy to see us more successful and that 
our music was gaining greater acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 He did express some concern, however, that certain other guitar players -- who 
shall remain nameless -- were giving Flamenco a bad name. He said that was a 
source of concern for him, and that he was here, among other things, to set the 
record straight as to what Flamenco really is. 
</P>
<P>
 You're speaking, now, of Ottmar Liebert. 
</P>
<P>
 But, you know, I mean, all power to him. To me, I'm delighted that people like 
Hispanic and Latin guitar and I suppose for a lot of yuppie buyers, it's safe 
Latin Guitar. It doesn't require translation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it's not the real thing. It's a sad substitute for a very rich 
tradition. But, maybe it will serve to introduce people to other things. I 
certainly wish him well, because it doesn't hurt us in any way, shape or form, 
that I can tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you have any idea that it would last this long? 
</P>
<P>
 No. I knew that the music that I was envisioning was going to be good for more 
than one record, because the traditions were so huge and the resources were 
massive. The colors available were unbelievable, so I knew that if we could 
make ends meet, there would certainly be no dearth of inspiration and ideas for 
the instruments themselves.

WORDS & IMAGES: THE BATTLE OF THE BOOKSTORES THREATENS TO SPREAD TO OJAI; 
IRONICALLY, EARTHLING BOOKSHOPS, FIGHTING THE CHAIN STORE BATTLE IN SANTA 
BARBARA, IS VIEWED AS THE INTERLOPER IN THIS CASE.

 Independent bookstores are locked in deadly combat with chain stores like 
Barnes & Noble, Bookstar and Crown, who are opening mega-stores all over the 
country, usually within walking distance of successful independents. 
</P>
<P>
 The chains insist there is room for everyone. The independents claim they are 
struggling to keep their doors open. Independents claim that it is not a level 
playing field because the chains are able to buy from publishers and 
wholesalers at deeper discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ironic twist, a bookstore war may be developing in Ojai between the 
small Table of Contents and the independently owned Earthling Bookshops of 
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. When news spread through Ojai that Earthling 
planned to open in the vacated Bank of America building on Ojai Avenue, some 
locals sent angry letters of protest calling Earthling a large enterprise that 
has no place in their town. The irony is that Penny and Terry Davies, 
Earthling's owners, who considered themselves under siege by the newly opened 
Barnes & Noble super-store in Santa Barbara, are now themselves perceived by 
some in Ojai as chain store interlopers. We hope that the booksellers of Ojai 
and Earthling's owners will work out a plan that will benefit everyone.

REWIND; A FEW CLIMBING FILMS THAT RISE ABOVE 'CLIFFHANGER' ON THE REALITY SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that "Cliffhanger" has hit the video stores, it's high time for a look at 
that and other cinematic "peak experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester Stallone's movie may have realized gross receipts of $80 million, 
but climbers focused on its gross implausibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 From this climber's point of view, however, there are any number of better 
choices: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Eiger Sanction" (1975), with Clint Eastwood starring and directing, for 
instance, still offers some of Hollywood's most convincing climbing footage, 
both in its early training sequences and later on the legendary north face of 
the Eiger in the Swiss Alps. 
</P>
<P>
 "K2: The Ultimate High" (1992) proved more successful as a play with dialogue 
focusing on character development and the relationship of two climbing partners 
in the face of potentially fatal crises. The Pakistani mountain setting -- 
presumably K2, the second tallest peak on Earth, but actually Mt. Waddington in 
British Columbia -- and relatively thrilling climbing sequences save the film 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 Released as part of a National Geographic "Great Explorers" box set this year, 
"Return to Everest" documents the 30-year anniversary of the historic climb of 
Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. The documentary traverses, says 
the narrator, "not only the great landforms of Earth, but a less visible 
geography, the private landscapes of (Hillary's) passage through the years," 
including the death of his wife and daughter in a plane crash, his son Peter's 
near-fatal accident in the Himalayas, and a reunion with Norgay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mountain" (1956) is long on heart, short on realism and mostly just plain 
hokey, but Spencer Tracy is always great to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Other films set in the peaks or involving climbing to a lesser extent include 
"Lost Horizon" (1937), "North by Northwest" (1959), "For Your Eyes Only" 
(1981), "Five Days One Summer" (1983), "Shoot to Kill" (1988) and most 
recently, and featuring the best plane crash ever and great moral dilemmas to 
boot, "Alive!" (1993).

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; PICKING MOVIES CAN BE A TRYING WORKOUT; CARD 
CATALOGUES LIKE THOSE USED IN LIBRARIES MAY BE A SOLUTION FOR CROWDED SHOPS, 
BUT THE COVER ART IS HOW MANY PEOPLE DECIDE THE ONE THEY WILL RENT, STORE OWNER 
SAYS.

 Ever feel like your spinal health limits the videos you watch? 
</P>
<P>
 With so many titles crammed into small stores, retailers are forced to use all 
the space on their display racks, right down to the floor. That means simply 
picking out a film involves any combination of squats, toe touches and lunges. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke Bradbury of Giant Video in Santa Paula is one store owner who feels space 
restraints acutely. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 4,000 square feet of area and 13,000 movies, we're stuffed to the 
gills," Bradbury said. "But we haven't had any complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 One alternative to video crowding is card catalogues like libraries have, but 
Bradbury said the cover art is how many people pick the video they are going to 
take home. So unless commercial rental rates decline and floor space expands, 
you're still going to have to wear exercise clothes to read all the titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Jones of Simi Valley takes the practical approach. Said the 220-pound 
chain smoker: "Picking out movies is about the only exercise I get. That and 
coughing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Production crews for the "Indiana Jones Chronicles" are in Fillmore and are 
expected to begin filming the made-for-TV movie shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 John McKinnon of the city's film commission said the picture will be set in 
the 1920s, which is why Fillmore was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the challenge was looking for buildings and offices that haven't been 
modified," McKinnon said. "The offices at the lemon packinghouse by the 
railroad tracks on A Street will be part of it. Those interiors haven't been 
altered in 70 years. It's very difficult to find interiors that have been 
well-maintained for that long." 
</P>
<P>
 Other sites to be filmed include the Masonic Hall on Central Avenue, Fields 
Aircraft Spares (originally the Fillmore-Piru orange packinghouse), the 
exterior of Fillmore High School and the school administration building. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers have already employed 10 to 15 local residents in administrative 
jobs. McKinnon said they will also be casting extras, a job that pays $50 a day 
plus lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the production are reluctant to disclose how much they will 
contribute to the local economy because they are still in negotiations with the 
owners of several venues for the rights to film there. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller production last year in Piru added $40,000 to local coffers after 
spending less than half the time that "Indiana Jones" has scheduled for 
filming. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A pair of middle school teachers are miffed at Jim Salzer, the owner of 
Salzer's Video, for displaying mature videos on the main floor of his store. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to The Times, Jerry and Sharon Mittelholtz said they were shocked 
late last year when they found titles like "Becoming Orgasmic," "Best Chest in 
the West," and "Ultimate Kiss -- A Sensual Guide to Oral Lovemaking," on 
general display. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked Salzer to move the offending titles to the adult section where 
minors are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused, saying he isn't going to make people who have an interest in 
improving their sexuality go to the pornography section of his store. Video 
stores, he countered, are being picked on by the traditional-values crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's censorship. If you look at magazines like Cosmopolitan and Mademoiselle, 
they have the same sort of stories on their covers and they are right there in 
the supermarket checkout aisle."

STRUCTURES; SERENE PRECURSOR TO MAYAN AUDACITY OF ROBERT STACY-JUDD; KROTONA 
INSTITUTE SHOWS ANOTHER SIDE OF THE ARCHITECT KNOWN AS AN ICONOCLAST AND AN 
EXPONENT OF THE OUTLANDISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Krotona Hill is a peaceable property, detached from the township of Ojai 
proper, occupying a sprawling space all its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestling into the Krotona Institute of Theosophy's library, housing more than 
10,000 books mostly on spiritual and metaphysical topics, the visitor peers out 
of the tall, arched window to the lawn and rose garden out front. 
</P>
<P>
 Vistas of the Ojai Valley beckon below. Squirrels scamper on the spacious 
grounds, where deer and coyote have also been known to roam. Apart from the 
drone of traffic drifting up from California 33, it's feasible to imagine the 
hill as a rural retreat. All is right with this world. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for architectural observers in the area, a question persists: Can the 
70-year-old structures that are the heart of the place really be the work of 
the same man who flung quasi-Mayan and Art Deco motifs together for such 
edifices as the First Baptist Church in Ventura? 
</P>
<P>
 British-born Robert Stacy-Judd, who died in 1975 at the age of 90, had an odd 
reputation in the annals of Southern California architecture -- somewhere 
between genius and self-styled iconoclast. The architect's work and legend has 
recently been revived and re-examined in David Gebhard's new book "Maya 
Architecture: the Creation of a New Style" (Capra, $30). 
</P>
<P>
 What we see in the First Baptist Church, at the corner of Santa Clara and 
Laurel streets, is one of the more audacious edifices in the county. Built 
between 1928 and 1932, the church represents the fruits of Stacy-Judd's abiding 
interest in Mayan architecture and design. 
</P>
<P>
 He championed the Maya style, although he saw few of his Mayan-oriented 
buildings go up, and went on to write archeological volumes on the Maya and 
Atlantis. These books can be found, aptly, at the Krotona library. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to believe, in a sense, that, during the same year that Stacy-Judd 
worked on the Mission-style Krotona Institute, he was devising his 
attention-grabbing Aztec Hotel in Monrovia. With the Aztec, what had begun in a 
Pueblo style took a radical turn as Stacy-Judd doused both its exterior and 
interior in Mayan relief. 
</P>
<P>
 National attention, both positive and negative, followed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai, it's a different story. What we see in the architect's several 
buildings at the Krotona Institute of Theosophy -- primarily the library and 
the Esoteric School building -- is calm, restrained and respectful of the 
general lay of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't the Krotona's first landing spot. Named after Crotona, a 
Pythagorean school in Italy, the Krotona Institute of Theosophy was settled in 
Hollywood in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
 As congestion and the Babylonian boom-town mentality of the movie industry 
grew in the '20s, the Krotona Institute migrated to the more idyllic locale of 
Ojai in 1924. The 118-acre Krotona property, purchased with funds from 
Theosophy founder Annie Besant, was originally an almond orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing legacy of the late religious leader Krishnamurti and, by 
association, the Krotona Institute, represents an important piece of the 
cultural puzzle of what has made Ojai Ojai. And the structures comprising the 
Krotona Institute, especially the cornerstone of the library (open to the 
public), survive as a graceful home to resident arcana. 
</P>
<P>
 The library is a multifaceted structure, finished in pieces in 1924 with 
additional work by Santa Paula architect Roy C. Wilson. Especially effective 
are the meeting room, graced by a picture window, and the central library, with 
its reading room surrounded by overhead balconies. 
</P>
<P>
 True to Stacy-Judd's culture-bending tendency -- even back in his relatively 
sedate pre-Mayan period -- the library itself isn't quite as staid or 
stylistically homogeneous as it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 First impressions upon entering the library are deceiving. Contrasting with 
the earthy warmth of the Mission style elements, the lobby, lined by cold 
marble walls, conveys a curious, tomb-like ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 Enigmas lurk here. Once, a fountain, now removed and covered over with an 
ornate rug, trickled in the center of the room. One arched door leads to 
nowhere, providing only symmetry with another door across the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 A regular, geometric grid of tiles in the lobby make for a stark contrast with 
the jagged piecework of the sidewalk outside. The architect has explained the 
difference as symbolizing the tranquillity of spiritual life versus the chaotic 
nature of worldly reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is a composite, run-on affair inviting exploration. 
Rear-projecting wings flank a courtyard out back, with ascending paths on 
either side of long, cascading fountains. Flowing water greets the ears and 
calms the nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the road from the library, Stacy-Judd's E.S. (Esoteric School) 
structure is eerily reminiscent of another well-known Ojai building, albeit of 
a secular nature: Wallace Neff's original Ojai Country Club. Like Neff's 1928 
clubhouse, if with less organic beauty, thickly stuccoed walls sit beneath 
red-tiled roofs. The composition is deceptively simple. 
</P>
<P>
 The rambling building shows a sculptural integration of rectilinear volumes 
capped off by a scrolling, curving staircase at one end. Stacy-Judd couldn't 
help but sneak in a subtle touch of Mayan decor, in a relief design over the 
west-facing doorway. For the most part, despite the eccentric touches, 
Stacy-Judd was on his best vernacular behavior here. 
</P>
<P>
 In focusing on the familiar Southern California Spanish/Pueblo vocabulary of 
gentle, rippling arcades, red tile roofs and lathered stucco walls, Stacy-Judd 
kept with a common architectural theme in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 While the architect ultimately became known for more outlandish creations, the 
serenity of this early work shows a more sensitive aspect of his talent. One 
can only speculate what he might have created on this hill a few years later, 
after his Mayan obsession and subsequent notoriety had flowered. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands now, Stacy-Judd's Krotona work is interesting both on its own 
terms and as a gentle shard in the strange mosaic of the architect's saga.

PROFILE; A CRASH COURSE ON TRAFFIC-SCHOOL INSTRUCTOR'S LIFE; COP TURNED TEACHER 
LORI TURNER ENTERTAINS AS WELL AS LECTURES TO TEACH VIOLATORS THEIR LESSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The woman who needed traffic school the most flunked before class even got 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a loud knock at the door as everyone settled in for four bleak hours 
of instruction about bad attitude on the road. It was a Ventura cop, seeking 
one of the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there a problem?" asked the instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there is a problem," the cop replied. 
</P>
<P>
 The student the cop was seeking, sent to traffic school for a low-grade moving 
violation, had shown some difficulty in driving to traffic class. Or maybe 
parking was her problem. In any event, she'd crashed into three cars parked 
outside before finally docking her own and reporting to class. 
</P>
<P>
 "She thought she was going to 'take care of it' on break or something," says 
an incredulous Lori Turner, the class instructor, in recalling the incident. 
"She was just not all there." 
</P>
<P>
 Most traffic school students are all there, however, even if yet another one 
arrived for class completely drunk. ("Well, I just got her out of there and 
home safely," says Turner. "Who can figure?") 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, on the face of it, has the worst teaching job around. 
</P>
<P>
 Her students have all been caught breaking the law, have paid more than $100 
to plead guilty and now have altered their work and life schedules to sit in 
cold plastic chairs beneath fluorescent lights for eight hours of instruction 
on such scintillating topics as proper merging, deciphering right-of-way and 
knowing when to cross the double yellow line. 
</P>
<P>
 They arrive annoyed, held hostage to the threat of being reported to their 
insurers. Their mood is made worse, often, by the additional assessment of $36 
for the class -- this on top of traffic court fees already paid. A simple 
U-turn approaches the $200 mark. They take their seats, most with long faces 
and some with resentment. To say they're ready to learn at this point is to 
suggest that buying a bridge in Brooklyn is quite a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Lori Turner, traffic school instructor to more than 20,000 Ventura 
County lawbreakers over the last 12 years. Former Santa Barbara cop. Mother of 
two. Bedrock Midwesterner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, there are so many horror stories out there about traffic school," she 
concedes. "I mean, I wouldn't exactly be an up person if I had to come here, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things she'll do is show a 1950s cartoon, "Motormania," in 
which a very proper, upright Mr. Wheeler becomes a complete monster when behind 
the wheel. Your basic Jekyll and Hyde. Like so many in the class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like me," Turner will tell her students. "The truth is, I was a Mrs. Wheeler. 
I've been there." 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly Turner has the class laughing. One student insists her brother was 
arrested in 1959 for driving barefoot -- this despite the absence of state 
statutes against the practice. "Yeah?" asks Turner, handing over a 600-page 
manual of driving laws. "Tell you what. I'll buy you a lobster dinner if you 
find the code." 
</P>
<P>
 Scowlers in the plastic chairs are smiling. Yes, they will be treated, at the 
close of the first night, to the classic movie "Red Asphalt II," a 
less-than-you'd-expect-given-what-you've-heard collage of bloody crashes. But 
for the most part, Lori Turner has spent the night instructing and entertaining 
not on driving minutiae but on that most vexing of human subjects: attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result she has turned a miserable crowd into civil subjects at worst and 
engaged students at best. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She got the idea to enter law enforcement back home in Indiana. She'd been 
brutally attacked -- that her jaw was broken is one of the few details she 
recalls of the incident. But she does recall her handling by male police. It 
was chauvinistic, less than sensitive, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me think: 'There ought to be more women in law enforcement.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She received a bachelor of science degree in criminology at Indiana State 
before becoming an intern with the Santa Barbara Police Department, which 
ultimately would hire her and send her on a quick upward career path. She went 
from writing traffic tickets to becoming a specialist in collecting evidence at 
accident and crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was a turning point for the young, idealistic Turner. It blunted her 
expectations, taught her harder lessons still. "You lose your naivete," she 
says. "You're in the middle of tragedy all the time. You become so aware of how 
cruel the human race can be." 
</P>
<P>
 She would later become the SBPD's training officer for new recruits. That was 
OK, except for some of the John Wayne types who were taken out of their game by 
being guided by a self-effacing, funny woman who used brains instead of brawn 
to make her point. ("It's not enough to be good," says Turner of being a woman 
cop. "Everybody's testing you.") 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Lori Turner is remembered in Santa Barbara as being "one of the 
vanguard" among women who changed the dynamics of the department, said Capt. 
Greg Stock. Stock should know: He was Turner's training officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lori had a lot on the ball," he says. "She competed and earned everything on 
her own. Since we didn't really have many women back then, she stood out more, 
and that's hard to do -- to stand out while doing the same job as everyone 
else. But she did it well, and so she is important for having shown the way for 
women who are here today." 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of service, she just felt burned out. The opportunity came to 
teach traffic school. She started out and soon retired from the force. Among 
other things, it let her have more time at home with her two children. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also let her keep a hand in doing the right thing, of serving the 
public somehow. Or "sort of" serving, as Turner qualifies it, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the second and final night of traffic school, Turner has made it clear to 
her students that she believes much madness rides our highways and streets. 
Specifically, she assigns this fact to a strange disorder suffered by the 
majority of drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The disorder? "Being first," she says. It's not about technique or competence 
behind the wheel, though some of the students' tickets would suggest that. 
Instead it's about the rush to get ahead of the next guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the most outrageous things in the name of being first," she says. 
"What's wrong with being second?" 
</P>
<P>
 Turner pauses a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so inexperienced at waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 If the students of Tri-County Traffic School, particularly those in Lori 
Turner's class, learn anything, it's to wait. Indeed, it's Turner's object 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that for students of Lori Turner, the eight-hour wait before 
hitting the exit door goes by reasonably fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the students) are good people," she says, "and I think they know I 
feel that way." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: You can't really choose to go to Tri County Traffic School. But if you 
live in Ventura County and have earned yourself a traffic ticket in the county, 
the county court will decide whether you qualify for school -- which means you 
must not have received a ticket for which you attended school in the previous 
18 months. The court then notifies you automatically if you qualify, assigning 
you to Tri County Traffic School. Here's where you do get some choice: you can 
take the requisite 8 hours of instruction one-shot, on a Saturday; or in two, 
four-hour midweek evening classes held at locations in Simi, Ventura, Thousand 
Oaks, and Agoura. Fee: $36, which includes the certificate you must submit to 
the county as proof of graduation. Information: (800) 640-3244.

FASHION; DRESSING BACKWARD IS A TREND THAT'S GOING TO PRESS FORWARD; CURRENT 
FADS INCLUDE GARMENTS WITH THE SEAMS PROTRUDING, PRODUCING THE POPULAR 
INSIDE-OUT LOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WILLIAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One function of clothing is to express protest. This was first discovered by 
the Chinese many years ago, when they successfully brought looser underwear to 
the masses by staging the Boxer Rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trend was not fully developed until modern times, when almost everyone 
under 30 got into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Defiant dressing may be overt -- such as wearing slogans so rude that people 
cross the street to avoid the wearer -- or passive, including our topic for 
today: reversed attire. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologists are no doubt tracking this trend and will one day publish their 
conclusions. But, the fashion-conscious have long seen the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans have a longing to wear their clothing backward. 
</P>
<P>
 This first surfaced in the '50s, when teen-age girls braved stern dress codes 
to slip on their cardigan sweaters with the buttons down the back. Never mind 
the pain of pearl buttons pressed against school desk chairs -- it was worth 
it. Youth was making a fashion statement, ahead of its time. 
</P>
<P>
 The urge showed up again not long ago. A wave of reversed baseball caps 
appeared on thousands of people who have never worn a catcher's mask, and 
wouldn't know one if it fell on them. Young males began the gesture, but were 
joined by their sisters and mothers, the less bold of whom turned the caps 
sideways. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the movement faded; but the craving to turn accessories around 
lived on. Women, bent on asserting their autonomy, took to wearing their 
necklaces backward. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a subtle ploy as protests go, and has failed to shock most of the 
population. So, the quest for deviant dressing continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the human form being what it is, there are few items of clothing that can 
be worn backward without interfering with bodily functions. But youth invented 
another means of breaking tradition: They turned their clothes inside out. 
Campuses were filled with young people looking as though they had dressed 
rapidly in dark closets. 
</P>
<P>
 But designers had learned to prowl around youth hangouts such as libraries and 
nightclubs and pick up clues. Soon, this seam-forward look was in the stores, 
ready-made. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, it won't go away. Current fashions have dozens of outfits with 
seams protruding like badly sutured scars, some in patchwork squares of 
stitching extending all over the garment. 
</P>
<P>
 And this look is spreading locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a whole rack of 'inside-out' sweaters; it sold out very fast," said 
Claudia Zeledon at The Broadway in Ventura recently. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, Karen Hicks, manager at Splash Fashions, also said the style 
is popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's in because of the times -- it has that recycled look," was her 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, we cannot predict how far this impulse will go. We can only assume 
that it will stop short of formal and boudoir wear; but, who knows. Designers 
themselves are not without their rebellions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, it seems, are those to whom the nation looks for fashion leadership. 
Recently photographed wearing her pearl choker clasp-forward was: Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 One would have thought if anyone were satisfied with her role in the status 
quo, it would be America's First Lady. Apparently, not so. 
</P>
<P>
 In her case, we're glad that when discontent reached the point of protest, 
reversed attire was there to fill the need. The White House is no place for 
blunt remarks on T-shirts.

SHOP TALK; NOW COULD BE RIGHT TIME TO BUY COMPUTER; IT'S A BUYER'S MARKET. 
COMPETITION AMONG MANUFACTURERS IS FIERCE AND THE PRICE RANGE BETWEEN MAJOR 
BRANDS HAS NARROWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Last month Comp USA, one of the leading computer chains, opened a store at 
Oxnard's Rose Avenue shopping center. It didn't get the attention Walmart got 
when it opened there, but the computer store's arrival sure seemed to please 
local computer folks. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the store's presence makes it any more palatable to plunk down a 
couple thousand dollars on something you can't drive or live in. It just 
provides more from which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 This might be a good sign for those of you computer illiterates out there who 
have been waiting for just the right time to take that plunge into the computer 
world. Not only is there more selection locally, but the computer market in 
general is in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great time to buy computers," said Jerry Reiter, a salesman and 
technician at Computer Village in Ventura. "The industry has probably doubled 
over the last six months to a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Reiter said prices between rival computer makers, such as Macintosh and IBM, 
are far more competitive than they once were. Macs used to be substantially 
more expensive than IBMs. Also IBMs are closer in price to their clones than 
they ever have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, before you go running off on your high-tech journey, we thought we'd give 
you some basic shopping tips, without getting too technical. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer shopping is no easy task. You probably figured that one out yourself. 
Like buying a car, a house and other investment items, purchasing a computer is 
not to be rushed into. First, sit down and figure out a few things before 
shopping around. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are your computing needs? Define your short-range and long-range needs," 
said Bob Barbabella, owner of Data Connections in Simi Valley. "Then determine 
what computer is going to meet those needs. A lot of people have no idea and 
they are going to want to find a computer store where the people are 
knowledgeable and will take the time to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 We took Barbabella's advice and checked out a few shops. Generally everyone 
was friendly enough. People at the Good Guys, Circuit City, and Comp USA were 
all willing to help and to answer questions they must have heard a thousand 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that concerned us, however, was that we asked the same technical 
questions of different salespeople and got different answers. People tended to 
be more knowledgeable about computers at stores that specialize in computers. 
If you're a first-time buyer that can be critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes things aren't what they seem. And sometimes it's hard to tell what 
things seem to be anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to know what you're buying. Know what's inside the box," said 
Barbabella. "If there's no name on a car and you can't look under the hood, you 
wouldn't buy it. But people do that all the time when dealing with a computer. 
We tell people you don't want to be penny-wise and pound-foolish. Rarely, 
rarely, rarely is the lowest buy the best deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the decision process is determining which computer system to go with: 
IBM (or versions of it) or Macintosh. Reiter has a simple answer for people who 
ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask them what they're going to be using the computer for. If this is their 
first time with a computer and they have no knowledge, I recommend Mac. If they 
have knowledge and they are going to be using it in business, I recommend IBM. 
I wouldn't let someone sell you on a monstrous machine if all you're going to 
do is write letters." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the overwhelming choices out there, computer technology is 
changing so rapidly that the machine that is "in" today may be old stuff 
tomorrow -- or sooner. There's that fear -- for first-time buyers in particular 
-- that by the time you learn how to use the equipment you're about to 
purchase, it already will be obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could sell you something and a half-hour later something new is on the 
market. It's no different with cars or TVs," said Reiter. "I recommend people 
buy a higher-end computer over a lower-end computer because they might not 
outgrow it as quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the older versions won't work. Many older computers can handle the 
faster software available today. But there are many that can't. Barbabella said 
it is important to find a machine that can be upgraded if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 When you feel like you're ready to hit the stores, grab a few local 
publications and check out the computer ads. At some point -- probably sooner 
than later -- you'll have to balance your computer needs with how much you can 
afford to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everything is on sale somewhere these days and many older computer 
systems have dropped in price. These ads are nice to have in hand when you 
visit stores, because many local shops, Comp USA and the Good Guys among them, 
will often offer to match advertised prices. 
</P>
<P>
 A final word of advice: You will probably want to consider shopping at a store 
where assistance by phone or in person is available, should something go wrong 
with your machine. It's nice to know you can get help when necessary.

FOR THE KIDS; A MONUMENT TO ART OF PLAY IN SANTA BARBARA; ABOUT 4,000 
VOLUNTEERS PITCHED IN TO HELP BUILD KID'S WORLD, AN ENTRANCING ENVIRONMENT FOR 
YOUNGSTERS TO FROLIC IN.

 Being a parent, you may think that you already know a thing or two about 
playgrounds. But have you seen one with a finger maze carved out of wood? Or 
chimes for plinking? 
</P>
<P>
 Trek up to Santa Barbara and witness Kid's World, a new 8,000-square-foot 
playground in old, stately Alameda Park. Playground isn't really the right word 
here. It's a monument to the art of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Kid's World is also a monument to the people of Santa Barbara, because they 
are the ones who built it recently. About 4,000 volunteers pitched in their 
time, skills and money to put up the wooden structure in just five days. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a gigantic, multilevel piece of architecture that kids can race 
through, climb over, play hide-and-seek in and just explore. It has little 
slides, big slides and circular slides. It has ropes for climbing and wiggly, 
bouncy walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 On a warm day just before Christmas, what seemed like 100 or so kids and 
parents cavorted noisily on the playground, and it didn't seem crowded at all. 
</P>
<P>
 In the center is sort of a mini-amphitheater that serves as a good spot for 
parents to sit and watch all the activity around them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have this in every school -- kids need this," said Judy 
Litschell, a mother and Santa Barbara child-care teacher who was there with her 
elementary-age students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need the non-competitive play situation," she said. "And there are so 
many ways to test body skills. This is child's work. They need to do this, not 
watch TV, not sit in chairs." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the playground emerged more than a year ago when city officials 
began looking at the play equipment in local parks and realized that much of it 
badly needed upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chamber of Commerce decided to work on Alameda Park," said Paula 
Cavagnaro, a chamber employee who eventually coordinated the volunteer labor on 
Kid's World. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Leathers, an Ithaca, N. Y., architect who has designed about 800 
playgrounds around the country, was hired to design the structure, she said. 
But he didn't do it alone. A design team composed of Santa Barbara kids helped 
him get it right. 
</P>
<P>
 With donated labor, materials and equipment, the project cost $180,000, money 
that was raised by the community. "Kids collected money from lemonade stands," 
Cavagnaro said. People who wanted to make a donation could "buy" a piece of the 
park or, perhaps, have their child's handprint imprinted on tile columns at the 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, with its turret-like caps and massive wood feel, has the look 
of professional craftsmanship. That's because so many of the volunteers were 
skilled laborers and contractors, Cavagnaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The playground has a number of safety features, she said. The ground is 
covered with wood chips to cushion falls. Corners and sharp edges are encased 
in rubber. Railings are high enough to make it difficult for kids to climb over 
and fall. Wiggly balance beams are only inches off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those efforts, one mother pointed out a problem. The playground is so 
large and filled with so many spots for kids to crawl into that it's hard to 
keep an eye on them, especially when the place is packed. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be one reason lots of parents that day were cavorting all over the 
playground themselves. But there is enough to interest them as well. 
Mechanical, walkie-talkie-like devices let kids and parents converse across the 
playground. The finger maze is a test not only for kids, but adults too. So is 
the marble maze, a series of little troughs for marbles to roll through. 
</P>
<P>
 A big attraction is a gizmo kids can grab onto and glide across a wire and 
back again. Others are the life-size whale and shark models for climbing over. 
</P>
<P>
 There are playthings and swings for toddlers. Bigger kids can crowd onto a 
tire swing and spin around until they get dizzy. Nearby are picnic tables and 
restrooms. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Kid's World, a gigantic outdoor play structure. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Alameda Park, at Santa Barbara and Sola streets, Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: The park has picnic tables and restrooms. Adjacent to Alameda Park is 
Alice Keck Park, worth visiting for its gardens and pond.

COVER STORY: TIME TAKES A TOLL; FRATERNAL LODGES FACE A BLEAK FUTURE AS MEMBERS 
GROW OLDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If baldness weren't enough to remind the men of Oxnard Masonic Lodge No. 341 
that their membership is rapidly aging, two of the newest inductees make the 
point. They're both morticians. 
</P>
<P>
 Members joke about the occasional hearse parked in the back of the lodge, in 
the same way as they kid one another about hair loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty years of life has left Harold Colen with no more than a fringe of hair 
surrounding his dome. For this his brother Masons call him "Curly." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got a haircut yesterday," Colen said, defending against yet another 
bald joke. "It cost me $10." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because the barber has to spend so much time hunting for hair to cut," 
retorted the jokester. 
</P>
<P>
 Aging membership is not entirely a laughing matter. Many fraternal orders such 
as Masons, Elks and others are facing declines that threaten the existence of 
the lodges, many of which have been integral parts of their communities for 
most of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say we were within two or three months of closing," said Wayne Spitzer, 
manager of the Oxnard Elks Lodge. Spitzer staved off the shut-down recently by 
renting out an adjacent building the lodge owns, but he sees the handwriting on 
the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there will be such a thing as fraternal organizations in 15 
years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has more than two dozen lodges representing six different 
fraternal orders, from the well-known Elks to the low-profile Eagles. As many 
as 12,000 people belong to these clubs. The Masons have five temples here while 
the less well-attended Odd Fellows have halls in Ventura and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 What is at risk is more than just a place for men to enjoy lunch and a game of 
cards. Their benefit barbecues pay for Little League uniforms, steak dinners 
fund health screenings for children and bingo games buy food for the needy 
during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time in Oxnard that if you didn't belong to the Elks, you were 
missing out on a big part of the community," said former Oxnard Mayor A. Elliot 
Stoll. "They had programs to distribute food at Christmas, supported youth 
bands and baseball teams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Elks still distribute Christmas baskets as they have for more than 
60 years, although the service is not without difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran a request for food donations in 'The Moo.' That's the club newsletter," 
Spitzer said. "We got maybe three cans of corn and a can of peas." In lieu of 
donations, bingo proceeds bought food for the holiday baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership shortfalls are not so easily resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk into any of these lodges and the smell of Barbasol is unmistakable. These 
are the men who fought The War, and if you have to ask which war you are 
clearly not one of them. Their forearms are tattooed with eagles, anchors and 
American flags (the one with 48 stars). 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the Oxnard Elks numbered around 1,200. But 10 years ago, 
membership began to decline while the median age crept upward. Membership 
currently stands at just over 700 and the median age is 69. Therein lies the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Center for Health Statistics calculates that a group of men with 
an average age of 69 has a mortality rate of 3% per year. Not surprisingly, 
many lodges composed of men in their 60s are declining at about 3% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Time, tobacco and red meat has apparently caught up with many of them. Spitzer 
suddenly lost several friends in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just wake up in the morning dead," he lamented. From a Different Era 
</P>
<P>
 "The men who built these organizations were products of World War I and World 
War II, both episodes in our history when there was a lot of bonding among 
men," said USC sociologist Vern Bengston. "Baby boomers haven't had that sort 
of generational, fraternal experience." 
</P>
<P>
 And the ones who have don't seem anxious to reconstruct the camaraderie of 
wartime. Vietnam veterans, for example, have comparatively low membership in 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion, according to the national 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline that's now cutting into the Elks and putting cracks through the 
Masons is an intensification of a trend that felled such groups as the Woodmen 
of the World and caused the Redmen to pale into oblivion. The Knights of 
Pythias, which had 1.8 million members at the turn of the century, now numbers 
only 76,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, just about any town with a population over 5,000 had at least one 
lodge, its atmosphere redolent of tobacco smoke, fried food and fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 All the lodges shared a taste for ritual and bombastic titles that are 
occasionally lampooned even in modern media. Howard Cunningham of television's 
"Happy Days" was offended when anyone ridiculed the "grand pooh-bah," leader of 
the fictitious Leopard Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble periodically recited the cacophonous 
password for their lodge, the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos. 
</P>
<P>
 Bengston said the founders of many fraternal groups were poking fun at the 
elaborate ritual of the venerable Masons when they established ceremonies for 
their own lodges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some picked the most ridiculous thing they could come up with for their 
mascots," Bengston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The moose, for example. How did an animal most people recognize as a shaggy 
deer with a nose drawn badly out of proportion become a symbol of strength and 
independence revered by more than 1.5 million men and women nationwide? 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Mary Anne Clawson, author of "Constructing Brotherhood," said 
enrollment rituals mocked the somber tones so effectively that orders starting 
as spoofs quickly became solemn, a factor contributing to their decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Further erosion has come with service clubs that siphon off middle-class 
members. Clubs like Lions, Rotary and Optimists are different because fraternal 
groups have secret rituals (details of which are often available at public 
libraries). Service organizations typically are also more class-specific. 
</P>
<P>
 "Merchants, professionals and managers who aspire to business leadership in 
the community join service clubs," Clawson said, "whereas fraternal orders 
believe that what you do in the outside world should not be a condition of 
membership." 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Robertson, secretary of the Simi Valley Elks Lodge, states membership 
requirements as follows: "To be an Elk you need to be an American gentleman, 
believe in God and flag waving." 
</P>
<P>
 As he said, you need to be male. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many organizations have women's auxiliaries, the women must have some 
familial connection to male members. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have sought unsuccessfully to end the discrimination by legislation, but 
society seems poised to accomplish the gender blending that government cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decline in fraternals is due in part to the remaking of the American 
family," Bengston said. "With dual incomes becoming more and more common, men 
are sharing parenting tasks and they have less time to carouse with their 
buddies than they did 50 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The mass media are providing increasing competition for the leisure time that 
men might have spent with their buddies. With 50 cable channels, VCR and 
interactive video games, who wants to listen to an aging veteran recount 
stories he's been telling since VJ Day. 
</P>
<P>
 By and large, boomers couldn't care less. 
</P>
<P>
 A.C. Butler, a mason in Oxnard since 1975, laments the fact that his son isn't 
interested in the brotherhood. "Both he and his wife are working and they don't 
have the time," Butler said. "There's just so much more to do these days than 
when we were growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Father and son masonry is a big thing since the Masons, as the oldest 
fraternal organization in America, value tradition. They are eager to recount 
their famous members, among them Presidents, signers of the Declaration of 
Independence and a guy named Snodgrass. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Snodgrass was center fielder for the 1912 World Series New York Giants 
and a Mason in good standing at the Oxnard lodge. Snodgrass and the Giants were 
one out from winning the series when a Red Sox batter hit a routine fly ball to 
center. Snodgrass camped under it for the Series-winning catch. 
</P>
<P>
 He dropped it, of course, and Boston went on to win the game and the Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Snodgrass episode isn't the sort of story that makes an effective 
recruiting tool for the next generation of American Masonry. But Dwight Henry, 
former supervisor of the now defunct youth group at the Oxnard lodge, found 
bigger impediments to maintaining youth interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids didn't seem to have any support from their parents," he said. "I 
don't care whether you're talking about the Boy Scouts or whatever, without 
parental support it doesn't fly. I turned into an inexpensive baby-sitter." 
Fraternal Success Story 
</P>
<P>
 Baby-sitting, in a manner of speaking, is the key to one of the few fraternal 
success stories, Moose International Inc. Fraternal clubs aren't offering day 
care yet, but Moose has repositioned itself to appeal more to families, and as 
a result membership is growing in Ventura County and nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The 426-member lodge in Simi Valley has added several men between 25 to 35 
years old, most with young children. The clubhouse has video games and pinball 
so younger members of the family can entertain themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We built a swimming pool," said manager Jim Wass. "During the summer there's 
30 to 40 kids in there. We've also got family night where we serve a burger, 
fries and a drink for $2. The place is full of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The Moose is a solidly working-class fraternity, according to Louis Ortiz, 
Oxnard Moose member and state sergeant at arms. Members are likely to appear in 
the club room with tape measures clipped to their belts. In their wallets they 
carry snapshots of their powerboats. 
</P>
<P>
 Correspondingly, the headquarters in Moosehart, Ill., launched a sign-up drive 
that awards members with a blue-collar incentive: a set of jumper cables for 
every five prospects recruited. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to modernize their image, members changed the name from the Loyal 
Order of the Moose to the less archaic-sounding Moose International Inc. 
Together with the name change, the Moose eliminated the ceremonial velvet cape 
and the traditional headgear "the tah" -- that's hat spelled backward -- and 
overhauled the enrollment ritual, all to great effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley alone, they have handed out six sets of jumper cables. A Look 
at Some Fraternal Organizations 
</P>
<P>
 ELKS: An Elks information packet lists "Americanism" as the leading community 
affair that the Elks sponsor. In Ventura County, that translates to sponsorship 
for dozens of Little League teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the Elks employ two traveling health workers to visit public 
schools where they administer eye tests and screen children for orthopedic 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, contributions were off 4.7% last year. Officials fear the dip 
might mark the beginning of a long decline. Locally, bingo has emerged as a 
major funding source for charitable works. 
</P>
<P>
 MASONS: Masons are the oldest fraternity in America. Ironically, their secret 
ritual is what most people know them for. Like many fraternal organizations, 
the Masons look askance at service clubs, which they dismiss as being mainly 
business-oriented. Business is one of two topics barred from discussion in the 
lodge, the other is religion. Nevertheless, the National Conference of Catholic 
Bishops has for 200 years barred Catholics from the secret society. Masons are 
often accused of involvement in implausible, multinational conspiracies. Most 
recently, Serbian nationalists in the former Yugoslavia cited the 
"Judeo-Masonic order" as their enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 SHRINERS: Masons of the highest degree, they are best recognized for precision 
mini-bike drill teams and the like. Their antics support 19 orthopedic 
hospitals for children and three burn institutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Their $4-billion trust fund makes them better funded than many universities. 
Despite aging membership, the money keeps coming in, much of it as bequests in 
the wills of deceased members, according to an official at Shriners 
headquarters in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 MOOSE: A solidly blue-collar organization and the only one that can report 
modest membership gains. There are seven lodges in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moose mainly looks after its own. The Moose school and orphanage in 
Moosehart, Ill., is primarily for those with some connection to the Moose, 
although some non-members are included. Only Moose members are eligible to 
attend Moosehaven, a retirement community in Florida where, among other 
amenities, beer costs just a nickel a glass. 
</P>

 Fraternal Moments

JAUNTS; MIGRATION OF WHALES PRESENTS A SIGHT THAT ISN'T EASY TO FORGET; THIS IS 
THE SEASON WHEN THEY PASS THE CHANNEL ISLANDS ON THE WAY TO BAJA CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's whale watching season again, but what really are the chances of 
witnessing that magnificent migration from the Bering Sea to Baja California as 
it passes by the Channel Islands? 
</P>
<P>
 You've got a whale of a chance, say officials with Island Packers, which 
offers whale-watching cruises out of Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing whales every day," said Heather Wagner, an Island Packers 
staffer. On a Jan. 3 trip, passengers saw 18, she said, and one was breeching 
-- a spectacular sight as it heaves most of its massive bulk out of the water 
and plunges back with a huge splash. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Saturday trip wasn't that productive, but still was impressive. For 
about 20 minutes, passengers watched five whales cruising the waters just this 
side of Anacapa Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3 1/2-hour trip was aboard the Vanguard, a 65-foot boat that can hold up 
to 65 people. The boat has a galley where passengers can buy doughnuts and 
beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Vanguard left the dock, crew member Holly Snyder said the waters were 
calm, but warned that some people get sick no matter how calm the seas. For the 
smoothest ride, sit at the rear, she advised; better viewing spots are at the 
front and up on the top deck. 
</P>
<P>
 It took nearly an hour for the boat to get into the deeper waters between the 
coast and the islands, where the whales are most often spotted. The captain, 
Glen Galbraith, first veered toward a group of dolphins a half-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, he guided the boat among a half dozen or so Risso's dolphins, gliding 
through the waters just a few yards from the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not bothered by us at all," Snyder said. "They're putting on a 
beautiful show." The dolphins dove and surfaced, noisily spouting water. 
Sometimes they nuzzled each other underwater. 
</P>
<P>
 The show continued for a half-hour when Galbraith got a radio call from 
another boat about some whales closer to Anacapa. He took off, passing Platform 
Gail, an oil drilling operation, along the way. Near the platform on a buoy, 
seven sea lions huddled, basking in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the boat reached the whales, their white spouts were visible on 
the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll try to get behind them slowly -- we don't want to make them nervous," 
Galbraith said as the boat approached. 
</P>
<P>
 These were Pacific Gray Whales, the kind most likely to be seen by whale 
watchers locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Off Ventura County's coast, the whales are first spotted in December heading 
south. They travel about 5 m.p.h., roughly 115 miles per day, with pregnant 
whales leading the migration. By the end of March, when the season ends, they 
pass this way again, their children in tow, on their way north. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day there were five whales traveling together, their twin blowholes 
spouting a mist as they surfaced for air every three to four minutes. They 
flipped their tail flukes out of the water before diving back under. The wet 
exhalation could be heard on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 These were average size for gray whales which can reach lengths of 40 to 50 
feet. As they traveled below the surface, they left a "footprint" on the water, 
a rippling effect caused by the vertical thrusts of the tail. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthralled by the sight was Shirley Christy of Los Angeles, who has been whale 
watching the last 15 years, casting off with Island Packers 30 to 40 times a 
season. She fondly recalled seeing five mating pairs on one trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "We killed the motors," she said. "It was very exotic." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Whale watching cruises to observe the migrating gray whales. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Island Packers offers 3 1/2-hour excursions Saturday and Sunday (some 
during the week) through the end of March. Departure times vary. Call for exact 
times. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Call 642-1393 for departure times and reservations. Dress warmly;

rolls some. The Vanguard has restrooms. 
</P>

programs on gray whales every Saturday and Sunday through March. The free 
45-minute program is at 3 p.m. in the auditorium.

ENTERTAINMENT; EXHIBITION TO BENEFIT ATHLETICS AT UCSB; HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS 
WILL PAY A VISIT TO CAMPUS WEDNESDAY. POWER FORWARD KELVIN (SPECIAL K) HILDRETH 
TALKS ABOUT THE TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Consider "no future" for a moment. Wile E. Coyote. The extra, nameless crewmen 
who beam down to the uncharted planet with Kirk and Spock. Lorena Bobbitt and 
the ginzu knife franchise for Boys Town. Pork Twinkies. Frisbees for cats. 
William Tell's kid with the hiccups. Whoever has to play the Harlem 
Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Globetrotters haven't lost a game since Richard Nixon was in office. When 
they lost 100-99 on Jan. 5, 1971, it snapped a 2,495-game winning streak. 
Overall, their record is something like 18,350 wins and 331 losses. Expect one 
more win when the Globetrotters perform at a Wednesday night exhibition to 
benefit UC Santa Barbara athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about every basketball innovation from fast breaks to slam dunks to 
no-look passes -- the Globetrotters probably did it first. The team, now in its 
68th season, have a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, three movies and a 
zillion fans. They've played in 112 countries from Algeria to Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelvin (Special K) Hildreth, a 6-foot-8 power forward out of Los Angeles, 
discussed the life and times of the most famous basketball team in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the winning streak up to now? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh man, I'd say around 15,000 or so. 
</P>
<P>
 How often do you guys play? 
</P>
<P>
 We do 200 to about 260 games a year. Sometimes we play seven days in a row, 
eight games a week, sometimes twice a day. When we go overseas, we usually end 
up playing the country's national team. We played the Russians and beat them by 
seven or eight. We played the Australian team and beat them by quite a bit. One 
time, we played the Chinese national team; those guys were all bigger than we 
were. We got the tap, and I was going for a dunk when their center kneed me in 
the hip. I was out three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are the usual victims you guys always beat up on? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Washington Generals. We don't travel with them or hang out with them 
or anything. They don't like us. They just have the same schedule. It's sort of 
a continuing grudge match. Any time you get big guys 6-9, 6-10 or 6-11 going at 
each other, there's a lot of elbows and pushing going on. One time at half 
court, two guys squared off and started going at it. There was blood and guts 
-- the whole thing. So as I'm escorting our guy back to the bench, I heard some 
fan say, "Oh man, how'd they do that? That looked real." They thought it was 
part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the secret to surviving on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest thing is trying to make time to get enough rest. You have to take 
care of your body, eat as well as you can and try to stay on top of injuries. 
There's not a lot of down time in between shows. 
</P>
<P>
 As goodwill ambassadors, you guys are almost too good to be true. Is it hard 
to be nice all the time? 
</P>
<P>
 You know it is. It's a very difficult job, and there's a lot of demands that 
come with it. You know how exhausting kids can be -- they have lots of energy. 
We're constantly giving. But, I'm still excited every time I go out there. We 
feed off the energy the crowd gives us. And every time you look up, there's a 
fresh face that wants everything because we haven't been to their town for a 
long time. Plus, we get to rub elbows with kings, queens and prime ministers, 
so there's that. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you become a member of the Globetrotters? 
</P>
<P>
 After I got out of college at Mississippi State, I went to a tryout with the 
Clippers, but I wasn't really prepared to play for large sums of money. I 
figured if they liked my jump shot, that's all there is to it. But at a pro 
camp, it's a fight -- you're fighting for a job. I made it to the second cut. 
Then I tried out for the Sacramento Kings, and they were all set to sign me 
when they told me to wait a couple of weeks. You know, bills don't wait, so my 
agent suggested I go to the Globetrotters training camp. I did, but I ended up 
playing in a pro league in Italy, where there was a lot of pressure. Anyway, 
the Globetrotters called and offered me a two-month contract and sent me a 
first-class plane ticket. That was 1987, and here I am. 
</P>
<P>
 What's training camp like? 
</P>
<P>
 There's a camp every year around September. Everyone gets a one-year contract, 
so no one gets complacent. You have to come to camp in shape with fire in your 
eyes. Right now, there's two Globetrotters teams with 10 guys on each team. 
Every year, 20 or 25 guys try out and maybe one or two new guys make it. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would win if each Globetrotters team played each other? 
</P>
<P>
 There's no difference between them. They'd win one, then we'd win one -- like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Globetrotters ever lose 331 games anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 It was a long time ago, but it happens, you know. Back then, they played all 
comers. We're getting back to that. In the next couple of years, we'll be 
playing a CBA all-star team, and then -- maybe I shouldn't tell you this -- but 
we'll be playing NBA teams again. 
</P>
<P>
 If you guys were in the NBA, how would you do? 
</P>
<P>
 We'd be somewhere near the top. Last time we played an NBA team, it was the 
Minneapolis Lakers in the late '40s, early '50s and they were the champs. We 
beat them in a best of five series. Since then, the NBA has sort of shied away 
from us because they can't call themselves world champions if we beat them. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you ever regret not playing in the NBA? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, no, because I truly enjoy what I do. We're competitive with those 
guys, anyway. They're our peers. We have a lot of friends in the NBA. I do 
think people tend to take us for granted, though. If some guy makes a 
half-court shot, you'll see it 100 times on ESPN. We make half-court shots 
every night. The NBA has three-point shooters, but we always have too. 
</P>
<P>
 Your team invented fast-break basketball, "Showtime" in general, but also the 
high post offense, the point guard and all sorts of stuff. Why does it take 
everyone else so long to catch on to what the Globetrotters have been doing? 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's the power of the mass media. Like I said, a lot of people tend to 
take us for granted. Everyone loved Magic Johnson. I would rate him even higher 
than Michael Jordan. But it's not like Magic was the first one. We've had guys 
that could shoot better, dribble better and pass better. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you account for the continued success of the organization? 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has a team, but there's only one Harlem Globetrotters. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Harlem Globetrotters.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; PLEASANT TASTES OF FRANCE; OPENED IN 1980 BY TWO SISTERS, 
MOUSSE ODILE SERVES CONSISTENTLY WORTHY DISHES AND DESSERTS WITH A TOUCH OF 
CHARM AND GRACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In Santa Barbara, French restaurants have been closing down one by one, 
abandoned by diners who are opting for Italian and who share the common 
perception, perhaps, that French food is too rich and too fussy for current 
tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mousse Odile, one of the oldest French restaurants in Santa Barbara, may be 
the lone survivor -- unless one counts Citronelle -- and I don't -- Citronelle 
being the epitome of California cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Inquiring into the secret of Mousse Odile's longevity recently afforded me 
some very pleasant investigations au table.  
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1980 by Yvonne Mathieu and her sister, Odile, Mousse Odile 
originally specialized in desserts but soon switched to serving full meals. 
Yvonne Mathieu, who eventually bought out her sister, serves cuisine bourgeoise 
, or French home cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time I ate here almost 10 years ago, I discovered a restaurant where 
I felt both charmed and utterly at home. And the food has remained remarkably 
consistent over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 There are certain dishes one can only get at Mousse Odile, dishes good enough 
to pop into mind at odd moments and inspire a certain craving. Among these I 
count the celeri Victor ($6.25), a dish of cooked celery, served cold with 
hard-boiled eggs, anchovies and capers in a tasty, creamy fermiere sauce. I am 
quite fond of a fine croissant, filled with spinach and sauteed mushrooms. And 
I love the ficelles, ($4.95-$6.25) Parisian sandwiches on 12-inch-long, thin, 
crispy rolls, filled with cold sliced meats like lamb or chicken and a lovely 
mustard remoulade sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 I go to Mousse Odile for social breakfasts, for the atmosphere, to meet 
friends, knowing the coffee will be rich and dark, the fresh bread will be 
crusty and the pots of butter and jams irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 I go for dinner, knowing the food will be choice and satisfying, with entrees 
like classic filet mignon ($16.95) in a green pepper cognac sauce, or an 
amazing rack of lamb ($18.95), cooked to perfection. Always there will be the 
marvelous vegetables that are the hallmark of the best French cooking. Like any 
self-respecting cook, Mathieu is not afraid of stretching the boundaries of her 
menu, and so she might offer a succulent, spicy couscous, a rich tender osso 
bucco ($15.65) or a tasty paella ($15.75) with more seafood than rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch is my favorite meal at Mousse Odile. I can sample the marvelous soups, 
such as a subtle, creamy vegetable with a hint of squash, or a silky hot 
broccoli soup with a touch of lemon. Most meals come with the splendid house 
salad, as simple as a Chanel suit, with only fresh buttery lettuce coated in 
delicious dressing. Mathieu won't give you the recipe for it, but you can take 
home a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, I've been disappointed. The duck in a plain pasta recently was 
too gamy. And a boudin noir -- black sausage -- tasted more like salty bread 
crumbs. But at the same time, we had a wonderful bouchee a la reine -- light 
pastry filled with chicken and mushrooms in a fine veloute sauce, and a 
remarkably good salmon, garnished with fresh cranberries. 
</P>
<P>
 As befitting a restaurant named after a dessert, the ones served here are 
quite fine indeed. I recently had a marvelous poached pear, perched in a light 
creme anglaise.  
</P>
<P>
 Also wonderful was a moist, moist orange cake with a frosting so creamy it was 
practically a pudding. And finally, a Christmas dessert of chocolate and 
hazelnut mousse that now makes me wish for Christmas all over again. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Mousse Odile.

 * WHERE: 18 E. Cota St., Santa Barbara.

STICK TO BUYING GOODS THAT LOOK PLAIN AND OLD-FASHIONED, THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO 
BEING ENVIRONMENTALLY CORRECT.

 This is the time of the year when retailers have "white sales" to move their 
stock of bath and bedroom accessories. The goods involved these days, however, 
go way beyond what used to be understood as "linens." 
</P>
<P>
 As anyone knows by now, white sales are no longer white. The range of 
available colors for sheets and towels is more evocative of June or October 
than January. 
</P>
<P>
 You can still get plain white goods, of course. But I want to evoke the "white 
sale" concept because the closer we stick to buying sheets and towels that look 
plain and old-fashioned, the closer we are to being environmentally correct. 
</P>
<P>
 My own shopping standards are, I confess, old-fashioned. I buy things that I 
can use forever and will not, I hope, go out of style. That means pure, plain 
cotton. These days, happily, the price of such goods is competitive with the 
synthetic stuff that might wear through, fade and always feel funny on the 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a word about plain cotton rather than mixes involving synthetics. 
There's a school of thought that cotton growing ruins topsoil and water 
supplies. That is less true today than it was a decade ago, particularly in the 
U.S.A., where the economics of growing it have forced farmers to cut back on 
expensive chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Synthetic fibers, on the other 
hand, involve use of petroleum or coal, which are not renewable resources. 
</P>
<P>
 My concern here, perhaps selfishly, is about the environment closer to me -- 
my county and my skin. Even many 100% cotton products are made in ways that 
involve chemical processing. That is why they feel funny when you first use 
them out of the wrapper. But washings, sometimes several, remove the chemicals. 
Of course, it puts the chemicals into the local water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 If we take a little care when shopping the white sales, we can avoid goods 
that might be filled with dyes and chlorine bleach that have to be washed out 
in our home washing machines. 
</P>
<P>
 De Ann Fornes, who operates Homespun Fabric & Draperies in Ventura, explained 
that her line of goods has had these chemicals removed before they reach our 
county: "We have the factory wash the fabrics out -- that gets it back to a 
natural state." 
</P>
<P>
 She's not talking about organic cotton grown without the use of chemicals. 
That, she says, results in a product too expensive to compete in the 
marketplace. Her products are called natural as opposed to organic. 
</P>
<P>
 By her definition, you and I end can up with natural cotton by going to 
Target, Strouds or the local department store, buying 100% cotton sheets, or a 
bathrobe or towel, and washing them a couple of times ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that process removes substances that might irritate the skin, it puts 
detritus from the original fabric into the water system. Fornes contends that 
repeated washings with a nontoxic, non-polluting, baking soda-based detergent 
can remove most of the chemicals used in the manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
 With 100% cotton that has been subjected to no dyeing or bleaching, the result 
is a sheet or bedspread that, in my opinion, looks better with each washing. 
The earth tone gets more vivid, which you can see in the before-and-after 
samples on display. 
</P>
<P>
 If this kind of product catches on, there is an obvious environmental benefit. 
Communities where this unprocessed cotton is woven will be spared all 
non-pesticide chemicals that would normally be used to bulk, brighten and size 
the fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular readers of this column know that I consider it good environmental 
practice to buy and keep things forever rather than being a member of the 
"throwaway society." 
</P>
<P>
 At this time of year when "white sale" goods may be on folk's minds, it was 
heartening for me to hear Fornes remark: "We have reorders for products that 
have lasted 25 years . . . for the same item." Maybe folks are returning to the 
old ways of shopping -- not for flash but forever.

 * FYI: Be sure to wash 100% cotton with a nontoxic, non-polluting detergent.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; GRAFFITI BUSTER PUTS 
YOUTHS ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Monday night, Charlotte Bedard laid down the law. In a metal building near a 
remote baseball field, the co-founder of Sylmar Graffiti Busters faced two 
troubled teen-agers and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some rules you have to follow if you're going to work for me," she 
said to two 16-year-olds sentenced to work for Graffiti Busters instead of 
sitting out their time in the clogged Juvenile Hall on the other side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 In the folding chair closest to Bedard sat a youth convicted of armed robbery 
after holding up someone with a .22 at a Van Nuys carnival. Behind him, tending 
her 7-month-old child, sat a Pacoima teen-ager convicted of possession of PCP 
and being under the influence of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Still wearing her business clothes from earlier in the day, Bedard leaned 
against the grill of a worn, mustard yellow truck parked in the warehouse and 
began to lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 8 o'clock in the morning to 4 o'clock in the afternoon, you belong to 
me," said the Sylmar business owner to the two teen-agers who must work 
weekends cleaning graffiti and streets. "That clock up there is God. If you 
come one second after 8 o'clock, don't even bother signing in." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight o'clock is starting time on weekends for the juvenile offenders and 
court-assigned adults sent to Graffiti Busters. It's a rule Bedard has written 
in stone. 
</P>
<P>
 She continued lecturing the youths and their impatient parents with the firm 
voice of an annoyed substitute teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "No baggy pants. If the pants, after I take the belt off, fall down, that's 
baggy to me," she said, moving to absenteeism. "If you're dying in bed, I'll 
excuse it. You have a sentence to serve, and I expect you to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she smiled and added, "I really am a good person." 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old, with a persistent New Hampshire accent despite 27 years in 
Sylmar, helped form Graffiti Busters in 1988 after having spray paint cans 
tossed at her car in a grocery store parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 She and fellow Sylmar resident Hannah Dyke, who recently left California, 
formed Sylmar Graffiti Busters in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt if I took one kid doing wrong and set them on the right track, 
we would have done something," Bedard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She truly cares about the kids' best interest," said Tom Weissbarth, who 
joined the group about four years ago. "Charlotte's a lady with a lot of energy 
and care and concern for community. . . . She knows all the players in 
graffiti, in law enforcement and politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Weissbarth, now president and director of the group, said Bedard also knows 
when to push the youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got guts. She'll go up against the kids," Weissbarth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She donates a lot of her own time to make sure the system works," said Glen 
Younger, the Los Angeles Police Department's senior lead officer for the Sylmar 
area. "She's out there every weekend with the community service workers and she 
drives around the Sylmar area looking for graffiti to make sure it gets painted 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Kenneth Lee Chotiner has seen Bedard in action. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is just a ball of fire. She's unbelievable," he said. "Nobody backs her 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard believes the youths expect her to be tough but that they look forward 
to the praise they get when they work hard. They can learn more by putting on 
gloves and a reflective orange vest than they can by putting on prison garb, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a kid has to come every weekend for three months and clean graffiti, 
streets, it has more of an impact on them and is more than just a penalty for 
them," she said.

LEGISLATION MAKES HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billy Miller normally has no interest in the fine print of state laws or the 
stilted language of school district regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet new state open enrollment legislation and the school policies it will 
generate intrigue Miller, a football and basketball player who is the best 
athlete at Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the fall, students may attend any school in their district, 
provided there are openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a junior, could transfer either to Newbury Park, whose football team 
was 14-0 last fall, or to Thousand Oaks, whose basketball team has won three 
consecutive league titles. But his coaches can rest easy: Miller is staying 
put. 
</P>
<P>
 He's more interested in who might be looking Westlake's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a school is not doing too good, their best players could transfer to 
Westlake," he said. "For future program building, when I hear about someone 
wanting to quit here or there, I wonder where they'll go." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which took effect this month and gives districts until July 1 
to formulate open enrollment policies, reflects the growing desire of parents 
to have broader choice in the schools their children attend. But many coaches 
and administrators believe lawmakers might as well have proclaimed: You Must 
Implement Chaos.  
</P>
<P>
 The effect on athletics could be far-reaching: The temptation for coaches to 
recruit will be greater and athletes can shop around for the most appealing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the competitive balance of interscholastic athletics. There is 
even speculation that district all-star teams eventually will develop. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some powerhouse teams," said Bob Cooper, the Hoover High 
baseball coach of 20 years. "This is going to open up gigantic questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Under current California Interscholastic Federation rules, recruiting is 
prohibited and transfers must change residence or lose a year of varsity 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Can those regulations remain? 
</P>
<P>
 Or does the new legislation change all the rules? THE CIF 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF is expected to announce within weeks whether its current transfer rule 
will stay on the books. Some officials want to hold firm while others believe 
the regulation must be modified in light of open enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the CIF distributed a letter to schools stating that because of 
the new law, athletes would be eligible immediately when they transfer. The 
letter brought an outcry from schools urging the CIF to continue to regulate 
the transfer of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was concern, so we decided to study the residential eligibility issue 
further," CIF Commissioner Thomas Byrnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the current transfer rule be retained, however, it is almost certain to 
be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "A judge somewhere will decide what is right and wrong," said Richard Newman, 
a Conejo Valley Unified School District trustee. "This issue will not be 
decided by school personnel, it will be litigated. That's a given." 
</P>
<P>
 The probable scenario: An athlete will transfer under the open enrollment law 
yet be denied a year of athletic eligibility because he or she did not change 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
 The athlete will point out that members of a school band or the drama club are 
able to continue their extracurricular activity upon transferring. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should an athlete be penalized? 
</P>
<P>
 State athletic associations in Colorado and Minnesota have loosened their 
transfer rules in the past two years to accommodate open enrollment. In both 
states, students are eligible for athletics providing they transfer between 
school years and begin attending their new school on the first day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a slight increase in the transfers of athletes, but not as 
much as you would think," said Bert Borgmann, Colorado's assistant commissioner 
of athletics. "There have been a few celebrated cases." 
</P>
<P>
 As local districts struggle to formulate open enrollment policies, they are 
counting on the CIF to provide direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this can't be sorted out until we find out what (the CIF) plans to 
do," said Jerry Dannenberg, a Ventura Unified School District official studying 
the impact of the new laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, athletes should beware. Unless the residence requirement is 
stricken, a year of eligibility will be the price of transferring without 
moving. New law or no new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already got a call, a good football player is interested in attending Rio 
Mesa," said George Contreras, football assistant at Rio Mesa. "Three or four 
other football players in the district, the rumor is they want to come here. 
</P>
<P>
 "If kids are calling us, we want to know what to tell them. I'd hate to see a 
kid transfer, then have to tell him he isn't eligible." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is clear for incoming ninth graders. They will be eligible at 
the school they initially attend regardless of residence, according to Southern 
Section Commissioner Dean Crowley. SOUTHERN SECTION DISTRICTS 
</P>
<P>
 For suburban districts with several high schools -- Oxnard Union and Antelope 
Valley Union each has five, the most in the area -- drafting open enrollment 
policies is a complex task. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the law, students will be accepted into a school outside their 
residency only if there are openings. Should more students apply for enrollment 
than a school can accept, selection must be made without regard to athletic 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadlines for students to transfer must be set to streamline registration. 
Random selection methods for transfers must be devised. And community reaction 
must be gauged. 
</P>
<P>
 Town hall meetings are being held this month throughout the William S. Hart 
Union School District in Santa Clarita before trustees adopt open enrollment 
policies. Hart Union has three high schools and this fall will open a fourth -- 
Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will help the community understand requirements of the law and discuss 
problems the district faces as it implements regulations," said Lew White, the 
Hart Union administrator addressing open enrollment. "I am sure that athletics 
will be a hot topic." 
</P>
<P>
 Most districts plan to adopt policies well before the July deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Union must have regulations in place quickly because registration for 
the 1994-95 school year begins in February. Conejo Valley Unified 
administrators have completed a draft on a transfer policy and will soon submit 
it to trustees. Antelope Valley Union, Ventura Unified, Glendale Unified, 
Burbank Unified and Las Virgenes Unified will seek board approval by April. 
</P>
<P>
 For guidance, districts can look to the California School Board Assn., once it 
establishes its open enrollment policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will use the (CSBA policy) as a starting point and turn it into what is 
workable for us," said Bill Studt, superintendent of the Oxnard Union High 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from several districts say athletes -- or any other students -- will 
be unable to transfer anywhere, anytime they please. 
</P>
<P>
 An enrollment cap will be established at each school, restricting transfers. 
From an athletics standpoint, such limits might give one school an advantage 
over another in the same district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura High could handle more students, while Buena is a bit overcrowded," 
Dannenberg said. "We'd much rather see kids go to Ventura. W look very 
carefully at transfers coming into Buena." 
</P>
<P>
 Deadlines for application will force students to plan a transfer well in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not allow transfers mid-year," said Robert Girolamo, superintendent 
of the Antelope Valley Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley district already allows students to transfer without 
changing residence. CITY SECTION 
</P>
<P>
 In the L.A. Unified School District's 49 high schools, open enrollment means 
business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive district has long offered greater school choice, larger loopholes 
and more bureaucracy, an equation that results in an enormous amount of 
cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the City people are already used to it. A kid can almost go anywhere 
now. What changes?," said Jim Woodard, the longtime Taft High basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes have used -- or misused -- voluntary desegregation and magnet 
programs to transfer without changing residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all they must do is simply apply to the school of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a former high school principal, I see real problems," said Francis 
Nakano, an LAUSD assistant superintendent who is studying open enrollment. "I 
hope it doesn't get out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools with better reputations, academic and athletic, probably will benefit. 
But coaches who recruit stand to gain the most of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told I'll probably be getting a lot of guys because Taft is a 
desirable school," Woodard said. "On the other hand, these coaches who deal in 
youth leagues will be after those kids early. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they won't have to say, 'We'll provide an address for you.' This law has 
eliminated that step." UNDUE INFLUENCE 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting still will be prohibited by the CIF, according to Commissioner 
Byrnes. But the rules might need to be more vigorously enforced, and the CIF 
does not have the personnel or budget to crack down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coach who wants to commit mischief is the coach who weakens the entire 
system," said Newman, the Conejo trustee. "Other coaches will react. Mischief 
will determine what is ethical." 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting can be difficult to prove. Typically, athletes in a successful 
program, or their parents, do the selling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids want to go where there is a winner," said Contreras, the Rio Mesa 
assistant. "If it's that important to a family, they'll find a way." 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands football Coach Joel Gershon believes coaches contacted by 
athletes from other schools should encourage them not to transfer. He raised 
the point at a recent meeting of the Ventura County Football Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought this up and there was stone silence," he said. "That worries me. 
Everybody is taking an attitude of 'How is this going to affect me?' rather 
than, 'Who are we as coaches? What do we stand for?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard, the Taft basketball coach, does not believe any kind of ethical 
standard can be established in the City Section. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are teaching kids to lie about addresses and about who they 
talked to," he said. "Everyone is appalled when later they get in a college 
scandal, but it's no surprise. They've been taught to lie since junior 
high."(MORE)

REARDON TO STEP DOWN, SOURCES SAY; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: COACH AT RIO MESA FOR 
26 YEARS, HE ADMITS ONLY THAT HE WILL MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Coach John Reardon, who led the Rio Mesa High football team during parts of 
four decades, will announce his retirement Friday, sources said Wednesday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Two school sources confirmed that the popular Reardon, Ventura County's 
all-time leader in football victories, will relinquish his coaching duties 
during a news conference scheduled at 1 p.m. Friday at Rio Mesa.Reardon, 59, is 
expected to remain in his position as chairman of the Spartans' physical 
education department. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Reardon nor Rio Mesa Athletic Director Brian FitzGerald would comment 
on the coach's status. Both, however, did confirm Reardon will make an 
announcement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, Reardon intimated he might retire from coaching. The 
Spartans finished 6-4, 3-4 in Channel League play. Rio Mesa failed to qualify 
for the Southern Section Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon took control of the Spartans' varsity in 1967. In 26 seasons, Reardon 
had a record of 154-119-4. 
</P>
<P>
 He guided Rio Mesa to a section championship in 1971 with a 28-20 victory over 
Paso Robles. The Spartans lost to Atascadero, 20-14, in a 1983 section title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his career, Reardon has been among the county's most-respected 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know for sure if he's retiring, but I'm sure going to miss him 
if he is," Ventura Coach Phil McCune said. "He's been such a respected coach 
for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't replace people like John Reardon." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Coach Rick Scott has often suggested naming the annual county all-star 
high school football game after Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a guy who has been in coaching for all the right reasons," Scott said. 
"He does things the way they should be done."

CHANGEOVER; TURNING FROM TENNIS -- AND NOTRE DAME -- MARCACCINI NO. 3 STARTS 
ANEW AT CRESPI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gianandrea Marcaccini poured in 22 points last week to help the Crespi High 
basketball team bury Notre Dame -- the team his older brothers put on the map. 
Ironic? Yes, but consider how easily things might have been different. 
</P>
<P>
 What if Gianandrea's promising tennis career hadn't been ended by a rare and 
painful disorder in his elbow? Or what if the fastest way to get from Encino to 
Notre Dame didn't involve a freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 Or, and this is the big one, what if Notre Dame Coach Pete Cassidy hadn't cut 
Gianandrea from his basketball team in November? 
</P>
<P>
 Cut a Marcaccini? At Notre Dame? 
</P>
<P>
 Last season Monte Marcaccini carried the Knights to the Southern Section 
Division III-A championship. G.C. starred there a couple of years earlier. Both 
are now playing basketball in Italy, G.C. professionally and Monte for a junior 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 When they returned home for Christmas, they were shocked to find a practice 
jersey of archrival Crespi in their little brother's bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last spring, Gianandrea was two counties away, helping the Santa Barbara 
High tennis team to its fifth consecutive Southern Section Division I 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 A highly ranked junior player, Gianandrea played tennis at Notre Dame as a 
freshman, but he spent his sophomore year living with his grandparents in Santa 
Barbara because his father Giancarlo, an international businessman, was 
spending the year in Italy and his mother Alicia planned to spend a couple of 
months there too. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Marcaccini said it would have been too difficult to transport 
Gianandrea to Notre Dame while she and her husband were out of the country, and 
Monte couldn't drive him because, as a basketball player, he had a different 
schedule than Gianandrea, a tennis player. 
</P>
<P>
 She also asserts it is "purely coincidental" that her parents live in the 
school district that features Southern California's top boys' high school 
tennis program. Sending him to Santa Barbara was a last resort, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kid wants to leave his friends and live with his grandparents?" Alicia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gianandrea's tennis career ended because of an elbow problem that required 
surgery in December, 1992. The surgery was unsuccessful and the pain became 
unbearable as the high school season progressed last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Gianandrea moved back home to Encino over the summer and re-enrolled at Notre 
Dame in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-foot-3 junior, Marcaccini had played basketball with his brothers for 
years but never took it seriously until he had to give up tennis.  
</P>
<P>
 He tried out for the team at Notre Dame, but Cassidy cut him, saying later it 
was because of problems of attitude, not talent. "A difference in philosophy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess Coach thought (Marcaccini) was more of a detriment to the team," 
Notre Dame co-captain Rich Igou said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said if Marcaccini had approached him or one of the captains about the 
problems, he might have reinstated him, but Marcaccini instead transferred to 
Crespi within a week of being cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly, Marcaccini transferred because his mother didn't want him driving 
on the freeway from Encino to school in neighboring Sherman Oaks while she was 
out of the country. Crespi is just blocks from the Marcaccini's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section, presented with 14 pages of documentation, granted 
Marcaccini a hardship waiver in early December, giving him immediate 
eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 The waiver was based on his move from Santa Barbara. Because he never actually 
played a game at Notre Dame, no waiver was needed for the transfer from Notre 
Dame to Crespi, Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini and his mother acknowledge that one of the factors in the transfer 
was Marcaccini's basketball experience at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did have some problems with the coach at Notre Dame," Marcaccini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini's mother does not understand why Gianandrea was cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "What . . . was the hidden agenda?" she said. "If this was an objective 
decision by the coaching staff, then fine, but it seems pretty strange that the 
previous coaching staff used to badger (Gianandrea) to get him in the gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia also said when Gianandrea was cut "it did a huge favor for me," because 
she could persuade Gianandrea to transfer to Crespi, where he wouldn't have to 
drive as far anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini has been practicing with the Celts since late November and playing 
in games since his waiver was granted in early December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could tell right away he was a scorer," Crespi Coach Paul Muff said, "but 
he really lacked a lot of the other fundamentals in basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini learned most of his basketball on playgrounds with his brothers, in 
dunking contests. Needless to say, they spent little time on fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first few times we did passing drills, he didn't even know how to hold 
the ball," Muff said. "But once we showed him, he picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini, who plays small forward, spent most of December near the end of 
the Celt bench, trying to pick up things such as how a real basketball team 
runs an offense and how to make a bounce pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating," Marcaccini said, "but if I went in I didn't really know 
what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Dec. 30, after the Celts had lost five consecutive games, scoring fewer 
than 53 points in the last four, Muff decided he would put Marcaccini in the 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt, geez, he's doing as good a job as anyone else and we knew he could 
score, and that's what we weren't really doing well," Muff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini scored 20. The Celts beat Channel Islands, 59-51. He started the 
next game against St. Bernard. He scored 21 and led Crespi to a 77-65 upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini scored 16 of his 22 points in the second half and the Celts won, 
72-62. Igou said he didn't hear any trash talking from Marcaccini during the 
game. Perhaps Marcaccini was too busy being a "detriment" to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a lot of talent," Cassidy said this week. "He would have helped us a 
lot. I wish it could have worked out, but apparently he is happier at Crespi." 
</P>
<P>
 So far Muff has seen none of the attitude problems that prompted Cassidy to 
cut Marcaccini. He pointed out how well Marcaccini accepted his role on the 
bench during his early weeks at Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 "What transpired at Notre Dame doesn't really involve us," Muff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, no one else is scoring for the Celts (7-8, 3-2 in Mission League 
play), who defeated Alemany, 50-41, Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really has a nose for offensive basketball," Muff said. "He really has a 
nice shot and some skills for the game. He's probably our best offensive 
rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has really surprised me is the way he's come along in such a short time. 
It's nice that he's a junior. We can have him back next year too."

DIGEST: POPE ACCEPTS INDIANA'S TENNIS OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Nordhoff High tennis player Derek Pope has signed a letter of intent to 
Indiana. Now a senior at Lake Mary (Fla.)High who has spent the past year 
attending the Amre Sammakia Tennis Academy there, Pope said he wanted to sign 
early and enjoy his senior year of high school competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a piano was taken off my back," Pope said. "Now I can just go out 
and play and not have to stress over my ranking." 
</P>
<P>
 Pope was contacted by more than 80 schools before narrowing his choices to 
Florida, SMU, Arizona and Clemson along with the Hoosiers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Indiana had the best all-around environment," Pope said. "I like the town and 
the campus is beautiful. I like the coach and the players. And the facilities 
-- it has 16 indoor courts. They pamper their athletes and I'm honored to have 
the opportunity to go there." 
</P>
<P>
 Pope's father, Karl, played basketball at USC and his mother, Paula Jean, was 
a three-time Olympic diver who also attended USC. But Pope said he never 
considered following his parents' footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope, 17, and Notre Dame-bound doubles partner Jakob Pietrowski won the U.S. 
Tennis Assn. national clay court championship last summer and are currently 
ranked No. 1 in the nation in 18-and-under doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope also was an outstanding basketball player at Nordhoff before withdrawing 
and heading to Florida last year with three games remaining in the season. He 
averaged 21 points and 15 rebounds. DANA HADDAD

OPEN ENROLLMENT, CLOSE DOORS?; LEGISLATION: NEW LAW COULD CREATE DISTRICT SUPER 
TEAMS, DENYING SOME STUDENTS A CHANCE TO PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Open enrollment might forever alter the face of high school athletics, leading 
to the formation of high-powered "district teams" that compete in super leagues 
based on district enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Far-fetched? 
</P>
<P>
 Not to Bob Cooper, the Hoover High baseball coach of 20 years. After examining 
new legislation that permits students to attend any school within a district, 
he offers a hypothetical example in the Glendale Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale High, with its first-rate stadium, would field the district football 
team. Crescenta Valley would field the basketball team and Hoover the baseball 
team. Players wishing to participate at the highly competitive district level 
would attend the school fielding the particular team. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools also would field less competitive "club teams," creating a two-tiered 
system of high school athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that (open enrollment) is going to put some schools out of 
certain sports," Cooper said. "It might start with small sports. If you want to 
play, you go to this school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's sad, because a tremendous number of kids will not be able to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of district teams, startling at first, has some appealing aspects. 
Undue influence and transfer rules become immaterial. Money is saved. A superb 
level of competition is born. 
</P>
<P>
 It might start this way: A district decides that any student wanting to swim 
or play water polo attend the only district school with a pool. A district golf 
team is next. Then a wrestling team. 
</P>
<P>
 In major sports, the trend would begin with the best players gravitating to a 
particular school because of its superior program. Soon, a district team would 
be in place, like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado has had open enrollment for two years. Already, there is a move 
toward district teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them athletic magnet schools, and that may very well be the direction 
high school activities are going," said Bert Borgmann, assistant commissioner 
of athletics in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado took the first step this year by implementing a rule that allows 
schools to combine teams with neighboring schools if those schools are unable 
to field a team. Gymnastics and other minor sports already have fielded what 
Borgmann terms "cooperative teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, check out the Crenshaw boys' basketball team. Nine transfer 
students have made the Cougars one of the best teams in the nation. Their games 
are more of a con than a contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you become a dynasty, other schools get discouraged," said Francis 
Nakano, an assistant superintendent in the L.A. Unified School District. 
"People tend to hate you when you win all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a district team plan, Crenshaw might get some competition instead of the 
steady barrage of scorn it receives now. The City Section, with 49 high 
schools, could be broken into perhaps 10 sub-districts for the purposes of 
forming district teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crenshaw is the standard, the granddaddy of all recruiters, the team all 
recruiters strive to equal," Taft basketball Coach Jim Woodard said with more 
than a trace of sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 District teams would eliminate the need to recruit. Any player who wants to 
play with the best simply tries out. 
</P>
<P>
 The most heated competition might be among coaches: Who gets the district 
team?

PARAMOUNT BOARD STILL BACKS QVC; MERGERS: DIRECTORS SAY VIACOM'S REVISED OFFER 
WON'T CHANGE RECOMMENDATION TO SHAREHOLDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paramount Communications Inc.'s board Wednesday unanimously reaffirmed its 
recommendation that shareholders accept a QVC Network Inc. bid for the 
entertainment giant over a revised offer from Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the higher cash amount contained in Viacom's offer, the board said the 
aggregate value of the QVC bid represents the "best value" for shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the directors did not rebuke Viacom for its 11th-hour 
revision of its bid, as QVC attorneys had proposed in an acerbic, four-page 
letter to the board. Some analysts expect Viacom, which last week entered into 
a merger agreement with Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., to raise its offer 
again before shareholders choose between the rival bids. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis said the auction 
rules established by the company were designed to prevent any more bids from 
being submitted after Feb. 1, and "that deadline will not be extended." 
</P>
<P>
 Trading on Wall Street ended before Paramount disclosed its board's action. On 
the New York Stock Exchange, Paramount closed at $77.25, down 13 cents. QVC 
rose $1.13 in Nasdaq trading to close at $41 per share. Viacom Class A closed 
at $41.50, down 88 cents, while Viacom Class B was unchanged at $38.88. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Friday -- when Viacom increased the cash portion of its bid by $1.1 
billion but reduced the securities it is offering by $900 million -- the Viacom 
bid has trailed that of QVC's by at least $500 million in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stock speculators said Wednesday that they expect Viacom to change its 
offer before Jan. 21 -- when its current bid expires -- in order to extend its 
offer 10 business days (as required by securities law) and make a final bid 
Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Paramount's endorsement really means anything," said one 
trader, speaking not for attribution. "I really think it was a non-event." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "I don't think Viacom wanted an endorsement of their present 
proposal, because QVC could haul both Paramount and Viacom into court and 
complain that the bidding procedure was rigged." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount set aside its friendly merger agreement with Viacom after two court 
rulings in Delaware chastised its board for awarding Viacom certain "lockup" 
provisions and refusing to consider QVC's unsolicited bid. After the Delaware 
Supreme Court ruled, the Paramount board declared an auction of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the auction began, both QVC and Viacom have reduced their cash tender 
offers to 50.1% of Paramount's shares, instead of the 51% proposed in earlier 
tender offers. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC took that action Dec. 23, when it published a supplement to its tender 
offer, but the development was widely overlooked because QVC had issued a news 
release Dec. 20 saying it proposed "to increase the cash component of its 
tender offer for approximately 51% of the outstanding Paramount shares from $90 
per share to $92 per share in cash." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the change, a QVC executive said the company made its initial 
tender offer for Paramount's outstanding shares; the current offer includes 
options as well. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he said, QVC is actually offering to pay cash for a greater 
number of shares, despite the reduced percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't do a press release on it; I think it should have been explained," 
the executive said, asking that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 7, Viacom followed suit, reducing its cash offer to 50.1% from 51%.

INNOVATION: THIS ROAD WILL BE TOUGH ONE TO PAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So where's Ross Perot when you need him? 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, Perot was one of the few Information Age billionaires not in Los Angeles 
for Vice President Al Gore's gala premiere of the Administration's information 
superhighway plans. Too bad. Gore could have used a bit of the edge he 
displayed in battling Perot over NAFTA as he outlined the nation's 
telecommunications future. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are far bigger than a mere trade deal: While U.S. trade with Mexico 
runs close to $81 billion a year, its domestic telecommunications market alone 
is more than twice as large at $172.5 billion -- and that doesn't even include 
the $14-billion-a-year cable TV market, the $13-billion home video market or 
the $25-billion software market. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the United States' domestic media economy is larger than Mexico's 
entire $372-billion annual gross domestic product. By any meaningful measure, 
this Administration's information infrastructure initiatives could have -- for 
better or worse -- a far greater impact on the U.S. economy and employment than 
even the craziest of NAFTA scenarios. So much for giant sucking sounds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As articulated by Gore, the Administration's telecommunications reforms offer 
a genuine departure from the more rigid regulatory regimes of the recent past. 
There is a clear push for more competition, greater network access, more 
federal flexibility and more coherent technical standards to enable seemingly 
disparate networks to readily interconnect. For example, the proposed Title VII 
provisions to let telecommunications companies choose the option to free 
themselves from certain regulatory burdens in exchange for providing 
non-discriminatory access to their networks certainly qualifies as an 
innovative administrative gambit. These are admirable ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Administration's ambitious vision of America's 
telecommunications future is tainted by a disturbingly revisionist 
interpretation of its past. It's an interpretation that cheats the real history 
of the telecommunications marketplace in ways that can distort future policies. 
During his speech, the vice president relentlessly hammered on the theme of 
"universal access" to telecommunications services as the cornerstone of 
Administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all," he said, "governmental action to assure universal service has 
been part of American history since the days of Ben Franklin's post office." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, the vice president told only half the story. "Universal service" in 
telecommunications has always been part of a sweetheart deal cut with private 
industry. The deal was: In exchange for providing universal access, telephone 
companies like AT&T and Pac Bell were assured a cozy rate of return on their 
investment. The same held true for cable television: In exchange for providing 
"low-cost" television access for the community, cable operators were granted a 
monopoly franchise with guaranteed, regulated returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, universal access was explicitly subsidized by guaranteed 
profits. (And we all know what happened in the mid-1980s when the cable 
monopolies were mindlessly freed by Congress from the burden of rate 
regulation: Cable charges skyrocketed. That's literally the price of monopoly 
without regulation.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Administration asserts that it wants to encourage increased 
telecommunications investment and competition even as it insists it wants to 
preserve and extend universal service into the new Media Age. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that universal service was the party line; now it's dial tone," 
says a White House source. "No one really knows what the successor of the dial 
tone will be." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Ross Perot wouldn't say, "It's just not that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 What should universal service mean in the context of competition? Who pays for 
it? In a truly competitive environment, of course, the profits that subsidize 
universal service aren't guaranteed. Just ask the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it will be fascinating to see if the results of the Administration's 
efforts to deregulate local telephone and cable services will more closely 
resemble the perpetual tumult, confusion, bankruptcies -- and cheap rates -- of 
airline deregulation; the venal financial abuses of S&L deregulation, or the 
relatively predictable paths of AT&T, MCI and the long-distance market. No one 
can know. 
</P>
<P>
 Real competition inevitably leads to widening disparities in the breadth and 
quality of service in any marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "What constitutes the floor for universal service is going to rise over time," 
insists the White House staffer, but he acknowledges that "the way that service 
is delivered, however, may turn out to be different in other parts of the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most disgraceful -- but revealing -- moment in Gore's talk was 
when he praised TCI/Bell Atlantic's announcement that they would eventually -- 
for free -- wire classrooms in their service areas as an example of universal 
service. "That's leadership," Gore declared. 
</P>
<P>
 That's leadership? 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom has the mantle of leadership been so misplaced. More accurately, Gore 
was publicly praising a shameless act of pandering. The cost of wiring 
classrooms is marginal, and you can be sure that accessing the networks will 
eventually come at a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody remember the scandalous rent-a-citizen practices the cable 
companies pulled in the 1970s and 1980s to get their monopoly franchises in key 
communities? Well, in the 1990s, it's going to be "Fiber-a-School," 
"Wire-a-Clinic," "Cable-a-Hosptial." 
</P>
<P>
 A real act of leadership would be TCI's John Malone and Bell Atlantic's Ray 
Smith publicly endorsing Gore's call for non-discriminatory access to their 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem with the Administration's telecommunications vision isn't 
that it's vague, it's that the Administration doesn't have the courage to 
acknowledge that genuine deregulation produces confusion and conflicts that 
often can't be anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to credibility and success is being flexible enough to learn from the 
mistakes you will inevitably make. The true test of this telecommunications 
reform effort will be how fast this Administration learns.

TIMES MIRROR, PACTEL PLAN VENTURE; COMMUNICATIONS: THE SERVICE WILL OFFER HOME 
SHOPPING AND TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT AND OTHER INFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a deal that anticipates the multimedia future, Times Mirror Co. and Pacific 
Telesis Corp. said Wednesday that they have formed a joint venture to provide 
electronic home shopping and other consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
 The new service, which is expected to be launched in November in Southern 
California, will allow consumers to shop for items over the phone or personal 
computer. In addition, it will tell them about local restaurants and 
entertainment events and help with travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Media companies, which produce vast amounts of information and other editorial 
content, are looking for ways to participate in the coming information 
superhighway, which is expected to facilitate everything from movies on demand 
to home shopping and long-distance learning. 
</P>
<P>
 The past year has seen a flurry of partnerships between longtime rivals, such 
as newspapers and phone companies, as they look to pool resources and assets in 
an effort to create interactive services whose use they hope will one day be as 
routine as driving a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Cox Enterprises Inc., owner of the Atlanta Journal and 
Constitution, and BellSouth Corp. announced a joint venture to develop and 
market electronic information services of newspaper classified and yellow pages 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of Times Mirror, owner of the Los Angeles Times, and Pacific 
Telesis said the joint venture will essentially create a computer-aided 
electronic version of a business phone directory that will enable customers to 
search for products or services nearest their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Users will be able to conduct searches through a number of cross-referenced 
categories such as make and model, price and location. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard T. Schlosberg III, publisher and chief executive of The Times and 
executive vice president of Times Mirror, said the joint venture will 
"accelerate (the company's) expansion into new technologies," in addition to 
providing new sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times will contribute marketing and promotion backing to the venture as 
well as a link to Times advertisers and subscribers. Pacific Telesis will 
provide technical support. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, customers will be able to call a "shopping assistant" who can match 
a product or service the caller is looking for with a store or business in 
their area. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, the venture will also allow users to search for that information via 
a home computer and see a picture of it on their screen. Once high-capacity 
telecommunications lines are in place, users will be able to watch a "full 
motion video" of the advertised product over a television set -- for example, a 
videotaped tour of a house for sale or a video of a used car advertised in the 
classifieds. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial service to be offered "only describes what is visible on the 
horizon now," said Lee Camp, president of Pacific Telesis Electronic Publishing 
Services and vice president of Pacific Bell. "More important is intent. This 
will evolve under its own steam in response to the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The venture will initially target the Southern California market, but plans 
call for seeking partnerships with other newspapers to provide services around 
the state.

 Although many experts are bullish on the prospects for commercial ventures on 
the information superhighway, it is unclear exactly what services or 
applications will prevail. Media companies, especially newspapers, are expected 
to introduce a variety of services in the coming years to build upon their core 
business of providing information.

 Pacific Telesis is the parent company of regional telephone company Pacific 
Bell. Times Mirror also owns Newsday in New York, among other newspapers, and 
Times Mirror Cable TV, which serves more than a million subscribers.

PREVENTIVE MEDICINE; STANDARDS ON CUMULATIVE TRAUMA WOULD COVER EVERY EMPLOYEE 
IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ground-breaking safety proposal -- a plan intended to protect all employees 
in California from the rapidly spreading ailments known as cumulative trauma 
disorders -- comes under its first public scrutiny today. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed standard, the subject of a hearing in Los Angeles, marks the 
first comprehensive effort by any state to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, 
bursitis and other physical problems linked to repetitive on-the-job 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafted by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the 
standard would apply to all employers and every type of employee, from 
secretaries to meatpackers. State law requires adoption of the standard by the 
end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Cumulative trauma disorders, also called CTDs or repetitive stress injuries, 
have increased explosively to become the leading occupational illness in 
America. The most recent federal statistics report 281,800 cases of such 
disorders in private industry in 1992, up more than twelvefold from a decade 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the progress of the California proposal -- with its potential to 
shape the anticipated national debate on work site ergonomics -- is being 
watched by businesses and unions across the country. The Clinton Administration 
plans to issue its own preliminary ergonomics proposal around September. 
</P>
<P>
 The state standard would require California employers to take several 
measures. First, they would need to provide training alerting every worker to 
the early symptoms of CTDs. In addition, employers would need to review their 
medical, safety and workers' compensation records to determine if their 
employees suffer CTD problems. They would also have to set up procedures for 
reporting such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms would pay for eye examinations and eyeglasses for workers who use 
computer terminals and who are found to need new glasses specifically for their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 For employers that have experienced CTD problems or are found to have CTD 
"risk factors," the standard calls for further measures, including stepped-up 
training, work site evaluations and medical evaluations for the workers 
reporting symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is designed to be as preventive as possible," said John Howard, director 
of Cal/OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor officials, while generally pleased with California's preliminary 
ergonomics proposal, want its requirements tightened. Although there are major 
differences of opinion among business executives, a broad array of employers 
consider parts of the 26-page proposal too expensive, too inflexible and 
lacking in scientific justification. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the proposal is more complicated than a simple attempt to strike a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though advocates regard it as an important initiative to spare workers 
the agony of painful ailments, the proposal is largely intended to solve a 
California business problem: high workers' compensation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another interesting twist is the politics of the standard: It could be an 
awkward election-year issue for Gov. Pete Wilson, who is loath to offend 
business but whose Administration is under the gun to write a final plan before 
next January. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Cal/OSHA say they have been extremely sensitive to the concerns 
of business as well as labor in drafting the proposal. They say the standard 
would save employers money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying premise is that it's cheaper to prevent these CTD injuries 
than to allow them to occur," director Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor leaders, for their part, cite afflicted workers such as Carmen Tapia of 
Boyle Heights. Tapia says she began suffering incapacitating pain and sometimes 
numbness in her right hand and wrist after working more than 20 years at a 
defense plant binding thick harness cables for Navy submarines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't hold on to things anymore," she said. "If I got a cup from the 
cupboard, it would slip out of my hand." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was later diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome, an ailment that 
Tapia, 60, could suffer from for the rest of her life despite undergoing 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, "people don't pay attention to the problem at first. People 
learn to put up with the pain over time, but that's when they get something 
that's permanent and irreversible," said Len Welsh, a Cal/OSHA lawyer and the 
principal drafter of the proposed ergonomics standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross of California, one of the few business concerns to warmly embrace 
the proposed standard, claims it has saved roughly $1 million a year in 
workers' compensation expenses by adopting an ergonomics program for its own 
work force in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Ignatius, health and safety manager for Blue Cross, said the number of 
cases initially shot up after her company's program was launched because 
employees were encouraged to report symptoms immediately. But, she said, 
because Blue Cross now steps in to remedy such problems when they are in their 
early stages, its medical costs have fallen dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see people going into surgery anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While skeptics note that Blue Cross could benefit financially if the companies 
it insures are forced to step up their ergonomics programs, Ignatius said the 
basis of her support for the state's proposal is simply that it would 
effectively reduce CTD problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But major business interests, with direction from the California Chamber of 
Commerce, are pushing Cal/OSHA to rewrite much of the proposal before the 
year-end deadline. Chamber officials say the training and other requirements 
required of all employers, along with the eye exams for many computer users, 
could cost "hundreds of millions." 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber is also seeking an exemption for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Julianne Broyles, director of employment relations issues for the chamber, 
contended that the training requirement familiarizing workers with CTDs might 
spur bogus workers' compensation claims. She speculated that more employees 
would start portraying injuries suffered on weekends as job-related so they can 
collect workers' compensation benefits. "Are we opening up a can of worms?" she 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also want evidence that a CTD symptom "is reasonably likely to be 
work-related" before being required to provide medical attention. In addition, 
they challenge guidelines in the standard specifying such details as the type 
of back support computer operators' chairs should have. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists still know too little about CTDs "to know that if we do certain 
things they will have positive results," said Renee C. Allison, lobbyist for 
the California Newspaper Publishers Assn., one of the members of the chamber 
coalition and an organization representing about 400 newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA officials and their supporters, however, say that the standard would 
still give employers the flexibility to devise their own computer workstations, 
provided they are effective in preventing CTDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's hearing on the standard will begin at 10 a.m. in the auditorium of the 
state office building at 107 S. Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles. The Rapid 
Rise of CTDs 
</P>
<P>
 Cumulative trauma disorders, also known as CTDs or repetitive stress injuries, 
have increased explosively over the past decade to become the nation's No. 1 
occupational illness. CTDs include carpal tunnel syndrome, burstitis, hearing 
loss and other ailments resulting from repeated motions, pressures or 
vibrations experienced on the job.

FIRM HELD LIABLE FOR PERMANENT LAND DAMAGE; ENVIRONMENT: $1.2 MILLION AWARDED 
FOR 'POST-CLEANUP STIGMA' EVEN THOUGH COMPANY WAS REMOVING TOXIC SOIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles jury has ordered an electronics company to pay $1.2 million in 
damages to a landowner for contaminating the dirt under its facility, saying 
the toxic problems have given the property a "stigma" that has permanently 
reduced its value. 
</P>
<P>
 The award was made to Seal Beach-based Bixby Ranch Co. against Spectrol 
Electronics and three co-defendants, including United Technologies, a 
conglomerate in Hartford, Conn. United Technologies owned Spectrol at the time 
of the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is believed to mark the first time in the United States that a 
landowner has won damages from a tenant for permanently impairing the 
property's value. A United Technologies spokesman would not comment because the 
decision is being appealed. Most previous pollution cases have resulted in 
property owners merely being reimbursed for cleanup costs and lost rental 
income.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think this (decision) could mean that a lot more developers are going to be 
suing their tenants for damages," said Jack Rodman, managing partner in the Los 
Angeles office of real estate consultants Kenneth Leventhal & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nothing else, you're going to see a lot more tenants use a lot more 
caution if there are chemicals on the premises," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the verdict would discourage investments in a variety of companies using 
chemicals and solvents -- from print shops to dry cleaners -- and could 
bankrupt firms willing to admit their mistakes and clean up their mess, 
according to a trade group representing small business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one more blow to business owners everywhere," said J. Drew Hiatt, a 
lobbyist and executive vice president of the National Business Owners Assn. in 
Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 The verdict was handed down by a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury last 
month. The plaintiffs announced the verdict in a press release Wednesday 
shortly after United Technologies asked for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrol, which makes switches and other electronic components, leased a new 
building in City of Industry from Bixby Ranch in 1965. Inspectors discovered 
soil and water contamination at the nine-acre site in 1980 and blamed it on the 
solvents that Spectrol used to clean its machinery.  
</P>
<P>
 United admitted its responsibility and agreed to pay for the cleanup. Toxics 
turned up again in 1987 and United again agreed to clean them up -- a job that 
could take until 1997 to complete, according to court documents.  
</P>
<P>
 Spectrol moved out in 1990 after the unit was sold by United Technologies, but 
the conglomerate remained liable for the cleanup. Bixby then sued in 1992, 
claiming that no other company would rent a building that sat on land that was 
still contaminated.  
</P>
<P>
 Adding the unusual twist, Bixby asked for additional damages because the 
toxics had "permanently stigmatized" the property's reputation and had hurt its 
resale value. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury awarded Bixby $400,000 for lost rental income and $865,000 for what 
its lawyers call the property's "permanent post-cleanup stigma." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't rent the property out now, and the only way we could sell it is if 
we marked it way down," said attorney Lawrence Teplin of Cox, Castle & 
Nicholson, which represented Bixby.

SUPREME COURT HEARS CABLE DISPUTE; MEDIA: THE INDUSTRY WANTS THE COURT TO 
STRIKE DOWN 'MUST-CARRY' RULES THAT REQUIRE SYSTEMS TO USE LOCAL BROADCASTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in a highly significant First 
Amendment dispute between the cable TV industry and local broadcasters, but the 
justices gave little hint as to how they will rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the cable operators are asking the court to strike down a 1992 law 
requiring them to carry the signals of nearly all local broadcast stations. 
</P>
<P>
 They contend that the requirement violates their free-press rights to carry 
only the programming they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called must-carry rule "overrides all editorial discretion," said H. 
Bartow Farr, representing Turner Broadcasting System in its challenge to the 
Cable TV Consumer Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. Solicitor Gen. Drew Days countered that in passing the law, Congress 
had responded properly to clear evidence that cable operators now hold a 
life-or-death grip over local broadcasters. Last year, about 60% of American 
households subscribed to cable TV, but they generally had only one choice of 
cable company. 
</P>
<P>
 This local cable monopoly creates a "bottleneck" that, if unregulated, could 
permit these operators to choke off independent local TV stations, Days said. 
If a cable operator drops a local station, the station instantly loses more 
than half its viewers and probably will go out of business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a U.S. appellate court here upheld the law, deeming it "economic 
regulation" that was well within the power of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But the justices questioned Days more skeptically, suggesting that a majority 
might strike down the law as unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The law creates "a favored class of speakers," said Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor, by demanding that a cable operator give preference to a local 
broadcast station, when doing so might edge out an even more desirable national 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable operators have a key precedent on their side. In 1974, the court 
struck down as unconstitutional a Florida law that gave disgruntled newspaper 
readers a "right to reply" to stories or editorials that mentioned them. Under 
the First Amendment, the government cannot compel "a newspaper to print that 
which it would not otherwise print," the court said in Miami Herald vs. 
Tornillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing themselves to newspapers, the cable companies said they cannot be 
compelled to carry certain stations.

MESA SETTLES LONG-RUNNING UNOCAL SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Turning out the footlights on a brief but blazing 1985 takeover attempt, Mesa 
Inc., the Dallas energy company run by Boone Pickens, agreed Wednesday to pay 
more than $42 million to settle a long-running lawsuit with Unocal Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil suit -- the last to be resolved of the dozens brought in the wake of 
Pickens' run at Unocal -- was brought by a suspicious shareholder and later 
joined by Unocal. It charged that Pickens had broken U.S. securities laws by 
buying and selling substantial amounts of stock during a period when he was 
considered an insider of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's settlement, totaling $47.5 million, gives Unocal less than a third 
of what the oil company was seeking. Mesa, formerly known as Mesa Petroleum, 
will pay $42.8 million and third parties are to pay the remaining $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit arose after a bitter, three-month battle turned into a personal 
grudge match between Pickens and Unocal's strong-willed chairman, Fred Hartley, 
and left Unocal hip deep in billions of dollars of debt -- a legacy from which 
the company is still recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when oil companies were awash in cash from $30-a-barrel crude, 
Pickens draped himself in the rhetoric of the aggrieved outside shareholder. He 
denounced both Unocal's return to shareholders and Hartley perquisites such as 
having a piano on the company plane. 
</P>
<P>
 A pivotal court decision against Pickens was "a real killer blow to the 
shareholders in corporate America," the Texan protested during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley was not easily cowed. Ultimately, though, Unocal -- in what many 
described as a case of "greenmail" -- offered to buy back its shares from Mesa 
in exchange for secured notes at higher-than-market prices. Unocal management 
had fought off Pickens -- but by acquiring $4.5 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the lawsuit settled Wednesday gone to trial as scheduled next month in 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, a familiar crew of '80s financial figures 
might have taken the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Financier Michael Milken, stock trader Ivan Boesky and brokerage chief Boyd 
Jefferies -- each convicted of financial wrongdoing during that decade -- would 
have been called as witnesses, according to Patrick Coughlin, a partner in the 
San Diego office of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which filed the suit 
against Mesa.  
</P>
<P>
 Milken "notified us last week that he intended to testify this time," Coughlin 
said Wednesday, "despite taking the Fifth Amendment when his deposition was 
taken in 1989. And Boyd Jefferies was coming. . . . And Boesky was within the 
jurisdiction and we intended to subpoena him." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charged that Pickens used Jefferies as his agent in assembling the 
block of Unocal shares at issue in the case. According to Coughlin, Jefferies 
-- who headed Los Angeles-based Jefferies & Co. -- bought the stock from 
Milken, Boesky and investor Irwin A. Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1985, Pickens dropped his takeover attempt and sold his Unocal stock 
-- including the shares addressed in the lawsuit, yielding a profit estimated 
by the plaintiffs at $99 million. 
</P>
<P>
 David Colan, a California engineer and Unocal stockholder, then brought civil 
suit against Mesa. Citing securities laws, he demanded that Pickens, as a 
Unocal insider, turn back to the company any profits from certain stock sales 
made within six months of the shares' purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bringing the Unocal litigation to an end as quickly as possible was critical 
for Mesa," Pickens said Wednesday. The company, he said, was thwarted from 
dealing with its own debt problem as long as "uncertainty" remained from the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mesa stock gained $1 to close at $7 a share Wednesday in New York 
Stock Exchange trading. Unocal closed down 37.5 cents at $28.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a decade after the bitter takeover attempt, the fortunes of Mesa and 
Unocal have taken different paths. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal still carries $3.4 billion in debt, but the company has drastically 
restructured and has rebounded with growing profits. For the third quarter of 
1993, Unocal posted net earnings of $70 million, up from $11 million in the 
third quarter of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wednesday's settlement, the much smaller Mesa is $1.3 billion in debt. 
For the third quarter, it lost more than $27 million, compared to a $29-million 
loss in that period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 And Pickens' United Shareholders Assn. -- the shareholders' rights group he 
set up during his takeover days -- quietly ceased operating two weeks ago.

PEOPLE; LARGO CEO IS MOVING TO UNIVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Film producer Lawrence Gordon resigned Wednesday as chief executive of Largo 
Entertainment -- the first major Hollywood venture backed by Japanese money 
during the free-spending 1980s -- for an exclusive production deal at Universal 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The move had been expected for weeks, as rumors circulated in Hollywood that 
Largo was running out of cash due to a dearth of hits and a financial drain 
from overhead costs. In an interview, Gordon would not discuss specifics except 
to say he wants to get back to making movies instead of running a company. He 
also denied persistent talk that Largo is on its last legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Largo still has the ability to finance movies, still has projects in 
development and still has two films to release, so I don't think Largo is out 
of business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Co. of Japan (JVC), which backed Gordon with $100 million in 1989, 
after he produced "Die Hard" and "Field of Dreams," said Largo will continue to 
operate and that the subsidiary will be restructured. Gordon will oversee the 
releasing of Largo's "The Getaway," with Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, and the 
Jean-Claude Van Damme film "Time-cop." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Largo has been unable to get the money to make the kind of 
big-budget films that have the best chance of becoming box office hits. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, it had to give up some projects, such as the upcoming "Die Hard 
3" and the Kevin Costner film "Waterworld." 
</P>
<P>
 Largo's track record was also generally weak. The company had a hit in 
"Unlawful Entry," but it has suffered from a string of disappointments with 
"The Super," "Dr. Giggles" and, most recently, "Judgment Night." 
</P>
<P>
 JVC's deal with Gordon, who was president of 20th Century Fox from 1984 to 
1986, was front-page news because, at the time, it was the biggest and boldest 
move by a Japanese company to back film production in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Sony Corp. has bought Columbia Pictures and Tristar Pictures, and 
Matsushita Electric Industrial -- which controls JVC -- has bought Universal 
parent MCA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The days of free spending on the part of Japanese companies quickly came to an 
end as the Japanese economy soured in the early 1990s, and that made money 
tighter for Largo, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because JVC is controlled by MCA owner Matsushita, there has been talk that 
Gordon's move was orchestrated by the Japanese electronics giant. But MCA 
Motion Picture Group Chairman Tom Pollock denied rumors that Matsushita 
orchestrated Gordon's move. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Larry's and (JVC's) decision . . . and I wanted to be in business with 
Larry Gordon," Pollock said.

TROUBLED STAR TV SEES FAST GROWTH IN ASIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, the media mogul's big gamble in pan-Asian satellite 
broadcasting, appears to be off to a promising start despite recent cutbacks, 
management turmoil and censorship problems in some countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Murdoch bought a 64% stake in Star TV for $545 million. The 
acquisition gave his global News Corp. an opening in the world's 
fastest-growing TV market, which encompasses more than 2.5 billion people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Star TV disclosed that it is now available to about 42 million 
homes, from China to Saudi Arabia, up from about 11 million households just 10 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase was encouraging enough that Star TV has made plans to start a pay 
TV channel in India and the Middle East within 12 months. The channel would 
feature movies from the 20th Century Fox film library, the motion picture and 
TV studio controlled by Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Star TV is expected to renegotiate its contract to 
carry the British Broadcasting Co. news channel, because some local governments 
don't want foreign news reports beamed into their countries, company officials 
said. Star TV hopes to replace the BBC news channel with a documentary and 
educational channel the two companies jointly own. 
</P>
<P>
 Star TV carries MTV, a sports channel, the BBC's World Service TV, a general 
entertainment channel and a Chinese-language channel. It also owns 49% of Z TV, 
a Hindi-language channel, and is in the advanced stages of acquiring a second 
ad-supported channel in India.  
</P>

 "I'm very happy with the results," Murdoch said. "There has been a great 
take-up rate in the peripheral countries, like Saudi Arabia and (South) Korea, 
but the big thing is China, where there is a very determined government policy 
to build cable." 
</P>

 Star TV now reaches more than 30 million homes in China, according to a survey 
conducted by Frank Small & Associates in association with the Chinese State 
Statistical Bureau. In India, Star TV reaches 7 million homes; in Taiwan it is 
seen in 2.4 million households. In South Korea, its range has expanded to 
183,000 homes from 19,000 in June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are gratified about these results because they show a demand for TV in the 
region," said Sam Chisholm, the News Corp. director who oversees Star TV and 
BSkyB, Murdoch's satellite TV service in Britain. "It's an endorsement of our 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Star TV may have been compelled to release the survey results to quell fears 
that the five-channel service was running into management problems. Last week, 
Jim Griffiths, a former Fox TV executive, resigned as head of Star after five 
months in the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just didn't work out," Chisholm said, declining to elaborate. "It's a 
difficult job." Star TV has fired 130 employees since Murdoch took over, 
reducing its staff from 750 to 620, Chisholm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffiths was replaced by Gary Davey, a News Corp. executive from BSkyB.

CAA TEAMS UP WITH FIRM THAT REPRESENTS JOURNALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a further blending of entertainment and news, Hollywood's Creative Artists 
Agency said Wednesday that it is linking up with the nation's top company 
representing broadcast journalists to develop potential specials, talk shows, 
interactive programs, videos and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture links the Beverly Hills-based CAA talent agency with N.S. 
Bienstock, a New York firm led by Richard Leibner and Carole Cooper that 
represents such broadcasters as Diane Sawyer, Dan Rather, Mike Wallace and 
Maria Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
 CAA Chairman Michael Ovitz said the deal was prompted in part by the expected 
explosion in demand for programs as the number of television channels multiply. 
Nonfiction programs will become "critically important to every distribution 
system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One limitation could be the availability of some network stars, who are often 
under exclusive contracts. However, Leibner said that as contracts expire, more 
broadcast journalists may seek greater freedom to explore other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the possibilities are talk shows developed and packaged for news 
figures. Or a TV director could be linked up with a broadcast journalist for a 
nonfiction project. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing links between journalists and entertainment have come under 
criticism frequently from news purists who believe the two areas should be as 
separate as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leibner called concern that such links threaten journalism "horse 
feathers," saying they merely increase the number of options available to news 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people who want to be journalists will continue to be journalists," he 
said. "Those who want to do popular entertainment will do more popular 
entertainment."

 Bloom Is Off Revlon-Perfumania Merger: Perfumania Inc. said its 
three-months-long merger talks with a Revlon Consumer Products Corp. unit have 
collapsed.Perfumania Chairman Ilia Lekach said the Miami-based company is 
instead discussing selling its $56-million-a-year retail business with Revlon 
and two other companies. Lekach said he wants to sell the company's 148 
cosmetics stores, which have been largely unprofitable, and hold on to the more 
lucrative wholesale business. Miami-based Perfumania's discussions of a merger 
with Revlon's Prestige Fragrance & Cosmetics unit fell through because New 
York-based Revlon wanted Perfumania's retail business, not the whole company, 
Lekach said.

 London Fog to Merge With Pacific Trail: The move would extend London Fog's 
lead in the rainwear and outerwear markets. Terms of the transaction were not 
disclosed.London Fog Corp., owned by Merrill Lynch & Co.'s venture capital 
subsidiary, said it has signed a letter of intent to merge with Pacific Trail's 
parent, PTI Holding Corp. The combined company could have 1994 revenue of about 
$500 million, London Fog said. The new company would be called London Fog 
Corp., though Pacific Trail Inc. would keep its management and brand name as it 
operates as a division of London Fog. Seattle-based Pacific Trail, owned by GKH 
Partners L.P. of Chicago, is expected to post 1993 sales of about $60 million. 
London Fog, based in Eldersburg, Md., had sales of about $350 million.

 New Card Takes Aim at Business Purchasing Market: American Express Co. 
unveiled its first new card in seven years, one designed to grab a share of the 
$250 billion companies spend on small purchases every year.The American Express 
Corporate Purchasing Card takes aim at the costly and inefficient process many 
large corporations use to make purchases of $1,000 or less, for example, to buy 
supplies such as staplers and computer paper. Visa International, the bank card 
association that is a major competitor of American Express, said it found 
little new in the announcement. Visa's 6-year-old purchasing card project has 
sales volume exceeding $1 billion a year and is growing rapidly.

 MGM Files Separation Suit: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has sued producer Arnon 
Milchan, his New Regency Productions and other offshore companies for breach of 
contract and fraud in Los Angeles County Superior Court.The studio claims 
Milchan, the co-producer of its film "Six Degrees of Separation," reneged on 
paying $8.05 million for foreign distribution rights as outlined in its 
agreement. "MGM is going to be like a heat-seeking missile on Mr. Milchan's 
assets," said Pierce O'Donnell, MGM's attorney. Milchan's representatives say 
the movie was part of a bigger multi-picture agreement with the studio, which 
they say MGM and its owner, French bank Credit Lyonnais, are reneging on.

 $28-Million Verdict Against Transamerica A Los Angeles jury hit the former 
Transamerica Insurance Co. with the bad-faith verdict for failing to make good 
on surety bonds after the contractor on a Malibu condominium project went 
bust.When the contractor abandoned the project and went out of business, 
Transamerica refused to pay for its completion. In the ensuing legal action, an 
arbitrator ruled that Transamerica had breached its bond contracts and awarded 
developer Talbot Partners $4,098,000 in damages and legal fees. Then, in a 
separate bad-faith trial, a Superior Court jury assessed the $28-million 
punitive judgment. Transamerica Insurance, formerly based in Woodland Hills, 
has since separated from Transamerica Corp., moved to New York and renamed 
itself TIG Holdings.

 Fisher-Price Plans 100 Layoffs: The toy maker said it is eliminating the 
white-collar jobs as a result of its being taken over by El Segundo-based 
Mattel Inc. The employees affected are mostly in the company's accounting, 
computer and market research departments, said Donna Gibbs, a spokeswoman for 
Mattel.Mattel completed its $1.24-billion buyout of rival Fisher-Price last 
Nov. 30. The positions being eliminated overlap with others held by Mattel 
workers, Gibbs said. All of the jobs being lost are at Fisher-Price's East 
Aurora, N.Y., headquarters, where about 850 workers will remain. Since 1990, 
Fisher-Price has eliminated more than half of 3,400 jobs in East Aurora.

BOND YIELDS DROP; DOW DECLINES 1.68

<P>
 Market Overview * Long-term bond market yields plummeted Wednesday, pushing 
prices sharply higher, after the government reported producer prices remained 
in check last month -- a sign that inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stock prices ended mixed, encouraged by falling interest rates but held down 
in part by tumbling share prices in Europe. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield fell to 6.175% from Tuesday's closing 
of 6.23%, boosting its price 25/32 point, or $7.81 per $1,000 in face value. 
Prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy rally began after the Labor Department reported that its producer 
price index, which measures inflationary pressures before they reach the 
consumer, fell 0.1%. For the year, the index rose a slight 0.2%. It was the 
best performance in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 This was good news to the bond market, since inflation erodes the value of 
fixed-income securities. But the enormity of the market's reaction -- the 
30-year issue was up more than a point at midday -- puzzled some economists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure seemed like the (producer price index) report was in line with market 
expectations," said Mark Green, an economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Added economist Robert Brusca: "There was some bad news in this report that 
was completely shrugged off by the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International Inc., said the 
producer price report, excluding its volatile energy component, rose 0.5% in 
each of the last two months. The December report shows that a sharp drop in 
gasoline prices more than offset a rise in the price of food. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Stocks started Wednesday solidly higher with good news on inflation and a 
strong bond market, tumbled at about the time European stocks closed at their 
lows for the day, then recovered late in the session. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow closed down 1.68 points, at 3,848.63, on Big Board 
volume totaling 310.69 million shares. Advancing issues outnumbered declining 
ones about 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the seventh straight 
session in which more than 300 million shares were traded. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in bond rates helped stocks. Lower rates usually encourage stock 
investors because they make share prices more appealing and cut the cost of 
borrowing for companies. Still, stocks spent much of Wednesday lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities Corp., said 
the fall in stock prices coincided with the European markets closing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a sympathetic response to selling overseas," Canelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although in Tokyo, the Nikkei average closed up 308.63 points at 18,793.88, 
London's Financial Times 100-share average fell 41.8, or 1.22%, to 3,372.0. 
Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average closed down 19.57 points at 2,209.18. Stocks 
also closed sharply lower in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in foreign trading, Mexico City's Bolsa index rose 10.77 points to 
2,565.33 after President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced he had ordered 
army troops to cease firing in the uprising in Chiapas state, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 443.08 points to close at 10,712.73. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks rallied after a trade group reported strong demand for 
semiconductors in December. First Boston also upgraded 15 semiconductor stocks, 
to "buy" from "hold." Among the winners were Intel, up 1 5/8 to 68 3/8, 
Motorola; ahead 2 1/2 to 94 3/4; Texas Instruments, up 3 1/4 to 70 1/4, and 
National Semiconductor, up 3/4 to 18 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meanwhile, oil company stocks were depressed by the latest drop in crude oil 
prices. Chevron fell 7/8 to 89 7/8; Texaco was off 3/8 to 65 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merry-Go-Round fell 7/8 to 1 3/4. The apparel company said Monday it filed a 
voluntary petition for protection and reorganization under Chapter 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Express fell 1/8 to 30 5/8 after it unveiled the American Express 
Corporate Purchasing Card. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell against most other currencies, caught in cross-trading between 
the German mark and a surging British pound, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, gold closed on the New York Comex at $386.30 an ounce, off $1.70 
from Tuesday; silver closed at $5.075 an ounce, down 3.4 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit taking in heating oil triggered a sharp drop in crude oil futures on 
the New York Merc. Light, sweet crude for February delivery fell 52 cents to 
$14.33 a barrel.

VONS PLANS LOWER PRICES, IMPROVED SERVICE TO HELP SALES; SUPERMARKETS: THE 
SOUTHLAND'S LARGEST GROCERY CHAIN SAYS IT WILL ALSO STEP UP ADVERTISING IN WAKE 
OF REVENUE DECLINE.

<P>
 Faced with declining sales, Vons Cos. on Wednesday said it will improve 
service in its stores and permanently lower prices on thousands of products 
under a program that begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arcadia-based supermarket operator also said it will significantly expand 
its advertising in local media as part of a new marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons said prices on 3,300 to 8,700 products will be reduced -- depending on 
the location of the store -- but it did not disclose the level of the price 
cuts. The company said it is also authorizing store managers to increase the 
hours of employees to improve service and shorten the waiting period in 
checkout lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is developing a new marketing approach in response to a drop in 
sales, said Douglas Christopher, an industry analyst at Crowell, Weedon & Co. 
in Los Angeles. Sales for the 40-week period ended Oct. 10 were $3.9 billion, 
down from $4.2 billion for the same period the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will release the results of its final quarter Feb. 24.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that this program focuses on sales," Christopher said. "They're 
trying to build more sales and consistent customer counts. Price cutting is 
just a part of their promotions strategy. They're becoming more aggressive, and 
that's positive." 
</P>
<P>
 The staffing increases and price cuts will take place only at the 307 stores 
operating under the Vons name. In all, the company operates 345 stores under 
the Vons, Pavilions, Tianguis and Expo formats in California and Nevada.

 Vons, the Southland's largest supermarket chain, in November announced plans 
to lay off about 250 administrative workers and close 11 poorly performing 
stores to create savings that could be used to cut prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vons has reinvested millions of dollars in cost savings realized from our 
recent restructuring into areas customers told us were important," Vons 
Chairman Roger Stangeland said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers told us they wanted better prices every day, better customer 
service and better promotions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The markdowns are already in effect at a new Vons store in Compton, which 
opened Wednesday amid much fanfare.

AROUND THE VALLEY: TRIP TO DOGGIE WASH WITH COLOSSAL CANINE IS A HAIRY ORDEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It probably started with those do-it-yourself carwash places, where you drop 
about a dozen quarters in a slot and blast your car with a high-powered water 
nozzle like some carwash Rambo. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came restaurants where you cook your own steak. (But if you wind up with 
a charcoal briquette for a meal, do you stiff yourself out of a tip?) 
</P>
<P>
 So what's next? A concert where you write your own symphony? A psychiatrist's 
office where you lie on a couch and tell yourself about your terrible 
childhood? 
</P>
<P>
 These sarcastic thoughts boiled up in my head recently when I drove past 
U-Wash Doggie, a do-it-yourself dog- and cat-grooming shop in my Studio City 
neighborhood. Has society come to the point where we need a special location to 
shampoo our Shih Tzus? 
</P>
<P>
 Unless your pet is a Clydesdale or boa constrictor the size of a telephone 
pole, put the smelly little bugger in the bathtub and scrub. What's the big 
deal? 
</P>
<P>
 But being a sensitive, '90s kinda guy, I decided not to cast stones until I 
had investigated. After all, most of my pet experience has been with a cat that 
takes care of his own personal hygiene. The day I have to help lick his fur is 
the day he goes to the violin factory. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why I found myself one day recently in the doggie wash, being 
introduced to a colleague's 85-pound border collie mix named Pikku. The name 
supposedly comes from the Finnish word for "small," but this animal was the 
size of a Shetland pony with hair like Don King. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew immediately there would be trouble when Pikku yelped and struggled as 
her owner wrestled her through the shop's door, grunting: "He hates baths." 
</P>
<P>
 "Great," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Fancisco Gamero, who launched the U-Wash Doggie business three years ago, 
explained that for $10 to $14, depending on poochie's size, you get the use of 
an apron, shampoo, a bathtub, brushes and an industrial-strength hair dryer. Or 
for $20 to $40, you can drop off your putrid pooch and the shop does the dirty 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamero explained that he got the idea when he was having troubles washing his 
golden retriever in his bathtub years ago, deciding that "if I'm having 
problems with my dog myself, other people are too." 
</P>
<P>
 ("Problems?" Like what? I was soon to learn.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gamero opened his first shop in Santa Clarita. The messy-mutt biz grew so 
rapidly that he sold partnerships for shops in Studio City and Burbank and 
plans to open several more, including one in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not alone in this business. Shops with names like E-Z Pet Wash and My 
Beautiful Dog-O-Mat have sprouted all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 My first problem was getting Pikku into the tub, which was about 3 feet off 
the ground so I wouldn't need to bend over to scrub her. Gamero offered a 
stepladder specially made to get mutts into the tub. Pikku would have nothing 
to do with it. She just sat on the floor, staring at the tub, eyes rolling in 
terror. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Pikku's owner lifted the dog into the tub. I chained her to the side 
to keep her from squirming around. 
</P>
<P>
 I was ready to fire a burst from the hose when Janet Benedict, one of the shop 
owners, suggested that I first comb off excess hair with a soft wire brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh sure, great idea. By the time my arm grew tired of brushing, I had about 10 
pounds of hair in the tub, on the brush, on my hands and in the tub's drain. 
But Pikku could still audition for the woolly mammoth role in the next 
cave-people flick. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I got Pikku sudsed down, she did what comes natural to wet dogs: She 
shook, hurling gobs of suds and long, coarse dog hairs in all directions. My 
white sweat shirt looked like a sort of odd, gray wool anorak. 
</P>
<P>
 Benedict had taught me a trick to keep dogs from shaking -- just lift one of 
the dog's front legs so she would be too unbalanced to shake. This had no 
affect on Pikku, an incredibly well-balanced dog who could have gone on shaking 
if I hung her upside down from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, I wouldn't do that (because I couldn't do that), but she howled as if I 
had. Long, loud howls that pierced eardrums for miles, baying worthy of an 
entire pack of heartbroken hounds. I could see the headlines in my own 
newspaper: "Reporter Arrested for Canine Cruelty; Editor Promises Animal Rights 
Groups Instant Dismissal." 
</P>
<P>
 Benedict lowered the noise level by tossing dog treats in Pikku's muzzle every 
time she began to howl. 
</P>
<P>
 Several shakes and howls later, I was ready to hit Pikku with the 
industrial-strength hair drier that was supposed to dry off the average head 
(human, not canine) in five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pikku's furry bulk soaked up about 20 minutes, more time than I need to wash 
and dry a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The final touch: cologne. Gamero sprayed Pikku with a delicate aroma sure to 
drive the male dogs in the neighborhood mad with passion. 
</P>
<P>
 So there's Pikku, fluffy and shiny and smelling like the perfume counter at 
Sak's. 
</P>
<P>
 And here's me, looking like I had been dipped in tar and dragged through a 
toupee shop. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when it struck me. The tub. 
</P>
<P>
 The tub was lined on all sides with long black hairs that formed groovy little 
designs like those on the tie-dye shirts we all wore in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "A disaster," Pikku's owner agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at that tub, I realized why do-it-yourself pet grooming shops are the 
Amgen, the Apple Computer, the boom biz of the '90s. I may have been a mess, 
but at least when I got home, I could clean up in a tub that does not look like 
it is lined with gray shag carpet.

CAL STATE FULLERTON TEACHER HOPES HIS 'URBAN OUTHOUSE' TAKES PRIVY DISCUSSION 
PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It looks like something the Apollo astronauts left on the lunar surface, but 
its antecedents were about as low-tech as low-tech gets. What, after all, could 
be more primitive than the little shed with the crescent moon on the door? 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Cantley's take on the outhouse features a crescent moon, too. But it 
also features a bank of photoelectric cells, full automation, a gravity flow 
flushing system, chemical waste breakdown, doors controlled by hydraulic 
pistons, and the ability to pull itself to pieces when the occupant's quarter 
runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantley, an assistant professor of environmental design at Cal State 
Fullerton, calls his version of the venerable Paris pissoir "reaction 
architecture" and speculates that the reason that he hasn't heard a word from 
the judges in the recent "urban outhouse" design competition in New York is 
that reaction to the model for the structure may have been a bit severe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have actually scared the jury members," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is fine with Cantley. The design, which was produced through exchanges 
of phone calls, faxes and computer information with Cantley's partner in 
Atlantic City, designer Kevin O'Donnell, was not meant to be a true contender 
in the competition but was meant to stimulate thinking, to open minds to 
possibilities in the arena of public sanitation, said Cantley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the shock value will have a lot to do with educating designers and 
the general public," he said. And a bad reaction to it is not necessarily a bad 
thing. We were just looking for reactions, period. We approached this with a 
lot of humor, but it's a very real topic. We take our design very seriously, 
but we don't take ourselves very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair also took the reason for the competition seriously. Sponsored by the 
Vermont Structural Slate Co., the "urban outhouse" design contest, which took 
place early last year was intended to coax designers, planners, engineers and 
architects into producing models for an amenity that is seriously lacking in 
American city life: the public restroom. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 applications were mailed out, and 309 designs for 
self-cleaning facilities were sent in by May. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for a public restroom that can take the punishment of city streets 
has become acute, according to urban planners. As the number of homeless people 
increases in cities, more city alleys and streets have begun to reek of human 
waste. Many existing city restrooms have been closed because of the vandalism, 
drug-dealing, prostitution and other crimes that routinely take place inside 
them, and budgets for many new public structures don't allow for restrooms at 
all. Los Angeles' new subway is one. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, private facilities such as restaurants and hotels have become 
besieged in many areas. And if homeless people are turned away from those 
places, the only alternative is the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, planners are looking to the idea of the free-standing 
street-side restroom facility, and Cantley is looking to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 His model, he said, "is probably 10 years down the road" in terms of 
technology and affordability, but that didn't stop him and O'Donnell from 
pushing the outside of the basic plumbing and structural envelope. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The model looks like almost anything except what it actually is. Cantley 
compared it to the Transformer or Go-Bot toys that drastically change their 
shape with the movement of a few panels. Which is exactly what happens with his 
urban outhouse. The potential user enters the restroom proper by ascending a 
small ramp emblazoned with a crescent moon icon and inserts money -- or 
possibly a "debit card," said Cantley -- in a slot. At that moment, hydraulic 
pistons are activated that pull the walls of the structure together and raise 
the ramp to form an enclosed room around the occupant. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the user is presented with not only a conventional toilet and sink 
but, said Cantley, a condom dispenser. While the business at hand is going on, 
the occupant also is presented with a bit of video distraction in the form of 
brief advertisements that play on a monitor set into one of the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nike or Coke might pay a pretty penny to have a captive audience for about 
three minutes," said Cantley. 
</P>
<P>
 (A second, far larger "digitized display" is attached to the outside of the 
structure and plays continuous ads that can be seen by pedestrians and drivers 
passing by.) 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the toilet is flushed using collected rainwater and a gravity feed 
system, solid waste is broken down in a holding tank by chemicals and any 
methane gas is automatically drawn away. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything is powered, said Cantley, by the sun, through the use of 
photoelectric cells fitted into a halo-like device above the roof of the 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 When the occupant is ready, a button is pushed, and the entire structure 
unfolds -- or "deconstructs," as Cantley says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to see what would happen when the whole building deconstructs 
itself after you're done," said Cantley. "The whole thing's automated, so we 
figured we might as well go whole hog and have fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
 A plus: Unless more money is fed into the slot, the structure will unfold, 
ready or not. This means, said Cantley, that it won't become a haven for drug 
dealers and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But will it work? Theoretically, said Cantley. What will it cost? "We have no 
idea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, Cantley and O'Donnell are content to let their urban 
outhouse snap heads around and cause a few heads to either shake or nod. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really dealing with the MTV generation here," said Cantley. "We're 
trying to change people's ideas of what they think design is about. We could 
see this on the 'Blade Runner' set quite easily. We want people to be curious 
and to come up to it and check it out." People will have a chance to do just 
that in February. The design has been accepted for display at the 15th 
international "Making Cities Livable" conference in San Francisco. Sponsored by 
the Carmel-based Center for Urban Well-Being, an international organization of 
mayors, city council members, architects, social scientists and other 
professionals involved in urban planning, the conference showcases the most 
innovative new designs applicable to an urban environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantley's design was not included in the conference displays at first, said 
Suzanne Crowhurst Lennard, the director of the center, but Cantley's 
persistence and a second look at the design changed a few minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We suggested that his design was at rather too early a stage to be 
appropriate for the exhibit, and we urged him to develop it a bit more before 
submitting it to the conference," said Lennard. "It was very futuristic. But he 
was very eager to display it, and we felt that if it were developed more 
practically it might be useful, so we accepted it."

CREATING THE SOUND OF MUSIC; PRACTICAL VIEW: WANT YOUR CHILD'S LESSONS TO START 
ON A HIGH NOTE? EXPERTS OFFER ADVICE ON INSTRUMENTS AND TEACHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The world is full of people who remember what their parents told them when 
they balked at music lessons: "Someday you'll be sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother made me sign a piece of paper that said, 'I am not now, and never 
will be, sorry that I stopped taking piano lessons,' " says Anita Goldstein, 
who directs public relations projects at USC. "I love music now, even piano 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 Music can be a lifetime gift, but it doesn't come easily, says Richard Cohen, 
a child psychologist and director of the Pacific Oaks College Research Center 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids these days mostly get good at playing CDs," he says. "They are divorced 
from the actual act of playing an instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 Most children used to study music early in their public school years, but 
parents can no longer expect that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have a music teacher in every school," says Don Dustin, director 
of performing arts for the Los Angeles Unified School District's 650,000 
students. "Now we offer instrumental instruction on a rotating basis in 125 of 
our 430 elementary schools at any given time. That's a big drop." 
</P>
<P>
 That means parents who want their youngsters to learn to play an instrument 
are left pretty much to their own resources, he says. For the uninformed, the 
array of methods, philosophies and instruments can be daunting. Private 
lessons? Suzuki method? Should you start with the piano? How can you tell if 
the teacher is any good? Should you force a child to practice? 
</P>
<P>
 "There is such a need for information," says Marienne Uszler, a member of the 
USC piano faculty and editor of the Music Teachers National Assn. Journal. 
"More than ever, parents want to provide music for their children, but they 
don't have a clue about finding a teacher or choosing an instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 Uszler, who is writing a book to help parents launch their children in music, 
joined several other music education experts in offering some general 
guidelines:  
</P>
<P>
 * What's the best age to begin music lessons? 
</P>
<P>
 There is no consensus, although most experts agree a home where music is 
played is effective even for infants.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a language -- the earlier you start, the more proficient you will 
become," says violin teacher Lorraine Fink of Sherman Oaks, who suggests 
starting children on violin at age 4. The Japanese Suzuki method enrolls 
children as young as 3 in group classes with pint-sized stringed instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 To play the piano, which requires more mature eye-hand coordination, the first 
grade is generally considered a good age to start. Band and orchestra 
instruments can be started in early grades, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, if kids start later -- even in their early teens -- they 
really focus," says Ken Grayson, manager of Grayson's Tune Town in Montrose, a 
music store that provides teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Should a parent insist? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's devastating for a kid to be made to take music lessons if they don't 
want to," says Uszler. With a preschooler, the parents make the decision, but 
by the age of 6, the child needs to be consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Music is also a commitment for parents. Joe Thayer, dean of the Colburn School 
of Performing Arts in Los Angeles, says, "Our biggest drop-off in the 
introductory classes is the kid who didn't want to come in the first place or 
the parent who didn't want to give up Saturday morning. They hadn't really 
talked it over." 
</P>
<P>
 Music educator Nadia Lawrence of Santa Monica, whose doctoral dissertation 
analyzed children's music practice and drop-out problems in 240 families, 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what instrument you choose, you should make a long-term plan 
involving the parents, the student and the teacher," she says. "Agree that 
you're going to stick with the child through all the ups and downs -- and know 
that the roughest times will probably be early adolescence when kids start 
getting really busy." 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you choose an instrument? 
</P>
<P>
 "Choose the instrument first and the teacher second and in both cases spend a 
lot of time on the decision," says Uszler. "Most parents spend more time buying 
a new car or television than a musical instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 She suggests showing children tapes that illustrate what instruments look like 
and how they sound; attending a symphony or a band concert; sitting in on a 
rehearsal of the high school band. 
</P>
<P>
 Grayson says, "I tell parents straight up, as carefully as I can, without the 
child being caught in the middle, that lessons really work best when the child 
is pursuing the instrument he has the greatest interest in." 
</P>
<P>
 Uszler says personality type should be considered. "If you have a little shy, 
retiring girl, she is not going to play the trumpet." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other factors. String instruments require the player to produce his 
own pitch, unlike woodwind, brass or piano. That requires discriminating 
listening by the student.  
</P>
<P>
 And, Uszler adds, "you need to know what amount of care an instrument will 
take. Violin strings break, oboe reeds must be soaked, a harp is not only a 
huge financial commitment, you have to buy a station wagon big enough to cart 
it around."  
</P>
<P>
 Good quality electronic instruments can be attractive, Uszler says, because 
kids see all the pop stars playing them. "The trouble with the electronic 
market is a short supply of really good teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're saying here," Uszler emphasizes, "is that you should choose an 
instrument as carefully as your family doctor. Don't have your son play the 
saxophone just because you've got Uncle Joe's college saxophone in the attic. 
That's like giving him any old sloppy food to see if he likes to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you get an instrument? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't make a large investment until you know the instrument is going to take 
with the child, and don't buy any instrument until you have a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had beginning students show up with violins that are too big and 
trumpets with the valves stuck," says Ginny Atherton of La Crescenta, a flutist 
with extensive private and group teaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
 If the teacher suggests an expensive new instrument, find another teacher. 
What you want is "a good quality entry-level model," says Atherton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rental instruments are a good choice for beginners. "A decent used woodwind, 
brass or stringed instrument should cost between $13 and $20 a month," said 
David St. John, manager of Charles Music Store in Glendale. "New ones can range 
from $20 to $30 in rental a month. Saxophones (because they are bigger) are 
double the price of other woodwinds." 
</P>
<P>
 A cheap instrument will need constant work on keys, pads, pegs or casings. 
"The main thing is to get a quality instrument, whether used or new," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you find a teacher? 
</P>
<P>
 There are independent teachers for private or small group lessons and the 
group method systems like Suzuki and Yamaha. University programs and specialty 
schools provide performance opportunities. And many music stores provide 
studios for teachers and lists of recommended teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources are organizations of professional music teachers, college and 
university music departments and music conservatories. (See adjoining resource 
list). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still very haphazard at best," says Howard Richman, a piano teacher who 
gets so many inquiries he is publishing "Guide to L.A. Music Teachers" through 
his Sound Feelings Press in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware there are teachers who prefer beginners and others who work best with 
advanced students. Interview the teachers yourself, says Thayer. "Don't be 
intimidated if you don't know anything about music. Ask what their studies have 
been, how long they have been teaching and what kind of students they enjoy 
working with." 
</P>
<P>
 Other starting advice: Although six-month packages (teacher and rental 
instrument) are popular at music stores, be willing to pay for a couple of 
introductory private lessons, to see that the child, the instrument and the 
teacher are well matched. 
</P>
<P>
 "General rule for private lessons is about $25 a half hour," says Don Doyle, a 
school district music adviser. "It can go up or down depending on the city you 
live in and the reputation of the teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you encourage a child to practice? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rintoul, a professional musician and staff member at the Colburn 
school, teaches a class to help parents support their children's music 
education. "This is an instant-gratification society," he says. "People want to 
play an instrument. They don't want to practice." 
</P>
<P>
 He offers a few rules: 
</P>
<P>
 * Practice every day if only for 15 to 30 minutes. The cumulative effect is 
much greater than blitzing before a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Practice slowly and accurately. Take the piece apart for rhythm, intonation, 
sound and dynamics. "Kids don't like to do that," he says. "They are in a 
rush." 
</P>
<P>
 * Listen to what's being produced. For a more advanced student it's a great 
help to use a tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 All the experts agree practice is the major issue in most households, once the 
early glow wears off. "What you want to avoid," says Cohen, "is day-to-day 
arguments about practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be drudgery, but on the other hand if kids don't practice, they 
aren't going to progress," he says. "If the child plays in a group, that can be 
fun. There just needs to be some reason to practice."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever wonder what the two Ms in M&M's stand for? Or whether it's ketchup or 
catsup ? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, you're sure to relish Vince Staten's new book, "Can You Trust a Tomato 
in January?" 
</P>
<P>
 In this cook's tour de farce, Staten reveals deliciously ironic secrets of the 
American food industry (there's more lemon in Lemon Pledge furniture polish,

origins of food terms and brand names.

 The fictional Betty Crocker honors a company director named William Crocker. 
Sara Lee comes from Sara Lee Schupf, daughter of the bakery's founder.

 M&M's literally comes from Mars: the last names of Frank Mars, founder of Mars 
candy, and Bob Murrie, company president in 1941.

 Velveeta means "velvety cheese"; Tab helps you keep tabs on your weight, and 
exotic Haagen-Dazs was simply made up by the wife of a Bronx ice-cream maker.

 Likewise, 7Up , originally called "Bib-label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda," was 
christened by default after its inventor rejected six other names.

 Ketchup won over catsup when Del Monte finally capitulated in 1988, and Yankee

IN 2000: FUTURE STOCK; SORRY, CARS WON'T FLY OR WALK ON WATER. AND THEY'LL 
STILL SLURP UP GAS. BUT LOOK FOR MORE LUXURY, LIGHTER FRAMES AND BETTER VALUE.

<P>
 The Greater Los Angeles Auto Show gleams through Sunday then brakes its short, 
annual reach into motoring for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But at technical centers and styling studios from Michigan to La Jolla, 
tomorrow continues. Designers and computers already are building for the next 
century and know precisely what our monthly payments will buy in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly far enough into it that we can't talk about it," says Jerry 
Hirschberg, vice president of Nissan Design International of La Jolla. Nor will 
he allow photographs of his team's computer images. "But I can say it looks 
depressingly like a car. It has wheels. It doesn't fly. It's not at all like 
those coffee-table car books said it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say that despite the dictates of government, our turn-of-the-century 
motor cars will not be electric powered. Nor capable of traveling 80 miles on 
one gallon of gas. Certainly none will bear resemblance to the scientific, 
fictional, spacey, Odyssean vehicles of Arthur Clarke's 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 As lobbies move to unplug California's rigid electric vehicle legislation, 
cars powered by natural gas, propane or reformulated gasolines, will move to 
the ecological front. 
</P>
<P>
 Aluminum -- the perennial backbone of air and space travel -- will enjoy a new 
popularity in automobile construction. Shorter, lighter, narrower "City" cars 
will become popular with levels of comfort and quiet unknown to Yugo. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts predict air bags for every front seat and upmarket sedans offering 
optional back-seat bags by the end of the millennium. Air bags will be 
concealed in spaces no bigger than a fist, and will inflate into softer, better 
contoured and facially friendlier shapes the size of small comforters. 
</P>
<P>
 And anti-lock disc brakes will be standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be 47 million car phones in use, or four times the current total. 
That doesn't necessarily mean 47 million dawdlers and lane wanderers. For 21st 
Century car phones will be fumble-free and built into dashboards, with 
voice-activated dialing and integrated antennas sharing reception with the 
AM-FM radio. 
</P>
<P>
 And new windshields will aid night vision. 
</P>
<P>
 What looks like leather, squeaks like leather and smells like leather may very 
well be a tightly woven fabric. As there is keyless entry on 1994 cars, there 
could be keyless ignition 72 months from now. 
</P>
<P>
 And gas will only cost $2 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars are as long, as low and as wide as they will get, believes GM designer 
John Schinella. Tomorrow's buyers, he says, will want mid-size cars with 
brighter, more individual styling in fabrics, wheels and trim. Performance and 
handling will have a duality to satisfy young parents feeling for the safety of 
new families, and those driving alone and feeling their oats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, we haven't been paying too much attention to what the public wants 
in its automobiles," Schinella explains. "Now we're listening and hearing 
people asking for more substantial automobiles of high-end character for less 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the year 2000 they want cars that feel good, smell good, look good . . . 
and work perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schinella, here to chaperon Chevrolet's 1995 Lumina and Monte Carlo at the 
auto show, knows where new automotive technologies are stirring -- in high-tech 
aerospace and weapons laboratories where talents have been idled by defense 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You simply take that brilliance and sic it on to the problems of electronic 
drivetrains and lightweight materials that cost 50% less but wear 50% better," 
he adds. "On the other hand, the customer might say they want the whiz-bang 
stuff, but are they really for it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about keyless ignition. Keys are a symbol, rather like a collar and 
tie: They survive as an essential of clothing although they have little 
practical purpose. In that light, I think the buyer of 2000 wants evolutionary, 
not revolutionary change." 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers, however, just might be interested in an anti-theft microchip that will 
work in conjunction with a car's cellular phone system. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the car disappears, you call the phone and ask the car for Global 
Positioning Satellite information," says analyst and forecaster Herschel 
Shosteck, of Shosteck and Associates, Silver Spring, Md. "The car will tell 
you: 'Here I am. Come and get me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Nissan's Hirschberg believes, tomorrow's automotive developments will be 
restricted to "boldly evolutionary" in response to the consumer condition of 
"millenniumania." 
</P>
<P>
 Society on its anniversaries, he says, tends to look back and assess the best 
and worst of all things. The Top Ten of the last decade. The Dubious Dozen of 
the past half century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are approaching the end of a millennium. That has only happened once 
in Western culture, and I think it will impact us in very many ways," 
Hirschberg says. "I think by the year 2000 there will be a standing still, a 
taking stock, a looking back at what humanity has done and saying: 'Gee, we 
haven't come very far, have we?' 
</P>
<P>
 "People will realize that the Gods of science and technology haven't produced 
the Utopia we expected. People are weary of technology for technology's sake. 
Now they are asking: 'What is this product used for? What can it do for me? 
What does it not do for me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 So anticipate "a celebration not of the technology of cars, but a celebration 
of the people who are driving them . . . through human-oriented, low-tech 
devices indicating that a company is interested in people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like the ubiquitous cup holder. Like the smokeless car with ashtrays as 
options. Also servomechanisms for every dimension of movement within the car 
and every movement of the car. The kind of things that when people see them, 
they say: 'How nice, thank you. Why hasn't someone done that before?' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Clearly as important as what will be by the year 2000, is what will not. 
</P>
<P>
 One consensus among car makers, mavens and the media at the L. A. show is that 
sales of electric vehicles (EVs) will be shorting out in 2001. No matter that 
California has mandated zero-emission (i.e. electric) cars that must form 2% of 
new vehicle sales in 1998. Representatives of the Big Three and the Overseas 
Others say it simply can't be done. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Battery technology, they protest, hasn't budged in 90 years and crash programs 
are doing just that: crashing. They say it will be decades before affordable, 
safe, practical, efficient electric vehicles will be reducing Golden State 
Freeway traffic to a rush hour whine. 
</P>
<P>
 Grounded in fiscal realities, Ford announced Tuesday that it may scale back 
its electric vehicle program before pouring good money after bad battery 
technology. General Motors has already axed full production of its two-seat 
Impact EV. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the California Air Resources Board -- which ordered up the 2% solution 
as a well-intentioned effort to fight air pollution -- doesn't seem ready to 
blink. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Schafer, new chairwoman of the board, told an auto show luncheon 
that although the 1998 deadline would be reviewed this summer, she has this 
"bias toward retaining the rule" as a goad for EV technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Unimpressed, Assemblyman Bernie Richter (R-Chico) recently drafted a repeal. 
"The (EV) mandate is driven by ideology, not rationality," he says. "I'm not 
for pollution, but this is madness." 
</P>
<P>
 Not even EV builders are glowing with optimism for the rest of this century. 
At least, not when asked if their vehicles will contend in the car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Garzee, vice president of U.S. Electricar of Sebastapol, says companies 
within the Electricar consortium have built more than 55,000 EVs since 1946. 
But they remain niche vehicles such as "shuttle buses, utility company 
vehicles, meter maids . . . or second or third (personal) vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 He declines comment on EVs in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garzee predicts a "major movement toward AFVs (Alternative Fuel Vehicles) 
. . . if you want to move rapidly toward zero emissions." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jack Smith agrees. Naturally. He is marketing manager of natural gas vehicles 
(NGVs) for the Southern California Gas Co., which has counted 2,000 gas buggies 
operating from Paso Robles to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2000, predicts Smith, there will be 200,000 NGVs in Southern California. 
Purchase incentives and tax exemptions will wash costs of the conversion -- 
about $3,000 -- to natural gas, which runs the equivalent of 80 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 NGVs burn 90% cleaner and performance is on a par with gasoline cars. The only 
downside is reduced range -- less than 180 miles per tank for a Chrysler van -- 
owing to skimpy storage space. 
</P>
<P>
 But there already is a refueling infrastructure in place -- the 35,000 miles 
of pipelines that feed gas ranges in Los Angeles homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My vision for 1998 is to expand NGVs out of the fleet market and into the 
consumer market," Smith says. "The ultimate vision is an NGV in every garage 
and a refueling plant hooked into the gas system at every home." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Bernardino Sheriff's Office drives 100 natural gas patrol cars. 
Federal Express, Disneyland and Dy-Dee diaper service use NGVs. So how viable 
are such vehicles as an alternative to electric? 
</P>
<P>
 Says Smith: "Even (Southern California) Edison has a couple of natural gas 
vehicles." 
</P>
<P>

 Meanwhile, back at the drawing boards, there is a litter of ladybug cars 
leaning into the next century. Volkswagen has its two-door Concept 1 -- 
sketched at VW's design center in Simi Valley -- that will run on diesel or 
electric power. Writers already are claiming the Bug is back. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda has built one of these City cars. Even august, luxurious Mercedes-Benz 
has climbed down from its high horsepower to propose and display a snub-nosed, 
tall-tailed, hatchbacked cube for the 1998 model year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vision A is three feet shorter than the smallest Mercedes built today. 
Powered by diesel, gasoline or electricity, the car develops 75 horsepower and 
barely tops 90 m.p.h., but gets almost 50 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
 These shorter, narrower, slower, lighter and gas-stingier City cars, says 
Erich Krampe, a sales executive with Mercedes-Benz of Germany, are building "a 
trend that will emerge into a real demand for the turn of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 Not for the U.S., Britain or France, per se . But certainly for Los Angeles, 
London, Paris, he says, and any of the world's densely populated areas: "Unlike 
other very small cars, (they will offer) traveling comfort, sound proofing and 
a high level of safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Chairman Bob Eaton doesn't see a dramatic future for City cars, not 
even electrified ones. Not as long as gasoline remains an inexpensive fuel. Not 
as long as smaller engines become more powerful, cleaner and economical. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's also no political will to do anything (change) about it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then with all factors considered, why buy a City car? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right," Eaton says. "Who cares?" 
</P>

 Land Rover has built aluminum-bodied sport utilities since 1948. Acura's 
luxury NSX sports car is largely aluminum. The alloy is a contributor to the 
strength and speed of the military's chunky HumVee. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2001, says Jane Lichter of the Aluminum Assn., Washington, D.C., more 
mundane cars will be using aluminum -- and probably 500 pounds per vehicle 
compared to today's 190 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 At the L.A. show, Audi is displaying an all-aluminum space frame that will be 
the backbone and skeleton of its new A-8 luxury sedan. The car is said to be 
larger, lighter, stiffer, nimbler and stronger than its predecessor -- thanks 
to totally recyclable aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, such high-class skillet metal costs three times as much as 
steel and production is riddled with vagaries. Such as heating the completed 
body shell to more than 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes to optimize its 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lichter says it is the recyclability, and the profitability of the 
process, that is aluminum's deep allure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The infrastructure to recycle aluminum already exists . . . recycling 
aluminum saves 95% of the energy required for new aluminum . . . and 66% of 
aluminum in cars is now recycled," she explains. "Break down a car and you can 
sell the aluminum. You have to pay people to remove the other garbage." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Depressing though the reminder may be, baby boomers will be nearing retirement 
age by 2000. These consumers, says Jay Koblentz, publisher of Consumer Review, 
grew up in the van and sport utility era. He predicts they will demand luxury 
minivans "on car platforms, not truck frames: 
</P>
<P>
 "I see imminent-collision warnings, more anti-theft devices, and panic buttons 
you can press to lock the doors, flash the lights and sound the horn." 
</P>
<P>
 But what of highways and freeways to handle a vehicular population that is 
growing by growls and blockages? 
</P>
<P>
 "Start charging a lot of money to get on 'em," Koblentz suggests. "Maybe even 
a luxury lane where you pay your price and go faster. Of course, I don't know 
if the sign will say: 'BMWs Only.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wangers of Automobile Marketing Consultants in Vista, sees more common 
sense in tomorrow's vehicles. An increase in women buyers will produce kinder, 
gentler -- and definitely lower -- sport utility vehicles. Also door handles 
that don't break fingernails and less macho pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he says, "Everybody will still be fighting desperately to avoid price 
increases, because the consumer has had enough sticker shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Further growth in luxury cars and their equipment, he believes, is "very, very 
questionable. There's so much luxury these days in high-line, mid-size cars 
like the (Chrysler) Concorde, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Buick Regal and (Infiniti) 
J30 . . . that I'm not sure the three-pointed star (Mercedes) or blue-and-white 
emblem (BMW) justify spending $50,000 anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the new C-Class Mercedes is saying what America is telling us: 'Yes, 
we like Mercedes, but for $35,000, not $60,000.' The (Chrysler) LHS is not 
quite as plush as a $45,000 Lexus or BMW. But it takes a real sophisticated eye 
to tell the difference, and that difference just isn't worth $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
 If there are new buzzwords for the future of automobiles, they likely are 
"global integration." That's the system of partial subsidiaries and 
conglomerates by which Ford in the United States owns Jaguar of England and a 
large piece of Mazda in Japan, while the Ford Festiva actually is made by Kia 
of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 GM is a global player. 
</P>
<P>
 One division is working with its European partners on a smaller, less 
expensive luxury vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the LSE, which means Luxury Sedan Euro-Style. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2000, this quintessential American car could become the very first Cadillac 
built in Germany.

BOOKS & AUTHORS: NUMBER 15 MAKES A 'SHAMELESS' DEBUT; AFTER EIGHT YEARS AND 14 
ROMANCE NOVELS, SUZANNE FORSTER OF NEWPORT BEACH BRANCHES OUT WITH A SEXY 
COMMERCIAL EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Romantic Times magazine calls Newport Beach author Suzanne Forster's new 
novel, "Shameless," a "sizzling mainstream debut." 
</P>
<P>
 Her heroine is Jessie Flood, a young woman who scandalized the small 
California town where she grew up by implicating her friend Luc in a murder. 
She then married Luc's wealthy father -- a man 30 years her senior -- and 
inherited his vast media empire when he died. Jessie is determined to keep her 
past buried, but as the novel opens Luc is back -- and he is equally determined 
to dig it up. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight years and 14 romance novels, the best-selling Forster has branched 
out with a sexy commercial women's novel her publisher is billing as her 
"breakout" book. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say "Shameless" (Berkley; $4.99) doesn't have many of the 
elements of a category romance novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were to put it into a category I'd probably say it's romantic-suspense, 
but with a definite mainstream edge to it," says Forster, adding that 
"Shameless" is designed to appeal to both romance fans and a more general 
readership. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got plenty of romance, but it also has multiple characters and multiple 
viewpoints -- and the mystery subplot, which is what gives it a wider appeal. 
It's a book that's really about the emotional cost of keeping secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked as the No. 1 best-selling Bantam Loveswept author, Forster is 
best-known for being what one reviewer has described as "a stylist who 
translates sexual tension into sizzle and burn." In 1992, she received Romantic 
Times' Career Achievement Award in Sensuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to stress that that award is for my writing, not my personal life," 
jokes Forster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shameless," needless to say, carries on Forster's signature sensuality: 
steamy sex scenes, which she admits to enjoy writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was once quoted as saying the love scenes are exhausting, " Forster says 
with a laugh, "and there is some truth to that. It's really true that when 
you're writing them you're experiencing them to the extent that any writer 
experiences a scene that they're writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Forster may be branching out as a novelist, but one things remains constant: 
She still writes propped up with pillows on her bed, with her computer terminal 
at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an old habit, begun when she started writing fiction while recovering 
from a car accident in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was physically unable to sit up at a desk, so that's the way I did it," she 
recalls. "It seems there are various tricks writers use to get the imagination 
revved up. I've attempted several times to sit at a desk and write, but it 
never seems to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Forster is currently bedded down working on a new book, "a second big 
contemporary novel. I'd call this a romantic thriller, but it's very driven by 
the suspense plot." 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, doesn't mean she's finished writing category romances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really love that form, and I wouldn't mind at all going back to write more 
categories, but it's a question of time," she says. "I think career-wise it 
makes more sense to me to devote my time to the bigger books."

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; LAYING DOWN THE LAW; MOCK TRIAL PROGRAMS ALLOW 
STUDENTS TO GET TRAINING IN A COURTROOM SETTING AS THEY PRESENT A CRIMINAL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH WYDRA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Good evening, your honor, my name is Elizabeth Wydra, counsel for the 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually it takes years of schooling to be able to say those words in front of 
a judge. But thanks to the Mock Trial program at many Orange County high 
schools, students get a chance to present a criminal case before even 
graduating from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rosary High in Fullerton, where I am a senior, the mock trial team is 
composed of 25 juniors and seniors who take on the roles of attorneys, 
witnesses, understudies, bailiff and clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of law school, our training was an intense month of instruction in 
objections, question-writing and speeches, constitutional precedents for the 
pretrial motion, the subtleties of presenting a case in court, as well as 
constructing a case from the point of view of the prosecution and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Our teacher sponsor, Sharon Mulherin, worked with us every day at lunch and at 
all of our after-school practices. And we were coached by attorneys Glenn 
Osajima, a criminal defense lawyer, and Jan Sturla, a deputy district attorney, 
both of whom volunteered their time. 
</P>
<P>
 This training is typical of most hard-working mock trial teams.  
</P>
<P>
 However, at Rosary, there is something unique about our team: We are all young 
women. We are accustomed to the stigma that can be attached to coming from an 
all-girls school. And at mock trial competitions, we have often faced some 
ignorant assumptions about how good a team from a "girls school" could really 
be.  
</P>
<P>
 My teammates and I, however, are more than happy to demonstrate the error of 
that way of thinking. Last year, our team was one of the top four schools in 
Orange County. And this year, we won the county championship. (Rosary, which 
beat the team from El Dorado High School at the finals in December, will now go 
on to represent the county in state competition.)  
</P>
<P>
 The mock trial program, sponsored by the Constitutional Rights Foundation of 
Orange County, helps participants develop a multitude of skills applicable to 
the courtroom as well as other careers and aspects of life. 
</P>
<P>
 For students who are planning to pursue a law career, the mock trial program 
is invaluable. First, I found out whether I even liked being an attorney. Last 
year, when my objection as a defense attorney was sustained, I knew I was 
hooked. And it is exciting to see my generation's excitement about the legal 
system.  
</P>
<P>
 Through the program, I have learned to think on my feet and improvise. I have 
learned how to speak persuasively, even when the facts don't. And I have 
learned the importance of teamwork -- that people depend on me, whether it be 
my teammates or the person I am trying to defend. 
</P>
<P>
 I look back on all that I have learned, but most of all how much I've enjoyed 
this program. It has taught me the fundamentals of real life, and when I get 
out of law school and into the courtroom, it won't be for the first time. 
Behind the Mock Trial Program 
</P>
<P>
 The mock trial program for Orange County high school students is sponsored by 
the Constitutional Rights Foundation of Orange County, a nonprofit organization 
established in 1981 to provide educational programs for youth. Since then, more 
than 25,000 Orange County teens have participated in the group's programs, 
including a law day, business issues conference and the mock trial competition. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 50 high schools participated in the 1993 mock trial competition, 
involving about 1,200 students. The 10-week competition began in fall and ended 
with the finals in December at the Santa Ana courthouse. The state competition 
will be held April 8-10 in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the past four years a team from Orange County has won the state 
competition. Each year, attorneys in Orange County donate more than $3 million 
worth of billable hours to the competition, assisting as coaches and helping to 
plan the competition. And the Winners Are . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fifty Orange County high school teams participated in the 1993 mock trial 
competition sponsored by the Constitutional Rights Foundation of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Top 10 schools in this year's competition were: 
</P>

 While grunge fashion has caught on in Orange County, Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and other metro areas, the trend has skipped rural communities such 
as Lake Fallon and Hawthorn, Nev., reports Teen Underground, a newspaper for 
teens in Nevada.Down on the Range Wranglers still rule supreme, reports the 
paper.  
</P>
<P>
 Teens in Fallon say there is less fashion diversity at the local high school 
than in the fashion capitals, in part because there are fewer places to shop. 
"People in Fallon don't know what grunge is," said one teen. "If they do, they 
are considered weird. People here don't spend a lot of money on clothes."

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; MY TURN; ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO ADVERTISEMENTS ARE 
BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLES OF HYPOCRISY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By June Chang, June Chang, 16, is a junior at Huntington Beach High School. 
This article first appeared in the student newspaper, the Oiler.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On flashes a commercial, with beautiful young men and women having the time of 
their lives at a poolside party, each holding a can of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day in the media we are shown situations promoting the use of legal 
drugs, whether it's alcohol or tobacco. This glamorization of drugs is 
everywhere: on billboards, in magazines, on TV, on radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The media are extremely powerful influences in our society, and we must stop 
their support of drug use if we ever hope to win the war on drugs. People get 
the message that using drugs can change their image by making them more 
attractive or popular. In women's fashion magazines, there are Virginia Slims 
and Capri advertisements with beautiful models elegantly holding cigarettes.  
</P>
<P>
 This widespread promotion of tobacco becomes even more ridiculous in ads that 
actually portray athletic smokers! One cigarette ad shows a group of men 
white-water rafting. The ad is extremely hypocritical: Smoking actually 
inhibits athletic activity by damaging the lungs, and leading to diseases such 
as lung cancer and emphysema.  
</P>
<P>
 The "Alive With Pleasure!" slogan by cigarette manufacturer Newport tops them 
all. It flies in the face of the well-documented facts about the hazards of 
smoking and how it shortens lives. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as if nothing else in the world matters if you have your favorite beer, a 
commercial on TV shows a man stranded on a desert island who is unconcerned 
because he has his Keystone Light. 
</P>
<P>
 These ad writers are experts at their art. They know exactly what to do to 
make us remember their product. How many times have you caught yourself 
unconsciously singing that familiar "Nothing Beats a Bud" jingle? 
</P>
<P>
 What's even worse about all this advertising of legal drugs is that a lot of 
it is targeted toward children and young adults. The ads for Camel cigarettes 
have used an animated character, Joe Camel, that appeals to young children. 
Even in the popular TV show "Beverly Hills 90210," one of the main characters, 
Brenda, smokes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is still hope to end this blatant support of drug use. Many 
commercials now promote a drug-free America by urging parents to talk to their 
kids about drugs.  
</P>
<P>
 TV shows such as "Family Matters" and "Roseanne" address the importance of 
staying off drugs. Cigarette commercials have already been banned from 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 It may take a lot of time and hard work, but if we are truly willing to 
abolish the media's support of drug abuse, it can be done.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; HOLIDAYS MAGNIFY PAIN OF LOSING BELOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COREY T. GRIFFIN, Corey T. Griffin is a student at Troy High School in 
Fullerton. This article first appeared in the student newspaper, the Oracle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the holidays, there is a tradition in many homes of children gathering 
around the dinner table to watch their fathers carve the turkey that is the 
centerpiece of the family meal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Troy High School sophomore Brooke (who wishes to remain anonymous) has not 
been a part of this festive scene since her father died three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Just five days after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Coping with the death of a parent or a loved one can be a formidable and 
trying task, especially during the holidays when the affirmation of 
relationships and celebration are at a high, according to clinical psychologist 
Ronald Jue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the memories of a deceased loved one are associated with a great deal of 
warmth and joy, the memories come on stronger during the holidays," Jue said. 
"That's why many people get despondent during the holiday season because they 
feel the accumulative effects of the family member not being there year after 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 While Brooke watches her older brother set up the Christmas tree, she cannot 
help but think of the last Christmas she watched her father perform the same 
task -- just three years before. 
</P>
<P>
 "The memories of my father really come on strong this time of year because 
Christmas is a family holiday. There is a big sense of loss every year," Brooke 
said. "I miss my dad the most during Christmas mornings because my dad was the 
designated Santa Claus. He would sit underneath the tree and hand out the 
presents to us one by one. Now my mom or one of us plays Santa, but it's just 
not the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Memories of her father do not plague Brooke just around Christmas; they are a 
daily occurrence. Jue attributes the frequency of such memories as a means of 
compensation for the lack of a parent's presence in a child's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family would sit around the table and plan what we were going to do that 
day, while my dad was at the stove cooking eggs and frying bacon. He always 
made breakfast in his robe that was a light brown, almost beige, with big navy 
blue stripes on his sleeves and near his elbows," Brooke said. "That was my 
father's place during my family's Saturday morning ritual. Now when I eat eggs 
or bacon, it reminds me of my father." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jue, the most painful memories occur when children have not 
expressed their feelings to their parents before they died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once my father told me to come over to him, and he gave me a hug. I hugged 
him back," Brooke said. "I felt like saying, 'I love you,' but my father was 
not a very affectionate person. I thought I didn't have to tell him then 
because I thought I had all the time in the world. That's the memory I regret 
the most, because I didn't take the opportunity to tell him that I love him 
when it was right under my nose." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke has not had to deal with the grief alone. She said therapy allowed her 
to release her emotions and helped her see there were many things left in her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to work through the grief some way so you can move on with your 
life," Jue said. "Therapy really focuses on helping the child to integrate 
their experiences with death in such a way that they can positively move on in 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Through therapy, Brooke has come to realize the importance of seizing every 
opportunity to let a loved one know exactly how she feels. 
</P>
<P>
 And she realizes the loss of her father is something she will feel throughout 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember I was at my eighth-grade graduation dance and I had been having 
fun with my friends all night long," Brooke said. "All of a sudden, during the 
last dance, the deejay said, 'OK girls, dance with your dads,' and the boys had 
to dance with their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked around and saw all of my friends with their fathers, and it just hit 
me all of a sudden. My father is not here. He'll never be here. He won't be 
able to give me away at my wedding, and he won't see me graduate from college.

CHILD STARS SHINE FOR COLLECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Friends told Ray Court of Florida no one would come to a movie-actors 
memorabilia show in Hollywood. They said no one would come to see former child 
stars and Western heroes in a town where celebrities can be seen everywhere 
from local fund-raisers to the corner market. 
</P>
<P>
 They were wrong. Court, promoter of the Hollywood Collector's Show, says not 
only do show-goers love having an opportunity to shake hands and chat with 
stars of TV shows and films they grew up with, but dozens of celebrities have 
been hooked too. And many of them set up their own tables with photographs, 
books and memorabilia from their movies and television shows. Three members of 
the "Dennis the Menace" show will attend the shows scheduled Saturday and 
Sunday at the Beverly Garland Hotel, 4222 Vineland Ave., North Hollywood. They 
are Jay North (Dennis), Gloria (Dennis' mom, Mrs. Mitchell) and Jeannie Russell 
(prissy neighbor Margaret). 
</P>
<P>
 Other child stars who will bring their own merchandise are Paul Petersen ("The 
Donna Reed Show") and Brandon Cruz ("The Courtship of Eddie's Father") and Lisa 
Loring ("The Addams Family"). Among the heroes of the 1940s-'60s are cowboys 
Montie Montana, George Montgomery and Monte Hale, Gordon Scott of "Tarzan," 
Phyllis Coates of TV's "Superman," Hal Smith of "The Andy Griffith Show," and 
Eddie (Kookie) Byrnes of "77 Sunset Strip." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 dealers will also participate in the show, held four times a 
year. Show hours are Saturday 10 a.m.-7 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m.-5 p.m. 
Admission is $5, children free with an adult. (800) 238-3759. LAURIE K.

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: THERE'S A DOWNSIDE TO CELEBRITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM

<TEXT>
<P>
 The music has stopped at the Celebrity Theatre. Actions in a pending 
bankruptcy case could determine when it can play again and who will be 
presenting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to hold on to the theater is Edward J. Haddad, whose company, 
California Celebrity Theatre Inc., has leased the building since June 1987 from 
its owner, the Leo Freedman Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddad's company filed for Chapter 11 protection Dec. 16 in U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court in Santa Ana. Court documents reveal that Haddad is at odds with both 
Avalon Attractions, the Encino-based concert company that he hired to run the 
Celebrity, and the Freedman Foundation. Haddad and the foundation have been 
engaged in a lawsuit over whether California Celebrity has met its rent 
obligations and is entitled to retain its lease on the 2,800-capacity 
theater-in-the-round. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a document in the bankruptcy file, Haddad's company (he is the 
president and sole shareholder of California Celebrity) earned $550,000 from 
theater operations in 1991 and $440,000 in 1992. But its 1993 income was zero, 
because, according to one of Haddad's filings in the case, "Avalon Attractions 
has not remitted funds." 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan is to get Avalon out of there," said Albert M. Sheppard, Haddad's 
bankruptcy attorney. Sheppard said he could not answer other questions 
pertaining to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddad could not be reached for comment. Contacted at the theater recently, 
Haddad's brother, Alex, said "everything's on the go, moving forward. . . . 
We've got to start booking and stuff." But he said only Edward Haddad could 
answer questions concerning the Celebrity's financial situation and its plans 
for resuming concert bookings. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent show at the Celebrity was on New Year's Eve, with comedian 
Howie Mandel. No shows have been booked for 1994. A recorded message on the 
theater's business lines advises that "upcoming events will be announced 
shortly, so keep checking with us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Brogna, vice president of venue operations for Avalon Attractions, said 
the company is unwilling to book more shows at the Celebrity while Haddad's 
bankruptcy petition goes forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Brogna said that since March, 1993, Avalon has been under contract to manage 
the Celebrity for Haddad. Brogna acknowledged that Avalon did not turn over any 
theater revenues to Haddad's company in 1993. The reason, he said, was that 
Haddad owed the money to Avalon for "operational fees and management fees" 
dating back at least to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Brogna said representatives of Haddad locked Avalon out of the Celebrity just 
before the Mandel show on New Year's Eve. "I couldn't address his motives," 
Brogna said. "He has taken it upon himself to change the locks. My information 
is he's in the building, attempting to operate." 
</P>
<P>
 Avalon would like to resume promoting at the Celebrity when the theater's 
financial situation becomes stable again, Brogna said. "We love the building, 
we support the building, and I think it's a very important building for the 
Orange County marketplace. I hope the Celebrity Theatre doesn't remain dark for 
a long time. That all depends on the courts and (the Freedman Foundation)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Celebrity's attractions have been wide-ranging, from country singers such 
as Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson to rapper L.L. Cool J to such R&B acts as 
Luther Vandross and the O'Jays, to folkie Gordon Lightfoot and the rock band 
Squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis Stern, co-trustee for the Freedman Foundation, a nonprofit philanthropy 
that supports the arts, said that California Celebrity Theatre Inc. is three 
months behind on its rent and that "it's really up to the bankruptcy court" 
whether Haddad's company will be able to keep its hold on the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is he has a certain amount of time where he will either 
affirm the lease and make payments, or reject the lease and be out," said 
Stern, a Los Angeles attorney. "I think he has to do that within 60 days. It's 
a fairly short fuse." 
</P>
<P>
 If Haddad loses the lease, Stern added, "we would certainly look for other 
tenants to run the building. The Freedman Foundation is not in the business of 
running a theater. It's not in our charitable charter, nor do we have the 
expertise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California Celebrity's bankruptcy petition lists $196,713 in debts. They 
include $22,000 in federal and state taxes, $52,000 owed to the landlord, 
smaller amounts owed to several radio stations and $54,100 owed to music 
publishers from a March, 1993, judgment in a federal lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, 10 song publishers successfully sued the Celebrity for allowing 
their songs to be performed at the theater during 1991 at a time when the 
Celebrity was not paying license fees to the performance rights clearinghouse, 
ASCAP. ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) charges 
venues that present live or recorded music a license fee, from which 
performance royalties owed to song publishers are paid. Haddad said in court 
documents that managers running daily operations at the theater had allowed the 
license fees to go unpaid and that he was never informed that the Celebrity's 
ASCAP license had lapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 In his bankruptcy petition, Haddad lists theater assets of $691,000. 
Equipment, supplies and furnishings account for about $96,000; the Celebrity's 
liquor license is valued at an additional $40,000. Haddad's assets list also 
includes an "unknown" amount owed to California Celebrity by Avalon 
Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the corporate worth -- $400,000 -- involves uncollected 
payments from a 1991 judgment in a breach-of-contract suit that Haddad won by 
default against a former partner in the theater, whom Haddad alleged had 
mismanaged the business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a pending lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court, Freedman Forum, the 
theater-holding entity of the Freedman Foundation, contends that the Celebrity 
underreported its income in 1987-88 by about $600,000 and that a percentage of 
that amount, totaling about $48,500, should have been paid as additional rent. 
According to the suit, the Celebrity reported $2.75 million in revenues from 
December, 1987, through November, 1988. The Freedman Forum claims that an audit 
it commissioned showed revenues of $3.34 million for that period. In court 
papers, Haddad has denied the alleged discrepancy.

FRANKLY, MY DEAR, IT'S ALL GONE; MOST OF MGM'S FABLED HERITAGE HAS BEEN SOLD 
OFF OR CAN'T BE FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is an irony not lost on employees at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Las Vegas last month, Kirk Kerkorian opened the MGM Grand, a $1-billion, 
lion-headed resort hotel featuring fantasy casino settings like "The Wizard of 
Oz" and a 33-acre theme park with attractions that sound like names from a 
Hollywood back lot: Casablanca Plaza, New York Street, French Street, Salem 
Waterfront, Olde England Street, Rio Grande Cantina. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme park even sells studio souvenirs and has a back-lot river tour along 
a simulated movie set. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are those who believe that the old MGM itself -- arguably the 
grandest of all studios -- once could have been developed into one of Southern 
California's biggest tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 With three huge lots in Culver City -- all interconnected by trams -- an MGM 
studio theme park, some believe, could have easily overshadowed the Universal 
Studios Tour. In fact, such a plan was once presented to management, former 
officials say, but it was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony of it is, Mr. Kerkorian has spent $1 billion building a hotel and 
ersatz theme park using some MGM images," said George Feltenstein, senior vice 
president and general manager for MGM/United Artists Home Video Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine what an MGM theme park would have been?" Feltenstein added. 
"To see 'Mutiny on the Bounty,' 'Show Boat,' the Tarzan lake, the David 
Copperfield street for England, the New York street where a million movies were 
made, the Waterloo Bridge set. There was a full circus set. A studio zoo. This 
was the greatest studio in Hollywood, far and above all the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened in the intervening years," he added, "no one would have 
believed it 50 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, what remains of the fabled studio is in an office park in Santa Monica. 
The complex has executive balconies, richly paneled screening rooms, tennis 
courts and even a lap pool for employees. Large murals depicting scenes from 
famous MGM movies decorate the walls of the underground garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerkorian is gone. So is Giancarlo Parretti, the mysterious Italian financier 
who took control of the studio in 1990 with $1.3 billion in backing from Credit 
Lyonnais, the French bank. When Parretti failed to repay his debt, the bank 
seized the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 To run MGM and its newly revived United Artists unit, Credit Lyonnais has 
hired former Paramount Pictures chief Frank G. Mancuso, who has plans to 
eventually boost distribution to 25 pictures a year so the studio can attract a 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later this year, MGM plans to release "That's Entertainment, Part 3," a sequel 
to the 1974 and 1976 films that paid tribute to the studio's famous musicals. 
To assemble the newest version, producers scoured film archives, finding 
never-before-seen outtakes from "Singin' in the Rain," "The Harvey Girls" and 
"Easter Parade," just to name a few. They also found outtakes of Ava Gardner 
singing in her own voice to Clark Gable in the 1951 Western "Lone Star." Her 
voice was dubbed when the film was released theatrically. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's terrific," Feltenstein said of Gardner's singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Feltenstein said the studio also has recently conducted a "corporate 
archeological expedition" at a Kansas salt mine, looking for stills, publicity 
materials and other corporate records stored underground after MGM purchased 
United Artists in 1981 from Transamerica Corp. and formed MGM/UA Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found a lot of the original proofs of stills, (including) over 1,200 
pictures for 'New York, New York,' " he said. "We are creating a definitive 
laser-disc version now." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite such finds, so much of MGM's legacy is now either in other hands 
or simply gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the outtakes and screen tests were ordered destroyed," recalled 
one studio source. "There was a corporate decision made at the time to get rid 
of the 'old.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, stories have often circulated that what Kerkorian didn't 
bulldoze or auction off in the 1970s was simply tossed into Santa Monica Bay or 
buried under a freeway in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Roger Mayer, who ran the MGM lot for 25 years until 1986, said such 
stories simply aren't true. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inaccurate to say a lot of stuff was thrown away," said Mayer, who is 
now president of Turner Entertainment Co., which owns MGM's pre-1986 films. 
</P>
<P>
 To find MGM's heritage, he said, one simply must know where to look. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, Ted Turner purchased pre-1986 films from MGM's vast library for 
his cable TV empire. The movies -- along with everything Warner Bros. released 
prior to 1950 and RKO released between 1930 and 1957 -- are now stored at 
various sites around the country, including a 600-foot-deep salt mine in 
Hutchinson, Kan., (accessed with oxygen masks and hard hats), Wright-Patterson 
Air Force Base in Ohio and a high-tech warehouse in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The original Technicolor negatives of "Gone With the Wind," "The Wizard of 
Oz," "Show Boat," "Singin' in the Rain" and "Meet Me in St. Louis" are among 
hundreds of MGM movies stored at the George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Jan-Christopher Horak, senior curator of the film collection at the 
photography museum, said that saving those rare negatives was a close call. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were going to dump them in the ocean," Horak said. "They thought what 
they had was protected. They didn't think they'd have to go back to the 
originals." 
</P>
<P>
 What Turner found when it bought the MGM films, Horak said, was that some of 
the color movies had faded. "Thank goodness the original nitrate negatives 
survived," Horak said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studios have changed their ways now," Horak added, "but up until about 1980 
and the advent of videotapes, there wasn't a whole lot of need to keep old 
material. It was not an asset, it was a liability, because it cost money to 
store it. . . . Universal (Pictures) used to burn its vaults periodically." 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous outtakes and screen tests also are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the screen tests were destroyed is we were not (legally) allowed 
to use them again," Mayer explained. "Screen Actors Guild rules and contracts 
provided that you couldn't show them commercially. . . . If you can't use them, 
why hang onto them anymore?" 
</P>
<P>
 One major exception, he noted, was "Gone With the Wind." Vivien Leigh's screen 
test survived because the family of producer David O. Selznick gave them to the 
University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer said MGM was once actually made up of six lots, but there were three key 
ones in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Lot 1, Mayer said, the current site of Sony Pictures Entertainment, featured a 
lake used in Tarzan movies and the paddlewheeler in "Show Boat." Lot 2, located 
at the corner of Culver and Overland, included the Andy Hardy street, an 
international street where Gene Kelly danced in "Singin' in the Rain" and the 
rustic train station seen in the Civil War drama "Raintree County," starring 
Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. Lot 3, at Overland and Jefferson, had 
Western streets that were used for, among other things, the filming of "How the 
West Was Won."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bulldozers did what Gen. Sherman and the Yankees didn't do to Twelve Oaks, one 
of the Southern mansions in "Gone With the Wind." The HMS Bounty, built for the 
first filming of "Mutiny on the Bounty" starring Charles Laughton and Clark 
Gable, was smashed to smithereens to make way for residential developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer concedes that MGM executives once had a chance to create a magnificent 
theme park with the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "That decision was made with the full knowledge of the fact that it could have 
turned into a Universal Studios-type tour with plans for such a tour available 
to that management," Mayer said. "Yet, that management felt that No. 1, it 
wasn't too good an idea; No. 2, they wanted cash for other purposes and, No. 3, 
(the back lots) were not really being used because everybody was going on 
location in those days." 
</P>
<P>
 As for MGM's scripts, Turner recently donated some 50,000 items to the Academy 
of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' Margaret Herick Library. Among the 
authors and playwrights whose works are included are F. Scott Fitzgerald, John 
O'Hara, Dorothy Parker, Ben Hecht, Dalton Trumbo and Paddy Chayefsky. 
</P>
<P>
 But controversy still swirls around the loss of orchestral arrangements from 
the studio's music library. "The only thing I distinctly remember that was 
thrown away were parts and pieces of music scores," Mayer said. "Not the 
overall scores that the conductor conducted with an orchestra, but parts and 
pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 One studio source, however, said the missing scores -- which numbered upward 
of 150,000 pages -- were likely "wrapped in plastic bags and used as landfill 
in Ventura County."

'THE CISCO KID' WALKS BETWEEN TWO WORLDS; TELEVISION: FILMMAKERS GET BACK TO 
THEIR ROOTS IN THE TNT MOVIE, FOLLOWING THE FOOTSTEPS OF A LEGENDARY HERO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The rebellious black stallion had finally let Jimmy Smits mount him and the 
six child actors playing Cheech Marin's brood were primed to pay their father a 
tearful goodby when the first raindrops fell. 
</P>
<P>
 A clap of thunder sent the cast and crew of Turner Network Television's 
made-for-TV movie "The Cisco Kid" running for the cover of an adobe house in 
this mountain village, their sixth location in as many weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way it's been, always trying to beat something -- the rain or the 
dark," said Marin, who plays sidekick Pancho to Smits' Cisco. He laughed and 
added: "We ride for hours. Every day I wake up with new bruises. Had I known, I 
would have asked for more money." 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a month of 20-hour days, hailstorms and saddle sores, the 
"Cisco Kid" stars were getting punchy. But just past the jokes was a sense of 
purpose -- Chicano filmmakers who have come to Mexico to work with colleagues 
here in revising the legend of a 19th-Century Californio's role in helping 
Mexico regain its independence during the French occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 The $6-million project, which premieres on TNT Feb. 6, brought together: 
Smits, "L.A. Law's" brooding, idealistic Victor Sifuentes; Marin of the Cheech 
& Chong comedy team and, more recently, "Born in East L.A.," the 
tongue-in-cheek saga of a Chicano's sojourn in Mexico; Luis Valdez, who 
directed "La Bamba" and "Zoot Suit"; and Moctesuma Esparza, who along with 
partner Robert Katz produced "Gettysburg," "The Milagro Beanfield War" and "The 
Ballad of Gregorio Cortez." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans with extensive international credits, such as cinematographer 
Guillermo Navarro, handled much of the film's technical side and supporting 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a collaboration of Chicano and Mexican filmmakers to portray both our 
history," Esparza said. 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude permeated the set, where about the only English spoken was the 
actors' lines and a few phrases of show-business jargon that crossed the border 
along with the first Hollywood movie-makers to film in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez brought his wife and teen-age sons along for the entire filming and 
encouraged other members of the cast and crew to invite their families to the 
set. Villagers who wanted to watch the filming were welcomed and often offered 
small roles, giving the production the atmosphere of a family outing. 
</P>
<P>
 A new purpose is also evident in the movie's story line. In this version, the 
character based on an O. Henry story, "The Caballero's Way," remains the Wild 
West adventurer brought to the screen by actors Stan Dunn, Warner Baxter, Cesar 
Romero and Duncan Renaldo. But this Cisco has the added dimension of a man in 
search of himself. He was born in California when it was still part of Mexico 
but made a fortune as a '49er in the Gold Rush and fought in the Civil War as 
an American. He travels to Mexico on a secret mission from the U.S. government 
to supply guns to Mexican rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cisco is probably the first Chicano," said Smits, a New Yorker of Puerto 
Rican descent. "There is a whole question of identity, 'Where do I belong?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That question was reflected in the costuming that production designer Joe 
Aubel developed for Smits. In early scenes, he wears high boots and a leather 
belt typical of a Civil War veteran, along with striped trousers used on the 
border during that era. As Cisco travels farther into Mexico, he dons the black 
charro , or Mexican cowboy costume that identifies the Cisco Kid character the 
way the Lone Ranger is known by his mask. 
</P>
<P>
 "The costume evolves as he finds himself," Aubel explained. Cisco's clothes 
become part of exploring his Mexican side, as does his friendship with Pancho. 
"Pancho fulfills a part of him that he is trying to tap into," Smits said. 
</P>
<P>
 That portrayal of Pancho -- radically different from the slovenly buffoon 
shown in earlier productions of "The Cisco Kid" -- attracted Marin to the 
script that Michael Kane co-wrote with director Valdez. "What has really 
shifted is who Pancho is in relation to Cisco," Marin said. "He is the 
revolutionary, the idealist." 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes being filmed on one recent day were crucial to establishing the 
relationship between gun-runner Cisco and freedom fighter Pancho -- compatriots 
separated by a border. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubel covered a tin roof with red tiles to transform the Telesforo Sanchez 
family home into the house where an 1860s Pancho lived with his wife, Rosa 
(Yareli Arizmendi, who played the eldest daughter in "Like Water for 
Chocolate"), and their six children. Over a tequila breakfast, Pancho and Rosa 
try to persuade Cisco to join the insurgency against the French occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a lucky man, Pancho," Smits tells Marin. "You have a home, a good 
wife, children -- lots of them -- and a country to fight for." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's your country too, isn't it?" Arizmendi asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be," Smits replies. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Valdez said, "We used the French intervention to give Pancho a 
background, a political context."  
</P>
<P>
 It was also a chance to inform viewers, Esparza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Americans don't know that the French invaded Mexico and attempted to 
establish a monarchy," he said. A Mexican victory against enormous odds in an 
1862 battle of the insurgency against the French occupation is the fete that is 
celebrated every May 5 as Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-minute downpour that the cast and crew experienced here was a mere 
inconvenience compared to other weather problems the movie suffered. A week 
earlier, the Mexican army was sent out to rescue the production troupe. A 
hailstorm had caught them on a desert mountaintop in the middle of a battle 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 50 horses freaking out," Marin recalled. "It was scary because all you 
can do is stand there and get rained on." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the impromptu rescue, Mexican soldiers played a crucial planned role 
in "The Cisco Kid." Both the French and insurgent troops seen in the movie are 
really Mexican cavalry, with a few cowboys thrown in to increase the numbers. 
"Where else are you going to find people who can ride in formation?" asked 
Esparza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government also cooperated in easing the way for gun and gunpowder 
permits, difficult to obtain here. 
</P>
<P>
 The production roamed throughout the country, from the colonial city of 
Zacatecas to the desert village of Sombrerete to the organ pipe cactus region 
known as Los Organos. 
</P>
<P>
 "These images are not going to be the images American audiences have typically 
seen of Mexico," Esparza said. "We are going to show lush, green countryside. . 
. . We are trying to create a three-dimensional aspect of history while we 
entertain." 
</P>
<P>
 That historical aspect was brought home to Valdez during one location shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Sombrerete, we were shooting across the street from a house with a plaque 
that said 'Benito Juarez slept here,' " he recalled. His voice was tinged with 
the awe he still felt at having retraced the steps of the hero who freed Mexico 
from the French occupation and introduced reforms, such as the separation of 
church and state, that are central to government in Mexico today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have thoroughly enjoyed interacting with Mexican crews," the director said. 
"This has been a watershed year." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a watershed, in fact, that Valdez even shaved the mustache he has worn 
for 35 years in order to play a cameo role of Juarez. "He is one of the great 
democratic heroes of the Americas," Valdez explained. "I have identified with 
him since I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the lost mustache, Valdez said: "At 18, I started to grow a mustache to 
emphasize my Mexican heritage. . . . It has become part of my permanent image. 
But now, I no longer need a mustache to affirm my Mexican heritage."

TIME TO ERASE TAPE FORMAT FROM POP REPERTORY?; MUSIC INDUSTRY: TOWER RECORDS 
BEGINS PHASING OUT CASSETTES BY CUTTING INVENTORY AND REDUCING ORDERS IN ITS 87 
STORES. OTHER RETAILERS DISPUTE IDEA THAT THE POPULAR FORMAT IS BECOMING 
OBSOLETE.

<P>
 Just five years after American pop fans said goodby to vinyl albums, one of 
the nation's showcase retailers says it is time to pull the plug on another 
contemporary pop trademark: cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic move, Tower Records, the first chain to usher in compact discs, 
has already begun slowly phasing out the tape format by cutting cassette 
inventory and reducing orders in its 87 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cassette is on the verge of extinction," said Stan Goman, senior vice 
president of the Sacramento-based Tower chain, which expects to be completely 
out of the cassette business within two years. "I may be a bit myopic, but the 
way I see it, prerecorded tapes are fast approaching the fate of vinyl." 
</P>
<P>
 Other retailers, however, expressed surprise this week at Tower's decision -- 
and disputed the idea that cassettes are obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider the cassette tape to be an extremely viable product and 
anticipate it to be around for at least another five years," said Arnie 
Bernstein, president of the music division of Musicland, the nation's largest 
record retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tapes don't have the same problems as LPs when competing with compact discs. 
Cassettes offer consumers an economically priced portable medium unlike any 
other on the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Murray, vice president and general manager of the music division of the 
Ft. Lauderdale-based, 520-outlet Blockbuster chain, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no intention of quitting the cassette business and would be more than 
happy to accommodate any customer Tower turns away." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry debate over the future of cassettes intensified in recent weeks as 
1993 figures showed that cassette sales accounted for less than 46% of the 
recording industry's $9-billion business, down from 61% five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's figure was an all-time cassette low since the tapes became popular 
in the late '70s -- down 8% from 1992, according to SoundScan, the research 
firm that tabulates computerized data for the music business. However, figures 
show, tape remains the configuration of choice for more than half of the 
nation's rap and country fans and continues to dominate sales in mass merchant 
stores such as K mart and Target. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower's retreat from cassettes -- which represented only 20% of the chain's 
'93 sales total -- is based on the stores' unique position in the retail 
market, says Goman. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm derives more revenue from catalogue sales than its competitors and 
specializes in classical music -- a genre in which all but the Top 50 selling 
albums is no longer available on cassette. 
</P>
<P>
 Goman says as tapes continue to lose ground to the compact disc, record 
companies will stop manufacturing cassette versions of catalogue albums in pop, 
rock and other genres. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other industry analysts attribute the shift in consumer allegiance to 
the better sound, greater durability and ease of programming of CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 The vinyl album disappeared, retailers say, because it could not compete with 
the superior home audio experience delivered by the compact disc. Indeed, more 
than 42% of American households have switched from the turntable to the CD 
player since the CD's advent in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 But most consumers who purchase albums on cassette listen to them in cars or 
on portable players -- not at home, recording industry surveys suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sales for CD car and portable players are on the rise, few industry 
analysts expect them to overtake rival cassette players before the turn of the 
century. So far, music fans have failed to respond to alternative high-tech 
formats such as Sony's mini disc machine and Philips' digital compact cassette 
(DCC) player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Portability and price are the two critical issues here," said Jay Berman, 
chief executive officer of the Recording Industry Assn. of America, the 
Washington trade organization whose member companies manufacture about 95% of 
the recordings sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have grown accustomed to the relatively inexpensive price of Walkmans 
and until something comes along to compete with that, I just don't see the 
cassette disappearing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Goman feels other factors will also work against the cassette in coming 
months, notably the recent threat of price-slashing from discount houses such 
as Best Buy and Circuit City, which sell Top 40 compact discs below cost for 
$10. Such competition is forcing record chains to reduce superstar CDs to 
$11.98 -- only $1 more than the suggested list price of top-line cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way the record companies can save the cassette is to drop the price, 
but what do you think the chances are that they're going to do that?" said 
Goman, who intends to eventually replace cassettes at Tower with book, video 
and CD-ROM products. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason that tape is still a factor in the U.S. is that the industry 
has yet to come up with an economically feasible way to make compact discs 
portable. Mark my words: When that day arrives, you can put a fork in it, 
mister, because it'll be done."

CLUB REVIEW; AT SWINGERS, THE JUKEBOX KEEPS THE JOINT JUMPIN'

 Swingers rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-month-old diner may lure people in with promises of veggie burgers, 
turbocharged Smart Drinks and weekday happy hours, but it's the music pumping 
from the jukebox that makes this place one of L.A.'s delights. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating the perfect jukebox selection is no easy task -- there's no 
accounting for taste, and the palate of this town changes faster than a mood 
ring -- but Swingers keeps it a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiched between Puccini and Chet Baker, you'll find selection from Isaac 
Hayes, Fugazi and the Vibrators. If you're looking for music styles to match 
the faux blue-collar look of the diner -- the uniformly good-looking servers 
are dressed in grease-monkey garb -- you can choose from a generous supply of 
Tom Waits and Patsy Cline.  
</P>
<P>
 A buck will get you three selections, two will score you seven, and if you 
want to dominate the room for the duration of your stay, drop a five-spot and 
own the jukebox for the next 18 songs.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Swingers is open Friday and Saturday nights till 4 a.m. (2 a.m. other 
nights) and offers 99-cent pints of Rolling Rock from 5 to 7 p.m. on weekdays, 
regulars know that the place really swings at breakfast. Opening time is 7 a.m. 
on weekdays and 8 a.m. on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 One complaint about an otherwise amazing array of music: This is one of the 
few places in town where there's been no Elvis sighting. Maybe next week.

'PREVAILING WAGE' LAW REFORM BLOCKED; POLITICS: TWO BILLS BY SEN. ROB HURTT TO 
SLASH WORKER PAY IN GOVERNMENT PROJECTS DIE. LEGISLATOR CITES SAVINGS BUT LABOR 
OFFICIALS WARN OF SLIPSHOD WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rejecting arguments it would save the state more than $300 million a year, a 
Senate committee on Wednesday scuttled an Orange County lawmaker's effort to 
slash wages paid for government projects such as roads and prison construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting along party lines, Democrats on the Senate Industrial Relations 
Committee killed two bills by Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) designed to 
reduce the "prevailing wage" paid for government-funded construction work. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt argued that the savings would prove vital as the budget-strapped state 
grapples with ways to finance more prison construction, amid expectations that 
toughened sentencing requirements will flood already crowded lockups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that the legislators, who support paying a flagman on a road 
job $42.73 an hour for working on a Sunday, claim in their next breath that we 
can't afford to keep dangerous felons in prison," Hurtt said in a statement 
after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills were buffeted by opposition from labor union representatives, who 
said Hurtt's proposals would crowd government projects with unskilled labor, 
driving up costs due to shoddy workmanship. In addition, local governments 
would be "digging their own grave" because reduced wages would mean less tax 
revenue for the public sector, said John F. Henning of the California Labor 
Federation, AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any attempts to dilute wages is against the interests of the workers," 
Henning said. "If we're going to get into the petty nonsense of counting 
nickels and dimes, we ought to take a look at the exorbitant salaries being 
paid these city managers and local government executives." 
</P>
<P>
 With the defeat of the legislation, Hurtt said he plans to ask Gov. Pete 
Wilson to take administrative steps to alter the prevailing wage law. Wilson 
Administration officials said they welcome the request, but expressed fears 
that any attempts to change wages could be slowed or stopped by lawsuits filed 
by organized labor. John Duncan, spokesman for the state Department of 
Industrial Relations, said prevailing wage is "a sacred issue" for labor 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan said the administration might attempt to ask for changes during 
upcoming budget negotiations, which would provide the "most effective forum" 
for give-and-take between lawmakers representing opposing views. In particular, 
he said, "perhaps there can be some give out of the Democratic side of the 
aisle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of Hurtt's bills would have scrapped California's existing method of 
calculating prevailing wages in favor of the system used by the federal 
government and all 49 other states. The change would have saved 20% in labor 
costs on public works projects, Hurtt said, money the state could use each year 
to build 75 additional schools or 20 jails with 100 beds each. 
</P>
<P>
 The other measure would have allowed local governments to exempt themselves 
from prevailing wage laws for municipal projects, an idea that has been 
supported by the League of California Cities and other government groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from implications for the state budget, the current prevailing wage 
formula is "bad civil rights," said state Sen. Tom Campbell (R-Stanford), a 
supporter of Hurtt's reform movement. Campbell said the system is based on the 
federal Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, which originally was intended to let labor 
unions dominated by whites avoid competing for scarce jobs with migrant black 
workers willing to take lower wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, reformers say, the expensive process of completing volumes of 
paperwork required under the measure effectively keeps minority and 
female-owned businesses from competing for and winning government construction 
projects. Carol Biondi, president of a small Bay Area construction firm, said 
the prevailing wage laws make competing for government jobs "a morass."

3 TO BE TRIED AS ADULTS IN WOODS SLAYING; COURTS: JUDGE CITES THE 'SENSELESS' 
NATURE OF OCT. 15 ATTACK ON YOUTH AT SAN CLEMENTE BEACH, ORDERS 17-YEAR-OLDS TO 
FACE ASSAULT, MURDER CHARGES. A FOURTH JUVENILE SUSPECT FACES A SIMILAR HEARING 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Juvenile Court judge on Wednesday ordered three juveniles to stand trial as 
adults for the slaying of 17-year-old Steve Woods, whose head was pierced with 
a paint roller rod at a San Clemente beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing before Judge Frank F. Fasel will continue today to determine 
whether a fourth juvenile should also be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the "totally senseless and gratuitous" nature of the Oct. 15 crime, as 
well as the appearance of gang activity, the judge ruled that Julio Perez 
Bonilla, Hector Penuelas and Rogelio Vasquez Solis, all 17 and from San 
Clemente, should face assault and murder charges as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants face stiffer sentences -- a potential minimum of 15 years in 
state prison -- if convicted as charged in adult court. Juveniles can be held 
only until age 25 at the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Family and friends of both the defendants and victim packed the emotionally 
charged courtroom, some in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's mother and sister, who wore a black T-shirt reading "Always in 
our heart Steve Wood," smiled and cheered noiselessly as the judge made his 
rulings. The family members said they were hoping for the stiffest penalties 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Revenge is not the answer," said Kathy Woods of San Clemente, the victim's 
mother. "But to save other human beings is the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The three defendants were sent to Orange County Jail on $250,000 bail and will 
appear for possible arraignment on Friday in Laguna Niguel Municipal Court. 
They face one charge of murder, 10 counts of assault and one felony count of 
throwing an object at a moving vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer said he also will allege that the three are 
members of a gang, which would increase their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was among 10 friends in several vehicles who were pelted with rocks, 
beer cans and other items by a group of 10 to 15 people as they tried to avoid 
a confrontation at Calafia County Beach Park in San Clemente, where they had 
gone after a football game, according to testimony and police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the breaking of windows, Woods, a passenger in the first vehicle to leave 
the parking lot, was somehow speared through the head with the metal rod of a 
paint roller. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who was in his senior year at San Clemente High School, fell into a 
coma after the attack and died Nov. 9, having never regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Paer has declined to say who investigators believe actually threw the paint 
roller that struck Woods. The paint rollers were reportedly in the pickup 
driven by one of the suspects whose father is a painter. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records and police reports, Solis told police he threw a 
rock at the first vehicle, Penuelas admitted to throwing a stick at it, and 
Bonilla said he threw a metal bar, one or two feet long, at the same car. 
Bonilla is further alleged to have punched a friend of Woods' before the fatal 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Paer disclosed Wednesday that the same group of defendants are suspected of 
trying to provoke a fight just an hour before the fatal attack at a beach off 
Linda Lane near San Clemente Pier. In that case, four people -- who said their 
potential assailants were armed with metal pipes -- were able to talk their way 
out of any trouble, Paer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Court-appointed lawyers for the defendants argued that trying the youths as 
adults would only be making a tragic situation worse. The defendants should 
have a chance to be rehabilitated in the juvenile system rather being sent to 
state prison if they are convicted, the lawyer's said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the outcome of the crime was tragic, defense attorney Dennis McNerney 
said, the actual throwing of items was a "spur of the moment act by a bunch of 
kids" and did not demonstrate hardened criminal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "If no one was hurt by this, it would have been just another Friday night," 
McNerney said. "It's a tragedy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers submitted letters and called witnesses, including teachers and a 
youth leader, to say the alleged acts by the three youths were "out of 
character." 
</P>
<P>
 One San Clemente High School tutor and translator called to testify described 
Bonilla as a "gentle giant" and Solis as a "natural comedian." The boys worked 
hard at school and never posed disciplinary problems, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The four juvenile defendants are among a group of six charged in the case. One 
adult, Juan Enriquez Alcocer, 20, of San Clemente, was ordered last month to 
stand trial on murder and assault charges, while a second adult, Arturo 
Villalobos, pleaded guilty Tuesday to voluntary manslaughter and gang 
involvement.

LIFESAVERS, PRICE-SAVERS; THE LIFEGUARDS IN BUDGET-CONSCIOUS SEAL BEACH PULL 
DOUBLE DUTY BY BUILDINGTHEIR OWN TOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The red shorts said "Seal Beach Lifeguards," but the carpenter's belt around 
lifeguard Mark Lees wasn't for flotation. In its pockets were nails and a 
hammer Lees used to build a new lifeguard tower Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With new, prefab towers costing almost $16,000 each, the lifeguards, who have 
a history of scrounging and cutting corners, are saving the cash-strapped city 
money by building two new towers for $12,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Sign of the low-budget Nineties? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," said Lifeguard Chief Dan Dorsey, echoing sentiments at other Orange 
County coastal cities. With only two full-time lifeguards year-round in Seal 
Beach, putting on a carpenter's belt and banging nails is an asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "At bigger lifeguard departments you can get into narrow specialization," 
Dorsey said. "Not here. You need auto mechanic skills, carpentry, lifesaving, 
policing skills -- the more the better." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's lifeguard budget has remained at $440,000 for two years, although 
one full-time position was lost more than a year ago. That funding pays for a 
junior lifeguard program and a summer staff of about 18 part-time lifeguards 
during busy summer months when crowds soar to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Huntington Beach hires 12 permanent lifeguards and staffs 110 
lifeguards during the summer. But that city's lifeguards protect a larger beach 
area and deal with crowds of more than 65,000 on peak days, said Huntington 
Beach Lifeguard Capt. Bill Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Richardson said Huntington Beach has bought 20 prefab 
lifeguard towers costing about $15,500 each. The towers are fiberglass and 
stainless steel and were constructed at Folsom Prison by inmates working for 
Prison Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 At Seal Beach, winter means smaller beach crowds -- though balmy weather on 
Wednesday attracted about 50 surfers and beach users -- and time for building 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to build two towers this winter," lifeguard Lt. Steve Cushman 
said, "and, although the salt air really eats up the wood and metal, they 
should last 15 to 18 years." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a guy in the (lifeguard) tower and although we're pounding nails, 
if we get the word that there's a safety situation, we drop our gear and hit 
it," said Cushman, who wore jeans over red swimming trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the city owns seven all-wood towers. Cushman said the city's Public 
Works Department builds each tower's heavy base, and then lifeguards use city 
funds to buy plywood, beams, plate glass, nails and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest is sweat labor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the first time Seal Beach lifeguards have cut economic corners. 
</P>
<P>
 When a fierce storm wiped out a section of the city's pier in 1982, including 
its lifeguard tower, Cushman led a lifeguard wrecking crew that salvaged old 
wood and nails. 
</P>
<P>
 They then took a grappling hook to the pier's aluminum railing, tore it out 
and installed it atop a new, three-story stucco tower built at the foot of the 
pier by the lifeguard-carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
 Cushman said it helps when part-time lifeguards have other skills such as 
carpentry. Some have been general contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got estimates on the (pier) railing and one contractor wanted $8,000," 
Cushman said. "I said, 'Hell, the whole building only cost us $25,000 to build. 
So we got the railing off the destroyed section of pier, got corners and it 
became our new railing on our new tower. It only cost $300 in materials." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking around at the city's lifeguard complex is like a page from Dorsey's 
and Cushman's construction manual. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 2,200-square-foot garage was built by them and staff lifeguards in 1985. 
In earlier years, Cushman used to put in clutches and overhaul the department's 
four-wheel-drive Jeeps before they switched to pickups. 
</P>
<P>
 To replace a public address system, the financially strapped city department 
didn't look in a catalogue and order a new one. Cushman, who lives near Los 
Alamitos Race Track, visited the track's maintenance yard to scrounge for any 
surplus materials he could use. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a 40-foot pole laying around and when I asked, they said, 'Go ahead 
and take it if you need it.' They also had large speakers that had hung on 
poles their announcer used when they called the horse races and they gave me 
those, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Cushman had the Public Works Department cut the pole, and installed it on the 
pier with the speakers. A city electrician helped wire the "new" public address 
system, and within days, instead of hearing "quarter horse Witch's Brew by a 
nose," lifeguards were ordering bicyclists to walk their bikes on the pier.

FILM, SPEECHES INAGURATE KING BIRTHDAY TRIBUTES 
</P>

<P>
 Anniversary tributes to the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. began in Orange 
County Wednesday with poetry readings, choir performances and speeches about 
the legacy of the slain civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
 At UC Irvine, a three-day tribute began with a showing of a segment of "Eyes 
on the Prize," a documentary series chronicling King's life and the civil 
rights movement. Associate producer Judy Richardson later addressed students 
and faculty members in a Wednesday evening symposium that also featured gospel 
singers and a mayoral proclamation from the city of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Parham, coordinator of UC Irvine's 10th annual observance of King's 
birthday, said the events are intended to serve both as a celebration of King's 
life and a reminder of the progress that has yet to be made toward his dream of 
an equal society. 
</P>
<P>
 Parham said the yearly tributes -- at churches, schools and other 
organizations throughout the county -- provide an opportunity to celebrate 
black culture and history, as well as a time to take pride in the gains blacks 
have made toward greater political representation in the years since King's 
assassination in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 But much work remains to be done, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While this county is a desegregated place, I don't think it's a very 
integrated place yet," said Parham, the director of UCI's counseling center and 
career planning and placement center. "To be truly integrated, everybody who 
represents a different culture has to be able to see himself reflected in the 
larger community and its institutions. African Americans can't do that here 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the events scheduled on the campus during the next few days include 
panel discussions, community forums and a traditional march from Mason Park to 
Gateway Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the county, these organizations are planning activities in honor of 
King's birthday during the next week: 
</P>
<P>
 * Today, the Baptist Ministers Fellowship Conference of Orange County will 
host the first of three services, "In the Spirit of Unity," with host Pastor 
Van Roberson at Greater Light Baptist Church. Pastor George W. Banks will 
speak. The service is at 7 p.m. at 1600 W. 3rd St., Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 * A student panel on "Moving From Desegregation to Integration: An Open Forum 
on Race Relations," will be held at 10 a.m. today in Emerald Bay Rooms A, B and 
C in UCI's Student Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Part 2 of "Eyes on the Prize" will be shown at 2 p.m. today in the video 
lounge of UCI's student center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Black community leaders, including Randy Jordan, publisher of the Black 
Orange, will discuss issues such as education, police and media and the lack of 
a central core for black culture in Orange County at 7 tonight in UCI's Crystal 
Cove Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Friday, UCI's 10th annual march and rally will begin at Mason Park at 10 
a.m. and continue at noon at UCI's Gateway Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 * The New Spirit Baptist Church with Pastor Mark Williams will host the second 
of the "In the Spirit of Unity" services, at 7 p.m. Friday at 701 S. Sullivan 
St., Santa Ana. Pastor John N. McReynolds will speak.  
</P>
<P>
 * On Monday, a commemorative breakfast sponsored by the Neighbors, a black 
social and cultural organization, will be held at 9 a.m. at Burrell's Barbecue 
and Cafe, 14962 Sand Canyon Ave. in Irvine. The topic is "Continuing the Dream 
by Taking Our Children Back." 
</P>
<P>
 * A commemorative bust will be dedicated to King at the Gentle Spring on the 
campus of Chapman University near Palm Avenue and Grand Street in Orange. The 
program, from 1 to 2 p.m. Monday, will feature a recollection of King's 1961 
visit to the then-Chapman College, including readings of excerpts by Don Will 
and a musical performance by Clay Curtis and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People's Orange County 
chapter will host a "Celebration" program from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday at 
Valley High School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 * The last of the "In the Spirit of Unity" services will be held at Second 
Baptist Church at 10:45 a.m. Monday with host Pastor John N. McReynolds at 1915 
W. McFadden St., Santa Ana. Pastor Mark Williams will speak. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Jan. 20, an old-fashioned breakfast with music and speakers will take 
place at 8 a.m. at Southwest Senior Center, 2201 W. McFadden St., Santa Ana.

SCHOOL STILL DEBATING GAY RIGHTS; MORES: SUPPORT GROUP'S BACKERS AND ORGANIZERS 
TAKE COMFORT IN BOARD TRUSTEES' BACKING, BUT OPPOSING STUDENTS AND OTHERS SAY 
BATTLE ISN'T OVER. NEXT, A BEER CLUB? 
</P>

<P>
 While opponents of a gay support group at Fountain Valley High School vowed 
Wednesday to carry on their battle, supporters and members of the organization 
rejoiced in victory following a school board decision that allows the group to 
continue meeting on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the Board of Trustees) recognized that we have the right to exist 
and they recognized the value of all their students and their diversity," said 
senior Ron Katz, who is gay and a founding member of the Fountain Valley High 
School Student Alliance, which was formed in October as a support group for gay 
teen-agers. "We will continue to meet and do what we intended to do: to 
support, educate and encourage tolerance and acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Union High School District trustees voted 4-1 Tuesday night 
to leave intact a 1990 policy that allows equal access for all groups not 
related to the curriculum to meet in school facilities. Trustees decided to 
retain the policy as is rather than force the disbanding of an estimated 60 
groups that meet on the district's seven high school campuses. Trustee Dirk 
Voss cast the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people packed the board room and a nearby classroom set up with 
a public address system to accommodate the crowd. Those in opposition to the 
Student Alliance criticized officials for not holding the meeting in a larger 
facility. They also were upset that people from outside the community took up 
seats in the board room, while residents who arrived after the room filled to 
capacity were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 70 people addressed trustees during about 2 1/2 hours of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who have banded together in opposition of the Student Alliance 
expressed disappointment at the board's decision. To show what they said is the 
absurdity of the district's equal access policy, the students said they are 
gearing up to start new groups, such as a beer club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make the point that if you let in one (group) you have to let 
them all in, despite how immoral or damaging," said senior Robert Dodge, who 
has been a vocal opponent of the Student Alliance, which has about 45 gay and 
straight members. 
</P>
<P>
 The beer club, for example, would be open to any student who wants to talk 
about beer, students said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the board's decision drew applause from teachers, gay rights advocates and 
former students who are gay -- all of whom who have been closely following the 
issue since opposition started to mount last November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy that it passed. I really had my doubts if they would keep it 
open," said Kelly Bach, 27, a 1984 Fountain Valley High graduate who is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that they did it not only for the Student Alliance, but for the 
other groups," Bach said. "We're finally taking steps in the right direction. 
It's really important for people to learn to have tolerance for other people, 
whether the differences between people might be sexual orientation, religion or 
cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also need to learn to respect people's differences whether or not we might 
personally agree or disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Barnhill, a member of the Orange County Federation, a coalition of 
leaders from gay and lesbian groups, said the board's decision is a big step 
forward for the gay support group, but the elation may be premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a certain amount of caution about my celebration because this issue is 
certain to come up during school board elections," Barnhill said. "I'm sure 
some people running for the school board will use this issue to trigger voters 
who may be uneducated about the subject." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, critics of the decision said they plan to back new school board 
candidates or run for election themselves. One parent who addressed trustees 
Tuesday night even announced his candidacy at the podium, and Dodge said the 
idea to run has even crossed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Three board seats will be open for election in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach resident Bryan Bridges told trustees of his intention to run 
for a board seat. Leon McKinney, also of Huntington Beach, who ran 
unsuccessfully for a board seat in 1992, said he is considering seeking 
election as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is not having its needs and desires addressed," McKinney said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bridges said he publicly announced his candidacy because the current school 
board has "a blatant disregard for parents." 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need to know that there is someone out there running for office that 
has the parent in mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges also charged that trustees have a "disregard for the community. . . . 
They could have come up with a policy to allow parents to exercise some control 
over their children." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of parents Tuesday night said that the crux of the issue was parental 
rights -- that parents should have a say in whether their children are involved 
in such unofficial school-based organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the trustees' decision to keep the equal access policy is an order 
that parents be sent notices to inform them of the policy and list the various 
non-academic groups on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally feel that parents should be very much involved in what their 
students are involved in in school," said Board of Trustees President Bonnie 
Bruce. "Because (the district) is not sponsoring these groups, we cannot ask 
for (parents') permission. But I think we can try to make parents very much 
aware about the equal access policy -- with a statement that we do not endorse 
or sponsor any of these groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Fountain Valley High Principal Gary Ernst said Wednesday afternoon 
that the campus was quiet and calm on the first day after the decision.

L.A. CLEARED OF LIABILITY IN MCDONALD'S HOLDUP; POLICE: JUDGE RULES AGAINST THE 
FORMER SUNLAND MANAGER WHO SAID OFFICERS SHOULD NOT HAVE WAITED TO INTERVENE 
AFTER ROBBERS BROKE IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A judge Wednesday cleared the city of Los Angeles of any liability to the 
former manager of a McDonald's in Sunland because a police surveillance unit 
watched without acting for more than 30 minutes while robbers held her at 
gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Granting a defense motion at the close of the plaintiff's case, Glendale 
Superior Judge Charles W. Stoll issued a directed verdict in favor of the city 
and dismissed the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Los Angeles City Atty. Don Vincent said Stoll concurred in his two 
arguments that the law exempts police officers from liability and that the 
manager's 911 call for help did not create a binding relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bought all of the facts we had in the motion," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff's attorney, Christopher Hiddleson, said he would consider 
appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really up to my client," Hiddleson said. "This happened rather suddenly. 
We're still digesting the judge's ruling." 
</P>
<P>
 The former McDonald's manager, Robbin L. Cox, 26, of Pasadena alleged in her 
lawsuit that the Police Department's Special Investigations Section, which had 
followed four suspected robbers to the Foothill Boulevard restaurant Feb. 11, 
1990, should have stopped them before they broke in and, failing that, should 
have tried to stop the robbery in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 When she saw the men attempting to break in, Cox called 911 and was told a 
police car would be dispatched. But the leader of the 22-man undercover 
surveillance team called off the response by uniformed officers and ordered his 
men to wait until the four robbers emerged from the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 While the officers waited, the robbers blindfolded Cox and threatened her with 
death if she did not open the safe. 
</P>
<P>
 In gunfire that erupted as the robbers left the restaurant, three of them were 
fatally shot by officers and the fourth was wounded and captured. He is serving 
a 17-year prison sentence. It was later determined that their weapons were 
pellet guns. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in a federal lawsuit awarded the surviving robber and members of the 
dead men's families $44,000 on the grounds that members of the SIS team acted 
without cause when they opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the FBI is continuing to investigate possible civil rights 
violations in the shooting, an FBI spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox's lawsuit alleged that the police had a duty to come to her aid after she 
called 911 and that the SIS team breached that duty by calling off the 
uniformed response. 
</P>
<P>
 The official LAPD investigation of the incident concluded that the SIS team 
leader, Detective Brian Davis, learned of the 911 call only three minutes 
before the men got inside and that he decided not to rush them immediately 
because not all of them could be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony Wednesday, former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates 
conceded that Cox had reason to expect a police response, but defended the 
judgment of the SIS leader that rushing the four robbers inside the restaurant 
could have set off shooting that would have increased the danger to Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 Before putting on any witnesses, Vincent argued Wednesday that a 911 call does 
not create a special police responsibility to the caller. 
</P>
<P>
 He also cited the section of the state government code that says "neither a 
public entity nor public employee is liable for injury caused by the failure to 
make an arrest or by the failure to retain an arrested person in custody." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Hiddleson said he thought it was odd the motion was granted 
because another judge had denied an identical motion, citing both points, 
before the trial began. The state Supreme Court declined to review the city's 
petition seeking to overturn that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiddleson said he thought his case had established significant disputes of 
fact that could only be decided by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, although the police said the robbers broke in only three 
minutes after the SIS officers learned of the 911 dispatch, Cox testified that 
it was 15 minutes after the call when the robbers got inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a pretty significant factual conflict," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both attorneys said they talked to jurors afterward and found them divided on 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had varying opinions," Vincent said. "A lot for us. Some for him."

COLLARED!; DOGNAP SUSPECT ARRESTED, TERRIER RESCUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a brazen crime, carried out in broad daylight by a confident crook who 
nonchalantly told Henri Kemp that he would never see his beloved Maude again 
unless he followed instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a textbook dognaping case and the life of Maude, a 7-year-old Boston 
terrier, seemed to hang in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began Tuesday when Kemp's wife, Sandy, was listening to messages left 
on the family answering machine. Among them was one from a stranger saying 
Maude had been stolen and would be returned only if a ransom of $500 was paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Maude, the family's much-loved pet, had been snatched from the fenced yard of 
the couple's Woodland Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed, Kemp rushed home from his North Hollywood job and contacted police, 
who advised him to agree to the extortion demand and to meet with the dognaper 
in a public place. The thief called again, around 9 p.m., and they arranged a 
clandestine meeting in a parking lot at a Ralphs grocery store on Ventura 
Boulevard in Woodland Hills the following morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal: $500 and Maude comes home in one piece -- or else. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone, however, Kemp tried to strike a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I offered him $200 and he said he would shoot her, get rid of her or keep her 
for his own child," Kemp said. They finally settled on $450. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so cocksure of himself," Kemp recalled. "The confidence he had, like 
he was in total control of the situation. . . . He told me that he knew it was 
a valuable dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown to the suspect, a trap was being laid even as they spoke. Police would 
stake out Ralphs and move in when Kemp gave them a signal -- scratching the 
back of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Kemp met with Damani Grey, a 19-year-old Northridge man who was 
arrested in the case, at 9 a.m. Wednesday. Out of sight but nearby to spring 
the trap were 15 West Valley uniformed officers and detectives, and just in 
case -- a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I scratched the back of my neck, it meant I'd seen the dog and he'd 
asked me for the money," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in front of the store, Kemp said he was "petrified" as he waited to 
meet the dognaper. The man, who apparently had been waiting for Kemp, beckoned 
him to come over to his car to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kemp walked up to the car, he saw Maude sitting on the man's lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this your dog?" he quoted the man as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching from afar, Detective Larry Kagele said police moved when they saw 
Kemp "pull out his wallet and start counting money." 
</P>
<P>
 After Grey was taken into custody, Maude bounded out of the car and into 
Kemp's arms. Grey was booked on suspicion of extortion and is being held in 
lieu of $25,000 bail, Kagele said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp said he is puzzled why Maude was singled out, especially since he had 
never before met Grey. He speculated that Grey got his home phone number from 
Maude's dog tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he's pleased to have the dog, which he raised from a pup, back 
home. Maude was appreciative, too, giving free licks to a local newscaster and 
to the men who saved her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is just thrilled and she likes all the attention, but I hope she doesn't 
get it in her head to do this too often," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, Maude will still have the run of the yard, just like she always 
had, but Kemp said he will now reluctantly bolt and lock the fence that 
surrounds the yard of their Laramie Avenue home.

 Gordon McClelland got hooked with citrus box labels 25 years ago as a 
teen-ager working after school at the old Sunkist packinghouse in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 McClelland said he was drawn to the sunny images of bountiful fruit and 
picturesque landscapes that many citrus companies used to advertise their 
products during the first half of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something American about them," said McClelland, a Santa Ana author 
who has collected more than 8,500 different labels from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, he will join label collectors from around the state at the 
Sunkist building in Sherman Oaks to view, sell and trade their labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange box labels from Orange County are featured prominently in the 
collections of McClelland and many other label enthusiasts. Some of the most 
rare and valuable ones came from orchards in Santa Ana, Villa Park and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Most orange labels are 10 by 11 inches. Starting in the late 19th Century, 
citrus companies began attaching them to the sides of wood crates as a way of 
distinguishing their products. The labels also served to advertise the 
communities where the fruit was grown, said Bob Taaffe, a collector in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Labels from Orange County often depicted blue skies and sun-drenched orchards 
-- tempting images designed to lure Easterners out West. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many have a natural California theme," Taaffe said. "We have them from 
practically everywhere in Orange County except the coastal areas." 
</P>
<P>
 In time, the labels grew more complex and colorful. By the 1920s, selling the 
fruit became more important than promoting the state, and the labels 
increasingly contained pictures of large and juicy-looking oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 The labels disappeared in the 1940s, when orange farmers began shipping their 
fruit in cardboard boxes instead of wood crates, Taaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
 But interest in the artwork on the boxes persists. More than 100 collectors 
are expected at Saturday's convention, where rare labels could sell for more 
than $1,000. The Sunkist building is at 14130 Riverside Drive in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more famous Orange County labels is the Auto Brand of Tustin, which 
shows a turn-of-the-century automobile driving through an orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewes Transcontinental Brand of Orange printed labels showing a map of 
California next to a train with oranges and lemons on the sides of track. 
</P>
<P>
 A picture of a mansion framed by palm trees graced labels from Mother Colony 
Brand of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County produced some very nice labels," said McClelland, 42, who has 
written two books on orange crate labels, including "California Orange Box 
Labels" (Hillcrest Press). 
</P>
<P>
 McClelland came across his first citrus labels in the 1960s while working at a 
packinghouse in Orange, which stored old labels in its basement. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in Orange County, McClelland has visited dozens of packinghouses as 
far away as Florida and Texas in search of labels. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; 2ND ARREST MADE IN FALL DRIVE-BY KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A second suspect has been arrested in connection with an October drive-by 
shooting outside a cafe here that killed one man and injured two others, police 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tung Thanh Le, 21, was arrested at his Torrance home Tuesday morning without 
incident, Sgt. Dan Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Le is suspected of being in a car that passed by the night of Oct. 20, police 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Le and several other men are suspected of driving by Cafe Gia Hoi, 9106 
Edinger Ave., and firing on three men who were walking out of the restaurant, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims was hit in the neck and foot and fell in front of the cafe 
as patrons and employees ran outside after hearing gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other victims ran but were followed by the assailants into a 
residential neighborhood on Sweetleaf Street. There, one man was shot in the 
chest and the other in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim with the head wound, Tu Anh Nguyen, 19, of Garden Grove died four 
hours later at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors have since been released from the hospitals and are recovering, 
Bean said. Their names have not been released to protect them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Le was being held at the Huntington Beach City Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The first suspect, 27-year-old Phuong Phuc Le of Garden Grove, was arrested 
about a week after the shooting and is being held without bail at the Orange 
County Jail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two suspects are not related, Bean said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; HER SPECIALTY IS MAKING REALITY OUT OF WISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You might say Mary D. Allen is in the dream business. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen is too hardheaded to see it quite that way. But the description is apt 
for a woman who is just as energetic a philanthropist now as she was a 
businesswoman who made her money running the Beacon Oil refinery back when 
women were only supposed to inherit fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 She gave $3 million to build a tower at the Doheny Eye Institute, and there is 
a lobby named for her in an orthopedic hospital downtown. She donated her first 
guide dog for a blind person in 1970. Now, she is up to 25. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years back, Allen was touring the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation's 
quiet residential campus, which nestles against the Santa Susana Mountains in 
Chatsworth. Allen turned to Norma Mowrey, the smiling, fast-talking 
administrator of the five-acre facility, and asked, "What are some of your 
dreams?" 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our dreams is to enclose the pool," Mowrey replied. The pool outside 
the main administration building not far from where Amtrak trains roar by 
several times a day is one of the residents' favorite places. In the water, 
they can make their twisted and constricted bodies obey them better. Yet the 
pool could only be used three months of the year because victims of cerebral 
palsy, which is not a disease but a collection of physical symptoms caused by 
brain injury, are susceptible to the elements and are particularly vulnerable 
to pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen nodded to Mowrey. "You've got it," she said. "How much do you need?" 
</P>
<P>
 Flabbergasted, Mowrey estimated that $50,000 would do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, by the time the Mary D. Allen Aquatic Therapy Center was dedicated 
Wednesday, the bill had grown to almost $200,000. But Allen, who was honored at 
a special ceremony in the facility, now surrounded by 15,000 square feet of 
glass, said she never gave her commitment "a second thought." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only pleasure they have in life," she said of the 65 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 That might be a bit of an overstatement, but you couldn't tell it from the 
reactions of three cerebral palsy sufferers who were brought in for an 
impromptu therapy session while about 40 dignitaries of various stripes looked 
on. Two men in wheelchairs made plaintive noises and a young woman, the only 
one of the three who was ambulatory, wrapped her thin legs around her therapist 
in her eagerness to get to the water. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is not just a place for recreation and relaxation. Mowrey explained 
that it allows the tensed muscles to relax and helps prevent osteoporosis, a 
common problem for those with cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 When Allen stepped up to a microphone a few feet from the water to accept a 
bouquet of flowers, she received a prolonged round of applause that echoed off 
the reinforced glass walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's charitable work has added years to her life. When someone guessed her 
age as 65, she laughed uproariously. She is 82. 
</P>
<P>
 While Allen was still accepting thank-you handshakes, Mowrey went off to give 
another tour. JOHN JOHNSON

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MTA TO CONSIDER BID TO MOVE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board is scheduled Thursday to 
consider new information regarding a proposal by MCA Inc. to move a planned 
Metro Rail station half a mile closer to its Universal Studios and CityWalk 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will consider a staff report released last week that said moving the 
station from Lankershim Boulevard to a site underneath the Hollywood Freeway 
would increase the $420-million construction bill by as much as $41 million and 
cause a 21-month delay. 
</P>
<P>
 And because MTA faces a projected $126-million deficit next year, the report 
recommended that the relocation plan be rejected unless new construction 
funding is found. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA executives, who met last week with state Trade and Commerce Agency 
Secretary Julie Meier Wright to discuss location of the station, still insist 
that it should be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, MCA has been pressing transportation officials to move the 
station to better serve patrons of the amusement park. Company officials have 
also threatened to withhold $6 million in special property assessment fees if 
the station is not moved. Under a provision in a 10-year-old state law, they 
are entitled to do that. SCOTT GLOVER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NIGHT CLOSURES OF 2 PARKS APPROVED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to late night drinking, loitering and other problems at O'Melveny 
and Little Bee Canyon parks, the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously 
Wednesday to keep the parks open only between sunrise and sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 The two adjacent parks in Granada Hills are currently open between 5 a.m. and 
10:30 p.m. Together, the parks comprise more than 700 acres of open space and 
represent the second largest city park. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Hal Bernson, whose district includes the two parks, has said 
that the parks have recently suffered problems with car racing, drinking, 
loitering and graffiti. In addition, people have fired guns in parking lots and 
other areas around the parks, particularly on weekends. HUGO MARTIN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; WINDS, DRY WEATHER TRIGGER FIRE ALERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High Santa Ana winds and low humidity Wednesday prompted the Orange County 
Fire Department to declare the year's first red flag fire alert. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the fire season, so we expect these kinds of things to happen," said 
Emmy Day, a public information officer for the department. "All of this stuff 
is well planned in advance so, in a sense, even though conditions have changed, 
it's business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the alert, Day said, the Fire Department dispatched two special 
patrols -- one to the Riverside Freeway near the border with Riverside County 
and the other to the canyon area of Santiago Canyon Road -- consisting of 
department personnel especially trained in wild-land management and fire 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "That gives us extra sets of eyes out there to report any indications of 
fire," she said. "We also hope that the patrols will act as a deterrent to 
anybody who might be thinking that this might be a good time to set a fire." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Day said, the department formed two strike teams consisting of 
five fire engines each, which are stationed at firehouses near John Wayne 
Airport and on Santiago Canyon Road near Irvine Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be ready to go out should anything occur," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the department is dispatching extra fire engines to all structural 
fire calls for the duration of the alert. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday afternoon, Day said, those calls had not exceeded their usual 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 The red flag alert was declared early Wednesday when winds reached 37 m.p.h. 
with gusts in some areas as high as 64, Day said. At the same time, she said, 
relative humidity dropped to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Red flag alerts -- which occur several times a year -- are declared when wind 
speeds exceed 25 m.p.h. and/or humidity drops to 15% or less. Such an alert was 
in effect last fall when the Laguna Canyon fire began, Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials were not overly concerned Wednesday about the possibility 
of fire, Day said, continuing hazardous wind and humidity conditions this year 
have prompted them to prolong the official fire season, which usually ends in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 The department was to check conditions again late Wednesday night to determine 
whether the fire alert would continue. 
</P>
<P>
 A meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which issues forecasts for The Times, 
predicted hazardous conditions for at least two more days, with winds 
decreasing and humidity increasing through the weekend. DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; PLANS OKD FOR NEW FUNDAMENTAL SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The school district board has approved plans for a new intermediate 
fundamental school, although questions remain concerning where the school will 
be built. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Santa Ana Unified School District board unanimously voted to 
designate Intermediate School No. 9 as a fundamental school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamental schools combine traditional instructional programs with strict 
dress and behavior rules and strong parental involvement. They are also 
extremely popular, so much so that parents routinely camp out on nights before 
registration days for the chance to enroll their children. The waiting list for 
students at MacArthur Fundamental Intermediate School, the only current 
fundamental intermediate school, includes 460 students, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Where and when the new fundamental school will be built depends on whether the 
board approves a controversial plan to construct the campus as part of a 
$43-million "space saver" project. Under that proposal, which state officials 
have agreed to fund, the school would be built as an addition to the Bristol 
Market Place, said Mike Vail, senior director of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board approves that site, the new school could open by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The space saving school would include a three-story classroom building and be 
designed to conserve land. Space-saving schools are intended to provide an 
innovative way to eliminate the need to condemn property when building schools, 
Vail said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has received enthusiastic support from some parents, but others 
have criticized the placement of a school at the shopping center.  
</P>
<P>
 The board will consider whether to approve the space-saver project at a public 
hearing at 7 p.m. on Feb. 1. The meeting will be held at Rancho Santiago 
College's Phillips Hall, at 17th and Bristol streets.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SCHOOL BOUNDARIES MEETINGS PLANNED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westminster School District will hold six informational meetings for 
parents about possible school boundary changes resulting from the reopening of 
Neomia B. Willmore Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings will be during the last week of January and the first week of 
February at several school sites, said spokeswoman Audrey Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 When Willmore reopens in the fall, it will draw 550 children from other nearby 
schools. As a result, the district must balance enrollment at these other 
campuses, including Virginia K. Boos, Ada E. Clegg, Frank N. Eastwood, James W. 
Franklin, C. Fred Schroeder and L.P. Webber elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees will consider the comments from parents when setting the 
new attendance boundaries. Supt. Gail Wickstrom will make her recommendations 
to the board on Feb. 3. A public hearing on the proposal will be held Feb. 17, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district plans to reopen Willmore -- at 7122 Maple St. -- in part because 
hundreds of students who live nearby are now bused to other campuses, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings will be at 7 p.m. on the following dates and schools: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 24 at Virginia K. Boos Elementary School, 13890 Hammon Place, 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 25 at James W. Franklin Elementary School, 14422 Hammon Lane, 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 26 at C. Fred Schroeder Elementary School, 15151 Columbia Lane, 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 27 at Ada E. Clegg Elementary and Helen Stacey Intermediate schools, 
6311 Larchwood Drive, Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 31 at Frank N. Eastwood Elementary School, 13552 University St., 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 2 at L.P. Webber Elementary School, 14142 Hoover St., Westminster.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; NEW SHELTER TO GIVE YOUTHS PLACE TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington Youth Shelter, designed to be a safe place for runaways in 
Huntington Beach and surrounding cities, is scheduled to officially open this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders will participate in a ribbon-cutting ceremony Friday at 
12:45 p.m. at the 18-bed facility, located in Central Park just east of the 
Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine View School musical choral group will entertain, and Huntington 
Beach High School students will conduct tours until 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the shelter will be able to accommodate nine boys and nine girls, it 
is expected to start with about four youths before gradually increasing to a 
full complement in about six months, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The young people will stay a maximum of two weeks. They will receive 
counseling, and officials will try to reunite them with their families. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter building was initially constructed in the 1930s for the Chevron 
oil company, officials said. Volunteers did major remodeling and doubled the 
size of the old home to 4,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, on an acre site, was leased to Huntington Youth Shelter 
officials by the city for $10 a year for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Kanode, a nurse in the Huntington Beach Union High School District, 
co-founder of the shelter and member of its board of directors, said the 
shelter is the largest of its kind for runaways in the Huntington Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanode said she got the idea for the shelter in 1987 when a student told her 
that she had turned to prostitution and drug dealing to support herself because 
she had been abandoned by her mother and had no place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter, at 7291 Talbert Ave., is designed for youths of ages 11 through 
17.ROBERT BARKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; 60-ACRE ANNEXATION REQUEST TO BE HEARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A request by the city of Calabasas to annex about 60 acres -- which contain 
the Motion Picture and Television Fund home, the Leonis Adobe and half of a 
condominium complex -- has been scheduled for a hearing before a committee of 
the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The land -- within the city of Los Angeles -- is bounded to the east by 
Mulholland Drive and to the north by the Ventura Freeway.Calabasas officials 
argue that Mulholland and the freeway are logical boundaries for their 
2-year-old city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of confusion over where Calabasas ends and where Los Angeles 
begins," Calabasas Councilwoman Lesley Devine said. "It's clearly a public 
safety issue when it comes to the response of the police or the fire department 
because there are different jurisdictions." 
</P>
<P>
 The current boundary also places the south side of an area known to locals as 
Old Calabasas within the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy the way it's divided," Devine said. "We can't get anything done." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Planning Commission in November split over the request, and 
made no recommendation to the City Council on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the Los Angeles city administrative officer found the detachment 
would cost Los Angeles $150,000 a year in lost property taxes and utility fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee is 
scheduled to hear public testimony at 1 p.m. Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the detachment, the proposal would be forwarded to the 
Local Agency Formation Commission, which oversees boundary changes. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; PETTING ZOO OWNER SUES TO HALT CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a Reseda pony ride and petting zoo has filed a lawsuit to prevent 
the city from closing her business, an attorney for the farm said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday, 
means that city attorneys will most likely postpone any action to close down 
The Farm on Tampa Avenue, which has been denied permission to operate by the 
City Council last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Menary, owner of The Farm, has been fighting neighborhood opposition to 
her business for several years. The business, located on about 1 1/2 acres, is 
flanked on two sides by single-family houses. It is home to dozens of chickens, 
ponies, goats and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say that the place smells, and that escaping animals are a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the business was put in doubt last month when the City Council 
rejected Menary's final appeal for a land-use permit. While the case was still 
wending its way through the city zoning process, Menary was allowed to continue 
operating in accordance with the terms of an earlier plea negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city did not move in immediately to close The Farm down after the 
council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, at a progress report hearing in Los Angeles Municipal Court 
before Commissioner Mitchell Block, Menary's attorney, Harold Kippen, argued 
that until Menary's lawsuit is settled in court, she should be allowed to 
continue operating without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard A. Schmidt, deputy city attorney, said that although the matter is 
still under review, the city is not likely to challenge Menary's right to 
continue operating her business while the case is being adjudicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, a writ of administrative mandamus, has not yet been scheduled for 
a hearing, Schmidt said. Kippen said the writ challenges the City Council's 
denial of a conditional-use permit for Menary. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Menary was working as usual at her farm on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has really changed here," she said. "I still think the city has been 
terribly unfair. All the big businesses are running out. Now they are chasing 
out all the little ones too." JILL LEOVY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; FIREFIGHTER CUTS FOOT IN RESIDENTIAL BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A firefighter sustained minor injuries Wednesday when a piece of glass or 
ceramic material pierced his boot and cut his foot as he battled a fire that 
destroyed the roof of a historic home and a residential garage next door, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Paul Bartley was treated for his injury at St. Jude Medical Center and 
released back to duty, Fire Chief William R. Simpkins said."He got three or 
four stitches and is doing fine, but the garage is completely destroyed and the 
historical house's roof collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire has not yet been determined but firefighters, who 
contained the flames within 20 minutes, are investigating, Simpkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the garage, in the 200 block of Redwood Avenue, were asleep in the 
house when the fire occurred at 10:48 a.m. Neighbors awoke the two sleeping 
owners to alert them to the blaze, Simpkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic home, known as the Practice House among Brea residents, was 
vacant and sitting on blocks. City officials said a developer is in the process 
of moving the 66-year-old home to another neighborhood, where it will be 
renovated and sold to low-income buyers as part of the city's low-income 
housing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers estimated the damage to the home's clay roof at $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The Practice House was originally part of Brea-Olinda High School. Students 
learned how to cook, sew and fix household appliances in the building, which 
was moved away from the high school grounds in 1989 when the school was 
demolished and rebuilt.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; COFFEE-CART BUSINESS GRINDS TO A HALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has ordered the owner of the city's only drive-through 
espresso cart to halt his 7-month-old business. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission met Monday to consider granting a permit to Patrick O'Brien, 
who said he sells espresso and cappuccino to about 80 people each day from a 
cart in front of an abandoned Der Wienerschnitzel drive-through hot dog stand 
on 17th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said he opened the stand after a former business partner assured him 
that permits already had been obtained. "I never intended on moving in there 
and operating illegally in the black-market area," he told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 People can pull up to the stand and buy coffee without leaving their cars. 
O'Brien, an espresso bar caterer and coffee merchant in Los Angeles, said he 
knows of no other drive-through coffee carts in Los Angeles or Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner John Palme led the opposition to the cart, saying: "This is the 
wrong place at the wrong time for the wrong reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 The espresso cart is caught in the middle of a battle between the city and 
Eugene Scarcello, who owns the land where the cart is parked. 
</P>
<P>
 The city may sell the access road that people use to drive up to the coffee 
cart. A doctor, Brennan Cassidy, has applied to develop a site next door, 
possibly eliminating the drive-through, according to associate planner Gabriel 
Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarcello is suing the city to block development of the access road. "If this 
project is approved, it blocks my access, and limits the use of my property," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarcello said O'Brien is "getting a beating because of the situation between 
the city and me and Dr. Cassidy." 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Chairman Walter M. Davenport agreed after the meeting that the 
access road is a crucial issue, and also said that the city is cautious when 
considering permits for outdoor commercial developments.  
</P>
<P>
 According to a staff report, permits have been issued for sidewalk sales, 
outdoor flower displays and parking-lot sales. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said he will appeal the commission's decision to the City Council. He 
will also apply for a push-cart permit, which Elliott said would let him 
operate from a sidewalk. WILLSON CUMMER

 A couple was robbed of $168,000 worth of computer chips, jewelry, cash and 
guns by five suspected gang members in a home invasion style robbery, police 
said Wednesday. A 21-year-old female family member was raped with a foreign 
object during the takeover, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, three of whom were armed with handguns, approached the 
middle-aged couple as they entered their Van Nuys home about 6:30 p.m. Monday 
and occupied the house for five hours, tying up the couple and four other 
family members. Police said they believe the men, identified as being 25 to 30 
years old, were after $50,000 worth of computer chips kept in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be a target robbery," said Officer Russ Wong of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Asian Crime Investigation Section. "They had an idea of 
what they were looking for."  
</P>
<P>
 Police said they have no suspects in the case. JEANNETTE REGALADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH / COSTA MESA; SCHOOLS, BANK SETTLE 
NEGLIGENCE LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District has received a $575,000 settlement 
from Wells Fargo Bank in exchange for dropping its $3-million lawsuit alleging 
that the bank failed to protect district funds from an embezzlement scheme by 
former budget chief Stephen A. Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward H. Decker, president of the district's Board of Education, said at 
Tuesday night's board meeting that the settlement was reached last month and 
approved in concept by the board on Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are certainly pleased that this phase of the whole incident is complete," 
district Supt. Mac Bernd said. "There are an awful lot of people who want to 
move forward and put this behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd said the settlement stipulates that district officials cannot comment on 
its details. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner pleaded guilty in December, 1992, to embezzling about $4 million from 
district bank accounts, primarily from two employee health insurance accounts 
at Wells Fargo Bank, which district officials had thought were closed out. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's lawsuit contended that the bank had acted negligently in 
handling those accounts.  
</P>
<P>
 Between 1987 and 1991 at the Costa Mesa branch of Wells Fargo, Wagner withdrew 
funds from the accounts by obtaining either cashier's checks made out to 
himself or blank "counter checks" payable to a shoe repair firm that he 
co-owned. In some cases, Wagner was able to cash those checks with only his 
signature as authorization, whereas school district regulations require two 
signatures on such transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 In other instances, Wagner cashed the checks using his signature and a 
facsimile of Deputy Supt. Thomas A. Godley's signature, which the district has 
said was forged. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the settlement, Wells Fargo bank does not acknowledge any 
wrongdoing or negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner is serving a six-year term in state prison.BOB ELSTON

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; ARCHITECT HEARS GRIPES ABOUT SCHOOL DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, how do students and school officials at Burbank High like the campus and 
school buildings? 
</P>
<P>
 Not very much, an architect hired by the Burbank Unified School District to 
draw up plans for renovation of the campus found out at a meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and school officials told architect Tom Blurock that, among other 
things, the campus is ugly, ill-planned and confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "And can you try to paint the walls something a little less obnoxious?" asked 
Jennifer Smith, a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meeting was among the first in a series in which students, 
faculty, administrators and community members are being given a chance to meet 
with Blurock to voice their opinions about the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The district hopes voters will approve a $100-million bond measure in April to 
help finance the refurbishing of district buildings, including the two high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of the meetings was to help the students "buy into" the project, 
Blurock said. "You also get a lot of good ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, board member Denise Lioy Wilcox also recalled the school's ugly, 
yellow walls, which she opined had not changed since she was a student at 
Burbank 20 years ago. She said that she probably could still find the graffiti 
she once wrote as a student. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's main building was created from several smaller structures that 
were added on over the last 60 years or so. The result is a hodgepodge, 
creating an impossible situation for administrators, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Keiko Hentell said she wants to see a more open design with outer 
walkways because the crowded interior corridors that now exist create tension 
and safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at the meeting voiced their opinions on everything from the campus 
flora to sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we also get more grass and trees and flowers?" asked Sarah Goodlaw, a 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports and the locker rooms arose as what Blurock said will probably be 
longstanding issues in the redesign. 
</P>
<P>
 One student suggested putting all the sports facilities together. Another 
asked if Burbank High will get its own stadium, instead of having to use the 
field of cross-town rival John Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 A new stadium would be difficult because of the limited amount of land on the 
site, Blurock said. But it is something that will be considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blurock asked students if they would still want lockers for their books. The 
overwhelming majority raised their hands to say they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said after the meeting that officials are considering eliminating 
lockers for books, because they can be used to hide contraband. Instead, 
students would be given two sets of books, one for classroom use and another 
for home study. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; RENOVATIONS PLANNED TO REOPEN CITY POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are scheduled Thursday to unveil the design for a $1.2-million 
renovation to the swimming pool at the Su n Valley Recreation Center, which has 
been closed since the summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood children "need every diversion that can be afforded them," said 
John Vowels, the city's aquatics director for the Valley."I think the rebirth 
of this pool would go a long way in helping these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old pool was closed because it had become unsafe. The concrete 
decking was disintegrating and flaking, the pipes were rusted, and the gutter 
system was falling off. Winter rains also had damaged the outdoor locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will have an architect's rendering of the new pool facility 
available for a special meeting at 7 p.m. Thursday at the recreation center at 
8123 Vineland Ave. in Sun Valley. The design is similar to another city pool at 
the Stoner Recreation Center off Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for the pool to be replaced and the locker rooms rebuilt with 
roofs added. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents at the meeting Thursday will be asked to give their input or 
objections to the project. Construction could begin either in late spring or 
early summer, Vowels said. With a 10-month construction schedule, the new pool 
could be open for the summer of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to get this facility on line as soon as possible," Vowels 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7,200 people visited the Sun Valley pool in the summer of 1991. The 
nearest city pool is the Fernangeles Pool at Sheldon Street and Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard, about 2 1/2 miles away, Vowels said. That pool draws 15,000 to 
20,000 visitors a year, Vowels said. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CHAMBER DROPS PLAN FOR 2ND GLENFEST

<P>
 After the failure of its GlenFest street festival last year, the Glendale 
Chamber of Commerce has dropped plans for a second one, and instead will look 
into working with city officials to put on a smaller event in June, officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber officials said they would like to hold the event the same day that the 
city is planning a local promotion for the opening of the World Cup soccer 
finals, which will be held in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber board, which met on Tuesday, has not decided what type of event 
the group will sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to drop the idea of holding another GlenFest -- which lost 
$230,000 last year -- was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that if we had to, we could put on GlenFest," said Carvel Gay, 
chairman of the GlenFest committee "But we might not get enough support from 
the sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had also expressed doubts that Glendale would be willing to 
kick in funds for another GlenFest. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, I still have a lot of questions about the viability of GlenFest 
itself, and whether or not it's prudent for the city to help make contributions 
to it," said Glendale Councilwoman Eileen Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber General Manager Aulden Schlatter is expected to submit a report on the 
progress of the June event to the 17-member chamber board on Jan. 24. TOMMY LI

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CITY GOES AGAINST THE ECONOMIC TIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
 While Southern California's stubborn recession has wreaked havoc on many 
cities, San Fernando has skirted disaster and chugs steadily along, City 
Administrator Mary Strenn told business leaders Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been able to maintain and it clearly is due to the business 
community," Strenn said. "We're very vulnerable and very dependent on the 
business community." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, city officials had feared that Vons Grocery Co.'s decision to 
eliminate its Tianguis chain would mean the loss of a major supermarket, Strenn 
said. However, the El Monte-based company decided to replace the San Fernando 
Tianguis with a regular Vons market, she said. Similarly, the city feared 
losing Pace Membership Warehouse because of a corporate merger, but the new 
parent company replaced it with its own warehouse, Sam's Club. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to a recent study, there are sound economic reasons for San 
Fernando's stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are generally not rich -- the city's median family income is $32,128 
-- but they spend locally and loyally, making them a reliable economic force, 
according to a business retention study conducted by Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical shopper at the city's downtown mall is a Latino immigrant who 
prefers to speak Spanish, visits often, spends less than $50, shops with his 
family, and eschews checks or credit cards, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall merchants who attended the chamber meeting said business lags on 
weekdays, but bustles on weekends, when shops brim with regular clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you come by on the weekend, it's wild," said Patty Quezada, a board member 
of the San Fernando Mall Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, all may not be paradise at the mall. The report showed 42% of merchants 
polled had been victims of vandalism in a 12-month period, and reported that a 
third of their employees had been assault victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Strenn said she did not highlight the crime statistics because she questions 
their accuracy and wants to compare them with Police Department figures. Strenn 
said the word in Spanish used for "assault' in the surveys can be construed to 
mean any crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel we have a serious crime problem," said Esther Hellawell, vice 
president of the mall association and owner of a formal-wear shop that has been 
on the mall for 21 years. "Our police are there all the time and our parking 
lots are lit." 
</P>
<P>
 The report said few customers polled reported being crime victims, although 
they had a perception that crime was a problem. GEOFFREY MOHAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; PICKLER SEEKS TOUGH ANTI-SMOKING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A councilman wants the city to ban smoking in restaurants, retail stores and 
most other businesses, saying secondhand smoke is a danger to nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler wants the city to adopt the county's tough new 
anti-smoking ordinance, which will eventually ban indoor smoking at almost 
every business in unincorporated areas of the county except at non-retail 
enterprises where every employee smokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler on Tuesday asked the city administration to prepare a report detailing 
what effect a ban would have on Anaheim businesses. The report will probably be 
returned to the council in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, we have known the dangers of secondhand smoke," Pickler said. 
National health officials say 3,000 cases of lung cancer and 32,000 cases of 
heart disease among nonsmokers nationwide can be attributed to secondhand smoke 
annually. "We need to eliminate hazards that are out there that are dangerous 
to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Feldhaus said previously that he would oppose such a ban, 
saying it would be unnecessary government interference with private enterprise. 
The other council members had no immediate reaction to Pickler's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Hughes, executive director of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, said the 
business community would also oppose Pickler's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this should be an individual choice of the business owner and not 
a government edict," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's ordinance, which applies in unincorporated areas such as Sunset 
Beach and North Tustin and does not apply in cities, bans smoking in 
restaurants of fewer than 50 seats starting next month and larger restaurants 
next year. Retail stores and other businesses must also ban smoking by next 
year. Tobacco vending machines will also be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 The only exceptions are made for non-retail businesses such as a small 
manufacturer or a telephone solicitation office where every employee is a 
smoker. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Anaheim council unanimously adopted a ban on smoking in all 
city-owned facilities. Included in that ban is the Anaheim Arena and the 
seating area at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also has an ordinance, adopted in 1986, that prohibits smoking in 
elevators, theaters, public restrooms and public sections of hospitals and 
requires restaurants of 50 seats or more to have nonsmoking sections. It also 
requires most businesses that were not in operation when the ordinance took 
effect to allow smoking only in areas where nonsmokers will not be bothered.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; MORE CHARGES FILED AGAINST FIRED OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five additional felony charges were filed this week against a fired UC Irvine 
police officer accused of stealing computers and other high-tech equipment from 
campus buildings, the Orange County district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Eric Roberts, 34, now faces 22 felony charges.The incidents date back to 
1991, when a cellular telephone was reported stolen from a student residence 
hall during winter vacation, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Randy Pawloski. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years since, Roberts is suspected of stealing a variety of 
computer parts, portable radios, stereo speakers, videocassette recorders and 
an electric typewriter from classrooms and administrative buildings at the 
campus, Pawloski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest charges, which were filed Monday, include three more counts of 
burglary and two additional counts of selling stolen property. Prosecutors 
would not say if they expected to file more charges against Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Roberts nor his attorney, John Barnett, could be reached for comment. 
But Barnett had previously said that Roberts planned to plead not guilty to all 
charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who lives with his wife and children in Trabuco Canyon, could face up 
to 11 years in state prison if convicted. He joined the UC Irvine Police 
Department in 1984 and was fired Dec. 20 because of the criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts posted $10,000 bail last week. His arraignment has been postponed 
until Jan. 31.GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; CITY THINKS OF WAYS TO PROTECT ITS COFFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 How can the city keep the revenue it collects for developing and maintaining 
its parks, green spaces, recreation programs and clean, well-lit streets away 
from money-starved state coffers? 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Tim Casey says he's searching for an answer to that question. And 
City Council members said last week that they want to wait before deciding or 
asking residents to vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to move with caution on this," said Councilman Thomas W. 
Wilson. "I would like to maintain the status quo until all the reports are in." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are pondering the question because they are concerned that 
revenue the city collects from a special property tax could be targeted by 
legislators who are desperately seeking funds for deficit-plagued state 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel operates a Community Services District, or CSD, that assesses 
its own property tax. Revenues from the tax are dedicated solely to fund parks, 
recreation programs, street lighting, street sweeping, and maintenance of 
slopes and street medians. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal 1993, the CSD escaped a move by the state to shift a portion of the 
property tax revenue collected by cities and special districts to schools. 
Although the shift resulted in a $100,000 reduction in Laguna Niguel's general 
fund, it left the CSD's revenue unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent reason was that the CSD was one of only five special districts in 
the state governed by a city council and went unnoticed by state legislators as 
a potential revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
 This fiscal year, legislators found it. As a result, $1.1 million out of the 
CSD's anticipated $5.4-million property tax revenues were taken by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Now city officials are considering whether the city can best avoid future 
revenue grabs from the state by maintaining the CSD as it is or merging it into 
the general city budget. A merger would mean that parks, street lighting and 
sweeping, recreation programs and maintenance of medians and slopes would 
compete with other city needs for funds each year. 
</P>
<P>
 While saying they would consider the merger idea, council members stressed 
that they preferred to keep certain funds dedicated to those areas that 
beautify the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The green issues of this community are really protected with that CSD," said 
Councilwoman Patricia C. Bates. "I would hate to see that protection removed. I 
don't want to see it subjected to competing interests" of the general city 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey said he may have a clearer idea of what to recommend in coming weeks, 
when details of Gov. Pete Wilson's and state legislators' budget proposals 
become known. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, he admitted, he will feel ambivalent about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is a clear answer as to the path we should pursue," Casey 
said. "I'm bothered with the thought of tinkering with the CSD solely for the 
purpose of trying to guess the actions of legislators in the coming year." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has the power to decide if it wants to merge the CSD with the 
city's regular funding process. But council members said they would ask for 
direction from the city's voters, who approved formation of the CSD in 1986, 
three years before Laguna Niguel was incorporated as a city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would want to go to the people if a change is considered," said Councilman 
James F. Krembas. RICHARD CORE

MOTHER WILL FACE TRIAL ON BRIBERY CHARGES IN SONS' CASES; COURTS: BUENA PARK 
WOMAN ALLEGEDLY OFFERED MONEY AND JEWELRY IN EXCHANGE FOR SILENCE OF TWO

<P>
 A 43-year-old Buena Park woman will stand trial on charges that she attempted 
to bribe a pair of witnesses to dissuade them from testifying against her sons 
in two separate gang robberies, a judge ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trial for Maria Trinidad Rodarte, who authorities said offered witnesses 
money and jewelry for their silence, will begin Jan. 24, Orange County 
Municipal Judge Donald S. Macintyre ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodarte has been held in Orange County Jail in lieu of $40,000 bail since the 
day after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodarte allegedly offered to give a woman $500 if she would change her 
testimony about a robbery the woman had told police was committed by Lino 
Rodarte, 21, and other members of the West Trece gang. Investigators' accounts, 
culled from taped phone conversations between Rodarte and the witness, also 
allege that the elder Rodarte made veiled threats to the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The taped exchanges led to charges involving an earlier, unrelated case in 
which a witness allegedly accepted Rodarte's overtures and abruptly changed her 
testimony in a robbery and sexual battery case against 24-year-old Raul Beruman 
Rodarte. 
</P>
<P>
 Macintyre refused a request by the pastor of Rodarte's church, who asked to 
speak in open court on her behalf in hopes of having her bail lowered. The 
pastor, who met privately with the judge Monday, described Rodarte as "a good 
woman who made a mistake that any mother could make." 
</P>
<P>
 While prosecutors have called Rodarte's alleged crimes an affront to the 
sanctity of the judicial process, her attorney, Malcolm Gulesarian, said his 
client is being unduly targeted because of her sons' gang affiliations.

VAN NUYS MAN SENTENCED TO DEATH; COURTS: LANELL C. HARRIS WAS CONVICTED OF 
SHOOTING FATHER OF SIX AS THE VICTIM PLAYED CARDS IN A PARK. JUDGE CALLS 
KILLING 'COLDBLOODED, SENSELESS.' 
</P>

<P>
 A Van Nuys man who was on parole in 1991 when he fatally shot a man playing 
cards in a park was sentenced to death Wednesday by a judge who called the 
slaying coldblooded and senseless. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant, Lanell Craig Harris, should be put to death by the 
administration of lethal gas or lethal injection behind the walls of the state 
prison at San Quentin," said Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Bert Glennon Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 27, was convicted of shooting Julian Contreras as the father of six 
played cards Aug. 7, 1991, with several friends at the Van Nuys Recreation 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was robbing the card players when Contreras made a move and Harris 
opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the victim fell to the ground, the defendant simply executed him by 
shooting him in the back twice," Glennon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was convicted of first-degree murder for shooting the 51-year-old 
Contreras. An accomplice in the robbery has never been captured by police. 
</P>
<P>
 The muscular Harris, appearing in court in a jail-issued jumpsuit with his 
arms and leg shackled, showed no emotion when Glennon announced the sentence. 
In contrast, his wife and mother fought back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's mother, Doris Harris, said after the sentencing that her son 
was innocent and would soon walk free. "If Lanell was white, this wouldn't have 
happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had the money (to hire an investigator), he would have gotten off like 
the Menendez brothers are going to," she said outside Glennon's courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Michael Gottlieb urged the judge to overlook the jury's 
sentencing recommendation and instead send Harris to prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death is not the answer in this case," Gottlieb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glennon refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a coldblooded, senseless killing of a man who left a wife and six 
children and who the defendant later referred to as a sewer rat when bragging 
about the killing," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an automatic appeal in all death penalty cases to the California 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury split 10 to 2 in favor of guilt on a second murder charge stemming 
from the stabbing death of a South-Central Los Angeles doughnut shop employee. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels dismissed this charge Wednesday in light of 
the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was on parole at the time of Contreras' killing. He pleaded guilty in 
1985 to seven felony counts, including assault with a deadly weapon, burglary 
and robbery. He served less than six years of a 10-year sentence before being 
released from state prison in September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence at the trial showed Harris had visited his parole officer the morning 
he gunned down Contreras.

L.A., RESIDENTS PRESS NEW CHALLENGES OVER LANDFILL; GRANADA HILLS: THE CITY 
SUES BROWNING-FERRIS FOR COSTS OF FIGHTING DUMP EXPANSION. THE COMPANY'S 
ATTORNEY SAYS PETITIONS PROLONG THE CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The complicated legal maneuvering surrounding the proposed expansion of 
Sunshine Canyon Landfill dragged on this week with new challenges from Los 
Angeles city officials and San Fernando Valley homeowners -- including a 
request for the dump operator to pick up its opponents' lawyer bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Expansion of the controversial trash dump north of Granada Hills was attacked 
on a number of fronts in several legal documents filed earlier this week, 
adding new dimensions to the complex fight that has brewed in courtrooms and 
hearing rooms for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 A 58-page petition filed Monday by the city and the North Valley Coalition of 
Concerned Citizens seeks to overturn the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors' third approval of the dump expansion last November. Two prior 
approvals had been overturned by judges on technical grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether to allow the now-idle landfill just north of Granada Hills 
to expand by 17 million tons as part of a 10-year plan to increase the county's 
waste disposal capacity. The dump has been closed since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the issues raised in the petition are longstanding complaints of 
negligence and oversight that dump opponents have leveled for years against the 
county and the landfill's operator, Browning-Ferris Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition also contends the board ignored its own technical advisory 
committee, which had reservations about the expansion, and it questions whether 
the county even needs more landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said Wednesday that they continue to raise the same issues because 
county officials and Browning-Ferris executives continue to ignore 
environmental laws that require them to address how an expanded landfill would 
affect the natural surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes almost like my own white whale," said Mary Edwards of the North 
Valley Coalition, one of the dump's leading critics. "I feel like Ahab up on 
the deck stomping around." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a notable move, city attorneys on Wednesday sued Los Angeles County and 
Browning-Ferris to recover roughly $500,000 in legal costs they have run up 
fighting the expansion. Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker said the suit is 
allowed under a new state law that permits one government agency suing another 
over a public project to recover legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement with Los Angeles County, however, Browning-Ferris is 
responsible for all legal costs stemming from the board's approval of the 
project -- a figure that could swell easily to over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, a group of Latino residents who live near the landfill sued to 
overturn the Board of Supervisors' approval on the grounds that many Latinos 
were locked out of discussion on the project because documents were not 
published in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning-Ferris attorney Steven Weston had not yet seen two of this week's 
petitions, but called the challenge filed by the city and the North Valley 
Coalition "frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed they continue to rehash the same claims," Weston said, 
adding that the petition only served to prolong the controversy. He hinted that 
the landfill operator might strike back. "Our patience is wearing thin and 
management is a little bit fed up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the city's suit would have little immediate effect. The project is 
already under an indefinite stay until issues raised in earlier lawsuits are 
decided by higher courts and Browning-Ferris cannot proceed until the stay is 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pritsker said the city complaint will guarantee yet another judicial 
review of the project regardless of how higher courts rule. "Once you start 
ripping out oak forests, you can't undo that," said Pritsker, referring to the 
wildlife habitat the expansion would destroy.

COUNCIL AWARDS VICTIM OF SHOOTING $1.2 MILLION; WITNESSES: POLICE KNEW OF A 
THREAT TO KILL THE MAN TESTIFYING IN A ROBBERY CASE BUT NEVER WARNED HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to award $1.2 million to a former 
North Hollywood theater manager who was critically shot after police learned 
about a threat to kill the man but never warned him. 
</P>
<P>
 George Carpenter, 45, continues to suffer facial nerve damage and other 
physical and psychological injuries from the July 4, 1985, shooting that police 
believe was meant to stop Carpenter from testifying about a robbery he had 
witnessed at a North Hollywood theater he managed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Police Department investigation into the case determined that an 
LAPD detective had assured Carpenter that the robbery suspect was no threat, 
but other officers later learned that the suspect was soliciting a "contract 
hit" on Carpenter. Carpenter was never warned. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled in May, 1991, that the city became 
liable for the shooting when police assured Carpenter that he was in no danger. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued through his attorney, Thomas G. Stolpman, Carpenter said 
he was happy that the City Council approved his award and has promised to 
review the LAPD's policy for warning potential witnesses about similar threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is finally doing what I have always wanted -- taking positive action 
to prevent other victims from being injured like I was," he said. "Now, I can 
finally begin to put my life back together again after living in limbo for 
almost 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, who lives in seclusion outside the state, said he can now put the 
case behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of all, I feel relieved that this episode of my life is over," he said. 
"I lost my health and my career because the police didn't bother to follow up 
after finding out that I was in great danger." 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre case began in October, 1984, when Daniel S. Jenkins robbed 
Carpenter at gunpoint at the United Artists movie theater that he managed, 
according to a city attorney's report on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on information from Carpenter, police arrested Jenkins. During the 
preliminary hearing on the robbery, Jenkins threatened Carpenter, but LAPD 
Detective Thomas C. Williams assured Carpenter that Jenkins was just a "street 
punk" and not a real threat, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on July 4, 1985, Carpenter was shot by a gunman four times as he was 
having dinner next door to the theater, according to the report. He survived 
the shooting and was put in a witness protection program.  
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, after testifying against Jenkins in the robbery case, 
Williams was shot and killed in an ambush as he was picking up his son from a 
Canoga Park church school on Halloween night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins was later convicted of the robbery and in 1988 was also convicted of 
the attempted murder of Carpenter and the murder of Williams. He is currently 
on death row awaiting execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a police investigation into Williams' murder determined that three 
months before Carpenter was shot, two officers had interviewed an informant in 
Los Angeles County Jail who told them that Jenkins had been soliciting a 
"contract hit" on Carpenter, according to the city attorney report. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers who interviewed the informant passed the information on to the 
LAPD's North Hollywood Division, the report said. However, a North Hollywood 
officer denied he had received the warning and it was never passed on to 
Williams or Carpenter, according to the report.

<P>
 City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who recommended that the LAPD draft a report 
on its steps for warning witnesses of potential threats, said he hopes the case 
will force police to be more vigilant about protecting witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the $1.2-million settlement should not only have the effect of 
compensating the victim but of getting the attention of city policy makers," he 
said.

PROBATION FOR DISPOSAL OF DEAD INFANT; SENTENCING: WOMAN WHO TRIED TO CONCEAL 
HER PREGNANCY, THEN GAVE BIRTH TO STILLBORN BABY AT HOME, PANICKED AND LATER 
THREW IT AWAY, HER LAWYER SAYS.

 A Costa Mesa woman who threw her stillborn baby in a trash bin last November 
was sentenced to two years' probation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Aguilar Gonzalez, 26, had faced a maximum of 30 days in jail after 
pleading guilty Nov. 22 to a misdemeanor charge of illegally discarding the 
infant's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar Gonzalez refused comment Wednesday. But public defender Shelly Aronson 
said her client was embarrassed by her pregnancy and became scared when she 
realized that the newborn girl she delivered alone at home was not breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She basically just panicked . . . and it snowballed," Aronson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of probation, Aguilar Gonzalez will probably be asked to attend 
parenting and counseling classes as well as a first-aid class, Aronson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar Gonzalez was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after the child's 
body was found in early November at an Irvine trash transfer station. But she 
was later charged only with improperly disposing of human and fetal remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials said the baby suffocated on amniotic fluids. 
</P>
<P>
 The unmarried woman had hidden her pregnancy from her roommates before giving 
birth in the apartment they shared, Aronson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was embarrassing for her. She hoped to hide from everyone that she was 
pregnant and go to Mexico to have the baby," Aronson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronson and prosecutors said Aguilar Gonzalez hid the baby's body in her 
apartment for several days, then wrapped it in a plastic bag and carried it on 
the bus on her way to work as a housekeeper in Newport Beach. She discarded the 
body in a trash bin behind a Newport Beach apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby, also named Veronica, was given a funeral service in Orange last week 
by a nonprofit group called Child Rest in Peace, which provides burials for 
abandoned or indigent children. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronson described Aguilar Gonzalez as a very responsible woman who has worked 
for five years as a nanny and housekeeper for a Newport Beach family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt we'll ever see her in court again . . . she just needs some classes 
in coping," Aronson said.

ALARCON REASSIGNS AIDE AFTER CONSTITUENTS' COMPLAINTS; CITY COUNCIL: LEO 
BRIONES IS TRANSFERRED FROM VALLEY LIAISON TO MAIL OPERATION. THE DECISION 
FOLLOWS REPORTS OF VERBAL ABUSE BY HIS DEPUTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first shake-up of his staff since taking office, City Councilman 
Richard Alarcon has transferred one of his deputies after allegations that the 
aide verbally abused constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said Tuesday that the move of longtime aide Leo Briones to the 
constituent mail operation from his duties as a community liaison in North 
Hills and Panorama City was not a demotion, but a reassignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman said he wanted Briones to run an upcoming constituent 
newsletter to take advantage of Briones' journalism skills. Briones served as 
Alarcon's press secretary during the councilman's campaign this past spring and 
worked at KCBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Alarcon conceded that he was prompted to make the move after "a 
number of concerns from the community that were raised about Leo." 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt there was a need to take action," Alarcon said of the complaints. "I 
think the fact that I took action in short order is indicative of my 
recognition of the potential for harm." 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer comes after Alarcon was told about several incidents involving 
Briones. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Blythe Street activist Rae Sheffield said she tried to reach 
Briones for help with a shuttle bus that did not show up to provide rides to 
Fulton Junior High School for Blythe Street students. Briones, who had helped 
to acquire the shuttle, was out of the office, so Sheffield spoke to another 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Sheffield said, Briones called and cursed Sheffield for 
"going over his head" to Alarcon and "making him look bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield called Alarcon to complain about the profanities. A meeting was set 
up in late December, where Alarcon asked Sheffield to confront Briones. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not admit (using profanity) nor did he deny it," Alarcon said of 
Briones' response. "Instead, he apologized for any disrespect he might have 
shown." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Alarcon also was told about other incidents, one of which 
involved a person who was the target of profanities from Briones. Alarcon was 
told that Briones was rude and hostile. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Alarcon acknowledged receiving the complaint. Briones could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said he will have deputies Marcos Castaneda and Carlos Penilla 
temporarily fill Briones' former field position until a replacement is found.  
</P>
<P>
 The decision to transfer Briones was met with mixed reaction in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very relieved," Sheffield said. "I felt that Leo was a bad reflection on 
Richard's office. And Richard really cares." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it took a lot of guts to do what Richard did," said another person 
who had earlier reported being mistreated by Briones. 
</P>
<P>
 Some constituents said it will be hard to fill Briones' shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be sorely missed," said Harry Coleman, who coordinates the 
North Hills Task Force and worked with Briones on the North Hills Community 
Impact Team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had a problem with Leo," said Tony Swan, president of the North Hills 
Community Coordinating Council. "He's been very responsive to the needs of the 
community."

RESIDENTS DEMAND CHANGE IN TOLL ROAD PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 100 residents packed City Hall on Wednesday night and demanded that the 
City Council change a controversial segment of the San Joaquin Hills toll road 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters, mostly members of the grass roots group called Save Our San 
Juan, or SOS, claim an interchange to be built in San Juan Capistrano linking 
the toll road and the freeway will be too near their homes, causing noise, 
pollution and lower property values. The group passed out flyers that dubbed 
the interchange the "San Juan Y," named after the often-congested El Toro "Y" 
about seven miles north on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The group wants to move the interchange north on Interstate 5 toward a 
commercial area near the tri-city border of Mission Viejo, Laguna Niguel and 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toll road as it is designed now is going to seriously, seriously 
adversely impact San Juan Capistrano," said Robert P. King, a San Juan 
Capistrano resident and spokesman for the 461-member SOS group. 
</P>
<P>
 King lashed out at a city-sponsored consultant's report that suggested the 
move of the interchange north would be too costly and impractical. King said 
the report, written by Irvine-based UMA Engineering Inc., was biased because 
the company had worked for the Transportation Corridor Agencies, which oversees 
the building of the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the consultant was tainted and could not be objective," King said, 
adding that despite any action by the council, "we will not end (our fight) 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the report, the city staff recommended the City Council reject plans 
for studying an alternative interchange and proceed with local construction 
that would prepare the city for the arrival of the toll road. Included in that 
work is the controversial widening of Rancho Viejo Road -- a freeway frontage 
road -- that will cut into private property and a Montessori school. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meeting was the latest in the three-year-long confrontation 
between the SOS group and city officials over the toll road, a 15-mile, 
$1.1-billion roadway now under construction that will link the Corona del Mar 
Freeway in Newport Beach and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The grass-roots group is part of a coalition of environmental organizations 
formed to fight the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 The group emerged in San Juan Capistrano in early 1991 when the previous City 
Council supported the toll road project, which will wind through Laguna Niguel 
and merge with the Interstate 5 freeway near Avery Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 The interchange between the toll road and the freeway is now the thrust of 
their protest. SOS claims the project will devastate several neighborhoods in 
the northern section of San Juan Capistrano including Country Hills, Village 
San Juan, the Spotted Bull communities and Stoneridge. 
</P>
<P>
 King and his group claim to have designed an alternative that would have saved 
further road widening. 
</P>
<P>
 But TCA engineers and a city consultant called that alternative impractical 
because it does not meet federal highway design standards and would adversely 
affect private property along the highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the meeting, City Councilman Gil Jones said he was leaning toward going 
along with the staff recommendation and getting on with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have reviewed this thing enough and beat it to death," Jones said. 
"We have given everyone an opportunity to express their views. Our consultant 
says it's not feasible."

2 MORE ENTER SUPERVISORIAL RACES; POLITICS: MADELENE ARAKELIAN IS CHALLENGING 
SEN. MARIAN BERGESON. HAYDEE TILLOTSON ENTERS A RACE TO REPLACE SUPERVISOR 
HARRIETT M. WIEDER.

<P>
 Two Orange County businesswomen, both political novices, announced their 
candidacies Wednesday for separate seats on the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Madelene Arakelian, 60, co-owner of South Coast Refuse Corp., will challenge 
state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) for the South County district post 
being vacated by retiring Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Haydee Tillotson, 55, owner of a Huntington Beach-based property management 
company, enters a race to replace Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who also is 
retiring from local politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Both declared themselves non-Establishment candidates who would seek to 
rejuvenate a board long controlled by incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a career politician," Tillotson said. "I am entering public service 
because I am convinced that the problems we are facing won't be solved through 
politics-as-usual approaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson's candidacy has been actively promoted by Wieder. At a news 
conference Wednesday, Tillotson said that if elected, she would not accept a 
county car or the $823 per month car allowance provided to supervisors as part 
of their benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder has recently drawn criticism for driving a new county car valued at 
$29,000 for use during her last year in office and for the cost of repairs on 
her previous county cars. The four other supervisors also drive vehicles valued 
at $20,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not accept a taxpayer-provided car, because it is time for government 
to set a better example of how tax money should be used," Tillotson said. The 
money "should be invested in the community, not in the perks of office." 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson, however, said she thought it would be "grandstanding" to try to 
impose that policy on other county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson served on the Orange County Planning Commission last year, but 
resigned after three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Tillotson said she resigned to avoid any possible conflict of 
interest as she solicited money to run for supervisor. "I felt it would be 
inappropriate to solicit campaign funds from individuals and companies whose 
projects might come before the commission," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign disclosure statements distributed by Tillotson show that she has 
raised $53,000 in contributions and has loaned the campaign $200,000 in 
personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Councilmembers Linda Moulton-Patterson and Jim Silva have 
indicated their intention to run for the same seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In South County, Arakelian, whose persistent questioning of county waste 
management issues has led her to butt heads with county staffers and 
supervisors, promised to bring a new perspective to the county if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, the same rhetoric comes from the same leaders, but the problems 
keep getting larger," Arakelian said Wednesday. "We constantly have the same 
people in power or others recycled from other government jobs. If these people 
have always been there, why are we in the position we are in today?" 
</P>
<P>
 The county is most vulnerable, Arakelian said, in developing strategies to 
attract or keep businesses in Orange County. "We've got to be more friendly to 
business," she said. "Right now, we're just driving them away." 
</P>
<P>
 In her numerous encounters with supervisors, Arakelian said she has found them 
to be "inaccessible" or "uninterested" in the concerns of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Arakelian has been particularly critical of the board for what she describes 
as a penchant for awarding government work to a core of businesses to the 
exclusion of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County doesn't need a professional politician spewing the same old hot 
air," she said. "This county needs tenacity and a true Californian who 
remembers growing up in this state with California pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Arakelian, a Laguna Hills resident whose company provides garbage collection 
services, said she is prepared to raise about $200,000 for the race against 
Bergeson. While the state senator has picked up endorsements from Riley and the 
four other supervisors, Arakelian said she will wage a "door-to-door" campaign 
for the support of residents in the sprawling South County district.

JEALOUS BOYFRIEND GETS LIFE IN PRISON FOR ATTACK ON MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys man who was so convinced that his girlfriend was cheating on him 
that he slashed the throat of her suspected lover was sentenced Wednesday to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Jose Wilfredo Hernandez, 25, attacked Gustavo Mena on Nov. 
29, 1992, after his longtime live-in girlfriend falsely reported that she was 
seeing Mena and then helped lure him to the site of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene Schempp sentenced Hernandez after 
commenting on his "savage brutality." 
</P>
<P>
 When under pressure, according to Schempp, Hernandez "reverts to the use of a 
reptilian brain and strikes out savagely." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's girlfriend, Adriana Casillas, testified during the trial that 
after years of physical abuse her boyfriend forced her to lure Mena to a 
darkened street, where he was attacked by Hernandez and two friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Hernandez forced Casillas to lick the victim's blood from his fingers, 
according to her testimony. "Out of jealousy and for no reason whatsoever, he 
almost kills an innocent man," Schempp said. "I believe this was an inhuman act 
that you did to society . . . and society does not deserve the likes of you on 
the streets again." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the life term for his attempted murder conviction, the judge 
sentenced Hernandez to an additional 10 years in prison for striking Casillas 
with a hammer during one beating and of holding a knife to her throat as he 
demanded sex only hours after stabbing Mena. 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas testified that she gave Hernandez the name of Mena, who was a 
co-worker at a department store, in the hope of ending five years of almost 
daily beatings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in the case unanimously agreed that Casillas acted only in fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Mena nearly died from the attack and was saved when a good Samaritan came to 
his assistance and summoned medical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Mena did not testify at Hernandez's trial, and authorities said he may have 
fled to Mexico out of fear.

BURBANK STUDENTS STAGE PROTEST OVER DRESS CODE; SCHOOLS: ABOUT 60 YOUTHS JOIN 
WALKOUT. THEY VOICE ANGER AT NOT BEING CONSULTED ABOUT BAN ON GANG ATTIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chanting "no dress code," about 60 Burbank High School students staged a 
walkout Wednesday to protest a new districtwide ban on gang-related attire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really did it just so that they would listen to us," said Raquel 
Castaneda, a 16-year-old sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of mostly juniors and sophomores said they were angry that the new 
code was written and implemented without consulting students. After walking out 
of school at 10:15 a.m., the students had planned to march to Burbank City Hall 
to voice their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no arrests, but about half of the students were escorted back to 
school, some in police cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although school administrators fully support the ban, they said they also 
respect students' concerns about being included in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel that they were left out and it's a legitimate concern," Assistant 
Principal Gaylene Van Zjill said. "We're going to show them the way they can 
adequately air their complaints before the school board and the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout began near the end of a nutrition break when groups of students 
jumped a fence and marched to the front of the school and toward City Hall. 
After police escorted students back to school, Van Zjill spent 90 minutes 
talking to the students, listening to their concerns and explaining the 
school's position. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students left the meeting with a new view of the administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the administration and the students have an understanding, that they 
support us," junior Monique Herrera said. "They're willing to help us voice our 
opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera and a few other students made it to City Hall on Wednesday but were 
told they needed to take their concerns to the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban, which went into effect in all Burbank schools Jan. 3, prohibits 
numerous articles of clothing including oversized pants, white T-shirts, black 
and white Starter jackets, belts with initialed buckles, baseball caps and 
bandannas. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was implemented, at least four high school students and two middle 
school students have been suspended for violating the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Denise Wilcox said the code is based on provisions of a 
state law that went into effect last year, allowing districts to adopt 
anti-gang dress codes. The board also consulted with the Burbank Police 
Department and school officials during a workshop last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't see there was a lot of room for debate," Wilcox said. "That's why 
there weren't a lot of workshops to get student input." 
</P>
<P>
 Response among students has been mixed. Some wholeheartedly support the ban, 
while others have argued that some of the banned clothes are merely a fashion 
statement, not an indication of gang membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wears baggy clothes," Castaneda said. "I wear baggy pants and we 
are not gang members. It's also an issue of economics. No one has $200 to buy 
four new pairs of pants."

LAW FORCES SCHOOLS TO OFFER 'EQUAL ACCESS' TO ALL GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most Orange County school districts have adopted "equal access" policies to 
prevent discrimination on the basis of religious, political or philosophical 
differences. Under the federal Equal Access Act, it is illegal for a public 
secondary school to bar one group of students from meeting on campus during 
non-instructional time if the district has already allowed other organizations 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the law, whenever one student group is allowed to meet, there is 
a "limited open forum" that entitles other groups to the same privilege. The 
act withstood a legal challenge in 1990, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
a public secondary school that allowed chess, scuba and service clubs to meet 
could not ban religious clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of Orange County's 27 school districts have not passed "equal access" 
policies. Consequently, no student groups are allowed to meet on campus for 
other than school-related reasons in the Saddleback, Irvine, Tustin and 
Capistrano unified districts.

FRAUD IS ALLEGED IN TROUBLED SALE OF 2 VALLEY HOSPITALS; HEALTH CARE: FIRM IS 
ACCUSED OF INFLATING PRICE OF FACILITIES IT SOLD TO A COMPANY THAT LATER 
DEFAULTED ON A STATE-INSURED LOAN. SALE MAY COST TAXPAYERS $167 MILLION.

<P>
 State officials have alleged fraud in the sale of two San Fernando Valley 
hospitals to a company that later defaulted on a state-insured loan, 
potentially saddling California taxpayers with the $167-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusation is contained in a claim filed this week in the bankruptcy case 
of Nu-Med Inc. in federal court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The state alleges that Nu-Med inflated the price of the two hospitals when it 
sold them to Triad Healthcare Inc. In late 1990, when Triad was negotiating for 
a loan guarantee from the state's Cal-Mortgage program, three of the company's 
executives were also top executives of Nu-Med. 
</P>
<P>
 "These key management personnel, serving a dual role as high ranking officers 
of both Nu-Med and Triad, apparently caused Nu-Med to supply financial 
information and assumptions that were used by consultants engaged by such 
management personnel to support the apparently inflated value assigned to the 
assets," the state asserts in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim alleges fraud and misrepresentation by Nu-Med. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad officials said the state's action took them by surprise. In a statement 
Wednesday, Triad Chairman Sanford Weiss said he recently was assured by the 
director of Cal-Mortgage, Dennis Fenwick, that there was no evidence of "any 
wrongdoing in connection with the transaction." Fenwick could not be reached 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also denied that Triad representatives, including those who also 
served as Nu-Med officers, supplied misleading information about the true value 
of the hospitals. "At no time did any representative of Triad attempt to 
influence determination of fair market value of the assets," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nu-Med officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, the Assembly Health Committee has scheduled a Jan. 18 
hearing to examine "conflict of interest issues that were raised by the loan 
guarantee for Triad Healthcare," a committee spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those called to testify are David Werdegar, director of Cal-Mortgage's 
parent agency, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD); 
Larry Meeks, OSHPD's director at the time Triad's loan guarantee was approved; 
Stuart Marylander, who was president of Triad and vice chairman of Nu-Med 
during the negotiations, and Vincent Forte, a member of Cal-Mortgage's advisory 
loan committee at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Forte abstained from voting and acted as Triad's broker in the deal. At the 
time, Cal-Mortgage had no policy prohibiting loan committee members from 
representing applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Forte, a vice president of the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs and Co., 
has resigned from the Cal-Mortgage loan committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Marylander, who is no longer an executive with Triad or Nu-Med, declined 
through a spokeswoman to comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Triad default raises very troubling questions about the Cal-Mortgage loan 
process," Committee Chairman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) said Wednesday 
through a spokeswoman. "It's a financial disaster that the state can 
ill-afford. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of this investigation will be how this loan guarantee ever won state 
approval given the apparent conflict of interest that existed." The spokeswoman 
said Margolin was referring to relationships between members of the advisory 
loan committee and Triad officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Triad loan was the largest ever guaranteed by the 25-year-old Cal-Mortgage 
program. Its default last July forced state officials to suspend the 
Cal-Mortgage program, which many nonprofit health care organizations have 
relied upon to obtain low-interest construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The default also jeopardizes the future of the two hospitals Triad bought with 
the loan proceeds, Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center in Sherman Oaks, and 
West Valley Hospital and Health Center in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Triad is unable to resume loan payments, a Cal-Mortgage loan guarantee 
requires the state treasury to cover the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-Mortgage officials appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson have been critical of the 
Triad deal, which was approved in the waning days of the George Deukmejian 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported last month that the advisory loan committee recommended and 
Meeks approved Triad's loan guarantee despite warnings from a Cal-Mortgage 
staff analyst that the relationship between Triad and Nu-Med did not appear to 
be "arm's length" and that the actual value of the two hospitals was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenwick said the bankruptcy court action is necessary to protect the state's 
financial interests as Triad's largest creditor.

CB RADIO ENTHUSIAST FINED $50 BY HOMEOWNERS GROUP; TECHNOLOGY: NEIGHBORS HAD 
COMPLAINED OF INTERRUPTED TV AND PHONE SERVICE BY THE SCOUT, EVEN THOUGH HE 
USED THE DEVICE TO HELP SAVE STRANDED BOATERS. 
</P>

<P>
 A citizens' band radio enthusiast was fined $50 Wednesday by his homeowners 
association for his radio conversations, which have interrupted his neighbors' 
telephone and television reception but also helped save a family stranded on a 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moulton Parkway Homeowner's Assn. No. 1 voted 5 to 1 to fine Richard 
Wright, 20, after neighbors complained of both repeatedly interrupted reception 
and profanity. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the fine, a letter will be sent to Wright notifying him that he 
will face a $50 fine for each subsequent complaint of his CB radio usage. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least once, the CB came in handy. On Dec. 28, through a series of 
questions and communication relays, Wright, an Eagle Scout, and two other CB 
radio operators were able to approximate the location of a stranded boater with 
engine trouble in Dana Point. He forwarded that information to the Coast Guard, 
which sent a rescue helicopter from San Diego. The boaters, four adults and two 
children, eventually were rescued by two boats from the Orange County sheriff's 
patrol boat and Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than a hero's welcome for Wright, his use of the radio upset 
neighbors, who complained that cordless telephones and television reception 
were continually interrupted by the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "This little Richie and his CB friends talk on their radios to meet girls at 
the park and use profanity all the time," said Vicki Karr, 40, a mother of two, 
who lives near Wright and complained to the homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
 Karr accused Wright of being racist, claiming he has called her children, 
whose father is black, racist names more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a hero," she said of Wright. "This is a problem. This kid from 10 
o'clock at night to two in the morning is out there on his CB talking to his 
friends. It's difficult to sleep at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Lansdell, 42, a former resident at the same complex, said her 12-year-old 
daughter couldn't walk to her friend's house without Wright and his friends 
making catcalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the problem with the neighbors or myself is that he did a 
wonderful thing saving those people in the boat," Lansdell said. "I don't think 
anybody is disputing that. But the problem is that they are using the CB for 
other purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lansdell had hoped Wright would get fined. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been given every chance," she said. "The neighbors have gone nicely 
to these people asking them to please turn down the CB, at least during the 
evening hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Karr complained to the Orange County Human Relations Commission about the 
racist comments she said he made. Rusty Kennedy, the commission's executive 
director, confirmed that the commission stepped in to conduct informal 
mediation in March, 1993, between Karr and Wright's mother, Sue Sampsell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The complaint had to do with profanity and racial comments made by a resident 
there," Kennedy said. "I spoke with both parties back and forth about their 
problems with each other trying to reduce the conflict between them. But it 
resulted in both parties choosing not to have or continue any formal 
mediation." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright could not be reached for comment.

PROTEST AGAINST MEXICAN GOVERNMENT HELD AT CONSULATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 70 people marched outside the Mexican Consulate on Wednesday night to 
protest the government of Mexico and voice support for an Indian guerrilla 
movement in the southern part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators called for the government of Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari to institute democratic reforms and help indigenous people 
in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our demonstrating here, out of the country, is very valuable because it's the 
only place we can do it and the Mexican government will begin to feel pressure 
from people all over the world," said Jose M. Villanueva, 25, a mechanic from 
Santa Ana. He noted that similar demonstrations have been staged in San 
Francisco and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators carried placards reading "Salinas -- Traitor" while two dancers 
in feathered headdresses jumped to the beat of a bass drum in front of the 
consulate on North Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Consul General Felipe Soria Ayuso spoke to several Mexican 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican government has been taking steps toward reforms," Soria told 
them. But one demonstrator responded, "While the people starve." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas faces growing political strife in Mexico following the rebellion by a 
group claiming to fight for indigenous rights in the impoverished south.  
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas, calling themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army, 
stormed several cities in the south on New Year's Day. On Tuesday, Salinas' 
government stepped up peace efforts with a call for a truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mexico City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis, recently appointed as peace 
negotiator, has suggested that the guerrillas could be recognized as a 
legitimate entity. The government must listen to them if they are to reach an 
end to the conflict, Camacho has said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PERIODIC 4-DAY WEEK WEIGHED FOR SANTA CLARITA 
EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's all a matter of time for city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has staffed City Hall with half the usual number of workers 
every Monday, giving half the work force a day off every other Monday for the 
past two years.Department heads say this system creates difficulty for 
residents trying to contact city employees, slows productivity as employees 
cover for missing workers and limits when staff meetings can be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members are trying to decide if it's better to have city offices 
half-staffed Mondays or closed completely every other Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The modified schedules are part of Santa Clarita's efforts to meet South Coast 
Air Quality Management District standards. The AQMD requires employers with 100 
or more employees to reduce the number of trips made in cars to work by 
encouraging car-pooling or alternative transportation such as public transit or 
bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Tuesday continued discussion of the matter while staff members 
take a closer look at AQMD standards and how important the staggered schedules 
are to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 185 full-time city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the new schedule would shut down city offices every other Friday 
and extend employees' work day from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The move would also 
better align city schedules with Los Angeles County Public Works, Regional 
Planning and other offices that are closed every Friday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SMOKING BAN IS CLOUDED IN THE FACE OF 
OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fate of a strict smoking ban in restaurants and workplaces has become 
hazy, with the City Council backing away from a broad ban it had supported last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to hold two more public meetings on the 
issue and conduct a survey of restaurant owners about enforcing their own 
smoking controls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confrontation on this issue is very, very unwise," said Councilman Carl 
Boyer, who asked for the additional meetings. "It's one of those issues that 
will tear apart the community. One side always loses." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's proposed tobacco control ordinance would prohibit smoking in 
restaurants, workplaces and enclosed public areas. Bars that generate less than 
25% of their income from food sales would be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decision frustrated anti-smoking advocates who thought that the 
issue was resolved Dec. 14 when the council voted 4 to 1 in favor of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going back to Square 1. We're going back to where we were six 
months ago," said Councilwoman Jill Klajic, who -- joined by Mayor George 
Pederson -- opposed the additional meetings. "We've had hearings. We've had 
lots of hearings. Why are we opening it up again?" 
</P>
<P>
 One reason was the nearly 200 people who packed the council chambers Tuesday 
night. It was the first time that discussion of the smoking ban had drawn a 
large crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant owners complained that a ban would drive customers out of Santa 
Clarita and into nearby unincorporated areas where patrons could smoke without 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Others called the legislation intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why aren't we going to restaurants and telling people they can't serve fatty 
food because it's bad for people?" one restaurant owner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Los Angeles and dozens of other cities in the state have smoking 
controls, the one proposed by Santa Clarita is broader than most. Banks, 
Laundromats, shopping centers, theaters, restaurants and retail stores are 
among the establishments covered by the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say adoption of smoking controls in other nearby cities, most 
notably Los Angeles, brought the debate into Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "In six years, I don't think I got one complaint about smoking in Santa 
Clarita until Los Angeles passed its ordinance," said Councilwoman Jan Heidt, 
who prefers to allow businesses to make their own rules about smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the strong smoking controls say the issue is one of health 
rather than personal freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't have the right to interfere with the health of another person," 
said Donna Pugh, the Canyon Country resident who began the anti-smoking drive 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a smokers versus nonsmokers issue," Klajic said. "I 
certainly don't think it has anything to do with your rights. It's a health 
issue." Smoke Out Areas where smoking is restricted in and around the San 
Fernando Valley: 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills: Most restaurants and public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas: Most restaurants and public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank: Places of general assembly, such as theaters, and some City Hall 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale: A proposed ban on restaurant smoking was shot down by business 
opposition several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster: City buildings and most enclosed public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles: Hospitals, police stations, elevators, theaters, City Hall and 
most restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale: Buses, cabs and most enclosed public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita: City Council says it will survey restaurant owners and hold two 
more public meetings before making a decision on a proposed smoking ban. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando: City Council is considering a resolution that would limit 
smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Village: Smoking banned in restaurants, workplaces, hospitals and 
recreation areas.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN TO STAND TRIAL IN DEATHS OF 2 WOMEN; 
LANCASTER: JUDGE ORDERS HOMER TYRONE LEWIS TO FACE MURDER CHARGES. WITNESS 
TESTIFIES HE THREATENED ONE VICTIM JUST HOURS BEFORE KILLING. 
</P>

<P>
 A Lancaster man accused of murdering two women allegedly threatened the life 
of one of the victims just hours before she was killed, according to court 
testimony Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Ian Grant ordered Homer Tyrone Lewis, 29, held for trial on 
two charges of murder, after a preliminary hearing that lasted nearly five 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is accused of killing Lisa Juve, 21, and Diana Cross, 22. The women were 
shot the morning of Oct. 20 in Juve's Lancaster apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Juve's daughter, who was 15 months old at the time, and Cross's daughter, who 
was 2 months old, were in the apartment at the time of the shooting. The 
children, as well as Juve's 4-year-old son, are in the custody of family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Juve was pronounced dead at the scene from two gunshot wounds to the head. 
Cross died Oct. 29 of a single gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who was living with his pregnant wife in Lancaster, was paroled from 
state prison four months before the shooting. He was released three years 
before completing a 13-year sentence for fatally shooting a teen-ager during a 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Juve and Cross met Lewis at a party about two weeks before the shooting and 
Cross began an affair with him, Valbert Lumas of Lancaster testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and Cross got into a fight at a party at Juve's apartment and Lewis hit 
Cross in the face, Lumas said. Juve, Lumas said, called the Sheriff's 
Department. According to Sheriff's Sgt. Ken Gallatin, before deputies arrived, 
it was agreed that Lewis would go home and deputies would be told everything 
was fine. 
</P>
<P>
 If the deputy had been told what Lewis had done, Lewis likely would have been 
arrested for violating his parole, Gallatin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumas testified that Lewis left the party shortly after the incident early in 
the morning of Oct. 20, but called Juve's apartment later that morning, telling 
Lumas several times that "he'd kill her (Cross) if she wouldn't get on the 
phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross never did speak on the telephone that morning to Lewis, according to 
Lumas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 26 in Superior Court. Prosecutors, 
alleging special circumstances, may seek the death penalty.

THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY; TIMES MIRROR, PACTEL PLAN VENTURE; 
COMMUNICATIONS: THE SERVICE WILL OFFER HOME SHOPPING AND TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT 
AND OTHER INFORMATION.

<P>
 In a deal that anticipates the multimedia future, Times Mirror Co. and Pacific 
Telesis Corp. said Wednesday that they have formed a joint venture to provide 
electronic home shopping and other consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
 The new service, which is expected to be launched in November in Southern 
California, will allow consumers to shop for items over the phone or personal 
computer. In addition, it will tell them about local restaurants and 
entertainment events and help with travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Media companies, which produce vast amounts of information and other editorial 
content, are looking for ways to participate in the coming information 
superhighway, which is expected to facilitate everything from movies on demand 
to home shopping and long-distance learning. 
</P>
<P>
 The past year has seen a flurry of partnerships between longtime rivals, such 
as newspapers and phone companies, as they look to pool resources and assets in 
an effort to create interactive services whose use they hope will one day be as 
routine as driving a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Cox Enterprises Inc., owner of the Atlanta Journal and 
Constitution, and BellSouth Corp. announced a joint venture to develop and 
market electronic information services of newspaper classified and yellow pages 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of Times Mirror, owner of the Los Angeles Times, and Pacific 
Telesis said the joint venture will essentially create a computer-aided 
electronic version of a business phone directory that will enable customers to 
search for products or services nearest their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Users will be able to conduct searches through a number of cross-referenced 
categories such as make and model, price and location. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard T. Schlosberg III, publisher and chief executive of The Times and 
executive vice president of Times Mirror, said the joint venture will 
"accelerate (the company's) expansion into new technologies," in addition to 
providing new sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times will contribute marketing and promotion backing to the venture as 
well as a link to Times advertisers and subscribers. Pacific Telesis will 
provide technical support. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, customers will be able to call a "shopping assistant" who can match 
a product or service the caller is looking for with a store or business in 
their area. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, the venture will also allow users to search for that information via 
a home computer and see a picture of it on their screen. Once high-capacity 
telecommunications lines are in place, users will be able to watch a "full 
motion video" of the advertised product over a television set -- for example, a 
videotaped tour of a house for sale or a video of a used car advertised in the 
classifieds. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning sometime this fall, businesses in a five-county area including 
Orange County will receive solicitations to subscribe to the service. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture has not decided where it will locate sales offices. Hal 
Logan, general manager of Pacific Telesis Electronic Publishing Services, said 
he would not rule out an Orange County site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is a big and important market for us," Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial service to be offered "only describes what is visible on the 
horizon now," said Lee Camp, president of Pacific Telesis Electronic Publishing 
Services and vice president of Pacific Bell. "More important is intent. This 
will evolve under its own steam in response to the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The venture will initially target the Southern California market, but plans 
call for seeking partnerships with other newspapers to provide services around 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many experts are bullish on the prospects for commercial ventures on 
the information superhighway, it is unclear exactly what services or 
applications will prevail. Media companies, especially newspapers, are expected 
to introduce a variety of services in the coming years to build upon their core 
business of providing information. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis is the parent company of regional telephone company Pacific 
Bell. Times Mirror also owns Newsday in New York, among other newspapers, and 
Times Mirror Cable TV, which serves more than a million subscribers.

 $28-Million Verdict Against Transamerica A Los Angeles jury hit the former 
Transamerica Insurance Co. with the bad-faith verdict Tuesday for failing to 
make good on surety bonds after the contractor on a Malibu condominium project 
went bust. Transamerica wrote bonds guaranteeing that the contractor, Cates 
Construction of Lancaster, would finish the 21-unit project and that its 
subcontractors and material suppliers would be paid, according to Paul Shoop, 
lawyer for Talbot Partners, the condo developers.But when Cates abandoned the 
project and went out of business, Transamerica refused to pay for its 
completion, arguing that there was a dispute over whether Talbot had lived up 
to its part of the contract with Cates, Shoop said. Talbot subsequently lost 
the property when its bank foreclosed on the construction loan. In the ensuing 
legal action, an arbitrator ruled that Transamerica had breached its bond 
contracts and awarded Talbot $4,098,000 in damages and legal fees. Then, in a 
separate bad-faith trial, a Superior Court jury assessed the $28-million 
punitive judgment. Transamerica Insurance, formerly based in Woodland Hills, 
has since separated from Transamerica Corp., moved to New York and renamed 
itself TIG Holdings.

BRIEFCASE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; COSTA MESA'S DESIGNS ON ST. JOHN KNITS PLANT 
COULD BE UNRAVELING

 Costa Mesa city officials are hopeful that St. John Knits Inc., the Irvine 
apparel manufacturer, will build a new headquarters and manufacturing facility 
on 15 vacant acres just down the street from South Coast Plaza, but St. John 
officials say they are looking elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently approved preparation of an environmental impact 
report on a proposed 300,000-square-foot St. John's building on land off 
Sunflower Avenue owned by the Segerstrom family.Once the report is completed, 
city officials could pass the zoning changes needed to permit a commercial 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very confident this headquarters will be built. The people at St. John 
seem very enthusiastic and Henry Segerstrom himself said it was a go," said 
Donald Lamm, Costa Mesa deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Don Shaw, a real estate consultant working with St. John, which has 
operations in several buildings in Irvine, cited the regulatory difficulties 
involved in building a new manufacturing facility in California as one reason 
the project may not be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The St. John's people are still looking at other sites and they could decide 
to just expand where they are now," Shaw said. Founded 31 years ago, St. John's 
designs and manufactures expensive women's knit clothing.

STORES ARE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUIKSILVER; MARKETING: SURF WEAR FIRM'S 
EXPANDED LINE, INCLUDING CHILDREN'S AND WOMEN'S FASHIONS, IS OFFERED IN 
LICENSED BOARDRIDER CLUB OUTLETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quiksilver has built its image on hard-core surfing jams, T-shirts and caps. 
</P>
<P>
 But the surf wear company's new Boardrider Club retail store on Forest Avenue 
in Laguna Beach shows clearly that the brand encompasses a whole lot more, 
including a growing line of women's and children's fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 Peek into the display window, and you'll see women's dresses, accessories and 
tops. Close by is a new line of clothing for boys ages 4 through 7. Nestled in 
the back is a decidedly upscale line aimed at older guys with bigger bucks to 
spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiksilver has licensed the Boardrider concept to store owners in Laguna 
Beach, Santa Cruz, Hawaii and Utah. The outlets are designed to turn a profit 
for their owners, but they are also to serve as retail laboratories where 
Quiksilver can show surf shop owners and department store buyers how to 
maximize sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiksilver executives say that the stores' blend of men's, women's and 
children's clothing lines proves to retailers that surf designs "can be 
inclusive rather than exclusive to hard-core surfers," said Randall D. Hunt, 
the Laguna Beach shop's co-owner and a member of Quiksilver's corporate board. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Quik sells through a department store, our pants get mixed in with 
everyone else's pants, and the (design) magic is lost," Hunt said. "But with 
Boardrider Club, it's sort of like Banana Republic done with a Quik twist." 
</P>
<P>
 To grasp the breadth of Quiksilver's growing product line is difficult in a 
department store, which will typically have shelf space for only a few surf 
wear items, Hunt said. And, surf shops generally buy stock from dozens of 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1,850-square-foot store on Forest Avenue, however, every shelf and 
display rack is dedicated to the Costa Mesa-based company's lines. Hunt and 
co-owner Eric John will add other manufacturers' clothing, but the store will 
always showcase Quiksilver's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average surf shop owner doesn't know this (type of sales presentation) is 
possible," said John, who also owns Laguna Surf and Sport store and Second Reef 
Surf Shop, two nearby specialty stores. "This shows them how to operate a 
retail store as opposed to flying by the seat of their pants." 
</P>
<P>
 John, who has been in the surf wear business for 12 years, said that shop 
owners typically view the Quiksilver store either as "a threat to their 
business or as an opportunity to learn how to increase their sales." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quiksilver isn't the only surf wear maker using "company stores" to showcase 
its offerings. Mossimo and Stussy have their own stores, and Gotcha recently 
introduced a "shop concept" that stakes out space inside existing surf wear 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Noble, owner of specialty store Newport Surf & Sport in Newport Beach, 
described the Gotcha shop within his store as "nothing different than what 
Ralph Lauren did in Macy's with the Ralph Lauren store." 
</P>
<P>
 Mossimo Giannulli, who opened his signature store in November at South Coast 
Plaza in Costa Mesa, has said that the shop is designed to emphasize that his 
growing lines of clothing and accessories extend far beyond beachwear.

 Stake is Sold: A health care company in Burlingame said Wednesday that it has 
bought a 60% interest in South Coast Rehabilitation Services in Laguna Hills, 
which supplies therapy services for nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivra Inc. said it was interested in South Coast because it fits with its 
strategy of investing in companies that have an edge over competitors. South 
Coast has developed a special software that enables it to improve its service, 
said Kent Thiry, Vivra's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast's management keeps ownership of the remaining 40% of the company. 
Other terms of the deal were not disclosed.

 Listings Agreement: Several regional multiple-listing services for home sales 
are expected to announce today in Upland that they have agreed to allow free 
access to each other's listings and will work to set up a common database 
system, a spokesman said Wednesday.

nearly 70,000 listings of homes for sale in an area that includes much of 
Orange County: Anaheim, Laguna Beach, Santa Ana, Mission Viejo and San Juan 
Capistrano.While the listing services have not merged, they will share 
information at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good thing for both brokers and home buyers," said Bill Jones, 
chairman of the Southland Area Listings Enterprise, the task force formed to 
develop the expanded access. 
</P>
<P>
 The participating listings services are Multi-Regional Multiple Listing 
Service, which covers the Inland Valley; Orange County Multiple Listing 
Service; Inland Empire West Assn. of Realtors; Pomona Valley Board of Realtors; 
and Redland Board of Realtors. Listing services that cover Newport Beach, Costa 
Mesa and Huntington Beach are not included.

the freeway. It now displays the white-lighted Bristol Park Medical sign. "We

 Building Up Appetites: Birtcher Construction Ltd. in Laguna Niguel recently 
released "The Groundbreaking Gourmet," a collection of recipes collected by the 
Birtcher families and company employees. The 103-page cookbook, which was 
recently distributed to all employees, is now handed out as a corporate 
gift."We decided on a cookbook because we had pot lucks once in awhile and 
several people were always asked to bring the same things because so many 
people liked them," said Julie Majors, an administrative assistant at Birtcher. 
Ron Birtcher, whose grandfather founded the company, contributed the dessert 
recipe for "Drunk Bananas," and the recipe for "Scrambled Eggs Legend," which 
includes ingredients such as caviar and chopped scallions. The book will not be 
available in stores, but employees can purchase extra copies for about $13.

HUGHES WINS $66-MILLION EXTENSION OF NAVY CONTRACT; DEFENSE: COMPANY WILL 
SUPPLY DATA DISPLAY EQUIPMENT FOR WARSHIPS. NO NEW JOBS ARE LIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co. said Wednesday that it received a late Christmas present: 
a $66-million contract to supply data display equipment for Navy warships. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract is not likely to result in any new jobs at the Surface Systems 
division of Hughes' Aerospace and Defense sector in Fullerton.But spokesman Dan 
Reeder said it will help stave off further layoffs among the remaining 7,000 
workers in the division, which has seen its work force shrink from a high of 
15,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder said this is the latest portion of a contract that will almost 
certainly grow to $143 million. It is another extension of a program that began 
about 10 years ago to interface radar, communications and weapons aboard 
advanced warships. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, you have to protect the programs you have had around for a 
while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy awarded the contract Dec. 29, but Reeder said a public announcement 
was not made right away. About 14% of the equipment purchased under the 
contract will be installed in Japanese warships. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder called the contract significant, but it is still dwarfed by the 
$867-million order that the division received in 1991 for a battlefield 
management system for Saudi Arabia. The Saudi contract, Reeder said, is about 
half completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension of the Navy contract could not have come at a better time. The 
Westchester-based unit of GM Hughes Electronics is beginning a six-month period 
in which executives say there will be no additional layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder said Hughes plans to "catch its breath" after steady job losses spawned 
by the defense industry's streamlining and recession.

 Wilson budget -- The Times incorrectly reported on Saturday that Gov. Pete 
Wilson's proposal to shift $5.4 billion to local governments included $1.4 
billion from Proposition 172, the sales tax increase approved by voters in 
November. The $1.4 billion for public safety provided by 172 is separate from 
the proposed $5.4-billion transfer.

3-HOUR TOUR: KNOTT'S GOTS LOTS TO DO AT ITS CALIFORNIA MARKETPLACE, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, Anne Michaud is a staff writer for The Times Orange County 
Edition.

<P>
 In these thrifty '90s, it's nice to know that you can check out the birthplace 
of the boysenberry without paying up to $25.95 a head in admission fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, which was the site of a 1930s fruit stand 
that popularized Rudolph Boysen's berry, maintains a section called California 
Marketplace that is open to the public -- even the parking is free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marketplace is a collection of more than 20 shops and restaurants, lined 
up along a main street, Grand Avenue, in the style of the Old West. And just 
across the way, through a tunnel that runs underneath Beach Boulevard, visitors 
can tour a replica of Philadelphia's Independence Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 12:30: I headed to the back of the Marketplace area first, just to get 
a sense of how big it is. If you do this too, you can pick up a map along the 
way at the information center. 
</P>
<P>
 The back section holds a water fountain surrounded in flowers and circled by 
several quaint shops. If you have small children with you, chances are you'll 
be drawn first in the direction of the Candy Parlour. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of place kids dream about. There are barrels filled with hard 
candy and taffy. Tall cylinders of jellybeans hold exotic flavors such as 
chocolate pudding and ice blue mint and tangerine. For older kids, there are 
boxes of chocolates and candy gifts: a champagne bottle filled with jellybeans 
and a bouquet of lollipops in place of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 12:30 to 1: Next door is the Garden Terrace Cafe & Bakery. Along with the 
baked goods, this cafe serves sandwiches, coffee and soft drinks. There are 
some umbrella-topped tables in front. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garden Terrace serves usual bakery items (doughnuts, muffins and oversized 
cookies) and some unusual items. The blueberry cheesecake, almond raspberry 
tart and lemon mousse squares looked tempting. 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1:30: Across from the Garden Terrace is a store labeled simply Souvenir 
Shop. Here, you can get all sorts of Knott's memorabilia, from coffee mugs to 
kitchen aprons to T-shirts stuffed into jelly jars. 
</P>
<P>
 This shop also holds Knott's famed jellies and preserves. Lesser-known 
products bearing the Knott's label are salad dressings, pickled things such as 
a cucumber and onion mix, and flavored honey (orange blossom, clover and 
buckwheat). 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 to 2: Heading around the building, toward Grand Avenue, you'll spot 
another shop marked "Souvenirs." This is actually the lower-brow half of 
Virginia's Gift Shop, and it's the more fun half. 
</P>
<P>
 I can never get enough of shops like this, and just a few steps inside the 
entry way reminds me why. Ceramic chickens, with "Knott's" painted on their 
sides, hold a set of measuring spoons that stick out from a hole where their 
tail feathers would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason to shop here is the Walter and Cordelia Knott memorial plate, 
with a photo of that famous founding couple. Finally, I spotted a refrigerator 
magnet in the shape of California with a valley quail superimposed over it. 
Very satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 The serious half of Virginia's Gift Shop opens onto Grand Avenue. It contains 
portraits of John Wayne, collectible dolls, tiny ceramic animals and dinner 
plate sets in tasteful country patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2:30: As you head up Grand Avenue, you'll pass Mrs. Knott's Chicken 
Dinner Restaurant, and, probably, a line of people waiting to get in. If you 
want to taste the food without the wait, continue on and turn in at Chicken to 
Go. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken to Go serves dinner combinations, much like Colonel Sanders. The Snack 
Box A, for example, holds two pieces of white meat chicken, mashed potatoes 
with gravy, cole slaw, biscuits and boysenberry jam. Delicious. The price is 
$4.75. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a kids meal, with Jello and a dinosaur cup, for $3.95; the 24-piece 
Bonanza Bucket is $26.95. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few tables on site, or you can walk across the street and sit on a 
bench in front of the moccasin shop. 
</P>
<P>
 2:30 to 3: A final stop, at the International MarketPlace store, takes 
shoppers from the American Southwest to Asia to Africa. The store is arranged 
by geographic area and contains mostly souvenir-type merchandise. The Pacific 
Isles section, for example, holds seashells, shell jewelry and shell wind 
chimes. Bon voyage. California Marketplace at Knott's Berry Farm

 IMMOVABLE OBJECT: With just two old Chevy Novas, Councilwoman Nancy Marthens 
has added new meaning to the term "gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 The cars had been parked in Marthens' driveway for years when someone finally 
complained to city administrators.Last summer they issued a citation ordering 
her to move the cars, deemed a legal nuisance because they were visible from 
the street. She refused. After a hearing, the order was reissued. Marthens 
wouldn't budge. Instead, she asked her fellow council members to rescind the 
order. The council tried last week and failed. So, it would seem the citation 
stands and Marthens must move her cars. She still refuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilwoman said she will block the view of the cars by building a 
six-foot fence. Marthens said the 1962 Chevy Novas may need fresh paint but 
they are classics, which she hopes one day to restore.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether the fence would satisfy city administrators remains to be seen. The 
city manager could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more important things to worry about," Marthens said. "I can't 
believe that of all the things going on in Lawndale, this is the most burning 
issue."

 RAISING THE FLAG: More than 200 light-pole banners, just like those used in 
the 1984 Olympics, will go up along main thoroughfares in Inglewood next week 
advertising the city's five main claims to fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The yellow-and-white nylon banners will have the business logos of Hollywood 
Park, the Great Western Forum, Inglewood Cemetery and Centinela and Daniel 
Freeman hospitals with the slogan, "City of Champions."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a mutual enhancement effort," said Assistant City Manager Norman 
Cravens. Partners for Progress, a consortium of the city and the five 
businesses, will pay $21,000 for the banners and city workers will install them 
along Prairie Avenue, the main route from the newly opened Century Freeway into 
the heart of the city.

 CRIME-FIGHTING CRUSADE: If City Manager William Kirchoff has his way, police 
officers won't be the only city employees fighting crime in this city. The 
library would add books to its collection about home and personal safety.The 
Public Works Department could supervise juvenile offenders in erasing remnants 
of their vandalism or graffiti. The Fire Department would be asked to develop 
ride-along programs for disadvantaged youths and train members to spot and 
report gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirchoff said he wants to make safety as synonymous with Redondo Beach as the 
Rose Parade is with Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked council members to create a Safer City Council to oversee the 
anti-crime effort. The group would include elected and appointed officials, as 
well as community members. "The police simply can't do it on their own, and the 
limits to professional crime-fighting have long been exceeded," Kirchhoff told 
the council Tuesday.

 BOOK 'EM: Just what is it about Torrance that attracts so many big bookstores? 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-square-mile city, perhaps better known for its oil refineries and 
shopping mall, has not one, but two Super Crown Books and two Bookstar 
bookstores.Now a fifth large bookstore is coming to town, and this one will be 
almost as big as the other four combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders Books and Music, just entering the Southern California market, plans 
to build a mammoth 36,000-square-foot store at the corner of Torrance Boulevard 
and Amie Avenue. It is expected to open this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be quite unique," said Keith Marks, a partner at Amsted 
California Partners in Century City, which is developing the site with New 
Center Co. of Farmington Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 He described the new store as a "cross between a library and a bookstore. They 
promote it as a place where the customer can come in and read a book." 
</P>
<P>
 Borders, a subsidiary of K mart Corp. in Ann Arbor, Mich., also would include 
an espresso bar, reading areas and music listening bays. 
</P>
<P>
 And in answer to the question "Why Torrance?" Amsted California Partners Vice 
President Gary Scott says there's no great mystery. "Torrance has a dense 
population, a wealthy population and an educated population." *

 NATURE CENTER: The Torrance City Council has taken the first step toward 
creating a natural history center at the Madrona Marsh wildlife preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 With a combination of wetlands and sandy dunes, the 42-acre marsh is home to 
dozens of animals and birds, including warblers, herons, egrets and 
hummingbirds.It was acquired by the city in 1986, after years of legal and 
financial wrangling, and is bordered by Sepulveda Boulevard on the south, Plaza 
del Amo on the north, Madrona Avenue on the west and Maple Avenue on the east.  
</P>
<P>
 The council recently appointed an 11-member committee of environmental 
advocates, community leaders and city officials to help oversee construction of 
the center, which is expected to have a laboratory, library, exhibit hall and 
meeting room. In 1992, county voters approved a measure that set aside $1.5 
million for construction of the center.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee will hold public hearings and make proposals to the council on 
how to spend the funds most effectively, said Mayor Katy Geissert.

VICE SQUAD ENTERS THE CASE; BUSINESS IS BRISK -- AS USUAL -- FOR THOSE WHO 
COUNT ON 'RESOLUTIONERS' AS CLIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMANTHA DUNN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jennifer Bettridge had only a few resolutions for the New Year: Run a mini 
marathon by February (she started training Jan. 2), finish a graduate degree 
from Cal State Long Beach and stop eating M&M candies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably a little overachieving, huh?" said the 28-year-old Redondo Beach 
resident. "It's going to be hard giving up M&Ms. I'm an addict." 
</P>
<P>
 For help and inspiration with that candy habit -- and the marathon training -- 
she hired a personal trainer. And she's not the only one turning to a 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how it works. Most businesses do their best in December, but for 
the fitness industry, that's the slowest month. January and February are our 
busiest," said Rick Egan, Bettridge's trainer and owner of Fitness One in 
Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The phones at The Advanced Healing Arts Center in Redondo are ringing too, 
said office manager Charise Anderson, as smokers look for help in kicking their 
habit. The center's acupuncture treatment is the first bold-faced listing in 
the phone book under "Smoker's Treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had two patients come in to quit smoking just this week," Anderson 
said. "Usually we get one or two a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly this crop of "resolutioners" is better informed about healthy 
living, South Bay experts say. But that doesn't mean they're better motivated 
to stick with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eleven years ago when I started this, customers were different," said Lelia 
Guilbert, owner and founder of Healthy Lifestyles weight control clinics, which 
is based in San Pedro. "They exercised less, they were beef eaters and, for the 
most part, only were aware of what were thought of as the four basic food 
groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Guilbert says people who sign up for the Healthy Lifestyles program are 
more aware of good eating habits and the role of exercise in weight loss. 
However, "awareness doesn't always make for better choices," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By June, most resolutioners have forgotten their best intentions, Guilbert 
said. "After that, they'll lose interest. They'll go on vacation, and . . . 
they'll forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Guilbert says all her new clients this January will be counseled on how 
balanced eating and exercise are a lifelong commitment. But, she adds, "Do you 
think they'll listen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Dean, an aerobics instructor at Gold's Gym in Redondo Beach who has been 
teaching exercise for nine years, says she also has noticed a difference in the 
New Year's resolution crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know that, unlike the '80s when it was 'no pain, no gain,' you can and 
should exercise moderately," Dean said. "People are putting two and two 
together and are eating cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
 So are they healthier from the get-go than in the '80s? "It's a little bit of 
both," Dean said. She believes that overall, her customers have a better 
attitude about keeping healthy, and that each year a higher percentage seem to 
stick to their New Year's resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying, 'This is something I can't just start and not finish,' " 
she said. "It's no longer socially acceptable just to sit on the couch and eat 
pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 But because customers are not new to the fitness game, Dean says increasingly 
they are quickly and easily bored, and many lose interest. That's why Dean 
varies her aerobics class routines. "I like to keep them guessing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovy Ebro, a clinical psychologist in Carson, says people are increasingly 
sophisticated about seeking treatment for what ails them, whether it be 
physical or emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a person has some education and orientation, they are often more willing 
to acknowledge something is harmful to them," Ebro said. "However, the more 
sophisticated they are and the more they know, the bigger their denial 
structure can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe they're just realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting older. I know myself better," said Redondo Beach resident Wendy 
Soderberg, who made no resolutions this year. "I never keep resolutions, and 
people are a little more relaxed than they were 10 years ago. I make a 
conscious effort to eat right and exercise, but if I want chocolate, I'm going 
to have it and not feel bad. People are just saying, 'Hey, you can only do what 
you do.' "

Q&A; CAPTAIN LEADS LENNOX THROUGH TOUGH TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMANTHA DUNN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputies from Lennox station, the oldest and one of the more embattled in the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, patrol from Marina del Rey inland to 
the Vermont Avenue area on the border of Watts. Last year in the Vermont area, 
one in every 30 of its 32,000 residents was assaulted. Lennox deputies make 
more than 600 arrests a month, handle more calls and are fired upon more than 
any others in the county -- in 1992 they were shot at 26 times. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately Lennox station has not made headlines for its crime-fighting. It 
has been in the news for the conduct of its deputies: 25 were suspended for 
drinking beer at a predawn party in Alondra Park while they were supposed to be 
on reserve duty for the Calibasas-Malibu wildfire. One of the deputies fired 
his gun into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Station commander Capt. Jack Scully, who took his post in 1992, recently spoke 
with The Times about the station. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been in the Sheriff's Department for 30 years, and you specifically 
requested this area if the command post ever became available. Why?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's something special at this station. In the Vermont area, more than 
60% of the people live below the poverty line. They deserve good service, and 
if you're poor and outside the loop you don't always get what everybody else 
gets. I like the people in this community; they appreciate what we can do for 
them. I get very few complaints, because I think we do a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the deputies who work here are special. For the most part, these deputies 
drive an average of 75 miles one-way to work. They live a long ways away -- in 
Palmdale, Lancaster, Riverside -- because they're young and they can't afford 
housing. Then, after driving a long way to get here, they work in the oldest 
station with the highest crime rate. We have older equipment, we don't get 
everything we ask for because of budget problems, and because of budget 
problems there have been no promotions, no transfers. Yet, they don't complain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The past couple of years have been tough for the Sheriff's Department, and 
for the Lennox station in particular, topped off by the Alondra Park incident. 
How has this affected the public's perception of how you do your job? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: With all the problems since Rodney King, police departments nationwide are 
feeling like they have taken a hell of a beating that they don't necessarily 
deserve. Our deputies feel it when they go home. In social contacts, other 
people look at them like, 'Do you all do what was done to Rodney King?' Then 
they worry about budget cuts, getting laid off. All those kinds of things 
affect morale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After the Alondra Park incident was reported, the deputies admitted their 
guilt and took their suspensions without the expected appeals. How is that 
indicative of the ethic here, and what did you do to build it? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: We are trying to rebuild this station. It's had pretty good morale, but 
what we need to do now is take the Alondra Park incident as a positive and say, 
"OK, we did something stupid." We all screw up, but not all of us admit to it. 
Challenge TRW, challenge some other private institution where there is some 
kind of misconduct to see if everybody says, "Yeah, I screwed up. Where do I 
get in line for my punishment?" We tell the truth. That's the ethic we have 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 I punished them severely -- most were suspended for 15 days and that is going 
to cost them a couple thousand dollars. The most severe discipline, for firing 
a gun into the ground, was for 30 days and that's going to cost him about 
$4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: No doubt some people would say that when an employee at TRW messes up at 
least he doesn't have a gun in his belt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: I am not trying to lessen what they did. We have three plaques downstairs 
honoring the memory of three deputies who were killed in the line of duty. 
"What do your actions do," I asked them, "to their memory and to the things 
that others here try to do?" A few of the deputies involved were problem types, 
but the majority of them were -- and are -- very good deputies who have 
embarrassed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, in all my 30-plus years, Lennox station has always been 
known as the best, or one of the best, sheriff's stations. I think after the 
thing in the park, every one of us wants to restore that reputation. I tell the 
deputies that what that means for them is that sense of pride, that wherever 
they go they can say, "I work Lennox station." We have to re-establish that 
great reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What can you do to build this? What's your command style? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a simple open-door policy. I came here in the fall of '92 and I told 
them what I want from them is officer safety. If someone died under my command, 
I am not sure I could stay on in the department. I'm not sure how I would 
handle it. I said, "If you do anything to take away from officer safety, I'll 
kick your butt up and down Vermont. I don't want you to do anything to 
embarrass yourself or get suspended or in any kind of trouble. Treat people 
decently. Treat each other decently. Live decently in the community. And, have 
fun doing all this." 
</P>
<P>
 I also said I would never lie to them, and I don't want them to lie to me. 
I've tried to let them know how good they are. They are much better than when I 
was a patrol deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How? Are they different? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: They are not that much different, but I think the training they get is much 
better, and the areas they work are much tougher. Five years ago we seized 600 
guns at this station. Last year we seized 1,200 guns, 600 from the Vermont 
area.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There's been a lot of attention paid to the idea of community-based 
policing, where law enforcement officers go into one area. Everybody gets to 
know them and they get to know everybody. But the problem with that is the 
possibility for law enforcement corruption -- police being paid to look the 
other way in their area. How do you keep the integrity of law enforcement? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think there is a problem with integrity. I think it is a good 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago in the Vermont area there were no organized sports activities 
like Little League because the gangs controlled the parks. So we began a 
program to take back the parks. We started a youth athletic league where we 
took deputies normally assigned to patrol to work with the youth teams. 
</P>
<P>
 From that, we have built a youth center at 119th and Vermont that opened one 
year after the riots. We use that as a base to work out of. We have just added 
a bike patrol to the area around Washington High School. The deputies get 
stopped all the time (by people) thanking them that the gangs are moving on. 
You're talking about a community where shots are fired every night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But how much of that kind of outreach can you do? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's tough. Because of budget cuts, I have 18 fewer people. When people 
retire, or go off work stressed, or decide they want to be a policeman in 
Idaho, I can't replace them. There are so many programs we want to do, but we 
don't have the bodies to fill them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you could have all the money and manpower you needed, what would be on 
your wish list? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: I would expand the bike patrols first, because they work. 
</P>
<P>
 They said last year that violent crime went down (in the Los Angeles area). 
Well, I don't think anyone in the county of Los Angeles feels safer. Just 
because we were better than the previous horrendous year doesn't mean the world 
is getting better. Our goal is to reduce the fear level, to help the woman who 
is afraid to walk from the bus stop to her home after work. Bike patrols can do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 When we first talked about doing this, I looked at the crime rates and said, 
"Whoa. I'm not going to put a deputy out there on a bike . What about getting 
shot at?" But the deputies came back to me with a whole program. Now they are 
out there, and they love the fact that they are dealing with people who are 
saying thanks.  
</P>
<P>
 I was going to put a new facility on that wish list, but I'm not sure the 
deputies even worry about that. We need more cars in certain areas. We have one 
car working the Lennox area at night. When you look at the crime here, that's 
tough for one car to be working (alone).

COUNCIL OKS PLAN TO EJECT ROWDY CRITICS FROM MEETINGS; POLITICS: RANCHO PALOS 
VERDES PANEL SAYS RULE WILL MAINTAIN AUDIENCE CONTROL IN PUBLIC FORUM. 
OPPONENTS CLAIM MEASURE VIOLATES CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Loud, boisterous or critical speakers could be ejected from Rancho Palos 
Verdes City Council meetings by any council member under a resolution given 
preliminary approval this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A council member could ask a speaker to sit down if comments are "personal, 
impertinent or slanderous" under the rule. If the request is ignored, a Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputy could be called to eject the speaker, and if 
the behavior persists, the speaker could be barred from meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure passed 3 to 2 Monday night. Councilwoman Marilyn Lyon and Mayor 
Steve Kuykendall voted against it. Kuykendall, who oversees the meetings, said 
he has the power to eject unruly members of the audience and can handle any 
problems that arise without the help of the council.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the new rule will take the burden off the mayor in 
maintaining control and will allow council members to discuss whether action 
should be taken against a speaker.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the council majority say the rule will help them maintain a polite, 
focused meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But several residents, including Bob Ciriello, president of the South Bay 
branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, argued that free speech is not 
limited to courteous exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may well include vehement, caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp 
attacks on government and public officials," said Ciriello, quoting a landmark 
U.S. Supreme Court case that grants the public greater freedom to criticize 
public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Lee Byrd said the council was not attempting to deprive people 
of their 1st Amendment right to free speech. However, he said, "I recognize 
some people get excited, and we don't want that to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 The rule also could be used to censure a fellow council member.  
</P>
<P>
 Byrd said other cities have laws governing conduct at council meetings. 
Similar rules passed in 1980 are read before Norwalk City Council meetings. A 
lawsuit was filed, but the court upheld that council's right to bar speakers 
from the rest of a meeting for "loud threats or impertinence."  
</P>
<P>
 Ciriello said the rule passed Monday was created to give the council more 
control over speakers who repeatedly criticize council members and city 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Lois Larue said council members have scared off audience members by 
raising their voices and criticizing their comments. "I'm furious at the way 
they have treated audience members," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Ferraro, who was appointed to the planning commission Monday, agreed 
that the council sometimes intimidates speakers, including her. "They can do 
what they want as far as voting for their convictions. Still, I have the right 
to speak without being treated with disrespect," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman John C. McTaggart compared the new rule to being thrown out of 
a courtroom for contempt of court.  
</P>
<P>
 "It means you have to consider your actions," said Byrd. "We will treat every 
person who testifies with politeness and respect, and we must see that they 
treat us the same."

PASTOR MOVES ON TO A NEW STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new act has taken the stage at one of the Redondo Beach's best-known 
nightclubs, and its leader is quick to say that there is no cover charge or ID 
check at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strand, which has showcased performers from George Carlin to George 
Clinton since it opened in 1986, is now the Sunday morning home of the 
Peninsula Christian Center, a congregation of about 100 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor John Prassas said preaching in a bar on Pacific Coast Highway is 
unusual, but it helps him create a more relaxed environment in which to 
worship. And, he adds, it has a great sound system for the church band. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the spirit of God shows up, it doesn't matter where you are," said Peter 
Xifo, a congregation member and Palos Verdes resident. "People who wouldn't 
feel comfortable in a traditional place may feel comfortable here. There's no 
pretense, no stained-glass windows or candles." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Prassas' congregation is drawn from the Lunada Bay Christian 
Fellowship in Palos Verdes Estates, where he served 6as associate pastor until 
the church closed last month. The pastor, Wayne Coombs, resigned to work full 
time with orphaned children. 
</P>
<P>
 Prassas, 34, who decided to start a new church rather than continue Lunada 
Bay, describes his ministry as a "biblical Christian church open to the 
ministry of Jesus."  
</P>
<P>
 He was driving past The Strand in late December when, on impulse, he 
approached the nightclub managers, who agreed to the plan. The church also 
rents an administrative office nearby on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Prassas said he hopes the church site will draw potential congregation members 
from the surrounding community who "may have had barriers to get close to 
Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Christ ". . . found himself in the 'wrong place.' Now, we're not out 
to do this for show. But it's a place people can easily find."  
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, he held his second service in The Strand, drawing about 70 
parishioners, generally dressed casually. The service opened with a song by the 
Worship Band, a seven-piece Christian rock group that includes Associate Pastor 
James Ledlie. 
</P>
<P>
 When the animated Prassas took over, his hands moved as fast as Scriptures 
flowed from his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "When two or three gather in Jesus' name, he is there," he told the 
congregation. Buoyed by cheers, he boomed: "Yes, my friends, Jesus is in the 
house."

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; INJURED MOBIL STRIKER SETTLES SUIT FOR $350,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Gardena-based security company has agreed to pay $350,000 to a Mobil Oil 
worker who was critically injured in March, 1988, when a guard drove a pickup 
truck into a line of striking employees at the Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Excel Security Services and Juan Canizales reached an out-of-court settlement 
Friday just before a trial was to begin in Torrance Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Canizales, who lives in Lynwood with his wife and three children, suffered 
head injuries when he was thrown onto the truck near the entrance to the Mobil 
refinery. He was in a coma for three days and hospitalized for nearly two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guard Onna Brown, who was 20 at the time, was convicted of assault 
with a deadly weapon -- his truck -- and sentenced to nine months in Los 
Angeles County Jail. He served 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Excel was hired by Mobil to provide extra security during a strike by Local 
1-547 of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown reportedly was not working when he drove to the refinery and spoke 
briefly with another guard. He then sped into the picket line, grazing one 
striker and hitting Canizales. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Brown had been taunted by some of the workers, but Canizales 
did not participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Canizales has kept his job as an equipment operator in the plant's fire and 
safety departments, a Mobil spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Excel could not be reached for comment.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EL SEGUNDO; AEROSPACE CORPORATION PLANS MORE LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Aerospace Corporation, an El Segundo-based research and development 
center, is preparing for another round of cutbacks, about two months after 85 
employees were laid off. Officials declined to speculate how many workers will 
be laid off from the federally funded center under the new Department of 
Defense budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that defense downsizing is continuing to erode our business 
base," wrote Aerospace President Pete Aldridge in a memo distributed to 
employees recently. "Additional belt-tightening measures will be required." 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace's funding this year is expected to be $360.44 million -- $49 million 
less than the nonprofit corporation received last year and $8 million less than 
it had budgeted this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The final amount will be negotiated in upcoming weeks with the El 
Segundo-based Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Aerospace's primary 
customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment at Aerospace is 3,600, down from 4,100 in 1989. About 160 people 
left in October under an early retirement program.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SAN PEDRO; SHERATON HOTEL SOLD TO INDONESIAN INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sheraton Los Angeles Harbor Hotel has been sold to a group of 
Indonesia-based investors who reportedly plan to continue operating the 
10-story hotel as a Sheraton franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which was finalized Dec. 31, ends weeks of speculation over the fate 
of the high rise, owned by the Beacon Street Hotel Assn., a partnership of 
several Los Angeles area investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Breslow, a partner in Beacon Street Hotel Assn., said the names of the 
new owners and the sale price will not be released because they are negotiating 
the purchase of another hotel in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 An offer of $11 million for the hotel from a Hong Kong firm fell through in 
December. A $15-million offer from Marymount Palos Verdes College, which wanted 
to use the building for a dormitory, was blocked by the Community Redevelopment 
Agency for fear it would interfere with tourism.  
</P>
<P>
 The new owners also have several four- and five-star hotels in Asia, Breslow 
said. The Sheraton in San Pedro is their first U.S. hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The 280-room hotel at 601 S. Palos Verdes Ave. cost $36 million to build and 
opened in June, 1990. The new owners will take over operations Feb. 1, Breslow 
said.

DEDICATION TO BE HELD FOR SCHOOL CLASSROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Center Street Elementary School in El Segundo will hold a ceremony Jan. 21 to 
dedicate six new portable classrooms -- made possible by the City Council's 
annual gift to the school district of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The prefabricated, air-conditioned classrooms allow the school to reduce the 
average size of its first- and second-grade classrooms from 30 to 25 students, 
Principal Kathy Koop said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new portable rooms will house a computer lab. "We had computers," 
Koop said, "but we had them crowded into a half of a classroom. Now, whole 
classes will be able to use the computers at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 To raise money to fill the lab with new Macintosh computers, the school will 
sponsor a 5-kilometer run Feb. 5.

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; CITY FIGHTS LAWSUIT IN UNFAIR HIRING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five months after the federal government filed a lawsuit charging the city 
with unfair hiring practices, the City Council agreed to dip into city reserves 
to fight the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-year investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice filed the 
lawsuit in July, charging that the city violated the federal Civil Rights Act 
by not taking proper measures to recruit and hire minority police officers and 
firefighters.The lawsuit also charges the city with creating a hostile work 
environment for black police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously last month to use $200,000 from a city 
reserve fund for legal costs through June. At that time the council will decide 
whether to authorize additional funds, officials said. The money will be taken 
from the city's litigation defense reserve fund of $230,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council feels strongly that this suit . . . is unjustified," said Mayor 
Katy Geissert. 
</P>
<P>
 An ethnic breakdown of the city's 147 firefighters was not available, but in 
July, the city's 236-member police force was 84.6% white, 8.1% Latino, 4.3% 
Asian, 1.7% American Indian and 1.3% black, police officials said. The 1990 
Census figures indicated a more diverse community: Slightly more than one-fifth 
of the city's 133,000 residents are Asian American, 10% are Latino and 1.7% are 
African American.

MULTICULTURAL MEDICINE; PATIENTS WANT DOCTORS AND NURSES WHO SPEAK THEIR 
LANGUAGE -- AND KNOW THEIR FEARS. HOSPITALS TRY TO KEEP PACE BY PROVIDING 
EVERYTHING FROM SUSHI AND SALSA TO CPR SEMINARS IN SPANISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Takehiko Kobayashi of Gardena underwent surgery in December at Torrance 
Memorial Medical Center, he was surprised to find that many nurses spoke his 
native Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, that makes a lot of difference," said Kobayashi, 58. "When you are 
sick, you're not in the mood to try to communicate things in a foreign 
language." 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by that same feeling, Lisa Torres of San Pedro scoured her health plan 
physicians' list for a Latino name. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband chose Dr. Andres Jimenez, a young family physician with 
ties to San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, and she turned to him last month when her 
6-month-old son, Rudy, fell sick with a stomach virus. Even though she and 
Jimenez communicated in English, she felt reassured that he understood her 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I'm prejudiced or anything. I just felt comfortable with a 
Latino physician," said Torres, 27, a local cable company employee. 
</P>
<P>
 This desire for a cultural common ground in medicine -- a nurse who speaks the 
same language, a doctor who understands one's heritage -- is helping forge 
changes at some hospitals in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In a medical world that can seem harsh and impersonal, even when patients and 
doctors speak the same tongue, new attention is being paid to the barriers that 
can be posed by language and culture. Such concerns helped create the hospital 
wing where Kobayashi recuperated, a wing that will formally open this month as 
the East-West Pavilion, the South Bay's first inpatient hospital unit designed 
for Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, nurses speak Japanese or Chinese, and meal trays have chopsticks, 
Japanese garnishes such as shredded cabbage or radish, and, of course, the 
traditional warm towels. Pavilion planners even designed a sushi assortment 
nicknamed "the Torrance pack" that contains tuna, shrimp, whitefish, eel and 
California roll.  
</P>
<P>
 This wing is perhaps the most ambitious example of how some local hospitals 
are retooling their services amid the sweeping demographic changes in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Asians accounted for nearly 10% of the patients treated at Torrance Memorial 
in 1991, up from 5% eight years earlier. Another 69% were white, 14% were 
Latino and 8% were black.  
</P>
<P>
 "The South Bay demographics have changed and are going to continue to change. 
That's what we're responding to," said Carlene Reuscher, senior vice president 
for patient services at the 340-bed nonprofit hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 She described the East-West Pavilion as a starting point and says the hospital 
is planning other changes, such as more materials in Spanish. "Our first desire 
is to meet (patients') needs better. Our second hope is that patients will 
prefer to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say this trend toward multiculturalism is simply good medicine; others 
call it good business sense. But since the South Bay's Asian and Latino 
communities have grown dramatically in recent years, other hospitals have begun 
trying to appeal to a more diverse patient market. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance is expanding a program that 
provides physicals for executives of Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The same hospital now sends new mothers home with a baby-care video in 
English, Spanish or Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Dishes such as fajitas , tacos and menudo were added last year to the patient 
menu at Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne, where the Latino 
community nearly doubled in the 1980s to account for more than 30% of the 
city's population. 
</P>
<P>
 And Inglewood's Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital and the Great Beginnings for 
Black Babies program are opening a clinic targeted at African American and 
Latino patients in a Hawthorne shopping mall this week. Those two groups 
comprised 68% of the hospital's patients in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say these changes are long overdue. One Latino doctor, for instance, said 
hospitals have ignored the Latino community too long in favor of patients 
considered more likely to have private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not always been a willingness on the part of the provider to treat 
(patients) on an equal basis," added Virginia Apodaca, regional manager of the 
Office for Civil Rights for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
"I'm seeing improvement now, because providers are taking steps to communicate 
with patients." 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, those steps are being taken because Los Angeles County has 
evolved into the Ellis Island of the late 20th Century, where residents come 
from 140 countries and read more than 50 foreign-language newspapers published 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Just four months ago, California created a new Office of Multicultural Health, 
explaining that the state's African Americans, Native Americans, Asians and 
Latinos experience a disproportionate share of disease, disability and early 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than humanitarianism is helping kindle this interest in patients from 
diverse cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 In the turbulent world of health-care economics, some hospitals have concluded 
that marketing to racial and ethnic groups makes economic sense -- and may be a 
key to their survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Badly bruised by the recession, a steep drop in patients and insurance 
changes, 60% of the regions's hospitals were in the red last year. Many are 
cutting staffs, discussing mergers or reassessing their marketing strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospitals can no longer be all things to all people, and so they are 
specializing," said David Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Torrance, home to the U.S. headquarters of Japanese-owned Honda and Toyota, 
the Asian population grew 113% between 1980 and 1990. Similar increases were 
recorded in the affluent cities of the Palos Verdes Peninsula.  
</P>
<P>
 The number of Latino residents, meanwhile, grew 134% in Inglewood and 91% in 
Hawthorne, meaning that more Spanish-speaking patients are being treated at 
hospitals such as Daniel Freeman and Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a field such as medicine, where good communication is paramount, 
language invariably becomes the first stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The infant girl was admitted recently to Daniel Freeman Memorial. Her father 
spoke little English, so pediatrics nurse Patricia De Jesus stepped in to quiz 
him in Spanish: Had the baby been irritable, lethargic, vomiting? 
</P>
<P>
 De Jesus became a key link in the baby's treatment for pneumonia, providing 
reports to the doctor, explaining to family members why the baby needed to stay 
another night at the hospital, why the antibiotics were stopped and started 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm able to relate to them, because I speak their language, and they're more 
at ease with me than an Anglo nurse," De Jesus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scenarios are commonplace in hospitals in Los Angeles County, where the 
1990 Census found that one in seven residents did not speak English at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to close communication gaps, a new state law effective in 1991 
requires acute-care hospitals to provide interpreters for patients who speak 
little or no English and whose language is spoken by at least 5% of the 
hospital or area population. 
</P>
<P>
 Most local hospitals subscribe to the AT&T Language Line, which provides 
over-the-phone interpreters in more than 140 languages. Many have also 
developed lists of bilingual staff members who can interpret when needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those lists provide a portrait of how diverse the hospital staffs have become. 
</P>
<P>
 The roster at Little Company of Mary, for example, shows employees speaking 32 
languages, from Arabic to Finnish, Mandarin, Thai, Urdu and Vietnamese. The 
Daniel Freeman roster lists 28. The most prevalent languages at both hospitals: 
Spanish and Tagalog. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts caution that medical interpretation is no easy task. A Van 
Nuys-based firm, Interpreting Services International Inc., has developed a 
program specifically for hospitals to screen and train employees to do 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 Language is not the only cultural barrier that can separate patients from 
hospital workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts caution that health-care workers need to be aware of cultural 
differences in such areas as medication, child care, the value of folk remedies 
and the emotion-laden issue of terminal illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you can tell someone where the bathroom is doesn't mean that you 
can tell a daughter that her father has a terminal case of cancer," said Jean 
Gilbert, an expert in ethnic medicine and a management researcher at Kaiser 
Permanente, Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 In certain Asian cultures, dying at home is considered far preferable to dying 
in a hospital, so a patient's family might fight hard to have their relative 
discharged before death, said Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's considered in very poor form in many cultures for a patient to be 
informed that they are dying," Gilbert said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser is preparing more programs to help its staff deal with cultural 
differences, and at least two South Bay hospitals, Torrance Memorial and Daniel 
Freeman, plan to offer training to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hospitals have taken cultural sensitivity a step further: designing a 
program for a specific niche, or ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Company of Mary led the way five years ago with its ningen dock project 
to provide annual physicals to executives of Japanese firms in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 The program grew 63% in 1992-93 and has outgrown its hospital quarters. It 
will move in the next few months to new offices in the Del Amo Diagnostic 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Company, a 374-bed nonprofit Catholic hospital, also started a Japanese 
help line, physician referral service and a Japanese menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Its chief rival, Torrance Memorial, took a different tack in designing an 
Asian program by enlisting the aid of Community Hospital of Gardena, a 58-bed 
for-profit facility where two-thirds of the patients in 1991 were Asian.  
</P>
<P>
 The Gardena hospital's small size has hindered its efforts to get managed-care 
contracts, said its president, Raymond N. Smith. So the two hospitals produced 
the East-West Pavilion in a 20-bed wing on Torrance Memorial's fifth floor. 
Community Hospital provides nursing services and management expertise.  
</P>
<P>
 That approach has its dissenters. "I find it very difficult to dedicate any 
one wing to one culture," said Ursula Durity, administrator at Memorial 
Hospital of Gardena. "I think we are multicultural, and we should be able to 
satisfy everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of the new pavilion hasten to explain that a Torrance Memorial 
patient of any ethnic group may choose to stay in the Asian wing, even if only 
because of a hankering for egg flower soup and steamed rice, and the same 
dishes can be ordered in other patient wings.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're very careful that a white, red-haired person from Ireland has the 
option of going into the East-West Pavilion," said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Lisa Torres scanned her physicians' list for a Latino name, she 
illustrated the crucial role that doctors play in hospitals' efforts to reach 
patients of diverse backgrounds. Torrance Memorial, for instance, hopes to 
attract a broad mix of physicians to its new Family Medicine Center.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want a balance of male and female physicians of many ethnicities that 
reflect the mix of the population in the community," said Sally Eberhard, 
hospital vice president of planning and marketing. And, the doctors presumably 
would refer patients to Torrance Memorial when they need hospital care.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the physicians at the Family Medicine Center are white, but a group of 
Asian doctors from Gardena will move in next month. So will a five-doctor group 
that includes two Latinos, one Chinese American and Dr. Rick Chavez, who is of 
Mexican and Japanese heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez praises Torrance Memorial for its efforts, but says most hospitals have 
been slow in addressing the needs of patients from different cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospitals in the past have viewed Hispanic patients as being poor and without 
insurance," Chavez said. What those hospitals failed to realize, he said, is 
that many Latinos are insured and make up a sizable portion of the work force. 
A survey of eight South Bay hospitals found all of them offering some materials 
in Spanish. Three hospitals advertise in Spanish, and four are making plans to 
add Spanish directional signs in their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial Hospital of Gardena has begun translating its patient menu into 
Spanish, and Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center plans to follow suit by February. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Company offers Lamaze, CPR and a Safe Kids U.S.A. course in Spanish. 
The Safe Kids, which has attracted nannies and housekeepers, is clearly pitched 
to the employers, using an advertisement in English that raises the stark 
question: "Your child starts choking while you're at work. Does your 
housekeeper really know what to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 The program was designed for nannies and child-care providers, teaching them 
skills such as accident prevention, earthquake and fire preparedness and first 
aid, said Sandra Jansen, director of Safe Kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I like about this program is that the Hispanic women who take this 
course leave feeling good about themselves," Jansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Little Company of Mary and its affiliate hospital, San Pedro Peninsula, 
are considering a program that might include Latino menus and food for patients 
as well as more materials translated into Spanish, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 For hospitals, the value of such ventures cannot be underestimated, some 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're interested in attracting patients and providing them the best 
service possible, making those changes -- having interpretation services, 
having staff that reflects the patient population, having appropriate diet 
available -- those are very important things," said Calvin Freeman, chief of 
the state's multicultural health office. 
</P>
<P>
 For some hospital employees, learning to serve new patients has been an 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 In the kitchen at Torrance Memorial, cooks are whipping up dishes such as egg 
flower soup and a cereal known as Okayu.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Japanese food had never appealed to food director Scott Freeman ("I 
was a meat-and-potatoes guy"), he has swiftly become a convert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it. I'm sold," he said. The one dish he has not embraced, however, is 
sushi. "That's because I'm letting my own culture get in the way." Cultural Mix

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: THIS PUB SPECIALIZES IN SAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after Kazuhiro Kono arrived in America, he noticed an article in The 
Times predicting that Japanese cuisine would be the next big food craze. So he 
apprenticed at Hama Sushi in Little Tokyo, one of the establishments featured 
in that 1978 article, to learn the trade. Eight years and a dozen restaurant 
jobs later, Kono opened his own place, Fukuhime, in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuhime is an ikaza-ya , a traditional Japanese pub serving a large variety 
of sakes. Something like a Spanish tapa bar, it offers 24 different sakes to 
accompany nearly 50 appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be a sense of intrigue as one enters Fukuhime through the strands of 
rope that dangle from the doorway. In the center of the softly lit room is a 
colorful tangle of marine artifacts, including hanging abalone shells and dried 
fish. The walls are a curious mixture: classical Japanese prints, Kirin beer 
posters and removable slats, written in Japanese calligraphy, listing the 
dishes the restaurant offers. (There's also a menu printed in English.) 
</P>
<P>
 A popular selection is yakitori ($2): two sticks of chicken, marinated in soy, 
ginger, garlic, sake and sugar, then grilled. Another good choice is the 
shimeji ($3.80), often called oyster mushrooms, which are simply cooked with 
soy sauce and butter. Chinese cabbage ($3.80) is sauteed with bacon and served 
with a light oyster sauce. Garlic lovers might try the green garlic sprout 
cooked with sliced beef ($3.80). 
</P>
<P>
 Complete dinners, which include miso soup and rice, are also available. For 
instance, a combination of beef teriyaki and shrimp tempura ($10.50).  
</P>
<P>
 For a more traditional Japanese taste, consider a dish billed as "stamina 
tofu" ($3.80), a purportedly energy-inducing concoction of fermented soybeans, 
sea urchins, and mashed yams mixed into broth and topped with a quail egg. 
Perhaps the Raiders should stock up on this before Sunday's big game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuhime is at 17905 S. Western Ave., Gardena. 324-7077. Open Monday through 
Friday 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., and 5:30 p.m. to midnight, Saturday and Sunday 
5:30 to 11 p.m.

<P>
 THE BIG QUESTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Will Pepperdine win its fourth consecutive regular season title? Will Loyola 
win a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Answers to these and other questions will begin to unfold Friday night when 
Loyola (1-10) meets St. Mary's (7-4) at Gersten Pavilion and Pepperdine (8-4) 
plays Santa Clara (7-5) at Firestone Fieldhouse in West Coast Conference 
basketball openers. The local teams switch opponents Saturday night. Tipoff for 
all games is 7:05. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola last won a WCC game last January against St. Mary's, 59-55, before 
ending the 1992-93 season with 10 consecutive defeats. The Lions' losing streak 
stretched to 19 games, the longest among NCAA Division I teams, before it beat 
Buffalo, 93-77, Friday night at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Loyola was unable to start a winning streak, losing at Oral Roberts, 
83-69, Monday night. Center Wyking Jones led the Lions with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pepperdine-Santa Clara game matches the WCC preseason favorites. In their 
last meeting, Santa Clara upset conference champion Pepperdine in the final of 
the WCC tournament to earn a berth in the NCAA tournament and keep the Waves 
from participating in March Madness. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. Wonder if Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury will bring that up Friday? ON A 
MISSION 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the area's top prep girls' basketball teams will meet when Bishop 
Montgomery visits St. Bernard in a Mission League game at 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard (15-2), ranked No. 1 in the Westside, features a dominating front 
court led by 6-foot-3 senior forward Olympia Scott, who has signed with 
Stanford. The defending State Division IV champions also feature 6-4 senior 
center Marte Alexander, who has signed with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings' only losses have come against Lynwood and Niddrie of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery (12-5), ranked third in the South Bay, is coming off a 56-42 
league defeat to powerful Alemany, expected to challenge St. Bernard for the 
Mission title. Guard Shelley Dungo, who scored 22 points against Alemany, leads 
the Knights. CHURNING OCEAN 
</P>
<P>
 If Friday's opener between Mira Costa and Beverly Hills was any indication, 
the Ocean League boys' basketball race should provide plenty of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa forward Phil Fonua, showing that football isn't his only sport, 
broke a tie with two free throws and grabbed a key rebound in the final minute 
of overtime to help the Mustangs turn back the visiting Normans, 60-57. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-2, 265-pound Fonua, an All-Southern Section defensive lineman on the 
Mustangs' Division VII champion football team, finished with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, coaches Glenn Marx of Mira Costa and Jason Newman of Beverly Hills 
said the down-to-the-wire game was a preview of things to come in the 
competitive league, although Culver City dominated Morningside, 96-67, in 
Friday's other opener. 
</P>
<P>
 In games Friday night, Ocean favorite Redondo travels to meet defending 
champion Morningside and Mira Costa plays at Culver City. Redondo defeated 
Morningside, 70-51, last month in the semifinals of the Pacific Shores 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Hawks, though, might be without 6-6 center Brian Hattingh, who 
sprained his left ankle last week in an 86-64 nonleague loss to Inglewood at 
Redondo. HOT SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Banning guard Jason Pickett and El Camino College forward Joe Zaletel continue 
to light up the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickett, the South Bay's leading prep scorer with close to a 30-point average, 
scored a game-high 36 Friday, including 15 in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't 
enough as Banning lost to Dorsey, 83-79, in a Southern Pacific Conference 
opener at Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaletel, a 6-7 sophomore from Torrance High, scored 40 points for the second 
time this season in El Camino's 100-75 victory over the Australian Junior 
national team last week. Zaletel is averaging close to 30 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaletel will lead the Warriors against Harbor in a South Coast Conference 
opener at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wanting to catch Pickett's act can take in Banning's conference game at 
4 p.m. Friday at Washington. TORO HONORED 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Paul, point guard for Cal State Dominguez Hills, was named California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. player of the week after helping the Toros (11-3) to 
a 2-0 conference start. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, a 6-1 junior from Gary, Ind., averaged 20.5 points in victories over Cal 
State San Bernardino, 66-57, Thursday and Cal Poly Pomona, 90-63, Saturday at 
Dominguez Hills. He scored 24 against Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11-3, the Toros have matched the starts of the last two Toro teams to win 
the CCAA championship. The 1980-81 team started 11-3 and went on to post a 20-5 
record and reach the round of 16 at the NCAA Division II tournament. The 
1986-87 Toros also started 11-3 before finishing 22-9 and losing to top-ranked 
Alaska-Anchorage in double overtime in the NCAA round of 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills goes on the road this week, facing Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 
(6-8, 0-1) tonight and Cal State Bakersfield (13-2, 1-0) Saturday night in CCAA 
games. Bakersfield, the defending Division II national champion, has won its 
last 11 games. NAME RECOGNITION 
</P>
<P>
 USC women's basketball players Tina Thompson and Lisa Leslie, former 
Morningside standouts, got their names in the news for different reasons last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, a freshman forward, led four Trojans in double figures with 12 
points in a 47-45 Pacific 10 Conference victory at Oregon on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, meanwhile, was accused by an Oregon State assistant of throwing "a 
blatant, premeditated and violent punch" at the Beavers' Kristina Lelas in a 
USC victory Jan. 6. Oregon State has asked the Pac 10 to review the incident. 
EIGHT BALL 
</P>
<P>
 Nine area players have been selected to Southern Section Eight-Man football 
teams by the Small Schools Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Chosen to the Large Schools Division team were running back Scooter Atkins and 
receiver Neil Thakur of Chadwick, and running back Marshean Cox and defensive 
back Ukeje Agu of South Bay Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Schools team included three players from division runner-up Masada 
-- running back Glenn Gates, defensive lineman Lewis Lachyrro and defensive 
back Reggie Williams -- along with receiver Ben Holt and defensive back Eugene 
Francis of Gateway Christian. THIS AND THAT 
</P>
<P>
 The Peninsula boys' soccer team has 11 shutouts through its first 18 games, 10 
with junior Brent Kuykendal in goal. The Panthers, ranked seventh in the 
Division I coaches' poll, improved to 13-4-2 Monday with a 1-0 nonleague 
victory over Mira Costa. . . . The second-ranked Peninsula girls, led by 
high-scoring forward Traci Arkenberg, started the week 16-1-2. Arkenberg had 32 
goals. . . . The San Pedro boys' basketball team was routed by defending State 
Division I champion Crenshaw, 124-36, in a Southern Pacific Conference opener 
Friday at Crenshaw. . . . Serra's basketball team is starting to turn things 
around after a slow start. The Cavaliers improved to 7-9 with an 89-43 victory 
over Bell-Jeff in a Camino Real League opener Friday. Rick Price led Serra with 
27 points, including three three-point shots. . . . The 1-2 punch of Neil 
Thakur and Todd Ammons carried Chadwick's basketball team to an 89-42 Prep 
League victory over host Webb. Thakur scored 24 points and Ammons 23 for the 
Dolphins (10-5, 2-0).

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: SWEETHEARTS OF THE RODEO; "RODEO WALTZ"; SUGAR HILL  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In commercial terms, the Sweethearts of the Rodeo could be seen as heading in 
the wrong direction. After establishing a track record on the country charts, 
the harmonizing sister duo of Kristine Arnold and Janis Gill has signed to the 
small, independent, folk/bluegrass label, Sugar Hill, at a time when mainstream 
country is booming. 
</P>
<P>
 The move pays off artistically, though, as the sisters exercise the freedom a 
small label grants to choose varied material from out-of-the-mainstream 
sources, and to render it with tradition-steeped directness and simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 But small label doesn't mean small potatoes in terms of hired help. The 
featured instrumentalist is Stuart Duncan, one of Nashville's top fiddlers. 
Duncan's forte is sweetness and lyricism, which makes him a perfect foil for 
the sisters' lovely close harmonies. Gill's husband, Vince, is now the big 
mainstream country star in the family, but here he is just the gittar-player, 
snapping out some excellent solos that recall the days when he was known for 
his bluegrass-inspired picking more than for his crooning. Sam Bush, one of the 
flashiest mandolin players around, shows he can handle a more circumscribed 
supporting role with taste and aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The material moves from old-line honky-tonk and country classics (a good, 
springy treatment of Johnny Cash's rockin' "Get Rhythm") to contributions from 
contemporary country songwriter Don Schlitz.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sweethearts also rope in some good ones from the rock and folk field. They 
cover Jesse Winchester's memorable convict-on-the-lam lament, "Brand New 
Tennessee Waltz," and the Gordon Lightfoot homecoming song "Steel Rail Blues" 
before closing the otherwise earthy record with an urgent reading of Robbie 
Robertson's epic-scale ballad of spiritual romance, "Broken Arrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally they go in for the utter schmaltz that clutters mainstream 
Nashville output: "Jenny Dreamed of Trains," by Vince Gill and the usually more 
hard-headed Guy Clark, is a treacly supernatural fantasy, while Schlitz's 
"Things Will Grow" trades in routine country sentiment about the sweetness and 
continuity of family life. Tolstoy wrote that all happy families are alike and 
therefore not the most fruitful ground for artistic endeavor; God knows country 
music is larded with too many sound-alike songs about the verities of home and 
hearth. The thing is, the Sweethearts handle the schmaltzy stuff so winsomely 
that you find yourself giving in to the sentimentality against your will.

FIRST AND GOAL; FLAG-FOOTBALL TOURNAMENTS ARE CATCHING ON BIG-TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's drawing close: Super Bowl Sunday, that holiest of days for American 
sports fans, the January afternoon when the faithful approach a state of 
oneness with their sofas. It is a feast day, of beer and pizza and chips 
consumed before the flickering altar of the television set. 
</P>
<P>
 Among televised sports, pro football might be considered the unrepentant couch 
potato's last sanctuary. Basketball fans can head to the court for a pickup 
game, tennis fans make court appearances of their own, bowling fans bowl while 
baseball fans can join softball leagues. Meanwhile, fans of the Mighty Ducks 
can take to the rink for the fast-rising sport of roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Football fans have fewer outlets. Other than tossing a Nerf ball around the 
living room, or hitting the street for a quick game of catch during the 
halftime show, most adults who watch football rarely get the chance to play. In 
no other U.S. sport are there so many spectators and so few participants (a 
fact borne out by statistics from the National Sporting Goods Assn. in Mt. 
Prospect, Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
 It's a situation that the National Football League is trying to remedy -- with 
some success, judging by the early results. As part of the build-up to last 
year's Super Bowl, the league launched Draw Play, two weekend flag football 
tournaments (in Woodland Hills and Mission Viejo) leading to a one-day playoff 
-- called NFL Experience -- in Pasadena, site of the Big Game. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament is back this year, rechristened Air-It-Out and expanded from an 
exclusively Southern California event to nine NFL markets across the country. 
The tournaments started in Green Bay, Wis., in August and wind up this weekend 
at UC Irvine, after having returned to Pierce College last week. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the number of teams competing in the tournament in Southern 
California has gone from about 215 teams per site to about 350. New cities have 
caught on quickly as well: Air-It-Out tournaments in Miami and Dallas drew 
about 500 teams each. 
</P>
<P>
 The response has "been beyond our expectations," said Don Garber, who oversees 
Air-It-Out as vice president for development of NFL Properties in New York. He 
says the tournament is a grass-roots attempt to increase interest in the game 
of football. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows fans to get a little closer to the game," Garber said. "The idea is 
to get these armchair quarterbacks out and give them the opportunity to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Price (who promotes the regional finals of the annual Hoop-It-Up 
three-on-three basketball tournament in Huntington Beach) oversees the Southern 
California Air-It-Out tournaments, and was the man in charge of coming up with 
the rules for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In flag football, the players wear long fabric ribbons on each hip. The ball 
carrier is downed when an opposing player pulls off one of the flags. Because 
it is safer than tackle football and can be played without expensive pads, flag 
football is popular as an intramural college sport and with some city 
recreation departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Most adult flag football teams use seven-person teams and employ blocking. 
Price wanted smaller teams and no contact. The game he devised is played on a 
field 60 yards long and 25 yards wide, with four people on the field for each 
team (each team is allowed one substitute). The 30-minute game (rules are 
printed on Page 13) emphasizes passing and plenty of scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real fun time more than anything," Price said. "The idea is to feel 
like John Elway, feel like Michael Irvin. We let your typical football fan get 
a touchdown, do a dance in the end zone and go back to work on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 Go back to work, it is hoped, without bumps and bruises or more serious 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can extend (to catch a pass) and not worry about getting hit," Price 
said. "We have a lot of guys playing who are over 40 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for entering this year's Air-It-Out tournament at UCI has passed, 
but the fast-paced event is open to spectators. Former football stars who want 
to relive past glories have another opportunity, however: a new flag football 
league that has adopted the Air-It-Out format. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente-based Fast Action Sports has held two seasons so far since the 
last Super Bowl, in Costa Mesa, Cerritos and Woodland Hills. Deadline for 
entering next season's play is Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Anderson is head of Fast Action Sports, which also sponsors a popular 
adult basketball league program in Orange County. He got involved in the flag 
football league after seeing the success of last year's Draw Play tournament. 
Football, he said, "is not a big participation sport, when you consider it's 
such a huge spectator sport. . . . Our idea is, get out and play. Participate." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Valois quarterbacks the team that won the Mission Viejo Draw Play 
tournament last year. His team -- the Chicoutimi Cucumbers (nickname of former 
Montreal Canadiens goalie Georges Vezina) -- will be back at UC Irvine this 
week, and has played in both seasons of the Fast Action Sports league so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great. It's like playing out in the streets when we were kids. 
'Everybody get open and I'll hit you at the curb, I'll hit you at the mailbox,' 
" Valois said. "It's competitive, but it's under control." 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old Irvine resident guesses that the mean age for the league is 28 
to 30, with a few players in their 40s (the minimum age is 21). One team has a 
48-year-old quarterback and a 56-year-old receiver, Anderson said. He can only 
remember two women who have played in his leagues so far, but added that 
because the game emphasizes speed and strategy over size, more women might give 
it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Garber: "It's a throwing game, that's why we call it Air-It-Out. The 
nature of the rules and the format stress fun and safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Charles, a player from Hawthorne, agreed: "Basically, it's a lot of 
passing. You've got to have at least average speed to compete, because you're 
running constantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles, who plays in the Cerritos league (his team is the Dawg Pound), played 
football in high school, but hasn't had much of an opportunity to compete since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play it in college, so I guess (the league) is a way for me to go 
out there and play out that dream," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 League seasons last eight games, followed by a playoff in which every team 
participates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a definite atmosphere when you get to the playoffs, an extra 
intensity," said Gerry Janecko of Torrance, who played in the Costa Mesa league 
last season. "There's a little bit of trash talking going on. It's a little 
like old times." 
</P>
<P>
 Janecko played football in high school, but hasn't played much since. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to find a flag football league out here," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Janecko likes the four-on-four format, although he said defenders are at a 
slight disadvantage (because they can't bump the receiver at the line of 
scrimmage) and he's not fond of the rule that forbids runbacks of 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than that, everybody's pretty happy with it," he said. "We're liking 
it. It's pretty addictive." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Maciel of Buena Park, who plays in Cerritos, plays on a team (the Bomb 
Squad) with two of his brothers. Because a quarterback is allowed only seven 
seconds to throw, the pace is always fast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a run and shoot sort of thing," he said. "It's hard to go 
deep all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Zielinski of Bellflower, who plays in the Costa Mesa league (on a team 
with three of his brothers), played intramural flag football in college and had 
a little trouble getting used to the no-contact rules of the new format. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he discovered, "it turns out to make the game a little cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
 Zielinski said each team usually scores four or five touchdowns in the 
30-minute game. It's a format that prizes strategy and playing experience as 
much as size or even speed, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun. It's set up really well for the recreational players. The 
fastest players and the biggest players aren't necessarily going to win." Heads 
Up! Air-It-Out Coming to O.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL-sponsored Air-It-Out tournament comes to the athletic fields at UC 
Irvine this weekend, Jan. 15 and 16, beginning each day at 9 a.m. and lasting 
until dusk. The team registration deadline has passed, but spectators can 
attend for free. Information: (310) 829-5226. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast Action Sports adult four-on-four flag football leagues hold games on 
Saturdays (game times vary). Leagues are held at sites in Costa Mesa, Cerritos 
and Woodland Hills. Team registration deadline for the next season is Feb. 1, 
with games beginning Feb. 12. Team fee is $250 for the season, plus $20 per 
game. Up to 10 players are allowed on team rosters. Information: (714) 
361-5000. Air-It-Out Rules

<P>
 This NFL-sponsored no-contact flag football tournament was called Draw Play 
when it was first held last year in Southern California. Now, it has spread to

SURFING / ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE: ROGUE WAVES WASH OUT ROAD TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on surf 
teams. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not all surfing safaris are filled with sunshine, glass and perfect breaks. 
Some can get a little hairy. A lot hairy, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hodges, a 30-year-old Laguna Beach surfer and Infinity surf shop owner, 
was with two other surfers last month off Todos Santos Island in Mexico when a 
25-foot wave thundered toward them and their 14-foot inflatable boat anchored 
in the impact zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The wave, a mean, gnarly low-tide devil that Hodges described as a rogue, 
flipped the boat and ripped away its anchor line. Hodges' friend, Barry 
Deffenbaugh of Huntington Beach, younger brother of pro surfer Jeff 
Deffenbaugh, was aboard filming with a video camera when the wave broke 30 to 
35 yards in front of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry just ditched the camera and hung on to the boat's cross bar and stayed 
with the boat as it went over," Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges, a friend of Rockin' Fig's, told us about that day, the wave, and 
subsequent incidents that kept them overnight on Todos Santos, about five miles 
off Ensenada. For Fig and me, it gave new meaning to the Mexican greeting, 
Bienvenidos.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig: Did you think you were gonna drown?  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Hodges said, "but you do think about survival when this 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 As a big-wave rider, Hodges has surfed Todos for seven years. It was 
Deffenbaugh's first time there, though their companion, Terry Senate, a 
38-year-old surfboard shaper, had ridden it before. 
</P>
<P>
 They had trailered the boat and its 40-horsepower outboard from Orange County 
to Ensenada. They knew Todos would be going off. But it was small . . . at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the backs of the waves, it went from five to 12 feet in less than four 
hours," Hodges said. "That would be 25-foot faces. The wave that flipped the 
boat was a good 25-footer." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as surfing, Hodges had to stay ahead of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I started with a 7-7 board and in 45 minutes, grabbed my 8-6 and in another 
two hours, grabbed my 9-0. I was pulling boards out of my boat like golf 
clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 As the surf grew, they were forced to move the boat out farther, anchoring it 
in the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to be sunset, and we wanted to take the last sets. Barry was in the 
boat with a video, and Terry took a wave in and was in the channel. I started 
paddling outside when I saw it, a rogue wave at low tide. It was a close-out 
all the way through the channel." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges got dredged while three successive huge waves pounded him and pushed 
him more than 100 yards shoreward. "Mostly, underwater," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They righted the boat. Deffenbaugh got into his wet suit, and they scrambled 
into the water searching for packs, surfboards, food and clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 They maneuvered the boat to the other side of the island, facing Ensenada. It 
was small relief. The worst was yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so big that day," Hodges said, "the leeward side was breaking with 
10-foot faces. I've never seen it so big. Another wave flipped (the boat) over 
again, and that's when we lost everything, except for our surfboards."  
</P>
<P>
 Stranded, they climbed ashore, knocked on the door of the island's lighthouse 
and asked for help.  
</P>
<P>
 "The lighthouse guy let us borrow some blankets. We spent the night, shivering 
. . . our surfboards beside us," Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
 They eventually got off the island by radioing a private fishing charter in 
the Port of Ensenada.  
</P>
<P>
 Will you go back?  
</P>
<P>
 "I just ordered a new engine on my credit card, and my boat will be repaired 
in two weeks. In another few months I'll be back out there. It was about $5,000 
for everything. Say, Fig, you wanna join us for our break-in trip?" 
</P>
<P>
 Let me pay up my life insurance first.  
</P>
<P>
 Forecast: Head-high waves expected Friday and Saturday at west and 
northwesterly breaks, predicts Surfline/Wavetrak. San Diego and Baja could be 
good.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: RIGHTEOUS BROTHERS; "ANTHOLOGY: 1962-1974" (1989); RHINO

 Since the Santa Ana-bred Righteous Brothers still pop up regularly at Bill 
Medley's nightclub in Fountain Valley, there's a tendency around here to 
discount their contributions to pop music. This excellent two-disc anthology 
makes that impossible.Deep-voiced Medley and his longtime partner with the 
soaring tenor, Bobby Hatfield, simply made some of the best pop records ever. 
Such Phil Spector-produced masterpieces as "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' " 
and "Unchained Melody" are here, of course. But lest you think Spector made 
this act, check out the pair's earlier recordings for the Moonglow label, 
produced by Medley and written by him or Hatfield. While not the towering 
examples of studio artistry that their Spector records would be, "Little Latin 
Lupe Lu," "My Babe" and "Try to Find Another Man" captured even more exuberant 
performances, perfectly showcasing their answer to the black R&B they grew up 
with, a style that led to the coining of the phrase "blue-eyed soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Material that followed their second, and last, No. 1 record, "(You're My) Soul 
and Inspiration," is highlighted by the 1966 gospel-flavored Top 20 hit "He" 
and Medley's post-breakup solo single from 1968, "Brown-Eyed Woman." Of course, 
their 1974 reunion hit "Rock and Roll Heaven," a sappy salute to dead rock 
stars, is included for historical purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who thinks Michael Bolton knows what soul singing is all about, 
give this a listen and be prepared to hold on to your socks. RANDY LEWIS
