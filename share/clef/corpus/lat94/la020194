EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; BOWL OFFERS A BREAK FOR QUAKE VICTIMS; 
RECREATION: FOR MANY AT RELIEF CENTERS, THE NFL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME PROVIDED A 
RESPITE FROM THEIR TRYING SITUATIONS. TV SETS ARE DONATED TO 29 SHELTERS FOR 
THE EVENT.

 For about three hours Sunday, dozens of victims of the Northridge earthquake 
put aside their worries about shattered homes, lost jobs and anxious relatives 
as they kicked back and enjoyed a less frightening form of violence: Super Bowl 
XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting in a FEMA line all week," said a drawn-looking Jeff Mandel, 
40, as he sat intently watching the game from his cot at a Red Cross shelter in 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot easier," said Mandel, whose North Hills apartment was condemned 
after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At 29 shelters throughout the city, people made homeless by the quake cheered 
the Buffalo Bills or the Dallas Cowboys, happy to see somebody other than 
themselves and their families get knocked around for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims watched the sports extravaganza on color TVs donated by Circuit 
City and the A. C. Green Foundation for Youth, set up by the former Lakers 
basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV delivery came just in time for J. B. Cash, 35, who has lived in the 
Canoga Park High School gymnasium since his Northridge apartment was wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That picture tube is messed up," he said, pointing to a dilapidated school TV 
set on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the distractions of a small army of news photographers taking shots 
from every conceivable angle, Cash seemed content to recline on a blue army cot 
and root for the Bills, who lost their fourth consecutive Super Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated on the floor before him were brothers Frank and David Mory, ages 13 and 
10, who, naturally, cheered for opposite sides. David was in Super Bowl heaven, 
carefully selecting potato chips from three different bags and occasionally 
digging into a bag of cheese puffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Mason Park in Chatsworth, Fernando Delao of Chatsworth held his 3-year-old 
son, Eric, and related how the game was a welcome distraction from the 
Northridge quake and another temblor he survived, the 1986 Mexico City quake, 
which killed 4,700 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I watch the game I forget about the earthquake and how I felt I would 
lose my life at that moment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for others, the Northridge earthquake and the massive destruction it 
caused took the exuberance out of the championship football game. Unlike their 
counterparts watching from their own homes, they enjoyed no booze, no cheering, 
no high fives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game keeps you busy from thinking about everything that's happened, but 
then you look around you and it all comes back," said Giovanni Pacheco, a 
16-year-old North Hills resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco spent last week at a shelter in Granada Hills, but his family has 
since moved back into their home. But Pacheco returned to the shelter to watch 
the game with a newfound friend, Inez Becker, with whom he spent much of the 
game smooching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buffalo is going down," said Pacheco, between kisses with Becker, who was too 
absorbed to talk. "Dallas is going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Clarence Nelson and his friend, Keith Louis, enjoyed themselves 
almost as much as they would have if they hadn't been knocked out of their 
Reseda apartments. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Budweiser truck got a flat on the way over here," joked Nelson, 42, who 
saw the game inside a Red Cross tent in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we need a case of beer," cracked Louis. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fallout from the Jan. 17 earthquake poses special hazards to individuals 
with respiratory problems, according to the American Lung Assn. Stress can 
trigger asthma attacks, particularly in children, and the dust particles in the 
air can aggravate respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and volunteers involved in cleanup may be exposed to ashes, dust and 
other particulates. The group suggests the following guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 * Individuals with lung or heart problems should avoid cleaning up where dust 
or soot is evident. 
</P>
<P>
 * When cleaning a dusty or sooty area, thoroughly wet the area before clean-up 
and wear a dust mask. 
</P>
<P>
 * If asbestos or other hazardous materials are present, do not attempt to 
clean the area. Only licensed individuals with training in asbestos removal 
should be involved. The Lung Assn. can provide a list of qualified asbestos 
contractors and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also developed programs to help people protect their lungs during the 
post-quake period. The group is providing referrals for respiratory care items 
and has a limited amount of funding to replace equipment for patients whose 
equipment was destroyed in the quake. Medical referrals are required for the 
program.

AL MARTINEZ: DOVE FEATHERS IN THE DUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suppose you gave a peace movement and nobody came? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the state we're in now that the Cold War is over and hardly anyone is 
worried about nuclear missiles falling from the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, there's that situation in Bosnia where children are dying in the 
snow, but since that doesn't threaten us directly we can accept a little, you 
know, hell-raising here and there. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone on this side of the old Iron Curtain cheered when the Berlin Wall 
came down and the Soviet Union fell apart. The threat of annihilation was 
suddenly as cold as yesterday's soup. But peace has its dark side, too. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, more than 100,000 defense and aerospace workers in L.A. County 
have lost their jobs because we don't need all those guns and fighter jets and 
missiles anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 And Yakov Smirnoff, the Russian immigrant who used to make a living poking fun 
at Communism, has had to retool his shtick to embrace in-law jokes. Is there 
anything sadder? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not saying peace is hell, but it comes close. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Jerry Rubin is looking for work. I know I said he was a publicity hound 
and I'd never mention his name again, but this is different. The guy has only 
$2 to his name and the wolf is at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember Rubin. He's our most visible peace activist. As director of 
L.A.'s Alliance for Survival, he was to international crisis what seismologist 
Lucy Jones is to earth tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever hawks rattled sabers, Rubin was on the tube waving dove feathers, and 
we cheered his efforts. But nobody's cheering anymore, and the dove feathers 
are lying useless in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The peace movement has been falling apart for about two years now, ever since 
the Soviet Union died, but it wasn't until last New Year's Eve that Rubin 
realized he had to find work. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 40 people showed up at the Alliance for Survival's annual peace party. In 
the past, as many as 300 came, paying $20 at the door for an evening of food 
and entertainment. It was the alliance's biggest fund-raiser of the year, and 
it flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good time and sang 'Auld Lang Syne,' but my heart was broken," Rubin 
said the other day. "No one came. It was over." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact was more than psychological. As full-time director of the alliance, 
Rubin took half of its profits from various events to support himself. His 
share amounted to about $6,000 a year; not enough to maintain a lifestyle of 
the rich and famous but, with a working wife, an adequate amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Year's Eve flop proved that no one is interested in peace movements 
anymore. But that was just one indication. Rubin has seen attendance at most 
alliance functions drop by 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's $2 left in my bank account," he said in a tone usually reserved for 
those announcing the horrors of war rather than the horrors of peace. "I had to 
sell bumper stickers on the beach to pay the phone bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Every peace group is suffering, Rubin says. "It's not just us. Staff members 
are being laid off, and there are no retirement benefits. The movement just 
isn't popular anymore. I've got to find a real job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's not going to be easy for a guy who's 50 and graying. Rubin has become a 
metaphor for the peace movement itself, growing older with limited options. 
</P>
<P>
 No one's going to care that he's worked 14 years on behalf of peace. Where do 
you put on a resume that you've gone to jail five times and fasted 15 times to 
help make everyone aware of the dangers of war? How do you measure the impact 
of marches and banners and buttons and bumper stickers? You don't get the Nobel 
Prize for being a little guy out there in a corner of the world waving dove 
feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at me," Rubin said disconsolately. "I'm a 50-year-old high school 
dropout with no skills. Well, actually, a high school kick-out. I don't type, I 
can't drive and I don't hear too well. Who's going to hire me?" 
</P>
<P>
 He's got a point. When I asked what kind of a job he was looking for, he 
wasn't even sure of that. He applied at some department stores, but was turned 
down. He'd rather not sell shoes anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to consult or maybe have his own talk show, but both possibilities 
seem remote. Whatever happens, he's going to stay with the alliance, probably 
on a weekend basis, and try to turn it toward the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace isn't a fad," he said. "It's a lifetime commitment. But I've got to 
eat." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure how you thank someone who once marched with crowds and now walks 
alone. I'm not sure how you say "you mattered." But if it's any consolation, 
Jerry Rubin, you did matter. Too bad that isn't enough to pay the rent.

LORENA BOBBITT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are hearing a lot of empty rhetoric about what the latest Bobbitt verdict 
really means ("Lorena Bobbitt Acquitted in Mutilation of Husband," Jan. 22). 
"Is it OK for women to cut off their husband's penis? Was it a feminist act?" 
What utter, bigoted nonsense! We didn't hear any such comments or posturing 
about the verdict in John Wayne Bobbitt's trial."Is it OK for a man to rape and 
batter his wife?" 
</P>
<P>
 I heard a lawyer, a woman, proclaim that all she had to do was leave. Easy for 
her to say. She had a prestigious legal career, money, full knowledge of the 
law and how to use the mighty power of the law to protect herself. These things 
are not commonly possessed by manicurists. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaming Lorena Bobbitt for her victimhood by saying she could just get out of 
the horrible situation she was living in by leaving her abusive husband is like 
saying that the abused and ghettoized poor victims of crime in our urban slums 
are really to blame for the high rate of murders, rapes, and robberies in their 
poverty-stricken neighborhoods because they obstinately refuse to move into the 
affluent suburbs. The jury heard all the evidence and couldn't find it in their 
hearts to convict her. They thought she was a little crazy. Isn't that enough? 
</P>
<P>
 J. L. PHILLIPS 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the amount of abuse Lorena Bobbitt was subjected to during her 
marriage, I'd say she mutilated her husband while in a state of temporary 
sanity.

 John Wayne Bobbitt was found innocent. Lorena Bobbitt was found not guilty. I

THEY ONLY HELP THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES; U.S. AID, YES, BUT THE STATE MUST BE 
WILLING TO TAX ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington continues to respond efficiently to the mounting challenges created 
by the Northridge earthquake. But the aid being delivered by the federal 
government is only the beginning for Southern California: Much more will be 
needed to rebuild a region that is crucial to the entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Shalala, President Clinton's health and human services secretary, is the 
latest Cabinet member to personally inspect the damage and announce federal 
assistance. She will make available $28 million more to help repair hospitals 
and government medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown is expected to come to Los Angeles this 
week to address the long-term recovery of businesses. That visit, too, is most 
welcome, for an economic recovery is critical to restoring jobs, goods, 
services and a sense of order. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is expected to seek at least $8.6 billion in aid -- 
and that figure might increase as damage estimates grow. Congress will soon 
take up a supplemental appropriation to help Los Angeles. To help speed that 
legislation into law, Gov. Pete Wilson should put more state money on the table 
in Sacramento. His initial request for 100% federal financing is unrealistic. 
He and the Legislature must be prepared to consider a temporary tax hike to 
help pay for rebuilding. If federal purse strings are to loosen again, 
Washington must see Californians as willing to do their part. 
</P>
<P>
 The need is enormous. Nearly 216,000 people applied for federal assistance, 
according to Richard Andrews, director of the California Office of Emergency 
Services, and thousands more are expected to apply before the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency folds up its disaster relief centers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of victims already have received government checks and vouchers to 
pay for temporary housing and other basic necessities and repairs. Another 
group that desperately needs help is the many individuals and families who were 
homeless before the earthquake; currently, they don't qualify for emergency 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 112,000 people had applied for emergency food stamps by Saturday. 
Sadly -- but predictably -- their ranks included more than a few fraudulent 
applicants. At the urging of the County Board of Supervisors, federal and 
county officials put in new safeguards to prevent abuse, including a computer 
system to track duplicate applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have lost no time in making arrests for aid-related fraud. 
Inspectors from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the food 
stamp program, and local police officers have arrested five people on charges 
of illegally buying food stamps from cash-hungry applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake, which has generated both heroism and greed, has 
proved to be no exception to the notion that tragedy brings out the best and 
worst in people. The 6.6-point temblor killed our neighbors, destroyed our 
homes, damaged our businesses and karate-chopped some freeways, and its 
seemingly endless aftershocks have frayed our nerves. But it did not shatter 
our resolve, and the surest way to prove that to the rest of the country is for 
Sacramento to rapidly ante up the tax money needed for rebuilding.

HOSOKAWA -- STILL STANDING; JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER EMERGES FROM A BRUTAL 
POLITICAL BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is still on course in his campaign to lead 
Japan into a new political era. His victory in securing significant political 
reform signals a changing Japan that may at long last put consumer interests 
ahead of Japan Inc. Should that shift occur, Tokyo will find it a popular and 
pragmatic move, and not just in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than five years of seemingly endless debate over political reform, 
Parliament finally passed a mild reform package last Saturday. It is short of 
the sweeping initiative Hosokawa sought at first, but it overhauls Japan's 
electoral system and puts some limits on political donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's reformist efforts extend well beyond these changes. His coalition 
government virtually has upended the traditional style of Japanese politics, 
back-room dealings and party alliances. Voters are being listened to, and the 
public prosecutor's office is aggressively rooting out corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Having achieved his first priority, political reform, Hosokawa now turns to 
economic problems at home and to stalemated U.S.-Japan trade talks. This week 
he is expected to unveil a long-delayed package of tax cuts and government 
spending, a major effort to stimulate the ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Will reformist Hosokawa make any difference in U.S.-Japan trade negotiations? 
In public, he has taken a less than conciliatory tone on the basic points of 
disagreement. But during his few months in office Japan has agreed to open its 
rice market to imports and to increase foreign access to public work projects. 
Both will benefit U.S. businesses. The next step is to push Japan's bureaucrats 
to reduce the $50-billion trade imbalance with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when Hosokawa arrives for his Feb. 11 meeting with President Clinton he 
must be bearing more than the traditional "gifts" of a tax cut and vague trade 
promises. That was pro forma for old Japan. His new Japan must deliver 
substantive commitments on trade.

EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As Mike Davis so correctly points out ("The Charade of Preparedness," 
Opinion, Jan. 23), planning for an earthquake or any other natural or man-made 
hazard has been too much under the control of developers, dependent and 
friendly politicians and the corporate bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, politicians allow self-regulation and compliance while reassuring 
the public that inspections and building codes will protect us from financial 
and personal harm. Buildings are allowed in areas that should never be built 
upon. Developers are allowed to do their own testing and write their own 
reports. The courts and the Legislature restrict and delay the ability of 
citizens to recover losses caused by poor planning and building decisions, 
fraud, and negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 More stringent building codes and penalties would be a step in the right 
direction, but the reality is that the financial and emotional investment we 
make in our homes and businesses is still dependent upon the will and backbone 
of people who seem to have other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 JEAN RUECKER 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 * My family moved to Northridge in 1963 and most of us still live there. Now 
that the immediate danger is over, we found that we all had a good cry from the 
loss of some of our favorite places and things that over the years we grew to 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 But I think that the true story of the Northridge earthquake is still to come. 
It was the massive response by our city government to the crises. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, we were impressed with the Department of Water and Power, the 
Gas Co., Caltrans, and the Building and Safety Department along with the troops 
of police, fire, and clean-up crews that are helping our area recover. My 
family would like to thank all of those people who worked so hard for us. 
</P>

 Northridge will soon tell us about many things that failed, from shoddy 
construction to poor design, but it may yet serve as the model of a city's 
rapid, efficient and coordinated response to an urban earthquake.

 * Yes, we want safe freeways -- but they aren't free, and they've never been 
partially safe, even without earthquakes. James Moore II ("Fix the Freeways 
Before Funding Trains," Commentary, Jan. 25) brings us the engineer's point of 
view about where to put our priorities and funding, but leaves out the human 
factor. Driving in Los Angeles is a negative, stressful and anti-social 
activity. It will only get worse in the future unless our leaders " . . . focus 
public resources for the greatest benefit of the greatest number of people" as 
Moore suggests, and dedicate funding to public mass transit systems (light 
rail, subways, electric buses.) 
</P>
<P>
 As the British Economist opinion (same page) says, we're at our best when we 
look forward. Public transportation, not private cars, is the best future for 
Los Angeles.

POLICING WATCH; STAYING POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officer Mona Ruiz of the Santa Ana Police Department has survived the gunfire, 
said no to drugs and faced down the scorn from two worlds. Her story, recently 
reported in The Times, is testimony to the sustaining power of a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former gang member pressured as a teen-ager to conform, she has had to 
will herself forward to a constructive life. Her presence on the department's 
gang unit, after leaving that world behind, gives special meaning to the idea 
of community policing.  
</P>
<P>
 The 380-member department has only 15 women officers, and of these only three 
are Latinas. Those numbers alone, unfortunately, are not surprising; the ratios 
are not dissimilar to those of many other police departments in the region. But 
more than the numbers it was the odds in life that were stacked against Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
 This 5-foot-3 mother of three went to work for the Police Department as a 
clerk when she was in high school. She had to deal with both suspicion from 
those she left behind and hostility from some on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory C. Brown, a criminal justice professor at Chapman University, himself 
an escapee from the world of gangs in Watts, says Ruiz is remarkable for having 
stayed; in moving up she did not also move out, to some other place. Isn't such 
dedication to one's roots what community-building is all about? 
</P>
<P>
 By bridging battle-scarred divides, by resolving that things would be 
different for herself and her children, Ruiz has become a role model for our 
time -- both an officer and a gentlewoman.

GO NATIONAL, OR GO BROKE; WHY GENUINE DISASTER INSURANCE CAN'T BE A 
CALIFORNIA-ONLY DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A number of legislators are eager to revive the short-lived California 
Residential Earthquake Recovery Fund, an insurance pool that was supposed to 
provide up to $15,000 in quake loss coverage to every homeowner, but which had 
to be liquidated as it teetered toward insolvency. The impulse to again offer 
some form of protection against major loss is understandable.But a limited, 
localized response falls well short of what's needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more preferable is an insurance program that would be both affordable and 
truly broad-based. Probably the best approach is through a national disaster 
insurance program. Legislation to that end has been drafted. Congress should 
move quickly to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Disaster Protection Act would offer incentives to states to adopt 
building codes to make new construction less vulnerable to earthquakes, 
hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters. It would give insurance 
companies incentives to offer coverage against quakes and other perils not 
usually included in basic homeowner policies. And it would create a federal 
reinsurance fund, to be financed by the insurance industry, to reduce the risks 
of insurance company insolvencies because of exceptionally large claims in 
natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Spreading the risk is essential to keeping premiums affordable. On Jan. 17 no 
more than 25% of California homeowners carried earthquake insurance, an 
indication either of a staggering degree of optimism or -- much more likely -- 
a pervasive feeling that high premium costs and large deductibles had simply 
put earthquake insurance out of reach. But natural disasters will ever be with 
us. There are sound and affordable ways to mitigate their economic 
consequences. A national program to protect against natural disasters seems 
clearly to be an idea whose time has come.

REGULATING DAY LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "A Case of Overkill" (Commentary, Jan. 25), regarding the county's pending 
employment solicitation ordinance, totally misrepresented both the issue and 
the Ladera Heights community. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladera Heights is a successfully integrated, upper-middle-class neighborhood 
situated south of Baldwin Hills, north of Inglewood, and east of Culver City. 
It is a community composed of professional people of all races and ethnic 
backgrounds who live together in harmony, and the extraordinarily low crime 
rate is due largely to neighbor looking after neighbor. The Ladera Heights 
Civic Assn. is the voice and advocate of the 3,500 families living here. 
</P>
<P>
 The day laborers do not reside in Ladera Heights -- they are trucked in, 
dropped off, and spend the day loitering about when they are not hired. The 
contractors who hire the day laborers do not reside in Ladera Heights, nor is 
their work in Ladera Heights. The contractors come here for one reason . . . 
this is the only Home Base store for miles around, and someone is providing an 
ample supply of day laborers.  
</P>
<P>
 As each day passes, large numbers of day laborers congregate around people's 
homes or small businesses waiting to be picked up. They drink, gamble, defecate 
in the bushes, fight among themselves, and make lewd remarks to passers-by. 
They threaten Ladera residents and once attacked the Home Base manager who no 
longer allows them on Home Base property. A Ladera church complained to the 
association that the day laborers obstruct its sidewalks and cause disturbances 
during funerals and other church functions. 
</P>
<P>
 The association tried the mediation services offered by the county but so far 
they have been a waste of time. It conducted an investigation of the measures 
adopted by several other cities, from the establishment of employment centers 
to the implementation of ordinances such as the one now proposed. The single 
most effective remedy to the problems caused by the day laborers in residential 
areas was the passing of these ordinances.  
</P>
<P>
 The county ordinance would be in effect only within 500 feet of a residential 
area, school, park, or church. It is a reasonable measure, yet the advocates 
oppose it, proposing instead that they establish, staff and run employment 
centers. Cannot the ordinance go into effect and the advocates establish 
employment centers in non-residential areas?  
</P>
<P>
 The advocates have a nasty habit of crying "Racism!" whenever they cannot 
prevail, but this time their charge is ludicrous, especially their claim of 
rising racial tensions in Ladera Heights. There is no racial tension, and this 
is not a racial issue. This is an issue of a community having its safety, 
property and peace violated, and it has a right, even an obligation, to seek 
protection for its residents.

 * I was angered to read that with unemployment rates in Southern California 
being one of the highest nationally, Supervisor Yvonne Burke seeks to pass 
legislation to outlaw casual labor solicitation. The proposed "seek a job, go 
to jail" ordinance is but another example of the criminalization of poverty by 
elected officials for political gain. Casual labor has historically been an 
entry point into the labor force for the unskilled and a last resort for 
workers displaced from other industries. Deprived of their right to seek an 
honest day's pay, these day laborers may turn to drug sales, robbery or other 
crimes to support their families.  
</P>
<P>
 An entire community of workers, businesses and taxpayers would benefit by 
allowing these day laborers to have a hiring hall rather than an arrest record.

INFLATION RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am appalled by the use of the word only to describe the 2.7% rate of 
inflation for 1993 (Jan. 14).  
</P>
<P>
 The only acceptable rate of inflation is zero! To put this into perspective, 
think of paying 10.95% sales tax for everything you buy in Los Angeles 
County.Can you imagine the uproar which would be created if a bureaucrat asked 
the voters to approve such a level? Yet the government can get away with a 
concealed insidious tax like this and newspapers are helping brainwash the 
public that it is reasonable and acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 This is also a tax on every dollar of savings put aside for the future. At 
this rate of inflation, every dollar saved will be worth 50 cents in 26.7 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 I beg of you not to assist the government in convincing us that anything over 
zero inflation is acceptable. This is nothing more than a hidden tax piled on 
top of our already horrendous load of taxes.

COLUMN LEFT/ HARRY BERNSTEIN: OLD GUARD WANTS TO SMITE THE REFORMER; TEAMSTERS' 
RON CAREY IS TARGETED BY LOW-LEVEL OFFICIALS RESENTFUL OF HIS CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN, Harry Bernstein was for many years The Times' labor writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Carey is under intense attack these days by those he battled two years ago 
to become president of the giant Teamsters Union. Carey helped clean out the 
mobsters, and is still battling old-guard leaders who tolerated mob dominance 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-supervised election that Carey won was held after the union's 
former leaders agreed to it to avoid prosecution on racketeering charges.  
</P>
<P>
 The union was crime-ridden for years. Its top officers supported anti-union 
presidential candidates Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush. They were 
accused of making sweetheart deals with some companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Carey, the progressive reformist, is in trouble. The union is spending 
more on everything from new organizing drives and higher strike benefits than 
it receives in dues from its 1.4 million members. One of Carey's foes estimates 
that nearly 70% of the entrenched, lower-level officers of the union oppose 
him, despite his clear victory when all members voted in the union's first-ever 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey has not been good news for anti-worker management, either. He and his 
allies have started waging highly visible, readily justified fights against 
reactionary companies. He backs strikes by personally joining picket lines and 
boldly proposed a dues increase -- first in a decade -- to keep paying $200 
weekly strike benefits (raised from $50) and push more reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey and his allies have initiated major, badly needed organizing campaigns 
to make up for the loss in recent years of nearly 500,000 members -- losses 
that came largely because of intense anti-union campaigns by management and the 
creation of thousands of small, non-union trucking companies made possible by 
trucking industry deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The reformists not only made a 180-degree turn in the union's national-level 
political stance by backing moderately liberal Democrat Bill Clinton, but they 
also are intensifying their fight for universal health care, labor-law reform 
and a broad, liberal legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most vicious attacks on Carey are coming from men like Alfonso 
D'Arco, a one-time member of the Luchese crime family who quit the mob and 
began talking to law-enforcement. D'Arco claimed that Carey himself had links 
to the underworld -- an unsubstantiated accusation that Carey calls "smut." 
</P>
<P>
 More important to his reputation is support from Michael H. Holland, a former 
general counsel of the United Mine Workers of America who was named by a tough 
federal judge to supervise the first referendum in the union's 89-year history 
-- one member, one vote. All past presidents were elected at tightly controlled 
conventions.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is simply no believable evidence that Carey is anything but the 
upstanding, honest trade unionist that I have found him to be," Holland told 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is still being supervised by a court-appointed independent review 
board that includes former FBI Director William H. Webster and a former federal 
judge, Frederick B. Lacey. The board itself says it has been given no credible 
evidence to support the claim that Carey is linked to the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
 Several long-time Teamsters officers say they don't believe that Carey was 
linked to gangsters. But he is facing different attacks from them and other 
lower-level Teamsters officers who tolerated mob leadership even though they 
themselves were clean and usually effective unionists at local and regional 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 They complain that Carey isn't an effective leader, appoints "outsiders" who 
have had no experience with their union to top posts and that he is now 
jeopardizing the union's future by calling for a nationwide membership 
referendum to boost union dues without first holding a convention. The 
convention could also pass resolutions undercutting him by taking away much of 
his authority as president. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey's plan to let all members vote on the increase is a daring risk -- like 
holding a nationwide referendum on whether voters want a tax increase. If the 
dues hike is defeated, the strike fund would be out of money by next June and 
the union's general treasury would run dry next year. The proposal is being 
denounced by Carey's foes, putting them in open rebellion against him. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a sad chapter for the union movement if the Teamsters' first-ever 
reformist president -- the first elected by a majority vote among all members 
instead of by delegates to those carefully managed union conventions that 
allowed mob domination for so many years -- is rejected.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE U.S./JAPAN RELATIONSHIP; PROMISES OF 'CHANGE' RING HOLLOW; 
ONE YEAR LATER, THERE'S BEEN LITTLE PROGRESS ON LOWERING THE TRADE GAP AND 
BREAKING DOWN IMPORT BARRIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLEN S. FUKUSHIMA, Glen S. Fukushima, an American business executive based 
in Tokyo, is vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. From 
1985 to 1990, he directed Japanese affairs at the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The relationship between the United States and Japan is in serious disrepair. 
Japan's huge account surplus, low level of manufactured imports, minuscule 
inward foreign direct investment and barriers to foreign products and services 
persist unabated. Why has there been so little progress despite the 
inauguration last year in both nations of governments espousing "change"? The 
answer is inattention, complacency and missed opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Inattention to the relationship has been abetted by a sense of complacency in 
both countries. In the United States, this complacency has three sources. 
</P>
<P>
 First, exaggerated media accounts have misled Americans into believing that 
"the Japanese sun has set." Although the current recession has lasted longer 
than expected, the fundamental strengths of the Japanese economy remain intact. 
Within 12 to 18 months, the cost-cutting, rationalization and restructuring to 
squeeze out the excesses of the "bubble economy" of the late 1980s and early 
'90s will have had their effect, and Japan will again emerge as a formidable 
competitor. Americans should substitute wishful thinking with objective and 
realistic analyses of long-term Japanese global economic strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Second is the mistaken notion that the "reforms" advocated by Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa -- and passed by the Diet on Saturday after being rejected by 
the Upper House on Jan. 21 -- would benefit not only Japan but also its trading 
partners, in particular the United States. This fallacy was premised on the 
assumption that the realignment of political parties in Japan would 
automatically lead to a more open, transparent, consumer-oriented society.  
</P>
<P>
 Third, the Clinton Administration appears to believe that asymmetries in the 
economic relationship can be remedied simply by asking Japan to commit to 
"results" -- whether in its current-account surplus, aggregate level of 
manufactured imports or sector-specific imports. There is an evident lack of 
appreciation of the profound complexities and difficulties facing foreign firms 
attempting to export to or invest in Japan and the attention, expertise and 
resources necessary on the part of the U.S. government and corporations to 
penetrate the multilayered and deeply rooted barriers posed by the Japanese 
market. The Administration also lacks an understanding of where, when and how 
much pressure should be applied for maximum results and minimal Japanese 
resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Japanese side, complacency stems from the perception that the United 
States is too preoccupied with its own domestic problems and with 
foreign-policy crises to worry much about Japan. There is also a sense that the 
United States is increasingly dependent on Japan's goodwill and support -- 
whether for "strategic alliances" between corporations, security cooperation as 
on the Korean peninsula, personnel for peacekeeping operations as in Cambodia 
or for financial assistance as in Russia and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 As for opportunity, the Clinton Administration missed a golden one in early 
1993 to set a fundamentally new course for the U.S.-Japan relationship. 
Japanese officials and business leaders fully expected the new Administration 
to institute policies that would force Japan to accept more U.S. products, 
services and investment in return for continued access to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhetoric coming from the Clinton team certainly gave that impression. By 
calling for "results," "targets" and "objective indicators," the Administration 
put Japan on notice that, unlike the Republicans, it would not settle for mere 
changes in procurement rules or procedures. But the flaw was threefold. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the rhetoric was not supported by a clear, coherent, consistent policy 
toward Japan. Depending on the day and the official being quoted, the request 
or "demand" was described as targets, goals, results, objective criteria, 
quantitative indicators, qualitative indicators, benchmarks, yardsticks, 
reciprocity, transparency or none of the above. The clear impression left in 
Japan was that the Administration was wavering. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the Administration's inattention early on allowed Japan to undertake a 
remarkably successful public-relations campaign that depicted the United States 
as a "protectionist" nation advocating "managed trade." Southeast Asian 
countries and many members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development were persuaded by Japan that if the United States were successful 
in pursuing a results-oriented trade policy toward it, they, too, would face 
similar pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the U.S. rhetoric was not backed up by action. The Administration 
failed to understand the cardinal principle in negotiating with Japan: Speak 
softly and carry a big stick. Instead, the Administration did the opposite; it 
cried wolf repeatedly but took no action. From Tokyo's perspective, the 
construction scandal was a test of whether the Clinton team would act 
differently from the Reagan and Bush teams. With more than 30 senior Japanese 
government officials and executives arrested in 1993 for bid-rigging, bribery 
and collusion in the construction industry, many Japanese knew that if there 
was ever a clear case of illegal activity that excluded competitive foreign 
companies from the Japanese market, this was it. Inaction by the Clinton 
Administration was seen in Japan not as a gesture of generosity but as a sign 
of weakness.

IS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES OBSOLETE?; EDUCATION: THE DISCIPLINE MUST 
INCORPORATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO PREPARE STUDENTS TO COMPETE IN THE 21ST 
CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KWAKU PERSON-LYNN, Kwaku Person-Lynn teaches African American studies at Cal 
State University, Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While teaching a course in African American studies, I had a student who was a 
math major. She was taking calculus and physics and feeling a little 
overwhelmed, as most students do at some point, said, "Dr. Kwaku, I'm tired of 
math. It's so hard. I'm going to change my major to African American studies." 
Needless to say, I had a long talk with her about the importance of staying in 
math, for all the right reasons. Somehow, I felt my words were going in one ear 
and out the other until I saw her the following semester. 
</P>
<P>
 One day while walking across campus, she approached me and said, "Dr. Kwaku, I 
was thinking of changing my major, but after taking your class and finding out 
that my African ancestors created mathematics and used it to build the 
pyramids, I am going to stick with it until I finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Every semester, while teaching African American courses, I get complaints from 
students who take a science survey course that they never hear about African 
and African American scientists and their achievements, but learn all about 
European and EuroAmerican scientists. When they ask the instructor about this, 
they say he tells them "that if we want to learn anything about those people in 
science, we can do something for extra credit." 
</P>
<P>
 When I cover the topic of African and African American scientists, inventors, 
creations and so forth, it is as if a whole new world of information has been 
dropped on these students. It is amazing that they had to wait for college to 
learn it. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not that we just hear about a select few African and African 
American scientists; it is also time for African American studies to take a 
giant step into science and technology. It is of utmost importance to study 
African American history, literature and music, which primarily deal with the 
past and contribute heavily to a balance of acquired knowledge and 
consciousness. But it is now time to also deal with the future. If we do not 
step into the hard sciences and mathematics, building a nation within a nation, 
some enterprising filmmaker will be making a black "Jurassic Park," featuring 
those who can't do anything but develop another "Wild Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
 It is understood that struggle plays a role in this process. There are those 
who fought hard to get positions and programs in African American studies and 
were the innovators for all so-called ethnic-studies programs. It is also 
understood that there are those who develop little fiefdoms to protect their 
positions and are afraid to venture outside of their body of knowledge. The 
issue is not to eliminate anything or anyone, but to add another dimension that 
will allow a thorough survey of the scientific achievements of the African and 
African American world: teaching courses that clearly illustrate how to 
motivate and stimulate young children into math and science; developing 
incentives and prizes for scientific achievement in the community that will 
help to eliminate some of the negative elements; using the high-tech 
public-relations tools to elevate scientists as equals to movie stars, athletes 
and rap stars and, most of all, doubling and tripling math and science majors. 
</P>
<P>
 African American studies must be the catalyst for bringing about this change. 
Students will be taking SATs and GREs and filling out employment applications 
on computers. No African American student should be allowed to graduate without 
some level of computer competency. 
</P>
<P>
 No one should wait for society, the government, academia or anything else to 
emphasize the future. If the leaders in African American studies are not 
willing to make the next move to ensure the survival of the community, the 
preparedness of its growing work force and the strong emphasis on the tools 
needed to guarantee a future, African American studies won't be the only thing 
that becomes obsolete.

GELINAS PROVES TO BE BARGAIN AS CANUCKS BEAT KINGS, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You certainly have to do some selective shopping when it comes to the waiver 
wire. Mostly, you rummage through the rabble. Very few players who go through 
waivers are worth bothering to make an effort to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's left wing Martin Gelinas, who scored twice in Vancouver's 3-1 
victory over the Kings on Monday before 16,040 at Pacific Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a young guy, 23, who already acquired a Stanley Cup ring when he was with 
the Edmonton Oilers. And he's not some high-priced aging veteran. Gelinas makes 
a palatable $300,000 (Canadian). 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver General Manager and Coach Pat Quinn claimed Gelinas on waivers from 
Quebec on Jan. 15, and Gelinas made his move look superb Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings (19-25-6) remain in an eighth-place tie with the Mighty Ducks for 
the final playoff spot in the Western Conference and slipped eight points 
behind the Canucks in the Pacific Division. The Kings have won only once in 
their last seven games, going 1-4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings things back to Gelinas. Since the Kings are searching for more 
depth and extra offense outside of Wayne Gretzky, Luc Robitaille and Jari 
Kurri, it might have been interesting if they had claimed Gelinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly they had a chance. The Canucks, by virtue of their better record, 
picked him up after the Kings turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good player," King Coach Barry Melrose said. "Vancouver was very smart 
in picking him up. I always liked him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings were drastically undermanned Monday. Robitaille missed his first 
game since Nov. 27, 1990, because of a sprained right ankle, suffered on 
Saturday against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Tony Granato had a flare-up of back spasms during Monday's morning 
skate. Left wing Warren Rychel also sat out, serving a one-game suspension for 
having accumulated three game misconducts. 
</P>
<P>
 Right wing Dave Taylor was back home after a recurrence of headaches and 
forward Gary Shuchuk will miss six weeks because of a sprained left knee. So 
the Kings called up Keith Redmond from Phoenix, and defenseman Brent Thompson 
moved to wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings were also worn down by constant penalty killing, shutting down 
Vancouver, which went 0 for eight. Also not helping the mood were the postgame 
antics of Canuck forward Gino Odjick, who went after Gretzky after the final 
buzzer. Odjick was assessed a 10-minute misconduct and Gretzky wound up with a 
sore neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's ridiculous," King defenseman Darryl Sydor said. "He's done that 
every game now." 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The long saga of Wayne Gretzky's new three-year, $25.5 million contract 
appears to be drawing to a close. He agreed in principle about four months ago 
but has not signed the deal yet. Several times, it seemed as the transaction 
was almost completed. "You have to file everything with the league now," 
Gretzky said on Monday. "And with new ownership, they have to agree on 
everything. It's made it more complicated. But everybody understands it will 
get done." Presumably, Gretzky will sign the contract when he returns to Los 
Angeles after this two-game trip. Among the various issues prolonging the 
transaction was the NHL vetoing a no-trade clause and the specific legal 
language dealing with the deferred payments from Gretzky's previous contract. 
The final issues were discussed in a 2 1/2-hour meeting on Monday between King 
owner Bruce McNall, soon-to-be owners Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joe Cohen, Gretzky's 
agent Michael Barnett and Gretzky's lawyer Ron Fujikawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings on Monday fired Tim Bothwell, the coach of their minor league team 
in Phoenix and replaced him with Rick Dudley. Bothwell had coached the 
struggling Roadrunners for two seasons. His record was 26-50-6 last season and 
19-26-2 this season.

WITH AGUIRRE SENT PACKING, CLIPPERS ARE LACKING IN LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers could have used forward Mark Aguirre in Monday night's 110-96 
loss to the Golden State Warriors before 9,281 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aguirre, who provided instant offense as a reserve, was released before 
the game to make room for forward John Williams, who is expected to be 
activated soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clipper offense seemed flat without Aguirre, the ninth-best three-point 
shooter in the NBA this season, as they fell behind by 17 points at halftime. 
Fans who were seated behind the Clipper bench, apparently unaware that Aguirre 
had been released, called for him, but he was home preparing to move his family 
to Dallas, where he owns a business. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the Clippers have used Aguirre? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a non-issue at this point," Clipper forward Danny Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior guard Latrell Sprewell made four three-point shots en route to a 
game-high 32 points, 20 in the first quarter. Chris Webber had 20 points and 
five rebounds as the Warriors (23-18) ended a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who ended the first half of the season with a 15-26 record, 
compared to 22-19 at the midway point of last season, had to play the final 
2:58 without Manning, who scored 18 points before he was ejected for arguing 
with referee Ted Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, who received a double technical foul, was tackled by rookie guard 
Harold Ellis to prevent him from going after Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he read my mind," Manning said of the official. "I didn't say 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to assess the first half of the season, Clipper guard Mark Jackson said, 
"We're not as good a team (as last season). We're as good potentially, but not 
as good when we get out on the floor. We're just too inconsistent. With a good 
team, you know that every night you're going to get effort and every night 
you're going to be in the ballgame, and we just don't know sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, who had been averaging 10.6 points in 22 minutes this season, was 
informed of his release by phone Monday. He cleaned out his locker before the 
game and was gone by the time his teammates arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, 34, who said last week that he planned to retire at the end of the 
season, was waived by the Clippers to make room for Williams, who returned to 
the team after spending the last four months at a weight-reduction center at 
Duke University. Williams is still suspended without pay, but he could be 
activated for Saturday's game against Sacramento at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "John coming back is in the very near future, and his minutes are going to 
come from Mark Aguirre's minutes," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said. "When I 
brought Mark here, I told him it was to play. I didn't think he was getting 
enough minutes to be as happy as he wanted to be, as things were. It was only 
going to get worse. I didn't want Mark as the 10th, 11th or 12th man. It's 
better for Mark to be able to go somewhere else and better for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The move caught Aguirre by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't understand the reason," Aguirre said. "They talked to me today. 
They felt like there weren't going to be enough minutes (for him and Williams). 
They made a business decision. I'd just gotten comfortable with the guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, in his 13th NBA season, said he probably won't try to catch on with 
another team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even thought about that yet," Aguirre said.

ANALYSIS; COMMERCIALS DON'T MEASURE UP TO HYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERKOWITZ, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's because they long for the '60s, or perhaps they just prefer folk 
and rock to rap music, but an assortment of advertising executives Monday chose 
Pepsi's "Woodstock Reunion" spot as their favorite Super Bowl commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 In reviewing more than three dozen Super Bowl spots, six of the eight ad 
critics interviewed for this article chose the Woodstock spot, by ad agency 
BBDO, as one of the best. The ad includes kids who look on at the reminiscing 
adults and express hope that they won't skinny-dip again. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the critics, saying they may have been influenced by the recent cold 
weather, chose two sensuous and understated spots for Norwegian Cruise Line by 
Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein as among their favorites, although some questioned 
whether they were too soft-sell for the Super Bowl. "I would consider taking 
the cruise," said critic Ted Littleford, executive creative director at 
FCB/Leber Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the critics expressed dismay that, just like the Super Bowl itself, 
it's become very difficult for the ads to live up to expectations for the 
highly showcased event. They cited a Frito-Lay potato chips spot featuring 
former Vice President Dan Quayle as falling short of the advance hype. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just amazing to me how much money is blown on celebrities and 
extravagant productions," said Bill Oberlander, creative director at 
Kirshenbaum & Bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program was full of spots that tried so hard that they ended up looking 
desperate," said Brian Sitts, senior vice president and group creative director 
at J. Walter Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, he cited the sixth annual Bud Bowl with once dazzling computer 
animation that "has become ho-hum today." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the critics said a spot in which Cindy Crawford turns into Rodney 
Dangerfield after being deprived of Pepsi was overproduced and predictable. 
They also gave mediocre marks to a Pepsi spot starring taste-testing chimps, 
even though the ad got a record high score in a USA Today poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The execs split on two Nike ads starring Steve Martin that asked whether 
Michael Jordan had faked retirement. Some said the comedian was wasted; others 
said the spot was very entertaining. They also split on a Doritos Tortilla 
Thins ad in which Chevy Chase is fired and on Chrysler spots introducing the 
Neon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics said the use of a rapping and dunking Shaquille O'Neal for Reebok 
did not work. "The Reebok spot was pretty mind-numbing," said Julie 
Newton-Cucchi, creative director at Ogilvy & Mather. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad execs said that even if an ad works in normal programming, it may be 
wasted in an event that charges advertisers a whopping $900,000 per 30 seconds 
and that plays to a largely partying crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those advertisers that don't do commercials that are significant enough to 
get pre- or post-PR out of it are really wasting money," said Ron Berger of 
Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer. 
</P>
<P>
 As examples, the critics cited spots for Ray-O-Vac batteries that were heavy 
on graphics but short on entertainment, and a Goodyear spot with cars tugging 
water skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some spots went on too long, the critics said, citing a 90-second spot for 
Alamo rental cars, when a couple takes a 4-million-mile trip. "It went on so 
long I ended up feeling sorry for the family," Sitts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other spots have overextended their themes, critics said. A McDonald's spot 
last year that pitted Jordan against Larry Bird in a whimsical basketball 
showdown was warmly received, but the sequel stretching to outer space and 
adding Charles Barkley was not as popular. "The idea is tired," said Brent 
Bouchez, senior vice president at Ammirati & Puris. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, some critics said the use of basketball star Larry Johnson as 
"Grandmama" for Converse has grown tired, even with Wizard of Oz imagery. And 
7-Up ads using animated spots to wipe away the color of cola were not helped by 
the additions of humans in a casino, several critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ads were entertaining but seemed to have little to do with the product, 
said Jay Schulberg, vice chairman at Bozell. A few critics cited a Lipton Iced 
Tea spot that was a spoof of Kung Fu with David Carradine and The Three Stooges 
as looking more like a cola commercial, while others said it was clever. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, critics were impressed by a Reebok Insta-Pump spot with Emmitt 
Smith that looked almost like part of the game. Said Carmon Johnston, broadcast 
production director at Uniworld Group, "The star of the show was the Reebok ad 
that used actual highlight footage to cut a commercial live."

GILLOOLY RESENTED SYSTEM; FIGURE SKATING: SUSPICION OF FAVORITISM TOWARD 
KERRIGAN BY THE SPORT'S ESTABLISHMENT MAY HAVE SPAWNED ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brooding suspicions about the objectivity of judges and the fairness of 
scoring in women's figure skating may have motivated the attack on Nancy 
Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding's ex-husband is scheduled to appear in county court today amid 
signs he will plead guilty in the assault and, perhaps, flesh out for the first 
time his version of exactlywhat gave cause to the violent attempt to rig the 
1994 national women's figure skating championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say that Jeff Gillooly believed that his on-again, off-again spouse 
had been given a raw deal by skating judges, and that rival Kerrigan was 
plainly the favorite of the U.S. skating establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two events in particular were cited: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Resentment over what he and his ex-wife believed was unfair scoring of 
Harding's performances at an international competition in Japan last December. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cover-story treatment of Kerrigan in U.S. Figure Skating Assn. publications 
leading up to the Detroit national championships in January. 
</P>
<P>
 This account of investigators was published Monday in the Oregonian. The 
newspaper indicated it received the information from two days of interrogation 
Gillooly underwent at the FBI office in Portland last week. It was not verified 
by officials willing to speak publicly, or by court documents. Moreover, 
Gillooly's statements are sure to be subject of doubt and challenge in this 
strange case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly's attorney said a statement would be made today after Gillooly's 
court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly is believed to be seeking a reduced sentence by cooperating with the 
investigation. He is understood to have told authorities he discussed his 
planning of the attack with Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's more detailed account of Gillooly's story added this: Harding's 
fourth-place finish in Japan so angered him that he began planning the assault 
on his own, and then discussed it with her. The skater's first reaction was to 
question whether Gillooly's associate and her acquaintance, Shawn Eckardt, was 
the right man for the job. Gillooly explained that Eckardt was only a 
go-between. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has denied knowing of the plot beforehand. But she has admitted 
learning of events afterward and not reporting this to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-member committee of the U.S. Figure Staking Assn. is to meet in 
Colorado today and begin deliberations on whether Harding should be 
disqualified from the Olympic competition Feb. 23 and 25 in Lillehammer, 
Norway. A decision is not expected until the end of the week, at the soonest. 
For now, she and Kerrigan are the U.S. team's two entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Phillip Knight, chief executive officer of Nike, said that the 
company would donate $25,000 to Harding to defend herself, should she be taken 
off the Olympic team. Harding is not affiliated with Nike, but the company is 
based near Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the last year, Harding has finished fourth in skating competitions 
and complained about the judging. 
</P>
<P>
 After the January 1993 U.S. championships in Phoenix, she told a Portland 
journalist that she got a raw deal. Kerrigan won that competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, after the NHK international competition in Japan Dec. 9-12, 
Harding returned unhappy with her scores -- particularly her low marks in the 
mandatory technical program. Harding did not fall but was scored lower than 
skaters who did. Kerrigan did not enter that event. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the account published Monday, Gillooly said he and Harding 
brooded over what they believed was favoritism toward Kerrigan by the U.S. 
Figure Skating Assn. Mentioned was the cover story on Kerrigan in the 
association's monthly magazine in December. Also mentioned was a "brochure" 
that highlighted Kerrigan. This might have been the media guide for the Detroit 
competition, which featured Kerrigan and other 1993 U.S. champions on the 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledgeable skating enthusiasts noted, however, that Harding has been on the 
cover ofthe association magazine and was on the cover of at least one of the 
organization's brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 As an event that depends entirely on the opinion of a specialized clique of 
judges, and where style and presentation are hugely subjective, grumbling about 
scoring and favoritism in figure skating is fairly widespread, although usually 
discreet. 
</P>
<P>
 USFSA officials responded to the investigation in Portland by saying they did 
not want to be dragged into the discussion.

Seton Hall made only eight baskets in the final 30 minutes but still avenged an 
earlier 24-point loss at Providence. . . . Malcolm Huckaby and Bill Curley 
keyed a 7-0 run as Boston College (16-5, 7-3) pulled away to a 71-64 Big East 
victory over Georgetown (11-6, 5-4) at Boston. Othella Harrington led the Hoyas 
with 22 points. . . . Damon Key scored 15 points and Marquette (13-5) shut down 
South Florida (9-9) for a 78-54 victory at Milwaukee.

MORNING BRIEFING: MAYBE FOOTBALL IS HELL FOR A BUFFALO FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marv Levy is the host of a radio talk show in Buffalo, and the Bills' coach 
told Steve Jacobson of Newsday about a man who called him every week. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the caller: "Coach, I want you to know you're not doing the right thing. 
You've got to tell your players this is war; football is war, it's war, I'm 
telling you." 
</P>
<P>
 So Levy decided to tell the caller about Art Donovan, a defensive lineman of 
the Baltimore Colts who knew both war and football. 
</P>
<P>
 "And," Levy said, "Artie told me, 'Believe me, football isn't war.' But the 
caller kept it up and kept it up. So last week, I finally told the guy, 'I've 
done you a disservice. I checked back in history and interviewed a bunch of 
guys who landed on the beaches of Iwo Jima and Normandy. And when they went in, 
they were all yelling, 'This is football!' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What was unusual about USC's 1976-77 basketball season? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise guest: Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman will be on the "Tonight Show" 
with Jay Leno tonight, which is no great surprise. He was on after last year's 
Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise came Monday night. While Leno was reading a joke about Gatorade 
sales dropping because no one would drink anything that dissolved in Cowboy 
Coach Jimmy Johnson's hair, Leno acted as if he hadn't seen that one. Then he 
noticed that Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly was holding the cue card. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasant interlude: Among the top 10 things Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said to 
his team at halftime of the Super Bowl, according to David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10: "We won! Woo! We're Super Bowl champs!" and No. 7: "Now get out there 
and rest on your laurels." There were also No. 5: "What do you mean there's two 
more quarters?" and No. 4:. "Let's plan exactly how you're gonna dump the 
Gatorade on me." And No. 1? "Hey, fellas, more fudge?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still painful: As soon as Buffalo won the AFC championship and was headed for 
the Super Bowl, former Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton was ready for the 
onslaught of telephone calls. Tarkenton was the quarterback in three of the 
Vikings' four Super Bowl losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other sport puts a negative connotation on its players the way football 
does," Tarkenton told the Chicago Sun-Times. "It's promulgated by the media, 
who hear it from the idiot coaches. What offends me as a football person and a 
football fan is not just the idea (about) the Buffalo Bills, but that any team 
that loses the Super Bowl is worse than any team that hasn't been there." 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose Tarkenton got more phone calls Monday? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More pain: Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Sun believed that NBC laid it on a 
little thick in the late going of Sunday's Super Bowl telecast, repeatedly 
invading the private misery of Thurman Thomas. Jackman wrote: "It seemed like 
the perfect spot for someone to utter, 'The Bills should get rid of this guy,' 
but then there would be no 'drive for five' next year, would there?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is reality? In the 15,000-seat MGM Grand Garden arena Sunday, fans could 
pay $10 to watch what was billed as a "virtual reality Super Bowl." While the 
game was being shown on a large TV screen, Hall of Fame quarterbacks Dan Fouts 
and Bob Griese and former kicker Mark Moseley passed and kicked footballs 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Ram cheerleaders were there, and every time a pass was completed 
on TV, a fan got to come out of the stands to catch a pass from Fouts or 
Griese. Moseley kicked to fans after each kick in the real game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The Trojans won 11 of their first 12 games and then closed out 
that season with 15 consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Michael Jordan, on his attempt to become a professional baseball 
player: "I am about to turn 31 years old. I am not a child. I know what I'm 
doing. I know there are people who have said: 'You retired from the Bulls, so 
just go away and let us remember what used to be.' If these people are tired of 
hearing my name, then they ought to quit saying it so often." MARYANN HUDSON

NBA ROUNDUP; MAVERICKS COME CLOSE, BUT LOSE TO HAWKS, 90-85 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks were tired Monday night, but not tired enough to lose to the 
hapless Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins scored 14 of his 24 points during a 36-19 third-quarter 
charge as the Hawks, playing for the fifth time in seven days, overcame a 
sluggish start to hold off the Mavericks, 90-85, at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell guys to keep focused, but there's always that tendency to 
concentrate on their record," Hawk Coach Lenny Wilkens said. "Dallas is playing 
with enthusiasm and pride right now, but it's hard to convince your players of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks, who snapped a league-record 19-game home losing streak Saturday 
night with a victory over the Sacramento Kings, gave the Hawks a scare as Doug 
Smith scored a season-high 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas had a 11-2 rally to close to 88-85 with 47 seconds to play, but Jamal 
Mashburn missed a three-pointer that would have tied the score with three 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Mookie Blaylock's two free throws with 0.9 seconds left sealed the victory for 
the Hawks, who trailed by six points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Close doesn't count," the Mavericks' Jim Jackson said. "You've got to finish 
it off. We had some breaks down the stretch, but we didn't take advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 107, Detroit 103 -- Mark Price scored six points down the stretch as 
the Cavaliers handed the Pistons their 10th consecutive home loss, which ties 
the club record. 
</P>
<P>
 Pistons, 5-17 at the Palace at Auburn Hills, Mich., have lost 20 of their last 
21 overall and six in a row. Their last victory at home was in overtime, 98-92, 
over Cleveland on Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Nance had 20 points for the Cavaliers, who are 7-14 on the road but have 
won three of their last four there. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Dumars scored 29 points for the Pistons. Isiah Thomas had 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the third quarter, Price and Thomas collided, knocking Price dizzy. 
But he was able to come back and deliver the knockout punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what he does," Cleveland Coach Mike Fratello said. "Mark gets battered 
and banged around, but he just keeps going."

MATADORS GET A TOUR, THEN A LICKING AT NOTRE DAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good day for Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors had an enjoyable tour of some of the landmarks around the Notre 
Dame campus on Monday, and even got to meet Irish football Coach Lou Holtz 
after their morning shoot-around. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they helped Notre Dame snap a six-game losing streak, 76-58, before 8,402 
at Joyce Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a tough two weeks for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake left several players homeless and the team without a 
home court to practice on. Then center Peter Micelli's father, the only 
Northridge fan to follow the team on the road, died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Pete Cassidy was hopeful that returning to basketball on a two-game trip 
that started Saturday in Chicago against Northeastern Illinois would be 
"therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
 For the mind, perhaps. But not for the basketball skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Notre Dame, the Matadors (3-14) committed 17 turnovers and shot 41%. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to sum up the experience, Cassidy replied, "Life on the road is hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Monty Williams paced Notre Dame (6-13) with 20 points. He also had 15 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Andre Chevalier and Brooklyn McLinn paced Northridge with 15 and 14 
points, respectively. However, the Matadors' starting front line of Micelli, 
Brent Lofton and Shawn Stone combined for only 12 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish, who play host to UCLA on Saturday, earned a 40-24 rebounding edge 
and outscored Northridge, 36-14, inside the key. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame had not won since upsetting Missouri, 77-73, on Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to see the guys smiling and laughing again," Irish Coach John 
MacLeod said. "It's an ordeal when you go 2 1/2 weeks without a win." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge can relate. The Matadors' last victory came more than three weeks 
ago. MIKE HISERMAN

HERNANDEZ DOES JOB, FINISHES OFF RAMIREZ; BOXING: NEXT FOR JUNIOR-LIGHTWEIGHT 
CHAMPION IS SURGERY TO REPLACE SCREW IN HIS HAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Genaro Hernandez, who entered the fight all set to take a six-month layoff, 
cruised through the early rounds, landed a flurry of combinations as the fight 
progressed, then took out Jorge (Cocas) Ramirez at 2:35 of the eighth round 
Monday night before 4,549 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Hernandez soaked his sore hands in ice and prepared for a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, bleeding heavily from two cuts near his right eye, did not protest 
when the referee stopped the fight with Hernandez firing hard left hooks 
without Ramirez answering. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hernandez, it was his seventh successful defense of the World Boxing Assn. 
junior-lightweight title, and it comes as he prepares to take a layoff due to 
imminent surgery to replace a screw in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez (30-0-1, with 15 knockouts), who flinched several times after 
landing with the sore hand, said he wanted to make sure he was patient against 
the veteran Ramirez (64-11-3). 
</P>
<P>
 On all three judges' cards, Hernandez won every round. 
</P>
<P>
 The champion, five inches taller than the challenger, allowed himself to be 
caught on the ropes several times in the early going, choosing to absorb 
Ramirez's short punches in exchange for big hooks of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just went out there to do what I do best, and that's box," Hernandez said. 
"I wanted to take my time, relax, use my skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went in knowing I'm better than Cocas Ramirez, I'm a better fighter. I 
wasn't overconfident, but I knew. I didn't want to go out there just throwing 
punches all over and being careless." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first two rounds, Hernandez did not move much and stood up straight as 
Ramirez bored into him. By the middle of the second, Ramirez had a small cut 
under his eye and Hernandez had been hit with some solid inside shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did that on purpose," Hernandez said. "My brother told me I was getting 
the better of those exchanges. We knew that Cocas is an inside puncher and when 
he does that he tends to open up and I could get him with some clean shots." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez's generally sluggish appearance in the first two rounds worried 
his corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wondering when he was going to wake up and get into this fight," said 
Hernandez's brother and trainer, Rudy. "He was just enjoying himself, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew he has a long layoff after this, and maybe he just wanted to stay in 
there, box, and get as much work as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 By the third, Hernandez began to control the fight, slugging it out with 
Ramirez in the middle of the ring at the end of the round and knocking him back 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth, Hernandez teed off on Ramirez and opened up a large cut over the 
challenger's eye, producing large amounts of blood for the rest of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the fight, with Ramirez throwing few punches, Hernandez picked 
him with thudding left hooks and occasionally flashing the right across 
Ramirez's wide open chin. There were no knockdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez admitted he backed off at times when he could have gone in for the 
kill to make sure Ramirez didn't head-butt him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big problem he has," Rudy Hernandez said. "He doesn't want to get 
cut with a head butt and it's hard to be effective inside when you do that. We 
haven't figured that out yet.' 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said both his hands hurt after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez has surgery scheduled for February for his hand, and said his first 
fight after the surgery will be a mandatory defense of his title. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier fights, Young Dick Tiger scored an impressive first-round technical 
knockout over Florencio Loprez Ibarra, landing a sharp left hook that dropped 
him hard to the canvas. The referee stopped it at 2:34 of the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger raised his record to 29-10 (19 KOs) and Ibarra fell to 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In a heavyweight bout, Dave Dixon (17-2, 15 KOs) took a technical knockout of 
Gary Winmon (13-2) at 2:27 of the first round.

 Police were also investigating an unnamed Nebraska defensive back for a 
shooting incident that occurred after the other incidents and left two bullets 
in the rear panel of a car.

 Police did not say if the shooting was related to the earlier incidents. But 
Coach Tom Osborne, in a news conference, indicated players in the car were 
aware of the earlier incidents.

 Who says it's so hard to repeat? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys have won the last two Super Bowls, the Chicago Bulls the 
last three NBA championships, and the Toronto Blue Jays the last two World 
Series. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But you have to go back to 1962 for the last time there were repeat winners in 
all three sports -- the Green Bay Packers in the NFL, the Boston Celtics in the 
NBA, and the New York Yankees in baseball. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nevada bookmakers have already established the Cowboys as favorites to become 
the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowls. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dallas should remain on top for at least another year simply because it has 
the best players and the best coach in the league. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I agree with Emmitt Smith. Cowboy safety James Washington from UCLA and Jordan 
High should have been voted most valuable player of the game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In 28 Super Bowls, the only defensive players to win the award have been 
linebacker Chuck Howley of Dallas in V, safety Jake Scott of Miami in VII, 
tackle Randy White and end Harvey Martin of Dallas co-honored in XII, and end 
Richard Dent of Chicago in XX. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What do the voters have against defenders from L.A.? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oakland Raider linebacker Rod Martin from USC and Hamilton High intercepted 
three Philadelphia passes in Super Bowl XV, but quarterback Jim Plunkett was 
voted most valuable. . . .

 Don't look for Duke to remain No. 1 in the college basketball polls for long. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils' next game is Thursday at North Carolina. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is disappointing that such a fundamentally sound player as Jason Kidd of 
California is as inept as most college shooters from the free-throw line. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA-USC game Thursday at Pauley Pavilion is a sellout, but, surprise, 
will be televised live by Channel 5. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Leslie of USC and Natalie Williams of UCLA, the two best collegiate 
women's forwards in town and probably the nation, will play Friday at the Lyon 
Center. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Leslie was named by 58% of voters who were asked to select the top two 
midseason candidates for the Naismith Award. . . .

NOTRE DAME BREAKS STREAK AT NORTHRIDGE'S EXPENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good day for Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad night. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge had an enjoyable tour of some of the historical landmarks around 
the Notre Dame campus on Monday, and even got to glad-hand Irish football Coach 
Lou Holtz after its morning shoot-around. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Matadors went out and graciously helped Notre Dame snap a six-game 
losing streak, 76-58, before 8,402 at Joyce Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the luck of the Irish was not with Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy, 
who started his head coaching career at Notre Dame -- the high school in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, Cassidy & Co. seem to be governed by Murphy's Law. 
</P>
<P>
 First came the tragedy of the Jan. 17 earthquake, then the death of center 
Peter Micelli's father, then the news that forward Chris Yard was out for the 
season with knee and hand injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy hoped a return to basketball on a two-day trip that started Saturday 
in Chicago against Northeastern Illinois would be "therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
 For the mind, perhaps. But not for the basketball skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Notre Dame, the Matadors (3-14) committed 17 turnovers and shot poorly 
-- 41% -- even by their standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to sum up the experience, Cassidy replied, "Life on the road is hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach, get used to it. Northridge doesn't have a home game for another 10 
days. And even that, with the damage to the team's home court, seems 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, the Matadors have seen the last of Notre Dame forward 
Monty Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a standout player on an otherwise average team, paced Notre Dame 
(6-13) with 20 points -- a modest total considering he scored 34 against Duke 
and 31 against Providence in his previous two games. He also had 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Andre Chevalier and Brooklyn McLinn paced Northridge with 15 and 14 
points. However, the Matadors' starting front line of Micelli, Brent Lofton and 
Shawn Stone combined for only 12 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish, who play host to used-to-be top-ranked UCLA on Saturday, earned a 
40-24 rebounding edge and outscored Northridge, 36-14, inside the key. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge did score sympathy points with an unusually polite Irish crowd and 
a local media contingent, which were far more curious about the quake than they 
were Northridge's basketball fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake had nothing to do with this game," Micelli said. "We just have to 
play harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge led only once, 2-0, though the Matadors were only down by a basket, 
24-22, with 4 minutes 30 seconds in the half. Then the Irish ran off nine 
consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame boosted its lead to as many as 20 points in the second half before 
Coach John MacLeod mercifully emptied his bench. All 16 players in uniform saw 
action, and 11 scored. Guard Keith Kurowski had 13 points for Notre Dame and 
reserve floor leader Admore White had eight points nine assists and four 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish had not won since upsetting Missouri, 77-73, on Jan. 12. "It's great 
to see the guys smiling and laughing again," MacLeod said. "It's an ordeal when 
you go 2 1/2 weeks without a win." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which has lost four in a row, can relate. The Matadors' last win 
came more than three weeks ago.

COLLEGE BASEBALL PREVIEW; CAL STATE FULLERTON WILL BE DAUNTING WITH DANTE AT 
BAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dante Powell did not waste any time making his pivotal junior season an 
impressive one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Fullerton center fielder had seven hits in 15 at-bats, drove in 
three runs and stole four bases last weekend as the Titans won two of three 
games in a season-opening series at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell has been looking forward to this season since 1991, when he passed up a 
$425,000 offer from the Toronto Blue Jays after they chose him with a 
supplemental first-round draft pick out of Long Beach Millikan High. Powell, 6 
feet 2 and 185 pounds, is expected to be one of the first players chosen in 
this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 With Powell leading the way, Fullerton is expected to win the Big West 
Conference title and reach the College World Series for the second time in 
three years. Fullerton lost to Pepperdine in the 1992 national championship 
game. Last season, the Titans were eliminated by USC in the Central II Regional 
at Austin, Tex., and finished 35-19. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team compares to the one I played on as a freshman," said Powell, who 
batted .335 with 12 home runs, 57 runs batted in and 42 stolen bases last 
season. "We have a lot of experience and leadership mixed with some talented 
incoming players.  
</P>
<P>
 "This year, I'll probably take more of a leadership role. It's a natural move 
because I'm pretty vocal." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton has a veteran pitching staff, including senior right-hander Dan 
Ricabal, who was 11-3 with a 3.49 earned-run average last season, and junior 
right-hander Mike Parisi (10-3, 4.71). Adam Millan (.354, seven homers, 57 
RBIs) moved from catcher to first base, and second baseman Jeff Ferguson (.318) 
and outfielder Jim Betzold (.310) also returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers include freshman left-hander Mark Kotsay and freshman outfielder 
Jeremy Giambi. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido said the Titans' success will be tied to 
Powell's ability to deal with the pressure of performing during his draft year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to have a big impact on this team," Garrido said. "If he is 
distracted and intimidated by it, then his progress will be slow. You can't 
play to a mythical expectation level." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the other Southland Division I teams: 
</P>
<P>
 * USC 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 35-29 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Trojans came within a bounce of advancing to the championship 
game against Texas in the Central II Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Gillespie has seven starting position players back, including 
sophomore shortstop Gabe Alvarez (.326), a freshman All- American last season. 
Sophomore outfielder Geoff Jenkins (.323) is coming off a dominant summer in 
the Alaska League, and junior third baseman Aaron Boone (.286) is a 
All-American candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Like every team in the Pacific 10 Southern Division, the Trojans have an 
untested pitching staff. Senior right-hander Tony Nieto, who began his college 
career as a catcher, is the ace. Nieto was 8-5 with a 3.52 ERA last season. Ben 
Tucker (2-7, 5.37) and Grant Vermillion (3-2, 5.67) will also be starters. USC 
must find a way to offset the loss of closer Dan Hubbs, who had 18 saves in 
1993. Justin Parle (3-0, 4.57) will be the No. 1 reliever.  
</P>
<P>
 * UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 37-23 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Adams, in his 20th season as coach of the Bruins, lost seven of the nine 
players drafted off last year's team that advanced to the Central I Regional at 
College Station, Tex., including All-American first baseman Ryan McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Mike Mitchell (.314, 12 homers) replaces McGuire at first base. Senior 
outfielder David Roberts (.296, 28 steals) and infielder Travis Boyd, a 
redshirt junior, have returned after rejecting pro offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Redshirt sophomore Brian Stephenson (5-4, 4.85 and four saves), a transfer 
from UC Santa Barbara, is the Bruins' No. 1 starter. The Bruin staff also 
includes freshmen Seth Bean, 12-1 at Lompoc High in 1993, and John Phillips, 
14-0 at Bullard High in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 * LONG BEACH STATE 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 46-19 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, who came within three outs of playing for the national championship 
last season, are trying to make their fourth World Series appearance in six 
seasons under Coach Dave Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 To get there, Long Beach must find a way to replace Daniel Choi, who was 17-2 
as a draft-eligible sophomore last year. Choi signed a professional contract in 
Korea, elevating Mike Fontana (9-3, 2.94) to staff ace. The 49ers also have 
left-hander Gabe Gonzalez (4-3, 1.54, 13 saves), who suffered the season-ending 
loss to eventual national champion Louisiana State. Freshman right-hander 
Marcus Jones should also figure prominently. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore first baseman Jeff Liefer (.356, 12 homers, 54 RBIs) is the top 
returning position player. Key newcomers include Snow's son, Casey, a freshman 
catcher, and outfielder Rolando Avila and shortstop Ryan Miller, who are JC 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 * PEPPERDINE 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 41-17 
</P>
<P>
 An influx of talented transfers and freshmen could give the Waves a legitimate 
shot at their ninth West Coast Conference championship in 10 seasons and their 
second NCAA title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Coached by Andy Lopez, Pepperdine already had a formidable pitching staff with 
sophomore starters Greg Gregory (7-3, 2.65) and Jason LeBlanc (7-4, 2.83), and 
senior relievers Mauricio Estavil (5-0, 2.64, five saves) and Adam Housley 
(4-4, 1.93, four saves). It got even stronger when Jason Dietrich transferred 
from Rancho Santiago College, Cade Gaspar transferred from Saddleback College 
and Matt Wise passed up a six-figure pro offer and joined the Waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Other transfers who will have an immediate impact include catcher Keith 
McDonald and first baseman Greg Tippin from Cypress College, second baseman 
David Rosato from Harbor College and infielder David Newhan from Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 * LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Record: 23-33 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions have one of the most talented two-way players in the country in 
junior Jesse Ibarra, who was selected in the fifth round of last year's draft 
by the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra batted .299 with 17 homers and was 2-1 with a 3.41 ERA and four saves 
in 1993. Junior outfielder Mike Peters (.365) and senior first baseman Anthony 
Napolitano (.315) will help Coach Jody Robinson's team in the West Coast 
Conference race. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Shawn Hammett (7-8, 5.38) and sophomore Ryan Graves (5- 6, 4.59) are 
the top returning pitchers. Freshman Jason Hueth is the top recruit on the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
 * CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Record: 36-20 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, under Coach Bill Kernen, are seeking their fourth consecutive 
regional appearance since joining Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kempton (10-4, 3.99), Marco Contreras (8-4, 3.98) and Johnny Najar (5-2, 
5.93) have returned from a staff that helped the Matadors advance to the West I 
regional at Tempe, Ariz. Senior second baseman Keyaan Cook (.306) is the top 
returning hitter. First baseman Jason Shanahan (.271) and center fielder Joey 
Arnold (.264) also are back. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Eric Gillespie and first baseman Andy Shaw are highly regarded 
freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 * UC SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Record: 24-30-1 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos have a new coach in Bob Brontsema and a new facility in 1,000-seat 
Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. They also have three talented sophomores in first 
baseman/pitcher Jared Janke (.330, 13 homers), outfielder Wynter Phoenix (.315) 
and third baseman Zach Elliott (.307). 
</P>
<P>
 Senior shortstop Matt Bokemeier (.342) is the most experienced player. 
</P>
<P>
 * CHAPMAN 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Record: 22-32 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, under first-year Coach Rex Peters, will play only two games 
against Division I opponents this season as they prepare to move to Division 
III next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-hander James Thomas, who had tendinitis last season, has beaten 
Pepperdine, UCLA and USC during his career.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; IN FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT, LEAGUE STILL HAS PUNCH 
LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the traditionalists, all the Don Cherry fans who predicted that the 
NHL would become soft under an American commissioner, fear not. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting is actually on the rise this season, judging from the 41% increase in 
major fighting penalties assessed through Sunday. In 651 games, 1,056 fighting 
majors had been handed out, contrasted with 747 fighting majors in 651 games 
last season. That should keep all the makers of fight tapes in business and 
delight Cherry, the acerbic TV analyst who proclaimed that the NHL was on the 
verge of becoming a pacifists' paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL executives say the new numbers reflect increased competitiveness. 
Divisional rivalries always fostered rough stuff, but conference rankings now 
determine playoff seedings instead of division standings. There are more 
intraconference games than intradivision games, providing more opportunities 
for fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's because of the conference format, and I think it should level 
off as teams establish those turf battles," said Brian Burke, NHL senior vice 
president and director of hockey operations. "If it doesn't, then we have to 
find out what the reason is." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman said his priority is to eliminate 
"extracurriculars," such as head-butts, checks from behind and dangerous 
stickwork, through supplementary discipline -- meaning suspensions -- before he 
deals with fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had eight suspensions in October, eight in November, three in December and 
two in January, one of which (Rick Zombo's slash of Kevin Collins) could have 
been a rulebook suspension," Bettman said. "At this particular point in time 
we're not focused on that (fighting) issue. At some point we'll study it, 
because at some point we're going to study everything." 
</P>
<P>
 That study would find players opposed to a ban on fighting. "I don't think you 
can ever take it out of the game," Detroit defenseman Paul Coffey said. "It's 
probably not as premeditated as in the past. You'll see a couple of guys fight 
for 30 seconds and it's over. If you talk to a lot of players, you'll find 
they'll take a punch in the head over a stick in the face or stick in the 
groin." STANDARDS, PLEASE 
</P>
<P>
 We can live with flying ducks making hokey entrances at Anaheim Arena and with 
Harvey the Hound, the Calgary Flames' mascot, doing a mock striptease by hiking 
up his costume pants and twirling his dog collar in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 But sumo hockey, that's time to draw the line. 
</P>
<P>
 A new intermission show around the NHL features two contestants, dressed like 
the Michelin tire man and wearing sumo wrestler headgear, "playing" hockey. 
With their bulk, all they do is slip-slide along the ice as they shoot the puck 
into nets set against the side boards. When they fall, they struggle like 
turtles to get up. All this for the glory of a certain beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, fans deserve to be entertained all night when they shell out big bucks 
for tickets. But there must be something better than that . CAPITAL OFFENSES 
</P>
<P>
 They tried Bryan Murray. They tried his brother, Terry Murray. And still the 
Washington Capitals can't get past the early rounds of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They passed up Winnipeg assistant Andy Murray (no relation) when they fired 
Terry Murray and lured Jim Schoenfeld out of the ESPN booth to coach. 
Washington hasn't missed the playoffs since 1982, but would be an outsider if 
the season were to end today. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld, a fiery leader in Buffalo and New Jersey, has an emotional spark 
the listless Capitals need. The key is whether he has learned to temper his 
impatience, which undermined his stay with the Devils and led to his firing 14 
games into the 1989-90 season. Even if he succeeds, it might be too late to 
save General Manager David Poile, whose contract is up at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld's return is likely to increase sales of diet programs among 
referees. Remember, Schoenfeld earned hockey immortality during the 1988 
playoffs when he screamed at Don Koharski, "Have another doughnut, you fat 
pig." You've got to love a guy who finds that the worst thing he can say. HOLD 
THAT MIKE 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld joins a parade of broadcasters leaving studios and press tables to 
coach. Pat Riley of the New York Knicks, Quinn Buckner of the Dallas Mavericks 
and Mike Fratello of the Cleveland Cavaliers made the jump in the NBA. The 
NHL's list includes Jacques Demers, who did radio work between leaving the Red 
Wings in 1990 and joining the Montreal Canadiens in '92; and Mike Keenan, who 
was a radio and TV analyst between jobs with the Chicago Blackhawks and New 
York Rangers. TIP OF THE SALARY CAP 
</P>
<P>
 League officials were furious when the NHL Players Assn. spread word it had 
rejected a collective bargaining proposal that involved a salary cap. As the 
league saw it, that violated an agreement to avoid commenting on talks. It 
won't help the tone of negotiations, which resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 The association is adamant about rejecting any form of cap, but Bettman is 
expected to press for it, and the possibility of a player strike increases with 
every verbal salvo. So does the pessimism of Ranger fans, who figure that since 
the only thing that can keep them from winning the Stanley Cup is a strike, a 
strike is sure to be called. Two years ago, the Rangers finished first overall 
but were thrown off stride by a brief April walkout and lost in the second 
round of the playoffs. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks believe the NHL is discriminating against them by assigning 
young, inexperienced referees to their games. They have a point: In 27 of their 
45 games, the referee had two years' experience or less. Also, neither Kerry 
Fraser nor Andy van Hellemond, considered the top referees, has worked at 
Anaheim Arena, although every referee is supposed to work everywhere once. 
"It's a concern," General Manager Jack Ferreira said of the assignments. . . . 
The Rangers had a deal with the Vancouver Canucks for center Petr Nedved but 
backed out when Nedved's agent, Tony Kondel, demanded a $1.4-million payment 
and more in performance bonuses. . . . The Toronto Maple Leafs will have to 
sustain their 7-0-3 streak without defenseman Bob Rouse, who had arthroscopic 
knee surgery and is out at least two weeks. . . . Roger Neilson's defensive 
system isn't pretty, but Florida keeps winning. The Panthers have given up only 
17 goals during their 5-0-4 surge, the longest unbeaten streak ever by an 
expansion club.

 Anyone with a passing knowledge of the Marina girls' basketball team is aware 
of Shandy Robbins, who averaged 18 points and nine rebounds in the Vikings' 
Sunset League victories over No. 6 Ocean View, No. 7 Fountain Valley and 
Westminster.But although her stats aren't as impressive, Emde was no less 
important. Emde, who also is a defensive standout, scored 12 points in the 
48-45 victory over Ocean View, had 12 points and eight assists in a 59-47 
victory over Westminster and scored 17 -- 14 in the second half -- in a 49-43

PREP ROUNDUP; NO. 1 CORONA DEL MAR SHUTS OUT SANTA MARGARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Margarita Coach Curt Bauer didn't offer any excuses or explanations for 
his team's 3-0 loss to top-ranked Corona del Mar Monday. He simply stated the 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They beat us the first 20 minutes," Bauer said. "That's why they're the No. 1 
team and we're not. They're a better team and there's not much else to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, but Santa Margarita sweeper John Bamford added some insight anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came out harder than we did," Bamford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Dustin Lee appeared to come out the hardest of all the Sea Kings. 
He scored two goals in six minutes and almost had a third except for a 
spectacular save by goalkeeper Brian Casola. 
</P>
<P>
 And though he was on the sideline nursing a sore leg, Lee was directly 
responsible for the Sea Kings' third goal. He was kicked by a Santa Margarita 
player, resulting in a penalty kick for the Sea Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jed Weinstein converted by easily slipping the ball past a diving Casola in 
the left corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The play got extremely physical from there as Santa Margarita tried to get 
back into the game. The Eagles' best chance to score came with minutes left to 
play when midfielder Chon Kantikvit's drive glanced off the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get frustrated if things don't go right," Lee said. "They started 
yelling at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-ranked Saddleback fell to 11-3-4 and 4-3-4 in the Sea View League. 
Corona del Mar improved to 16-2-3, 9-0-1. But things don't get any easier for 
Corona del Mar, which plays today at third-ranked Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who made our schedule, but if we can get by this week, we're in 
the clear," Lee said. DAVE McKIBBEN

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; SAILORS GET HEAD START ON TUSTIN BEFORE HEADS 
ARRIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Genevieve Evarts scored 25 points. Dianne Pulido scored 14, had 17 rebounds 
and six steals. Melissa Schutz forced Tustin's center, Alison Carr, out of the 
game with five fouls.Mandy Clayton kept Tustin's best shooter, Katie 
Scheuerman, from scoring in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor is one team that knows how to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-ranked Sailors virtually guaranteed they'll finish no worse than 
second in the Sea View League by beating visiting Tustin, 57-47, Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Heads, their playmaker, entered the gym five minutes into the game after 
X-rays revealed her ankle wasn't broken -- a possibility suggested by her 
physical therapist two hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Heads entered the game, with 3 minutes 35 seconds left in the 
second quarter, Newport Harbor led, 19-14. The Sailors (16-5, 9-1) had just 
given up two baskets after scoring 13 consecutive points. Then they scored 
eight more. After trailing, 10-6, they led at halftime, 28-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team is so balanced, we can distribute the responsibility," Evarts said 
of Newport Harbor's ability to pick up the slack left by Heads' relatively 
minor contribution (two points, three rebounds, four steals). 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's defense played a key role. Tustin had three stretches without 
a field goal that totaled more than 15 minutes of game time. The Tillers had 26 
turnovers. MARTIN HENDERSON

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: INCIDENTS SHAKE UP SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a difficult couple of weeks for the Simi Valley High boys' 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems began on Jan. 14 when Coach Dean Bradshaw shoved senior reserve 
guard Sam Rodriguez for not playing well during the fourth quarter of a 
Marmonte League game against Westlake. Rodriguez, pulled from the game, was 
walking toward the bench when Bradshaw grabbed him by the neck and shoved him 
to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was not injured. Simi Valley won the game, 51-44. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw, who has declined to discuss the matter in detail, has been suspended 
from coaching while officials of the Simi Valley Unified School District review 
the case. His fate might be decided at a school board meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides not having a coach, the Pioneers are also without a gymnasium. Damaged 
in the Jan. 17 earthquake, it is closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley played for the first time since the shoving incident last Friday 
and defeated Camarillo, 59-49. The game was held at a continuation high school 
in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw did not attend the game, and his assistants, Steve Johnson and 
Christian Aurand, refused to coach in his place. Filling in was Brian Saunders, 
a Simi Valley lawyer who played one season in the NBA and has coached many of 
the players in youth basketball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders returned to the bench Saturday night, guiding the Pioneers to a 63-49 
victory over Newbury Park. With Bradshaw watching from the bleachers, Simi 
Valley improved to 14-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw has been Simi Valley's coach for the last six years. He won a 
Southern Section title in 1988 and his teams have reached the playoffs every 
season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Security will be heavy when Gardena Serra and Santa Monica St. Monica meet in 
a boys' basketball game on Feb. 9 at Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals of the schools have been ordered to meet during the next week in 
hopes of providing a safe environment for everyone. Tempers are still 
smoldering over a fight that broke out between the teams in a game last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With six minutes to play in the third quarter of the Camino Real League 
showdown, Ken Jackson of St. Monica and Duane Thalley of Serra fought for an 
inbounds pass. With neither player relinquishing possession, they began pushing 
and shoving each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, players and coaches from both teams and several fans rushed 
onto the court. Order was quickly restored, and Jackson and Thalley were 
ejected. After a 15-minute delay, play resumed and Serra won, 57-51. 
</P>
<P>
 During the chaos, Serra Coach Dwan Hurt hit a parent who was hitting one of 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt Hemenway, president of the Camino Real League and principal at 
Montebello Cantwell-Sacred Heart, headed a committee that reviewed the incident 
last Friday. They said videotape showed that Hurt did a good job of trying to 
restore order. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that there was no police security at the last game because the Santa 
Monica Police Department was on tactical alert after the earthquake and had no 
officers available. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Lakewood Artesia's dominance in boys' basketball has come to a halt this 
season after the school had won three state titles in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the graduation of Charles O'Bannon and Avondre Jones, who are now playing 
at UCLA and USC, respectively, the Pioneers have not been the same. They are 
struggling with an 11-9 record, and their 52-48 loss to Lakewood Mayfair last 
week ended a 51-game winning streak in the Suburban League. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a major deal in our area, to win this game," Mayfair Coach Joe 
Tereschuk said. "We hadn't beaten them in six years, and the game was on local 
cable television." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monsoons held a 50-48 lead with 18 seconds left before Jason Birdwell made 
two free throws to wrap up the victory that gave them a 10-11 record. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Girls' basketball in California is expected to have a major rule change next 
season: The midcourt stripe will be used for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, it is not a violation if the offense advances the ball to the front 
court and then returns it to the back court. The change would make the girls' 
game the same as the boys'. The girls' 30-second shot clock will remain in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule proposal will be voted on next month during the CIF State Council 
meeting. The Southern Section will support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Leodes Van Buren of Newbury Park, the state's all-time leading receiver, said 
he will sign with Colorado on national signing day Wednesday. Van Buren, 6 feet 
1 and 190 pounds, had 1,658 receiving yards and 20 touchdowns as a senior, 
4,446 yards and 44 touchdowns for his career. . . . Kicker Adam Abrams of La 
Jolla Bishop School said he would attend USC. Abrams is a consensus prep 
All-American and the most recruited kicker in the country. . . . Despite pleas 
from the Southern California Officials Assn., the Southern Section Council 
voted against a proposal to implement a 10-run mercy rule. Officials wanted the 
rule change to make their time more cost effective. Most area baseball coaches, 
however, were opposed to it. . . . Ed Zintel, formerly sports editor of the 
South Orange County News, is the new media director for the Southern Section.

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: TROJANS HAVE A FAMILIAR LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The USC men's volleyball team has the same players, but a new attitude. And 
that has made all the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (2-0) won the UC Santa Barbara tournament last month and is ready to 
regain its traditional spot among the nation's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 With five starters back from last year's team, that doesn't seem like such a 
big deal. After all, USC went 18-12 last season, missing the NCAA final four 
for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Jim McLaughlin has been rebuilding since U.S. national team member 
Bryan Ivie finished at USC in 1991. This season, McLaughlin has everything in 
place to contend for a national title. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? The attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you believe you're good and you believe you can win the match and just 
stay united and together, you're going to be all right," McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpieces of the team are 6-foot-6 senior middle blocker Pat Ivie, 
Bryan's younger brother; 6-5 senior opposite hitter Chris Underwood and 6-7 
swing hitter Jason Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting roles are played by returning sophomore starters Russell Brock, 
a 6-3 swing hitter; and Steve Loeswick, a 6-5 setter, and freshman Eric 
Seiffert, a 6-6 middle blocker from Capistrano Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have your feelings going into every year, and this year, I feel really 
good," McLaughlin said. "The better you are, the bigger the challenge, and 
we've got a big challenge ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for USC, it can never count out its cross-town rival. 
</P>
<P>
 So sure is he that UCLA, which has won 14 NCAA titles, will repeat as national 
champion, Ted Green of Volleyball magazine wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "(It) is kind of like saying Norm Peterson is expected to order a beer when he 
walks into Cheers, except with lesser odds." 
</P>
<P>
 But after hearing everyone sing their praises, the Bruins promptly lost to BYU 
in the semifinals of the Santa Barbara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat, however, hardly worried Al Scates, who is in his 32nd year as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a few little things that we are still trying to work on," Scates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Jeff Nygaard, considered the premier middle blocker in college 
volleyball, will move to opposite hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get the ball to him more often -- he's our best hitter -- and it's 
easier to get it to him there," Scates said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the 6-8 Nygaard in the middle, the Bruins will lean on returning 
starter Tim Kelly, a 6-10 senior, and John Speraw, a 6-5 junior who played in 
only six matches last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Another change for the Bruins will be at setter, where sophomore Stein Metzger 
will replace All-American Mike Sealy, who finished his eligibility last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those changes, UCLA (4-1) is the hands-down favorite to win the 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Scates had this prediction last week before UCLA played BYU on Friday and 
Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get by (BYU) this weekend, I don't see anybody stopping us because 
we're going to be a hell of a lot better later on." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA won, 3-0, both nights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pepperdine men's volleyball team is not what it used to be. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At outside hitter, Tom Sorensen, the Waves' top player, has finished his 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At middle blocker, two transfers with minimal volleyball experience will be 
asked to start, hardly the norm on a team that went 55-19 the past three years 
and won the 1992 national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Many players will try to replace Sorensen, the Waves' all-time leader in 
kills. Most will fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves also are unsettled at middle blocker, where Coach Marv Dunphy will 
call upon John Bowling, a sophomore transfer from Tennessee, and Lee Bradford, 
a junior transfer from Pierce, to replace three-year starter Duane Cameron, who 
finished his eligibility last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Both will have to take big strides to make an impact at the NCAA Division I 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of teacher am I?" Dunphy recently wondered aloud. "We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Monumental" is the only way to describe the personnel losses absorbed by the 
Long Beach State men's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest hole was left by Brent Hilliard, a two-time NCAA player of the 
year and member of the 1992 bronze-medal U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard finished his eligibility last season, as did setter Jason Stimpfig 
and outside hitter Zachary Small. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, 6-7 middle blocker Matthew Suttie, the 49ers' top recruit last 
season, recently quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Coach Ray Ratelle, Suttie never met the expectations that had 
been set for him as a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just told us that he was getting tired of practicing, and he didn't have 
the desire to continue to work this hard in volleyball," Ratelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The season so far has been more than a little aggravating for Ratelle, who led 
the 49ers to a national championship in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough," Ratelle said. "I really have to remind myself to be patient, 
because I've been getting frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Four current and two former UCLA gymnasts will compete at the U.S. Olympic 
Training Center in Colorado Springs on Friday and Saturday to try to qualify 
for the U.S. Winter Cup Challenge. Sophomores Steve McCain and Jim Foody, 
junior Mike DeNucci and former Bruins Scott Keswick and Chainey Umphrey will 
try for places on the U.S. senior elite national team, while freshman Spencer 
Slaton will try to finish among the top seven juniors and earn a spot on the 
U.S junior elite national team.

VALLEY-AREA DIGEST: CONNORS' HEARING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pre-trial hearing in the case of former Hart High quarterback Ryan Connors 
was delayed Monday because his defense plans to introduce evidence that Connors 
was not legally drunk during a high-speed collision last July, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Steve Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors is charged with two felony counts (driving under the influence of 
alcohol and driving with a blood-alcohol level of .08 or above) and one 
misdemeanor count (reckless driving causing injury) in an accident on San 
Fernando Road that left another motorist seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors' defense attorneys told San Fernando Superior Court Judge Shari Silver 
they plan to show evidence that Connors' blood-alcohol content was below the 
California legal limit of .08 despite two previous readings of .08 or above. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Connors set a then-Southern Section record by passing for 4,144 yards 
in his senior season. DANA HADDAD

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; FRITSCHI FITS RIGHT IN WITH ANTEATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antje Fritschi loves Southern California. She came here from Germany two years 
ago and was the State singles tennis champion at Grossmont College last season. 
She loves the weather, the beaches, the tennis, everything except maybe the 
freeways. But none of that prepared her for her welcome to UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritschi returned from her home in Feiberg a few days before school started, 
rented an apartment and got a roommate, through the advertising on campus, to 
share expenses. She had scarcely met her new companion, however, when she 
returned home from a tennis workout to find yet another roomie, a rat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in from practice and this thing was running around the living room. I 
was totally freaking out," she said, showing fine command of her Southland 
English. "So I jumped up on a table. I don't handle rats too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I told my dad, he said, 'Why didn't you scoop it up with the tennis 
racket and put it back in the cage?' But I was so scared, I couldn't even get 
that close." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritschi had a little talk with her roommate about her pet's house privileges, 
but it took one more incident before it was permanently confined to its cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another time she let it out and she couldn't find it," Fritschi said. "We 
found it on my bed. Eeaagh."  
</P>
<P>
 The rat is fortunate Fritschi is so frightened of rodents. It's unlikely it 
would have survived one of her forehands. Few two-legged opponents do. Fritschi 
signed on with the Anteaters and immediately became their No. 1 singles player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antje has a powerful game and a very aggressive style," Coach Doreen Irish 
said. "She likes to get to the net and win the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritschi's tennis career began when she was 6 and her parents took up the 
sport. She played on club teams until she was 15, when she decided she would 
become a "regular teen-ager" and chase boys instead of tennis balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the age," she says. "I just wanted to be with my friends and have 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 It was about that time that Fritschi made her first trip to California, and 
she knew then she would be back. After graduating from high school in Germany, 
she took a month-long course to polish her English in preparation for college 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met some people there who were going to Grossmont, so I went, too," she 
said. "But at that time, I hadn't even thought about playing tennis. My friends 
kept saying, 'Why don't you try out for the team?' So I finally decided to try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been four or five years without any training, just playing for fun on 
weekends, so it was very hard, both physically and mentally, to play in 
tournaments again. The first couple didn't go very well, either." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fritschi, who grew up playing long rallies on clay courts, quickly 
adjusted to the fast lane of the Southland's hard courts and developed a strong 
serve-and-volley style. 
</P>
<P>
 "After about half a year, I got it back and the rest of my time at Grossmont 
was really, really fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's little chance of Jennifer Capriati Syndrome here. Fritschi's 
burning with enthusiasm, not burning out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had continued playing, I might have been saying, 'Enough tennis,' by 
now," she said, "but I had so much fun at Grossmont, I'm really excited now 
that the season has started here." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritschi is 1-1 this season -- she lost to UCLA's Keri Phebus Friday -- but 
life is good. She enjoys her classes, the weather outside is anything but 
frightful and, best of all, the rat is back in the cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could easily imagine living here," she said, "but all my family is back 
home. Now I can go back in the summer and for a month in the winter, but if I 
went to work, it would be harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I don't know. When people ask, I just say I'm keeping my options open." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a totally laid-back, California attitude, dude. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Spin doctor: Rod Baker seems at peace with the world these days, and that's a 
bit unusual for a basketball coach who has lost four in a row and seven of the 
last eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (5-11, 2-6 in the Big West) have lost back-to-back overtime 
games despite aggressive and intense efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot easier to put a positive spin on things when you play well and 
things just don't work out," Baker said. "We didn't play well after the first 
five minutes against (Nevada) Las Vegas and we didn't play well against San 
Jose State. Every other (conference) game was winable." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Irvine's last seven defeats were two-point margins and two went into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get blown out by 30, there's too many things to fix and guys start 
to think, 'It wasn't anything I did,' " Baker said. "But this is fixable. 
Everybody can think of one play here or there and it's a different outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came back and practiced really hard (Monday) morning. I don't think this 
is a group that will back it in, and as long as they don't quit, I have no 
reason to be discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping into the lane early on opponent free-throw attempts Thursday and 
Saturday nights hurt the Anteaters. Lane violations resulted in Long Beach 
State and UC Santa Barbara getting extra free throws. The 49ers got one point 
from the error and the Gauchos two. Both teams needed the points to send the 
games into overtime. "We never do that," Coach Rod Baker said. "You haven't 
seen us called for two lane violations in 2 1/2 years.". . . Irvine's No. 1 
doubles team of Chris Tontz and Fredrick Bach beat New Mexico's Roy Canada and 
Coulter Wright, the No. 7-ranked doubles team in the country.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: LATE STARTER NATOYA COMING ON STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Fullerton Coach Roger See talks about sophomore guard Bobby Natoya, he 
always mentions how hard Natoya works and how much determination he shows on 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Determination is the key word when it comes to understanding Natoya, 23, who 
got a late start in collegiate basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is making up for his late start. Natoya averaged 15 points last season 
and has a team-best 16-point average this season for Fullerton (20-7, 5-3 in 
conference). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ecstatic," Natoya said. "I love the coaches, the school and my teammates. 
I'm so excited to be playing. I just love being around the guys. I appreciate 
this maybe a little more than other people because of what it took for me to 
get here." 
</P>
<P>
 Natoya's twisted path to Fullerton started when he graduated from Sun Valley 
Poly High School in 1988. He then hoped to walk on at Cal State Northridge, but 
he was in a car accident that fall and couldn't play for almost two years while 
awaiting an insurance settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a fresh start, he enrolled at USC in the fall of 1990 and became 
friends with several players on the Trojan team. 
</P>
<P>
 He had hoped to walk on, but things didn't work out so he concentrated on 
classwork and played in pick-up games. He and current roommate Lorenzo Orr, a 
standout on the USC team, played together the last two summers in the Cal State 
Los Angeles summer league. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people encouraged Natoya to consider playing at the community college 
level and he contacted Tim Sweeney, an assistant now in his second year at 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Natoya was admittedly rusty for much of last season but started to feel better 
in the final weeks of the season. He was the Hornets' leading scorer in four of 
their final five games. 
</P>
<P>
 His best game came when Fullerton upset Cerritos, the second-seeded team in 
Southern California, in the opening round of the regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a team-high 25 points and made the game-winning three-pointer in the 
closing seconds of a 78-76 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," Natoya said. "Obviously it was the best win of my career. I 
told my teammates if it came down to one shot at the end that I wanted to take 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Natoya had such high expectations for this season that he pushed himself too 
hard in early-season workouts and hurt his back. He missed six games and had 
limited playing time in several others. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he is nearly at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love to compete," he said. "My dad and the rest of the family have 
supported me so much." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Game of the season: Riverside (21-5) travels to Saddleback (17-6) this week 
for the most important Orange Empire Conference game so far this season. The 
teams, tied for first in conference with 7-1 records, will play at 7 p.m. 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos, and especially guard Tes Whitlock, are playing very well. 
Whitlock scored 75 points in two games last week. Saddleback has won six in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock, a sophomore guard, averaged 32 points in his last four games and has 
an overall average of 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside features Darryle Flicking, a sophomore guard who is averaging 31 
points. The game also features two of the best point guards in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside's Raimonds Miglinieks leads the state with 12.5 assists. He is 
averaging 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Josh Borella, returning after a year off because of back surgery, 
is averaging six assists and 11 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's only conference loss was at Riverside, 91-78. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Helping out: The Fullerton baseball team is stepping in to provide some local 
earthquake relief this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 College of the Canyons in Valencia had several players whose homes were 
damaged in the recent earthquakes and the team wasn't sure it could play in 
this weekend's season-opening Fullerton/Cerritos tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a effort to ease traveling back and forth, Fullerton's players are 
going to take in Canyons' players for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty pumped when our kids said it would be no problem," Fullerton 
Coach Nick Fuscardo said. "We're not doing this to try and make ourselves look 
good. We just want to be there to help out anyway we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball season starts Friday with all six Orange County teams playing. 
Cypress takes on Cosumnes River at 6 p.m. in the College of the Desert 
tournament, San Bernardino Valley is at Fullerton at 10 a.m. and College of the 
Canyons plays Southwestern at 2 p.m., also at Fullerton in the opening round of 
the Fullerton/Cerritos tournament. Golden West battles Merced at 4 p.m. in the 
Fresno tournament, Orange Coast is at Citrus at 2 p.m. in the Citrus/Rio Hondo 
tournament, and East Los Angeles is at Rancho Santiago at 2 p.m. in the opening 
game of the South Bay Classic. Saddleback goes against Glendale at Palomar at 
1:30 p.m. in the first game of the Palomar tournament.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; FIVE SHADOWY LIVES REVOLVING AROUND SEX; LIFE & LOVE, SUCH 
AS THEY ARE, BY ANNA SHAPIRO SIMON & SCHUSTER, $21, 243 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What we have here, in this brittle novel of contemporary urban life, are five 
characters in search of a plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Former college friends, now in their early '30s -- Ella, Stephen, Cynthia, Ave 
and Burton -- live in each other's pockets; their hermetic little circle 
enlarged by Frank, an older, married photographer with whom Ella is having a 
passionate affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The adventure doesn't quite qualify as "mutual" adultery, because Ella isn't 
married to Stephen, although she's been living with him for almost 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen is a composer, presently at work on an innovative version of "Othello" 
to be called "Otella" and performed in drag. When we are finally treated to an 
account of this project, we learn that Desdemona has been renamed Desmond in 
order to set up a pun about "Desmond moaning." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps travesty might describe the venture more accurately, if less kindly. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton is also a musician, a conductor and the only character to have a day 
job practicing his art. Ella works part time at an advertising agency, although 
she fancies herself a serious painter. Her sole subject is the sky. Cynthia is 
an alcoholic, non-performing violinist with disabling but unspecified emotional 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Ave, the least sympathetic of the sorry lot, supports herself by dealing 
cocaine, a vocation that leaves her with more free time than the rest of the 
crew, proving the adage that the devil finds work for idle hands. Although 
Burton rather passively loves Cynthia, he's seduced by Ave, who treats him even 
more shabbily than Ella treats Stephen. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, Ella's married lover, is no bargain either. Meeting him at his squalid 
downtown studio, she notices his "scuttling walk," "big yellow teeth" and his 
resemblance to a popular movie personage known to be "cocksure, self-delighting 
and elusive." He's the ideal mate for the sluttish Ave, but unfortunately they 
never meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Anna Shapiro writes vividly and explicitly about sex, a lucky thing 
since her characters seem to have only the most shadowy lives once they're up 
and dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Without real jobs, with no family background or friends aside from one 
another, they inhabit a social and professional vacuum, essentially existing 
only in bed or in the various less comfortable places they choose for their 
sexual encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 When they're not so engaged, they're describing their experiences to the 
reader. Although the men are relatively taciturn, Ella, the chief spokesperson, 
makes up for everyone else's reticence. 
</P>
<P>
 The continual sexual activity gives the novel a curiously dated quality, as if 
it had been written in an earlier and more carefree decade, then put away to 
await a reversal of the counter-revolution, a turn-about that hasn't happened 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, Stephen and Burton, seem considerably more congenial than the 
women -- garrulous self-involved Ella, poor pathetic Cynthia and thoroughly 
despicable Ave. (Frank, who's merely peripheral, doesn't really count.) Still, 
that's not saying much. 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoned by Ella, Stephen finds a measure of consolation with a woman named 
Melody, who apparently appreciates the qualities Ella had disdained. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Burton was a pushover for the manipulative machinations of Ave, 
neglecting the desperately needy Cynthia, he doesn't deserve the dreadful 
punishment in store for him. Neither does Cynthia. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Life & Love, Such as They Are" is meant as a cautionary tale, the message 
is simply that life isn't fair. But most of us already know that. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the author has an agreeably tart wit and a highly developed sense of 
irony, she's expended her talent upon a set of characters who never deserve the 
attention lavished upon them.

 Read the label on an energy bar -- those healthy snacks designed to get you

performance, power and energy are plastered on the wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
 Long favored by endurance athletes (and touted by some big-name athletes), 
energy bars are also attracting everyday exercisers. That's partly due to a 
glut of new brands and strategic ads suggesting what's good for the elite might 
help the rest of us, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy bars can have a place in an exerciser's diet but can also be overkill, 
dietitians say. And there's nothing magical about them, the experts say. The 
same effect can be had with everyday foods, usually for less than the $1 to $2 
charged for most energy bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's some information to chew on before you face the smorgasbord of choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Solving the Taste Bud Problem: Palatability has been a sore point, even among 
dedicated energy-bar eaters -- who describe the taste as somewhere between 
cardboard and taffy gone bad. But that's passe, or so manufacturers claim, with 
a new emphasis on flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Formula: The common denominator for energy bars is a high-carbohydrate 
recipe that is low in fat to provide as much energy as possible. Fat intake 
should be kept to a minimum before exercise because it slows the transit time 
of food through the system, says Ellen Coleman, a Riverside dietitian and 
author of "Eating for Endurance."  
</P>
<P>
 Many energy bars get only about 8% to 10% of calories from fat, with the 
majority of calories from carbohydrates, followed by protein. Each bar is 
fortified with vitamins and minerals. The shelf life is six months or more.  
</P>
<P>
 The Market: In the past few years, several brands have debuted. Some have 
already come and gone. A sampling of what's still around: 
</P>
<P>
 * PowerBar, in four flavors. Apple-Cinnamon, for example, weighs 2.25 ounces, 
has 225 calories and two grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deer Valley McHenergy Bar, sold only by phone from Deer Valley Resort ((800) 
424-3337), weighs 2.5 ounces, has 260 calories and 1.4 grams of fat, pastry 
chef Letty Flatt says. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Clif (CQ) Bar, apricot variety, weighs 2.4 ounces, has 250 calories and 
no refined sugars, wheat or dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
 * FinHalsa weighs 1.7 ounces, has 170 calories and two grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trail Hiker, sold at ski resorts and by phone ((800) 234-7669), weighs 1.5 
ounces, has 110 calories and no fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Needs Them: Energy bars are ideal for exercisers involved in endurance 
activities, generally defined as an hour or more, Coleman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average Joe going out jogging four miles probably doesn't need these," 
adds Alicia Moag-Stahlberg, a Chicago dietitian and spokeswoman for the 
American Dietetic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The bars can come in handy, though, Coleman says, as convenient meal 
replacements if you are short of time. They can beat a fatty burger if you are 
trying to eat something before a workout.  
</P>
<P>
 When To Eat Them: Don't eat these bars too close to exercise time, or you may 
end up with less energy as your body works to digest them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's best to eat them 60 to 90 minutes before working out," says Martin 
Yadrick, a Manhattan Beach dietitian specializing in sports nutrition. "The 
more solid the bars are, and the more fiber, the longer before exercising you 
should eat them," he says. That will allow digestion to proceed so that once 
you begin exercising, blood flow can be diverted from your gut to your working 
muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman suggests one-hour eating intervals to replenish energy during an 
endurance activity. Suppose you are heading out for a three-hour bike ride? "At 
the end of the first hour, start eating a half-bar an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking water or sports drinks with the bars is highly recommended and is 
even advised on some labels to aid digestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Label Reading: Look for bars low in fat. And don't buy something that only 
looks like an energy bar. Some bars sold alongside energy bars are actually 
"nutrition bars," meant as healthier alternatives to candy bars, not 
pre-workout munchies. The fat grams are the clue: Some nutrition bars have 
seven grams of fat, but most energy bars have half that or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't buy an (energy) bar that has more than three grams of fat," 
Moag-Stahlberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatives: Other foods can help exercisers maintain energy through a 
workout and probably save money to boot, dietitians say. Good alternatives, 
Moag-Stahlberg says, are a banana, a bagel or both. Rice cakes, corn cakes or 
low-fat yogurt are other good choices, Coleman adds, along with "any food 
predominantly grain or fruit."

THEATER REVIEW; AN ENERGETIC 'SAYONARA'; THE TUNEFUL NEW MUSICAL BASED ON THE 
MICHENER BOOK HAS AN EAGERNESS TO ENTERTAIN. IT'S AT A CHEERFULLY REFURBISHED 
ALEX THEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be unfair to call "Sayonara" an old-fashioned musical. True, this is 
theway they used to write them during Broadway's Golden Age, a "book" musical 
with a bittersweet romantic story that isn't afraid to serve up a healthy 
number of laughs between the tears. What isn't old-fashioned at all in the 
current production at Glendale's newly refurbished Alex Theatre is the show's 
unabashed eagerness to entertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on James A. Michener's novel (not on the Brando film), the story is 
familiar enough. Maj. Lloyd (Ace) Gruver is stationed in occupied Japan in 1952 
and begins to find that his white-bread background is experiencing seismic 
quivers as his fellow conquering heroes discover the charms of the local women. 
</P>
<P>
 His friend Pvt. Joe Kelly is marrying his adoring Katsumi, and another pal, 
Capt. Mike Bailey, is almost as involved with Fumiko, an actress with the 
Takarazuka Theatre, where the shows are blatantly Westernized. It is Fumiko who 
introduces Gruver to the Number One Takarazuka Girl, Hana-Ogi, and sets the 
stage for the emotional turmoil that changes Gruver's life, and his heart. 
William Luce's book is about as honest as it can be in taking Michener's clues 
about the American racism in Japan at the time. Gruver's prospective 
father-in-law, the commanding officer, Gen. Webster, might be bent to sympathy 
if it weren't for the out-and-out bigotry of his wife, but his thinking is too 
close to hers, and regulations are on her side. 
</P>
<P>
 The heaviness of the plot is leavened with a tuneful score, with music by 
George Fischoff and lyrics by Hy Gilbert. If there is no memorably soaring 
ballad to hum on the way out, the romantic melodies have not only a flavor of 
the time but a sense of character and of the frustrations of the various 
star-crossed lovers. And the brightness of some of the character songs, 
particularly Kelly's exuberant "One Jump Ahead," gives the show contagious 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The present incarnation of "Sayonara" (an earlier form was seen at New 
Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse in 1987) began last year at Houston's Theatre 
Under the Stars, with the same Gruver and Hana-Ogi who give this production 
some of its best moments. Joseph Mahowald's commanding Maj. Gruver evolves 
imperceptibly from his slight starchiness at the beginning to the vulnerable 
warmth of his final moments with Hana-Ogi before they part. His rich baritone 
is perfectly matched to the gentle machismo of his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The many sides of Hana-Ogi, from Takarazuka male-impersonator to pliant but 
cautious lover, are treated like the shifting colors in a kaleidoscope in Sala 
Iwamatsu's performance -- now brash, now controlled. Director Philip Wm. 
McKinley has been with the show since its inception, and the cinematic flow of 
his staging never pauses. He knows when to bring it down to a walk, and when to 
let it run. It runs with an invigorating athleticism in the choreography by 
Tony Stevens, from jitterbugging servicemen to the Americanized revue material 
of the Takarazuka Girls, and Steven Smith's musical direction is bright and at 
times lilting. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael O'Steen is a buoyant and ingratiating Kelly, and the rough edge of 
Robert Patteri's Bailey is just right. Ako as Kelly's Katsumi and JoAnn M. 
Hunter as Bailey's Fumiko perfectly balance the energy of their G.I. Joes with 
charm and unpretentious humor. Tom Urich and Judith McCauley have the proper 
flavor of complacent bigotry as the Websters, and Frances Epsen is quietly 
elegant as their understanding daughter, whom Gruver deserts for this true 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Sherman's sets are lush when required, as are Jonathan Bixby's colorful 
costumes, and Kirk Bookman's lighting makes it all glow like musicals used to. 
The sound design of Francois Bergeron and Johnathan Deans sometimes allows the 
ensemble singing to muddle into unintelligibility and isn't too flattering to 
some of the female voices but treats the male voices with respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The refurbished Alex might also have a few solvable acoustical problems at the 
moment, but its face-lift is cheerful and comfortable, the sight lines are 
fine, and it seems the perfect home for the splashy entertainments it's 
designed to house. 
</P>

ART REVIEW; THE '60S WERE ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ROY LICHTENSTEIN'S SOBER 
CAREER; POP WAS JUST A PROLOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roy Lichtenstein was among a number of artists who playfully put the Pop in 
Pop art between 1961 and 1965. In the process, they swept away the pale 
doldrums into which third- and fourth-generation recapitulations of Abstract 
Expressionist painting had by then so dismally fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 What's interesting about the Lichtenstein retrospective that opened Sunday at 
the Museum of Contemporary Art is that this wildly inventive moment turns out 
to have been the prologue for a wry but nonetheless surprisingly sober career 
for the now 70-year-old artist. Don't be amazed if you leave the show firm in 
the conviction that Lichtenstein started out wildly Pop but soon settled into 
becoming a latter-day Neoclassical painter. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition at MOCA is considerably smaller than it was at its debut last 
fall at New York's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The 120 paintings originally 
displayed have been whittled to 81, the 23 sculptures to 10, the 10 drawings to 
none. With certain caveats, the show is stronger for the editing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the down side, only one of the important "brush-stroke" paintings begun in 
1965 is on view at MOCA; yet, these ironic paeons to the gorgeous slathers and 
drips of Abstract Expressionism form the clearest, most succinct summation of a 
central thread of Lichtenstein's art. Meanwhile, the strangely beautiful (and 
typically underestimated) pictures of the surfaces of mirrors are not shown to 
full advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, however, relatively few of the trims in the show date to the 
remarkable five-year period when Lichtenstein began to discover his artistic 
voice by adapting modern comic-strip style to the musty cliches of Abstract 
Expressionist rhetoric. Nearly half the paintings and sculptures in the 30-year 
retrospective date from 1961 to 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 While some great examples from those fecund years are sorely missed, the 43 on 
view make for an extraordinarily compelling array. "Look Mickey" (1961), 
Lichtenstein's first all-cartoon canvas, begins the survey with a pointed 
fusillade. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting uses its blunt, red-yellow-blue primaries to fashion a slyly 
hilarious riff on artistic solipsism. As Mickey Mouse looks on with bemusement, 
a typically wild-eyed Donald Duck raves hysterically about the giant fish he 
thinks he's caught on the other end of his tugging fish line. All the while, 
Donald is completely unaware that the whopper is in fact inside his own 
coattail, which he's neatly hooked behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 The reigning Expressionist faith in a self that can know only its own 
experiences, its own states of being, is given the boot in this surgically 
incisive image. The "big, American themes" grandly associated in the 1950s with 
the muscular, aggressive expanses of Abstract Expressionist painting here come 
apart at the seams, while the bigger, even more American theme of popular 
culture takes center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstraction, then acclaimed as the peak of a long, Modernist road to artistic 
heights, gives way to vintage Disney and the Sunday funnies. In a famous 
magazine article, the volatile Abstract Expressionist painters had been dubbed 
"The Irascibles," and who in the pop culture pantheon is more irascible than 
Donald Duck? 
</P>
<P>
 In the lexicon of traditional art, a cartoon is a spontaneous, preparatory 
study for a sleekly finished painting. It was the crudeness of such cartoons to 
which Impressionist canvases had been derisively compared nearly a century 
before, when a modern sensibility erupted. Lichtenstein, a mature 38 in 1961, 
was again restoring a sense of urgency to a contemporary artistic milieu gone 
stale and wan. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, Mickey! The usual claims for a primacy of feeling being more truly 
recorded in abstract rather than figurative art have gotten deliciously 
upended! 
</P>
<P>
 Like Andy Warhol, Lichtenstein surveyed the tired, restrictive and overworked 
terrain of American avant-garde art in his risible Pop paintings of the early 
'60s. In "Drowning Girl," a brunette goes under for the count, swirling in an 
abstract tidal-pool of paint. De Kooning's notorious pictures of women become 
comic-strip blonds, overcome with existential anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Painting as autobiography is shown as an unexpressive list of jottings in an 
ordinary appointment book. Elsewhere, the cover to a high school composition 
book recalls Pollock's dark, jagged gestures in black automobile paint. 
</P>
<P>
 In dazzling war-comic images of fighter planes, the battle over abstraction's 
stranglehold on contemporary art is addressed. "Okay, hot-shot, okay! I'm 
pouring!" screams a fighter pilot in a burst of machine-gun fire, wittily 
mowing down critic Clement Greenberg's contemporaneous dissertations, which 
promoted the so-called "poured abstractions" of Morris Louis and Helen 
Frankenthaler. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, once the battle was won and Pop art stood triumphant, 
Lichtenstein couldn't keep fighting a vanquished foe. His art wobbles a bit, 
especially in big, 1968 canvases based on Art Deco designs of the 1920s and 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Their significance lies primarily in focusing on the most popular American 
artistic style when mass culture was being born -- a style that lives on 
nostalgically today. Audience taste is their subject, while the relationship 
between audience and art is incisively (and melancholically) considered in 
Lichtenstein's next major body of work. 
</P>
<P>
 The mirror paintings (1969-71) apply mass-graphic style to effectively 
represent the shiny, silvered surfaces of variously shaped looking glasses. 
Their most disorienting quality is the utter absence of a reflected image. Like 
Dracula, you stand full-bodied before these Pop mirrors, yet you cannot see 
your apparently deadened, bloodless self. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and continuing to the present, Lichtenstein 
widened his scope from the urgent, Abstract Expressionist focus of his early 
work. All of Modern painting has since become grist for his image mill: 
Impressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, Surrealism -- these and more 
are quoted. 
</P>
<P>
 So is architecture, specifically the entablatures supported by columns on 
classical buildings. Lichtenstein's are pointedly Neoclassical, however, and 
therein lies a key to his post-Pop art. For just as Neoclassical artists of any 
revolutionary age -- including powerful moments in the 11th, 15th, 17th and 
19th centuries -- have built their work on classical foundations, so does he. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is that, for Lichtenstein, it is the classics of Modernism, not 
of antiquity, that are the columns holding up the entablature of his art. (In 
1988 he made a failed attempt to paint the Laocoon, the famous Roman copy of a 
1st-Century Greek sculpture beloved of the Renaissance; fortunately, it's not 
in the show.) Since at least 1972, his own "classic Pop" works of the '60s have 
also turned up as sources, represented within new paintings much the way 
Matisse showed his own paintings in the backgrounds of new work. 
</P>
<P>
 In moments of great upheaval, such as our own, Neoclassicism means to suggest 
a stable continuity with the past. By also showing how far we've come since 
then, the unique importance of the present is punctuated. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, when the distant mists of antiquity are replaced by the pressing 
realities of the modern world, as Lichtenstein has done, something else 
intrudes. A sobering sense that perhaps we haven't come so very far at all 
reverberates through this beautifully skeptical show.

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW; BIG FOR ITS AGE; TEEN SHADINGS ARE ADDED TO 'HOW TO 
EAT LIKE A CHILD,' BUT THERE ARE LAUGHS FOR LITTLE KIDS TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's evening. The house is quiet. The phone rings. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have children, you know what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't, here's a clue: Pandemonium. The baby shrieks, the 6-year-old 
pitches himself from the top bunk and the teen-agers, at the exact instant, 
experience raging hunger pangs and reach for the last Twinkie. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shouting reaches the next area code, you begin to ask yourself the 
eternal question: What is it that enables children who can't even agree on a 
television program to mount such a flawlessly synchronized attack without 
exchanging so much as a wink? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is simple. It's all in the handbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Delia Ephron's "How to Eat Like a Child" is about as close to that handbook as 
most adults will ever get. Ephron's book has been adapted into a series of 
comic musical sketches, currently being staged by the Depot Theatre Young 
Actor's Company. At last Sunday's performance at the Depot Theatre, the show 
drew a steady stream of yuks from kids and an equal number of wry (or were 
those pained?) chuckles from adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute show, directed by Jack Millis, features sketches with such 
titles as "How to Play" and "How to Act After Being Sent to Your Room." The 
script by Ephron, John Forster and Judith Kahan seems to draw most of its 
inspiration from the grade-school set. So, it took some time to adjust to the 
ages of many of the cast members (the range was from 10- to 19-year-olds, but 
the majority looked to be from the mid- and upper end of that). 
</P>
<P>
 Millis has attempted to incorporate that by adding some teen-age shadings to 
the vignettes. A primer on how to eat mashed potatoes was framed in a "Wayne's 
World"-style talk show hosted by a totally tubular pair, and in a scene 
entitled "How to Practice the Violin," the unwilling student fantasized about a 
12-string Rickenbackers and Pearl Jam (" That's music"). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, these and other attempts to raise the hipness level of the 
show worked well. Some didn't. The beatnik-ish "How to Express an Opinion" fell 
flat, as did a segment on lunchroom presented a la "The Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Other sketches that borrowed from popular genres with greater success included 
"How to Beg for a Dog," which features a vaudeville song and dance complete 
with straw skimmers and some of Forster's wittiest lyrics, and "How to 
Understand Parents," which gave basic translations of adult conversation 
(everything means "No") in a "Les Miserables"-style musical setting. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scenes that were probably the most enjoyable were the ones that more 
or less played it straight, pandering neither to the kids nor the adults. 
Topping that list was "How to Behave in School" (prop Mad magazine inside 
Language Arts book, laugh hysterically. When teacher notices, mumble 
appreciatively, "Oh, that Tolstoy!") 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every member of the "How to Eat" cast has put in some time on the 
boards, and it shows. Strengths varied: Some cast members were better singers 
than actors, others the opposite. A few, such as Joe Alfred Lopez Jr. and Clark 
Damico -- the pair featured in "How to Beg for a Dog" -- were noteworthy in 
both arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Anne Brennan and Josh Shade played off each other nicely in several 
sketches as sparring siblings. Summer Wybaczynskeythe proud owner of one of the 
most malleable faces since Soupy Sales as well as a fairly impressive set of 
pipes, was a hoot as she asked the musical question, "Why Should a Kid Have to 
Walk?" 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows, kiddo? Better check the handbook.

 Spanish Opera House Burns: Fire destroyed Spain's leading opera house, the 
146-year-old Gran Teatre del Liceu, on Monday. The cause of the blaze on 
Barcelona's picturesque Ramblas Boulevard had not been determined. It broke out 
shortly after 11 a.m. behind the theater's stage and within an hour had spread 
through the building, causing much of the roof to collapse. Jordi Pujol, head 
of the Catalonia regional government, said the theater would be rebuilt 
immediately. The city and regional government had been planning to begin a 
$28-million, two-year restoration of the theater later this year.

 * 'Tommy' to Play Universal: The touring production of "The Who's Tommy" will 
play the Universal Amphitheatre for at least three weeks beginning July 13. 
Acoustic walls will narrow the sides of the seating area, reducing capacity 
from 6,251 to 3,801 in an attempt to improve sight-lines, and the stage will be 
extended backward to create space for the show's elaborate set and projection 
equipment. Although the show has been announced as playing only through July 
31, a three-week extension is possible. As previously announced, the tour also 
is slated for the McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert April 28-May 1 and the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center May 10-15. COMEDY

 * Casting Call: 20th Century Fox is looking for the next Natalie Wood. Fox, 
along with writer-producer John Hughes, will hold a seven-city open casting 
call on Saturday to find a 6-year-old star for the studio's remake of the 1947 
holiday classic "Miracle on 34th Street." "We're considering both boys and 
girls to portray the character . . . and we're opening the auditions up to kids 
with or without acting experience," said Hughes. "What we'll be hoping to find 
is that magical quality of humor and innocence that helped to make the original 
'Miracle on 34th Street' a classic." Hopeful stage mothers will have to take 
their wards to Houston, Dallas, Seattle, New York, Chicago, Orlando or 
Minneapolis for an audition -- no open casting call is scheduled for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>

 * Casting Call, Part II: An open casting call will be held at Melrose Avenue's 
Raleigh Studios Wednesday for "9021-Zero -- The Movie," a film parody of the 
Fox TV series "Beverly Hills, 90210." The Tomorrow's Girl project, which is 
scheduled to start production in April, follows the publicity surrounding the 
lives of Duke Cherry, Jace Popely, Torny Reading, Wennie Girth, Byron Justin 
Chartreuse, Lian Hering and Giselle Cataract as they react to their volatile 
co-star, Dannen Doberman. Look-alikes of the TV stars are requested. QUICK

THEATER REVIEW; POIGNANCY OF PARENTAL LOVE SUMS UP 'THE SUM'; NORTH COAST 
REPERTORY PRESENTS WITH SENSITIVITY AND STYLE THE STORY OF A MAN HELPING HIS 
SON FIND MR. RIGHT.

 North Coast Repertory Theatre, which was staging such works as "Torch Song 
Trilogy" and "The Normal Heart" when gay themes still took patrons by surprise, 
is offering "The Sum of Us," a 1991 Obie-winner by David Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 In this simple, tender and often witty drama about a widowed Australian and 
his gay son, the conflict is not about sexuality, and no one gets AIDS. What 
drives the story is the father's determination that Jeff be happy, and if that 
means helping him find a "cheerful" mate (Dad dislikes the word "gay"), Dad 
will do whatever it takes -- from cruising gay bars with Jeff to bringing home 
gay magazines to serving Jeff's overnight guests tea in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Which really freaks out the overnight guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sum of Us" is not a major play with great implications. Its significance 
derives from the very ordinariness of its skillfully written characters. The 
gay son is not brilliant, rich, famous or wildly charismatic. He's a plumber 
whose big dream is that the nice young gardener he meets in a pub will turn out 
to be Mr. Right. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosina Widdowson-Reynolds directs with sensitivity and style, eliciting a 
particularly lovely and fluid performance as Jeff from newcomer Kevin Patrick 
Walls, whose quiet agony as a nice but lonely, less-than-forceful guy touches 
the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Rose sets down a solid anchor as Harry, the unwaveringly supportive if 
slightly smothering father, though he clearly is better portraying extremes of 
love and exasperation than finer shades of feeling. In more simply drawn roles, 
J.D. Meier makes a credibly confused Greg, Jeff's unsure gardener, and Wendy 
Cullum is appropriately stiff and repressed as Joyce, a woman Harry woos only 
to find that she can't accept his son's homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The design details, from Marty Burnett's unfussy working class set to the 
costumes by Sue Schaffner and Widdowson-Reynolds, fit the piece snugly without 
adding or taking away very much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the play is small in scope, more could be plumbed from it. Stevens 
writes segments during which his characters talk to the audience; these could 
be more cleanly demarcated. And there is a sub-story about the father's mother, 
who took a female lover after her husband died; this floats a suggestion -- not 
fully nailed down in this production -- that the father feels guilty about 
having separated his mother from her true love, a mistake he doesn't want to 
repeat with his son. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are minor flaws in a show that overall is a pleasurably funny, 
poignant look at real life in the '90s -- at once true to its gay subject 
matter and to the universal issue of parental love, its grand possibilities and 
its often painful limitations.

MUSIC REVIEW; A GLORIOUS STERN RECITAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At 73, Isaac Stern might be forgiven for packing it in and resting on his 
laurels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might even encourage him to do so. The faults in his playing are obvious. 
His tone is small, wiry, and, occasionally, whiny. His intonation is sometimes 
off, at times considerably. His fingers do not move as easily as they once did. 
Violinists, unlike pianists, cannot go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every fault on display, there were 100 things he did right. That still 
puts him considerably ahead of most of his younger colleagues. His recital 
Sunday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, with pianist Yefim Bronfman in 
partnership, was, in a word, glorious. In four words, elegant, probing, 
communicative and wise. 
</P>
<P>
 One would guess that Stern hears what we hear. He knows his technique has 
faded. He knows his limitations -- and he works with them, not against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Mozart sonatas, K. 377 in F and K. 481 in E-flat, opened the concert. 
Stern presented them within a tiny framework of sound, avoiding pressing his 
tone beyond its limits, relying on lightness of touch. The details within that 
framework, however, were many and pointed. 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed to weigh every phrase thoughtfully -- gently shading and emphasizing 
curves, varying articulation -- and then place them in the overall context with 
the skill of a philosopher. The two slow movements emerged in all of their 
emotional scope, and he made his points by pulling back, by bringing the 
listener to him. 
</P>
<P>
 He lightly sketched in the charms of Schubert's G-minor Sonatina as well, 
finding, in the process, what seemed the perfect tempos for the composer's 
tuneful thoughts to breathe and glow. Bronfman, with the piano lid fully open, 
never overpowered the violinist's slender tone and yet projected an array of 
color, touch and feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have appeared, however, that Cesar Franck's demanding, richly 
perfumed and grandly rhetorical Sonata in A would be too much for Stern's 
fragile technique. But, again, he did the smart thing by not asking himself to 
do what he couldn't, and by capturing the breadth of phrase and heated impulses 
with urgent, supple restraint. In doing so, with Bronfman offering a rich 
backdrop for the violinist to work in, he revealed how simple the beauties of 
this work really are. 
</P>
<P>
 The faults? Mere technicalities.

 BLACK HISTORY: The city of Port Hueneme, which has the largest percentage of 
African Americans in Ventura County, has been hosting a photo exhibition 
depicting the history of the black community as a prelude to Black History 
Month. . . . "We've had a lot of people come in just to look at it," said Sara 
Ellinwood, of the Ray D. Prueter Library. . . . Black History Month starts 
today, and the library will display a collection of old photos from Oxnard 
resident Ira Mae Verrett. 
</P>
<P>
 DRY SPELL?: Weather watchers have marked the end of another month with 
below-average rainfall (B1), raising fears that the county may be entering 
another dry period. . . . Rainfall totals countywide measured only 36% of 
normal, and no rain is on the horizon at least through Sunday. "It's not as bad 
as the worst," state hydrologist Maurice Roos said, "but it would sure be nice 
if it were better." 
</P>
<P>
 RADAR WARS: Opponents of a microwave radar tower have taken their fight to the 
airwaves. Ojai residents, joined by Rep. Elton Gallegly, are scheduled to tape 
an episode of the "Montel Williams Show" today. . . . "We want no radiation 
without representation," said David Hedman, a spokesman for the group that has 
sued the federal government to prevent a 98-foot weather-tracking station from 
being switched on. . . . The daytime talk show apparently has found fertile 
ground in Ventura County. Williams did a segment last month on twin brothers 
from Oxnard who traded places in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 QUIET COMPETITION: Borla Performance Industries is making a lot of noise in 
the Japanese muffler market (Valley Business, Page 10). . . . The Oxnard 
company, which markets a line of stainless-steel exhaust systems, introduced 
its first product for the Japanese at a Tokyo auto show last month. . . . 
"We're riding the wave of American automobiles that are winding up in Japan," 
company President Alexander Borla said. African Americans

 BO'S SKY: Bo Jackson, the newest member of the California Angels (C1), 
apparently has found a new hobby. He already has conquered football, winning 
the Heisman Trophy at Auburn before becoming an All-Pro running back for the 
Raiders. He has mastered baseball, making the All-Star team in 1989. And now? . 
. . "I'd still like to be a military pilot," Jackson confided. "In fact, I'm 
going to go up with the Blue Angels in three days. I'm going up in that 
beautiful blue sky. Believe me, that's living." 
</P>
<P>
 BO'S HOUSE? Jackson already knows how to hit home runs at Anaheim Stadium. It 
was his first-inning homer at the Big A in the 1989 All-Star game there that 
made him the game's most valuable player and elevated his endorsement dollars. 
That was all before his artificial hip operation, but Jackson exudes 
confidence: "The ball travels very well in this ballpark. I like that. Whenever 
I'm in the lineup, I'll try to make things happen."

 HOME REMINDER: Costa Mesa photographer Pascal Tran, 32, recently took his 
cameras back to Vietnam, his first return since moving here as a teen-ager. He 
took 4,000 pictures, which he's turned into a slide show aimed at other 
Vietnamese Americans. It will be shown repeatedly during the 12th annual Tet 
Festival at Golden West College in Huntington Beach this weekend. . . . "Many 
of us don't remember Vietnam because we are so young," Tran says. "I just want 
to remind them what our country is like."

 FAMILY SUPPORT: Three men accused of killing Amy Biehl of Newport Beach when 
she was working in South Africa last August saw two unexpected faces at their 
trial in Cape Town on Monday: Amy's sister Molly, and her mother, Linda Biehl. 
. . . The two decided to attend after reading that some witnesses were being 
intimidated. Says Linda Biehl: "We are Amy's family, and if it had happened in 
the U.S., we would have been at the trial. It may help us get through this."

WITNESSES SAY BECKWITH BRAGGED OF KILLING EVERS; COURT: SUSPECT ON TRIAL FOR 
THE THIRD TIME IN THE 1963 SLAYING PURPORTEDLY REFERRED TO THE BLACK CIVIL 
RIGHTS LEADER AS A 'CHICKEN-STEALING DOG.'

<P>
 Byron De La Beckwith bragged on two occasions that he had killed civil rights 
leader Medgar Evers, whom he called a "chicken-stealing dog," witnesses at his 
murder trial testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a man he killed, it was a damn chicken-stealing dog, and you know 
what you have to do to a dog after he's tasted blood," Mary Ann Adams said 
Beckwith told her in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Prince, who rented an apartment from Beckwith in Tennessee in 1986 and 
1987, said Beckwith used a racial slur when referring to Evers and the trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I had a job to do and I did it, and I didn't suffer any more than 
your wife if she was going to have a baby,' " Prince told the jury in Hinds 
County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith was tried twice in 1964 for the murder of Evers, who headed the 
Mississippi NAACP from 1954 until his slaying on June 12, 1963. Both trials 
ended in hung juries. 
</P>
<P>
 New evidence enabled prosecutors to reopen the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, a bookkeeper, said Beckwith was introduced to her as Evers' killer when 
she and a co-worker ran into him at a restaurant in Greenwood in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was introduced to him as 'Byron De La Beckwith, the man who killed Medgar 
Evers,' " she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refused to shake his hand, said I wouldn't shake the hand of a murderer. He 
got extremely agitated." 
</P>
<P>
 That was when he made the remark about killing a dog, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams admitted that she hadn't told authorities about the remark for 14 years. 
She said she had assumed that Beckwith couldn't be tried again. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys tried to undermine Prince's testimony by revealing that he 
had been evicted from Beckwith's rental apartment. The reason for the eviction 
wasn't disclosed, however.

 "This time," Judy Horn said, "our dogs alerted us." 
</P>
<P>
 Holly, usually a picture of calm, grew nervous. After the 3.8 aftershock hit 
early Saturday morning, the black Lab forced her way into Judy's room. Soon 
Judy was up feeding biscuits to Holly, Rex and the chronically skittish Butch. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Judy decided to check on her ailing husband. She was at Bob's side when 
the 5.0 aftershock hit at 3:20 a.m., centered just a few miles north of their 
Winnetka home. 
</P>
<P>
 With one hand, Judy held on to Bob. With the other, she held on to his 
mechanical lung. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's been two weeks and a day since the 6.6 haymaker sent us reeling. True, we 
don't know when the aftershocks will end. But as I took my own secret shortcut 
to work Monday, it was good to see that some of the fallen block walls were 
being rebuilt. Slowly, life seems to be returning to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 This also seems true for the Horn family -- and normal for them is 
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers may recall Bob and Judy Horn. Bob is a former Cal State Northridge 
political science professor who five years ago was stricken with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS). Now virtually paralyzed by the disease, Horn survives 
with the aid of a ventilator -- a battery-powered box that feeds air to his 
windpipe through a plastic tube. Although his body has failed him, Prof. Horn 
still displays a sharp mind and an active wit with the help of a specially 
rigged computer or the coded movements of his eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Jan. 17 quake was frightening for you, imagine what it was like for the 
immobile Bob Horn, whose mechanical lung was pitched to the floor and damaged. 
Imagine what it was like for Judy as she heard the ventilator alarm, signaling 
that Bob wasn't getting any air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I had time to go into the apprehension and fear," Judy says, 
"because I had so much to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy and Bob, fortunately, weren't alone. Their 22-year-old son, Chris, was at 
home, as was a nursing attendant. So was Judy's 77-year-old mother, Marion, 
who'd shuffled in from the cold of Buffalo, N. Y., for a visit, only to come 
down with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 The others made it through the quake without harm. They focused their 
attention on Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 First they disconnected Bob's broken "vent" and hooked up a device known as an 
"ambu bag" -- a manually operated device that pumps air into his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't the only concern. Earlier that week, Bob had developed a bronchial 
infection that required the suctioning of fluids from his throat. With the 
power knocked out by the earthquake, they resorted to a portable, 
battery-powered suction device that provided only minimal help. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob's breathing became so difficult that Judy hooked up the device to an 
oxygen tank. For close to an hour, Chris used the "ambu bag" to keep his father 
alive. Judy dug through the books and memorabilia that had fallen in the den to 
retrieve Bob's wheelchair, with the portable ventilator attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris tried to explain his father's ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's helpless all the time," Chris said. "And when you run into something 
like an earthquake, when people who are not sick are helpless, it magnifies his 
helpless feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared. My mom was scared. But that has to be shoved aside to make sure 
he gets through it. . . . It was amazing what my mom was able to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends pitched in as well. A neighbor shut off the gas line. Mario Hernandez, 
a nursing assistant who has been with the Horns for three years, left his own 
damaged apartment in Reseda to check on the Horns. Chris' friend Ben Turner 
also showed up. Together, Chris and Ben were able to lift Bob into his 
wheelchair and place him in the van for a trip to the hospital, Humana West 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Horn has nothing but praise for how the hospital's doctors, nurses and 
attendants reacted to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bob in the hospital, the Horns turned to chores at home. Broken pipes had 
flooded part of the house. A block wall was down in the back yard. Like so many 
people in the Valley, they were living without power, gas and water service. 
"We're really, really lucky," Chris said. "There are people a lot worse off 
than we are."

 Judy's mother, who had always said she hoped to experience an earthquake on a 
California visit, headed home with a heck of a story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, 11 days after the 6.6 quake hit, Bob came home from the hospital 
-- just in time for a big aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy says they've learned a few lessons. Now Bob's ventilator is strapped to 
the table by a bungee cord. And his portable ventilator is close at hand. 
</P>

<P>
 Judy Horn tends to focus on the silver linings. One of the nice things about 
the Northridge earthquake, she says, is that old friends from all over the 
world have checked in to see how they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, these calls have a certain poignancy. The other day, the Horns 
received a call from one of Bob's old frat brothers. They'd been out of touch 
for such a long time that he wasn't aware of Bob's illness. 
</P>
<P>
 But this friend, and all the others, would be happy to know that Bob's wit 
survived the quake just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking with eyebrows, Bob says there is only one reason he went to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't deal with the cleanup."

GIVING UP THE SHIP; CHEVRON'S LOCAL TANKER BUSINESS HALTED BY A MISSED DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chevron Corp., which fought a decade-long battle to ship oil by tanker through 
the Santa Barbara Channel, will cease shipping operations today after failing 
to secure a deal with a pipeline company to move oil after its shipping permit 
expires in 1996, according to public and company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its California Coastal Commission permit, Chevron had until today to 
line up a permanent pipeline to move the crude being pumped from its massive 
Point Arguello offshore fields to refineries in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such an agreement in place, the company must cease shipping operations 
immediately, state and local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Chevron has applied for an emergency permit to continue using 
tankers because the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged a portion of a pipeline used to 
transport about half of the crude produced at the company's Point Arguello 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company normally moves about 40,000 barrels of oil a day on that Four 
Corners pipeline, which runs from northern Santa Barbara County to Bakersfield 
and then on to Los Angeles refineries. With the damage, Chevron has been forced 
to reroute the oil, slow production and place excess crude oil in storage 
tanks, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron's failure to sign a pipeline agreement also threatens its right to use 
the marine terminal at Gaviota for loading tankers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State Lands Commission officials said Monday that its lease agreement with 
Chevron for use of the offshore terminal was also contingent upon the company 
finalizing a pipeline agreement by today. 
</P>
<P>
 "After midnight tonight, Chevron must stop tankering," Jim Trout, assistant 
executive officer of the State Lands Commission, said Monday. "So far, we have 
not officially heard from the company. And at this point, it would be very hard 
for this agency to justify this situation as an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron spokesman G. Michael Marcy said the company was unsuccessful in its 
efforts to reach a deal with Huntington Beach-based Cajon Pipeline Co., which 
will soon start construction of a pipeline from the Barstow area to Los 
Angeles. Negotiations with the company broke off in late December. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy said Chevron backed out of the deal because the two companies could not 
agree to terms and the oil company did not like the route of the proposed 
pipeline. Chevron officials instead have opted to pursue development of the 
Pacific Pipeline, an oil conduit that is proposed to run directly south from 
Kern County to the company's Los Angeles-area refineries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cajon pipeline is not as commercially viable as we would like," Marcy 
said. "We had high hopes that we would reach a deal, but in the end could not 
agree. That's business. We're not going to be pushed into a deal just because 
(Cajon officials) may have their construction permits in hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday morning, the Chevron tanker Oregon eased away from its moorings 
at Gaviota loaded with an estimated 250,000 barrels of oil and headed south 
toward Los Angeles. It could be the company's last tanker load unless Santa 
Barbara County officials approve the company's request for an emergency 
shipping permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's voyage was Chevron's 17th since getting the permit in January, 1993, 
from the Coastal Commission following a bruising 10-year battle with county and 
state regulators and local environmentalists. Chevron and its partners have 
sunk an estimated $2.6 billion into the Point Arguello project. The offshore 
field contains an estimated 300 million to 600 million barrels of oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to accept our bitter medicine on this one," Marcy said. "Obviously, 
we are not going to meet our deadline and tankering operations will cease 
effective Feb. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Douros, deputy director of the energy division for Santa Barbara County, 
said county officials are considering Chevron's emergency shipping request. He 
said a decision may be reached as early as Wednesday. Chevron asked the county 
to allow it to use tankers to ship up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day until the 
Four Corners pipeline is repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking over their request and considering whether or not an emergency 
truly exists," Douros said. "We want to determine the exact extent of the 
damages to the line and find out when it is expected to be back on line." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also investigating Chevron and its corporate partners' ability 
to store oil until the Four Corners pipeline resumes operation. The companies 
involved in the Point Arguello project now can store about 800,000 barrels of 
crude. About 80,000 barrels a day is produced from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda Krop, an attorney with the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense 
Center, said Chevron's request for an emergency shipping permit and the 
company's inability to secure a deal with a pipeline company were examples of 
its intent to continue to rely upon tanker shipping instead of pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our belief that Chevron never intended to use the Cajon line and in fact 
hoped to use a failed deal with them as a reason for the Coastal Commission to 
grant an extension on their tankering permit," Krop said. "We hope that when 
officials examine the situation, Chevron's plans will backfire." 
</P>
<P>
 Krop discounted Chevron's suggestion that the Four Corners pipeline system was 
so seriously damaged as to prevent Chevron's use. Even if the pipeline is 
inoperative, Chevron's own oil storage units and the temporary use of other 
pipelines could be substituted until repairs on the Four Corners lines are 
completed, she said.

NEW METROLINK STATION WILL OPEN FEB. 14 IN CAMARILLO; TRANSPORTATION: METROLINK 
SITE WOULD PROVIDE 2 ROUND-TRIPS DAILY, EASING POST-EARTHQUAKE COMMUTING. THE 
DEBATE CONTINUES OVER ITS FINANCING, HOWEVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Metrolink station that would provide bare-bones service from Camarillo to 
Los Angeles is scheduled to open in two weeks, helping to ease post-earthquake 
commutes, transportation officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Metrolink and the Ventura County Transportation Commission 
pledged to start the service on Feb. 14 with two round-trip trains per day, 
despite growing confusion about how construction and operation of the station 
will be financed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, officials announced plans to extend Metrolink to 
Camarillo, intending to fund the year-long extension exclusively with up to 
$900,000 in disaster relief funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials from Metrolink and the Transportation Commission spent most of 
last week haggling over a range of station plans, with local officials favoring 
the scrappy slab of asphalt with a dirt parking lot originally discussed and 
Metrolink officials proposing a sleek, multimillion-dollar facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Those discussions are continuing, but officials said several options will be 
presented to the Transportation Commission at its 10:30 a.m. Friday meeting at 
Camarillo City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Commissioner Bill Davis said he still favors the original, 
bare-bones proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't need right now is a state-of-the-art station with a slew of new 
engines and cars," he said. "What we do need is to get some emergency service 
up and running as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The no-frills station envisioned by Davis and other officials would include a 
lighted platform and parking lot for 240 cars. It would lack the automated 
ticket machines, benches and awnings found at the Simi Valley and Moorpark 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 And under that option, Camarillo would have only two trains heading to Los 
Angeles in the morning and two returning at night. Officials originally had 
envisioned five round-trip trains per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a stripped-down station and two trains daily, the Transportation 
Commission will probably have to pay some of the costs of serving Camarillo, 
officials now say. The commission gets its money from state transportation 
funds and county subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the transportation commissioners on Monday, commission Executive 
Director Ginger Gherardi said the agency should be willing to pay "our share of 
the costs" -- up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials said they are confident that FEMA will pay as much as 
$900,000 to extend the service. But Gherardi said in her memo that if the 
agency turns down the county's application, the commission will be liable for 
the full cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials said that although they have proposed a range of station 
possibilities, they are willing to build whatever Ventura County wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink Regional Coordinator Adrienne Brooks-Taylor said the estimated cost 
for extending service to Camarillo could run as high as $2.5 million, depending 
on the type of station. But by cutting corners, costs could be reduced 
dramatically, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the commission decides to spend only $900,000, "we will go ahead with 
plans for the station in Camarillo," Brooks-Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Metrolink has opened four emergency stations in the Antelope Valley 
and one in the San Fernando Valley since the quake, no estimates are available 
on the cost of those stations, Brooks-Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working so fast, pulling everything together on an emergency 
basis, that we're just now breaking down the cost."

LARGE HOTEL-CASINO PROPOSED FOR OXNARD; GAMING: RETIRED CAMARILLO BUSINESSMAN 
WANTS TO OFFER GAMBLING AT REGIONAL CONVENTION CENTER. BUT CITY COUNCIL 
REJECTED A CARD HOUSE PLAN LAST YEAR, AND KEY OFFICIALS ARE STILL OPPOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven months after the City Council derailed plans to open a major card house, 
a former union organizer and restaurateur is floating a proposal for a regional 
hotel-casino before Oxnard officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Bokron, a 71-year-old retired businessman living in Camarillo, said 
Monday that he is putting together plans to bring big-dollar gambling to Oxnard 
in the form of a sprawling hotel-convention center casino that he said could 
come before the City Council as soon as this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting the plan by the Oxnard City Council or residents will not be easy. 
Several key city and county officials said Monday they still oppose large-scale 
gambling and the criminal element that often accompanies it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city received about 2,000 letters specifically opposed to card 
casinos -- outnumbering those who favored the proposal 20 to 1, according to 
the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public doesn't want a card club in Oxnard," Councilman Michael A. Plisky 
said Monday. "That was made perfectly clear." 
</P>
<P>
 The gambling project was denied in June after hundreds of residents jammed the 
council chambers to oppose the plan. That same night, Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury announced a probe into a money-laundering and political corruption 
scheme he associated with the casino gambling project. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men involved last summer in proposing a casino were charged in October 
with money laundering by making illegal donations to local campaigns. That 
criminal case is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Marasco, 48, of Ventura and Michael E. Wooten, 45, of Camarillo, who 
co-owned the now-defunct Darrik Marten Co., were charged with six misdemeanors 
each for allegedly making about $1,000 in illegal campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial is scheduled Feb. 22 in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky's 1992 mayoral campaign was one of four local elections that the 
district attorney's office said received illegal contributions. Plisky said the 
hotel and convention center proposals do not detract from the influences 
24-hour gambling would bring to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect all the rest of that stuff is just window dressing to get the card 
club approved," said Plisky, who prosecutors said was unaware of the allegedly 
illegal contributions made to his campaign. "We've got hotels now that are 
barely making ends meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said Monday that he too would have a hard time 
approving any legalized gambling in his city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally do not believe in gambling," Lopez said. "As to a specific 
proposal, I think I would have to reserve judgment on it. But the gambling 
aspect of it, I don't think I could support." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Bokron's project meets the approval of the City Council later this 
year, the Ventura County district's attorney's office maintains that it would 
also require the approval of Oxnard voters to open a casino of that scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The addition of a hotel has no impact on our opinion regarding card club 
casinos," Special Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald D. Coleman said Monday. "They are 
of questionable validity to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the district attorney and California Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren said 
that under existing law, any card house in Oxnard would have to be approved by 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that opinion, however, Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig has said the 
council could approve a card club without voters' consent because the city 
allowed gambling before the gaming law went into effect 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gillig was not available to comment on Monday, and his assistant Paula 
Kimbrell declined to comment. But Gillig has maintained that he stands by his 
interpretation of the 1984 state gaming law. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman refused to say whether the district attorney's office would file a 
legal challenge to any approval of a card club by the City Council. But he did 
say "the city would be inviting litigation on the matter" by allowing one. 
</P>
<P>
 Bokron is a longtime businessman who has managed or owned a series of 
restaurants in the Oxnard area for many years. Prior to that, he spent several 
years working as an organizer for the culinary workers union before going into 
business for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the Old Timer restaurant in downtown Oxnard decades ago, and later 
moved it to the Wagon Wheel center before closing it in 1989. Bokron also ran 
the Golden Dolphin restaurant in the Channel Islands Harbor in the early 1980s 
before it went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of Bokron's hotel-casino plan comes seven months after 
council members voted unanimously to deny another proposal that would have 
established Oxnard as a destination for big-time gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bokron said the posh hotel-casino development would rival vacation resorts in 
Los Angeles and Nevada by offering a 164-room hotel, a 5,000-seat theater and 
dozens of specialty shops and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should hang a sign over the freeway that says, 'Oxnard: The Biggest 
Little City in California,' " Bokron said, in a reference to Reno, Nev. 
"Because that's what it will be eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 Bokron envisions an expansive center that would house not only a card 
club-casino of 45 to 75 tables, but also offer guests everything from fine 
dining and entertainment to first-class accommodations and convention 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you're in that complex, you'd have no reason to go out," Bokron said. 
"There's places to sleep, places to eat, entertainment. You name it, it's 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Chamber of Commerce last year endorsed the concept of pursuing a 
gambling casino for the city in a split decision, but Executive Director Penny 
Hoffman said Monday that she did not have enough information to support 
Bokron's project. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant working for Bokron said the hotel and casino would generate about 
1,200 jobs and substantial taxes for Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be revenue coming in that this city needs," said Mary 
Pallais of Pallais & Associates of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pallais, the latest project is being touted by local business 
people with local ties and local reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people involved are long-term residents of the county who have high 
morals," she said. "People know them. It's not just a card room. We're looking 
to bring in the tourist trade." 
</P>
<P>
 But that contention does not sway Jeffrey Brown, a local stockbroker who last 
year opposed high-stakes gambling in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's enough negative fallout that (the hotel-convention center) doesn't 
provide an offsetting benefit," Brown said. "We don't need gambling here. What 
we need is industry that would promote good jobs, manufacturing jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The minister of the First Presbyterian Church of Oxnard, who vocally opposed 
legalized gambling before the City Council last summer, said a hotel-casino 
would do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tempts people to spend money on gambling that probably is needed for 
basics," said the Rev. James Bain. "You would have a lot of families hurt, and 
it would hurt the image of Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the applicants behind one of last year's card house proposal said 
Monday that if the City Council is now leaning toward endorsing gambling in the 
city, it should hear other offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's going to be reconsidered, they should open it up for everyone," said 
Wooten, one of the former card house promoters now facing misdemeanor charges 
in the contribution-laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a proposal intended to bring gaming to Oxnard," said Wooten, who also 
is an attorney. "It's being dressed up with a hotel and convention center, but 
the issue is still the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the slew of opposition the other card house proposals met last year, 
Bokron remains confident his project will meet the approval of residents and 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are 50,000 more people out there that are for it," he said.

HOPEFULS SPENT $222,000 IN VENTURA COUNCIL RACE, AMONG CITY'S COSTLIEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At least $222,000 was funneled into last year's Ventura City Council race, one 
of the costliest elections in Ventura history. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, pro-business candidates spent the larger amounts of money in the 
race. Unlike recent elections in which political action groups helped pump a 
lot of cash into the contest, most of the funds in last year's council race 
came from fund-raising events candidates held on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, the top vote-getter in November's council 
race, took in and spent the most money, according to financial disclosure forms 
filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures, 56, is a former banker who currently manages her family's trust 
fund. She spent $35,884 on her campaign, which included a loan of $6,000 from 
her trust fund and her husband's trust. Her campaign funds came from a variety 
of sources, including local businesses and developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Bennett, a Nordhoff High School teacher who pledged not to 
accept donations of more than $100, spent $21,487 for his second-place finish. 
Bennett received support from unions and environmental groups and gave a 
personal loan of about $3,700 to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Monahan reported spending $19,825 for his fifth reelection bid. 
Monahan, a welding contractor who has consistently supported development, 
received many contributions from local unions, developers and car dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle, who came in fourth, spent $12,168 on his campaign. 
Tuttle, who comes from an environmentalist and grass-roots background, received 
contributions from some unions and Patagonia, the apparel firm that helped 
catapult him into city politics in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, 12 of the 14 candidates who ran for council seats had submitted 
financial disclosure forms as required by state law. Many contributors were not 
identified because they gave less than $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Schmitz, a certified public accountant, and Dick Massa, who owns a 
medical-supply company, have not filed their disclosure forms. They finished 
sixth and 10th, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council candidates reported their expenditures as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 Clark Owens, a real estate broker, reported $21,865. Virginia Weber, an 
educational grants administrator, reported $17,206. Nancy Cloutier, who owns 
the Ventura County & Coast Reporter, reported $15,567. Todd Collart, a county 
planner, reported $10,506. Charles Kistner, a business owner, reported $7,114. 
Neil Demers-Grey, a secretary, reported $1,155. Carroll Dean Williams and Brian 
Lee Rencher reported receiving and spending less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Political action groups also reported spending at least $51,771 in the 
campaign to promote or attack candidates. Although no candidate actively 
engaged in negative campaigning, last year's council race was marked by 
mudslinging from some political action groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Venturans for Responsible Government, a group composed for ranchers, 
developers and other business interests, reported spending $12,598 in a 
campaign that harshly criticized Bennett, Tuttle and Collart, who lost his 
reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia, which helped engineer the 1989 victories of Tuttle, Collart and 
Cathy Bean, spent about $8,782 in advertisements promoting Tuttle, Bennett and 
Cloutier. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrift store magnate Ray Ellison, who ran a negative campaign against Tuttle, 
Bennett and Collart, reported spending nearly $15,000, according to a report 
filed last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Chamber of Commerce, which helped elect three pro-business 
candidates in 1991, spent $11,338 in support of Measures, Monahan, Schmitz and 
Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Barbara Kam said the remaining forms may arrive by mail and will be 
acceptable if they are postmarked by the deadline. After a 10-day grace period, 
any candidate who fails to disclose records of campaign finances is subject to 
a fine of $10 per day, Kam said.

CHANCES OF A WET YEAR EVAPORATING; WEATHER: THE PATTERN OF DRY WINDS AND LITTLE 
RAINFALL CONTINUES, RAISING FEARS OF ANOTHER LONG ARID SPELL. BUT RESERVOIRS 
ARE STILL IN GOOD SHAPE.

 As dry winds swept across Ventura County on Monday, hydrologists marked the 
end of another month with below-average rainfall, raising fears that the county 
and state may be entering another dry year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainfall totals countywide are only 36% of normal for this point in the rainy 
season, and no rain is on the horizon at least through Sunday, meteorologists 
say. The statewide snowpack, which helps determine how much water can be 
shipped to Southern California, measured only 45% of normal, the state 
hydrologist said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the National Weather Service's long-range forecast through April 
calls for a 51% chance that rainfall will be below normal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture is not all gloomy, officials said. Reservoirs throughout the 
county and state are still in good shape from the previous two years, when 
rainfall was 125% and 180% of normal, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground-water basins are still relatively full as well, said John Weikel, 
senior engineer in the county's Flood Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if this dry weather persists for any amount of time, we'll be back into 
water conservation measures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still hopeful of getting some significant rain in February and March," 
he said, noting that the rain year that began in October has three months to 
go. "Back in 1991, we had even less rainfall at this time of year and February 
and March brought us back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the rainfall picture is similar to that in Ventura County, said 
Maurice Roos, the state hydrologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Roos said the best months for snow are December, January and February, 
followed by November and March. And with two of the three most productive 
months already past, Roos said the outlook is for a drier-than-normal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was drier in 1991 than it is this year," he said. "It's not as bad as the 
worst, but it would sure be nice if it were better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reservoirs throughout the State Water Project's network are still in good 
shape with the carry-over from last year, Roos said. Overall, the reservoirs 
are at 95% of their normal levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ventura County is stuck in a pattern of no rainfall and dry winds. 
Although the winds that gusted up to 40 m.p.h. in Camarillo on Monday caused no 
notable damage in the county, they are a headache to farmers, said Rex Laird, 
executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The dry winds batter tree fruit and lower the price they bring on the market. 
And the lack of rain is forcing farmers to irrigate during a period when they 
can usually count on rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not raining, they're having to turn on their pumps, and that costs 
them money," Laird said. And irrigation is a poor substitute for a good, 
drenching rain, which washes the leaves and forces salts in the soil below the 
root zones of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Laird hasn't heard many complaints. "Farmers have so many adversities that 
they are just kind of used to this," he said. "It comes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
 And for the time being, at least, there is plenty of water to pump. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground-water basins are in excellent condition, said Frank Royer, assistant 
general manager of the United Water Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Piru is about half-full, after the district released its water down Piru 
Creek and into the Santa Clara River to help replenish ground-water basins. 
</P>
<P>
 That also makes room for runoff this year, Royer said. In the past two years, 
United has diverted 225,000 acre-feet of water from the river into underground 
basins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in as good a shape as we were at the beginning of the drought last time 
around," Royer said, referring to the six-year drought that ended in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The dry winter thus far has not affected Lake Casitas, the county's largest 
reservoir, said John Johnson, manager of the Casitas Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake is only down about 12,000 acre-feet from its capacity of 254,000 
acre-feet, which it reached during last year's storms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work on a 20-year cycle, so we're in good shape for a long time," Johnson 
said. "At the end of the 1986-1991 drought, we still had half a lake. So a dry 
spell that lasts for one year is relatively insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir levels in the State Water Project bode well for a good supply 
this year for Southern California users like the Calleguas Municipal Water 
District, said Donald Kendall, district general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which supplies Simi Valley, Moorpark, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo 
and Oxnard with all or some of their water, is now buying water to inject into 
the ground for storage, where it can be pumped out during dry months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is that the water gets you through the dry years without 
having to ration," Kendall said. "You take advantage of the water when it's 
available." Rainfall Comparison

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HIGH SCHOOL BAND INVITED TO WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years after American forces landed at Normandy, a Ventura County high 
school band is preparing to land on a different shore to celebrate the 
anniversary of the World War II invasion of Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hueneme High School concert band has been asked to perform in Washington, 
D.C., on June 22 for a 50th anniversary commemoration of the famous battle. 
</P>
<P>
 As the only high school band selected from California, the group will 
represent the state at the three-day Normandy Liberation and Bicentennial Music 
Celebration that is being sponsored by the French government. They would join 
about 35 bands from other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival organizers said they chose the Hueneme High band on the 
recommendation of a national association of symphonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Hueneme High band earns consistently superior ratings at music 
competitions, band director Michael Doty said. And the walls of the Hueneme 
High band room are lined with trophies and plaques earned in contests from 
Norwalk to Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most of the flutists, drummers and other student musicians in the 
group, Washington would be the farthest they have ever traveled from home, Doty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said they were surprised to learn they had been chosen for the trip, 
to include sightseeing tours in the nation's capital. "I was flabbergasted," 
said John Montes, a senior who plays clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they just have to raise the money to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Doty estimates it will cost $950 per person, or about $53,000, to send 50 
students and five chaperons. 
</P>
<P>
 That's roughly $50,000 more than is left from the band's last candy sale. But 
Doty said he is confident they will raise most of the money from local 
businesses and service organizations throughout the state. Parents will have to 
chip in the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides giving the students an opportunity to travel, Doty said the trip would 
benefit the children musically. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so limited here," Doty said. "They're used to audiences around here 
who appreciate them because they're their own sons and daughters." 
</P>
<P>
 At the celebration in Washington, the student musicians would be treated more 
like professionals, the band director said. "They'll have to play in a location 
they've never played in before and hear applause from people that have never 
seen them before," he said. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; NAVY TO CHARGE 3 IN CAPTURE OF 
DESERTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three members of the U.S. Navy's military police in Port Hueneme are facing 
charges of misconduct for apprehending a deserter off base without 
authorization, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men, in addition to a civilian employee of the military police at 
the Naval Construction Battalion Center, captured the deserter by stopping him 
while he was driving in Oxnard Nov. 16 , Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Nugent, resident agent in charge of the Naval Criminal Investigative 
Service in Port Hueneme, said the four were outside their jurisdiction when 
they made the stop and did not have the authority to do so. "Their jurisdiction 
is within the base," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deserter, whom military officials would not identify, was already facing 
military charges when he left the base, Nugent said.  
</P>
<P>
 Master-at-Arms Senior Chief George R. Taylor, Operations Specialist 2nd Class 
Mark A. Bassett and Signalman 2nd Class Thomas S. Hinson have all opted to have 
their case tried during a court martial, rather than settling the charges 
against them in an administrative hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If found guilty of a charge of dereliction of duty, the three could face up to 
six months in confinement and a bad conduct discharge, Nugent said. 
</P>
<P>
 A base spokeswoman said that a date for the court martial has not yet been 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron J. Frank, a civilian employee of the military police who was allegedly 
involved in the incident, will probably face disciplinary procedures, Nugent 
said. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: 5TH SUSPECT HELD IN SLAYING AT MOTEL 
</P>

<P>
 Police have arrested a fifth suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of 
a Whittier man at a Ventura motel in December, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Serrato Cortez, 21, was taken into custody Thursday and booked into 
County Jail on suspicion of acting as an accessory to the Dec. 18 murder of 
21-year-old Paul Martinez at the Motel 6 on Johnson Drive, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez, of Port Hueneme, was released on $5,000 bail and is expected to be 
charged by the district attorney's office on Thursday, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Matthew J. Hardy, who is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other suspects were charged with murder last Thursday, and a woman was 
charged with being an accessory to the crime for trying to help cover up the 
slaying, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three murder suspects are being held in jail in lieu of $1 million bail, 
and the woman is being held on $250,000 bail, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez went to Motel 6 the night of the shooting with a friend from Los 
Angeles and a group of people from Santa Paula, police said. The shooting 
occurred after an encounter with a group of people from Oxnard and Port Hueneme 
that included gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have said that at least two gunmen opened fire from inside their 
cars in the motel's parking lot. Martinez was shot and killed as he stood on 
the second-story walkway. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; STUBBORN RIVERBED BRUSH FIRE SMOLDERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A stubborn brush fire along the edge of the Santa Clara riverbed was still 
sending up plumes of smoke Monday as investigators continued to search for the 
cause, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires began about 7:30 p.m. Saturday in three separate spots, then joined 
together, covering eight to 10 acres, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters had a tough time reaching the flames because they had to carry 
water hoses through several hundred yards of thick bamboo. The blaze was south 
of the Buenaventura Golf Course, near radio station KBBY-FM on Olivas Park 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fire was brought under control by late Saturday, it continued to 
smolder through the weekend. Two county fire companies along with a bulldozer 
and a water tanker were dispatched again about 10 a.m. Monday to douse a couple 
of hot spots, said Sandi Wells, a spokeswoman for the county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said investigators have found several campsites they believe may be 
related to the fire, but they have not ruled the blaze to be arson. JULIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PARK-AND-RIDE LOT FOR CAR-POOLS TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans officials on Monday announced they will open a new park-and-ride lot 
in Camarillo on Thursday to offer another location for car-pools and help 
relieve traffic congestion into Los Angeles following the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a vital necessity now," said Patricia Reid, a Caltrans spokeswoman.The 
new lot, which is located just south of the Ventura Freeway on Pleasant Valley 
Road, is designed to be a staging area for car-pools and van-pools. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the 18th park-and-ride facility in Ventura County, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lot has 140 parking spaces and special area for locking bicycles. The 
park-and-ride lot will be lighted and open 24 hours a day, but has yet to 
receive bus service, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those who car-pool or van-pool, this will make it easier," Tricia Price, 
regional manager of Commuter Transportation Services, a division of Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said she anticipates an increased number of Ventura County residents 
will car-pool to work because of increased traffic on the Ventura Freeway 
following the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo has one other park-and-ride at Las Posas Road and the Ventura 
Freeway, which Camarillo City Manager Bill Little said has been helpful and 
well-used. 
</P>
<P>
 Little said the city realized a new facility was necessary after receiving 
numerous complaints from residents in the Pleasant Valley area saying commuters 
were parking on their residential streets in the morning to catch car-pools or 
van-pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new park-and-ride lot cost $197,400 to construct and was jointly built by 
Caltrans and the city of Camarillo. The city paid for the design and Caltrans 
paid for construction, she said. Caltrans will operate the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The park-and-ride lot's grand opening will be at 10 a.m. Thursday. TRACY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CRAVEN WILL SEEK 3RD COUNCIL TERM

<P>
 Camarillo City Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said Monday that she intends to 
seek a third term on the City Council in November's general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven is the first of three incumbent council members whose terms expire in 
November to announce a bid for reelection.If elected, Craven, a former mayor of 
the city, will start her third term in office. After an unsuccessful bid in 
1982, she was elected to the council in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I want to run again because there are issues coming before the 
council that I would like to have a hand in resolving," Craven said. "I feel 
like there's still important work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49-year-old councilwoman said that, if reelected, she will concentrate on 
maintaining the city's conservative fiscal policies, continuing to support the 
creation of affordable family housing in the city and working to see that a 
Point Mugu Navy base proposal to open its runway to civilian and cargo traffic 
does not adversely affect Camarillo residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Also up for reelection in the fall are Mayor Ken Gose and Councilman Stan 
Daily. Gose said Monday that he has not made up his mind whether he will run. 
Daily could not be reached for comment Monday. The candidates' filing period 
opens July 18. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY LEADERS APPROVE ANNEXING 87 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Ventura City Council on Monday gave final approval to annexing 87 acres of 
city-owned lemon and avocado orchards at the northeast corner of Telegraph Road 
and Petit Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they are annexing the parcel so they can avoid paying 
$20,000 annually in property taxes to the county.The land is zoned agricultural 
and under the city's Comprehensive Plan, is scheduled to stay agricultural 
until the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura-based developer Ron Hertel has proposed that he swap agricultural 
land that he owns with the city's land, and put up single-family houses on city 
land. In exchange, Hertel would give Ventura $2 million to build a park on 92 
acres of celery fields that he owns at Telephone and Kimball roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members have expressed interest in Hertel's idea, but no deal has 
been finalized yet. Last week a council subcommittee recommended that the city 
consider rezoning the 87 acres from agricultural to permit residential 
construction. The council is scheduled to vote on the zone change Feb. 14.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEW EDUCATION TEST DATA DUE BY FEB. 18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the state prepares to release the first results of a new test, Ventura 
County education officials on Monday said the figures will give teachers a 
better idea of how well students are learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Results from the California Learning Assessment System, known as CLAS, will be 
released by Feb. 18, said Diana Rigby, director of curriculum and instruction 
for the Ventura County superintendent of schools' office. 
</P>
<P>
 The new test, initially administered statewide last spring, is meant to 
measure how well students perform by having them write essays or solve 
mathematics problems and show how they arrive at their answers. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS replaces the California Assessment Program, which used multiple-choice 
questions to measure students' abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supt. Charles Weis likened such a multiple-choice test to 
measuring students' ability to play basketball by quizzing them on the rules. 
The CLAS testing program offers a much better approach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we're giving you a ball, putting you out on the court and letting 
you shoot," Weis said. "It's a real era change for assessment." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the test is expensive to develop and score. More than 1,500 teachers 
gathered at 25 sites across the state to grade the tests. Because of the 
complexity, results have been delayed from the original release date in 
October, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a price tag of $27 million, the new test is three times most costly to 
administer and score than the CAP test, officials said. Last year, students in 
fourth, eighth and 10th grades were tested in writing, reading and math.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CITY TO VOTE ON JOINING WASTE DISPOSAL 
EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Simi Valley and Moorpark officials are anxiously awaiting the expected opening 
later this month of a hazardous material recycling center -- two years in the 
making -- that will allow residents to legally dispose of used oil, paints, car 
batteries and antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been heading in this direction for quite some time," Moorpark Mayor 
Paul Lawrason said Monday. "You need a place to dispose of those things. 
Obviously, we have nothing like that in our city at the present time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council on Wednesday will vote on whether to officially join 
Simi Valley in helping pay for construction and operation of the center at 
670-A W. Los Angeles Ave. in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the action to be considered by the council, Moorpark would pay $15,500 
as its portion of the $70,000 cost of building the center, and would agree to 
pay between $27.50 and $51 for each trip to the center by a Moorpark resident, 
based upon the amount of waste dropped off. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the action at its meeting beginning at 7 p.m. in 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility, which is already built, is scheduled to open on Saturdays from 
noon to 4 p.m., weather permitting, on an appointment-only basis. Officials 
hoped it have it open by Feb. 12, but said difficulties related to last month's 
earthquake could delay that by a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the recycling center opens, residents will be allowed to drop off up to 
10 gallons of paint or antifreeze, two automotive batteries and up to 20 
gallons of used motor oil per trip. Simi Valley Councilman Bill Davis said it 
makes sense for the two east county cities to join forces in establishing the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way you pool resources," Davis said. "It costs both cities less money to 
build and serves that many more people. You're picking up many, many more 
people and saving taxpayer dollars." JAMES MAIELLA JR.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; LAW WOULD REGULATE BUILDING REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council on Wednesday will consider adopting an urgency 
ordinance that would regulate the reconstruction of buildings damaged in last 
month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere in our codes does it say, or is it clear, how to treat a partially 
destroyed building in terms of restoring it," said Mayor Paul Lawrason."This is 
just putting in place some guidelines and requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, if 10% or less of a structure is damaged, the owner need 
only bring the building into compliance with the building codes that were in 
place when it was built. If between 10% and 50% of the building is damaged, 
then the portion being repaired must be brought into compliance with the most 
current building codes. If more than 50% of the structure is damaged, the 
entire structure must be brought within current codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another portion of the law sets a tough new standard for block or "garden" 
walls constructed in the city, requiring all such walls to be designed by a 
professional engineer or architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said he has problems with that section of the law because of the cost 
it would impose on residents and businesses. "I understand the reason for it, 
but there must be some alternative to that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss the proposal at its 7 p.m. meeting in City Hall.

FILLMORE CITY COUNCIL REFUSES TO HALT THE DEMOLITION OF HOTEL; HOUSING: OWNER 
OF LOW-INCOME RESIDENCE VOWS TO TRY TO OVERTURN CONDEMNATION ORDER AS HE DID 
AFTER 1987 EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Fillmore City Council on Monday refused to halt the planned demolition of 
the Fillmore Hotel, which provided lodging for farm workers and their families 
before being damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Hotel owner Eric Marsh was the only building owner to appeal the 
city's plans to raze 14 condemned structures that suffered structural damage 
during the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm contesting this based on the fact that this building is repairable," 
Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his objection, the City Council unanimously approved the 
recommendation from Fillmore's Building and Safety Department to tear down the 
two-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are looking for an excuse to close me down, fine," Marsh told the 
council. But, he warned, "You are mistaken if you think this will stop here." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh said in an interview that he believes he can prevail, as he did several 
years ago when he successfully overturned a city condemnation order after the 
residential hotel was damaged in the 1987 Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that 80 people who lived in the hotel were made 
homeless last month when the outer walls on the second floor of the building 
collapsed in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh was concerned that if he demolished the hotel and rebuilt, the city 
would reduce the number of rooms allowed on the site. Marsh said this would 
undermine his ability to provide low-priced rentals for the city's numerous 
low-income renters.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore hotel is divided into 17 units that housed about 80 people. Under 
the new city code, any new building on the site would only be allowed to 
contain three residential units. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why the city would want to undermine this (repair) plan," Marsh 
said. "The hotel is one of the only successful businesses in town. We can 
afford to repair the building, so why not let us?"  
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Stuart, director of Fillmore's building inspection team since the 
earthquake, told the council that the building suffered significant structural 
damage and could not be repaired safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart detailed the damage to the building in a report submitted to the 
council Monday night. He said all four walls suffered damage, including severe 
cracks to the north and south walls, which could fall at any time. He said the 
structure is considered so unstable that the urban search and rescue team 
refused to enter the building to retrieve tenants' belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they were amazed that no one was killed or seriously 
injured when the walls on the hotel's second floor fell away from the building 
during the quake, smashing into the sidewalk and crushing cars parked along the 
street.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just looking at it scares me," said Mayor Linda Brewster. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh argued that the structure held up reasonably well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building did just what it was supposed to do. The walls fell out and the 
building did not collapse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the city condemned his building in 1987, Marsh sued the city. He argued 
that city officials had always wanted to get rid of the hotel because it housed 
many poor Latino migrant workers. To settle Marsh's lawsuit in 1988, the city 
overturned its condemnation order and Marsh agreed to spend close to $100,000 
for safety improvements.  
</P>
<P>
 Marsh is threatening to sue the city again. He said his engineer detailed a 
plan to repair the damaged structure.  
</P>
<P>
 "If this is how they want it -- fine," he said. "We came out fine on the last 
lawsuit. I made money on that one, if fact. Look, this goes to my most basic 
property rights. It took me 20 years to be able to buy that property and I've 
invested more than seven years into it since then. I'm not going to give it 
up."

SIMI MAYOR DECLARES CANDIDACY FOR COUNTY AUDITOR-CONTROLLER; POLITICS: PLEDGING 
TOUGH FISCAL MANAGEMENT, GREG STRATTON LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN AGAINST INCUMBENT 
THOMAS O. MAHON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that "business as usual is not good enough" when it comes to 
safeguarding taxpayer money, Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton on Monday formally 
declared his candidacy for Ventura County auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thrust of my campaign will be changing the role of the county 
auditor-controller to a more visible and responsive part of county management," 
Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton, 47, is running for the $115,000-a-year post against appointed 
incumbent Thomas O. Mahon. Ventura accountant Scott A. Weiss is also 
considering a bid for the controller's job, which is responsible for overseeing 
the county's $836-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Stratton pledged to bring to his new position the same tough 
fiscal management style he has become known for as mayor of Simi Valley. He 
noted that during his 14 years on the City Council -- the last seven as mayor 
-- the city's reserves have grown from $2 million to nearly $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city of Simi Valley is in excellent financial shape," Stratton 
told reporters at a news conference at City Hall. "Unfortunately," he said, 
"that's not true" of the county or the state. 
</P>
<P>
 As auditor-controller, Stratton said he would crack down on bureaucratic 
agencies that waste millions of tax dollars through inefficiency. One such 
agency, he said, is the county's Information Services Department, which spends 
$12 million a year on computer services. 
</P>
<P>
 "With my expertise in computers and software, I can go to the county and help 
save millions of dollars just in that one area alone," said Stratton, director 
of the software department at Teledyne Systems in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahon said that Stratton was speaking without knowing all the facts. Mahon 
said he did not know offhand how much the county spends on computer services, 
but insisted that such flagrant waste of taxpayer money is not occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," Mahon said in reference to Stratton's statements. "As an 
auditor-controller, you don't go around making statements you can't prove." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said that if elected, he would call for more audits of county 
departments. He said he would also make sure the $26 million generated each 
year from Proposition 172's half-cent sales tax is used for law enforcement and 
fire protection, as intended by the voters who approved the ballot measure last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Stratton proposed that a portion of the sales-tax money be used 
to pay Simi Valley's share of the nearly $1 million in jail booking fees owed 
to the county. Ventura County and its cities have been waging a legal battle 
over the fees charged when suspects are arrested in a city and booked at the 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Stratton said the sales-tax dollars should be used to restore cuts 
made in the county Sheriff's Department and in the district attorney's office. 
"The incumbent was prepared to see all of the new Proposition 172 money 
disappear into the bureaucracy and not give a dime for improved public safety," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahon said it is up to the County Board of Supervisors to decide how to 
spend Proposition 172 money, not the auditor-controller. He said the only 
decision made so far regarding this money was to give $1.5 million to the 
Sheriff's Department for increased patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really criticizing the Board of Supervisors," Mahon said. "We only 
provide information to the board. The decisions of what to do with the money is 
the prerogative of the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he would like to conduct more audits of county departments, but he 
doesn't have the staffing because of cutbacks. He said audits now conducted by 
his office save the county on average about $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing an outstanding job," said Mahon, who was appointed by the Board 
of Supervisors last January to complete Norman R. Hawkes' term after Hawkes 
retired. Mahon previously served as assistant auditor for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton pledged to spend as much as $100,000 on the campaign if necessary, a 
figure that Mahon has vowed to match. Among those who have endorsed Stratton 
are Simi Valley City Council members Bill Davis, Judy Mikels, Sandi Webb and 
Barbara Williamson, who is a candidate for county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other supporters include Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason, Thousand Oaks City 
Councilman and supervisorial candidate Frank Schillo and Santa Paula Mayor 
Wayne Johnson.

REAGAN LIBRARY NAMES NEW DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Norton Smith, a historian and biographer who late last year became 
executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and the Center 
for Public Affairs, will also become director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential 
Library in Simi Valley on Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has served as director of the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library 
and Dwight D. Eisenhower Center, succeeds Ralph C. Bledsoe, who has headed the 
Reagan library since it opened in November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe, will return to Washington, D.C., to take a "high level" position with 
the National Archives and Records Administration, Smith said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the exciting things about, in effect, combining all of these 
positions is the opportunity to approach everything we do in a unified 
fashion," Smith said Monday. "Whether it's creating a temporary exhibit in the 
museum or a scholarly conference in the Center for Public Affairs or a 
promotional strategy designed to increase our visibility and visitation -- all 
of this planning will come from one office." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan welcomed Smith in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy and I are delighted to have Richard Norton Smith build upon the 
remarkable work he has already set in motion during these past few months," 
Reagan said in the statement. "We could not have found a better candidate to 
head the library. His ability is equaled only by his enthusiasm."

SECRETARY SABOTAGED ACCUSED PRIEST'S CAR TO PREVENT ESCAPE; TRIAL: CHURCH AIDE 
TESTIFIES THAT SHE AND MAID FOUND LARGE SUMS HIDDEN IN FATHER DAVID PIROLI'S 
QUARTERS. PIROLI IS CHARGED WITH GRAND THEFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Simi Valley church secretary testified Monday that after finding bundles of 
cash in Father David Dean Piroli's rooms, she let the air out of his car tire 
for fear that he would flee with parishioners' collection money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he'd be getting away with the money, and there went our proof, and 
there went all our parishioners' cash," Eileen Slavin testified at Piroli's 
embezzlement trial in Ventura County Superior Court. Piroli, 37, faces two 
counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavin testified that her sabotage of Piroli's church car on June 3, 1992, 
occurred the day after she and church maid Dorothy Meyer searched his rooms at 
the St. Peter Claver Church residence. The search was initiated a few days 
after Piroli was arrested in a church car in Hollywood, surrounded by $10,000 
in cash, collection envelopes and traces of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's pastor, Father James McKeon, had suggested that the search begin 
in Piroli's dresser drawer because McKeon had once noticed cash there, Slavin 
testified. After she told Meyer to start there, the tearful maid summoned her 
to Piroli's bedroom and pointed to the priest's dresser drawer, Slavin 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There, Slavin testified, "I saw the money spread across the drawer underneath 
underwear and socks. . . . I felt it was about three inches deep." 
</P>
<P>
 The women and other church employees poked through filing cabinets in Piroli's 
bedroom and office, finding cash stuffed into boxes, bags, drawers and closet 
shelves, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 There were messy piles of money in a cardboard box, neatly sorted stacks of 
cash arrayed in drawers, and folded wads of $50 and $100 bills stuffed into a 
coffee can in a red filing cabinet by Piroli's bed, Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not disturb the cash, fearing Piroli might discover them in his 
rooms, Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next day, she said, after Piroli drove to Los Angeles to explain his 
arrest to archdiocesan officials, Slavin looked in the underwear drawer again. 
The cash was gone, she testified, and she could no longer open the filing 
cabinet beside Piroli's bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some time after Piroli returned, she sneaked into the garage and let some of 
the air out of the left rear tire of the church-owned Chevrolet Lumina to 
prevent him from fleeing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Piroli somehow left again, Slavin testified, she and Meyer searched his 
rooms again and found that cash was still hidden in other areas. They moved all 
the cash they found into a locked closet in the rectory, or church office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer wrestled the filing cabinet from beside Piroli's bed into the hall, and 
the two women carried it to the closet and locked it in, Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, church employees loaded all the money into Deacon Richard Hamm's 
car, including money that Meyer pulled out of the locked filing cabinet after 
jimmying it open with a screwdriver, Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 They drove it to Slavin's house, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a quarter to 6 we started counting, and we counted money until 10 after 2 
in the morning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The total: $47,666, plus $2,360 in checks, a jar full of change and dozens of 
special collection envelopes from St. Peter Claver, many of them already 
emptied, Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 On cross-examination, defense attorney Richard Beada pointed out that Slavin's 
testimony about her reason for the search failed to match an earlier statement 
to an investigator. To the investigator, she never said that McKeon had 
mentioned finding money in Piroli's drawer.

 * I am curious to know why your reporters consistently refer to the Employment 
Development Department as "the unemployment office."I find no rationale for it 
except that among the functions of the office is processing applications for 
unemployment insurance benefits. The primary purpose is, as its official name 
notes, development of employment opportunities. A person does not have to be 
unemployed to be served there. 
</P>
<P>
 Television reporters use the same designation. This conveys a negative image 
to the public and anyone who wants to use the services of that department.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: EVER SO SLOWLY, A NEW LOAN PROGRAM TAKES SHAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If an award were given for persistence, it would definitely go to Rep. John 
LaFalce (D.-N.Y.), chairman of the House Small Business Committee. For the past 
10 years, LaFalce has struggled to create a government-sponsored secondary 
market for small-business loans as a way to boost the flow of capital to 
entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Venture Enhancement and Loan Development Administration for Smaller 
Undercapitalized Enterprise, or Velda Sue as it is commonly known, has 
languished for more than a decade. LaFalce, an outspoken small-business 
advocate from Upstate New York, insists that "Velda Sue is alive and well." 
Still, many congressional insiders are convinced she is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 LaFalce admits that this is not the best time to be creating a new government 
entity. Although the White House supports the concept of a secondary market for 
small-business loans, Vice President Al Gore Jr. is aggressively streamlining 
the bureaucracy, trying to eliminate government agencies, not create them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President has said we need to facilitate development of a secondary 
market for small-business loans," LaFalce said. "Now it seems the easiest thing 
is to go about it piecemeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents believe that up to $50 billion worth of small-business loans could 
ultimately be packaged and sold to investors. A new secondary market would not 
only free up more capital as banks pooled and sold off their loans, but it 
would provide investors with attractive new opportunities aimed at fueling 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite widespread support, at least six bills dealing with creation of a 
secondary market for small-business loans are stalled in various committees. 
The most promising one, introduced by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R.-N.Y.), was 
approved by the Senate Banking Committee, and a similar measure drafted by Rep. 
Paul Kanjorski (D-Penn.) was introduced in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds are as high as 90% for passing a securitization bill in 1994," 
predicted Bob Zimmer, a Republican staff member on the House Banking Committee. 
Zimmer is one of many congressional staffers who believe the private sector can 
create a secondary market for small-business loans without much government 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many experts believe the securitization can be done without the government 
assuming any of the risk," Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pooling and selling loans is not a novel concept. Currently about 50% of the 
nation's $1.5 trillion in residential mortgages has been packaged into 
securities through government-sponsored Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Student loans totaling $27 billion, $64.5 billion worth of credit card 
receivables and $59.8 billion worth of auto loans have also been pooled and 
sold as securities, according to an Oct. 13 report issued by the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The private sector, tired of waiting for Congress to act, is slowly moving 
toward creating the secondary market. Two years ago, Chrysler Corp.'s finance 
subsidiary issued $350 million in securities backed by a pool of small-business 
loans secured by real estate. Last March, Money Store issued $76 million in 
securities backed by the unguaranteed portion of some Small Business 
Administration loans. And in April, Santa Monica-based Fremont General Corp. 
sold $200 million worth of securities backed by a pool of small- and 
medium-sized-business loans. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also smaller players on the market. Target Income Fund, managed by 
Tustin-based Finance 500 Inc., has packaged and sold about $8.1 million worth 
of short-term small-business credit lines and loans, according to President 
Lance Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund, which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, has 
a diversified portfolio containing about 40 short-term loans and credit lines 
issued to small businesses. Hicks said many of the businesses are thriving but, 
for one reason or another, had trouble obtaining traditional bank financing. 
Current borrowers range from makers of plastic, clothing, computer software and 
hospital equipment to several small employment agencies and freight companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fund is essentially run like a bank," explained Hicks. Business owners 
submit applications for funds to be used for a revolving credit line or 
short-term loan. The loans, which generally carry an interest rate of 4% to 5% 
over the prime rate, are collateralized by accounts receivable and corporate 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ongoing challenge is to match the money we have available with the best 
companies," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Target Income Fund relies on Reid Rutherford, chairman and chief executive of 
Palo Alto-based Exxe Data Corp., and his marketing representatives to screen 
and process loan applications. The 9-year-old company also designs software and 
systems to help banks and other financial institutions pool and sell 
small-business loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last market left for the banking industry is the small-business market," 
Rutherford said. The problem? "Banks do have money to lend now, but the reality 
is that they don't want to put it out in small amounts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford says he's optimistic that the secondary market for small-business 
loans is about to take off and that his 35-employee firm is prepared to provide 
the tools to help financial institutions make it happen. (For information on 
applying for a Target Income Fund loan or credit line, write to Exxe Data 
Corp., 1170 E. Meadow Drive, Palo Alto, CA 94303-4234.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rep. LaFalce says he's not convinced that funds such as Target 
Income and even bigger private investors can solve the continuing 
small-business credit crunch alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "These (securitized loans) are dribbles in comparison to what we need," he 
said. LaFalce also says that even after a decade of trying, he's not ready to 
give up on Velda Sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of life in the old gal," LaFalce said. "Rumors of her demise 
have been greatly exaggerated."

 Television: With Turner Broadcasting System's acquisition Friday of film 
distributor New Line Cinema, speculation is growing that cable mogul Ted 
Turner's next target may be RHI Entertainment. Led by longtime producer Robert 
Halmi Sr., RHI is one of the top suppliers of programs to the major television 
networks, including "Lonesome Dove" starring Robert Duvall and the upcoming 
"Scarlett," a miniseries sequel to "Gone With the Wind."Traders, some of whom 
are betting Turner will acquire the rest of RHI, have been quickly bidding up 
its stock. But a spokesman for RHI denies that any such plan is in the works, 
saying the company believes the stock's climb can be attributed to RHI's 
healthy earnings outlook and record backlog. RHI's stock rose 87.5 cents Monday 
to $30.125 on the American Stock Exchange. JAMES BATES

doing. Solters said he is still working for Jackson and will remain involved in 
various matters for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Jackson's attorneys announced that he has settled for an 
undisclosed amount a civil lawsuit brought by a teen-age boy who accused 
Jackson of sexually molesting him. Jackson has denied the allegations.

THE WEEK AHEAD: MUNICH; DEFENSIVE THINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the former 
Warsaw Pact nations will gather in Germany this weekend for a privately 
organized defense studies symposium. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Wehrkundetagung, the annual session traditionally attracts some of 
the finest military thinkers and strategists, including defense ministers, for 
private discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no set agenda, observers say the main topics will include 
NATO's military reaction in Bosnia, the effect of defense budget reductions and 
the outlook for President Clinton's new "Partnership for Peace," bringing 
Eastern European nations into a closer relationship with NATO.

DOCUMENTARY; CHINESE DO FIGURE-EIGHTS AROUND HARDSHIPS; WINTER IN BEIJING CAN 
BE A SOOTY, FRIGID MESS. BUT A LITTLE MOONLIGHT SKATING ON THE MOAT CAN WORK 
WONDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are few things in life grimmer than winter in the Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Coal dust and soot from furnaces and stoves turn every surface a dull, 
brooding gray. Piercing, frigid winds howl down from Siberia. Chest colds, 
Beijing flu and bronchitis infect everyone, so bus and subway passengers form a 
chorus of hacking, wheezing sufferers. Frozen spittle coats the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Beijingers, Chinese and foreigners alike, can look forward to the end of 
December, when the lakes and ponds of the city and environs freeze over. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the time, between Christmas and the Chinese Spring Festival (Feb. 
10-12), for moonlight skating on the moat around the Forbidden City; for ice 
dancing and hockey matches on the frozen lakes of Beihai and Purple Bamboo 
parks, and for weekend frolics on the wide, wind-swept, frozen waters of the 
old and new Qing Dynasty summer palaces 10 miles northwest of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the booming "what next?" Chinese economy, it is probably only a matter of 
time before a flamboyant Hong Kong investor or the profit-seeking arm of the 
People's Liberation Army opens up a giant shopping mall with an atrium 
ice-skating rink. As it is, Beijing now has only one year-round indoor rink, at 
the Capital Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter skating in Beijing is glorious not because one is on ice, but because 
of where that ice is. Few other places on earth offer such dramatic settings, 
redolent of history, for ice adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 For an admission charge of only two yuan, about 25 cents, for example, skaters 
at Beihai Park are entitled to two hours on the ice -- periodically swept and 
smoothed by broom-bearing maintenance crews -- at the foot of the White Pagoda 
Temple and Ming Dynasty Round City. 
</P>
<P>
 For the equivalent of 30 cents, visitors can rent skates or the chairs on 
runners known as bing che.  
</P>
<P>
 Getting outdoor exercise in Beijing is not always easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Street traffic is predatory, so jogging is not advised. Thousands of yellow 
taxi vans -- called "bread loaves" by Beijingers -- roam the streets in 
high-speed pursuit of pedestrians. Also, joggers must vie with bicycles and an 
increasing number of motorized tricycles for space on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But our family of four -- including an 8-year-old girl and 5-year-old boy with 
seemingly limitless energy -- quickly discovered that taking to the ice in 
Beijing was a way to get our exercise, encounter China and avoid the careening 
yellow bread loaves. As of this writing, no traffic fatalities have been 
reported on the ice of Beijing parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was a bit daunting for the middle-aged parents, whose closest 
previous contact with solid water not in a glass was a 1979 ice storm in Texas, 
to wobble out on the ice for the first time.  
</P>
<P>
 My wife, who believes that department store elevators move at dangerously high 
speeds, found security on the ice by holding on to the back of one of the bing 
che chairs and pushing it around while shouting, "Watch out! Watch out!" 
</P>
<P>
 I personally discovered that ice skating is actually aided by the middle-age 
-- uhmm -- "settling" of body mass. The center of gravity, lowered -- in my 
case to a few inches above the ice surface -- helps maintain balance and makes 
falling something less than life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 That part mastered, the neophyte foreign skater in Beijing is left with 
perhaps the most difficult challenge: ice skating while attempting to speak 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that it was former University of Texas football coach Darrell Royal, 
or someone like him, who defined the most basic test of physical competence as 
the ability to walk and chew gum at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The next skill level is skating and speaking a foreign language at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Level three is skating and attempting to speak Chinese, a language nearly 
impossible to speak even when standing still. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with any experience here knows that Chinese people in parks are 
gregarious and inquisitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Skating in Beijing is an outdoor exercise experience punctuated by 
interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which country people are you?" is the most common demand, usually asked by 
someone skating maddeningly fast -- backward. 
</P>
<P>
 However, on a recent evening outing under the lights at Beihai Park, I was 
startled by a questioner who demanded: "What age?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was only later that I realized the woman who posed the question was 
inquiring about one of my children, skating beside me at the time. But at the 
time, startled and vulnerable on the ice, feeling very much my age and more, 
all I could do was blurt: "47 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Thank God I was not chewing gum at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to our incompetence on ice, many of the regular Chinese skaters 
are poetry in motion.  
</P>
<P>
 Zhang Meisheng, a retired building inspector, ice skates every day he can on 
Beihai Lake in the center of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Around him on the ice, helmeted members of the Beijing City Young People's 
Speed Skating Assn. blur past at astonishing velocities while their coach -- a 
"home-style" restaurant owner named Zhang Peng -- barks commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples tango and waltz near loudspeakers pouring out music. Uniformed 
soldiers of the People's Liberation Army flail and helicopter their arms in a 
futile effort to avoid crashing. Lovers take turns pushing each other on the 
bing che chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zhang Meisheng, 67, is a study in grace at his spot near the island in the 
middle of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, elegantly, he raises one leg in an arabesque, turns, reverses 
direction, his head and arms extended downward, almost touching the ice. 
Serenely, meditatively, he completes a few slow-motion spins. In the Chinese 
traditional marriage of sport and spirit, ice skating is the source of his qi 
-- his spiritual power, his force. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice skating, he said, is the way he keeps his health and his sanity: "Beijing 
is a place where it's easy to get a cold. I've had maybe one cold in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked the best time to skate in Beijing, Zhang smiled toothlessly and 
began to recite the "Nine Nine" rhyme. Familiar to every schoolchild on the 
North China Plain, the rhyme recounts the "Nine Nine Phases" of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter is divided into nine nine-day phases, set by the Chinese lunar 
calendar.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One nine, two nine: hands can't show;  
</P>
<P>
 Three nine, four nine: on the ice go.  
</P>
<P>
 Five nine, six nine: river willows seen.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven nine -- ice crack .  
</P>
<P>
 Eight nine -- swallows back,  
</P>
<P>
 Nine nine and one nine more, oxen in the fields encore .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like many poetic aspects of the Chinese language, the rhyme conforms to a 
seasonal rhythm, invariably tied to the cycle of planting and harvesting. The 
third and fourth phases of winter are considered the best time of all for 
skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my classmates don't like it when winter comes," said Nie Minhui, 23, 
a pretty, rosy-cheeked English teacher who recently graduated from the Beijing 
Foreign Language Normal College. "They all like summer. But I prefer winter, 
because of the skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago I met my boyfriend here," she said, pointing proudly to a 
tall, handsome young man leaning rakishly against a nearby guard rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Do they have plans to marry? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not yet," said Nie coyly, punctuating her statement with a crisp pirouette. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want, she doesn't," interjected the boyfriend, Wu Kai, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 After skating in the park surrounded by Chinese culture, a popular 
apres-skating repair is Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 The American company has a franchise, complete with life-size statues of the 
Colonel -- one with a yellow complexion, the other pink -- on White Pagoda 
Island in the center of Beihai Lake.

THE WEEK AHEAD: JOHANNESBURG; A NEW POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Africa's ruling National Party, which created apartheid in 1948 and 
began dismantling it in 1990, will hold its political convention Wednesday and 
Thursday to announce its parliamentary candidates and present its platform for 
the country's first multiracial democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In a keynote address, President Frederik W. de Klerk is expected to argue that 
the old right-wing party of white power and privilege has been transformed into 
a progressive, multiracial party uniquely qualified to govern a new South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The faithful will discuss the restructuring of the party, including a new 
constitution. Nevertheless, polls show the National Party is likely to run a 
distant second to Nelson Mandela's African National Congress when voters cast 
their ballots April 27-29.

NEXT STEP; MAKING ANOTHER DESERT BLOOM; EGYPT'S BIG PLANS FOR THE SINAI FEATURE 
A $1.4-BILLION NILE CANAL, MILLIONS OF SETTLERS AND A STRING OF COASTAL 
RESORTS.

 The peaked sands that fed and bewitched the children of Israel over 40 years 
of biblical history roll out to the end of the sky, and in their midst, 
clinging to a tenuous life, have sprung these few acres of new-sprouted olives, 
vegetables and tiny brick houses, battered by a chilly desert wind. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is called Takadom, which means "progress," and it is one of 
Egypt's tentative assertions of national possession over the vast northern 
Sinai, an empty desert roamed by invaders since the dawn of history and lost to 
Israel for 15 years, booty of the last two Arab-Israeli wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, a few dozen Egyptian families have settled in the one-room houses, 
fenced sandy lots and five acres of planted fields that the Cairo government is 
offering all university graduates mortgage-free for five years. Then, each 
family will have 30 years to pay off the $3,283 they owe for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 For Egypt, it is a way of easing the burden of population in the teeming Nile 
Valley -- where 96% of the country's 60 million people live on the fertile 
land, just 4% of Egypt's territory, that straddles the river. And politically, 
development of the Sinai asserts, once and for all, Egypt's hold on the 
strategic peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ali Abdel Qadir Ismail, 32, an agriculture graduate from the Suez Canal 
city of Ismailia who last year moved to Takadom, in the northern Sinai 
southwest of Al Arish, it is a way of staking a claim in a future -- for 
himself and for Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked for a rabbit breeding company in the private sector, making good 
money. But this is the future of my family," he said. "It is enough now that I 
live in a kingdom of my own, on land that has been irrigated with the blood of 
martyrs." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years after Israel returned the 23,622-square-mile Sinai to Egypt with 
the historic Camp David peace accords, Egypt is taking the most ambitious steps 
in its history to finally populate the vast, mountainous desert that is the 
most important land buffer between Arabs and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, digging began on the second phase of the Salaam (Peace) Canal, a 
$1.4-billion project to carry 12.5 million cubic meters a day of fresh water 
from the Nile into the northern Sinai, irrigating 400,000 acres of new farmland 
and opening the way for 3 million or more Egyptians to eventually populate a 
region that is now, despite 12 years of sporadic development, home to only 
about 250,000 Egyptians. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second-largest public works project in Egypt's history -- second 
only to the Aswan High Dam on the Nile -- and a crucial part of Egypt's plans 
not only to call the Sinai its own but to capitalize on $2.5 billion in 
investment envisioned as taking place in the neighboring Gaza Strip and West 
Bank when a peace agreement is signed between Palestinians and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Sinai development will guarantee Egypt's place in the emerging 
Middle East market and open a trade and travel corridor -- possible only with a 
final peace between Arabs and Israel -- that will link Libya on Egypt's western 
border, through the Sinai, to Israel, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and finally Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to make our plans, taking into consideration the changes that 
are happening in the area and internationally," said Hussein Gebaly of Egypt's 
Ministry of Reconstruction. "To the west we have the (North American Free 
Trade) Agreement, to the east we have the new tigers of Asia, and we have in 
our area the new Middle East market with its dimensions that are imposing 
change on us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sinai development plan, which has the highest priority in Egypt's 
five-year development projections, envisions new links between Egypt proper and 
the peninsula, either via a bridge across the Suez Canal or two new tunnels 
beneath it, an industrial zone straddling the canal at the city of Suez, 
expanded airports and power plants, mining development in the Sinai interior 
and a vast new network of housing, farmland and tourism along the pristine 
beaches of the Gulf of Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Egyptian officials are sure that it was in part the sheer emptiness of 
the Sinai -- invaded over the centuries by Jews, Romans, Muslims, Crusaders, 
Mamelukes, French and British forces -- that left the Red Sea peninsula easy 
prey for Israeli tanks when they advanced across its deserts in the 
Arab-Israeli war of 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 1982 that the last Israeli settlers, in a deal sweetened with 
cash settlements, packed their belongings and left. The Israeli army was 
replaced in front-line zones by an 11-nation military monitoring group, the 
U.S.-led Multinational Force and Observers, which has kept watch on a peace 
that only recently has seemed ready to deliver prosperity. The town of Taba, on 
the peninsula's eastern coast opposite the Israeli resort town of Eilat, was 
the last territory handed back, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the Sinai foundered under Egyptian control, in part because the 
Israelis destroyed much of the infrastructure they laid down during their 
15-year occupation. The Israeli settlement town of Yamit, near the northern 
city of Al Arish, still lies in bulldozed ruins as it was left by furious 
Israeli settlers when they were forced out by the Israeli army. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, Israeli experimental farms near Nuweiba, taken over by 
Egyptian Bedouins, fell into decline, and tourist villages built in the Israeli 
era languished along the Sinai coastline. Bedouin fishermen damaged the coral 
reefs of the eastern coast by dynamiting their catch, and a massive land grab 
by both Egyptian and foreign investors for tourist hotel development near the 
peninsula's southern tip at Sharm el Sheik threatened to irreparably befoul the 
pristine environment of the southern Sinai, with its untouched mountain 
valleys, clear turquoise waters and colorful underwater marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, Egypt, under massive pressure from international 
environmental groups, has set up a controlled development plan that is 
maximizing hotel construction along the eastern coast while imposing strict 
requirements on water desalination, garbage disposal and sewage treatment 
systems. The system should guarantee protection of the natural wonders that 
attract tourist dollars. Now, about 750 square miles of southern Sinai -- or 
52% of the Aqaba coast -- have been set aside as part of a national protected 
area that joins the Ras Muhammad National Park on the tip of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were convinced by the economic argument that you needed to protect the 
resources if you were going to develop resource-based tourism, and now they're 
very serious about it," said Michael P. Pearson, project manager for the Ras 
Muhammad preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth in southern Sinai has been unprecedented, increasing from 1,030 hotel 
beds in 1988 to 5,276 at present. That number is expected to more than double 
by 1995, producing a 1,005% growth rate over just seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharm el Sheik, the sun-washed enclave that held barely three hotels and a few 
apartment buildings when the Israelis left in 1982, is alive today with the 
sound of bulldozers, hammers and drills. The last remaining seafront along 
scenic Naama Bay and the surrounding bluffs are being filled in with hotels and 
restaurants. Everyone from Israeli hoteliers to actor Omar Sharif to the sons 
of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have claimed pieces of the action, and land 
prices have soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian entrepreneurs are backing the most massive project to date, the 
$88-million Sheik Coast development, just north of Sharm el Sheik, which will 
include a 300-room hotel, apartments, private villas and a huge jetty reaching 
into the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Hisham Gabr, 33, an anthropology graduate of the American University of Cairo, 
was one of the first to capitalize on the building boom, moving from Cairo in 
1982 to open the first private diving center in Sharm el Sheik. He reflects 
upon what it has meant for young Egyptians to come to the Sinai and, finally, 
embrace the peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I decided to come here, I said OK, the reality today is that our 
generation is dealing with the conflict between Egypt and Israel," Gabr said. 
"We do not have any choices to make. We are dealing with the leftovers of 
whatever our parents and grandparents have done. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to Egyptian belief, Israelis took Palestine by force. And according 
to the belief of an Israeli of my generation, he was brought up in a house 
where his father lived, so it is home for him. How many of us are willing to go 
through, at the end of the 20th Century, the moral and ethical questions of: 
'Was my grandfather right to take this place? And are these debts legitimate 
today? Or has so much time passed that I am no longer responsible. . . .?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I have made the choice willingly to participate in the development of this 
area. I see that the development of Sinai is definitely a personal statement, 
and not just a political act. I am a young Egyptian, I'm fed up with Cairo, 
from the crowds, from the pollution, and I need a meaning for my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The diving center, which Gabr opened when he was 26 with a loan from the 
National Bank of Egypt, is now undergoing a $3.2-million expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Just down the street, Adly Mestekawy, who opened one of the first private 
Egyptian hotels in southern Sinai, has expanded his holdings to include an 
experimental farm that is producing oranges, figs, olives and landscape 
greenery, partially with reclaimed sewage water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis left, and there was nothing here. It was for us the Wild West, 
and I'm one of the cowboys who rode in first," Mestekawy said. "From the first 
moment, I said the Israelis have left a mine of gold, and we have only to 
exploit it. There were no people, no businessmen, nothing -- only Bedouins 
without the knowledge and the know-how to exploit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Further up the coast, toward Dahab, hundreds of Bedouins, who for years roamed 
the deep valleys and coastal plains with their flocks, have since the Israeli 
invasion begun settling in and opening up shops, traditional tent-style 
coffeehouses and bamboo crash pads -- often as cheap as $1.25 a night -- for 
the youthful low-budget tourists who find in Sinai a remnant of 1960s 
California. Tie-dyed T-shirts and hashish are hot sellers on the lazy road that 
winds along the Dahab coast. The music of Lynard Skynard and Russian choruses 
filters out of coffeehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 But even they find themselves squeezed in by the five-star hotels that are 
pushing up on all sides. And the Bedouin entrepreneurs see yet another way of 
life nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is good, but it's not for everybody. And the Bedouins in Dahab, they 
have land to sell, but so what, after they've sold it, what do they have left?" 
asked Embarak Hamid Sobieh, a Bedouin who began his sedentary days as a driver 
for the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he bought land for 30 cents a square meter, opened a major tourist 
complex north of Dahab at Shark's Bay and often takes the opportunity to 
deplore the evils of Egyptian bureaucracy that have forced him over the years 
to obtain licenses and permits to stay in business. Most of the Bedouins are 
like Sobieh. They miss the ready jobs and free food handouts that came with the 
Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government asks me, who are all these Israeli tourists who come to Egypt 
and say, 'Where is Embarak? Where is Embarak?' " he said, chuckling. "I tell 
them, 'I'm a Bedouin. If they come, I eat with them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In blustery northern Sinai, where the Peace Canal is being built, the business 
focus is partly on tourism but primarily on the coming boom in nearby Gaza, 
which is scheduled for self-rule under the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian peace 
talks. The Egyptian Sinai towns of Al Arish and Rafah, just outside the Gaza 
territory, expect that they will host contractors from around the world who 
will rebuild Gaza, a Palestinian city under Israeli control for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course there are big hopes. This nation is right next door; there is only 
a barbed wire between us. We are enthusiastic to make that step," said Said 
Jomaa Shehata, manager of the North Sinai Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptian governor of northern Sinai, Mounir Shash, said the region is 
expected to grow from 215,000 people to more than 3 million, with an increase 
of more than 1 million in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Sinai was liberated, we began from zero. There was nothing at all, 
either from infrastructure or services. Now, let anyone from Israel come and 
see what happened in the Sinai, and he will have a reply," he said, pointing to 
Egypt's $430-million investment in schools, roads, power plants, telephones and 
water facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water from the Salaam Canal will be the new blood to Sinai to make a new 
society," he said. "So it is a new future. Everything will be changed here. 
With everything beginning from zero, you can create the society you want. There 
are no restrictions. Everything is possible." The Peace Canal 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt's $1.4 billion project will bring fresh water from the Nile to the Sinai 
peninsula.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin is scheduled to visit Georgia on Wednesday 
in his first trip to a former Soviet republic since the Dec. 12 Russian 
parliamentary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgian leader Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the visit "will signify the 
recognition of Georgia's independence," but Yeltsin's conduct will be 
scrutinized for clues about Russia's new policy toward the nations of the "near 
abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has supplied troops to help Shevardnadze put down an armed rebellion, 
and Georgia has joined the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States. The 
leaders will sign agreements on friendship, free trade and economic 
cooperation.

THE WEEK AHEAD: ISLAMABAD; SEPARATIST SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across Pakistan on Saturday, shops should remain shuttered and bazaars eerily 
silent as the country observes a government-endorsed general strike to show 
solidarity with the people of Kashmir.  
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has swung her support behind the action, 
originally called by an all-party parliamentary committee in support of 
militants waging a separatist campaign in India's only Muslim-majority 
state.But the stakes don't just concern Kashmir.  
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto's image has taken a beating lately due to a messy political feud with 
her family. Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif, who came out earlier for the 
strike, accuses her of not uttering a single word in defense of the Kashmiris. 
By calling on Pakistanis to stay away from work for a day, Bhutto is trying to 
keep from being outflanked on a hot-button issue by her enemies.

INSIDER; MONEY GETS STARRING ROLE ON DIPLOMATIC STAGE; THE TREASURY SECRETARY'S 
TRAVELS FROM MOSCOW TO TOKYO SHOWED HOW FOREIGN POLICY AND THE WORLD ECONOMY 
HAVE BECOME NEARLY ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the first day of the recent U.S.-Russian summit, American business 
executives in Moscow were treated to a rare, but telling sight: Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher standing at a lectern in an elegant hotel dining room, 
stalling for time because the featured speaker was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The speaker was Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Unfortunately, Christopher 
told guests at the first luncheon session of the American Chamber of Commerce 
in Moscow, Bentsen was at that moment with President Clinton presenting a 
central element of U.S. foreign policy to Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new world that continues to unfold with the collapse of the East-West 
rivalry, the scene at the lectern in the Metropole Hotel two weeks ago -- the 
secretary of state playing warm-up act to the secretary of the Treasury who was 
delayed by a meeting at the Kremlin -- said it all: The conduct of foreign 
policy and the stewardship of the international economy have become nearly 
inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are arenas in which a clearly drawn line still divides the 
two. But in an increasing number of instances, that division is becoming 
blurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's 12-day journey across Asia, which began in Moscow and ended in Tokyo 
with stops along the way in Indonesia, Thailand and China, sought to 
dramatically set this new diplomacy apart from the past. And it served to 
underscore the new reality that the success of the domestic economy is now 
intertwined not only with the prosperity of traditional U.S. trading partners 
in Europe but, more than ever, with Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The international economy is central to our economic prospects, and to our 
domestic economic policy," Bentsen said. The Moscow summit, with its focus on 
financial matters -- in effect, the diplomacy of business rather than the 
business of diplomacy -- made it clear, he added: "Economic policy is an 
increasingly important dimension of foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lesson carried over to a large degree from the last presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy played a crucial role in Clinton's victory -- it was George Bush's 
concentration on traditional security issues that helped cement the impression 
among voters that he had let the economy go down the tubes while focusing on 
distant trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
 During its first year in office, the Administration had its problems dealing 
with more traditional foreign policy dilemmas such as Bosnia, Somalia and 
Haiti. But it succeeded on such economic issues as the North American Free 
Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is more comfortable with economic issues than he is with 
foreign policy, so when he thinks internationally, he is more comfortable 
turning to his economic team for advice," said a senior Administration official 
with ties to the Clinton campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor, Administration officials say, involves the personalities of 
the key players. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen is accustomed to an out-front role on Capitol Hill, they note. He was 
groomed for a life in the public eye, growing up as the scion of a wealthy 
Texas rancher. His association with an issue -- in this case the foreign policy 
side of the economy -- elevates it. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, who hails from hardscrabble North Dakota, played the role of 
loyal deputy in the Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter administrations. He was 
a successful Los Angeles lawyer known for favoring careful, precise, private 
negotiating over courtroom theatrics. His association with an issue is more 
likely to sweep it into the back rooms of policy debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Disappearance of the political and military tensions that dominated America's 
relationship with the Soviet Union has clearly tipped the scales. "Relatively 
speaking, the economy is more important; it is not more important in and of 
itself," said Brent Scowcroft, Bush's White House national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 But at its heart, the merged roles of economics and diplomacy in such 
circumstances as the Moscow summit demonstrate the evolution that is under way. 
So it is that the secretary of state would address a Chamber of Commerce 
luncheon in Moscow, while the secretary of the Treasury, in Beijing, would make 
the connection between key political and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a secretary of state willing to raise economic issues and a 
secretary of the Treasury willing to raise human rights issues," a senior 
Treasury official said, referring to Christopher's speech on the Russian 
economy and Bentsen's linkage of Chinese prison labor to the troubled extension 
of trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 As Administration policy-makers see it, economic improvements lead to 
political stability, which leads to respect for human rights, which leads to 
yet greater prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, human rights and economic progress can and often do go together," 
said a senior Treasury official. For example, he said, linking human rights 
standards to extension of China's trade benefits "will support economic reform, 
and economic reform will in turn help support human rights," creating "a 
virtuous circle in which progress in human rights abets further (political) 
opening abets economic development abets human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Clinton Administration focusing on the role of exports in fueling 
economic growth, just as the Bush Administration did before it, it has not been 
lost on senior officials that the percentage of the gross national product 
attributed to foreign trade has grown. Roughly 5% of the GNP came from foreign 
trade in the 1960s. Now, roughly 10% is pegged to trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is politics as much as technology that determines the level and quantity 
of trade," a senior Treasury official said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is merit in the linkage that is taking place between economics and 
diplomacy, said Scowcroft: "We're at that kind of intersection where real 
progress in world economic relationships may be possible. There can be a lot of 
tying together that substitutes for the unity that came in opposing the Soviet 
threat." 
</P>
<P>
 But, there is also danger: As political leaders find their national economies 
growing ever more intertwined with the world economy and less open to domestic 
control, they could turn to protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk that must be avoided, he said, is that Washington -- or other 
capitals -- can place such a great dependence on international economic 
connections that "the key controls pass out of national hands," leaving the 
domestic economy captive of forces beyond the control of the political leaders.

PROFILE; A POLITICAL CRUSADER SUITS UP AGAIN; RAFAEL CALDERA IS BACK AS 
VENEZUELA'S LEADER. BUT WILL HE TAKE HIS COUNTRY INTO THE FUTURE OR INTO THE 
PAST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rafael Caldera first ran for president in 1947. Harry S. Truman was in the 
White House, and Venezuela was an economic mess governed by corrupt and 
inefficient autocrats with a restless military looking over their shoulders. 
The 31-year-old candidate was viewed as a loose cannon of national politics, 
and he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Time has passed, but much remains the same. Venezuela is again an economic 
mess, its last government was corrupt and inefficient, and the military looms 
ominously in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 The big difference is that Caldera will become president Wednesday, having 
defeated 17 other candidates in national elections Dec. 5. But even now 
Caldera, 78, is seen as a loose cannon, a crusader trying to re-create himself 
and his country in the image of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, at least, it is a pretty impressive past. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldera was born to well-off parents in the rural community of San Felipe in 
1916. He was educated in private Roman Catholic schools until attending the 
Central University of Venezuela, where he studied to be a lawyer. He also 
started a family, marrying Alicia Pietri, from an influential Caracas family, 
and fathering six children. 
</P>
<P>
 He was politically minded almost from the beginning, writing articles while in 
college about the need to modernize Venezuela and to create an updated labor 
movement. He also led a student political movement, which in combination with 
all his critical writings led to his arrest in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't slow him down. He learned six languages fluently, became a professor 
of sociology and, over his lifetime, has written or edited at least 20 books. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was politics that drove Caldera. He ran successfully for Congress in 
1941 and in 1946 was the key figure in creating Venezuela's first modern 
political party, the Committee for Independent Electoral and Political 
Organization, known by its Spanish acronym, COPEI. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venezuela of those days was a tough place politically. After he lost the 
presidency in 1947, the military took power. Caldera's stringent opposition led 
to his arrest in 1957 and exile the next year. He returned with democracy in 
1959, resumed his leadership of COPEI, running for president four more times, 
including a winning candidacy in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 His five-year term was remarkable. In line with the exploitation of the 
Western Hemisphere's largest oil reserves, Caldera followed economic theories 
then popular in Latin America: massive government intervention, nationalization 
of major industries, subsidies to a middle class he essentially created. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a country where politicians expect to get rich in office (two recent 
presidents have been charged with corruption crimes), Caldera built a 
reputation for honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a golden age, but one that began to collapse at the end of his term. 
Venezuela began a roller-coaster ride of boom and bust according to the price 
of oil. By the end of the 1980s, the country was in a trough, hard-hit by low 
oil prices, rising debt, a government manacled by corruption and an inefficient 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, both his party and his major opponents turned toward a 
free-market economy along with an opening within the political structure aimed 
at internal democracy. Caldera was turned out as leader of COPEI and ultimately 
quit the party and formed a new organization that was based almost entirely on 
his own personality and ideas. And that is how he ran for president last year 
in his sixth try. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campaign was a crusade on his own behalf, a very personal effort, to 
convince the country and the world that he was the only one to save Venezuela 
from the clutches of degrading moral and economic policies," said a diplomat 
who has served here for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a real party or permanent organization, the diplomat said, 
Caldera won because "he showed a tremendous personal display of vitality, of 
energy and political judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign stifled rumors that he is too old, even senile, for the job. 
Aides say he wrote his own speeches, never canceled a campaign appearance and 
was always in control. "It is amazing," said another diplomat who has dealt 
with Caldera for many years. "He never seemed tired and he never was 
distracted. . . . I don't like his policies, but if anyone can make them work, 
it is Caldera." 
</P>
<P>
 A Venezuelan attorney who served in Caldera's first presidency remarked: "He 
always was an autocrat, and he remains one. In 1968 (when he was previously 
elected) he needed a party, but it was one he founded, so it did what he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this campaign. When his party (COPEI) rejected him, he rejected them 
and ran on his own without compromise. He told anyone who agreed to support him 
they did it on their own, that they would owe him and not the other way around. 
He made sure they knew there would be no electoral spoils." 
</P>
<P>
 Can it work? It is unlikely, according to most authorities. Caldera wants to 
reverse many of the free-market policies put in place over the last five years, 
including nullification of a national sales tax, privatization of industries, 
cuts in subsidies that keep gasoline prices at 20 cents a gallon and a 
renegotiation of the country's massive external debt. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this will require congressional approval, again an unlikely proposition 
given that among Venezuela's legislative blocs, Caldera's is the smallest and 
most fractured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caldera is a powerful man," one former ally said, "and he is counting on the

MEDIA; POLAND'S PREMIER OF PRANKS PREVAILS; JANUSZ WEISS KEEPS 'EM LAUGHING -- 
AND THINKING -- ON RADIO ZET BY TESTING THE LIMITS OF TOLERANCE.

<P>
 The recently returned Polish emigre was frustrated at the lack of snow in his 
yard and had learned during his stay in America that money could buy anything. 
</P>
<P>
 So he called a trucking company and asked it to deliver snow from the Tatra 
Mountains so his children could build snowmen in still-green Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucking company employee was uncertain. "OK, I'll call your competitor," 
the businessman threatened. No, no, came the reply over the phone, they would 
deliver the snow immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotcha!  
</P>
<P>
 Poland's premier prankster, Janusz Weiss, is at it again -- and much of Warsaw 
is listening in on Radio Zet. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland's first private radio station has revolutionized broadcasting in this 
former Communist country where all radio and television used to be under state 
control. And one of Radio Zet's star attractions is Weiss, with his daily 
telephone practical jokes -- a sophisticated version of the American 
third-grader's "Do you have Prince Albert in a can?" 
</P>
<P>
 But it is more than comedy. Weiss, a longtime underground cabaret performer in 
the Communist days, has gleaned important insights into what the Polish 
capital's residents are thinking about these days. And the two main themes are: 
How far has capitalism progressed, and do we really have civil rights in the 
face of the formerly totalitarian government? 
</P>
<P>
 "People like very much to check what they can do and what they can't," Weiss 
said in an interview. "These people couldn't really order a truck full of snow 
because they don't have that much money. But they like to know this kind of 
thing is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Zet's listeners set the challenges for Weiss, who is part practical 
joker and part ombudsman. 
</P>
<P>
 They tape-record their dares, which are then vetted by a committee. If the 
idea is accepted, the listener gets 1 million zlotys -- about $50 -- which is a 
lot of money in Poland. If Weiss fails to pull off the suggestion, the listener 
gets another million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of tasks where I'm asked to present myself as a foreigner or a 
rich capitalist," said Weiss, 45, whose cabaret troupe was banned in 1975. He 
later ran an underground video parlor that showed banned films during the days 
after martial law was imposed at the end of 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss puts his acting talents to good use, using a variety of voices to 
improvise his unlikely phone conversations, which are broadcast live. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the challenges are strictly jokes -- such as trying to persuade the 
owner of a car wash to clean an elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 But others plumb the taboos of Polish society -- such as asking a cafe to 
organize a reception for a homosexual wedding (agreed). Or asking the city-run 
bus company to install condom-vending machines on buses. (Bureaucrats insisted 
that "society wouldn't accept it.") 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss' challenges also examine the contradictions in a country that remains 
heavily Roman Catholic despite having been Communist for 45 years. He recently 
stunned a worker at the ex-Communist Party's headquarters by announcing that 
the Warsaw bishop had agreed to bless the building. The man accepted the offer 
and even acceded to the request that two believers be present for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "No problem," the former Communist official said. "I myself was an acolyte." 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe owner Jurek Zaporski makes a point of tuning into Weiss' program every 
day. "Life is gray and difficult," Zaporski said. "It's so nice to hear 
something funny. It improves people's moods. People need something to make them 
relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Every third radio in Warsaw is tuned to Radio Zet (a snappier version of the 
station's original name, Radio Gazeta, or Radio Newspaper), which has built 
fortune and clout on a predictable American formula: rock music, news scoops, 
competitions, games and generous cash giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weiss show is only one of many ways that the station gets listeners 
involved. A telephone hot line -- "the red telephone" -- solicits news tips and 
pays the equivalent of an average month's salary for good ones. (Radio Zet 
gives away about $2,000 a day in prizes.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We always know which minister had too many drinks the night before and 
destroyed the restaurant," said the station's founder and biggest shareholder, 
Andrzej Woyciechowski. In one of the most astonishing tips, a policeman called 
in from the scene of a bank robbery before taking off in pursuit of the 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get 20 scoops a day," Woyciechowski boasts. "Every day we are quoted by 
(the Polish news agency) PAP. Two or three times a week we are quoted by (the 
Western news agencies) UPI, AP and Agence France-Presse." 
</P>
<P>
 Proud as he is of his news-gathering operation -- 70 of the station's 160 
employees are journalists -- Woyciechowski is also full of admiration for 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most difficult thing we do," Woyciechowski said of Weiss' 
program. "This requires great acting skills, lots of invention and a very big 
sense of humor. To be funny is always the most difficult thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss admitted that it is hard work, but he obviously enjoys it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very stressful," he said. "You have to be in good shape, but if I 
succeed, then I have very big satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 And even though he considers himself an expert on human behavior, the 
listeners sometimes astonish him.  
</P>
<P>
 In one recent prank, he pretended to be a talking computer, offering to 
fulfill the dream of just one person from the whole human race. 
</P>
<P>
 He instructed the woman who answered his call to speak her dream after three 
beeps. He waited for jokes -- or predictable greed for personal wealth. Instead 
there was a long silence, and then the wish: "May there be peace."

POSTSCRIPT; LEBANESE SITE CLAIMED FOR BIBLICAL MIRACLE; A PROFESSOR DISPUTES 
THE TRADITIONAL BELIEF THAT ISRAEL WAS WHERE JESUS TURNED WATER INTO WINE. 
TODAY, TOURIST DOLLARS ARE AT STAKE.

<P>
 In a region where land and religion are prime ingredients for war, the 
controversy raging in a small village in southern Lebanon was, at the very 
least, predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to the mix one of Christ's miracles, and the recipe was sure to draw 
attention to the sleepy village of Qana. And all Qana's elders wanted was a 
place on the world's lucrative tourist maps of religious antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
 It started last year when Youssef Hourani challenged modern interpretations of 
Christ's miracle of turning water into wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourani did not dispute St. John's account of what happened that day. But he 
disputed where it took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourani, a Lebanese professor, presented what he said was a wealth of 
linguistic and physical evidence documenting that the wedding where the miracle 
occurred did not take place, as traditionally accepted, in the Galilee region 
of Israel that English-language Scriptures call Cana. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the professor said, it was performed in the hillside village of Qana, 
where archeologists have found 13 ancient, carved statues that Hourani and 
others claim represent Christ and his 12 disciples. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourani also presented the writings of theologians from the 3rd and 4th 
centuries that he contends support his theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Few took note, though, until the Pope got involved. 
</P>
<P>
 A prominent Lebanese political leader, Lebanon's parliamentary Speaker Nabih 
Berri, paid a call on Pope John Paul II last November and presented him with a 
file supporting Hourani's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Berri, a Muslim, has invited the Pope to visit the site, which includes a cave 
where Qana's Christian minority have been worshiping for centuries and is said 
to have sheltered Jesus and his companions at the time of the wedding.  
</P>
<P>
 Developments began to get touchy after Berri's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the townspeople of Qana are Shiite Muslims, and when a radical Islamic 
sheik aligned with the Shiite Hezbollah organization caught wind of it, he 
plunked down two foundation stones at the entrance to the cave and vowed to 
build a mosque there. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Shiite cleric said flatly: "We don't want the Pope in Lebanon," which 
has a large and powerful Christian minority. 
</P>
<P>
 As the controversy intensified, the most rational voices in Lebanon have been 
those of archeologists who have yet to visit the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourani was introduced to Qana in 1969, when he was invited to a dinner there. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meal, his host led a tour of the archeological sites in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that day, Hourani, a professor of history and philosophy who specializes 
in Canaanite culture, has been building his case for Qana El-Jaleel (Qana of 
Galilee), the full name of the hillside village. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourani's first line of scholarly defense against the doubting Thomases is 
linguistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Village names in south Lebanon have stayed the same for thousands of years, 
Hourani points out. He is armed with ancient maps and texts that he says show 
the name of Qana El-Jaleel has indeed referred to this town since Pharaonic 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Down-to-earth evidence also exists. Three stone water pots excavated in Qana 
in the 1960s were used by Jesus at the Wedding of Cana depicted in the Gospel, 
Hourani insists -- although there is no proven connection between Christ and a 
particular artifact. Nor is this the first case of disputed locations in 
biblical history. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Middle East is replete with them. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Kafr Kanna, the village in the Galilee region of Israel, Hourani argues 
that it has no linguistic connection with the name of the Lebanese town, which 
he insists makes a proper Canaanite connection to the time of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 He says other biblical authorities have their doubts about the village in 
Galilee as well, suggesting that it was a pious guess that was honored as the 
site of the miracle mainly because of its accessibility for early Christian 
pilgrims visiting nearby Nazareth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Lebanese Qana, today's pilgrims face a problem of 
inaccessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The cave and carvings are located on a steep hillside. Winter rains have 
turned it into a treacherous descent. Visitors gladly accept the helping hands 
of Lebanese army regulars who are stationed at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather-worn carvings are viewed by most visitors as little more than a 
curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 The real object of veneration is the cave where Christ and his disciples are 
believed to have stayed while attending the wedding. The water that seeps from 
the cave roof is claimed to have healing properties and makes the spot as 
popular among Muslims as Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese soldiers use the cave as a barracks. Their cots provide a resting 
place for the exhausted pilgrims. Army field phones share the ledges of the 
cave with remnants of pilgrims' candles. 
</P>
<P>
 The army's presence put a stop to graffiti but not the littering of the area 
with film boxes, soft drink cans and snack wrappers. Nor did it catch the 
hammer-toting vandal who recently scarred another carving that local Christians 
believe represents the biblical bride of Qana. 
</P>
<P>
 Berri, a longtime friend of Hourani, is the man of the hour in the town. 
</P>
<P>
 When trouble began brewing between the Hezbollah sheik who threatened to build 
a mosque at the site and the Shiite owner of the property, the owner gave the 
land to Berri. Berri has made it clear that the site will stand as is, a 
Christian shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the conversion of water into wine, Qana's abstaining Muslims only 
say: "Why would a holy man turn perfectly good drinking water into wine?" 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Beirut, meanwhile, the campaign is underway to get Qana placed on the 
lucrative map of religious antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
 The minister of tourism decreed the village an official tourist and 
archeological site. Brochures and posters on Qana will be distributed through 
Lebanese embassies across the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly the tourist infrastructure of Qana -- with its 10,000 inhabitants 
-- has a way to go. None of the sites is marked. Parking for the carvings and 
caves is a construction site. The guides are hordes of little boys who 
sure-footedly leap ahead, leaving the pilgrim to fend for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The best post-pilgrimage sustenance in town is available at Hassan's 
restaurant, a three-table affair serving grilled chicken. The sign outside 
reads, Vale Ni Kana Toa. That's Fijian for "house where you eat chicken" and 
testament to the cultural stew of southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1978, more than 5,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops from 10 countries have 
been stationed in the region. The battalion in the Qana area is Fijian, and 
many of its soldiers are Hassan's customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospitality at Hassan's is warm; the chicken is piping hot. Lebanese 
currency or dollars are both welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you want wine with your meal, you'll have to perform the miracle 
yourself.

CULTURE; SLOVENIA ABUZZ OVER ITS UNIQUE BEEHIVE ART; EFFORTS TO PRESERVE THE 
PAINTINGS GET THE GOVERNMENT STIRRED UP OVER NATIONALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Josip Virient returned from America in 1920 with plans to revolutionize 
Slovenia's beekeeping industry with big, modern hives, he probably had no idea 
he was killing one of the most distinctive features of Slovene culture. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost two centuries, Slovenian beekeepers had been the patrons of a 
unique art form. They had paid itinerant artists in the southernmost reaches of 
the Austro-Hungarian Empire to paint the front boards of their drawer-like 
Kranjic hives with colorful scenes from the Bible, folk tales and history. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the gentlemen farmers of the region switched to the larger and more 
productive hives that Virient had seen across the Atlantic, the practice of 
front board painting went the way of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't find these anywhere else in the world. They may be the only thing 
that is truly Slovenian, as our culture has always been influenced by those who 
ruled us," said Ida Gnilsak, curator of the apicultural museum in this town 
that for centuries was at the center of the empire's beekeeping crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the architecture throughout Slovenia is definitively Hapsburg, with 
traces of Italian influence on the coast and plenty of the box-like concrete 
structures that are a legacy of the Communist era. The Slovenian language is 
closely related to other Slavic tongues in Eastern Europe. Even the people 
descend from the same 6th-Century migration that brought Serbs and Croats to 
the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Slovenes took to painting the covers of beehives more than 200 years ago 
remains a mystery here, even among the handful of people who have made 
preservation of the folk art their lives' work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think the beekeepers wanted to make sure their bees could 
identify their own hives, but that doesn't make sense since bees had known for 
centuries before the painting started how to find their way home," said 
Gnilsak. "I think people living here just wanted them for aesthetic reasons. 
They also painted their furniture at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest example of embellished beehive doors dates to 1758 and depicts the 
Madonna and child. 
</P>
<P>
 Biblical scenes were prevalent during the first decades of the short-lived 
art, with most boards from the late 18th Century recounting stories of Adam and 
Eve, Noah's Ark, the Last Supper and the lives of saints. Later, in what is 
considered the golden age of apiary art (1820-1880), humor and folk tales 
dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 Several expressions of the "upside-down world" parody the relationship between 
animals and man. One front board displayed at the apiculture museum shows a 
cocky band of animals carrying off a trussed hunter as they smoke and banter on 
their way home from the kill. In another, the famous Huntsman's Funeral, a fox 
weeps and deer solemnly march with candles as a bear prepares to bury their 
human tormentor. 
</P>
<P>
 One of apiary art's most important contributions, according to Ethnographic 
Museum director Gorazd Makarovic, is that it provides a physical representation 
of folk tales otherwise passed down only through oral stories and songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those unfamiliar with Slovenian folklore scratch their heads at scenes 
involving men's pant being boiled for soup, fought over in a tug of war or 
dangled before pretty maidens. A Slovenian folk tale holds that a young girl on 
her death bed recovered after touching a pair of men's pants, and thus ascribes 
curative powers to certain types of suspendered breeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the 19th Century, morality became a prominent theme for the 
front boards. Women were often depicted hauling their husbands out of bars by 
the hair or upbraiding their laziness as the men lay asleep in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the front boards were painted by the beekeepers themselves, according 
to Gnilsak. Instead, artists who found themselves unsuited to the confines of 
the protocol-bound Hapsburg court would take to the road, roaming the rural 
reaches of the empire and exchanging their talent for stipends or simply room 
and board. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovenes put the traveling painters to work on their beehives, encouraging a 
few of the artists to specialize in the odd art form. Among the most notable 
was Leopold Layer of nearby Kranj, a nobleman whose penchant for gambling led 
him to counterfeiting and a term in jail before he found his niche as a front 
board painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnographic records show that the practice of painting front boards was 
ubiquitous throughout what is now Slovenia, with any self-respecting beekeeper 
having commissioned the decoration of each of his hives. Some also hired 
sculptors to fashion special hives out of wood. The Radovljica museum houses 
several carved figures, including a Turkish soldier and a likeness of Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
 The art of decorating beehives died abruptly after World War I, when Slovenia 
became part of Yugoslavia and lost its role as imperial honey producer. At this 
time, Virient introduced other apiculturists to the more efficient Western 
hives. A similar model subsequently developed here remains popular today with 
both professional and amateur beekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Apiary art drew no attention until its practice became extinct, largely 
because Austrian administrators regarded the painted front boards as primitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with little more than a thousand of the naive front board paintings 
surviving in a handful of Slovenian museums and in the homes of private 
collectors, art historians are tangling with politicians over how to preserve 
and present their endangered cultural species. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians want a prominent venue for apiary art and other ethnographic 
exhibits, while officials in the capital of Ljubljana are wary of devoting 
precious resources to a museum some see as a potentially worrisome nationalist 
attempt to forge a Slovenian identity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethnographic Museum in Ljubljana currently has none of its inventory of 
nearly 500 painted front boards on display because it has the use of only two 
small rooms for exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've begun to publish our collections in books because of the lack of 
space," complained exhibits director Inja Smerdel, brandishing a thick, glossy 
catalogue of the stored front boards and the history of Slovenian apiculture, 
titled "The Man and the Bee." 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials have been lobbying for years to get their own building, as 
the ethnographic displays are squeezed out by the national art gallery on the 
premises. But Parliament has rejected proposals to convert several centrally 
located buildings, vacated by the Yugoslav federal government after Slovenia's 
1991 secession, into an ethnographic museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if they are afraid of showing too much," Smerdel said of Slovenian 
officials, who have shown a determination to discourage the nationalism that 
afflicts much of the rest of the former Yugoslav federation. "We don't want to 
make a museum of national identity. We just want to show the accumulated 
knowledge of our society." 
</P>
<P>
 But, for the time being, the ethnographic history of Slovenia is viewable only 
at provincial museums, and the only sizable display of the apiary art that is 
unique to the Slovenes is in this humble mountain village an hour's drive north 
of the capital.

MARKET SCENE; CHILEANS SAVOR SWEET ADVANTAGE IN FRUIT INDUSTRY; THE SOUTH 
AMERICAN NATION IS THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPORTER OF WINTER FRUIT. MORE THAN 40% 
GOES TO THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a busy summer day in a sun-splashed orchard, workers hurry to harvest a 
bumper crop of plump and blushing nectarines, spilling them from baskets into a 
trailer parked between rows of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 A tractor will take the nectarines to a nearby packing plant, where they will 
cool off in a huge refrigeration chamber. In a few days, after sorting and 
packing, the fruit will be trucked to Valparaiso and loaded on refrigerated 
ships going to the United States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're starting to send a lot of fruit to the United States, East 
Coast and West Coast," said Ricardo Vial, export manager for a group of farms 
here. As he strolled through an orchard, Vial listed some of the fruit he will 
be sending to California in the coming weeks: "nectarines, peaches, plums, 
grapes -- a lot of them -- and pears." 
</P>
<P>
 Chile is the world's leading exporter of "winter fruit" (not counting citrus, 
bananas and other tropical fruit), harvested when trees are bare in most of the 
Northern Hemisphere. Chilean fruit exports have grown into almost a 
billion-dollar industry, helping to nourish this South American country's 
remarkable economic development in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Depressed prices for apples in Europe made 1993 a disappointing year for many 
Chilean fruit growers. But as this season's harvest goes into high gear, they 
are expecting a happier 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, Coltauco agriculture was mostly annual crops such as corn 
and wheat, wine vineyards, and dairy herds and other livestock. Only a few 
farmers were beginning to grow fruit for export. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather Miguel started with nectarines around 1965," Vial said. "He 
exported to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, like many rural areas of central Chile, the township of Coltauco, 70 
miles south of Santiago, relies on fruit exports as a major source of 
livelihood. This is a patchwork quilt of orchards and vineyards, dotted with 
refrigeration and packing plants where workers process fruit with modern 
conveyor equipment, and where office personnel keep track of business with 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Chilean Exporters Assn., the export of fruits and vegetables 
directly employs 4.4% of the Chilean labor force, or more than 200,000 workers. 
While many of the jobs are low-skill, the export industry has increased 
opportunities for better-paid equipment operators, technicians and clerical 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile accounts for about 45% of the Southern Hemisphere's exports of apples, 
pears, peaches and table grapes, up from 4% in the early 1960s. From 1986 to 
1991 alone, Chile's fresh fruit exports increased by 69%, from 665,000 to 1.1 
million metric tons. More than 40% goes to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Chilean fruit exports brought in less than $200 million. This year's 
revenues are expected to surpass the 1991 record of $991 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's revenues dropped to $862 million, mainly because of low apple 
prices in Europe. The problem started with a bumper crop of European apples, 
which can be stored into the winter season. Amid fears that the oversupply 
might prompt the European Community to impose a system of licensing apple 
imports, Chilean exporters rushed shipments to get their apples in before any 
quotas were set. 
</P>
<P>
 The glut brought prices down rapidly. The European Community -- now called the 
European Union -- levied heavy compensatory import taxes on imported apples. 
With the added taxes, Chilean producers could not cover their costs. Uncounted 
acres of apples were left unpicked, and big growers lost millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional problem that made things worse for Chile was its lack of quality 
control. With no industrywide grading system to separate high- and low-quality 
fruit, mediocre Chilean apples pulled down prices for the good ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation has been proposed to impose an industrywide system of grading for 
export fruit, but passage appears uncertain. Meanwhile, many growers and 
exporters have agreed to start a voluntary system of quality certification. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as it isn't obligatory, it's going to be hard to make quality control 
effective," predicted Ramon Achurra, a Coltauco grower and exporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Chilean growers worry that Chile's quality control problem eventually 
could seriously erode this country's share of the winter fruit market as other 
Southern Hemisphere countries push to increase their shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In South America, Argentina is a major fruit exporter and Brazil has big 
potential for exporting winter fruits. South Africa and New Zealand are also 
important Southern Hemisphere producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina already exports more pears than Chile and almost as many apples. But 
Chile's overall fruit exports are more than double Argentina's. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa and New Zealand have been successful at developing new varieties 
of fruit that capture consumer perference. Smart Chilean growers have been able 
to follow suit, planting the new varieties as their popularity increases. For 
example, new red apple varieties that are spreading in Chile include the Royal 
Gala, the Braeburn and the Fuji. 
</P>
<P>
 Chileans also have ventured successfully into new species after spotting 
potential markets that they can supply. They planted some 27,000 acres of kiwi, 
winning a big share of the 1980s boom in that fruit, and more recently they 
have been investing heavily in berries for export. 
</P>
<P>
 A new entry in the Chilean export cornucopia is the cherimoya, a delicious 
custard fruit of Andean origin that recently has been approved for marketing in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile holds its biggest advantage in table grapes, nectarines and peaches, 
with more than 80% of the Southern Hemisphere's total exports. Table grapes are 
Chile's biggest export crop by far, and most go to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 58.3 million boxes of Chilean fruit and vegetables sent to the United 
States during the season that ended last August, 16.3 million boxes went to the 
West Coast, and all but 300,000 of those were unloaded at the Port of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Europe buy three-fourths of Chile's fruit exports. 
Exporters are trying to diversify the market, with notable success. Last year, 
sales to Latin America doubled, accounting for 14% of total fruit exports. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has been a very pleasant surprise for us," said Ronald Bown Fernandez, 
president of the Chilean Exporters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth in fruit exports to many countries has been slowed in recent years by 
international recession. But Bown predicted in an interview that economic 
recovery in the United States and other northern countries will stimulate the 
world's appetite for fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be an excellent business for Chile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Chile's Mediterranean climate, with rainy winters and sunny summers, 
give it natural advantages for fruit production. Low labor costs, relatively 
inexpensive land and a stable business climate favoring free enterprise and 
international trade have encouraged investment in fruit since the 1970s, Bown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile's fruit-growing area has expanded to nearly 400,000 acres from 116,000 
acres in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Bown said he is not worried that the Northern Hemisphere's winter fruit market 
could become saturated by increased exports from Chile and other Southern 
Hemisphere countries. He cited a trend of increasing consumption of fruit and 
vegetables in developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The exporters association is contributing $30,000 this year to a U.S. 
publicity campaign encouraging consumers to eat at least five portions of 
fruits and vegetables a day for a healthy diet. The "five-a-day" campaign, 
started in California in 1988, is sponsored by the Produce for Better Health 
Foundation in cooperation with the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Bown said emphasis on healthier eating is expected to double per-capita fruit 
consumption in the United States within 10 years. And he said the movement is 
likely to spread to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilean exporters are also interested in joining U.S. produce organizations in 
promotional projects aimed at increasing demand for different kinds of fruit. 
The Chilean Exporters Assn. recently signed a preliminary agreement with the 
California Kiwi Fruit Commission for a campaign to promote "kiwi fruit of the 
Americas."

the board of directors. Philip J. Alford, senior vice president and chief 
financial officer, has been named acting president. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicars, the company's CEO since 1987, could not be reached for comment. But 
his abrupt resignation follows the loss of $10 million for the nine months 
ended Sept. 30, in contrast with a profit of $503,000 for the same period in 
1992. 
</P>

A NEW JACKSON ARRIVES; BASEBALL: BO PLAYS DOWN HIS ROLE WITH ANGELS. 'I'M A 
FOURTH OUTFIELDER,' HE TELLS PACKED NEWS CONFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was designed to be a news conference, but the moment the man walked through 
the door Monday afternoon, the Angels knew their image suddenly had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been years since they had this feeling, but for the first time since 
the Angels last had a Jackson on the field, they now have an identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie was the one responsible for delivering glamour and sex appeal to the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bo is bringing it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really never understood that magnetism he had," Angel General Manager Bill 
Bavasi said, "until today. It was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Edward Jackson, whom the world simply calls, "Bo," charmed, teased and 
mesmerized reporters and photographers for nearly an hour at Anaheim Stadium. 
It was the Angels' largest press conference since Reggie Jackson signed as a 
free agent in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 100 media representatives, including 12 TV crews. The entire 
front office of the Angels was there, no one wanted to miss the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson warned the assemblage that he's not a savior for the franchise. He 
even called himself a fourth outfielder, and said he wasn't trying to cost 
anyone a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it didn't matter. This is a guy who transcended two sports before Deion 
Sanders entertained the notion. This is a guy who is playing with an artificial 
hip, knowing it could go out at any time. This is charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who readily admit that Jackson will be an instant gate attraction 
-- but scoff at talk that it's the sole reason they signed him -- say this will 
be a cozy arrangement. Jackson will be paid $1 million if he makes the 
opening-day roster, but if he's cut in spring training, they're liable for only 
$300,000. Jackson can earn $2.2 million if he plays in 130 games, receiving a 
$200,000 bonus for every 10 games he plays beginning with the 80th and ending 
with the 130th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to take somebody's job," Jackson said. "I'm a fourth outfielder. 
My role is to play where I'm needed. I'm just here to be part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 While Jackson was talking as smoothly as a politician, he wasn't fooling 
anyone. He's not coming to California just to be close to Hollywood. He wants 
to play, whether it will be as the Angels' starting left fielder or their 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what he said," Bavasi said, "but I can't believe he goes back to 
Phoenix and works out just to be a fourth outfielder. No way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels already have a full-time DH in Chili Davis, who hit 27 homers and 
drove in 112 runs last season. They also have viable left fielders in Eduardo 
Perez and free agent Dwight Smith, who reached agreement with the Angels 
Monday. Of course, any conflict could be resolved by trading Davis, who's 
guaranteed $2.4 million this season and could earn $3.05 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no sacred cows here," Bavasi said. "This gives us flexibility that 
we didn't have before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying we're signing the same Bo Jackson. I mean, we wouldn't even be 
having this conversation if he had stayed away from football. This guy would 
have been absolutely phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then again, I wouldn't bet against him. If anybody wants to, I'll cover 
the action." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has spent his entire professional career making fools of those who 
dared to doubt him. 
</P>
<P>
 They said he never would play major league baseball after winning the Heisman 
Trophy in 1985. But he was playing for the Kansas City Royals eight months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 They said it was impossible to play two professional sports. But he was 
playing for the Raiders and Royals in 1987, earning All-Star and All-Pro honors 
in each sport. 
</P>
<P>
 They said he was finished as an athlete when he underwent hip replacement 
surgery in 1992. But he hit a home run in his first at-bat of the 1993 season 
for the Chicago White Sox, hitting .232 with 16 homers and 45 RBIs in 85 
games.. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thrived on that my entire life," Jackson said. "People told me I'd never 
amount to anything growing up. All I can say is, 'Look at me now, baby, look at 
me now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The latest challenge for Jackson is proving that the White Sox and the rest of 
the baseball world made a huge mistake when they didn't pursue him this winter. 
He became a free agent when the White Sox elected not to exercise his option, 
and with two weeks remaining before spring training, Jackson was without a job. 
</P>
<P>
 There still are those skeptical of Jackson's ability. The artificial hip 
greatly inhibits his flexibility, and he has difficulty handling an array of 
pitches. Yet, he still has average speed, a good arm and power that refuses to 
go away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wasn't so naturally strong," one rival American League executive said, 
"he wouldn't have a chance. There's only one zone where he can really handle 
the ball. But if you ask me, it's a good signing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't call this a gimmick thing because the Angels can really use this 
guy. He's still capable of hitting 20 homers and driving in 80 runs if he plays 
all season. When you think about it, the Angels don't have anything to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel President Richard Brown: "It's obvious that Bo is going to help 
sell some tickets because of his aura, but we would never bring in an 
individual just to sell tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 With Bo, it just goes with the territory.

GILLOOLY POINTS TO HARDING; FIGURE SKATING: LAWYER OF EX-HUSBAND SPEAKS OUT TO 
FORCE HER OFF U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest revelation of the figure skating saga, Tonya Harding's 
ex-husband has accused Harding of helping plan the attack on Nancy Kerrigan, 
his lawyer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer, Ronald Hoevet, said he divulged the accusation in hopes of forcing 
Harding off the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, she was in on it from the beginning," said Hoevet, who 
represents Jeff Gillooly. "That's what Jeff said. I believe that to be the 
truth. It will be corroborated by other evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding said last week she became aware of the plot only after the Jan. 6 
assault in Detroit where Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee after a practice 
session and forced to withdraw from the 1994 women's national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoevet said Harding was involved in planning the attack since early December, 
after she finished fourth at a competition in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 He said much of Gillooly's account could be corroborated by phone logs and 
bank records. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoevet said the U.S. Olympic Committee "cannot wait for the criminal justice 
system to run its course. That will not happen before the Olympics. She has at 
least violated the unsportsmanlike conduct code. They've got to find a way to 
take action." 
</P>
<P>
 The Winter Olympics begin Feb. 12 in Lillehammer, Norway, but U.S. officials 
have until Feb. 21 before committing to their figure skating team. If Harding 
is withdrawn, Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance would replace her. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they would release today portions of Harding's Jan. 18 
interview with authorities in which she implicated Gillooly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly, who had reconciled and lived with Harding at the time of the 
assault, is expected to plead guilty today to racketeering in county court, 
said Judy Snyder, Hoevet's law partner. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is expected to give his version of exactly what motivated the violent 
attempt to rig the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooding suspicions about the objectivity of judges and the fairness of 
scoring in women's figure skating might have motivated the attack on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Gillooly believed that his on-again, off-again spouse had been 
given a raw deal by skating judges, and that rival Kerrigan was plainly the 
favorite of the U.S. skating establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two events in particular were cited: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Resentment over what he and his ex-wife believed was unfair scoring of 
Harding's performances at an international competition in Japan in December. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cover-story treatment of Kerrigan in U.S. Figure Skating Assn. publications 
leading up to the Detroit national championships in January. 
</P>
<P>
 This account of investigators was published Monday in the Oregonian. The 
newspaper indicated it received the information from two days of interrogation 
Gillooly underwent at the FBI office in Portland last week. It was not verified 
by officials willing to speak publicly, or by court documents. Moreover, 
Gillooly's statements are sure to be subject of doubt and challenge in this 
strange case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly is believed to be seeking a reduced sentence by cooperating with the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's more detailed account of Gillooly's story added this: Harding's 
fourth-place finish in Japan so angered him that he began planning the assault 
on his own, and then discussed it with her. The skater's first reaction was to 
question whether Gillooly's associate and her acquaintance, Shawn Eckardt, was 
the right man for the job. Gillooly explained that Eckardt was only a 
go-between. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has denied knowing of the plot beforehand. But she has admitted 
learning of events afterward and not reporting this to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-member committee of the U.S. Figure Staking Assn. is to meet in 
Colorado today and begin deliberations on whether Harding should be 
disqualified from the Olympic competition Feb. 23 and 25. A decision is not 
expected until the end of the week, at the soonest. For now, she and Kerrigan 
are the U.S. team's two entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Phillip Knight, chief executive officer of Nike, said that the 
company would donate $25,000 to Harding to defend herself, should she be taken 
off the Olympic team. Harding is not affiliated with Nike, but the company is 
based in nearby Beaverton. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the last year, Harding has finished fourth in skating competitions 
and complained about the judging. 
</P>
<P>
 After the January 1993 U.S. championships in Phoenix, she told a Portland 
journalist that she got a raw deal. Kerrigan won that competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, after the NHK international competition in Japan Dec. 9-12, 
Harding returned unhappy with her scores -- particularly her low marks in the 
mandatory technical program. Harding did not fall but was scored lower than 
skaters who did. Kerrigan did not enter that event. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the account published Monday, Gillooly said he and Harding 
brooded over what they believed was favoritism toward Kerrigan by the USFSA. 
Mentioned was the cover story on Kerrigan in the association's monthly magazine 
in December. Also mentioned was a "brochure" that highlighted Kerrigan. This 
might have been the media guide for the Detroit competition, which featured 
Kerrigan and other 1993 U.S. champions on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledgeable skating enthusiasts noted, however, that Harding has been on the 
cover of the association magazine and was on the cover of at least one of the 
organization's brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 As an event that depends entirely on the opinion of a specialized clique of 
judges, and where style and presentation are hugely subjective, grumbling about 
scoring and favoritism is widespread.

 From one-handed pitchers to one-hipped outfielders, everyone is welcome with 
the California Angels. Becoming something of a foster home for unwanted 
baseball orphans, the Angels are now the temporary guardians of Vincent (Bo) 
Jackson, a man made of flesh, blood and plastic, who evidently had nowhere else 
to go after the heartless Chicago White Sox transformed him into Soxless Bo. 
</P>
<P>
 Like chicken soup, what we have here is a can't-hurt proposition for the 
Angels, who needed a little something to heat up their fans. Already a 
restaurant across the street from their stadium, along State College, had an 
employee clambering to the top of their roadside marquee Monday to arrange 
letters reading: "BO KNOWS SEAFOOD." And the knowledgeable Mr. Jackson himself 
already understands enough about life in California to know how he intends to 
live here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to rent," he jokes, "so if it tumbles down, I won't have to worry 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Been following the quake, Bo? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he says. "I hear the earthquake insurance people are trying to find 
somebody who'll cover them ." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for a better offer, Jackson was telling friends just a few days ago 
that he planned to spend the months to come motoring around on one of his four 
Harley-Davidson motorcycles, seeing America. Some of them now think he was 
putting them on, that Bo already had this arrangement with the Angels all lined 
up, and even he smiles mischievously now and says: "When they asked what I was 
going to do, I had to tell them something." 
</P>
<P>
 Straight answers can be so boring. Take the way Jackson responded during 
Monday's visit to his new place of employment when someone asked what effect 
his synthetic hip had had on his illustrious athletic career and his general 
well-being. Bo considered this question with a comprehending nod of his head 
and a sincere tone to his reply, but what he said was: "Well, I spent a lot of 
time setting off the metal detector at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a good thing, the Angels inviting the mighty Bo to camp, even if they 
are the only ones willing to invest a few bucks in him now. Nobody is kidding 
anybody that Jackson will guide this ballclub out of the American League 
wilderness, but the price is reasonably cheap, the risk is minimal and the 
player is a genuine American icon who is all of 31 and not yet ready to be a 
biker. He thinks there's still some life in the sculptured old body. And so 
does young Bill Bavasi, the new Angel general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to be able to tell you that Jim Thorpe was back," Bavasi says. "But 
we're just looking forward to a '94 version of Bo Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 As with other multifaceted athletes of past or present, Jackson is never sure 
from one season to the next where he can ply his trade. What greater lunacy 
could there be than, for example, this long-long-longshot possibility of Bo 
Jackson's job being taken over by Michael Jordan . . . on a baseball field. 
Professional sport has become a jigsaw puzzle, one in which Deion Sanders never 
knows when he will be wearing flannel or nylon or in which Herschel Walker 
might be seen one morning stiff-arming a tackler and another morning pushing a 
sled. 
</P>
<P>
 Football was the fall pastime of Bo Jackson once, but now he wants no part of 
it. None. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much do I miss it?" he asks. "I don't miss it, because I never think 
about it. When I'm finished with something, I'm finished with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a rule in my house. No one's allowed to watch any baseball, any 
football, any basketball. No ball, period. Now we can watch some NASCAR or 
maybe a little golf, but that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah? How come? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, let me ask you something," Jackson replies to an interviewer. "Would 
you want to go home and watch someone do interviews?" 
</P>
<P>
 The interviewer laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to be funny," Bo says. 
</P>
<P>
 What he means is, he needs to be doing something, not observing something. Bo 
Jackson is a doer. He has been keeping active in Arizona, working out, dropping 
10 pounds from his tummy and two inches from his waistline. Although he has 
always been a marvel of a physical specimen, real hip or fake, Jackson can go 
soft the same way anyone can without exercising at his usual pace. When asked 
what his training schedule consists of, he says: "It consists of working your 
buns off. Exercise, repetition and lots of sweatin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he might not be one of the usual Angels in the outfield, being 
prepared to play is Jackson's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to take someone's job," he says. "I'm a fourth outfielder. I 
will be in the outfield when one of the other outfielders aren't able or 
capable. I haven't come to the California Angels to try to be a quote-unquote 
savior. If there's a void, I'll try to fill it. But if the job belongs to 
somebody else, then I'll politely step aside and let them handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he can help. Maybe he can't. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi is curious himself. That's why he signed Jackson. That's why he says: 
"I'll tell you the only thing I know about Bo. If he sets his mind to do 
something, and if anybody bets against him, I would cover those bets."

CAROLINA DREAMING; GREAT THINGS ARE EXPECTED OF THE HORNETS, WHO FIND POTENTIAL 
CAN BE A BURDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A funny thing happened on the way to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 That was where the Hornets thought they were headed. They had admirers who 
said it was going to be this season, too -- including the New York Times, which 
predicted a Houston-Charlotte matchup. The Hornets now complain about media 
pressure, but the day the story ran, owner George Shinn was so happy, he 
brought the paper to practice to show everyone they had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson No. 1: It ain't that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Shinn's $84-million man, Larry Johnson, has injured his back and 
might wind up writing off the season. 
</P>
<P>
 His $25-million relative bargain, Alonzo 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning, has gone out because of knee, ankle and calf injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 They have all had to learn about living up to expectations. Time is still on 
their side, but it hasn't kicked in as fast as they had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "People saw this as an up-and-coming team, a team that could do some damage in 
the Eastern Conference, a team that played the Knicks as well as anyone, other 
than Chicago," said newly arrived veteran Eddie Johnson. "So the expectations 
weren't unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was, these guys didn't understand what those expectations were; 
and that when somebody projects you to be one of the top-echelon teams, that 
means you've got to exert extra energy because now teams expect you and they're 
going to come in and play harder. I think that's what happened to us early in 
the year against some teams. We expected just to roll the ball out and win, and 
those teams came out and played a heck of a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a struggle so far this year, but they're starting to understand 
that the better you become, the harder it is to win. People always think it's a 
breath of fresh air when you finish something. You finish high school and you 
hear all the stories about college and the partying and all that. But when you 
get to college, it's harder! And when you get out of college, you get into the 
real world, you think you can take a break and you find out it's extra hard. 
You've got to find a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's the same way with basketball. The better you are, the harder it is 
to keep achieving. And I think they're starting to understand that. It's not 
too late because it's early in the year." 
</P>
<P>
 There's an easy explanation of how the Hornets got so good so fast: luck. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the NBA's fifth-worst team in 1991, with seven of the 66 Ping-Pong 
balls when they drew the No. 1 slot in the draft lottery -- a 9-1 shot -- and 
got Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 They were eighth-worst in 1992, with four balls, when they came up No. 2 -- a 
16-1 shot -- and got Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, they had fallen over themselves like clumsy puppies. Shinn, a 
hyper-enthusiastic man who had worked his way up from janitor to millionaire, 
turned his years of being an Atlantic Coast Conference fan into injunctions to 
take the best Tar Heel, Blue Devil or Cavalier available. He bypassed his own 
front office to make the deal for Mike Gminski, who played at Duke. He urged 
the drafting of J.R. Reid of North Carolina. He yearned so for Ralph Sampson of 
Virginia that a Hornet official had to spend a week in Sacramento confirming 
that Sampson's knees were shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Having made better marketing decisions, Shinn had room for error. Charlotte 
fans, already crazy about college basketball, flocked to the state-of-the-art 
arena on Hive Drive. From Dec. 23, 1989, the night they beat the Bulls on a 
Kurt Rambis tip-in, the 23,698-seat arena, biggest in the NBA, has sold out, 
214 times through the end of January and counting. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 1990-91-92 drafts brought Kendall Gill, Johnson and Mourning, they 
had something to cheer for. The Hornets went up like a rocket, breathed 
rarefied air and became giddy. 
</P>
<P>
 They won their last five games last season and qualified for the playoffs for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 They ousted the Boston Celtics on Mourning's dramatic 20-footer in Game 4 and 
moved on to meet the Knicks. Anything but awed, the Hornets informed the Knicks 
they were their equals, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gill: "We have more talent than New York does. We just haven't put 
everything together like New York has to this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Muggsy Bogues: "You look at New York and you constantly wonder how they 
got 60 wins." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Knicks showed them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets had a 12-point lead in the first half in Game 1 at Madison Square 
Garden, but the Knicks outscored them, 31-15, in the fourth quarter and won. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot-tempered Hornet Coach Allan Bristow, resisting an invitation to compliment 
Pat Riley's superbly conditioned players, sputtered: "Wore down? Are you 
kidding me? He was playing our game! Ask them if they got worn down. They're 
the ones that aren't used to this pace."  
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets had a 13-point lead with 6:48 left in Game 2, but the Knicks shut 
them down again. Still unimpressed, Bristow sneered to reporters: "Their 
defense, I think it plays on your minds. We had the opportunities, we just 
didn't convert."  
</P>
<P>
 Sighed Doc Rivers: "That's Allan Bristow." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Charlotte, the Hornets won Game 3 in two overtimes. Johnson scored 31 
points and got so excited once, after making a shot, he just began jumping up 
and down on the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Knicks won Game 4 on 34-year-old Rolando Blackman's 20-foot shot with 
five seconds to play. They won Game 5 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Experience counts in postseason play, and the Hornets had just begun to get 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the Hornets traded Gill, who was threatening to become a free 
agent, but replaced him with Hersey Hawkins, less temperamental and a better 
shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinn then fired the shot heard 'round the league, signing Larry Johnson, who 
still had four years on his contract at $3 million a year, to an $84-million, 
10-year extension. General managers everywhere winced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was a sense of shock," Orlando's Pat Williams said. "I don't 
think anyone expected it. There was no warning. The question was, why then?" 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner David Stern asked Shinn if he realized he had just given one man 
more than twice the $32.5 million he paid for the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Hornets claim not to have heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The reaction) wasn't as great as you think it is," team President Spencer 
Stolpen said. "There's only one or two people who dared say it to my face, and 
when I explain it, every one of them seems to understand it. I think a lot of 
them are just jealous that they didn't have an owner and/or a player to put 
those two things together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were thinking that, one, we wanted to keep Larry here. We didn't want to 
go through the Gill situation. Two, with the collective bargaining agreement 
ending this year, we didn't want to play games with what the numbers were going 
to end up to be. Larry rolled the dice that he's not going to underprice 
himself over the next few years. We rolled the dice that he's going to be the 
player we think he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, I don't think any one of us regrets the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, actually, it's a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In a charity game in July, Johnson reached back for a tomahawk dunk and felt 
something pull in his back. It wasn't supposed to be serious, but when training 
camp started, Johnson's right leg was weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tried to go in training camp early and he couldn't, so we just gave him 
the four weeks off," Bristow said. "He hadn't been playing 100%, and then he 
re-injured it in the Detroit game right before Christmas. Whether this is 
related to the same injury they don't know, but it's certainly the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize, yeah, he can still occasionally get the big numbers, 
but he's not doing the explosive stuff that Larry did the last couple years. 
Yeah, he can battle his way into getting 29 points and 15 rebounds, but he's 
not ready to take Charles Barkley one on four and dunk over him. That's what he 
did his first couple years." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the Hornets had hoped that Johnson would return in December. Then in 
January. Now he is scheduled to be re-evaluated during the All-Star break this 
month amid speculation he might not be back before April. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I knew we could get Larry back at full strength in March," Bristow said, 
"I'd take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mourning had his own troubles. A knee injury cut short his training 
camp, after which he left the lineup because of a sprained ankle, then a 
bruised calf. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this season would be hard for them to beat, but the Hornets' best 
days do lie ahead. They have four veterans on the last year of their contracts. 
By renouncing them, they can duck under the salary cap and make a run at a free 
agent, Horace Grant, or, Shinn's dream, North Carolina native Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need some time," Stolpen said in the sunnier days when the Hornets 
thought Johnson would be back in a couple of weeks. No question another player, 
another big guy, would probably help. I think we're one piece away from not 
only a run, but a consistent long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge is to compete with ourselves. How do we keep getting better 
than we were? How do we stay there? I spend a lot of time trying to analyze 
what Boston did wrong, what the Lakers did wrong, what the Pistons did wrong. 
How do you stop that major fall after a long-term championship team? That's 
what I'm trying to figure out, and I don't have the answer yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is you probably have to trade someone who's still very productive 
to get you a chance to get somebody young. Boston probably could have traded 
Kevin McHale or Robert Parish four or five years ago and gotten talent to keep 
themselves going. And instead of trying to dump James Worthy in the last two 
years of his contract, if the Lakers had moved four years ago, they maybe could 
have gotten (some help) -- but I don't know. It's not easy to do. If it ever 
came that I had to move Larry, it'd be a tough decision." 
</P>
<P>
 But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Before the Hornets worry about the 
second dynasty, they will have to realize the first. It's fun to dream, and in 
Charlotte, it's still what they do best.

WHAT'S NEXT?; COWBOYS MADE MOVES THEY HAD TO MAKE TO WIN THIS SUPER BOWL, BUT 
TO WIN UNPRECEDENTED THREE IN A ROW, MORE MOVES ARE NECESSARY 
</P>

<P>
 The ending Sunday night was nothing short of glorious: men dressed in blue and 
silver walking across a field below cheering masses, taped fists pointed to the 
sky, eyes watering, flashbulbs popping. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith reminded everyone Monday that it began with a couch, a television 
set and an anxiety attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the perilousness of the Dallas Cowboys' seven-month journey, which 
culminated in their second consecutive NFL championship Sunday night. Nothing 
that looked so easy has ever been so hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was as difficult a year, in a good year, as I have ever been through," 
Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the masterpiece that was the Cowboys' season, their 30-13 victory over the 
Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVIII represented only the signature. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of the work was shaped throughout the fall and winter, by quick 
maneuvers and impulsive decisions that sometimes occurred far from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 This aggressiveness and ingenuity helped the Cowboys survive everything from 
football's most celebrated holdout to its most celebrated blooper. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't arrive at their place in history Sunday night at the Georgia Dome 
simply because they were pro football's best team. 
</P>
<P>
 By leaps and bounds, they are also its best organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody around here is in agreement that we do whatever it takes," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They lost Smith for the first two games of the season because of a holdout 
. . . but re-signed him one breath before disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Both games were unpleasant defeats, both watched by Smith on television at his 
home in Pensacola, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Cowboys fell to 0-2, Smith saw a televised shot of the hole that 
frustrated teammate Charles Haley had placed in a locker room wall with his 
helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 He then saw Johnson give an interview and noticed how red his face looked. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, he signed a $13.6-million contract that could have been 
considerably bigger if he had waited longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw what happened on TV, I knew then I had to get in there to relieve 
the tension," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if he had sold himself short, he quickly answered: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Five months later, he became only the fourth player to win both the NFL and 
Super Bowl MVP awards in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Johnson suddenly, angrily fired popular kicker Lin Elliott after two games 
and two missed field goals . . . but quickly hired veteran Eddie Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray is notoriously weak on kickoffs, but Johnson didn't care. He simply 
hired faster special teams players -- Elvis Patterson and Joe Fishback -- on 
Murray's flanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray kicked 28 field goals in 33 tries during the regular season and was six 
for six in the playoffs, including three Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cowboys lost a Thanksgiving game to the Miami Dolphins when Leon Lett 
touched a blocked field goal and gave the Dolphins another chance, which they 
converted for a victory that damaged Dallas' divisional title hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Johnson saw Lett weeping on the trainer's table afterward, he 
consoled him. Later,he said Lett would be a Cowboy as long as Johnson was the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Lett made perhaps the play of the game by stripping the ball from 
Thurman Thomas, leading to a 46-yard fumble return for a touchdown by teammate 
James Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I say some of the things I do," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman was on the sideline because of a hamstring 
injury . . . so Johnson signed Bernie Kosar two days after he was released by 
the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins needed Kosar more then the Cowboys, and wooed him first. 
</P>
<P>
 But when owner Jerry Jones threw $1 million at Kosar for half a season, 
Johnson promised Kosar he could play in his first game as a Cowboy and for as 
long as Aikman was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days after joining the team, Kosar led the Cowboys to touchdowns on his 
first two drives in a victory over the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, he threw the game-clinching touchdown pass in the NFC 
championship game against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People thought we overpaid for Bernie, but look what he did for us," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With a home-field advantage in the playoffs on the line against the New 
York Giants in the final game of the season, Smith separated his shoulder in 
the first half . . . but Johnson allowed him to play the rest of the game and 
in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith gained 78 yards after the injury -- 229 yards counting rushing and 
receiving -- in the most courageous performance by a player this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys won on Murray's field goal and were never threatened in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it comes down to the bottom line," Johnson said. "We can't be 
thinking about shoulders and backs and hamstrings. As a team, we have to look 
for that bottom line, and that is winning when you have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Of bottom lines, Monday's news conference was only 11 minutes old when 
somebody -- it was Smith -- first mentioned three-peat . 
</P>
<P>
 Can the Cowboys become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive 
Super Bowl championships? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to try to keep this team together," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys will have 19 unrestricted free agents, including starting 
offensive linemen Nate Newton, Mark Stepnoski, John Gesek and Kevin Gogan. 
Fullback Daryl Johnston is alsofree. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the advance payments made in contracts given to Smith and Aikman, 
there should be room under the salary cap to keep the team intact. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones can also expect that Michael Irvin, scheduled to make $1.17 million 
next year, will threaten to stay out if he does not get a new deal worth at 
least $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And even Smith said he would not rule out a renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows, maybe Jerry will come to me now," Smith said. "Maybe we'll see a 
side of Jerry that nobody knows." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson agrees. He said Monday that, instead of following the recent Cowboy 
tradition of outfoxing the league in the draft, his coaches were going to 
concentrate on free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 With no rules stopping them from signing as many top free agents as possible, 
look for Johnson to seek a pass rusher -- possibly Clyde Simmons -- and some 
offensive linemen to replace any he loses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not hesitate to bring someone in here to upgrade us," Johnson said. 
"We will not close the door on any top player." 
</P>
<P>
 He will also be looking for an offensive coordinator to replace Norv Turner, 
who is expected to become head coach of the Washington Redskins this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think we'll score a touchdown or two next year," Johnson said, already 
throwing in a dig even before Turner leaves the building. "Norv is a great 
coach . . . but we do have eight Pro Bowl players on our offense." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about Johnson staying with the Cowboys? He repeated that he was happy 
in Dallas, for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any thoughts right now about doing anything else," Johnson said. 
"But it's never 100% that I'll do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 12 hours after the hugs between Johnson and Jones, they are 
disagreeing again. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones wants to accept President Clinton's invitation to visit the White House. 
Johnson wants to flee to his boat off the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry wants to go. . . . I'll do what I have to do," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He can at least be pleased that the only thing a national TV audience saw more 
than Emmitt Smith last weekend was the commercial in which Johnson and several 
players drive past Jones on their way to Atlanta, leaving him choking on dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a fun commercial, and it was Jerry who had the idea that we not pick 
him up," Johnson said, smiling. "I guess he wanted to make it as realistic as 
possible."

DUKE IS LATEST NO. 1 IN AP POLL; UCLA FALLS TO NO. 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A familiar name was atop the Associated Press college basketball rankings 
Monday as Duke became the sixth school to hold the No. 1 spot this season. It 
was the fifth consecutive poll with a different team on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously No. 1 UCLA, the last undefeated Division I team, dropped to No. 4 
after falling to California on Sunday, 85-70. The Bears (12-4), ranked sixth in 
the preseason, returned to the rankings at No. 19 after a one-week absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke (15-1) reached No. 1 for the third season in a row, and the Blue Devils' 
first game with the top ranking will be Thursday night at No. 2 North Carolina. 
It will be the first 1-2 matchup since top-ranked Nevada Las Vegas defeated 
Arkansas, 112-105, on Feb. 10, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be a good Duke team, but not as good as the ones that 
made the Final Four part of their regular schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very surprised," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said Monday. "I think that 
going into the year we had a lot of questions about our group and midway 
through the year we still have a lot of questions. I've had opportunities to 
coach teams that have been No. 1 before and this team is very much a developing 
team. We think it is an honor to be voted No. 1 at any time because you may 
never be voted No. 1 again."

EX-CUB SMITH OKS ONE-YEAR DEAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 While he doesn't have the glamour or magnetism of Bo Jackson, the Angels 
grabbed another candidate for their left field job Monday when they reached 
agreement with free agent Dwight Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith will sign a one-year contract for about $700,000, according to sources, 
and be placed on the 40-man roster. The Angels are expected to make the 
announcement today. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 30, batted .300 for the Cubs last season with a career-high 11 homer 
runs. Smith, runner-up for the 1989 National League rookie of the year award, 
holds the Cubs' all-time record with 50 pinch-hits in his five-year career. BOB

JACKSON: JUST THE ANGELS' FOURTH OUTFIELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was designed to be a news conference, but the moment he walked through the 
door Monday afternoon, the Angels knew their entire image suddenly had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been years since they had this feeling, but for the first time since 
the Angels last had a Jackson on the field, they now have an identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie was the one responsible for delivering glamour and sex appeal to the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bo is bringing it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really never understood that magnetism he had," Angel General Manager Bill 
Bavasi said, "until today. It was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Edward Jackson, whom the world simply calls, "Bo," charmed, teased and 
mesmerized reporters and photographers for nearly an hour at Anaheim Stadium. 
It was the Angels' best-attended news conference since Reggie Jackson signed as 
a free agent in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 100 people, including 12 television crews. The Angels' entire 
front office was there, no one willing to miss the moment 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson warned the assemblage that he's not a franchise savior. He even called 
himself a fourth outfielder, who wasn't trying to cost anyone a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it didn't matter. This is a guy who transcended two sports before Deion 
Sanders ever entertained the notion. This is a guy who is playing with an 
artificial hip, knowing it could break at any time. This is charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who acknowledge that Jackson will be an instant gate attraction -- 
but claim it is not the sole reason they signed him -- believe this will be a 
cozy arrangement. Jackson will be paid $1 million if he makes the opening-day 
roster. If he's cut in spring training, they Angels are responsible for only 
$300,000. Jackson can earn $2.2 million if he plays in 130 games, receiving a 
$200,000 bonus for every 10 games he plays beginning with the 80th and ending 
with the 130th. 
</P>
<P>
 "My role is to play where I'm needed," Jackson said. "I'm just here to be part 
of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 While Jackson was talking as smoothly as a politician, he wasn't fooling 
anyone. He's not coming to California simply to be close to Hollywood. He wants 
to play, whether it will be as the Angels' starting left fielder or as their 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what he said," Bavasi said, "but I can't believe he goes back to 
Phoenix and works out just to be a fourth outfielder. No way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels already have a full-time DH in Chili Davis, who hit 27 homers and 
drove in 112 runs last season. They also have viable left fielders in Eduardo 
Perez and free agent Dwight Smith, who reached a tentative agreement Monday on 
a one-year contract, according to a knowledgeable source. 
</P>
<P>
 Any possible conflict could be resolved by trading Davis, who is guaranteed 
$2.4 million and could earn $3.05 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no sacred cows here," Bavasi said. "This gives us flexibility."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying we're signing the same Bo Jackson. I mean, we wouldn't even be 
having this conversation if he had stayed away from football."  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has spent his entire professional career thwarting those who doubted 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 They said he would never play major league baseball after winning the Heisman 
Trophy in 1985. He was playing for the Kansas City Royals eight months later. 
</P>
<P>
 They said it was impossible to play two professional sports. Jackson was 
playing for the Raiders and Royals in 1987, earning All-Star and Pro Bowl 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
 They said he was finished after undergoing hip replacement surgery in 1992. He 
hit a home run in his first at-bat of the 1993 season for the Chicago White 
Sox, hitting .232 with 16 homers and 45 RBIs in 85 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "People told me I'd never amount to anything growing up," Jackson said. "All I 
can say is, 'Look at me now, baby, look at me now.' " Bo Jackson's Statistics

CHAMINADE'S SAUNDERS COMMITS TO HAWAII 
</P>

<P>
 Franklin Saunders, a running back from Chaminade, who suffered a season-ending 
knee injury early in the season, has made an oral commitment to play at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders began the season as one of the top running backs in the Valley.On his 
first carry of the Eagles' fifth game, he suffered a torn anterior cruciate 
ligament in his right knee, ending his season. Saunders, who finished with 744 
yards in 108 carries, underwent surgery Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hawaii's) trainer was very impressed with how well it's come along," 
Saunders said. "I don't have a limp at all. When I'm wearing long pants, people 
can't even tell I've had surgery and some people who knew I had surgery 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders took a trip to Hawaii last weekend. He said he chose the Rainbows 
over Washington State and San Jose State because he believed he had the best 
chance to play right away and he was attracted to that school's pre-med 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course the location is beautiful," he said. "I can't really explain the 
feeling I got (during the visit), you just know it's there." JEFF FLETCHER

SYLMAR RUNNING BACK CRENSHAW OPTS TO PLAY FOR MICHIGAN STATE; RECRUITING: 
CHAMINADE'S SAUNDERS COMMITS TO HAWAII AND CANYON'S WILLIAMS SELECTS ST. 
MARY'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Running back Tyrone Crenshaw, Sylmar High's two-time City Section 4-A Division 
player of the year, has orally committed to play football for Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, who averaged 8.3 yards a carry in three seasons at Sylmar and led 
the Spartans to a 4-A championship title in 1992, said he will sign a letter of 
intent Wednesday, the first day of the early signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'll be a Spartan for life -- or at least another four or five 
years," Crenshaw joked. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-11, 180-pound tailback also took recruiting trips to California, 
Arizona State and Oklahoma and canceled a trip to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason I like the Big Ten better than the Pac-10," Crenshaw said. 
"There's a lot more tradition. They have a lot more money. They're more 
established." 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining a running back in college was Crenshaw's top priority. He was not 
willing to convert to defensive back, which many college coaches had desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being slowed by an ankle injury for the better part of his junior and 
senior seasons, Crenshaw was one of the country's top recruits, garnering 
several national and state accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 He led area City rushers for the second consecutive season with 1,785 yards 
and 23 touchdowns. As a junior, Crenshaw rushed for 1,875 yards and 22 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, Michigan State's sole running back recruit, has not yet earned a 
minimum requirement score of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.  
</P>
<P>
 He took the test last month and is awaiting the results. The Michigan State 
scholarship offer is contingent on Crenshaw's scoring 700 or better, but 
Crenshaw isn't worried. He is already gearing up for the brisk winter chill of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I got to get used to is the cold weather," Crenshaw said. "I 
won't be stepping out a lot, I'll tell you that -- I'll be in my dorm room or 
in class, that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw was impressed with the campus, athletic facilities and academic 
support staff at Michigan State, but is most inspired by the thought of playing 
against one of his idols, Michigan running back Tyrone Wheatley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to see him play (in person)," Crenshaw said. "I love the 
way he runs. I guess I'm going to join my idol in the Big 10." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Canyon High running back Ed Williams has made an oral commitment to St. Mary's 
after considering Trinity College of Chicago and the Army Academy.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite nagging injuries through most of his senior season, Williams rushed 
for 1,081 yards and averaged 7.35 yards per carry. He also caught 20 passes for 
251 yards and scored 20 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Gaels) haven't promised me anything, but they say I have a chance to 
play next year," Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 "St. Mary's was pretty much my first choice, and it was a matter of money. 
They're giving me almost a full scholarship, and they only give partials 
there." Times' Top 20 Basketball Polls

SINGLES CHECK POTENTIAL MATE TO AVOID BECOMING A PAWN; RELATIONSHIPS: MORE O.C. 
WOMEN, AND SOME MEN, ARE INVESTIGATING BACKGROUNDS TO MAKE SURE A MATCH IS NOT 
JUST A GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In 1992, Anna -- a divorced Orange County management consultant -- started a 
serious relationship with a high-powered executive she'd met five years earlier 
at the Balboa Bay Club. Nine months later, she found out he was married to a 
Los Angeles woman. 
</P>
<P>
 He presented himself as a successful, single businessman who traveled a lot, 
recalls Anna, who last year told her story on CNN's "Sonya Live" talk show. "He 
stayed at my home, took me on trips, and his secretaries knew me. I was furious 
when I finally found out he was married." 
</P>
<P>
 It's love-is-blind experiences like this that are prompting more and more 
women -- and some men -- to check out their dates, often before investing any 
time or emotion in a potential romance. They may hire professional 
investigators or conduct do-it-yourself gumshoe projects using sleuthing guides 
such as books or videotapes to learn how to legally access a myriad of public 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowledge is power," says Anna over a pancake breakfast at a Newport Beach 
eatery. "If I'd known then the information resources available to me as a 
financially struggling single parent, I could have saved myself a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna, who asked that her real name not be used in this story, says she'd 
suspected her paramour might be married but every time she voiced those fears, 
both he and her friends told her she was "just paranoid." Still, about three 
months into the relationship, she asked her attorney to run a check on the 
man's property to see if there was a wife listed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That cost me about $22, and it came up clean," recalls Anna. "So I just 
figured that yes, I was being paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
 The ax fell, Anna says, when one weekend she was unable to reach the man on 
the cellular phone that he carried in his briefcase. She pulled out the 
property check report to get an address and dialed information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just did it out of frustration," she says. "I never dreamed I would get a 
listing, but the operator gave me one for a husband and wife." 
</P>
<P>
 She called the wife, introduced herself and said: "(Not knowing he was 
married), I have been sleeping with your husband for the past nine months." 
After a long conversation with the wife (learning among other things that the 
woman's husband had even brought her lemons from Anna's back yard), Anna called 
the man and confronted him. He hung up on her. They never spoke again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt betrayed, but at least I knew my intuitions had been correct," says 
Anna, adding that in the future she will hire professionals to investigate any 
man she's serious about. She sighs. "I'm an intelligent person," she says. "I 
own my own company. I did my homework the best I knew how. It can happen to 
anyone." 
</P>

 Pat Rutherford sits in his cramped San Clemente office, the wall behind him 
slathered with photographs of people he's found. Much of his business, called 
Worldwide Tracers, is tracking the missing, but an increasing number of cases 
-- about 20 a month -- involve surreptitious background checks for love. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very common now to check out your man," says Rutherford, 66. 
"Unfortunately, too many people think about it too late. They're in so far and 
then it's 'Oh, my God!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford says 90% of his clients are women, because it's usually women who 
are conned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lead with their hearts and want to believe even though they sense 
something isn't quite right," he says. "Ladies have a sixth sense about these 
things, but some of the mistakes they make make you want to cry. I do a lot of 
counseling to hurting women." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford's first such case about four years ago involved a woman who was 
leery of her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "She called him Mr. Wonderful," recalls Rutherford. "He swept her off her feet 
and did everything for her except for one thing: He wouldn't give her his 
address or phone number. I checked him out and guess what? Mr. Wonderful had a 
family. Mr. Wonderful was not so wonderful at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford, who employs seven investigators -- most of whom are female -- says 
any detective will say he or she can do date checks, but not all do a good job, 
and many charge a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Rutherford: "Most of our clients are not rich people. So if you say '$50 
an hour and I need up front six or seven hours pay,' God, a person can spend a 
fortune."  
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide Tracers charges a flat date check fee of $200. That price includes 
computer checks for criminal convictions; property ownership; bankruptcies; 
county, state and federal tax liens; small civil claims; judgments; notices of 
defaults; drunk driving convictions; date of birth and name verification; a 
listing of family members at same address; marriages and divorces, and 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic check also includes a "sting," whereby investigators pretend to be 
someone else to gain information from neighbors, employers, ex-wives or the 
investigated parties themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone can run a computer check," Rutherford says. "But you gotta be in the 
right databanks and even so, that often that doesn't tell you enough. That's 
where the sting comes in. You'd be amazed at what we can find out through 
stings." 
</P>
<P>
 The stings are also fun for the investigator, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're licensed to lie," says Rutherford with a laugh, adding that the only 
people investigators can't claim to be are police, state or government 
officials. "That's the fun part. It's like being a 7-year-old playing games." 
</P>
<P>
 After the basic check, some clients -- about 20% -- elect to have the parties 
followed, but Rutherford, who charges $35 per hour for surveillance, says he 
tries to discourage that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say 'look, you already found out he's a jerk, why put any more money into 
it?' Like in (Alcoholics Anonymous), you just gotta get rid of what's killing 
you." 
</P>

 Tom Lawson stands by the window in his Newport Beach office. The founder of 
Apscreen, a consumer reporting agency that since 1980 has performed hundreds of 
thousands of background checks for businesses, says his firm about four years 
ago officially expanded into the personal realm and now does about 300 
"sweetheart checks" annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a cloak-and-dagger private investigations firm," Lawson says. "We 
don't chase cheating (men), and we don't carry guns. We're a research company 
whose ethics come from a different plane." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson says Southern California is the "fraud capital of the world," and 
sweetheart checks are the "hot new thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more people are going into this, but they're less and less 
qualified," Lawson says. "With a computer, you can access what appears to be a 
world of information, but database information is at best a spot-check tool, 
not a definitive search. People can be sold a bill of goods." 
</P>
<P>
 Individual sweetheart services, such as a criminal or a property ownership 
check, cost from $12.50 to $50. But most people take the package deal for $300, 
which includes criminal and litigation histories (including divorces); asset 
discoveries; liabilities such as tax liens, judgments, evictions, defaults and 
foreclosures; business involvements and financial encumbrances; license, 
address, Social Security number and name verification; a media check, and 
marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson says the best sweetheart check is done with the consent of the person 
being investigated. (About 20% of his clients do obtain written consent.) He 
cautions against unscrupulous detectives whom he says sometimes do illegal 
things that violate a person's legal privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, you need to go into a relationship with your eyes open and 
with enough self-confidence to tell the person you want to know more about 
them," Lawson says. "If they do have something to hide, they could respond 
adversely, which tells you something right there. Then again they could respond 
without concern, not thinking you can find what they're hiding." 
</P>
<P>
 Without consent, Lawson says, certain records -- such as insurance files and 
credit reports -- cannot be legally obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beware of people who tell you you can get anything without consent," Lawson 
says. "The industry is plagued by that." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Lawson's clients is Sharon, 30, who also asked that her real name not 
be used. Speaking by telephone, the stock analyst says she last year attended a 
white-collar crime seminar that included a discussion of all the ways anyone 
can gain information from public records. Her interest was particularly piqued, 
she says, because for six months she'd been dating a man she wasn't sure had 
been truthful with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He professed to be doing so well in the business world, but he never took me 
to his office or introduced me to his employees," she recalls. "I thought that 
was awfully odd. And things just didn't make sense in general: I just couldn't 
get all the pieces of the puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
 Her fear, Sharon says, was that her man may have been doing something illegal. 
She also worried that he might not be who he said he was or that perhaps there 
was a history of abuse. Not wanting to take the time to stand in line to obtain 
public records herself and not wanting to sign her name on any requests to 
obtain those records, she hired Apscreen to investigate for her. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: The man had told her some minor business fabrications, but there 
was no adverse information in his divorce, property or criminal files. Still, 
six months later she broke up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "These checks can give you a feel for if there's something drastically wrong, 
but they're not a catch-all insight into personality traits," she says. "I 
still felt like there was something really wrong, and in the end you still have 
to go with your gut." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, her gut was correct. After she left him, the man threatened her. 
She took him to court and won a restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next time some woman checks him out," Sharon says, "there will be 
something there to find."

 For those who have the time and energy to play Sam Spade, there's a videotape 
called "Do You Know Who You're Dating?" Distributed by International Film & 
Video in Costa Mesa, the 30-minute film features Chicago-area private 
investigator Jeff Hartman, who details tricks of the trade used by the pros. 
Says Hartman: "A lover's lies can cost you your life savings -- or your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are just some of the many ways Hartman and other professional snoops say 
you can find out if your romantic interest is married, broke, a criminal or a 
cad: 
</P>
<P>
 * Go to courthouses to check lawsuits, trials, bankruptcies and divorce files 
("divorce files are a gold mine," Hartman says). 
</P>
<P>
 * Check for marriage licenses at county clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check out birth certificates, liens and judgments at the county recorder's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Obtain proof of professional licenses from local or state licensing 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best yet, Hartman says, check your target's garbage for things such as 
prescription bottles, bank statements, receipts, letters, credit card and phone 
bills, smut magazines, doodlings, liquor bottles and lipstick on napkins. Says 
Hartman: "Garbage is an investigator's best friend." 
</P>
<P>
 To order the tape, which costs $14.95, call (800) 366-5902. LESLIE KNOWLTON

CREANS PUT ON THEIR GAME FACE FOR A SUPER BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For sports fans, watching the Super Bowl at the Village Crean on Sunday was 
the next best thing to being there. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Donna Crean opened their Tara-inspired mansion in Santa Ana Heights 
to about 200 guests for a lavish Super Bowl party that even featured a live 
halftime performance by the Newport Harbor High School Sailor Band. Guests paid 
$100 each to attend the party and silent auction, netting about $25,000 for the 
Juvenile Connection Program, part of the Orange-based Coalition for Children, 
Adolescents and Parents (C-CAP). 
</P>
<P>
 Armchair Quarterbacks 
</P>
<P>
 The Village Crean was equipped with everything but a football field for the 
big game. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure everyone had a good view of the showdown between the Dallas 
Cowboys and Buffalo Bills, the Creans set up a dozen big-screen televisions 
throughout the premises. A mini-theater equipped with several dozen easy chairs 
and a massive TV screen was reserved for serious football fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "What better place to watch the Super Bowl?" asked Lynne Tsuda, event 
co-chairwoman and soon-to-be-disappointed Buffalo Bills fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vendors" roamed the mansion passing out bags of popcorn and hot pretzels. 
Guests lined up in the back yard for burgers, hot dogs and other standard 
stadium fare. Throughout the day they visited a dessert table decorated like a 
football field and piled high with cookies and football-shaped brownies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the celebrities attending was the Creans' longtime friend Sandra Gould, 
who played nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz on the '60s TV series "Bewitched." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever I go, people recognize me," Gould said. "I'm dubbed in Japanese, and 
when I was in Japan shooting a commercial they all came up to me and started 
talking in Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, a Studio City resident, sported sunglasses with one lens missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake broke six pairs of my glasses," she said. "We lost a lot. I'm 
going to need another series." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping Families at Risk 
</P>
<P>
 For the Creans, throwing a Super Bowl party for their friends is an annual 
tradition, but four years ago they decided to turn it into a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "C-CAP needed a fund-raiser, and my husband had been saying for several years 
that he didn't understand why some charity didn't snap up the Super Bowl 
party," said event chairwoman Donna Crean, who hosts numerous charity events at 
her home each year. "Now we invite our friends and ask them to pay."  
</P>
<P>
 The coalition offers educational programs to help prevent unintended 
adolescent pregnancy in Orange County. Proceeds from the party were earmarked 
for C-CAP's Juvenile Connection Program, which provides an assessment and 
referral service to families in crisis. The program's goal is to keep children 
from engaging in "at-risk behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be as simple as taking a child to one of our dermatologists for 
tattoo removal to get him away from the gang influence or as severe as 
counseling a teen who is suicidal," says Rowene Medina, board president of 
C-CAP. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition can refer clients to more than 250 providers, including 
dentists, doctors and counselors, who offer services to the needy families for 
free or for reduced fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea of C-CAP is you can't just treat the child, you have to treat 
the whole family," Medina said. "We try to take care of the problem before the 
child ends up in juvenile detention." 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests were: Cynthia Scheinberg, executive director of C-CAP; Lee and 
Kathleen Goldberg, vice president of C-CAP; Michael Schumacher, C-CAP board 
member and Orange County Probation chief; actor Richard Moll, formerly of 
"Night Court," and his wife, Susan; Buzz and Lois Aldrin; Andy Crean; Don and 
Patricia Boortz; Yen Ngoc Do; Hiangkie Han; Michael and Grace Gatti; Joe and 
Linda Martin, and Jay and Maryjane Palchikoff. KATHRYN BOLD

O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; NEWPORT HARBOR: THE BOOM YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Kevin Consey arrived in September of 1983 to begin his term as director 
of Newport Harbor, museum supporters were hungry for strong leadership, a 
quality they didn't perceive in former director Kathleen Gallander. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tender age of 31, Consey had already been a museum director for six 
years, first at the Emily Lowe Gallery at Hofstra University in New York, his 
alma mater, and subsequently at the San Antonio Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling his decision to come to Newport Harbor, Consey once said it was the 
museum's potential that attracted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing played a role, too. In the late '70s and early '80s, the museum was 
wrestling with the issue of whether it was a volunteer or professional 
organization, Consey said. But by the time he arrived, the issue had been 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trustees were accepting the fact that they had to invest more confidence 
in the director and the professional staff because they couldn't stand to lose 
a director very quickly again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A big bear of a man with a stern profile -- you could easily imagine him a 
Renaissance courtly portrait -- Consey cultivated a stiff, even pompous manner 
in public, perhaps to mask his comparative youth. Discussing his relationship 
to museum staff, he would invoke the phrase "dispassionate distance." 
</P>
<P>
 But in private, he was a feisty conversationalist with a dark sense of humor 
-- he once lent this writer a tongue-in-cheek book picturing "road kills" -- 
and a warm heart. Hours after a memorial service for Betty Winkler, one of the 
museum's founders, he was still visibly shaken as he presided over an 
exhibition opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important to the museum, however, was his belief that a capable staff 
performs best without directorial interference. 
</P>
<P>
 When Consey arrived, Schimmel had been chief curator for two years, Ellen 
Breitman was in charge of education, and Richard Tellinghuisen headed museum 
operations. In short order, Consey assembled the remainder of an unusually 
able, committed and congenial staff that numbered more than three dozen in the 
mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good period for both of us," Schimmel -- who is now chief curator at 
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles -- recalled recently. "While he 
was focused on building a new institution, I was charged with . . . bringing 
the level of Newport's programming up to what would be suitable for a new 
world-class facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin saw what I had initiated with 'Action/Precision' (the first of three 
major exhibitions investigating aspects of Abstract Expressionism) before his 
arrival -- it was completed under him -- as being an important direction from a 
scholarly standpoint. He pushed for that kind of program -- looking at the 
history of American art -- and he continued to embrace the longstanding 
tradition of the institution's involvement in California art." 
</P>
<P>
 During Consey's first year, the museum's chronic financial problems were his 
biggest headache. When he arrived, the deficit was about $59,000, almost 10% of 
the annual operating budget of $600,000. A year later, the deficit was history 
and the budget had shot past $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consey achieved this coup with an aggressive pursuit of the business 
community, despite heavy competition from the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center building campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically used the strategy that we had a proven product, a history, and 
the Performing Arts Center had none," Consey said. "If you're going to fund a 
center based on promise, you should be willing to fund an art museum based on a 
clear record of service and performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Major gifts to the museum during Consey's tenure included a $300,000 National 
Endowment Challenge Grant, $250,000 from the Harry and Grace Steele Foundation, 
and a 10-year, $1-million exhibition grant from the Irvine Co. -- a windfall 
that, in retrospect, may have marked the beginning of a costly form of 
indentured servitude. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Riding high on his financial success during a period of major economic growth 
in Orange County, Consey immediately began planning to expand the museum, 
housed in a 23,000-square-foot building in Fashion Island that no longer seemed 
adequate to show off the permanent collection as well as traveling exhibitions. 
In 1987, Consey commissioned a feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the green light, the museum's building committee set about identifying a 
short list of internationally known architects, including Mexico's esteemed 
Ricardo Legoretta and Italy's Renzo Piano, who designed the Menil Collection 
museum in Houston and the Pompideau Centre in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board of trustees, which I had always heard was so difficult and 
controlling in terms of their own agenda," Consey says, "(was) for the vast 
time I was there extremely supportive and willing to make changes to bring 
greater recognition to the institution." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Consey was not to get his building. The museum board fired Piano in July, 
1990 -- eight months after Consey resigned to become director of the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Chicago, where he remains today. By early 1992, the economy 
had hit the skids and the whole project was axed. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Consey remains highly circumspect about his relationship with Irvine 
Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren, and though some deny it, persistent rumblings 
indicate that the developer's wishes were a key factor in plans for the 
10.5-acre parcel he donated at south Pacific Coast Highway and MacArthur 
Boulevard. (The $15-million building -- soon re-budgeted at $20 million -- also 
involved raising a $20-million endowment.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bren, a museum board member famous for his unwillingness to make public 
statements, never commented publicly on the design. Yet, sources say, when 
Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Thomas H. Nielsen was appointed board president in 
June, 1989, the balance of power in the museum "family" can be said to have 
shifted decisively toward the development company executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Piano's earliest schematic designs featured a wave-like series of roofs on six 
long structures ("fingers") linked by a glass "street." By August, 1989, when 
the 75,000-square-foot plan was unveiled to the public, the fingers were stuck 
together compactly and the wave roofs were replaced by a single, barrel-vaulted 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Piano later told a reporter, Bren was "quite persistent" that the finger 
design was too open and too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous other difficulties and disagreements -- to be discussed later 
in this series -- the museum fired Piano. By then, Consey had been in Chicago 
for the better part of a year. He bridles when asked about the belief -- held 
by some museum supporters -- that the plan lacked sufficient board enthusiasm 
during his directorship. 
</P>
<P>
 That notion is, he says, "a remarkable bit of revisionist history. . . . 
Hiring Mr. Piano, the conceptual plan, design and development -- every aspect 
was approved by the board for the almost three years I was involved. For 
someone (after I left) to decide it's too expensive (is like saying), 'We 
didn't know what we were doing for three years; we were hoodwinked by a 
silver-tongued devil.' "

FOLLOW-UP; HIV-POSITIVE ACTOR GETS CASTING CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lee Mathis has just shaved his head, a step he had been contemplating for a 
long time but lacked the courage to take. Advertising himself as an 
HIV-positive actor who needed work to qualify for union health coverage 
bolstered his resolve not to pull punches -- as did the outpouring of concern 
in its wake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was stopped in grocery stores, at the gym, the dentist, by friends and 
strangers alike -- people wishing me luck, saying, 'Way to go,' " says Mathis, 
whose plight was profiled in a recent Los Angeles Times article. "After the 
story, I was asked to appear on a couple of local TV news shows. Two national 
gay magazines wrote me up. The success of my campaign made me braver, 
determined not to put anything off." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news, the 41-year-old actor reports, is that he exceeded the amount 
necessary for Screen Actors Guild health insurance -- by $44.36. And the bad 
news? There was a three-month waiting period before the coverage kicked in -- a 
risky situation for anyone, let alone someone whose immune system is in 
disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis, a dancer-turned-actor who bartends part time, enlisted the help of the 
Actors' Fund of America -- an organization created to assist performers in 
crisis. After hearing his case, the group agreed to pay the $690 needed to 
cover him until April. Pride prevented him from accepting help from John Sousa, 
a Long Beach-based actor who had contacted SAG the day the newspaper story ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Sousa, who runs a window covering concern to make ends meet, had offered to 
pay the union $2,400 -- the difference between Mathis' earnings and the amount 
needed to qualify for health insurance. Informed that SAG income is the sole 
criteria for coverage, Sousa volunteered to reimburse any production company 
using Mathis' services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I had a gall bladder/appendix operation which left me $32,000 in 
the hole," says Sousa, 41, "and I know how hard it is to get work as an actor. 
Though I'm not gay, I have tremendous compassion for people in Mathis' 
position. If you have cancer, everyone's there for you. If you have AIDS -- or 
even announce that you're HIV-positive -- you're treated like a leper. This 
isn't a gay issue but a human one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pierre David, producer of "Open Fire," an action feature on which Mathis had 
worked in October, evidently thought so. After reading about Mathis, he placed 
a call to the actor asking if he was available for a night of "pickups" 
(fine-tuning a movie for editing purposes). Four hundred and fifty-five dollars 
from that gig, plus an extra day's pay when a job on TV's "Lois & Clark" was 
abruptly postponed nudged the actor toward his goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the nearly $2,000 from "Murder in the First" -- a Warner Bros. feature 
cast by Mary Jo Slater -- however, that pushed Mathis over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mary Jo had lined me up for a day's work but managed to extend the job to a 
week," says Mathis. "The thought of total strangers reaching out to me leaves 
me totally overwhelmed. Mary Jo is truly my guardian angel." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis got a running start toward qualifying for his 1994 insurance when 
casting director Tracy Lilienfield, who had been trading calls with the actor 
since the newspaper story appeared, hired him to play a paramedic on HBO's 
"Dream On." Slater also cast him as a fighter pilot for an episode of "Babylon 
5," a syndicated sci-fi series that premiered last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ("Babylon") part requires me to wear a helmet, so you don't see my head," 
says Mathis, who was hired a half hour after he read for the role. "That's 
probably a good thing since I've decided to grow my hair back. My hair is now 
at the 'baby bird' stage and, despite my newfound abandon, I feel more than a 
little silly." 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS-related death of a producer friend last weekend, however, put things 
in perspective. "You can never relax and take a deep breath," says Mathis. 
"Just like with the earthquake, the tremors keep coming."

SOAP ACTRESS WON'T QUIT HER DAY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many daytime drama actors dream of working on a prime-time series and leaving 
the soap-opera world behind. Not Victoria Rowell. She landed a job with Dick 
Van Dyke in CBS' Friday night mystery "Diagnosis Murder" but kept her job in 
the network sudser "The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy at 'Young and the Restless,' " she said emphatically during a 
recent interview at a Westside restaurant. "I don't see the soap as a vehicle 
or a step into stardom or features. To me, it's all one process. Work is work." 
</P>
<P>
 And work she does. Besides the daytime and nighttime series, Rowell dabbles in 
feature films, fulfills duties as Oil of Olay spokesperson, promotes her Rowell 
Foster Children's Scholarship Fund, keeps up her classical ballet work and is a 
single mother to 4-year-old Maya.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like my whole life was a preparation for this (kind of schedule)," 
she said. "My foster mother was an amazing woman. She was a self-sufficient 
widow who had already raised 10 of her own children. When she had the three of 
us, she was a senior citizen. She also ran a 60-acre farm." Rowell tries to 
emulate that energy for accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really say there is a recipe for how I get things done, but I have a 
couple of calendars, my Filofax is always close at hand and I have wonderful 
people helping me," Rowell said.  
</P>
<P>
 On the acting end, producers from each show coordinate her schedule to make 
sure there aren't any overlaps. On the personal side, she shares a personal 
assistant with actress Lee Purcell and has part-time help at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got a great disposition," observes Nancy Bradley Wiard, coordinating 
producer for "The Young and the Restless." "It's phenomenal that she can keep 
her characters straight while maintaining a wonderful sense of humor, be a good 
mother to Maya and have a regular life." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Steinberg, supervising producer of "Diagnosis Murder," agrees. "It's 
amazing how she finishes up on 'Y&R' and gets in her car and drives herself to 
'Diagnosis Murder' and can rush through makeup and be Amanda," he said. "I 
think she's just enjoying it so much and wants to do it so much that she just 
does it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," Rowell says, noting that she's always done other projects while 
working on the soap ("Distinguished Gentleman," HBO's "Full Eclipse" and many 
television guest-starring roles) and hopes to continue to do so. She also seems 
to be good at it: Rowell recently was named best daytime actress at the NAACP 
Image Awards, and on Friday she'll find out whether she's won in the best 
scene-stealer category on the "Soap Opera Digest Awards" on NBC.  
</P>
<P>
 Rowell began her entertainment career as a classical ballet dancer at age 8. 
Later, she taught ballet and worked as a model. While pregnant with Maya, she 
worked as a secretary, but was eager to start an acting career. In 1990, she 
landed the role of Dru on "The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
 When she started playing the illiterate thief, a homeless victim, there was 
concern among some black viewers that she was playing a negative stereotype.

 "I could understand that," she said. "But I also knew that there was going to 
be a metamorphosis (that would) turn this character around. I mean, we were 
able to incorporate my own classical ballet background into the story line!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Y&R's" strong black story line is a subject near and dear to Rowell, because 
she was taken from her first foster family at the age of 2 1/2 because they 
were white and she was half white. It's a fault in the foster-care system that 
Rowell would like to change. But it only confirms her commitment to teach her 
daughter about all of her heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rowell gently asks her platinum-blond haired, blue-eyed daughter what 
color she is, Maya answers proudly, "Black and white."

LETTING THREE-DOM RING; MUSIC: THE ARTISTS IN THE PIANO TRIO 
KALICHSTEIN-LAREDO-ROBINSON ALSO ENJOY SOLO CAREERS. THEY'LL BE AT THE IRVINE 
BARCLAY TONIGHT.

 Can't you just hear it? "Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson. May I help you?"  
</P>
<P>
 But Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson isn't a law firm. It's a piano trio, 
appearing, in fact, tonight at the Irvine Barclay Theatre in a concert 
sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society and Laguna Chamber Music 
Society. The program includes trios by Haydn (No. 18 in A), Mendelssohn (No. 1 
in D Minor) and Schubert (No. 2 in E-flat). 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a huge name," admitted pianist Joseph Kalichstein, reached by phone at 
his home in Maplewood, N.J. "The piano-trio format, unlike the string quartet, 
is really three individual voices. . . . We certainly did not invent the 
tradition of using three names. Actually, the Beaux Arts Trio went against 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Were there a Guinness record for longest piano trio name, 
Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson would win handily today. Historically, though, 
they'd play second (or even third) fiddle to such ensembles from the past as 
Heifetz-Piatigorsky-Rubinstein and Fischer-Schneiderhan-Mainardi. Yet 
background materials show little compassion for writers, blaring, DO NOT 
ABBREVIATE TO "KLR."  
</P>
<P>
 With a chuckle, Kalichstein cited a trio at the other end of the spectrum: "I 
remember when Emanuel Ax started playing in his trio (with violinist Young-Uck 
Kim and cellist Yo-Yo Ma), he pointed out that the Ax-Kim-Ma Trio had a shorter 
name than he did alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalichstein was born in Israel, violinist Jaime Laredo in Bolivia, and cellist 
Sharon Robinson in Houston. Kalichstein began playing chamber music with Laredo 
and Robinson, who are husband and wife, 18 years ago. The ensemble made its 
official debut at the White House at the inauguration of President Carter. The 
ensemble was formed after hastily mounted performances of Dvorak's piano 
quintet and piano quartet: Kalichstein, who had played the quintet but never 
seen the quartet, was a last-minute replacement at Laredo's behest; the two had 
played together once before. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, we all remarked how easy the performance was," Kalichstein 
recalled. "We seemed to phrase together, breathe together, sing together. 
Sharon and Jaime came to me and said, 'Maybe we should play together.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time with chamber concerts you're thrown together like that, you 
always wish you had two more rehearsals to scream at each other. We basically 
wanted to play concerts that were properly rehearsed." 
</P>
<P>
 All three musicians enjoy successful solo careers both on the concert stage 
and in the recording studio. Together they've made half a dozen recordings, 
including a recently released Vox Box that includes the three Brahms Piano 
Trios, both Mendelssohn trios and Dvorak's "Dumky" Trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalichstein addressed the pros and cons of playing in a full-time chamber 
ensemble, such as the Beaux Arts Trio, versus juggling solo and chamber 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say, I don't find any cons in our case," he said. "We are lucky enough 
to do both. If we played 100 concerts a year, maybe it would get on our nerves. 
Maybe not. As it is, we only do 35 concerts a year, and without sounding coy, 
we actually enjoy seeing each other each time. There's always a sense of 
rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only yesterday we came back to a piece we hadn't played for a long time, and 
all of a sudden it was in a faster tempo. We all sat up and took notice and 
delighted in the fact that it had continued to live when we were away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Each year the trio tours Europe. Next season they've scheduled more than the 
usual number of concerts, almost 50; Japanese and Australian tours alone 
account for 30 concerts. So who enjoys greater notoriety these days, 
Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson the trio, or Kalichstein, Laredo, Robinson the 
individuals?  
</P>
<P>
 "It could very well be the trio," he said. "I certainly cannot complain if 
it's one or the other. I'm known as a solo pianist, so I don't have an identity 
crisis. I'd played for a good 15 years professionally before we formed this 
trio, so many conductors, orchestras and audiences know me as such. There are 
also new audiences that know me only in a trio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people know me as someone with two different hats. I want to have that 
balance. In fact, that is my ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio plays music by Haydn, Mendelssohn and 
Schubert tonight at 8 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, UC 
Irvine. Sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society and the Laguna 
Beach Chamber Music Society. $12.50-$25. (714) 854-4646.

GLAAD HONORS 'PHILADELPHIA,' 'AND THE BAND PLAYED ON'; AWARDS: THE GAY AND 
LESBIAN ALLIANCE AGAINST DEFAMATION ALSO RECOGNIZES NBC'S 'SEINFELD' FOR ITS 
'CONTINUED INCLUSION OF GAY AND LESBIAN CHARACTERS.' 
</P>

<P>
 Hollywood's inconsistent track record in portraying gay and lesbian characters 
on the big screen is reflected in the 1993 Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation media awards announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't any (feature film) award given for 1992," said GLAAD's Los 
Angeles executive director Lee Werbel, "because there were no positive feature 
films." 
</P>
<P>
 But this year the honor goes to "Philadelphia," director Jonathan Demme's film 
about a gay attorney with AIDS who is fired from his job. The TriStar Pictures 
release is the first major American feature film to deal directly with the 
10-year-old AIDS epidemic. GLAAD said the film "brings a message of compassion 
and understanding about gay men and AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 The TV sitcom "Seinfeld," HBO's made for television film "And the Band Played 
On," Tony Kushner's stage drama "Angels in America" and recording artist 
Melissa Etheridge also will take home awards from the March 19 banquet in Los 
Angeles underwritten by the David Geffen Foundation. The awards are voted by 
the membership of GLAAD's national affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's "Seinfeld" is cited for its "continued inclusion of gay and lesbian 
characters." HBO's production of author Randy Shilts' "And the Band Played On" 
was credited for chronicling the first decade of AIDS, and Etheridge was 
honored for acknowledging she is lesbian and, in doing so, helping to 
"eliminate stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of sheer "visibility," as the category is labeled, GLAAD's winner is 
playwright Harvey Fierstein, for his overall contributions to increasing the 
visibility of gays and lesbians in the media.  
</P>
<P>
 Independent film winners: Samuel Goldwyn Co.'s release of "The Wedding 
Banquet" and the New York-based Women Make Movies release of "Forbidden Love: 
The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Other TV winners: "Sisters" for an ongoing lesbian character; "Law and Order" 
for an episode dealing with homophobia in the field of law enforcement; and the 
CBS afterschool special "Other Mothers."  
</P>
<P>
 Other winners: community service, Highways Performance Space; advertising, 
Kenneth Cole; TV journalism, Maria Shriver's report on "Gays in the '90s"; 
magazine journalism, Farai Chideya for a Spin magazine article on homophobia in 
the recording business; Deb Price of the Detroit News, the first nationally 
syndicated openly lesbian columnist; and a special award honoring MTV.

L.A. COLLECTIONS ON DISPLAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the smaller surprises in the Roy Lichtenstein retrospective at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art is the number of works -- including some of the best 
-- that come from Los Angeles collections. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15% of the show, or 14 of 91 paintings and sculptures, has been 
drawn from local holdings: Betty Asher, Eli and Edythe Broad, Douglas S. 
Cramer, David Geffen, Steve Martin, the estate of Marcia Weisman and MOCA's own 
Panza Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with two Lichtensteins from the Panza Collection not on view, and 
counting the great 1963 "Cold Shoulder" that is a promised gift to the County 
Museum of Art from Robert Halff of Beverly Hills, an estimable array of the 
artist's work is owned locally. 
</P>
<P>
 With 12 dating from the 1960s -- capped by the great 1963 fighter-pilot 
canvas, "Okay, Hot-Shot!," from the Geffen collection -- those combined 
holdings are especially rich in paintings and sculptures from Lichtenstein's 
most consequential period. 
</P>
<P>
 It only seems right. After all, not only are several of those collectors 
prominent in the entertainment industry, Los Angeles also seems an apt home for 
an art wittily conversant with the strange machinery of mass culture.

PROPERTY VALUES: FORECLOSURE CAN OFTEN RESULT IN COMPLICATED TAX BURDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the long slide in local housing prices, one boom market in local real 
estate has been foreclosures. Last year a record 3,650 single-family houses and 
condominiums in the Valley were foreclosed, according to TRW-REDI Property Data 
in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was before last month's Northridge earthquake. Given the hefty 10% 
deductibles most homeowners face on their earthquake-insurance policies, and 
because many people now have mortgages bigger than the value of their home, 
many homeowners figure to walk away from their mortgages and let the property 
go into foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for those whose homes escaped damage from the earthquake, the job market 
remains tough, and layoffs keep mounting, so many people will continue to have 
problems making their mortgage payment. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the reason, if a home is foreclosed on, that property owner 
faces plenty of complicated tax burdens. 
</P>
<P>
 If your home suffered significant earthquake damage, you may be eligible for 
special tax breaks -- although it depends greatly on the tax basis of your 
house and the size of your adjusted gross income. It will also probably take an 
accountant to sort out the couple dozen possible tax formulas on earthquake 
deductions. For do-it-yourself tax filers, start with additional information on 
earthquake disaster losses: Call the Internal Revenue Service and ask for 
Publications 547 and 584 on Nonbusiness Disasters and Publication 334, a Small 
Business Tax Guide. 
</P>
<P>
 As for homeowners who had foreclosure tax headaches even before the 
earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Ed and Ann Smith, who purchased their first home in Van Nuys in 1988 
for $190,000. They borrowed $152,000 to help pay for the house that today is 
worth only $130,000. Ed lost his job and the couple was four months delinquent 
on their mortgage in the fall of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 What would you do? 
</P>
<P>
 The Smiths -- whose names have been changed here to protect their privacy -- 
were very concerned about their credit rating. Facing foreclosure, they placed 
their home on the market and debated what to do when they found a buyer willing 
to pay the home's current $130,000 market value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smiths consulted an accountant about the tax implications of each 
alternative they were exploring. What the Smiths -- and many other financially 
strapped homeowners -- discovered was that the IRS considers debt forgiveness 
as taxable ordinary income. The IRS may also have a stake in any deferred 
capital gains associated with a foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting tax bill for a troubled homeowner can be staggering. The Smiths, 
for example, ended up with an $8,000 tax bill even though they lost money on 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smiths had three options, said their accountant Bob Solomon, a partner at 
West Los Angeles-based Levine, Cooper, Spiegel & Co. The first was to sell 
their Van Nuys home for $130,000 and turn that money over to their mortgage 
lender, along with the $20,000 still owed on their loan. 
</P>
<P>
 This would have left the couple with a $60,000 loss, $20,000 out of their 
pockets and no tax bill. It should be noted that if the Smiths had a deferred 
gain of, say, $100,000 on a previous residence, the tax basis of their $190,000 
home would have been $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a case, the IRS and California's Franchise Tax Board would demand 
their share of a $40,000 "gain" realized by the Smiths -- unless the couple had 
the wherewithal to roll over into another home within two years. This, of 
course, is easier said than done for a family already facing financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 The second option, Solomon recalled, was allowing the home to be foreclosed. 
The IRS considers a foreclosure to be a sale and the IRS deems the sales price 
equal to the loan balance. Here, the loss to the Smiths would be $40,000 and 
they would suffer the negative repercussions of a foreclosure. If this had been 
their second home -- as in the first option -- the IRS and Franchise Tax board 
would want their share of the Smith's $60,000 gain -- roughly $24,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A third option is the one that the Smiths chose. They sold the home for 
$130,000 and realized a loss of $60,000. Their lender forgave them the other 
$20,000 still owed on the loan, but the Smiths had to pay $8,000 in taxes for 
the $20,000 in debt forgiveness. If this had been their second home and they 
had rolled over a $100,000 gain from before, they would have had a $40,000 
"gain" and an additional capital gains tax obligation of about $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not confused by the numbers, you may be shocked by the size of the 
potential tax bills. The tax issue is further complicated because capital gains 
are taxed by the feds at about 28%, while the "ordinary income" of debt 
forgiveness is taxed on a sliding scale of 15% to 39%, depending on your tax 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still more complexity to a borrower's tax obligation when there's a 
foreclosure or debt forgiveness. First, when a debtor is insolvent, the IRS 
won't hold the debtor responsible for the debt cancellation to the extent of 
the debtors' insolvency. Second, if there's a foreclosure, a debtor who is 
personally liable for a debt may also have to pay tax for debt forgiveness, 
noted Steven M. Friedman, West region director of real estate advisory services 
at accounting firm Ernst & Young in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another twist to these tax rules is that cancellation of a debt obligation by 
a lender will no longer necessarily result in income for tax purposes. Many 
borrowers have complained that they've been hit not only with a reduction in 
their property values but also with a tax bill when a lender forgave some of 
their debt. Owners of commercial property will now be able to defer any 
"income" that results from debt forgiveness -- as long as the taxpayer owns 
another commercial property. Residential property owners should know, however, 
that this change only applies to commercial real estate. Starting last month 
lenders must fill out IRS form 1099 for any residential debt they forgive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tax implications of debt forgiveness and foreclosure are extremely 
complicated," said Chris Carlson, a tax partner at accounting firm Deloitte & 
Touche, which has offices in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 He advises troubled homeowners to sit down with an accountant and figure the 
tax bill on each of the options that are available. Also, if there is any 
deferred capital gains tax from previous residences, he said, all or part of 
that gain can continue to be deferred if the taxpayer buys another residence 
within two years or if the taxpayer is 55 or older.

TEACHER SENTENCED FOR FONDLING GIRL STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E. J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran Fullerton high school teacher was sentenced Monday to three years' 
probation and was stripped of his teaching credentials after pleading guilty to 
fondling and making sexual overtures to several female students. 
</P>
<P>
 George Melvin Fairchild, 53, a former life science and mathematics teacher at 
Sunny Hills High School, pleaded not guilty last August after he was ordered to 
stand trial on 15 charges of lewd and lascivious conduct, sexual battery and 
molesting a child under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, he reversed his plea, admitting to four of the charges. He fondled 
the breasts of three teen-age girls and made sexually suggestive comments to 
two girls, Fairchild told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge David O. Carter, who referred to 
Fairchild's acts as "offensive" and "damn serious," added two more guilty 
verdicts, for a total of six. He ordered Fairchild to receive psychological 
counseling and to perform 500 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jo Escobar said after the sentencing: "This was not a case 
of a teacher patting a student on the head." 
</P>
<P>
 During several months in 1992 and 1993, Fairchild fondled the students' 
breasts, commented on their breast sizes and once told a student that she 
should "use her body to get better grades." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Thomas Goethals and Fairchild could not be reached for comment 
after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 In emotional testimony before the sentencing, three victims, who remained 
anonymous throughout the non-jury trial, described the effects of the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been betrayed and lied to and emotionally damaged for life," one 
victim said. "This has totally shattered my image of trusting someone who says, 
'Trust me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said another victim: "What he has done to me can never be taken away or 
forgotten. The damage he did to me and the other girls was wrong, sick and 
perverted." 
</P>
<P>
 After the sentencing, Carter asked Fairchild's friends and family in the 
courtroom to help him overcome his "sickness." The judge then appealed to the 
victims and their families to begin healing and to reach out to other victims 
of sexual molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 By losing his teaching credentials, Fairchild will never be allowed to teach 
in the state of California. In addition, Fairchild will be registered as a sex 
offender, making it difficult for him to teach anywhere in the nation, Escobar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter also prohibited Fairchild from being alone with any girl under 18 years 
old as part of his sentence. Fairchild could face one to five years in jail if 
he violates his probation or other court stipulations. Fairchild is to appear 
again before the court on March 14 for an update on his counseling and 
probation.

HUGE PERFORMING ARTS CENTER PROPOSED FOR SANTA ANA; CONSTRUCTION: THE 
5,500-SEAT THEATER WOULD BE COUNTY'S LARGEST. DEVELOPERS ALSO ENVISION 180-ROOM 
HOTEL TO BE BUILT LATER. 
</P>

 A development firm has proposed building a hotel and performing arts center -- 
the biggest in Orange County -- next to the MainPlace mall in north Santa Ana, 
city officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5,500 seats, the enclosed theater would hold about 2,500 more people than 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Developers Moss & Co. 
of Santa Monica also want to build an 8- to 10-story, 180-room hotel on the 
3.47-acre site, but not for an additional seven to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no market for a hotel there now," said John Killen, agent for Moss & 
Co. He said he could not estimate how much the total project would cost because 
plans are still in flux. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the developers haven't decided what kind of events to hold 
at the proposed center because a management company hasn't been chosen yet. 
</P>
<P>
 According to planners, the project, proposed near the intersection of Main 
Street and Owens Drive, is in a preliminary stage. At a Feb. 10 meeting, area 
residents and property owners may suggest problems that should be studied in an 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Development plans probably won't go before the City Council for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanya Thomas, MainPlace/Santa Ana general manager, opposes the existing plan, 
fearing that people attending concerts will park cars in spaces belonging to 
the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers propose a 392-car parking structure at the center, and plans call 
for most of the concert patrons to park at office buildings away from the site 
and take shuttles to the theater.  
</P>
<P>
 However, said Thomas, "we believe theatergoers are going to park wherever it's 
most convenient." 
</P>
<P>
 Killen said the developers have an alternate plan that may include buying 
other nearby property to provide parking within walking distance of the venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Robyn Uptegraff, executive director of the city's Planning and Building 
Department, called the project concept "exciting" but said MainPlace is a 
"cornerstone of the city's commercial activity (and) we want to ensure no 
project negatively impacts it." 
</P>
<P>
 Main Street north of MainPlace is being widened to accommodate more traffic, 
Uptegraff said, but officials who planned the widening only took into account 
traffic patterns from current and future MainPlace stores and a project planned 
on the eastern side of Main -- not the concert hall and hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss & Co. representatives have met with neighborhood associations to discuss 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development could be of huge benefit to the area," said John Zarian, 
president of the West Floral Park Neighborhood Assn. "But everyone wants to go 
into it with their eyes open." 
</P>
<P>
 A concert hall would be the latest addition to Santa Ana's effort to become 
the county's urban and cultural hub.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's museum district, with the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art and a 
planned children's museum at its heart, lies to the south. And last year, the 
City Council approved the Main Street Concourse, a $500-million development 
proposed on the eastern side of Main Street.  
</P>
<P>
 That project would include the county's tallest office tower, townhomes, 
stores, a live theater and movie theater. Construction has not begun yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's proposed concert hall may feel stiff competition from other 
facilities. Whether the area can support another performing arts venue depends 
on what's presented there, said Victor Gotesman, general manager of the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hall could succeed if it stages programs that don't duplicate 
presentations at other nearby sites, said Gotesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a vast marketplace and there are certainly enough people to support 
the venues here now, if everyone develops their own particular niche," Gotesman 
said. "It's certainly worth a shot if the programming were developed carefully 
in conjunction with what the community needs were." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos center's annual operating budget is about $7.8 million, and it 
receives about $2 million of that from the city of Cerritos.  
</P>
<P>
 Killen said Moss & Co. have not asked the city to subsidize their proposed 
hall.

OLD BOAT, NEW VOYAGE; GIFT: TWO DOCTORS HAVE DONATED THEIR RACING SLOOP TO THE 
ORANGE COAST COLLEGE SAILING PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Dr. Robert Burns got a new racing boat, he and his sailing partner faced 
a decision of what to do with the Witch Doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 What they decided was to donate the $400,000 racing sloop, which Burns 
co-owned with Dr. Neil Barth, to Orange Coast College's sailing program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boat's purpose was truly that of a racing boat, and it deserves to be in 
a fairly prominent racing environment, which OCC has managed to establish and 
maintain," said Burns. "We wanted it to have a broader access to the community 
. . . and we knew it would be well taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 So in December, the 44-foot Witch Doctor -- a pun-like name that its physician 
co-owners took from the question, "Which Doctor?" -- sailed into North Lido 
Channel as the third major gift to the sailing program in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The two others are the Alaska Eagle, OCC's main floating classroom, and the 
Obsession, which was donated to the college in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that comes along very often," said Ann Owens, office 
coordinator for the sailing program. But when community residents think about 
what to do with a sailboat they aren't going to use anymore, they often think 
of OCC, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look to our program when they want to donate a boat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' reasons for donating the Witch Doctor were similar to those of Stephen 
R. Nichols, who said he wanted to make sure that his gift, a 70-foot, $800,000 
racing sloop named the Obsession, would be put to the greatest possible use in 
an established sailing program. He had also come to know Brad Avery, director 
of OCC's sailing program, through sailing races. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 people have taken courses in beginning sailing, navigation, 
maintenance, power boating and marine sciences at OCC, said Avery. And many of 
them get hooked for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They quit their jobs, sell their homes and sail away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the college now has the Witch Doctor, the Alaska Eagle will be able to 
take off on a yearlong cruise with students in July, without interrupting the 
studies of those who remain behind. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, beginners studying navigation, handling and anchoring of a 
sailing boat often had to wait several months each year for the Alaska Eagle to 
return from trips. No other boat was equally suitable for overnight cruising to 
Catalina and hands-on practice, said Avery. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the Witch Doctor is in. 
</P>
<P>
 The black and red boat won "First in Class" at the 1991 San Francisco Big Boat 
competition, a series of high-speed races around the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a wonderful boat," said Erica Christian, 26, a two-year participant 
in the sailing program. "It's very light, very fast. . . . It's a good basic 
boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Though fully equipped with 20 bags of sails and navigation equipment, the boat 
is also light enough for one person to handle the winches, said Christian. But 
it's large enough to comfortably accommodate six passengers for overnight 
voyages. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes in navigation, safety, marine diesel repair and other sailing-related 
skills will be held on the Witch Doctor, with about six students per session, 
said Avery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of the size people would have" if they bought their own boats, he 
said. "People can relate to the Witch Doctor. It has everything they would need 
to have to (learn about) cruising." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, some larger sloops have more room, said Christian, "but speed is 
everything and comfort is nothing. The Witch Doctor is both fast and 
comfortable."  
</P>
<P>
 Avery and a few students are still cleaning up the new floating classroom for 
use later in June, when it will begin taking students to the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Barth said he already misses his boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like giving a pet away," said Barth. "You give it to someone you know 
will take good care of it."

WATER OFFICIALS TOLD TO REPORT PAST GIFTS; UTILITIES: THE ORDER TO SANTA 
MARGARITA DISTRICT'S TOP EMPLOYEES FOLLOWS REVELATION OF GRATUITIES RECEIVED 
FROM CHIEF OUTSIDE ENGINEERING FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Top employees of the Santa Margarita Water District were ordered Monday to 
amend their statements of economic interest dating back a decade or more to 
include any free meals and gifts they failed to report receiving from those 
doing business with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager John J. Schatz said he ordered the action Monday after The 
Times reported that the district's two top engineers were treated to hundreds 
of meals and gifts valued at nearly $12,000 by the district's chief outside 
engineering firm between 1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based engineering firm of Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates 
provided the gifts -- including stays in resort towns -- to Bill Dye, the 
district's top engineer, and his assistant, Dan Ferons, during a four-year 
period in which the company was awarded nearly $12 million in contracts that 
were not competitively bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye, 58, has never reported receiving anything of value from any contractor on 
the statements of economic interest he has been required to file every year 
under state conflict-of-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferons, 34, has not been required to file statements of economic interest and 
was under no obligation to refrain from using his influence on Bein-Frost's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Political Reform Act of 1974 makes it illegal, however, for 
certain "designated officials" who receive gifts worth more than $250 in any 
one year to use their influence to steer any business to the gift-giver in the 
succeeding 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bein-Frost's spending on Dye, who has been one of the district's designated 
officials since 1979, surpassed that amount in each of the four years, yet Dye 
continued to recommend and vote on Bein-Frost contracts in apparent violation 
of the reform act. 
</P>
<P>
 In a press release issued late Monday, Schatz defended the two men, saying 
they had been "following the rules as they understood them prior to last year," 
when the district became embroiled in a scandal involving lavish spending of 
district funds by its two top managers, and their acceptance of at least 
$60,000 in gifts from engineering firms and other contractors they had 
recommended for lucrative district work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to last year, Bill (Dye) and other employees simply were not aware . . 
. that meals provided during working sessions with the district's engineers 
were reportable gifts," Schatz said, tacitly acknowledging that the gifts 
should have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Dye and other employees who file statements of economic interest, 
including the district's chief financial officer, operations manager and 
controller, are now being asked to retroactively review the total dollar amount 
of meals they were provided by vendors, and to amend their statements of 
economic interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz did not address reporting of anything other than meals, although Ferons 
received an all-expenses-paid trip to Orlando, Fla., from Bein-Frost, and Dye 
was treated to a stay in a Monterey hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz said he found no evidence to suggest that Dye and Ferons "ever received 
anything from vendors in exchange for recommendations to hire those vendors. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz skirted the issue of whether Dye violated state law by voting to 
recommend contracts to a firm from which he had accepted gifts in excess of 
state limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Dye received more than $5,000 from Bein-Frost between 1989 and 1992 
and would have been prohibited from voting on any contract involving Bein-Frost 
for the years 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Schatz's praise for Dye's and Ferons' "continued valuable 
contributions" to the district, one board member pledged to investigate their 
actions further and said nothing had been decided about either engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know the details and I want to know them now," said board member 
Bob Lay. "I intend to have a very serious chat with Mr. Dye and Mr. Ferons and 
ask them, very firmly, what was going on. This is not going to be swept under 
the rug." 
</P>
<P>
 Lay, one of three new board members elected in November after last spring's 
scandal, said he was disturbed by the disclosures and planned to raise them at 
Friday's engineering committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to do some investigating and I'm not sure how to start," Lay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ferons was not among those lower-level employees designated by the 
district to comply with the state law, he did not have to report the Bein-Frost 
gifts, which totaled more than $6,000 between 1989 and 1992. But Schatz said 
Ferons will be among a number of "second-tier" department supervisors who now 
will be required to file interest statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye has steadfastly refused comment on the matter. Ferons has referred all 
inquiries to Schatz. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye appears to be in a similar situation as his former bosses, ex-general 
manager Walter W. (Bill) Knitz and his onetime assistant, Michael P. Lord, who 
accepted thousands of dollars in entertainment and gifts from Bein-Frost and 
other companies they recommended for contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Knitz and Lord are under investigation by the district attorney's office 
and the FBI for possible conflict-of-interest law violations. Both took early 
retirement last May after the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon thereafter, Dye and other district employees were made aware, during a 
legal seminar sponsored by the district, that they were required to report such 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Dye challenged the need for him to file statements of economic 
interest because state guidelines called for the "district engineer" to file, 
while his title is "chief engineer." 
</P>
<P>
 In his press release, Schatz said that, "unfortunately, even following last 
year's events, Bill did not receive clear direction that prior years' 
statements could or should be amended."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; THOSE WHO WAIT FOR FOOD STAMPS FIND LONG LINES 
BUT LESS CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Because of the food stamp cheats, Barbara Brown could not replace the baby 
food she lost during the earthquake, could not pay her rent and had to wait all 
morning Monday in a half-mile-long line -- for the third time in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, thousands of people who suffered losses in the quake were granted 
emergency food vouchers the day they applied. But because of suspicions that 
many of the applications were fraudulent, a 72-hour waiting period was 
instituted to give county workers time to verify claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, because of the rip-off artists, people like me have to suffer," said 
Brown, a mother of two, as she waited in line at a Dodger Stadium parking lot. 
"If they had checked people out right from the beginning, instead of waiting, 
we would have had our food by now." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say they are now vigorously pursuing food stamp cheats, and 
one suspect was arraigned Monday in federal court. Four others are scheduled to 
be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 people waited in line Monday at Dodger Stadium, one of four 
large processing centers county officials opened in the hopes of avoiding the 
mass confusion of last week. There were extremely long lines last week at the 
29 county welfare offices, and numerous tales of abuse surfaced as about 50,000 
people applied for the emergency food vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, county officials tried to rectify the situation by establishing 
centralized application centers and steering applicants away from some of the 
overburdened county welfare offices. And by verifying claims, officials hoped 
to keep the cheats away. 
</P>
<P>
 Although people still waited in long lines Monday at Dodger Stadium and other 
sites, the processing program had fewer hitches than last week. The lines at 
the large centers moved quicker, there were more employees to handle the 
paperwork, and there was a large police presence to keep order. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still glitches that need to be addressed, said Lew Hollman, an 
attorney for San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services. The elderly and 
disabled are forced to wait in long lines in the hot sun, and the county has 
made no special provisions for them. And, he said, none of those who filled out 
the food stamp forms were given any paperwork to verify that they had applied. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could lead to major problems," Hollman said. "If 1,000 applications are 
lost, what happens to those people? Does that mean they've lost the chance to 
obtain any food stamps?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many people in line Monday were frustrated because they had waited in line 
last week, they were waiting again this week and, after filling out their 
applications, must wait three more days for their vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 72 hours of making a claim, applicants will be notified by mail that 
they can pick up their vouchers, which are provided through a U.S. Department 
of Agriculture program that is being managed by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside a Panorama City welfare office, more than 1,500 earthquake victims -- 
many without food or a place to sleep -- applied for food stamps. County 
employees used bullhorns to notify the crowd in Spanish, English and Armenian 
that there is now a waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people in line thought the waiting period would only hurt those 
who were in need. The scammers, they said, had gotten their food stamps last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who was doing wrong got what they wanted, and now the ones who are 
honest and really need it have to wait for three days," said Lydia Sanchez of 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez waited in line last Tuesday with her four children without obtaining 
any vouchers. She and her children are living on food donated by local 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Carter, who applied for food stamps for the first time on Monday, is 
living in a friend's motor home. His Van Nuys apartment was condemned after the 
earthquake and he lost his job as a customer service worker when his work site 
was heavily damaged. He blamed government officials for failing to prevent the 
fraud last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't that what computers are for?" Carter said. "It seems to me that the 
government ought to be able to check people pretty quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are now taking a number of precautions to prevent fraud. Every 
application will be cross-checked by the county's central computer system, said 
Mike Collins, a division chief for the county Department of Public Social 
Services. If people try to apply for the emergency food vouchers a second time 
or if they claim more dependents than the last time they applied for county 
benefits, their cases will be referred to fraud investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Brown waited four hours last week outside a Los Angeles welfare office 
until she finally gave up because the line was moving so slowly. She returned 
the next day at 5:30 a.m. and waited another few hours. When Brown finally met 
with a county worker, she was given an appointment to return Monday. But when 
she arrived at the welfare office, she was told to line up at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to spend all my money replacing food I lost during the earthquake 
and feeding my kids," Brown said. "I know some other people in that line last 
week didn't lose a damn thing. They just heard there was free money at the 
welfare office, so they just lined up with their hands out. Now the rest of us 
have to pay the price."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; THE 6.6 FIX; AFTER THE QUAKE, DOORS OPEN, A 
CLOCK TICKS, A BAD BACK IS BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the havoc it wrought, all the rubble it left behind, the Northridge 
quake also fixed a few things. 
</P>
<P>
 A broken wall clock, for example, that began ticking after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," said Sheila Shaler, whose Chatsworth home suffered heavy damage. 
"I have a Westminster chime clock and it hadn't been running for six months. It 
really startled me when it chimed." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other reports of resurrection by rock and roll. A chronically 
jammed door in Hollywood now swings freely. A Hermosa Beach car radio lost its 
irritating buzz. These and other such occurrences supplied quirky justification 
for that time-honored home remedy: If something doesn't work, jiggle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Shaler said of her clock, "I think the earthquake shook the 
you-know-what out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, such minor miracles pale in comparison to the billions of dollars 
in damages. In the past two weeks, appliance shops have been overwhelmed with 
requests to replace everything from shattered oven doors to torn water-heater 
pipes. Scores of television sets and computers required attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been silver linings. 
</P>
<P>
 A troublesome photocopier now performs without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the feeder, the thing that feeds paper into the machine," said Robert 
Manuwal, a Ventura Boulevard attorney. "I had a copier guy coming every other 
day and he couldn't fix it. Now it works fine. It's really strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Strange but not unexpected. Repairmen say that quake-inflicted repairs often 
involve electrical contact points that had fallen out of alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever had a flashlight that didn't work and, if you shook it, you 
could get it to switch on?" asked Scott Kassner, general manager of a North 
Hills appliance store. He explained that shaking sometimes causes contact 
points to reunite. "You make just enough of a circuit for the power to flow 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing may have happened during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the repairs were mechanical, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Frazier of Cerritos had suffered from an aching back for 10 years. "It 
hurt him every morning he woke up," said his wife, Shirley. Every morning, that 
is, until the day of the quake. Since then he has felt no pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks maybe the shaking of the bed shook something into place in his 
back," his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaking also caused larger adjustments. Some rigid plates that make up the 
Earth's outer shell were suffering from a good deal of strain before the quake 
provided relief. Crooked house frames were similarly jarred into alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Brastow of Topanga Canyon reports that the crack in her front porch, 
opened by a previous quake, has now closed considerably. She can tell because 
kitty litter from the cat box on the porch no longer gets stuck in the crack. 
</P>
<P>
 In other homes, doors and windows that had been sticking now open. For 
homeowners who suffered the reverse -- jammed doors -- there may be hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people to wait till the next one and maybe it will straighten itself 
out," said John Smith, who owns a Los Angeles carpentry service. "Nature works 
in funny ways." 
</P>
<P>
 The effects also extend beyond the purely practical. For the past year, artist 
Kilgore Bohorquez has been hard at work in a West Hills garage, assembling a 
massive piece that blends wood, metal and various other materials in a cross 
between classical sculpture and debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole garage settled and shifted," Bohorquez said, explaining that his 
artwork suffered partial damage but, in the process, became aesthetically 
complete. "The earthquake added a finishing touch. It added an element that I 
love, the element of spontaneity. There's no way I can be as spontaneous as an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 And the picture quality of his aging color television set improved to boot, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But earthquake-caused repairs may prove short-lived. Reunited contact points 
are likely to shift out of touch again. Pendulum clocks that were given a 
jump-start by the shaking will probably run down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Coffey, a Granada Hills clock repairman, says it reminds him of a radio 
evangelist who broadcast in Bakersfield during the 1950s. The evangelist 
claimed to repair broken watches if listeners would lay the watches atop their 
radios during his show. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did this when the weather was cold. People didn't realize that some 
watches don't work in cold weather, the grease gets too hard inside," Coffey 
said. "When his hour show was over, the watches were all warmed up and running. 
But they eventually stopped. It's the same with clocks that were fixed in the 
earthquake. They'll only work for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaler's clock, alas, stopped ticking several days ago. However, while 
clearing broken glass and the rubble of fallen chimneys, she can take some 
comfort from the unusual silence in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My refrigerator used to sound like a small diesel truck," she said. "A 
repairman came out twice before the earthquake and said the sound was normal. 
Now, it's purring like a kitten."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; NEW MOBILE HOME RULES CONSIDERED; DAMAGE: 
NEARLY 10% OF SUCH DWELLING UNITS IN L.A. COUNTY WERE RENDERED UNINHABITABLE BY 
THE QUAKE. SOME CALL FOR NEW BRACING REQUIREMENTS.

<P>
 Nearly 10% of all mobile homes in Los Angeles County have been declared 
uninhabitable as a result of earthquake damage, sparking renewed interest over 
whether costly safety measures should be required by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 51,062 mobile homes in parks in Los Angeles County, 4,947 were damaged by 
the magnitude 6.6 quake to the extent that they are not livable, said Travis 
Pitts, deputy director for codes and standards for the California Department of 
Housing and Community Development, which oversees mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them tumbled all the way off their support systems onto the ground," 
Pitts said. "Some shifted on their foundations enough that they are considered 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 184 were burned to the ground in fires fueled mostly by ruptured 
gas lines, one of which took the life of a 92-year-old woman at Sunburst Park 
Mobile Homes in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Mayor Richard Riordan toured three fire-damaged mobile home parks 
in Sylmar with City Councilman Hal Bernson, and both called for heightened 
seismic safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I've noticed is that most of this could have been avoided with 
some common sense measures," Riordan said. "We'll see what we can learn from 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitts said changes in safety standards are being drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state housing department has long favored requiring restraints to 
help keep mobile homes in place during earthquakes, strong opposition over the 
cost -- estimated at up to $3,000 per mobile home -- and the laborious process 
of justifying new regulations has kept such measures unrealized, Pitts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an issue of priorities and resources," Pitts said. "I think earthquake 
restraints will take a higher priority for us now, but I still don't have the 
staff or the resources to finish the regulation process right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining in support for added safety requirements is the state Seismic Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a preliminary report surveying the damage, the commission 
recommended that all mobile homes in California be secured to foundations on 
installation by July 1, 1995. In addition, the commission proposed that all 
mobile homes sold after Oct. 1, 1995, be anchored to foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 To place new requirements on mobile homes, the department must conduct 
exhaustive hearings and answer all concerns from the public to satisfy the 
staff of the Office of Administrative Law, which approves new regulations, 
Pitts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department proposed mandatory "sawhorse-type" supports twice during the 
1970s, Pitts said. But they were opposed by the Golden State Mobilehome Owners 
League, the state's only association of mobile home residents, on the grounds 
that the cost of installing supports -- usually in the $800-$3,000 range -- 
would keep people of lower incomes out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The devastation of the Northridge quake, plus a change in league leadership, 
could result in a change in that position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly don't oppose restraints now," said Golden State Vice President 
Pat Lowery, whose mobile home slid from its foundation during the quake. 
"Anything that will save our homes, we should do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, said Tony Hadley, vice president of the Manufactured 
Housing Institute, a national trade association, is that restraints used in 
states prone to hurricanes and tornadoes may not prevent mobile homes from 
slipping off their foundations during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is actually way ahead when it comes to safety standards," Hadley 
said. "They have at least done most of the necessary research." 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been proposals to require that mobile homes come equipped with 
devices that automatically shut off gas in case of an earthquake or ruptured 
gas line, Pitts said, but state officials and utility companies have been 
unsatisfied with their design. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the damaged homes in the San Fernando Valley and outlying areas will 
be livable once they are lifted back onto their foundations by using cranes or 
hydraulic jacks, Pitts said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may be weeks before thousands of mobile home dwellers -- many of whom 
are senior citizens -- can begin repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet P. LaCoe, 57, who lives alone at Northridge Mobile Home Park, said a 
close call during the earthquake persuaded her to install some sort of safety 
brace under her home once it is replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "My steps came off and blocked my door," LaCoe said. "I got out through a 
window but if there had been a fire, I might not have gotten out. And there are 
a lot of older ladies here who are lucky they made it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 John Quick, who suffered about $20,000 in damage in his home at the Tahitian 
Mobilehome Park, said he, too, would support mandatory restraints.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised that my home didn't stay up better than it did," Quick 
said. "They should require quake bracing because I don't think people will do 
it on their own."  
</P>
<P>
 State inspectors going park to park during the past two weeks found mobile 
homes next to their foundations or tilted, supports sticking through floors and 
ashes where homes once stood. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey by Pitts' department also found 559 of Ventura County's 9,425 
mobile homes unlivable.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 2 HIGH SCHOOLS WILL BE SHUT TILL MARCH; 
EDUCATION: DECISION TO KEEP DAMAGED EL CAMINO REAL AND KENNEDY CAMPUSES CLOSED 
UPSETS SOME PARENTS. IT GIVES 5,000 STUDENTS AN UNEXPECTED SEVEN-WEEK VACATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson said Monday that El Camino Real and John F. Kennedy high 
schools -- the two Los Angeles city secondary schools with the most earthquake 
damage -- will not reopen until March, a move that did not sit well with some 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision leaves 5,000 students scattered across the city with an 
unexpected seven-week winter vacation. In the interim, district officials plan 
to provide some instructional programs at El Camino using portable classrooms 
but no plans have been made yet for Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said at a news conference Monday that the March reopening followed 
the wishes of the staff of both schools to delay classes rather than 
temporarily divide students among other campuses. Public meetings were 
scheduled this week to address parents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have moved a lot of kids around this city and gotten them located . . 
. just so I could have said I got them back in school," Thompson said. "The 
important thing is to keep these kids back at their school sites." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a bottom line premise -- no young person will suffer from this 
educationally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District, which had about 14,000 students still 
out of quake-impacted schools Monday, sustained significant damage at about 170 
campuses. Most suffered architectural and cosmetic problems with a handful 
sustaining serious structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino has no structural damage but classroom partition walls were loosened 
and could collapse; Kennedy's three-story administration building suffered 
structural damage and will need rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson also announced that another eight schools will reopen today. They 
are: Andasol Elementary, Canoga Park Elementary, Castlebay Lane Elementary, 
Granada Hills High, Patrick Henry Middle School, Leonis Continuation School, 
Tarzana Elementary and Tulsa Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 11 schools will reopen later this week or next Monday. After that, 
only the two severely damaged high schools and Van Gogh Street Elementary in 
Granada Hills will remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Red Cross information, the district estimates that 836 students are 
staying at shelters throughout the city. On Monday, about 100 of those students 
were picked up by district buses and taken to their local schools, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at El Camino in Woodland Hills and Kennedy in Granada Hills were 
complaining Monday that they have been given little information about the 
schools' status and have been left out of the decision- making. Some parents 
said the district should be working faster to get their children back in their 
own school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really terrible. I think it's much too long," said Jay Lee, a parent 
with one child at El Camino. "I haven't been given any information. There's 
nothing for these kids to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Leder, another El Camino parent, said: "We don't pay enough attention to 
these kids. We're saying: 'We have broken down schools, no money and you don't 
count.' This is real hard on these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino plans to use portable classrooms to offer optional classes for 
Advanced Placement students and others preparing to take the SAT exam. Thompson 
said a program may also be offered for students who speak limited English. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about the kids that really need help, what's going to happen to them?" 
asked Evelyn Aragon, whose daughter is a junior at El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kennedy, Principal Andreda Pruitt said there are no plans for any optional 
classes during the break. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a very long time for school to be out," said Juliet Charles, a 
teacher's assistant at Kennedy whose daughter attends there. "I'm concerned 
about the students. I'm advising them to read and start practicing some math." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said there was no intent to exclude parents from decisions. But he 
said the district needed to examine its options in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 
quake before parent meetings could be held.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had to get our act together to tell them our options," Thompson said. "It 
would have been premature. We waited until we had a better feel for what the 
damage was." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino will hold a parents meeting on campus Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and 
Kennedy will hold two meetings -- at 7 p.m. Thursday at the school and next 
Monday at the school district's senior high division on 17th Street in 
Downtown.  
</P>
<P>
 Of El Camino's 2,700 students, 900 are bused from around Los Angeles. Of 
Kennedy's 2,300 students, about 1,000 are bused to school. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for some lost class time, officials said the two high schools 
probably will extend the school day by 39 minutes and the school year by two 
weeks to meet state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's top two education officials -- Acting Supt. of Public Instruction 
William Dawson and Maureen DiMarco, secretary of child development and 
education -- said they would not criticize the school closure decisions from 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for me to sit up here and second-guess the decisions that are 
being made locally on this issue at this time," Dawson said. "I'm not prepared 
to say that any of the decisions are inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Julie Korenstein, who represents Kennedy, said she cannot 
blame parents who are upset with the delay in resuming classes but supports the 
superintendent's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the most frustrating situation that I can imagine being in," 
Korenstein said. "This was a disaster and, of course, my preference would have 
been to get these kids back sooner but the schools made the decisions 
themselves. They did not want the kids scattered." 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Gogh Street Elementary in Granada Hills, which will undergo an 
extensive geological study, students will have to be relocated -- perhaps by 
next week, officials said. The students, which has deep fissures in the 
corridors and playground areas, probably will be relocated to Frost Middle 
School in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Popiel, a parent with one child at Van Gogh and another at Frost, said 
the lack of information from the schools has been frustrating and that the 
district should have been more responsive to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would just like to know what's going on with our schools -- and more 
officially and not from calling the school offices or reading the newspaper," 
Popiel said. "It would be nice to get official word on what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost is scheduled to reopen Wednesday, with about 15 classes relocated to 
other classrooms because of water damage, officials said. School Reopenings The

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
FIRM OFFERS FREE HOUSING TO ELDERLY QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Costa Mesa-based company that provides assisted living to senior citizens 
announced Monday that it will provide free, temporary housing for elderly 
victims of the Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Seniors can choose a furnished unit at senior apartment communities owned by 
ARV Housing Group in Redondo Beach, Azusa, Pomona, Claremont, or at three 
retirement villas in Covina, San Dimas and Walnut, said company spokesman 
Bernard Sandalow.Housing is also available in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandalow said the offer is good through March 1. Seniors will be accommodated 
on a first-come, first-served basis and will be under no obligation to buy or 
rent the facility in which they stay, he said. The program is being offered in 
cooperation with the Los Angeles chapter of the American Red Cross, Sandalow 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; COUNCIL TO DECIDE ON POOL HALL'S LICENSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will decide today whether to license the opening of a local 
billiard business that has drawn opposition from its prospective neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has already opposed the project, and the council must 
decide whether the Yorba Linda Family Pizza and Entertainment center will be a 
pool hall that might attract gangs and bored teen-agers or a billiard parlor 
serving families and white-collar professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and businesses in the Lakeview Shopping Center say the project would 
be a drag on nearby businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of business will eventually become a hangout and will only bring 
additional problems to an area already plagued by gangs, drugs and graffiti," 
Mike Aversa said. "A pool hall, which is open very late in the evening, will do 
nothing but attract outsiders into our community." 
</P>
<P>
 But prospective owners David Duncan, Maureen Holthe and Tom Laspada call their 
proposed establishment a billiards center. 
</P>
<P>
 They cite statistics that show billiards is popular among middle-class 
families and college graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smoky pool hall is a thing of the past. New (billiards) rooms are opening 
across the country that are family-oriented and offer a very comfortable 
atmosphere for the young and the old," the three partners wrote in a letter to 
the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission rejected Yorba Linda Family Pizza and Entertainment's 
application last November, citing insufficient parking and opposition from 
nearby residents and other businesses in the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also turned in a petition with more than 1,200 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The most visible opposition to the project came from residents of Villa 
Pacifica, a nearby senior citizens apartment complex whose residents walk to a 
grocery store in the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents have said they would not feel safe in the shopping center if 
the billiards center opened there. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project is not without supporters, mostly residents who have met 
Duncan and Laspada at the pair's other local business, Yorba Linda Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son grew up at Yorba Linda Bowl," said Ron Sakahara, an architect who has 
lived here for 13 years. "I know both (Duncan and Laspada), and I think what 
they want to do is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Sakahara, who plays at pool clubs around the county, is impressed with the 
plan to keep the proposed billiards center a nonalcoholic, smoke-free facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the junior program they want to introduce there, it would become a real 
family environment," he said. "We need more places like this in Yorba 
Linda."DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 'VERTIPORT' URGED FOR SITE NEAR DISNEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young on Monday proposed placing a "vertiport" for 
vertical takeoff and landing aircraft atop a planned parking and transit garage 
next to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, to be built if the Walt Disney Co. proceeds with plans for its 
Westcot addition to Disneyland, would be one of the world's largest parking 
garages. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a deal worked out between several government agencies, parking revenue 
would be reserved for transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The garage would also serve as a bus and urban rail stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking beyond helping the business of one company, we'll be able to link the 
bus system with automobiles and" urban rail, said Young, who chairs an 11-city 
urban rail advisory group. "And we'll be able to look at putting VTOL on top of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Young said vertical takeoff and landing aircraft would be ideal for trips to 
Santa Barbara, Bakersfield and San Diego and would fill unmet travel needs of 
both business people and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's comments came during a transportation planners' conference at the 
Anaheim Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor, who serves on the Orange County Transportation Authority board, 
also predicted that studies soon to be completed by OCTA will support 
construction of an elevated urban rail line that would run between the South 
Coast Plaza/Irvine Spectrum/John Wayne Airport area and either Disneyland or 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 With regard to the VTOL pad, Young said he hasn't formally proposed it to OCTA 
because Disney officials haven't yet made a final decision to build Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 VTOL discussions highlighted parts of the conference, which focused on linking 
various modes of transport. 
</P>
<P>
 Several speakers said VTOL technology can contribute to the overall mix of 
transfer options, relieving existing airports as well as providing new links 
between various places within the same region. 
</P>
<P>
 A VTOL facility is planned for Atlanta, and another was recently built in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cliff Bragdon of Long Island's Dowling College created the biggest stir. 
He urged planners to abandon their two-dimensional land-use thinking in favor 
of "space planning" that accounts for all human senses, including smell. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited plans for a 32-story complex to be build underground in Osaka, Japan, 
with a park on the bottom floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of smell is important, too, Bragdon said, so planners must take 
"spacescapes" into account, "not landscapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he reported, airline passengers will be given whiffs that can aid sleep 
on overseas flights, and new cars will be equipped to emit scents that help 
drivers stay awake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Single buildings for single purposes are archaic, as are the people who 
design them," Bragdon said. "Those people should be eliminated." JEFFREY A.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; WORKSHOP TO AIR DOHENY VILLAGE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City planners will present three visions for the future of the historic, 
150-acre Doheny Village at a public workshop at 7 tonight at Capistrano Beach's 
Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 The bowl-shaped village beneath the Interstate 5 freeway in Capistrano Beach 
could remain the sleepy, small-town community it has been for decades or become 
the major industrial and commercial base of the city, depending on which plan 
is ultimately chosen by the City Council, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A straw vote on three alternatives will be taken among those attending the 
workshop, said Michael Philbrick, an associate city planner. The results of the 
voting will be aired during an upcoming joint session of the city planning 
commission and City Council, Philbrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing written in stone," Philbrick said. "Everything is still 
subject to change. . . . None of the plans are for actual development. They are 
more like a blueprint of what could occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Philbrick said city officials expect to come up with a fourth plan from 
suggestions that arise during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The three current plans were based on a marketing study of the village, and 
each divides the area into six parcels, Philbrick said. The city will study 
both low- and high-density development in each parcel and ultimately make a 
decision on which combination of land uses the council prefers, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the alternatives include a train station to make use of the double set 
of railroad tracks that traverse the village, Philbrick said. One of the plans 
calls for extending the train station into a center for multiple types of 
transportation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three plans also calls for relocating the Capistrano Unified 
School District's large bus yard, officials said. The least intense plan calls 
for transforming the yard into a park, while the others suggest developing it 
into a residential area or a commercial office area, Philbrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the 169-space Beachwood Mobile Home Park will also be a topic of 
discussion, Philbrick said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
QUAKE DAMAGES HOME OF FIREFIGHTER SHOT IN RIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fate has been unusually cruel for Scott Miller: The firefighter was shot 
during the riots and his San Fernando Valley home was severely damaged in the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fire captain does not believe that the riots and earthquake have much 
in common. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's apples and oranges. They're completely different animals, completely 
different types of events, with completely different types or origins," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the magnitude 6.6 quake struck Jan. 17, Miller, his wife, Kathi, and 
their children, Ryan, 7, and Julianne, 5, were asleep in their Granada Hills 
home just a few miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The house cracked, items flew off shelves and a 300-pound piano danced away 
from a wall as the earth groaned beneath them. The Miller family scampered 
outside into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could see fires in five different directions," said Miller, who was shot 
after responding to a fire on April 29, 1992, just hours after a jury acquitted 
four police officers in the beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake cracked the foundation of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worse than some, not as bad as others," Miller said. "As a city, we're 
awfully darn lucky we didn't lose more people. You just roll with the punches 
and keep on going."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; CITY STUDIES ANNEX OF FOOTHILL RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slowly, cautiously, the city is looking into annexing the massive, potentially 
lucrative Foothill Ranch housing development. 
</P>
<P>
 With the planned 3,900-unit development incomplete and an economic recession 
still gripping the state, city officials say they are easing their way into the 
complicated annexation process. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lake Forest hasn't filed official annexation papers yet, the city 
recently completed a preliminary study and made initial contact with the 
county, which runs the unincorporated community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have agreed (among the council) to move very slowly with the annexation 
because of recessionary times," said Councilwoman Ann Van Haun. "There is a lot 
of work that has to be in place before we can start" filing annexation papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Ranch is on the north city border. Currently about 1,611 houses have 
been completed and build-out is anticipated in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,743-acre development could provide a significant sales tax windfall for 
the city. The project's centerpiece is a 113-acre retail "power center" that 
will showcase 1.2 million acres of building space. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants already signed for the Foothill Ranch Towne Centre include Walmart, 
which will move into a 125,000-square-foot structure, and Homebase, a discount 
store that plans to occupy a 130,000-square-foot building. The center will also 
have a 24-screen movie complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping and entertainment complex would be the second largest in the 
county after South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue potential of Foothill Ranch will probably be matched by the task 
of persuading the county to allow the annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials reiterated on Monday that their annexation policies are 
unchanged.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; TAPPING A RESERVOIR OF HUMAN KINDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Greenberg was annoyed with himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaced victims of the Northridge earthquake were struggling through cold 
and rain, and he was just sitting back, doing nothing, in the warmth and 
comfort of his Leisure World home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling guilty, because all I was doing was expressing sympathy for 
them, but not doing anything," Greenberg recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jan. 25, he telephoned the Red Cross and offered to organize a drive for 
clothing and food. Told that the agency would take whatever he could collect, 
Greenberg sprung into action. 
</P>
<P>
 Too late to make arrangements to use a Leisure World recreation center as a 
collection point, he decided his single-car garage would just have to do. 
Needing to get the word out, he persuaded the community paper to squeeze in a 
few paragraphs just before deadline announcing his effort. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday morning, when the paper hit doorsteps, Greenberg knew he'd done 
the right thing. His phone began ringing every few minutes and cars started 
pulling up at the driveway with people dropping off warm clothes and 
non-perishable food. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next three days, the Greenberg house became the epicenter of Leisure 
World's earthquake donation drive. While his wife, Elenor, answered the 
repeatedly ringing phone, Greenberg met the steady stream of people who came up 
the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came by the droves. Hundreds of people came," he said, beaming. "It was 
almost like a traffic jam. They would come two and three at a time, dropping 
things off and saying they appreciated the opportunity to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Some who came had tears in their eyes, Greenberg said. And some donated things 
that you'd think they'd never part with -- like the woman who brought four 
quilts made by her mother, saying, "Those people need them more than I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg and a friend also made house calls to pick up items that people were 
unable to deliver themselves. By Sunday, the garage was filled with bags and 
boxes of canned and dried food, shoes, sweaters, comforters, blankets and 
quilts. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a monument to the better side of human nature, the pile stood five feet 
high, eight feet wide and 22 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tapped into something with this," he said. "The lesson for me is that 
people want to help. Sometimes they just need an avenue, they need someone to 
tell them what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Red Cross is sending a truck to the Greenberg residence to pick up 
all that he collected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Greenberg's efforts have been above and beyond what most people are able 
to accomplish," said Al Wynder, the Orange County Red Cross' assistant director 
of financial development and corporate relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the agency doesn't accept donations of food and clothing. But it 
made an exception after the earthquake because so many people called to offer 
what they had, Wynder said. Catholic Charities will distribute the items to 
those in need in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that, Greenberg said, allowed him to shake off the bad feeling he had 
a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a modest guy," he said, "but it sure makes me feel good." RICHARD CORE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; AMTRAK 
ADDS 3RD TRAIN ON ROUTE TO SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A third, round-trip passenger train between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara will 
begin running today to help ease the city's post-quake congestion, the 
president of Amtrak announced.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Downs said the nation's passenger train line also will help Metrolink 
meet the skyrocketing demand for commuter rail service to the Antelope 
Valley.As a contract operator of Metrolink service, Amtrak will help expand 
schedules, find extra equipment, upgrade tracks and provide additional crews 
for the trains, Downs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita line, serving Antelope Valley communities all but cut off 
from the Los Angeles Basin by the collapse of the Golden State and Antelope 
Valley freeway interchange, now runs 21 trains each weekday. Ridership has 
jumped from about 1,000 passenger trips per day to more than 19,000.  
</P>
<P>
 The Amtrak line from Santa Barbara stops at Ventura, Oxnard, Moorpark, Simi 
Valley, Chatsworth, Van Nuys, Burbank Airport, Glendale and Union Station 
before going to San Diego.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; WELFARE OFFICE CLOSE TO GETTING NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county's Social Services Agency is close to an agreement that would 
relocate a controversial welfare office that Anaheim residents have blamed for 
creating crime and loitering at a nearby park, county officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is completing a lease agreement that will move the current Homer 
Street welfare office, near La Palma Park, to a commercial area at 2929 White 
Star Ave., said Robert A. Griffith, chief deputy director of the social 
services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that the deal is also contingent on the county's selling 
the current welfare office site to the city. "That's where the money for the 
new lease will come from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was prompted by complaints from city officials and nearby residents, 
he said, adding that the current office is too old and too small to meet the 
county's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, several council members called upon the county to move the office. 
County officials were willing to relocate, but said they lacked the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner made the relocation a priority of 
his shortly after getting into office last March. He said local community 
groups brought the problem to his attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very encouraged that we are going to move this facility into a more 
appropriate area," Steiner said Monday. "It's something that I've been pushing 
pretty hard for." 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare office has been at its Homer Street location for more than a 
decade and has been a target of complaints for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents charged that welfare recipients loiter in the park and drink alcohol 
or use drugs there after picking up their welfare checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The news that the welfare office relocation was imminent pleased residents 
near the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that we've been working hard for," said Harald Martin, a 
police officer who lives in the area. "We're pretty happy about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and members of a group called Somebody dumped cow manure in the park 
last year to draw attention to the drug use there. 
</P>
<P>
 "By moving the office, they're going to remove the customers of the drug 
dealers," Martin said. "We should see a marked decrease in crime." MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; CITY TO WEIGH ZONING OF PERSONAL SERVICES 
</P>

<P>
 The City Council today will consider whether to allow massage establishments 
and tattoo parlors to operate in the town center, the main business corridor 
through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Department last month recommended confining such "personal 
service establishments" to other parts of the city.Personal services would 
include massage and tattoo, acupressure, acupuncture and other similar 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the planners' proposal was challenged when it went before the council 
by a massage therapist, who said that it would force her business away from 
chiropractic and medical offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Hershey said she receives most of her clients from physicians and 
chiropractors. And a spokesman for the owner of a retail center in the town 
center said a massage therapist would be compatible with the medical offices 
located there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resent being lumped together with tattoo parlors," said Hershey, a licensed 
massage therapist. "I have to go through extensive training to be licensed by 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the ordinance was modified. The proposal before the council would 
allow all such business to locate in any commercial zone, provided they receive 
a conditional-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The town center includes the area surrounding City Hall and the shopping 
centers at Yorba Linda and Kraemer boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 These areas are seen as gateways to the city and are zoned for traditional 
retail and professional businesses. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; EX-MWD DIRECTOR SENTENCED TO PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Orange County director of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California was sentenced Monday to three months in prison and fined $10,000 for 
federal income tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl J. Kymla of Costa Mesa, a 20-year member of the MWD board and a former 
city councilman in Newport Beach, also must spend three months in a community 
confinement center during a three-year period of supervised release, according 
to the sentence handed down by U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Kymla is scheduled to turn himself in to begin his sentence March 14, said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Kimberly Dunne. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Kymla nor his attorney, Paul Raymond, returned phone calls for comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kymla, who runs Newport Beach-based Municipal Services Consultant Inc., 
pleaded guilty last October to one count of failing to report approximately 
$75,000 of income on his 1987 tax return, Dunne said. He also admitted failing 
to report approximately $140,000 in income in 1986, Dunne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he faced a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine after 
being indicted in 1993 on two counts of tax evasion, "as part of a plea 
agreement, the government moved to dismiss one count," Dunne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kymla resigned from his seat on the 51-member MWD board last October just 
before entering his guilty plea. He served on the board as a director appointed 
by the Municipal Water District of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 As an MWD director, Kymla had been chairman of the special budget committee 
since its inception in 1976. The committee had the final word on MWD's 
$820-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, Kymla was the general manager of the Moulton Niguel Water District in 
Laguna Niguel and one of five district officials indicted on felony charges of 
misappropriating district property, including using district equipment and 
employees to handle chores around his home. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, prosecutors admitted that their evidence against Kymla was weak 
and charges were dismissed against him in February, 1979. He retired from the 
district post one day later.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; STING YIELDS 3 ARRESTS, 1,976 LBS. OF COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of a joint narcotics investigation unit seized nearly one ton of 
cocaine and arrested three people allegedly involved in the Orange County-based 
conspiracy, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators with the Regional Narcotics Suppression Program, together with 
the FBI, seized 1,976 pounds of cocaine Thursday at an unoccupied Cerritos 
residence, according to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 The cocaine, with an estimated street value of $35 million, was wrapped in 
kilo-sized packages that were stacked in cardboard boxes and loaded in a pickup 
truck in the residence's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Four suspects, all believed to be Colombian nationals, were arrested at other 
residences in Cerritos, Diamond Bar and Redondo Beach, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the three adults arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking 
as: Marina Cardona Hernandez, 47; Juan Castro, 28; and Juan Callos-Cardona 
Cifuentes, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult suspects are all being held in the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified, 16-year-old female juvenile was also arrested and released to 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they believe the Cerritos residence where the cocaine was 
seized was recently leased in order to store and distribute even larger 
quantities of the drug as part of a ring responsible for smuggling throughout 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini noted that the seizure was the first of its kind for the Regional 
Narcotic Suppression Program since the state's Asset Forfeiture Law expired 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The suppression unit is partially funded by seized assets, Martini said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; NEIGHBOR RESCUES MAN, 61, FROM FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire officials Monday credited a quick-acting neighbor with rescuing a man in 
a wheelchair from his burning apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 p.m. Sunday, 61-year-old Richard Masse was pulled from his burning 
apartment in the 12100 block of Bayport Street by his neighbor, Sandy Ramirez, 
according to Ellen Covey, a Garden Grove Fire Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's daughter and a friend called 911 to report the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Joe Chandler said that if Ramirez had not pulled Masse -- who 
is physically disabled and in poor health -- from the apartment, he would 
probably have died in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A second resident of the apartment, Robert Graham, 24, sustained second degree 
burns to his face and was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange for treatment 
and observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials have not determined the cause of the fire, which gutted the 
apartment. There was $60,000 damage to the structure and $20,000 to the 
contents, authorities said. Three residents of an upstairs apartment were also 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Masse and Graham are being provided emergency housing and assistance by the 
Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; BUILDING SCHOOL AT MALL TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of residents are expected to attend a public hearing tonight to offer 
comments on a controversial plan to build a new fundamental intermediate school 
at a local shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, proposed by the Santa Ana Unified School District, calls for a 
$43-million "space-saver" school to be built on a 11-acre site at the rear of 
Bristol Market Place, at 17th and Bristol streets. The district Board of 
Trustees will consider the plan at tonight's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The site for the proposed campus has drawn widespread criticism from residents 
who believe a school there would increase traffic, crime and noise in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say a new school would better serve the community if built 
elsewhere, and charge that the district has failed to adequately investigate 
other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents support the plan as a way to alleviate overcrowding throughout 
the district, and hail the board's recent decision to make the campus a 
fundamental school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamental schools, which are extremely popular with parents, combine 
traditional instructional programs with strict dress codes and behavioral rules 
and strong parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 98,000-square-foot campus would accommodate 1,300 students from sixth 
through eighth grades, easing a space crunch at other intermediate schools, 
said Mike Vail, senior director of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Building new campuses is crucial, he added. By 2000, local intermediate 
schools will house about 5,000 more students than their designed capacities. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the addition of the planned Raymond A. Villa Intermediate School and 
the space-saver campus, the number of intermediate students would still exceed 
designed capacities by about 2,400 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-funded project is designed as an innovative way to maximize the use 
of land, while ensuring that no businesses or homes are condemned to make room 
for the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the project is intended to be a model for other districts statewide, 
it would receive funding priority and be built years earlier than would 
otherwise be possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting will be held at 6:30 at Phillips Hall on the Rancho Santiago 
College campus, at 17th and Bristol streets.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; BOYS CLUB HONORS 1ST WOMAN ON ITS BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donna Bagley will never forget that day in November, 1957, when she was asked 
to join the all-male board of directors for the Boys Club of Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I laughed -- because they were all men," said Bagley, who will turn 82 in 
March. "They told me they needed a mother's viewpoint. This one man thought I 
had the courage to be a pioneer." 
</P>
<P>
 That board member was right. The civic- and community-minded Bagley did take 
that courageous step and accepted the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 She became the first woman to serve on the board. "I was the one that broke 
the ice," she said, adding she found it a "challenge and a responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley, mother of two sons, one of whom died in a car accident as a teen-ager, 
retired from the board this month after 36 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was given the honorary title of "historical consultant" because of the 
wealth of knowledge she has about the club's early years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley has also received another title. Because of her dedication and service 
to the club, she was honored as the organization's "Volunteer of the Year" on 
Saturday at an annual volunteer and donor recognition dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gives a lot of time and effort unselfishly -- and with no pay. And I 
think her heart is in it," said fellow board member Larry Stern, who has served 
with Bagley for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said Bagley has always been in the forefront in coming up with ways the 
club could secure money from donors to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the first one to be there because she's concerned about the kids," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During her more than three decades as a board member -- never serving as 
president because she "didn't want to be president" -- Bagley was instrumental 
in raising money to keep the club open and expanding programs for the youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the club, which is now open to both boys and girls ages 6 to 17, 
has a membership of 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley, who for 35 years operated an income tax service, also managed to find 
time to frequent the club "to let kids know we were interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley has been involved in the community since she and her husband of 50 
years, Wallace, moved to Buena Park in 1948 and bought a home in the city's 
second housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after they moved to the city, Bagley joined the Buena Park Woman's Club 
and has been active in that organization ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Bagley has been publicly recognized for her community 
endeavors and volunteerism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had more satisfaction, more recognition and more awards than any one 
person deserves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But being honored as the club's top volunteer may be the highlight of her 
life, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm overwhelmed," said Bagley, who still cooks, sews her own clothes, knits 
and attends the same church she has belonged to for the past 42 years. "I've 
had so many awards, but I think this may be more meaningful than anything 
that's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley, a grandmother of four, said she was touched when she saw an ad last 
week in the program for Saturday's event that thanked her for her service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just thinking about it brings tears to my eyes," she said. "It means a great 
deal to me to be part of this wonderful organization." 
</P>
<P>
 While getting another award is an honor, the real reward is knowing that she 
has made a difference in the lives of youngsters. "I've tried to be a good role 
model for young people as a caring person," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And being involved in her community is something she will never give up. "This 
is where I belong. I've been a part of Buena Park, and Buena Park is a part of 
me," she said.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FIRE OFFICIALS DISPUTE ALLEGATIONS IN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire Department officials on Monday disputed allegations that a mentally 
disabled man died Thursday because of inadequate fire equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the fire was so intense that no one could have saved Mark D. York, 
34, who died of smoke inhalation when flames engulfed Christian Residential 
Care, a board-and-care home on Candlewood Street. 
</P>
<P>
 His body was found in a bathroom on the bottom floor of the two-story 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garrison, a director of the Westminster Firefighters Assn. Local 2425, 
said that York's death could have been avoided if a firetruck at Station 2, the 
fire station closest to the fire, had not been put out of service last year as 
part of a reorganization of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Herr, the department's chief investigator, found that it would not have 
made a difference if a firetruck, which has special equipment to puncture holes 
on roofs for ventilation, had arrived with the first fire engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Charles V. Smith and Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman have scheduled a 
noon press conference today to answer the union's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. also is scheduled to provide additional 
details about the investigation into the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials described Garrison's charge as irresponsible and premature 
because the investigation had not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest salvo in the continuing feud between members of the council 
and firefighters' union, which is supporting a recall drive against Smith, 
Bohman and Councilmen Craig Schweisinger and Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the firefighters have until Feb. 19 to gather 6,937 signatures 
to force a recall election. BERT ELJERA

SUIT BY DENNY, 3 RIOT VICTIMS CLEARED BY JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge refused Monday to dismiss a lawsuit against the city of Los 
Angeles by trucker Reginald O. Denny and three other 1992 riot victims, 
clearing the way for a trial that may begin later this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Denny, Wanda Harris, Takao Hirata and Fidel Lopez contend that Los Angeles 
police left them at the mercy of their assailants in the neighborhood 
surrounding Florence and Normandie avenues during the early stages of the riot 
because the area is predominantly black. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' 15-year-old son was shot and killed a block from the Florence and 
Normandie intersection, a flash point of the civil unrest. Denny, Hirata and 
Lopez were beaten in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. granted a motion by Assistant 
City Atty. Annette Keller to dismiss claims by the plaintiffs in which they 
allege that they were deprived of their constitutional right to due process of 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the judge said all four plaintiffs can proceed with their claim that 
they were denied equal protection of the law. To prevail in the suit, the 
plaintiffs must prove that the police pulled out of the area because most of 
the residents were African American. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court in 1989 ruled that police departments have no specific 
duty to provide the public with adequate protective services. However, it also 
ruled that the state may not selectively deny protective services to certain 
"disfavored minorities" without violating equal protection of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great day for the plaintiffs," said Denny's attorney, Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr. "This case is real important for everyone," because what happened 
to Denny during the riot showed that anyone could be injured because of 
governmental actions based on race, Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne based his decision partly on a 1989 Ohio federal court decision in which 
white residents of Canton were allowed to sue the city based on claims that 
police were failing to protect them because they lived in a primarily black 
area, said Constance L. Rice, an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, one of three public interest law groups assisting Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have discrimination based on policy, it doesn't matter who the victim 
is," Rice said. "You have to look at what happened (during the riots), and why 
it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union and the Asian Pacific American Legal Center 
also joined in a brief supporting the plaintiffs' contention that their suit 
should be allowed to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he found it ironic that his suit was based on a statute designed to 
benefit minorities, Denny said he felt he was entitled to use the law because 
the police had fled the area. Denny said he and his friends find a good deal of 
what goes on in court perplexing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just a bunch of truck drivers," he said. "The speed limit is 55 m.p.h. 
The only law I know is red lights." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants in the case include the city, former Los Angeles Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates and former Deputy Chief Matthew Hunt, who headed the 
department's South Bureau during the riots. The other defendants are Deputy 
Chief Ronald A. Frankle; Deputy Chief Ronald C. Banks, now chief of staff to 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams; Paul Jefferson, who was a ranking official in 
the South Bureau at the time of the riots and is now the chief of police in 
Modesto, and former LAPD Lt. Michael Moulin, now retired on a stress pension. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar case on behalf of Denny and two of the three plaintiffs in the 
federal suit is pending in Los Angeles Superior Court. Four other cases filed 
by riot victims were dismissed by Superior Court judges, who agreed with the 
city attorney's position that the city is immune from such suits. 
</P>
<P>
 However, none of the suits that were dismissed contained allegations that 
there was racially discriminatory deployment of police resources.

HARASSMENT CLAIM REJECTED ; INQUIRY: STATE AGENCY DECLINES TO ACT ON CHARGE BY 
EX-AIDE OF COUNCILMAN NATE HOLDEN. OFFICIALS GIVE NO REASON, BUT SAID EARLIER 
THAT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS MIGHT HAVE EXPIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A state agency has declined to file a sexual harassment accusation against Los 
Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden that stemmed from complaints by a former 
aide that lewd comments and unwanted advances by Holden created a sexually 
charged atmosphere in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing means that 
onetime Holden aide Connie Collins cannot receive damages through an 
administrative hearing, but she is still free to file a lawsuit against her 
former boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the state agency declined to say Monday why they did not sustain 
Collins' complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the agency said Collins' complaint was problematic because it 
might have been filed after the expiration of a one-year statute of 
limitations. Agency officials would not say Monday if the time limit was a 
factor in their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden's attorney, Tim Agajanian, called the decision "a great moral and legal 
victory for Councilman Holden." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden, in a statement, said he believes that sexual harassment lawsuits by 
two other former employees also will be dismissed. "There was never an ounce of 
truth to what Ms. Collins or my former employees alleged," said Holden, who has 
maintained that the allegations were trumped up to deflate his 1993 campaign 
for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins could not be reached for comment. But Melanie Lomax, who once 
represented Collins, called the state's action "hardly a vindication of Nate 
Holden." 
</P>
<P>
 Lomax said that before she left the case last year, the agency "had already 
raised serious questions about whether the events took place outside the 
statute of limitations." 
</P>
<P>
 Agajanian said the state agency's study of the facts in the case showed that 
Collins "could not have prevailed." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins was the second of three former Holden aides to complain in late 1992 
and early 1993 that Holden had ogled or inappropriately touched them while they 
were his employees at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden vehemently denied the accusations. He contended that Lomax had 
influenced two of the women to file the claims in an effort to block his bid 
for mayor. The councilman said Lomax held a grudge against him because he did 
not vote for her when the City Council rejected her appointment to a city 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits by former employees Carla Cavalier and Marlee Beyda are pending, as 
is Holden's countersuit against Cavalier and Lomax for defamation.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CAR DEALERS GIVEN PAYMENT PLAN ON BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, acting as the Community Development Agency, has approved a 
request to let the Auto Dealers Assn. pay a $25,000 landscaping bill in 12 
monthly payments instead of one lump sum payment. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto dealers received the bill in August for maintaining the landscaping 
on the slope of the Garden Grove Freeway next to the auto center on Trask 
Avenue, west of Brookhurst Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gary L. Alwood, vice president of the Garden Grove Auto Center, said in a 
letter urging city officials to extend the payment over a period of time that 
"a downturn in the car business made payment difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials recently agreed to the request and will charge a monthly interest 
rate of 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 In cooperation with the auto dealers, city officials in November, 1990, agreed 
to remove tall oleander bushes and other plants that blocked visibility of the 
auto center from the freeway and planted low-lying vegetation at a cost of 
about $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual maintenance cost for the landscaped area is $25,219 a year. The 
Community Development Agency paid that cost for the first 42 months. The auto 
dealers had agreed to continue the maintenance payments after that period. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto dealers also asked the agency to consider funding a replacement of 
the blue face on the Auto Center sign at the center. They said the blue panel 
has been faded by the sun and detracts from the appearance of the sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials asked staff employees to look into the request. The sign replacement 
is estimated to cost $9,000. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; BOARD WILL ASSESS ITS SCHOOL SAFETY EFFORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District's Board of Education will review its 
yearlong effort to improve school safety and reduce youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion will give school officials and board members a chance to assess 
what steps the district has already taken and look at what officials should do 
next. The public can watch the presentation tonight at 7:30 on cable television 
Channel 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth violence has been a key issue in Irvine. A committee made up of city and 
school officials delivered a comprehensive report on the subject last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safe Community Task Force made more than 50 recommendations for reducing 
youth violence. School officials have already begun implementing some 
suggestions, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hiring school safety officers for high schools and middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increasing the use of "conflict management" training to prevent physical 
confrontations among students. These nonviolent conflict resolution techniques 
rely in part on students who help other students work out their differences 
without fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increasing the use of ethics curricula in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Margie Wakeham praised the district's efforts for going beyond 
simple security measures and attempting to change the way students look at 
conflict and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 She praised the conflict management programs for helping students "look 
clearly at the issues (involved in a dispute) and find ways to resolve 
conflicts and (remain) friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics training such as the kind being taught to ninth-graders at Woodbridge 
High School is considered a model for other programs around the nation, Wakeham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just about the importance of being honest," she said. "It looks at 
things like tolerance and respecting other people's rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Wakeham said the district might consider placing intercoms or telephones into 
portable classrooms that currently don't have them. Teachers have suggested the 
idea as a way of maintaining instant two-way communications with other school 
officials. SHELBY GRAD

TOLLWAY NO THREAT TO BIRDS, NEW REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite heavy loss to gnatcatcher and cactus-wren habitat from October's 
devastating Laguna Beach fire, construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway 
won't jeopardize the long-term survival of the rare, environmentally threatened 
birds, federal wildlife officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-page biological opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
released Monday, could influence a federal judge whose injunction barring 
tollway construction in the Laguna Greenbelt area issued before the blaze comes 
up for review in March. 
</P>
<P>
 County tollway officials sent a copy of the opinion to U.S. District Judge 
Linda McLaughlin, who had recently asked lawyers in the case brought by 
environmentalists and other toll road opponents to address the fire's impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's opinion is consistent with an earlier finding by the Fish and 
Wildlife agency that the birds were in "no jeopardy" from the tollway 
construction. That earlier opinion was widely disputed by environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it might be assumed that most birds perished in the blaze, the 
results of surveys immediately following the fire . . . suggest otherwise," the 
latest report states. "The best scientific data available suggest the 
approximately 200 gnatcatchers and 190 pairs of coastal cactus wrens persist in 
unburned areas of the San Joaquin Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 The report did not state how many of the two species were lost to the fire, 
though it acknowledges that there were some 400 gnatcatchers before the fire in 
the entire area. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire's impacts are "temporary," the coastal sage scrub habitat crucial for 
survival of the birds "will recover," and the birds will eventually 
"recolonize" the burned area, the report adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway officials hailed the report because it keeps in place a biological 
opinion needed to proceed with construction. And they said they will continue 
to ask McLaughlin to lift the injunction, in part so that erosion control work 
can occur along the tollway path. 
</P>
<P>
 But tollway officials had also argued, ironically, that the injunction was no 
longer necessary because the fire-scorched area had little left to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the biological opinion released today is inconsistent with our 
arguments," tollway spokesman Mike Stockstill said. "We are still moving 
forward with our request to the judge."

HOPEFULS RUSH TO FILE FOR JUNE 7 PRIMARY; POLITICS: VACANT ASSEMBLY SEATS ARE 
BIG TARGETS. BUT DOZENS OF LOCAL OFFICES ALSO DRAW CANDIDATES' ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The mad dash to fill two Orange County state Assembly seats being vacated by 
incumbents got off to a quick start Monday, as would-be candidates for those 
seats and dozens of other local offices began taking out papers for the June 7 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 For Republicans, who make up about 52% of the county's voters, the start of 
the 1994 election season carries with it the hope of taking away from the 
Democrats the only legislative seat they now hold -- the 69th District seat now 
held by Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove, who is planning a run for state 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats, meanwhile, are hoping to break through the Republican dominance 
by targeting two outspoken congressmen, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). Democrats outnumber Republicans 
in Dornan's district, but they represent only 34% of all Orange County voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two city council members -- Irvine's Barry J. Hammond and Santa Ana's Ted R. 
Moreno -- registered their intent to run for the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 While usually having little impact in the local races, the Libertarian Party 
on Monday demonstrated its continuing campaign to appear on the ballot, with 
seven candidates among the first to take out papers for races ranging from the 
U.S. Senate seat now held by Democrat Dianne Feinstein to congressional and 
state legislative seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Between now and Feb. 9, candidates for Congress, the state Legislature, and 
the county's judicial seats must file declarations of intent to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's June 7 primary ballot also will include the Board of Supervisors 
races in the 2nd, 4th and 5th districts, election of other county officials, 
including the district attorney, sheriff-coroner and the superintendent of 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates for those nonpartisan offices will begin filing their nomination 
papers on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Republicans are focusing on maintaining their grip on local 
legislative seats, most of the interest in recent days has centered in the 70th 
Assembly District, where the incumbent, Republican Gil Ferguson of Newport 
Beach, announced Friday that he would not seek reelection in order to run for 
the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's departure from the Assembly is likely to create an intra-party 
clash. Among the first Republicans to express interest in Ferguson's seat were: 
Irvine Councilman Hammond; Bruce E. Peotter, a Newport Beach lawyer; and Thomas 
G. Reinecke, an attorney and the son of a former California lieutenant 
governor. Several other prominent Republicans have been mentioned as possible 
candidates for Ferguson's 70th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Party activist and Irvine lawyer Jim Toledano also declared his 
candidacy Monday for Ferguson's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one Republican, perennial candidate Virgel L. Nickell, had signed up as 
of Monday for the Assembly seat now held by Umberg, even though capturing that 
seat is a major goal of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The state legislative and congressional districts in central Orange County, 
which have large Latino and Asian American populations, are high on the 
Democrats' list of targeted races. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's expected departure from the Assembly has left Democrats bracing for 
their own intramural battle. As of Monday, four Democrats had declared their 
intent to run in the 69th District: Zeke Hernandez, a Santa Ana resident and 
Latino political activist; Santa Ana Councilman Moreno; Santa Ana resident 
Wayman L. Nelson; and Enriqueta L. Ramos, a Rancho Santiago Community College 
District board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that we do have some work to do since we don't have (Umberg) 
running in that spot," local Democratic Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia said. 
"It sure would have made my life easier had he maintained that seat." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Democrats try to hold on to Umberg's seat, they also will target other 
districts with high Democratic registration numbers, including Dornan's 46th 
Congressional District. Four Democrats have declared their candidacies so far, 
as well as one Republican and one Libertarian.

HIGH COURT DENIES INSURANCE PAYOUT IN OVERDOSE; LAW: STATE JURISTS SAY FAMILY 
CANNOT COLLECT ON A PORTION OF COVERAGE BECAUSE MAN COULD HAVE EXPECTED 
PROBLEMS FROM COCAINE USE. THE RULING DRAWS A FINE LINE FOR DEATHS CAUSED BY 
'ACCIDENTAL MEANS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court held Monday that the Orange County survivors of a 
man who voluntarily ingested cocaine and died of an overdose cannot collect 
life insurance benefits intended to cover deaths by "accidental means." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 5-2 decision, the court said that the death was not caused by "accidental 
means" because the deceased could have reasonably anticipated that death or 
great bodily injury would occur from ingesting a hazardous, illegal drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling leaves California in the minority of states that distinguish 
insurance coverage for accidental death from death caused by "accidental 
means." Under the latter definition, a fatality that results from an 
intentional action that could lead to death would not be covered, according to 
one of the attorneys on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Courts around the country have abolished the distinction because it is a 
distinction without meaning," said Santa Ana attorney Richard A. Cohn. "To 
uphold the distinction simply allows the Supreme Court to choose when and where 
it wants to draw the line. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The case was brought by the Santa Ana mother and sister of Michael P. Weil, 
who died at 32 of a cocaine overdose. Weil, an engineer in the semiconductor 
industry, was in San Francisco on business in 1985 and was staying at one of 
the city's most elegant hotels when he ingested enough cocaine to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Kemper Life Assurance Company paid his mother and sister, Lola Brown 
Weil and Michelle Weil of Santa Ana, $100,000 as beneficiaries of the life 
insurance policy but refused to allow them to collect another $100,000 under an 
accidental death rider in the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial court and a Court of Appeal ruled against the insurance company, which 
appealed the case to the state's high court. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . It is clear," said Justice Ronald George, writing for the majority, 
"that California cases in a variety of factual settings have interpreted 
policies affording coverage for death effected through accidental means to 
preclude coverage for voluntary and intentional conduct that results in 
unintended death." 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Stanley Mosk and Joyce Kennard, the most moderate members of the 
conservative court, dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that the survivors are entitled to collect under the policy 
because the overdose was accidental. "In all cases in which the insured's act 
was more than negligent but not tantamount to suicide," Mosk wrote, "the 
insured can reasonably expect to be covered."

RESIDENTS OF SHANTYTOWN LOOKING FOR NEW HOMES; DISPUTE: ABOUT 40 PEOPLE SAY 
THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO LEAVE THE MIGRANT CAMP CALLED PORTERVILLE BECAUSE OF A 
LAND FEUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caught in the middle of a protracted land dispute between their landlord and 
neighboring homeowners, the 40 or so people living in a migrant camp known as 
Porterville said Monday they are seeking homes elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Luis Ocampo, spokesman for the shantytown community, said the tenants 
have received a 15-day notice from landlord Sam Porter and "everyone here is 
looking for a place out there, and some are already moving out." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Trabuco Highlands Community Assn., court order in hand, locked 
a gate that seals off Porterville from its only access road. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the only way for the tenants to get out of the camp was either by 
walking more than a mile along a dry creek bed or through the gate -- but only 
if they had all their belongings packed in their vehicles, never to be let back 
in again, Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in July, 1992, Porter and the William Lyon Co., developer of the Trabuco 
Highlands subdivision, signed an agreement that gave the homeowners association 
the right to build the gate at the entrance to Porterville, which lies at the 
foot of the Saddleback Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement allowed Porter and his immediate family to have keys to the 
gate, and Porter was allowed to have guests in his 233-acre ranch for up to 
seven days, said homeowners association spokesman Don Chadd.  
</P>
<P>
 However, said Chadd, the agreement did not contemplate the use of the gate by 
Porter's tenants, who pay about $50 a month each to live in dilapidated 
trailers, campers and cabins. Chadd said the traffic and noise generated by the 
tenants in the streets of Trabuco Highlands forced the association to take a 
tough stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an obligation to the people we represent to find a solution to the 
problem," Chadd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter on Monday alleged the entire matter stems from racism. He said his 
tenants are allowed to work in nurseries nearby but not to live next to those 
they work for. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's "views and determinations are racially motivated," he said. 
"These people are being victimized and exploited. If anyone ever asks if racism 
exists in Orange County, let them look to Porterville." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chadd said nothing could be further from the truth. Porter, he said, was 
"grasping at straws" and not taking responsibility for his own actions. He said 
Porter created the problem by disobeying county zoning and health regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has tried to dismantle Porterville over the years, citing numerous 
fire, safety and health code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation, Chadd said, "is unfortunate but unavoidable. My heart goes out 
to these people." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ocampo, the shantytown spokesman: "The only way out is to get out of 
here, so we're out of here."

DAMAGE TO COLISEUM CLOUDS FOOTBALL SEASON; QUAKE: SOME FEAR STADIUM MAY HAVE TO 
BE TORN DOWN. A REPORT ON ITS STATUS IS EXPECTED IN TWO WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Earthquake damage to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is so extensive that 
the historic stadium might not be repaired in time for next fall's football 
season, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 One Coliseum aide said that a structural engineer's report is pending, but 
there is a possibility it might have to be demolished and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the officials now believe that the costs of reopening the 
stadium could vastly exceed the estimate of $35 million made last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials have not foreclosed the possibility of repairing and 
reopening the facility -- which was red-tagged Sunday by city building 
inspectors -- in time for the next football season, but they concede that time 
is short, and that work is contingent on a quick decision by federal 
authorities to assume most of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Monday that 
consideration of Coliseum aid could take time, and added that 
earthquake-damaged schools would have a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the Coliseum's future were reports Monday in Eastern publications 
that the Raiders have been exploring a move from Los Angeles to either Hartford 
or Baltimore. Attendance at Raiders games in the recently completed season was 
often disappointing even though the stadium was renovated to make it more 
suitable for viewing football. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to bring an NFL franchise back to Baltimore, officials in Maryland have 
courted the Rams as well as the Raiders. Members of the Maryland Stadium 
Authority met in New York City on Jan. 20 with John Shaw, Rams executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw was asked to provide "a letter of interest" to satisfy local politicians 
that the Rams were seriously considering a move from Anaheim Stadium. But a 
source close to the Rams said it was unlikely that the club would provide the 
letter because it might limit the team's negotiating position as they consider 
whether to leave Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams notified the city of Anaheim last month of their intention to invoke 
the escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium lease, but not until May 3. Under 
terms of the clause, the Rams would have to remain a tenant of the stadium for 
15 months, or through the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the announcement, the Rams became a target for not only Baltimore, but a 
number of other cities who are anxious to attract an NFL team such as St. 
Louis; Memphis, Tenn.; Hartford, Ct.; Sacramento and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles officials continued assessing the earthquake damage at 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 During a tour of the stadium Monday, Don C. Webb, the Coliseum Commission's 
project director for recent renovations of the facility, said a fairly complete 
report from structural engineers is expected in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A (crack) runs through the concourse, through the tunnels and into the base 
of the foundation," Webb said. "What we don't see is extremely important. The 
question is whether this (facility) can be fixed, or whether it will have to be 
demolished." 
</P>
<P>
 But the principal structural engineer retained to assess the damage said he 
believes that demolition will not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahih Youssef said, "Technically, the Coliseum still has capacity to withstand 
earthquakes. There is a lot of damage, but it is not all to the lateral 
earthquake resistance system of the building. There is some residual strength 
and we can build on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a separation of the outer Coliseum wall from the superstructure," 
Youssef said. "The outer structure was displaced differently from the inner 
side, where the seating is located. . . . But the structural integrity may not 
have been fatally compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Youssef said, Saturday's magnitude 5.0 aftershock caused 
additional damage at the Coliseum, and the $35-million estimate of damage made 
last week is too low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Repairs will take six months to a year," once they begin, Youssef said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, who also toured the facility and has 
an engineering degree, said he believes the lower levels of the Coliseum are on 
"solid ground" and that most of the damage is confined to the "higher tier" at 
the concourse, or upper concessions and restroom level, and above. 
</P>
<P>
 "The higher tier will have to be taken down and replaced," he said. "It's 
going to be very expensive. But I think repairs are feasible, and we are 
applying to FEMA for funding." 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming Coliseum Commission president, County Supervisors Chairwoman 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, said she had been informed "it would not necessarily 
be required to remove the entire upper tier." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum has no earthquake insurance, officials said, and no appreciable 
funds in reserve for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Hagerman, the Coliseum's general manager who was present for Monday's 
tour, declared that everything is contingent on what the structural engineer 
reports about the severity of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tour drew to a close, Webb, Hagerman and Margaret Farnum, executive 
secretary to the Coliseum Commission, noticed for the first time that the Los 
Angeles Department of Building and Safety had red-tagged the Coliseum. A sign 
posted on the outer fence at the peristyle end declared that it was unsafe to 
enter. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign said it had been posted at 11:30 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the city's chief building inspector, Russell Lane, said he took a team 
to the Coliseum on Sunday, but they were unable to enter the locked facility. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the judgment had been made to red tag the building based on cracks 
visible from the outside, and that city inspectors had yet to observe the 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the principal damage displayed Monday by Webb and Hagerman was a deep 
crack running the entire length of the upper level concourse, which the two 
officials said showed how the Coliseum's outer wall had separated from the 
inner seating structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaps could be seen between sections of seating, and chunks of fallen concrete 
littered parts of the concourse. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the lower part of the stadium seating, built in the early 1920s, 
had sunk away several inches from the upper section, which was added for the 
1932 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also serious cracking of some pillars and beams in the Peristyle end 
of the stadium -- the only facility in the world to have hosted two of the 
modern Olympic Games, and the site of a World Series and many important 
political and entertainment events. 
</P>
<P>
 "One problem we have is that different parts of the stadium moved in different 
directions," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Hamlin, a spokesman for FEMA, stressed that fast action is necessary if 
there is to be any chance of getting the facility ready for next fall's 
football games by the Los Angeles Raiders professional franchise and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 A USC spokesman said Monday the school will await the engineer's report before 
commenting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders did not return calls for comment.

QUAKE UPENDS SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN REAL ESTATE; HOUSING: WITH 30,000 DISPLACED, 
NEW RENTERS ABOUND. WHILE SOME HOME SHOPPERS RETREAT, OPPORTUNISTS RUSH IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake that turned so many lives upside-down has also upended 
supply and demand in the Los Angeles-area housing market, bringing unlikely 
relief to many long-suffering property owners but only renewed grief to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and landlords whose wallets have been thinning for months because 
they were not able to sell their vacant houses or rent empty apartments say 
that they are now besieged by tenants displaced by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, buyers who want to avoid Northridge and other communities at the 
quake's epicenter are spilling over into surrounding areas, creating a 
mini-sales boom from Woodland Hills to Agoura on the west and across the San 
Gabriel Valley in the east, real estate agents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many home shoppers have retreated to the sidelines while the ground 
continues to shake from aftershocks. Hundreds of home sales are in limbo 
because lenders are insisting that properties be reinspected for damage.

<P>
 Yet some opportunists have rushed in, hoping to pick up a bargain in a housing 
market that only recently had emerged from a prolonged and severe recession. 
Harried salespeople and lenders are working overtime, helping the new clients 
while trying to salvage the deals already in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like trying to navigate through the Bermuda Triangle," said Jamie 
Ramstead, a Northridge real estate agent trying to save the six sales he has in 
escrow while also repairing $60,000 in damage to his home. "Most of us have 
never been through something like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake rendered more than 15,000 homes and apartments unlivable, throwing 
more than 30,000 people onto streets from Santa Monica to Simi Valley, 
according to city agencies and disaster relief officials. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many families looking for new places to live, sellers who have lost 
thousands of dollars while their vacant homes sat unsold in a depressed market 
have been flooded with calls from prospective renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Kennedy has been making the $950-a-month mortgage payment on her home in 
Canoga Park that she vacated in July after finding a new job in Oregon. The 
house sustained little damage from the quake, so she flew back to Los Angeles 
last week and leased it to a displaced Northridge family for $1,850 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure I'll recoup what I've lost by the summer, and then I'll be making 
good money because the family signed a one-year lease," said Kennedy, who 
reviews contracts for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for all those people who lost their homes, but it's nice to 
finally make something off this house. The last six months have bled me dry." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has also been a boon for sellers in many San Fernando Valley 
communities that were spared the most serious damage. Thus, some would-be 
buyers are steering clear of hard-hit Northridge and Reseda in favor of nearby 
Woodland Hills and north into southern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Bolin, sales manager of the Coldwell Banker real estate office in 
Woodland Hills, said his agents sold half a dozen properties over the weekend 
-- even though many buyers stayed home to watch the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the quake, we'd be happy with just three or four sales," Bolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many put their home-buying plans on ice after the quake hit, some new 
buyers have moved in to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Lipson, vice president of an executive search firm, lost her 
$535-a-month rent-controlled Santa Monica apartment in the quake. Because it 
would cost her twice that for a comparable apartment, she wants to buy a 
condominium, hoping her mortgage interest deductions will keep her housing 
expenses at a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good deals on the Westside right now," Lipson said. As a 
bonus, she added, "it's a little easier to tell which buildings are well-built. 
Some of them have just fallen apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not all of those new buyers are being welcomed by real estate agents or 
their sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Lamb, co-owner of Century 21 Lamb Realty in Northridge, said she and 
her staff have gotten several calls from investors hoping to pick up homes at a 
tiny fraction of their normal prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten our share of bottom-feeders, but they're not having much 
success," said Lamb, whose home sustained major damage during the quake. "The 
law says that we have to present their offers to our sellers, but there's 
nothing that says we have to like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many buyers and sellers who were waiting for escrow to close when the quake 
hit are in limbo. About 1,000 deals were pending in the San Fernando Valley 
when the earthquake struck, according to the local realtors association. A few 
hundred were in escrow in Santa Monica and adjacent communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lenders are requiring that every house they had agreed to finance in the 
county be reinspected for damage. As a result, some appraisers and inspectors 
have been busy taking a second look at properties more than 75 miles from the 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house I'm buying in Sherman Oaks didn't get hurt a bit, but I can't close 
the deal because my (appraiser) is busy looking at houses down in Long Beach," 
said Nick Smith, who drives a delivery truck. "The whole thing is stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 An informal poll of about a dozen real estate offices in the San Fernando 
Valley and on the Westside found that about 10% of all purchases in escrow at 
the time of the earthquake have been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our customers are going through with their sales, although we've had 
to renegotiate some of the terms," Lamb said. "It takes a little extra work for 
us and might add a few days of delays, but nobody has called up in a panic and 
said they want their money back." 
</P>
<P>
 Those words are of little comfort to Rhoark Rollband in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollband had been trying to sell his condominium for nearly a year before the 
earthquake hit, and had reduced the asking price for his two-bedroom loft to 
$124,000 from $129,000. The local housing market was showing signs of picking 
up, and he was confident the home would sell soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rollband's unit weathered the quake, the temblor damaged several 
other buildings at the sprawling complex on White Oak Avenue and knocked out 
gas service for nearly two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has slashed his price again -- this time to $109,000 -- and is willing 
to take even less to make a quick sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meet my price, and I'll even throw in my furniture," said Rollband, a 
salesman who says the quake persuaded him that it is time to move to Denver. "I 
just want to cut my losses and get out of L.A. as fast as I can."

ILLICIT DRUG USE BY YOUTHS SHOWS MARKED INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Illicit drug use by teen-agers increased significantly between 1992 and 1993, 
driven by a dramatic rise in the use of marijuana and more use of stimulants, 
LSD and inhalants, federal officials announced Monday, noting that the trend 
reverses the downward patterns seen in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "These findings are more than a warning signal," Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna E. Shalala said at a press conference to announce the results 
of the annual survey of nearly 50,000 8th-, 10th- and 12th-grade students. 
"They are an urgent alarm we must heed at once." 
</P>
<P>
 To convey the growing sense of urgency, three Cabinet officers -- Shalala, 
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley and White House Office of Drug Control 
Policy Director Lee P. Brown -- announced the results of the annual survey 
together, pledging to step up efforts to alter the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 While similar studies for Orange County teen-agers are not complete, officials 
on Monday said that local drug use appears to be stabilizing, with no 
significant trend shifts in the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Fair, a manager with the Orange County Health Care Agency, said that 
among those teens seeking treatment, the drug used most often is marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting a trend in the general population, youths in treatment have shown 
increased use of LSD, according to Fair. But counselors also have noticed a 
drop in the use of cocaine and of several drugs at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Shalala said she plans to contact the presidents of broadcast 
networks, film studios, record companies and professional sports leagues to 
urge them "to rededicate themselves to getting the message out about 
prevention." Brown said he will convene a national meeting of experts in 
prevention and drug education to confront the problem of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drug use among American young people has been making a clear comeback in the 
past two years," said Lloyd Johnston, the University of Michigan research 
scientist who conducted the survey, adding that the nation had "been lulled 
into a false sense of security" by declining numbers in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Bennett, who first headed the drug policy office during the George 
Bush Administration, immediately blamed the Clinton Administration for the 
increases. "Although we still have a serious drug problem in America, the 
Clinton Administration has been nearly invisible on the drug issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration's most prominent voice on drugs," Bennett said, "has been 
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and her favorable words about drug 
legalization." He was referring to Elders' suggestion that the issue of drug 
legalization should be studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
said the new pattern "emphasizes the need for immediate action in fighting both 
drugs and crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The increases "are in part the result of an erosion of anti-drug attitudes by 
youth," said Richard A. Millstein, acting director of the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse. "Now more than ever, we need to counter erroneous messages that 
glamorize the use of illicit drugs, alcohol and cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings cut across all socioeconomic levels and showed that "contrary to 
conventional wisdom," black students reported the lowest rates of use for 
virtually all drugs, Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey, which has been sponsored annually since 1975 by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, the percentage of high school seniors who 
reported using an illicit drug at least once in their lives increased from 
40.7% in 1992 to 42.9% in 1993 but still remained well below the peak level of 
65.6% recorded in 1981, the report said. Nevertheless, the 1993 increase 
reverses a downward trend of use by 12th-graders that began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of any illicit drug in the past year by high school seniors increased from 
27.1% in 1992 to 31% in 1993 after steadily declining from a peak of 54.2% in 
1979. Those seniors who said they had used an illicit drug within the last 
month increased from 14.4% in 1992 to 18.3% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of marijuana increased by three or four percentage points during the 
last two years among 8th-, 10th- and 12th-graders, according to Johnston. In 
1993, the proportion of students reporting marijuana use in the previous year 
was 9% for 8th-graders, 19% for 10th-graders and 26% for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put another way, the proportion of 8th-graders using marijuana has increased 
by half in the last two years, while the proportion of 10th-grade users 
increased by about a quarter and the proportion of 12th-grade users by about a 
fifth," Johnston said. Although the rates are well below the peak levels 
reached in the late 1970s, "they clearly represent a reversal of the declines 
we recorded for more than a decade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also showed that legal drugs -- alcohol and cigarettes -- still are 
the most widely used among the nation's youth at all grade levels. Two-thirds 
of eighth-graders and nearly nine-tenths of seniors have tried alcohol, the 
report said.

OASIS FOR ABANDONED CHILDREN IN TIJUANA; HAVEN: LAGUNA BEACH ENVIRONMENTALIST 
HELPS TURN BARREN REFUGE INTO A GARDEN FOR YOUNGSTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just south of the international border lies an improbable oasis for abandoned 
children. In this six-acre haven are redolent edible gardens teeming with mint, 
rosemary, cilantro, cauliflower and mango and orange trees, among other flora. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty and aroma clash absurdly with the horrid smell of burning refuse 
rising from the shantytown just below, a barren place that a travel-weary 
Mother Teresa once stated had poverty "I have never seen anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aldeas Infantiles shelter, one of the few green spots in this parched city 
of about 2 million people, is partly the creation of a True Believer, Bill 
Roley of Laguna Beach. He is an anthropologist, horticulturist and all-around 
ecologically and environmentally correct dynamo who prizes compost as much as 
he does the looks and life-giving quality of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In this "museum of food," as Roley calls the shelter, he has turned loose his 
imagination, considerable green-thumb knowledge, and academic experience to 
create what he hopes is a living model for a city beset by poverty and 
overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Roley, the 46-year-old son of a Marine Corps colonel, is teaching the 
shelter's 22 children to become self-sufficient, to recycle nearly everything, 
and to teach others the value of seeds and soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is that they're responsible for the waste that comes out of their 
house and their kitchen; that they need to recycle it into compost," he said. 
"They're responsible for the chores around the kitchen, which has earth gardens 
that can be used (to grow) medicinal or culinary plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of a "ruptured society," as Roley described them, the children living 
at the shelter are the product of broken homes; of adolescent mothers or 
abusive parents who abandoned them or were forced to give them up. 
</P>
<P>
 And here, in the rows of romaine and baby lettuce, parsnips and peppers, is 
where Roley believes their recovery lies, where hope is nurtured and their 
futures are forged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to teach the children not only how to be emotionally strong, 
we're going to teach them how to be ecologically and environmentally strong," 
said Roley, who belongs to several ecological and educational organizations 
involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, he said, the gardens will yield enough produce that the children 
will be able to establish a small store to sell the excess to the public. He 
said the shelter, shaded and protected from the elements by its greenery, will 
be more self-sufficient and less dependent on outside food sources and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Pulido, president of the foundation that runs the shelter, said the 
experiment is opening eyes in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shelter is a reality that must be shown to be believed," he said. "Once 
it was nothing more than a barren hill with buildings where nothing could grow. 
Now it is a miracle, an example of how the methods applied can work here." 
</P>
<P>
 Roley earned his doctorate in anthropology at UC Irvine in 1976 and currently 
teaches environmental planning at Cal State Fullerton and ecological survival 
at the Center for Regenerative Studies at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Roley and his occasional business partner and ecological soul 
mate, Scott Murray, a landscaper and farmer who lives in northern San Diego 
County, were approached by the SOS Kinderdorf International Foundation. The 
organization -- which has created about 1,100 children's shelters throughout 
the world, including Tennessee and Louisiana -- asked Murray and Roley to help 
beautify a new shelter in Tijuana for a $25,000 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinderdorf wanted to use the ecological techniques developed by Roley and his 
Permaculture Institute of Southern California to design drainage channels, 
ecological landscaping and six more houses to complement the seven existing 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roley and Murray first arrived at the site, they knew the job was not 
going to be easy. The foundations of the two-story homes had been damaged by 
rain. Moreover, tons of construction debris had been dumped at the edge of the 
property, creating a porous slope upon which rain had carved five-foot-wide 
crevices, a clear sign of erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Americans also realized that the place, about a mile uphill from 
Tijuana's Central Bus Depot, was particularly vulnerable to the wind as well as 
the noise created by the heavy traffic moving toward Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the project turned into a labor of love for the two Americans. By 
their own account, their fee would, over the two years, work out to the 
equivalent of $1.50-an-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job mushroomed into a much larger job than we had committed to," Roley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, soon the two men found a few allies, including the Morelos State 
Park nursery and nurseries throughout Orange County, which donated several 
hundred trees. Tijuana's Caliente Racetrack donated several hundred tons of 
compost from its stalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Roley and Murray designed an intricate water harvesting system, reconditioned 
the soil, including the eroded slope, and planted citrus, olive, fig, banana, 
mango, palm and acacia trees, bougainvillea, vines and a myriad of edible and 
medicinal plants. 
</P>
<P>
 They also established contact with an organization creating an eco-park near 
the shelter using recently developed water-treatment techniques. These 
ultimately may be used to create a permanent source of water for the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they have helped create an environmental school at the site that 
is becoming a model for schools throughout the region, according to Roley and 
local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school is becoming a magnet for environmental awareness. The ecological 
classroom is seen as a model for some of the things (Tijuana residents) would 
like to do, things we have done here," Roley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who once ran a farm in Mexico that produced out-of-season fruits and 
vegetables for U.S. restaurants, said that he and Roley were simply drawing on 
old techniques that they believe should be adopted by the city of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the cutting edge of a 10,000-year-old technology," said Murray, who, 
during his college days at UC Santa Cruz back in the early 1970s, was one of 
the first to promote the idea of agro-ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the pioneers of the sustainable future where things don't get 
progressively worse, they get better and better," he said. "We've tried to 
build something here that 20 years from now will be financially sustainable. 
We've established a system that will get better and better." 
</P>
<P>
 Although 22 children are housed at the shelter, about 100 more are expected 
within the next couple of years, said shelter director Guillermo Arriaga. It 
all depends, it seems, on how fast the "dynamic duo," as Roley and Murray are 
called by their Mexican partners, can gather volunteers and donations to finish 
the rest of the buildings and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito Espinoza Montalbo, a 9-year-old boy whose short stature and slight 
build belies his age, is among the smallest helpers. During a recent visit by 
the San Diego-based People for Trees organization, Benito was the first to 
volunteer in the planting of several trees brought by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 His story is not unlike the others' here. Abandoned by abusive parents two 
years ago in the town of Tehuacan, Puebla, he and his sister Liliana, 13, were 
picked up by Kinderdorf's Aldeas Infantiles in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito said his parents "would beat us up with a cable (cord) or whatever 
else" they could find. He said he liked planting trees, the smell of the 
flowers he grows, and the good people who take care of him at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the boy cannot forget his mother. "I would like to see her again, grow 
a flower and give it to her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the Kinderdorf organization, created after World War II in Austria, 
is not only to raise single children, but also to keep siblings together in a 
family atmosphere, according to Arriaga. Children like Benito and Liliana will 
stay together in the shelter until they reach maturity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocio De Osuna, the wife of Mayor Hector Osuna Jaime and head of the city's 
family development agency, is impressed with the shelter and would like the see 
the same program started at the dozens of agency day care centers, 
kindergartens and orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a program of family gardens, but without all the variety offered by 
the Aldeas Infantiles shelter," she said. "I would really like to have 
something like that for us and I'm going to see to it that we do."

ADMINISTRATION TO ASK $2 BILLION MORE QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration will ask Congress today for about $2 billion more 
in federal earthquake relief than it had previously announced -- which would 
make the disaster-assistance package for the Northridge quake the costliest in 
U.S. history if approved, administration officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing still-rising damage estimates, a flood of relief applicants and the 
impact of serious aftershocks, the Administration is boosting its request for 
housing grants, small business loans and other federal aid to $8.6 billion. In 
addition, nearly $900 million in federal funds has already been committed to 
the quake-ravaged region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding more and more damage," Richard Krim, the associate director of 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told a House subcommittee Monday. "You 
look at a building, it looks OK from the outside, then you go in and start 
seeing cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 The President was to send the expanded aid proposal to Capitol Hill this 
morning. The House Appropriations Committee was scheduled to begin legislative 
consideration today. 
</P>
<P>
 The new request includes another $1.2 billion for FEMA, which coordinates 
government response to disasters and administers emergency aid. About 
two-thirds of the funds will be earmarked for housing assistance and social 
services for those whose homes were damaged or destroyed by the Jan. 17 
Northridge quake. Most of the remainder would be used to make schools and other 
public buildings less prone to damage in future earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $550 million will be added in Small Business Administration disaster 
assistance loans for businesses and homeowners, nearly doubling the $559 
million originally sought. 
</P>
<P>
 The aid bill will also include an increase of $50 million to $100 million in 
housing vouchers for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, nearly 
$50 million in new funds for the Veterans Administration to repair the damaged 
V.A. Medical Center in North Hills and $100 million for a presidential 
contingency fund to be spent on quake-related costs as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 With the additional funds, the quake relief measure would surpass record sums 
spent by the federal government on other large-scale disasters. A total of $8.5 
billion has been spent on a joint aid package to repair damage caused by 
Hurricanes Andrew in Florida and Iniki in Hawaii and Typhoon Omar in Guam, all 
of which struck in 1992. About $4.7 billion has been channeled to the 
Midwestern communities devastated by last year's floods. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude 6.6 pre-dawn temblor killed at least 57 people and inflicted 
extensive damage on homes, freeways, businesses and public structures. A 5.0 
aftershock on Jan. 29 caused further losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the country fails to realize that not only was this a severe 
earthquake but it was right in the middle of a major urbanized area," said a 
senior Administration official. "The damage to homes is largely uninsured and 
the damage to infrastructure far exceeds what one would expect from a 
hurricane." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that, while the increased aid package may raise objections from 
some lawmakers, the Administration remains hopeful that the emergency 
assistance bill will still command broad support. 
</P>
<P>
 "If members of Congress study the justifications we provide, there should be 
no serious problem," the senior aide said. "People generally seem to respect 
the principle of treating these victims the way we've treated victims of 
previous disasters." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has received more than 215,000 requests for housing and 
other individual assistance at disaster centers throughout the earthquake area 
and projections indicate that figure could go as high as 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration reports that it is receiving 1,000 
applications daily and expects the tally to exceed 200,000. In comparison, the 
agency received 110,000 applications in the wake of Hurricane Andrew and 90,000 
after the floods. 
</P>
<P>
 The official did not rule out future aid but said that the latest figures 
include "both the damage we know and our projections of what we may discover. 
The aftershocks make it a moving target." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said that the larger aid package indicates 
that the Administration is demonstrating "good faith" in its vow to seek more 
funds if more damage is documented. She said that the total could yet rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the numbers justify it, it will go higher," she predicted. "The numbers 
seem to be documenting these increases." 
</P>
<P>
 The full House is expected to consider the earthquake bill Thursday. Senate 
action will follow. Proponents aim to have the measure on President Clinton's 
desk by the time Congress adjourns for a week on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake relief proposal is not expected to prompt significant 
opposition, said Administration and congressional sources. Rather, the biggest 
battles are expected over conservative efforts to force budget cuts elsewhere 
to pay for assistance and initiatives to prohibit aid from going to illegal 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) said Monday that the lawmaker plans 
to introduce an amendment to the relief package today that would restrict funds 
in the bill to citizens and legal residents of the United States. She said this 
would apply to direct assistance, such as SBA loans or housing vouchers, but 
would exclude emergency medical care or food. 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels that by reimbursing these people, we're rewarding illegal behavior," 
the aide said. She added that Packard plans to introduce similar amendments to 
every spending measure that Congress considers this year.

ILLICIT DRUG USE BY YOUTHS SHOWS MARKED INCREASE 
</P>

 Illicit drug use by teen-agers increased significantly between 1992 and 1993, 
driven by a dramatic rise in the use of marijuana and more use of stimulants, 
LSD and inhalants, federal officials announced Monday, noting that the trend 
reverses the downward patterns seen in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "These findings are more than a warning signal," Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna E. Shalala said at a press conference to announce the results 
of the annual survey of nearly 50,000 8th-, 10th- and 12th-grade students. 
"They are an urgent alarm we must heed at once." 
</P>
<P>
 To convey the growing sense of urgency, three Cabinet officers -- Shalala, 
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley and White House Office of Drug Control 
Policy Director Lee P. Brown -- announced the results of the annual survey 
together, pledging to step up efforts to alter the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala said she plans to contact the presidents of broadcast networks, film 
studios, record companies and professional sports leagues to urge them "to 
rededicate themselves to getting the message out about prevention." Brown said 
he will convene a national meeting of experts in prevention and drug education 
to confront the problem of drug abuse by young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drug use among American young people has been making a clear comeback in the 
past two years," said Lloyd Johnston, the University of Michigan research 
scientist who conducted the survey, adding that the nation had "been lulled 
into a false sense of security" by declining numbers in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Bennett, who first headed the drug policy office during the George 
Bush Administration, immediately blamed the Clinton Administration for the 
increases. "Although we still have a serious drug problem in America, the 
Clinton Administration has been nearly invisible on the drug issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration's most prominent voice on drugs," Bennett said, "has been 
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and her favorable words about drug 
legalization." He was referring to Elders' suggestion that the issue of drug 
legalization should be studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
said the new pattern "is a disturbing finding and emphasizes the need for 
immediate action in fighting both drugs and crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The increases "are in part the result of an erosion of anti-drug attitudes by 
youth," said Richard A. Millstein, acting director of the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse. "Now more than ever, we need to counter erroneous messages that 
glamorize the use of illicit drugs, alcohol and cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings cut across all socioeconomic levels and showed that "contrary to 
conventional wisdom," black students reported the lowest rates of use for 
virtually all drugs, Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey, which has been sponsored annually since 1975 by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, the percentage of high school seniors who 
reported using an illicit drug at least once in their lives increased from 
40.7% in 1992 to 42.9% in 1993 but still remained well below the peak level of 
65.6% recorded in 1981, the report said. Nevertheless, the 1993 increase 
reverses a downward trend of use by 12th-graders that began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of any illicit drug in the past year by high school seniors increased from 
27.1% in 1992 to 31% in 1993 after steadily declining from a peak of 54.2% in 
1979. Those seniors who said they had used an illicit drug within the last 
month increased from 14.4% in 1992 to 18.3% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of marijuana increased by three or four percentage points during the 
last two years among 8th-, 10th- and 12th-graders, according to Johnston. In 
1993, the proportion of students reporting marijuana use in the previous year 
was 9% for 8th-graders, 19% for 10th-graders and 26% for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put another way, the proportion of 8th-graders using marijuana has increased 
by half in the last two years, while the proportion of 10th-grade users 
increased by about a quarter and the proportion of 12th-grade users by about a 
fifth," Johnston said. Although the rates are well below the peak levels 
reached in the late 1970s, "they clearly represent a reversal of the declines 
we recorded for more than a decade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also showed that legal drugs -- alcohol and cigarettes -- still are 
the most widely used among the nation's youth at all grade levels. Two-thirds 
of eighth-graders and nearly nine-tenths of seniors have tried alcohol, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, "episodes of heavy drinking are also common," Johnston said, 
reporting that 14% of 8th-graders, 23% of 10th-graders and 28% of seniors said 
that they had consumed five or more drinks in a row on at least one occasion 
during the two weeks before the survey was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking rates for high school seniors, which generally had been steady for 
nearly a decade, "are now on the increase," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate of daily smoking rose in all grade levels in 1993, from 7% to 8% 
among eighth-graders.

GREENSPAN SIGNALS INTEREST RATE HIKE; ECONOMY: CENTRAL BANK MAY HAVE TO RAISE 
BORROWING COSTS TO PREVENT A NEW SPURT IN INFLATION, FED CHIEF WARNS. ACTION IS 
NOT EXPECTED UNTIL MARCH AT EARLIEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Congress Monday that his 
agency may have to raise interest rates to prevent the economic recovery from 
triggering a new spurt of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the current short-term rates -- less than 3% for three-month 
Treasury bills -- as "abnormally low," he said that, unless there is an 
"unexpected and prolonged weakening of economic activity, we will need to move 
them to a more neutral stance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, which is scheduled to meet 
Thursday and Friday, must consider "when is the appropriate time to move to a 
somewhat less accommodative level of short-term interest rates," Greenspan said 
in testimony before Congress' Joint Economics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Fed will have to decide how long to "continue monetary 
accommodation without sowing the seeds of another bout of inflationary 
instability accompanied by steeply rising long-term rates." However, action on 
interest rates is not expected by economists until March at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, responding to Greenspan's remarks, told reporters at the 
White House later Monday that he hoped any increase in short-term rates would 
not be followed by an increase in long-term rates, "because there's no need to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've still got good, strong growth in this economy," he said. "But we want 
to manage it with real discipline; that is, we don't want to have one of these 
roller-coaster things. We want the economy to grow in a very stable, solid way 
and, obviously, low interest rates are critical to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made it clear that he expects cooperation in the effort to hold down 
both inflation and interest rates: 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider that part of the kind of compact that we've all made where we'll 
continue to reduce the deficit, and we've got to keep inflation down and 
interest rates down so that people can afford to borrow money and invest." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's comments were couched in the customary cautious language that 
members of the Federal Reserve Board use when addressing the sensitive issue of 
interest rates. But they nevertheless signaled a readiness to move toward 
higher interest rates, as well as a heightened concern that the economic muscle 
being exercised throughout much of the nation -- struggling Southern California 
is the major exception -- must be watched carefully so that growth is not 
allowed to ignite inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve chairman and other economists emphasized the need to shift 
from longstanding policy and strike preemptively against inflation because, 
once prices begin to rise, the dramatic steps needed to bring them under 
control risk creating a recession. Taking action in advance of solid evidence 
that inflation is occurring, however, goes against conventional economic 
procedure, in which measures are put in place only after specific data 
indicates they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve's decisions have impact far beyond the financial 
instruments it controls -- its own short-term loans to commercial banks, for 
example. Other short-term rates usually follow the Fed's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher rates make it more expensive for businesses to borrow and expand; they 
put a leash on inflation, but also on the creation of jobs by retarding overall 
economic activity. On the consumer level, increases imposed by the Federal 
Reserve eventually can translate into higher rates for auto loans and 
adjustable-rate mortgages, as well as for bank deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 More generally, statements by Federal Reserve officials are so widely 
respected that they tend to become self-fulfilling prophecies. A forecast of 
good times ahead, for example, can send Americans scurrying to make just the 
kinds of investments that promote economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funds rate, the rate charged for overnight loans among banks, hit 
a peak of 9.75% in 1989. The rate has held steady since September, 1992, when 
it fell to a nearly 30-year low of 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he said that "the foundations of the economic expansion are looking 
increasingly well-entrenched," Greenspan said that the expansion has been 
uneven and that weakness abroad has restrained U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, accelerating domestic economic activity "has put some upward 
pressure on prices." 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time inflation pressures are evident, many imbalances that are costly 
to rectify have already developed and only harsh monetary therapy can restore 
the financial stability necessary to sustain growth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation in 1993 was 2.7%, the lowest rate since 1965, with the exception of 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's comments coincided with a high-flying day on Wall Street, during 
which the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.93 points, to close at a record 
high of 3,978.36. At the same time, the bond market was mixed, with traders 
largely discounting the prediction of higher interest rates because anxious 
investors already had anticipated such increases. 
</P>
<P>
 During Monday's hearing, Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the Joint 
Economic Committee, urged Greenspan to delay as much as possible imposing any 
increase in interest rates, "given the limited number of indicators that 
inflation is around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Bros. in New York, praised efforts to 
take action in advance of clear evidence that inflation is occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that any action before March is unlikely, because the next set of 
economic figures -- those for January -- would be skewed by the freezing 
temperatures in the East and the earthquake in California.

'THREE STRIKES' BILLS SWEEP STATE ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to the public's election year outrage over crime, the Assembly on 
Monday approved five "three strikes" measures aimed at locking up habitual 
criminals for life, and sent the bills to the Senate where one or more are 
likely to pass within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has endorsed the toughest measure, almost identical to the 
"three strikes and you're out" initiative that backers are trying to place on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly approved that measure, authored by Assemblymen Bill Jones 
(R-Fresno) and Jim Costa (D-Hanford), by a 59-10 vote. The other "three 
strikes" bills cleared the Assembly by margins of 64-2, 66-2, 64-1 and 63-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a similar bill could not get out of committee. But after several 
highly publicized crimes and the onset of the election year, legislators are 
acting with unusual haste to show their support for tough crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "The locomotive is moving pretty fast," Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa 
Clara), an opponent, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) said he expects that the upper house will 
pass "a very strong version" of the "three strikes" concept. Roberti, the 
incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the bills will reach 
the committee next week. But he also suggested that the Senate may meld the 
measures into a single bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The action comes even though the cost of the measures remains unknown. 
Wilson's Department of Finance completed a preliminary cost analysis of the 
Jones-Costa bill but has not released it. The California Department of 
Corrections is working on a more detailed analysis. The legislative analyst has 
issued an early estimate that the Jones-Costa bill would cost billions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones scoffed at the cost arguments raised by the few opponents, pointing to 
the incalculable price of allowing violent criminals out of prison to commit 
more crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why can't we have zero tolerance for crime?" Jones demanded as he urged the 
lower house to approve his measure. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pointed to another number of more immediate concern to lawmakers -- a 
Field Poll that found 84% of voters in California support the "three strikes" 
initiative. It is an astonishingly high number given that the backers have not 
completed gathering enough signatures to place the initiative on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 An Assembly committee voted down the "three strikes" bill by Jones and Costa 
last year. But Assemblyman Bernie Richter (R-Chico) recalled the line about the 
definition of a conservative as being a liberal who has been mugged, and jabbed 
at the converts by saying: "The definition of a conservative is a bunch of 
liberals who have been reading public opinion polls." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jones-Costa bill focuses on criminals who commit a third felony, after 
having been convicted of two serious or violent felonies. A three-time loser 
would face either an indeterminate sentence of 25 years to life in prison with 
the possibility of parole, or three times the length of the sentence for the 
third crime, whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent felonies include murder, kidnaping, rape and armed robbery. Serious 
felonies, which are defined in the penal code, include furnishing drugs to a 
minor and residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Reynolds, the initiative's proponent, has endorsed the Jones-Costa bill, 
and said he will drop his initiative if the governor signs the bill into law. 
He began pushing the "three strikes and you're out" initiative after his 
daughter was murdered in 1992 by a repeat felon, and after the bill stalled in 
the Assembly last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three strikes bills are: 
</P>
<P>
 * A measure by Assemblyman Richard K. Rainey (R-Walnut Creek) to impose 
sentences of life in prison without parole for people who commit a third 
violent or serious felony. The vote was 62-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainey's bill, which focuses on violent offenders, is narrower than the 
Jones-Costa bill and would imprison fewer habitual criminals. Rainey's bill has 
the support of the California District Attorneys Assn., which helped draft it. 
</P>
<P>
 * A measure by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) to impose sentences of 
life in prison without parole for people who commit a third violent felony. His 
measure excludes several crimes that are in the Jones-Costa bill. The vote was 
66-2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two identical measures by Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia) to impose 
life without parole on anyone who commits a third violent felony. The votes 
were 64-1 and 63-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jones-Costa bill was approved despite a last-minute attempt by Assemblyman 
Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) to scuttle it by raising the ironic possibility that the 
bill -- and the initiative -- could abolish the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Both measures state that they do not affect the penal code section on special 
circumstances, which allows for either life in prison without parole or the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bates argued that the language is ambiguous on whether death could still 
be an option. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's written really poorly," Bates said. "At least they ought to know what 
they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Costa, both death penalty proponents, said they disagreed with 
Bates' analysis, but said they are considering amending the measure in the 
Senate to make it clear that the bill would not affect capital punishment. 
Amendments may be made to the bill moving through the Legislature, but not to 
the initiative.

CLASH IN MOGADISHU RAISES FEARS OF INCREASED VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Marines clashed with Somali civilians Monday in what some officials said 
could be a harbinger of the worst possible ending to the U.S. intervention in 
the East African country: the prospect of a series of last-minute attacks as 
American troops withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, came as U.S. forces began the 
final phase of their promised March 31 pullout. American officials said that 
the Marines fired only after they were fired on by Somali snipers, but Somali 
civilians said there was no such provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight Somalis died in the incident, and several were wounded. It was unclear 
whether the dead were gunmen or were unarmed. U.S. officials said they were 
investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, diplomats and military officials have been predicting that Somalia's 
long-feuding clan leaders -- including Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid -- will reach 
an interim political settlement, enabling the United States to meet the March 
31 deadline without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, officials here are sharply divided over the outlook for the 
next few weeks, with some worrying that the situation could deteriorate 
rapidly, eventually leading to a return of the devastating anarchy that 
prevailed before U.S. forces arrived in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one really knows -- it could go either way," said a senior U.S. diplomat 
who has been close to the situation. "We're watching it from day to day." 
</P>
<P>
 Incidents such as Monday's clearly are on the rise. Last week, Somali 
militiamen opened fire on a U.N. convoy, seriously wounding a Saudi soldier. 
And gangs of guerrillas went on a rampage in the central town of Belet Huen, 
looting a U.N. warehouse and forcing British relief workers to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 By planners' reckoning, the U.S. withdrawal, which began in early December, is 
right on schedule. About 3,100 of the 7,600 U.S. ground forces on duty in 
Somalia then -- mostly logistics troops and a few combat units -- have left. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-February, officials said, only about 2,500 U.S. ground troops will 
remain on Somali soil, and by March 31 the entire U.S. military contingent will 
be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington continues to bank on the notion that the warlords -- Aidid in 
particular -- will become convinced that launching any attacks between now and 
the U.S. departure date is not in their interest and could bring new 
destruction that might weaken them as leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Although headlines in the United States have focused on the 18 U.S. servicemen 
who were killed in an abortive Oct. 3 raid against Aidid, thousands of Somalis 
have died in clashes with U.N. forces in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials contended that many of Aidid's key lieutenants now recognize 
that and do not want to risk the possibility of hundreds more casualties among 
their own people. "The last thing they want to do is have a confrontation with 
the United States," one diplomat asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Monday's incident demonstrated, the possibility of continuing 
confrontations between departing U.S. troops and Somali militiamen is acute, 
and the prospect that the Somalis will "test" the U.N. forces that stay behind 
is even greater. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Clinton Administration, which previously appeared to 
underestimate the threat that the Somali militiamen posed, is taking extra 
precautions to protect the Americans' flanks as the last of the U.S. units pull 
out: 
</P>
<P>
 * Military officials said that the United States will keep enough combat 
forces -- as well as tanks and attack helicopters -- in Somalia to quell any 
major disturbances until the last U.S. units are ready to depart. 
</P>
<P>
 * The withdrawal will be gradual, with American troops closely covering the 
seaport and airport in Mogadishu -- the debarkation points for U.S. personnel 
and equipment -- right up until the end. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Pentagon also has ordered a second 2,200-man Marine expeditionary unit 
to join the one now stationed off the Somali coast through the final weeks of 
the withdrawal and first few days of U.N. occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 * And the United States and its allies have stationed additional warplanes at 
the sprawling U.S. base in Diego Garcia, a British island in the Indian Ocean, 
in case hostilities erupt. Also on tap are AC-130H gunships. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that how much of this arsenal will be needed is anyone's 
guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior U.S. diplomats are scheduled to meet with key clan leaders in Kenya 
this week to help hammer out a political settlement, amid what some consider to 
be optimistic signs that the outlines of an interim agreement may be within 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the talks with Western officials, Somali chieftains themselves have 
been negotiating behind the scenes, and diplomats said that both clan elders 
and religious leaders have begun talking about some sort of power-sharing 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
 The key question is over how to divide up the participation in any new 
government. "That's what they've been thrashing around in Nairobi," a U.S. 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, with U.S. prodding, the United Nations is moving to address 
some of Aidid's most pressing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council is preparing a new resolution -- which could pass this 
week -- expected to mandate a much-reduced U.N. role after the U.S. withdrawal. 
The measure calls for "voluntary" disarmament, with modest U.N. aid to those 
clan factions that go along. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the diplomats have become more optimistic, U.S. strategists worry 
that the situation on the streets has become potentially more dangerous -- 
particularly in Mogadishu. 
</P>
<P>
 According to reports from that city, Somali youths toting M-16 rifles and 
AK-47 assault weapons once again have become fixtures downtown. Militiamen have 
taken over some key checkpoints. And violence is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's nightmare is that Somali militiamen will launch an eleventh-hour 
attack on departing U.S. forces, reminiscent of North Vietnam's rout of Saigon 
in 1975. The visions of American forces caught in a panicky retreat from there 
by helicopter still are fresh in planners' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. forces already are training Malaysian and Pakistani troops, who will take 
over the bulk of the enforcement burden after the Americans leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But senior U.S. officials said that they are worried that the U.N. forces may 
be hampered by the same ambiguous strategy and chain of command that have 
plagued U.N. operations throughout the Somali venture.

 When Joe Namson got into the service station business after World War II, 
attendants skittered around customers' cars to wipe dust from the fenders and 
clean the floor mats -- even for drivers who bought only a couple gallons of 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at Namson's station on a well-trafficked corner in Sherman Oaks -- a 
sturdy survivor of the Jan. 17 quake -- patrons perform their own service, such 
as it is. Their credit is approved at the pump, through a direct satellite link 
to Unocal Corp. The average fill-up takes 1 minute, 9 seconds flat. 
</P>
<P>
 While stations around his close down, the victims of grinding competition, 
Namson slices his profit margin on self-serve regular gas to as low as 2 1/2 
cents a gallon. He inspects his operation daily -- especially the underground 
fuel tanks; if he misses a problem, the sanitation, fire, occupational safety 
and environmental regulators may descend. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the most dramatic transformation in the history of retail 
gasoline sales, Namson and thousands of other dealers around the country are 
keeping their eye on the horizon, for even more change is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The next incarnation of the service station -- what some like to call the 
"energy fueling plaza" -- will invite drivers to pull in to buy a tank of 
gasoline or natural gas and a loaf of bread, send a fax or pick up the laundry 
or grab a Big Mac to go. Lube jobs and traditional gas-pump repartee -- 
perhaps, someday, human contact of any kind -- aren't part of the vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that much fun anymore," sighs Namson, 75, who used to know all his 
regulars by name. "There's no personal touch between customers and the dealer. 
And now it's even more impersonal. You go stick the card in the pump. Even the 
guy in the booth doesn't get to know anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two decades, Namson's tidy corner of the world petroleum industry 
-- like tens of thousands of stations across the country -- has been caught up 
in massive change that runs far deeper than the dust on his customers' 
windshields. 
</P>
<P>
 Erratic oil prices, changing customer demand, costly environmental rules, 
high-volume competitors -- and, less obviously, the development of more 
durable, reliable cars -- have buffeted the gas station business. 
</P>
<P>
 Namson's corner, at Van Nuys and Ventura boulevards, has supported a service 
station since 1932, when the boxy Model A was the nation's favorite auto. 
Namson has been in the business nearly as long -- 45 years, 30 at this site. 
</P>
<P>
 He's one of the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, more than 226,000 traditional full-service stations existed 
nationwide. Today, fewer than half that number are still in business -- but 
there are more than 70,000 self-serve mega-stations and an equal number of 
convenience stores that also sell gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to clean your windows and check the tires," said one gasoline 
marketing veteran. "Now we try to sell you doughnuts -- at $4 each." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Before the mid-1970s, oil companies competed by marketing cheap, low-octane 
"fighting grades" of gasoline in what became an industry of gaudy gas wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers wooed customers with free chickens, cigarettes, Hula-Hoops, 
flashlights, coffee mugs and trading stamps -- as well as the occasional mink 
coats and Cadillacs. In 1969, Namson tripled tire sales -- from 30 to more than 
100 a week -- with a promotion touting "Bare-Bottom Prices" on placards carried 
by bikini-clad models, ignoring neighbors who condemned the display as obscene. 
</P>
<P>
 The graciousness and the goodies all but ended with a quiet meeting Oct. 17, 
1973, in Kuwait City. To little notice in the United States, then obsessed by 
Watergate, the Arab world's oil ministers had agreed on an embargo -- primarily 
aimed at punishing America for supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War, which 
had erupted 11 days earlier. On top of existing gasoline shortages, the embargo 
quadrupled crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 What followed was a revolution in gasoline marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers decided that gasoline was a commodity -- that a gallon of one brand 
performed pretty much like a gallon of another. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, although some differences remain in additives from brand to brand, 
federal pipeline regulations by the early 1970s essentially had set national 
standards for octane and other gasoline characteristics. Consumers tried 
off-brands and found -- to their surprise -- that their cars ran fine. 
</P>
<P>
 So when prices soared under the embargo, thousands began regularly refueling 
at the cheapest place in town. 
</P>
<P>
 That put dealers in a squeeze. Most are independent entrepreneurs, paying fees 
to use the oil company's brand name whether they own their station and the land 
under it or lease them from the company. Like many small-business owners, 
dealers can make a comfortable living -- when the economies of their industry 
are favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prices were rising at the pump, however, dealers found themselves in 
a vise. Their profits were held down by Nixon Administration price controls. 
Also, as the embargo took hold, each station's fuel supply was rationed. 
</P>
<P>
 So while Arab producers and big U.S. oil companies enjoyed record revenues as 
world crude oil prices skyrocketed, U.S. dealers -- often with nothing in their 
tanks to sell -- faced lines of angry motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, it was a hairy situation," said Don Smith, editor of the 
venerable National Petroleum News. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25,000 service stations -- more than 10% of the nation's stock -- 
closed in the two months after the Kuwait City meeting. Those that toughed it 
out were forced to operate as cheaply as possible, with most choosing the 
supermarket strategy of low profit margins and high volume. And they did it 
mostly by firing the help and putting in self-service pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, self-service was a Los Angeles innovation, introduced by 
independent Urich Oil Co. in 1947. Self-serve stations had become pesky 
competitors to the major full-service chains in the 1960s -- particularly the 
coin-operated Gasamat chain in 11 Western states and the distinctly low-rent 
Hep-Ur-Sef stations in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Texas and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 But until the embargo, the major oil companies had fought off self-service by 
enlisting fire marshals -- in part with stories of explosions caused by smokers 
standing too close to the pumps -- who in turn encouraged state legislatures to 
declare self-service unsafe. To this day, Oregon and New Jersey ban public 
sales of self-serve gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, 85% of all gasoline sold in the United States is pumped 
self-service -- the single biggest transformation in retail gasoline history. 
And with the shift has come the huge, low-price stations in prime locations 
that the industry calls "pumpers." 
</P>
<P>
 Pumpers wield powerful economies of scale. A central attendant can take the 
money for dozens of pumps. Such new operating costs as environmental cleanups 
can be spread over higher gross sales. 
</P>
<P>
 When Joe Namson and his brother, John, took over a station on the Westside 
after World War II, they became a hot success by jumping sales from 5,000 to 
30,000 gallons a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some big oil companies try to dump franchisees unless they pump at least 
100,000 gallons a month. These days, Namson, who gets a daily tank-truck load 
of gasoline from Unocal, sells more than 200,000 gallons a month. Some 
big-volume stations pump up to 500,000 gallons a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's going for volume," Namson says warily, "but the pie is only so 
big." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The latest plague on dealers is a steady fall in demand for gasoline in recent 
years. New cars are more energy efficient. And the economy has been stalled, 
reducing companies' need to transport goods and people. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, low world crude prices have kept an ocean of petroleum on 
the market. That has kept prices at the pump, adjusted for inflation, at 
1947-era lows. Profits have sagged for dealers and oil company marketing 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the oil companies have tightened their belts. Most have moved to 
concentrate retail stations near refineries -- to cut transportation costs and 
get the biggest bang for their regional advertising buck. Across the country, 
stations have been traded, sold or shut down -- whether the local operators 
liked it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal is closing 20% of its California stations. Arco retreated to the West 
Coast after 1985, trimming its network of stations from 3,900 in 18 states to 
1,600 in California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Texaco swapped 92 
Northern California stations for 84 Exxon stations in California and Nevada; 
since 1989, Texaco has closed more than 3,200 of its 17,000 stations 
nationwide. Chevron in the last decade has shrunk its service station network 
almost 30%, down to 8,700 stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 After a particularly bitter battle with its Southern California dealers, Exxon 
just pulled down its signs from stations that held a 3.4% share of the market 
in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, former Exxon dealer Ray Daryaie has raised the Mobil flag at his 
station at White Oak Avenue and Ventura Boulevard in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Daryaie invested $600,000 to buy the gas station, washing his hands 
of a career as an architect and interior designer. "So much bankruptcy, 
husbands and wives divorcing," he recalls of his former life. "This way, I take 
my money home at the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 And the gas station's profits? "Fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 At least they were in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, dealers set their pump price, based on wholesale prices, operating 
costs and whatever the traffic will bear -- considering, always, the 
competition across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Daryaie had a gross profit margin of 12, 13 even 16 cents a gallon. 
By the end of 1990, it was down to 6 or 8 cents. After Exxon announced it was 
pulling out, the margin dropped to 3 to 5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the same period, the rent he paid Exxon climbed from $5,600 to $9,500 a 
month, Daryaie says, and environmental compliance costs, license fees and taxes 
ballooned as dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Small-business operators have few choices about making ends meet in tough 
times. Daryaie started with 36 employees and 12 service bays for tuneups and 
minor repairs. Now he has 12 employees and six service bays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oil company would not reduce their margin," Daryaie says. "We had to do 
it, to stay alive. . . . I had to sell my life insurance. I had to cash in all 
my savings, everything I had, little by little." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, he's back to the rough industry standard of an 8-cent profit 
margin. And he hopes to expand. Daryaie expects to add a tire sales and 
alignment franchise and a carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 But he won't try to do more repair work. The oil change, lube and repair side 
of the business -- known as the "back room" in dealer parlance -- is a dying 
proposition for most stations. The villain? Mainly the much-improved 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, many auto makers recommended lubrication and oil changes 
for new cars every 1,000 miles, and new tires and tuneups every 15,000 to 
20,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Better lubricants, the steel-belted radial tire and other advances have 
changed the schedule to a lube and oil change at about 7,000 miles and a tire 
change at 40,000 to 50,000 miles. Cadillac's Northstar engine, with platinum 
spark plugs, is being promoted as capable of going 100,000 miles before its 
first tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, the expensive diagnostic equipment demanded by highly specialized 
on-board computers is sending more drivers to dealerships for tuneups when they 
are needed. And many busy drivers have taken to getting routine fluid changes 
at independent quick-stop chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some station operators are reluctant to give up their back rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Yee has had repair bays for the last 16 years at his Eagle Rock station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry thinks snack shops and convenience stores are the way to go, not 
repair," says the Shell dealer. "But that's not for me. I love this 
neighborhood repair business. You meet a lot of people and it's more 
profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arco -- a company apart in the sometimes lock-step retail gasoline business -- 
decided quite the opposite back in the early 1970s. The first major brand to 
embrace self-serve pumps, the company drastically restructured to aim at 
low-price, high-volume sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In the prime station locations it retained, Arco buried larger storage tanks. 
It serviced them with bigger trucks: tankers that carried 1,800 to 2,000 
gallons were replaced by 8,500- to 9,000-gallon models, greatly reducing the 
cost of supplying the Los Angeles company's stations. 
</P>
<P>
 And Arco replaced most of its repair operations with AM/PM Mini Market 
convenience stores. Arco also started its own chain of quick-lube shops and 
Smog Check stations, dumped credit cards and revamped its refineries to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Today -- with about 90% fewer stations than it had in 1975 -- the company 
sells a third more gasoline. And it is experimenting with two-acre plazas that 
include pumps, convenience stores, lube shops and other operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are conducting their own experiments. Unocal, Conoco, Amoco and Sunoco 
are putting alternative fuels -- mostly propane, methanol and natural gas -- on 
the pump islands. "We want to bring alternative fuels to Main Street U.S.A.," 
says Shel Vedlitz, Conoco's alternative fuels marketing manager. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chevron, which introduced the first direct satellite hookup for paying at 
the pump -- on the same satellite used by National Public Radio -- is looking 
hard at the burger business. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco-based company has half a dozen stations on the same site 
with Taco Bell outlets in the Dallas area and a Burger King/Chevron operation 
in Miami. Mobil has a similar trial with McDonald's at a station in Bricktown, 
N.J., and two in Naples, Fla. -- although the company says badly chosen sites 
and other problems doomed two West Coast experiments with Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's looking for the magic bullet," says William Berghoff, Chevron 
general manager of brand services. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea -- the buzz of the industry -- has merit, retail gasoline analyst 
Trilby Lundberg says. "Fueling the tank and the tummy? Truck stops have known 
about this for years," Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, personal service continues to wane. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called ghost stations -- automated, 24-hour sites that don't require 
attendants -- have been discussed for years by various big marketers but have 
not caught on. But in Oregon, 40,000 fleet customers -- from taxi companies to 
dump truck contractors -- now use 300 such stations around the state.

CABLE NETWORKS TO UNVEIL PLAN ON VIOLENT PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Threatened with regulation by Congress, the major U.S. cable networks will 
unveil a plan this morning to control portrayals of violence in their 
programming. Among the steps will be establishment of an outside monitor to 
report annually on the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Cox, president of the Showtime network, will make the announcement on 
Capitol Hill on behalf of the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes as efforts are under way in Congress to write legislation that 
would impose government curbs on television broadcasters and cable companies in 
an effort to protect children from graphic portrayals of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials familiar with the cable plan said that it also includes an agreement 
to establish a rating system for violent programming, as well as endorsement of 
a new technology that would allow parents to keep violent programs from being 
broadcast in their homes. The plan, entitled "Voices Against Violence," has 
been approved by board members of the National Cable Television Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox networks also reportedly are preparing to 
announce an independent monitoring plan developed in closed-door negotiations 
with Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), long an advocate of reducing violent programming 
on television. Officials said that the network monitoring system would be 
separate from that of the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon had threatened to sponsor legislation to establish a federal agency to 
monitor violent programming if the networks were not able to agree on a system. 
</P>
<P>
 In congressional hearings last year, members of the House and Senate berated 
television broadcasters and cable operators for what they termed gratuitous 
portrayals of violence. Leading psychologists testified to a link between 
on-screen violence and violent crimes by young people. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, executives pledged to clean up the industry. In July, the major 
TV networks announced that they would begin this fall using a parental advisory 
label for violent programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno added a stern warning from the 
Clinton Administration. Testifying before a Senate panel, Reno said that the 
television industry must voluntarily reduce violence or "government action will 
be imperative." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the parental advisory labels and establishment of industry 
standards to discourage gratuitous violence are "positive . . . but extremely 
small steps." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said that the Administration is prepared to support tough legislation to 
deal with the problem. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) has sponsored a bill to 
restrict violent programming to late-night hours. Other bills would require the 
Federal Communications Commission to issue periodic reports listing programs 
that contain the most violence as well as their commercial sponsors. They also 
would mandate on-screen warning labels and advance notification of violent 
content in TV listings and would seek to discourage the advertisement of 
violent programs during family shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable industry's plan supports legislation by Rep. Edward J. Markey 
(D-Mass.) for a blocking mechanism on TV sets, known as a V-chip, that parents 
could use to screen out violent programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan supported by the cable industry calls for a voluntary rating system 
that would "have the participation and support of the entire television 
industry, including the broadcast networks and independent stations." However, 
some broadcast officials said last year that they were unlikely to agree to a 
ratings system and they have not supported the V-chip. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the cable plan also calls for "responsible scheduling" to 
avoid airing violent programs during hours when children might be watching.

IN GAZA, FEAR OF ANARCHY TRIGGERS ILLEGAL-ARMS BOOM; MIDEAST: PALESTINIANS 
WORRY ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL WILL LEAVE VOID IN WHICH FEUDS, POLITICAL VIOLENCE CAN 
GROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Soon after Monsour Shawa was appointed mayor of Gaza City, a friend called to 
congratulate him and recommend a first order of business: Buy a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "He offered to sell me one -- a 9-millimeter automatic," said the prominent 
Gaza businessman. "I said, 'What's the price?' When he told me, I said, 'No 
thank you, I'll take my chances.' " The price: $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the cost of weaponry is soaring -- just three months ago, a 
9-millimeter pistol went for a third that amount -- Gaza's black market in 
illegal arms is booming. The reason: fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Shawa, Palestinians throughout the occupied territories have been 
scrambling to stock up on pistols, machine guns, assault rifles and ammunition 
in recent months, most of them desperate for a measure of personal protection 
in advance of Israel's promised withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 For Israel, the weapons proliferation illustrates an issue that has been 
central to the delay in its troop withdrawal, originally scheduled to begin 
last Dec. 13 and put off for at least another week late Sunday when talks 
between PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres 
ended in Switzerland without a final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly out of fear of an even larger influx of firepower into their back yard, 
Israeli negotiators have been insisting that their troops maintain military 
control of the border crossings into the new Palestinian entity. The 
Palestinians have insisted that policing the borders is critical to their new 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The border controversy was at the top of the list of tentative weekend 
compromises made by Arafat and Peres. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the growing gun problem in the territories is a concern as 
human as it is political. It is the shared worry among Israelis and 
Palestinians that the dawning of a new age of autonomy after nearly three 
decades under strict military occupation will bring a new era of anarchy as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of confusion and fear in Gaza for ordinary people," said 
Shawa, whom Arafat named chief executive of the capital of the emerging 
autonomous Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fear of the unknown, a fear that if there is no law, no order, no one 
to settle feuds, there is going to be a period of trouble. People are desperate 
to have protection." 
</P>
<P>
 The run on guns in Gaza has driven the price of a U.S.-made M-16 rifle to 
nearly $9,000 -- a jump of $2,000 in two months. A Russian-made AK-47 goes for 
$6,500. The price of a single bullet that sells for 30 cents in Israel now 
costs $4 in the occupied territories, a premium that has drawn children to 
scavenge at Israeli army firing ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinians, and some Israeli lawmakers, blame the Israeli military for 
the proliferation of arms. Israeli troops still control the territories' 
borders, and critics assert that border guards deliberately permit the weapons 
and ammunition to pass through their checkpoints from Egypt and Jordan. In a 
land where such conspiracy theories are common after 27 years of 
sometimes-harsh military occupation, those critics suggest that the Israeli aim 
is to fuel future infighting among the territories' many Palestinian factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Mordechai Gur flatly denied that charge last 
week, and sources in the Israel Defense Forces called the allegation "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Gur's denial, delivered in the Israeli Parliament, or Knesset, reflected the 
elevation of the gun issue to an integral part of Israel's national debate on 
the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to charges by Israeli legislators that the army is ignoring the 
arms surge in the territories, Gur confirmed in the Knesset that Palestinians 
in the territories are stockpiling weapons. But he insisted in his testimony 
that the Israel Defense Forces are working hard to track down and destroy arms 
caches in Gaza and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you even conceive of such a thing?" Gur asked the legislators who 
raised the issue. "Is it even conceivable that we would treat a flow of weapons 
to the Gaza Strip calmly, when our soldiers are in the strip and fighting in 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Gur said, the military is intensifying its weapons searches 
throughout the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 There was ample evidence in recent weeks to support his assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week in the small West Bank village of Aboud, Israeli soldiers conducted 
a weapons search as destructive as it was meticulous at a Palestinian house 
that is now riddled with holes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the home of Mahmoud Abdul Majid, whose five sons were arrested in early 
January as suspected Palestinian terrorists. Two of the boys were released two 
weeks later. The other three were kept in an Israeli jail for further 
interrogation. Last week, the army returned to the Abdul Majid's house and 
systematically began taking it apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The family showed a visiting reporter walls that had been cracked open, floors 
ripped up, a bathroom torn inside out and the bedroom of one of the detained 
sons -- a 28-year-old plumber -- taken completely apart. Throughout the search, 
which the family said took 14 hours and spanned two days, the soldiers told 
them they were looking for an arms stockpile the family insisted did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli military spokesman confirmed that soldiers had conducted the 
search. The Abdul Majid house was targeted, he said, because the brothers were 
caught with bomb-making materials when they were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The army spokesman stressed that the search exhibited "the ongoing efforts by 
the Israel Defense Forces to locate and identify illegal weapons in the 
territories -- especially among those who are against the peace." But he 
confirmed that in the end, nothing was found at the Abdul Majid house. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinians do not blame Israel's security forces alone for the recent 
arms flow into the territories. Some leveled charges of negligence against the 
leaders of several Palestinian factions represented in Gaza, particularly 
Arafat's Fatah wing. That faction will supply most of the officers in the 
Palestinian police force planned for control of law and order in Gaza and 
Jericho as Israel withdraws. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Palestine Liberation Organization leaders confirm that it will be up to 
the new police to crack down on the weapons flow after the Israelis withdraw. 
But Shawa and other members of Arafat's handpicked team fear it may be too late 
by then. 
</P>
<P>
 Their fear goes beyond the potential for armed conflict between Fatah and an 
extremist opposition of fundamentalist Islamic groups and leftist political 
parties that also sponsor well-armed rebels in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the worry is grounded in ancient family feuds that have simmered 
beneath the surface of Gaza's society throughout the occupation. Israel's 
military presence, combined with a shared commitment among most Gazans to join 
forces against a more powerful common enemy, froze most of those feuds in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the memory is long in Gaza," Shawa said. "Maybe it was a woman, maybe a 
rape, maybe a piece of land. Maybe it happened 30 years ago, or maybe 300. But 
everyone here remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that guns are everywhere here, this could be a disaster. If the police 
fail to take immediate control -- a difficult task even in the best of times -- 
these feuds easily could explode the moment the common enemy is gone."

O.C. SEEKING $1 MILLION TO FIGHT FIRE FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County will ask the federal government for about $1 million more in 
disaster relief to help local residents, especially children, deal with 
lingering psychological trauma from the fall firestorms. 
</P>
<P>
 County Mental Health Director Timothy P. Mullins said hundreds of children 
whose families or friends lost homes in the devastating fires continue to have 
problems with concentration, nightmares and bed wetting. In addition, there is 
lingering trauma for others, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Some children, Mullins said, even react with signs of panic to the Santa Ana 
winds, which were blamed for whipping the October flames into a mobile inferno. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of requests for children," Mullins said. "We have some cases 
where children are sleeping with their mothers and fathers at age 13." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Orange County Board of Supervisors is expected to approve 
today a request for aid totaling $991,194. The county has already received 
about $400,000 in federal mental health aid related to fire damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, counselors who work for the county and local community 
health clinics would provide the counseling to adults and children. One program 
would be a stress-management session featuring clinical psychologist Robert 
Scott, who specializes in trauma/disaster psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 26-page grant application, county officials estimated that 400 children 
are considered at "high risk" of post-fire trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was noted that children are experiencing an increasing sense of 
vulnerability, anger, fear and anxiety over the fire losses," officials stated 
in the report. "Such children are increasingly seeking support elsewhere: in 
drug use and gang-like peer groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mullins said Laguna Beach and other South County communities have 
"experienced a good deal of healing" since the massive destruction last fall, 
the need for more help remains as Southern California shifts its attention from 
one disaster to another. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, some local resources and counselors once dedicated to 
firestorm survivors have been diverted to help victims of the recent Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 10 days, Mullins said about 30 county Mental Health Department 
workers have been dispatched to Los Angeles County to counsel those suffering 
from the immediate problems of home loss and extended homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the local counselors have been working in the "tent cities" where some 
residents have been living since the quake shook Los Angeles two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need up there is literally overwhelming," Mullins said. "Our people have 
been up there working 13- to 14-hour shifts." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Orange County, Mullins said that although children are among the most 
severely affected, other segments of the population are still experiencing 
post-fire troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Older adults, who make up about 14% of Laguna's population, "are still fearful 
that they will not be safe from arson," officials said in the county 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some still take their belongings with them wherever they go and many are 
reluctant to buy items of value," officials said. "Many older adults are 
isolated . . . and not inclined to seek services from unfamiliar programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of homes and other valuables for widowed older residents has been 
especially difficult as the lost items represent the only ties to a deceased 
spouse, Mullins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local homeless service providers also report an increasing number of contacts 
with the "chronically homeless" after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these individuals are those who camped in the canyon before the 
fire," officials said. "Others are emotionally handicapped individuals who, 
prior to the fire, were living with family or friends. The disruption of the 
fire has exacerbated their conditions and now makes a shared living arrangement 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 In their grant request, officials estimated that neighborhood and 
environmental restoration "will require years," especially in Laguna Beach, 
where hundreds of homes and thousands of acres of parklands were ravaged.

SEISMIC EXPERTS SEE COLLEGE BUILDINGS AS POTENTIAL DEATHTRAPS; QUAKES: 
OFFICIALS HAVE KNOWN OF HAZARDS SINCE 1979. FUNDING DIFFICULTIES AND A DESIRE 
TO AVOID DISRUPTIONS HAVE COMBINED TO DELAY CORRECTING THEM. 
</P>

<P>
 California's public universities are dotted with scores of classroom 
buildings, faculty offices and student hangouts that seismic experts warn could 
become deathtraps during major earthquakes like the one centered in the San 
Fernando Valley last month, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 State lawmakers and college officials have known about the earthquake hazards 
since at least 1979, when the state Seismic Safety Commission released a 
benchmark survey urging that 434 campus buildings be examined because they 
could pose significant risks to life. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has only been in recent years that the universities -- which are exempt 
from state and local earthquake standards -- have begun or stepped up 
construction programs aimed at shoring up walls, securing foundations and 
reinforcing the masonry skin on potentially unsafe structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the campus buildings in Southern California that have seismic hazards 
scheduled for retrofitting are UC Irvine's central plant and dance rehearsal 
addition, and Cal State Fullerton's library, bookstore/commons, humanities and 
social sciences, Langsdorf and physical education buildings and the health 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays in repairs have resulted from a combination of funding 
difficulties, the desire to avoid campus disruptions and a push to put up new 
buildings to keep up with growing enrollment, say university officials and 
their critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish they would go faster, I wish they were completed by now," said L. 
Thomas Tobin, the commission's executive director. "There's such a threat to 
life in these major buildings but the fact is that you can only do so many 
buildings at one time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20-campus California State University system -- with 327,000 students, 
the second-largest higher education system in the nation -- administrators have 
only recently compiled a list of 101 structures or "falling hazards" that need 
retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list are such heavily used areas as the John M. Pfau Library at 
Cal State San Bernardino; Humboldt State University's Jolly Giant dining 
commons, where all on-campus residence meals are served; the McIntosh 
humanities building and Fine Arts buildings at Cal State Long Beach and a 
library at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Also high on the list is Cal State Northridge's Sierra Tower, a seven-story 
complex of faculty offices and classrooms that sustained some of the school's 
heaviest damage during the Jan. 17 temblor. The structure, a mile from the 
epicenter, was to receive a $167,000 earthquake make-over this year, Cal State 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, University of California officials have identified 87 structures on 
their nine campuses yet to be fixed despite being considered poor or very poor 
seismic risks. These structures include landmarks on the two campuses with the 
highest seismic risks -- UCLA and Berkeley, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Royce Hall, the 1929 architectural symbol for the UCLA campus 
and the frequent backdrop for college scenes in movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA landmark, which had been scheduled for retrofitting in 1996, was 
closed for a week after the Northridge quake because its twin brick towers, 
weakened by cracks, threatened to fall. Portions of Royce Hall were reopened 
last week but only after crews built a special tunnel as an emergency exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators admit they are racing against the seismic clock but blame the 
Legislature for being slow to provide the hundreds of millions of dollars 
needed for wholesale retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects that get financed still face long delays because each phase -- 
planning, design, construction -- must go to Sacramento for budget approval. 
Even if the money were to suddenly materialize, university officials said, 
retrofitting is a logistical nightmare on a busy campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: The current retrofitting of UCLA's Powell Library. It took 
eight years to plan and required relocating 200,000 books to a specially 
constructed tent. And while the actual seismic work cost $11 million, other 
building and fire code upgrades for the 64-year-old building brought the price 
tag to $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be difficult to take all of the (older) buildings down at once and 
keep the campus functioning," said Cynthia Ingram, UCLA's assistant director 
for capital planning. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics and seismic experts say university officials have been part of the 
problem, largely ignoring -- and sometimes flouting -- the earthquake dangers 
on their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to attract more faculty, more students, more donors, it pays off 
to be opening handsome new buildings," said state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica). "The alternative is admitting that some buildings are dangerous to 
human life and that's really difficult to take responsibility for. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Faced with that, they cross their fingers and tap the table and hope the Big 
One doesn't hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes, campus administrators made matters worse, according to a 
November, 1990, Seismic Safety Commission report. In one glaring example, the 
agency scored UC Berkeley administrators for building weight rooms and coaching 
offices under Memorial Stadium, although they had been warned that the 
unreinforced 1920s structure straddles a fault that creeps noticeably each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report applauded UC for deciding to borrow $50 million on its own for 
retrofitting work after the Loma Prieta earthquake, but pointed out that 49 of 
the structures most in need of work were left off the repair list. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 report also reached the "unavoidable conclusion" that the Cal State 
system, where 1950s and 1960s concrete frame buildings pose serious earthquake 
hazards, had no retrofitting program at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The university system (is) not going to get to some of those buildings for 
10, 20 years," lamented Commissioner Lloyd S. Cluff at a commission hearing 
just before the report was released. "And so we're guaranteeing that the crisis 
is going to be created out of killing a lot of people on the campuses." 
</P>
<P>
 No one was killed or injured on university campuses in the Northridge quake, 
which struck at 4:31 a.m. of a day on which no classes were scheduled. A 
student was killed at Cal State Los Angeles when a concrete slab fell from a 
parking structure in the 1987 Whittier quake. Her family agreed to a 
$1.4-million settlement from the state and a construction company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seismic Safety Commission and Hayden sponsored a bill in the Legislature 
to require warning signs on all of the seismically vulnerable campus buildings. 
But UC lobbyists blocked the move, arguing that the warning signs would be 
disruptive and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding that bureaucratic resistance, say seismologists and structural 
engineers, was the fact that California's universities do not have to follow 
the state and local earthquake codes imposed on other public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The codes cover classrooms for kindergarten through community college students 
and require some load-bearing walls to be 15% stronger than normal. The act 
required public school districts to strengthen or raze all pre-1933 buildings 
by mid-1977 and mandated that all classroom designs and construction be 
supervised by the state architect's office as a double check. 
</P>
<P>
 As state entities, however, universities do not have to follow those rules. 
Had the same standards applied, said Dennis Bellet of the state architect's 
office, there would be no wondering about Royce Hall today. "That would have 
either been retrofitted or closed down by June 30, 1977," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, UCLA's immunity allowed administrators to use $13 million in private 
funds to renovate the historic structure before the 1984 Olympics without 
dedicating anything for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 A campus committee denounced the move when it warned in 1985 that Royce and 24 
other buildings could kill 2,000 people during a major quake along any of the 
three nearby faults. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA officials say they begged for state money to retrofit Royce but were 
turned down. Still, others say, they now look foolish not to have found a way 
to make the seismic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were the people who made the private donations, I'd be pretty upset 
because it just went down the toilet, didn't it?" said Bill Petak executive 
director of USC's Institute for Safety and Systems Management. "It's now a 
building with major problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Private colleges have had a better retrofitting record. The 1990 Seismic 
Safety Commission report made a strong point of showing how, in contrast to UC, 
Stanford officials diverted nearly all of their discretionary funds to upgrade 
their buildings after the Loma Prieta quake did major damage there. 
</P>
<P>
 As a private institution, USC spent $18 million to upgrade or demolish its 
older buildings after the city of Los Angeles passed a 1983 ordinance calling 
for the retrofitting of unreinforced masonry structures. USC architect Mark M. 
Jones said the school will have to spend "tens of millions" more if the city 
passes another ordinance requiring the upgrading of unreinforced masonry "fill" 
buildings with concrete frames. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, said Tobin of the state's seismic commission, Cal State 
administrators have been showing increased concern. They have hired the state 
architect's office to help monitor construction and have compiled the list of 
101 future retrofitting projects.

HIGH COURT DENIES PAYOUT OF LIFE INSURANCE IN OVERDOSE; LAW: STATE JURISTS SAY 
FAMILY CANNOT COLLECT ON A PORTION OF COVERAGE BECAUSE MAN COULD HAVE EXPECTED 
PROBLEMS FROM COCAINE USE. RULING DRAWS FINE LINE FOR DEATHS BY 'ACCIDENTAL 
MEANS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The California Supreme Court held Monday that the Orange County survivors of a 
man who voluntarily ingested cocaine and died of an overdose cannot collect 
life insurance benefits intended to cover deaths by "accidental means." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 5-2 decision, the court said that the death was not caused by "accidental 
means" because the deceased could have reasonably anticipated that death or 
great bodily injury would occur from ingesting a hazardous, illegal drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling leaves California in the minority of states that distinguish 
insurance coverage for accidental death from that for death caused by 
"accidental means." Under the latter definition, a fatality that results from 
an intentional action that could lead to death -- such as participating in a 
particularly dangerous sport -- would not be covered, according to one of the 
attorneys in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Courts around the country have abolished the distinction because it is a 
distinction without meaning," said Santa Ana attorney Richard A. Cohn. "To 
uphold the distinction simply allows the Supreme Court to choose when and where 
it wants to draw the line. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The case was brought by the Santa Ana mother and sister of Michael P. Weil, 
who died at 32 of a cocaine overdose. Weil, an engineer in the semiconductor 
industry, was in San Francisco on business in 1985 and was staying at one of 
the city's most elegant hotels when he ingested enough cocaine to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Kemper Life Assurance Company paid his mother and sister, Lola Brown 
Weil and Michelle Weil of Santa Ana, $100,000 as beneficiaries of the life 
insurance policy but refused to allow them to collect another $100,000 under an 
accidental death rider in the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial court and a Court of Appeal ruled against the insurance company, which 
appealed the case to the state's high court. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . It is clear," said Justice Ronald George, writing for the majority, 
"that California cases in a variety of factual settings have interpreted 
policies affording coverage for death effected through accidental means to 
preclude coverage for voluntary and intentional conduct that results in 
unintended death." 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Stanley Mosk and Joyce Kennard, the most moderate members of the 
conservative court, dissented in a 106-page opinion that was twice as long as 
the majority decision. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that the survivors are entitled to collect under the policy 
because the overdose was accidental. "In all cases in which the insured's act 
was more than negligent but not tantamount to suicide," Mosk wrote, "the 
insured can reasonably expect to be covered." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosk noted that cocaine-related deaths are only a recent phenomenon, and at 
the time of Weil's death, the drug was the recreational choice of young, 
upwardly mobile professionals such as Weil. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence indicated Weil was only an occasional user and did not expect to 
be harmed by the drug, Mosk said. Only 3.6% of all cocaine-related deaths in 
1985 were caused by orally ingesting the drug, the method apparently used by 
Weil, the justice said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Far from believing that death would follow in all probability," Mosk wrote, 
"the reasonable person would have believed it highly improbable that such 
modest recreational use would kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn, the attorney for Weil's mother and sister, said the majority decision 
was one more in a long line of pro-insurance industry rulings by the state's 
high court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just a tragedy to see the California Supreme Court narrowing the 
ability for victims and people who have been injured to recover for their 
losses," he said. "At every turn, the California Supreme Court is going toward 
helping the insurance industry." But Daniel Maguire, the Los Angeles attorney 
who represented Kemper, said the ruling correctly "furthers the public policy 
in California that we should not treat manifestly dangerous activity the same 
as an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 "If people engage in violent, dangerous, illegal and reckless behavior," 
Maguire said, "there is not going to be double indemnity under these types of 
policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the beneficiaries of the policy nor the insurance company could be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case decided Monday, the court held that a logging plan approved 
before the Northern spotted owl was declared a threatened species can still 
stand but will have to be amended to conform to later rules intended to protect 
the animal. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for an environmental group said the decision will affect a handful 
of logging plans in California.

DEUKMEJIAN TO REPRESENT INSURER BEFORE HIGH COURT; LAW: EX-GOVERNOR APPOINTED 
FIVE OF SEVEN JUSTICES WHO WILL HEAR THE CASE. HE IS ARGUING TO HAVE A FORMER 
BACKER'S SURETY FIRM EXEMPTED FROM PROP. 103 RATE ROLLBACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Former Gov. George Deukmejian, now a lawyer in private practice, has signed on 
to represent an insurance company owned by his onetime leading campaign 
contributor in a case pending before the California Supreme Court, five of 
whose seven members he appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer, Northridge-based Surety Co. of the Pacific, is fighting, along 
with the rest of the industry, to get the Supreme Court to uphold a 1990 law -- 
which Deukmejian signed -- that exempts surety companies from the rate 
rollbacks required by Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield said Deukmejian's involvement is "a 
threat to the integrity of the judicial branch." He asserted that this instance 
would be the first time a former governor represented a law client before the 
California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how the court can properly face a guy who's been either a law 
partner, an employer or a benefactor of five of them," Rosenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deukmejian appointed Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justices Edward A. 
Panelli, Joyce L. Kennard, Armand Arabian and Marvin R. Baxter. Lucas is a 
former law partner of Deukmejian and Baxter a former aide. The other two 
justices, Stanley Mosk and Ronald M. George, were appointed by Gov. Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown Sr. and Gov. Pete Wilson, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Deukmejian did not return telephone calls for comment at his law office with 
the Los Angeles firm of Sidley & Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether Deukmejian will argue the case in person, but he wrote a 
four-page letter to the court dated Jan. 19 in which he outlined the reasons 
why he thought the high court should hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, in the case of Amwest Surety Insurance Co. vs. Pete Wilson et al, 
the 2nd District Court of Appeal struck down the 1990 law in a 2-1 decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Surety Co. of the Pacific is involved in the case only as a friend of the 
court, supporting Amwest, but it has a strong financial interest in the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Surety companies provide completion bonds and other kinds of performance 
guarantees for construction projects, movies and other ventures. It has been 
estimated that the surety industry as a whole will be liable for price rebates 
of as much as $100 million if it is ultimately found to be subject to 
Proposition 103, the 1988 insurance rollback initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Surety's owner and president, William Erwin, was the leading contributor to 
Deukmejian's 1982 campaign for governor, giving $203,000. From 1978 through 
1989, Surety Co. contributed $243,457 to Deukmejian-controlled campaign 
committees, according to the Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Erwin hung up on a reporter seeking comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, in a statement Monday evening, avoided 
criticizing Deukmejian directly, but said he had faith in the Supreme Court 
justices "being professionals who can and will ignore the high-powered 
political pressure of the insurance companies and will instead decide the case 
on its merits."

TOUGHER CONCEALED GUN PROPOSAL DEFEATED; LEGISLATION: ASSEMBLY REJECTS A PLAN 
TO TRIPLE THE MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR VIOLATORS. NRA OPPOSED THE BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Assembly on Monday defeated legislation supported by law enforcement and 
opposed by the National Rifle Assn. that would increase the maximum penalty for 
illegally carrying a concealed gun from one year to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision of the two powerful interests marked the first test of power in 
an election year legislative session in which crime and public safety are 
expected to be dominant themes. 
</P>
<P>
 After an emotional debate, 34 members -- all Democrats -- voted for the bill; 
40 Republicans and Democrats voted against it. Passage required 41 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would have empowered district attorneys to file either misdemeanor or 
felony charges against people arrested for illegally concealing a firearm in 
their clothing or automobiles. Now, illegal possession of a concealed gun is a 
misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. Making it a felony would have 
increased the maximum penalty to three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was a victory for the NRA, which has sought a political comeback 
after losing the bitterly fought battle over the ban on assault guns in the 
1989 legislative session. The NRA long has fought for the right of citizens to 
arm themselves for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and California chiefs of police and 
sheriffs, defeat of the measure -- authored by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) -- constituted a setback in efforts to get a firmer grip on the 
illegal use of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz forecast that other crime-fighting initiatives restricting the use of 
guns may face a similar fate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this shows is that the NRA (and other gun owner organizations) have 
people so afraid that they can't even vote for a law enforcement bill. That's 
pathetic," an angry Katz told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't pass a bill that gives prosecutors an opportunity (to file felony 
charges), I don't know how they're going to pass anything else," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans argued that instead of making otherwise law-abiding citizens 
potentially subject to a felony, the Legislature should make it easier for them 
to legally pack pistols and revolvers in their clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gun ownership is the best protection from crime," said Assemblyman Trice 
Harvey (R-Bakersfield). 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also asserted that in an era when law enforcement cannot assure 
citizens of protection against criminals, Californians should be granted 
greater access to concealed weapons permits to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of all the taxes that you pay, your government cannot protect you," 
said Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia), who opposed the bill. "Now we want 
to say, 'You can't protect yourself either.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the bill contended that stiffer penalties would discourage 
people who otherwise might carry concealed weapons illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz charged that the NRA had wrongly turned the debate into a gun control 
issue. "This bill doesn't deprive anyone from buying a gun or from 
self-protection," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun permits are issued by police chiefs and sheriffs based on individual 
assessments of the applicant's background and need. 
</P>
<P>
 Rural sheriffs issue more permits than their counterparts in big cities. In 
1992, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 427 
permit holders in Los Angeles County. In sparsely populated Shasta County, 
2,917 residents were licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the state Department of Justice reported that there were 33,345 
Californians licensed to carry concealed weapons in 1992. A decade earlier, 
43,718 were licensed.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; OJAI AND THE BLACK ORB; THE LATEST BATTLE INVOLVES A NATIONAL 
WEATHER SERVICE TOWER. LIKE IT OR NOT, CITIZEN ACTIVISTS HAVE BECOME A 
POLITICAL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This is a well-read, well-educated hamlet that does not easily take no for an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Its residents are more likely to vote than those elsewhere in Ventura County, 
they mobilize quickly and they do not take to those they consider a threat to 
the quality of life in the verdant Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Ojai activists have derailed a would-be landfill, squelched a 
petroleum plant expansion, felled a university site, muscled into a private 
golf resort's development plans and filed numerous lawsuits to protect their 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not -- and many clearly do not -- citizen activists in the Ojai 
Valley have become a political force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very, very bright people," said attorney Mitchel B. Kahn, who 
represented the waste management firm that last year lost a bid to open a 
landfill in a nearby canyon. "Together, they make quite a formidable group." 
</P>
<P>
 A higher percentage of Ojai residents hold college degrees and library cards 
than in Ventura County as a whole. But some say that the location beneath the 
TopaTopa Mountains contributes to the town's individualism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's geographical," said Greg Helms of the Environmental Defense Center, a 
Santa Barbara legal advocacy firm that handles lawsuits for several groups in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you live in the Ojai Valley, you're together in a kind of village," he 
said. "It's a sort of an Old America feeling about the community that lends 
itself to public participation." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at USA Petroleum do not like to talk about Ojai's activism. They are 
apparently still smarting from a citizens panel that 10 years ago thwarted a 
planned $100-million expansion at the firm's Petrochem refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 96 acres have been up for sale ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest political battle cry was sounded after the National Weather Service 
began erecting a 98-foot radar tower atop Sulphur Peak in the upper Ojai 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The tower will greatly enhance their ability to monitor thunderstorms, wind 
currents and other atmospheric conditions, weather service officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Information gleaned from the new system -- designed to replace an aging tower 
in Los Angeles -- will be shared with federal air traffic controllers and 
military brass to help track flight paths and plan strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is urgent that the Sulphur Mountain radar become operational as soon as 
possible," said Thomas Potter, regional director of the weather service. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one told those who live along the pricey ridge that the so-called 
"black orb" was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Upper Ojai residents awoke one crisp morning in early December in the shadow 
of what looked to them like a huge black ball nesting above a thick steel 
scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days they stood in front of a Ventura County Superior Court judge 
arguing for, and receiving, a temporary restraining order prohibiting 
completion of the weather-tracking project. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks since, the government has condemned a portion of a driveway that 
leads to the site, threatened to arrest protesters and unleashed federal 
lawyers to ensure that the project is not delayed further. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, a federal judge sided with the government and refused to issue a 
restraining order blocking construction of the project. Another hearing is set 
for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the radar tower point to research that possibly links higher 
instances of cancer, birth defects, leukemia and other maladies to the kind of 
low-level radiation emitted from the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a highly educated community," said David Hedman, an upper Ojai 
resident who fought the Weldon Canyon dump and is one of the plaintiffs in the 
weather station lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear those fighting the radar and other ecological-legal battles tell it, 
the Ojai Valley is one of the last resting places of popular rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina V. Shelley, an Ojai councilwoman who served a stint in the Marine Corps, 
calls the activist sentiment a mix of Old West tenacity and sheer grit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I operate with when I'm speaking for the community," she said. 
"Don't let go. Don't even consider failing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranch owner Kim Bonsall knows that community doggedness from personal 
experience. She ran headlong into it last year when the Bonsall family was 
about to allow a landfill on part of its 6,500-acre spread in Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire how quickly they got organized," Bonsall said. "But I don't admire 
what they said once they got organized. For any project that goes on, 
(activists) are very quick to say something negative before having all the 
facts in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonsall is not alone. Many private attorneys and local officials have been 
forced to answer to Ojai-based environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do keep me on my toes, no doubt about that," said Richard H. Baldwin, 
director of the county Air Pollution Control District. "They confront us by 
meetings, letters, what have you. Elsewhere in the county, that's not 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 But confrontation can also be an asset, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the business view I hear constantly, but we don't hear the citizen's 
view very often," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 However, lawyers for the firm planning to build a private golf resort on a 
sprawling hillside above the nearby community of Meiners Oaks still hold a 
grudge against the citizen activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some genuinely concerned people up there, but some of the activists 
would have us all living in tepees again," said Lindsay F. Nielson, who 
represents Farmont Corp., which wants to build the golf course. "They simply 
believe that any form of development is evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielson, a board member of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., called many of 
the activist efforts misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai does have a large number of people who are very environmentally in 
tune," he said. "But they aren't interested in what impact (a project) has on 
the economy of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a proposed university campus did not escape the purview of the ecological 
watchdogs. As soon as officials targeted Taylor Ranch, near California 33 and 
U.S. 101, for a state university, opponents concerned about air quality in the 
Ojai Valley went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were planning for 20,000 students," said Pat Baggerly, a Meiners Oaks 
resident and member of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County that 
opposed the site. "And all that (smog) blows up this way." 
</P>
<P>
 The campus is now being planned for a lemon grove outside Camarillo.

WASHINGTON BACKS U.N. PLAN FOR BOSNIA AIR SUPPORT; BALKANS: SECRETARY OF STATE 
CHRISTOPHER'S DECLARATION DRAWS U.S. A STEP CLOSER TO COMBAT OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The United States supports a proposal by U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali to use U.S. and allied air power to help open an airport in 
Bosnia for aid flights and to relieve a beleaguered Canadian peacekeeping unit, 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By offering seemingly unqualified backing for Boutros-Ghali's plan, 
Christopher drew the United States a step closer to combat operations in the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general said last Friday that he was ready to call for allied 
air strikes to punish Serbian guerrillas if they interfere with U.N. efforts to 
rotate the garrison at Srebrenica or to reopen the airport at Tuzla. Both towns 
are crowded with desperate Muslim refugees who have fled fighting elsewhere in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've endorsed that report," Christopher told reporters. "That could lead to 
the use of air power if there's not an agreement for the replacement of the 
Canadian troops at Srebrenica or for the opening of the airport at Tuzla." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl discussed the Bosnia 
conflict Monday during a 1 1/2-hour working lunch at an Italian restaurant in 
Washington's Georgetown neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials discouraged speculation that the discussion -- or talks 
scheduled for later this week with British and European Union leaders -- was 
aimed at forging a new policy to counter French efforts to pressure the 
Muslim-led Bosnian government into accepting a peace settlement that would 
ratify territorial gains registered by Serbian and Croatian militias during the 
bloody ethnic war. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Christopher and other State Department officials have made no 
secret of their distaste for the French approach of applying pressure on the 
Bosnian government, which Washington considers to be the victim of Serbian and 
Croatian aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Before meeting with Clinton, in an address to the National Governors' Assn. in 
Washington, Kohl urged the United States to continue its leadership role in 
world affairs and said that there is a need for a strong European defense 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evil spirits of nationalism are not only at large in the Balkans," Kohl 
said. The "unfortunate signs that war has not yet been banished" make creation 
of a European security policy "more important than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Kohl indicated he would support U.N. efforts to stop the flow of 
Croatian troops across the border into Bosnia. At a news conference, Kohl said 
he could not confirm that such movements were taking place. But if they were, 
he said, he would disapprove "very severely and find a way to (put) my 
disapproval into practice." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Kohl repeated his nation's opposition to sending outside 
ground troops into the conflict. That would create "an incredible blood bath," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali's plan for Srebrenica and Tuzla is a complex combination of 
diplomacy and force. It is designed to permit relief flights to the isolated 
Tuzla enclave and to replace the Canadian unit in Srebrenica with a larger 
Dutch contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 Both towns were designated by the United Nations as "safe areas" for Muslim 
refugees but are targets of steady Serbian bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Boutros-Ghali's proposal, the United Nations would negotiate with the 
Serbs in an effort to obtain their agreement on a cease-fire to permit the 
relief of Tuzla and Srebrenica without opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Serbs agree, U.N. forces would carry out the operations, backed by NATO 
air power, which would be ready to strike in case the Serbs go back on their 
promise. Even if the Serbs do not agree to a cease-fire, Boutros-Ghali said, 
the United Nations might attempt the operations anyway, protected by allied air 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the Clinton Administration agrees 
with Boutros-Ghali that the United States and its allies have the authority to 
provide close air support for U.N. troops without further authorization by 
either the Security Council or NATO's North Atlantic Council.

BOSNIAN SERBS MOBILIZED FOR PUSH ON BESIEGED MUSLIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb commanders Monday ordered mobilization of all able-bodied adults 
in their territory for a final push to defeat the Muslim-led government after 
22 months of siege. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel military chieftains paired the call-up with threats of harsh punishment 
for deserters and anyone who fails to report to military training centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The high command also announced a crackdown on illegal trade, especially with 
enemy forces, reported the Serb-run Tanjug news agency in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-scale mobilization intensified fears of a major offensive against 
this Bosnian capital or the northern city of Tuzla, which the United Nations 
wants to use as a port for humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But the highly publicized directive for all men and women to report to the 
nearest army garrison may be an attempt to intimidate NATO and U.N. forces that 
have threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serb units undermining U.N. 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Military leaders of the self-styled Serbian Republic that covers 70% of Bosnia 
are mustering all available forces "to successfully end the war," Tanjug said 
of the measures. The report claimed the call-up was necessary because "the 
international community has decided to support the Muslims in the war option." 
</P>
<P>
 The mustering appeared to be in reaction to U.N. approval of close North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization air support for operations aimed at opening Tuzla 
airport for humanitarian relief flights and breaking a Serbian blockade of 
Canadian troops guarding the besieged Muslim enclave of Srebrenica. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bosnian Serbs have a huge advantage in weaponry, having inherited 
hundreds of tanks, artillery pieces and aircraft from the Yugoslav People's 
Army, which withdrew from Bosnia in May, 1992, they have fewer fighters and 
flagging morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory appeared at hand last fall when Western mediators at peace talks in 
Geneva accepted what was largely a Serbian plan for carving Bosnia into three 
ethnic ministates. The Serbian province would have covered more than half of 
the once-integrated republic and would eventually have been allowed to secede 
and join fellow Serbs in rump Yugoslavia, gaining international acceptance of 
the state they expanded by force. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Muslim-led government rejected partitioning and has indicated in 
subsequent negotiation sessions that it is prepared to fight on to defend what 
is left of Bosnia rather than accede to an unjust peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Demoralized by the protracted conflict and dwindling prospects for a 
negotiated settlement, the Bosnian Serb rebels have lately endured battlefield 
stalemates and even some losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Irregular troops loyal to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his rogue 
republic are believed to number about 80,000. But the rising number of young, 
male Bosnian Serb refugees in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade suggests growing 
disenchantment with a rebellion that has so far brought only poverty, isolation 
and international scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees complained last week 
that Bosnian Serb refugees were being rounded up in Belgrade and pressed into 
service for the fight in Bosnia, a violation of international covenants that 
aim to protect refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Disgruntled rebel gunmen have increasingly been selling weapons and ammunition 
to earn money for basic necessities or to bribe their way out of the country, 
and much of the black-market weaponry is ending up in the hands of their 
enemies.

4 KILLED AFTER RUNNING CHECKPOINT

<P>
 Bosnian military police opened fire as a stolen aid vehicle sped through a 
checkpoint near Sarajevo on Monday, state TV said. Three gunmen and a hostage 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle was stolen Thursday from a British aid worker who was then slain, 
prompting Britain to halt aid shipments to Bosnia-Herzegovina for a few days 
and U.N. officials to say they would reassess their relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government investigators said Sunday that they had recovered a car the 
killers used and had suspects in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the driver of the car stolen from the British aid worker did not 
stop at a military police checkpoint and passengers opened fire with automatic 
weapons, state TV said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian soldiers killed the three gunmen and one civilian hostage riding in 
the car, the report said.

TURNABOUT: WHITE HOUSE STAFF TURNS CRITIC; TELEVISION COVERAGE IS SOMETHING OF 
A 'JOKE,' ONE SENIOR STAFFER SAYS. AS FOR NEWSPAPERS, THE FARTHER FROM THE 
CAPITAL THE BETTER, SURVEY FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Behind closed doors and away from the heat of the klieg lights, the senior 
officials around Bill Clinton admit they don't think much of the media who 
cover them. 
</P>
<P>
 They think television coverage of the presidency, as one adviser put it, is 
something of a "joke." Most prefer the coverage in out-of-town papers to that 
provided by the New York Times and Washington Post. And many believe that much 
of the press seems eager to destroy people and policies rather than provide 
objective coverage of either. The views are contained in an in-house survey of 
key top advisers conducted by members of the White House staff and obtained by 
the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-page report, assembled for the White House "Bulletin" newsletter, did 
not specify how many people were interviewed, only that it was "a sizable 
portion of the President's top advisers" and their deputies who work with the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, the media receive a passing grade for accuracy," the report said. 
But it went on to characterize that accuracy as "inconsistent . . . spotty" and 
said that the term "accuracy" applies at all only when the press is reporting 
basic facts. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the task that the modern media increasingly see as its more 
important role -- providing context and analysis -- insiders view the press as 
far less capable. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as they try to explain what (something) meant, or what we were trying 
to accomplish, they fall into the quicksand called 'Washington journalism,' " 
one official was quoted as saying. All of the quotations in the report are 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the findings of a survey conducted by the George Bush White 
House in early 1992, Clinton's advisers do not detect any ideological bias in 
the press. Most often, the media were described as "apolitical" and "middle of 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at least one senior official said that perception itself suggests "we 
share a similar outlook. . . . When you agree with people, you generally call 
them moderate, middle of the road or apolitical." 
</P>
<P>
 And one aide thought the press reflected the values of "the elite . . . the 
views, feelings, conventions of people who earn two, three and four times the 
median income." 
</P>
<P>
 "That works to our advantage on stories like NAFTA," the official said, 
referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, "and it clearly redounded 
to the President's disadvantage when he was raising taxes on the wealthiest 2% 
of Americans. . . . It came across in the reportage as if he was raising taxes 
across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 But most advisers see negativism, pack mentality and a fascination with 
"inside baseball" as the media's dominant fixations. 
</P>
<P>
 "All respondents" expressed "dismay over how those in the press exhibit 
limited creativity and seldom stray from the group conclusion" on what is the 
story of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general approach seems to be to figure out the issue . . . on which the 
White House appears to be most vulnerable and to make that the story," one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, that story is dictated by the New York Times, the Washington Post or 
the Wall Street Journal, and "many reporters -- particularly those at the 
Washington Post and New York Times -- are preoccupied with the power struggles 
on the inside, often at the expense of good reporting on the substance," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an eagerness in the press to pull down policies and people," the 
report added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been struck by the persistent efforts on the part of the press to try 
to get members of the White House staff to leak against each other," one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the senior staff tended to prefer newspapers based outside of 
Washington and farther removed from the political swirl: the Wall Street 
Journal, Knight Ridder newspapers and the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Television, however, was held nearly in contempt. "Television is a joke, and 
it is scary to think that this is the way many Americans get their news," one 
official said. "They always put some weird hype on the story that makes 
everybody around here shake their heads or, at times, laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 "They have great power but seem to spend more time trying to put together 
catchy phrases than they do working the White House," another official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most sensitive issue is the ranking of reporters. And the results 
may reflect more than the journalists' work. They may be colored by how White 
House staffers feel about a reporter on a personal basis or about a particular 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Being the favorite of an Administration may be a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a bit of a surprise, Brit Hume of ABC received the most favorable mentions 
as the best network correspondent," the report said. Hume is an outspoken 
conservative and is "credited by those in the White House press room as being 
the most difficult to work with. But senior officials say his reporting is the 
most accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bush White House, Hume tied as best with CNN's Charles Bierbauer. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's Andrea Mitchell was second in the survey. "As for the worst 
correspondent, CBS's Rita Braver edged out CNN's Jill Dougherty," but Braver is 
new to the beat and "again, quite a few names were mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
 For networks, ABC was first, NBC second, CNN ("the choice of the Bush White 
House"), dropping to third and CBS "the worst network . . . for two years in a 
row." 
</P>
<P>
 In print, "the Wall Street Journal's Jeff Birnbaum and the Los Angeles Times' 
David Lauter ran a statistical heat for the best newspaper reporters," in the 
minds of the senior staff. "Lauter, who was criticized by Bush officials during 
the '92 campaign for being pro-Clinton, was given high marks for the quality of 
his sources." Tom Friedman of the New York Times finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 For the worst newspaper reporter, "there were almost as many answers as there 
were respondents," though "the New York Posts' Deborah Orrin leads the pack." 
</P>
<P>
 The most mentioned reporter of the Bush years, as both best and worst, Ann 
Devroy of the Washington Post, gathered only two votes as best and only one as 
worst. "Devroy will emerge in time," one official is quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Among columnists, senior aides most often preferred E. J. Dionne of the 
Washington Post and William Safire of the New York Times. Votes for the worst 
columnists were too split to name a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Among newsweeklies, Time finished first, and its reporter Michael Duffy was 
named the best newsweekly reporter. Newsweek finished second, and U.S. News & 
World Report "trailed a distant third." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the worst newsweekly reporter, the field again was quite large, with 
two Newsweek reporters barely "winning:" Bob Cohn and Howard Fineman.

GUATEMALAN VOTERS OK ANTI-CORRUPTION AMENDMENTS

<P>
 Guatemalans voted out the Congress and Supreme Court in an anti-corruption 
referendum that drew fewer than one in five voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the referendum called by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said the 
low turnout showed the public did not support the proposed constitutional 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon called the turnout "unfortunate" but said the vote was nonetheless a 
defeat for the "enemies of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon, a former human rights lawyer, was named president by Congress last 
June after an attempt by former President Jorge Serrano to grab total power 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the new president is sincere in wanting to purge corrupt officials 
but that the referendum is really a farce in that many members of Congress 
might simply be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 16% of the country's 3.44 million eligible voters cast ballots in 
the referendum Sunday, according to an electoral official. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who voted, 370,044, or 83%, approved the 43 constitutional changes 
and the dismissal of Congress and the Supreme Court, the official said.

MANDELA'S CANDID TALK STUNS SOUTH AFRICAN WHITES; POLITICS: THE BLACK LEADER 
SCOLDS AFRIKANERS AS HYPOCRITES. HIS APPEALS TO THEIR GUILT AND SHAME 
APPARENTLY STRIKE A CHORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nelson Mandela went on the political offensive here in the heart of right-wing 
country Monday, administering a kind of shock therapy to a roomful of stunned 
white Afrikaners. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two hours, Mandela alternately mocked and scolded about 350 mostly 
white business and academic leaders invited by the town's business forum to a 
question-and-answer session with the man expected to become South Africa's 
first black president after democratic elections in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again, Mandela angrily accused the well-dressed audience of acting as 
hypocrites. He said they only complained about his party's economic proposals, 
especially state intervention in fiscal policies, because blacks stand to 
benefit for the first time, instead of just the white minority who were given 
special protection and privilege under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you say, you never complained about state intervention as long as it 
was a white government," he said. "Because it helped you. But now that the next 
government will be black, it is anathema to you." 
</P>
<P>
 And Mandela said Afrikaners hid behind their religion to justify the white 
supremacist policies of apartheid. The Afrikaners who devised and enforced the 
codified racism of apartheid insisted it was God's will, and they made the 
exploitation and abuse of blacks a tenet of their Dutch Reformed Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must stand ashamed, because your community used the name of God to 
justify the commission of evil," Mandela declared to the hushed room. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew most agitated when someone asked whether the ANC was prepared to break 
its longtime alliance with the country's Communist Party. He accused the 
questioner of "temerity" for even suggesting it, saying the two parties had 
"fought against a brutal system of racial oppression" since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who opposed the system were beaten, tortured, forced into exile and 
killed "by a government that professes to be Christian," he said. And 114 
blacks were killed in jail in 1992 "by police who profess to be Christian." 
</P>
<P>
 The Communists have "done none of these things," he said. "You, the 
Christians, have done the things I have told you." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela also complained that the continued pro-apartheid broadcasting of Radio 
Pretoria, an unlicensed right-wing radio station outside Pretoria that has 
defied repeated court orders to close, showed how little had changed in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whites are keeping quiet," he said testily. "That is what is wrong with 
this country. You don't speak up when it concerns your own flesh and blood. And 
you don't want to use the force against whites that you do against blacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Conceding that his party, the African National Congress, was "enemy No. 1" for 
most Afrikaners, Mandela offered the olive branch several times. But in the 
next breath, he declared that local whites wanted to keep the privileges they 
had, including preference for special training, farm credits and housing loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Potchefstroom, a bustling farm-belt town about a 90-minute drive southwest of 
Johannesburg, is known as a right-wing stronghold. It elected a member of the 
pro-apartheid Conservative Party to Parliament, and thousands of pistol-packing 
farmers converged here last May to launch their formal opposition to black rule 
under the umbrella group of the Afrikaner Volksfront. 
</P>
<P>
 A key demand of the front has been to create a Volkstaat, or autonomous white 
state, for Afrikaners in the post-apartheid South Africa. Although the would-be 
white homeland remains a right-wing dream, signs are tacked around the town 
welcoming visitors to the Volkstaat. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the hard-core right showed up at Mandela's meeting, and only a 
handful of people walked out. His candor clearly struck a chord: He won more 
applause at the end of his speech than he had at the beginning. And interviews 
with several people suggested his appeals to white guilt and shame had hit the 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ashamed as Christians," said Elza van Biljon, a fashion designer and 
manufacturer. "Of course we are. It's unreal what we've done in the past."

DRUG PRICE RISE MAY ADD PRESSURE FOR CONTROLS; HEALTH: COSTS SOAR FASTER THAN 
GENERAL INFLATION RATE. PRESIDENT INDICATES HE MAY COMPROMISE ON REGIONAL 
ALLIANCES, SPENDING CAPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite efforts by many leading pharmaceutical companies to moderate their 
price increases last year, wholesale drug prices rose 15.5 times faster than 
the general inflation rate at the manufacturing level in 1993, according to a 
Senate report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, which were disputed by the drug industry, are expected to 
increase pressure for government controls on drug prices. The development came 
as President Clinton reportedly signaled a willingness to compromise on two key 
elements of his health care reform plan: regional health alliances and overall 
spending caps. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, prices charged by drug manufacturers rose 3.1% -- the lowest increase 
in nearly three decades. The moderation has been attributed to voluntary 
efforts by the pharmaceutical companies to keep increases within the general 
rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the newly released analysis of drug pricing by the Senate Select Committee 
on Aging noted that, even though drug price inflation has cooled, the overall 
increase still was 15.5 times the inflation rate of 0.2% for all manufacturing 
prices in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The report cited a 21.3% price increase for Lozol, a diuretic manufactured by 
Rorer; 13.2% on Zovirax, a herpes drug by Burroughs; 12.4% on Lorcet Plus, a 
painkiller by UAD Labs; 12.4% on Thyrolar-1, a thyroid replacement by Forest, 
and 12% on Lortab, a painkiller by Whitby. 
</P>
<P>
 It identified UAD Labs, Rhone Poulenc, Alcon and Boots as the companies with 
the highest increases in the industry during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), chairman of the committee, said the report 
demonstrates a need for stricter government controls on the pharmaceutical 
industry under health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The findings of this report call into question the ability of the marketplace 
to contain drug prices," Pryor said. "It provides compelling evidence that 
Congress may need to consider more meaningful price restraints." 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton's health care reform proposal would give the government more 
leverage to discourage large drug price increases, the bill would not impose 
strict price controls. Pryor, a leading critic of the pharmaceutical industry, 
did not say what kinds of controls he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. accused Pryor of using the wrong 
benchmarks to measure drug price inflation. It noted that the increase in drug 
prices last year was the lowest since 1974, and compared favorably to a 5.4% 
increase in all health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, meantime, discussed his willingness to compromise on health care 
reform during a closed-door meeting with the nation's governors at the White 
House. According to those who attended, he did not say what changes he would 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President's flexibility on these items have become well known. 
</P>
<P>
 In his State of the Union address last week, the President indicated that the 
one principle on which he will refuse to compromise is that of universal 
coverage for all Americans. By offering to compromise on alliances and spending 
caps, he was responding to Republican criticism that alliances -- regional 
insurance pools -- would create an unwieldy, new bureaucracy and that prices 
cannot be controlled by imposing overall limits on spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the leader of a faction of lawmakers who support a 
government-financed, "single-payer" health care plan similar to the Canadian 
system warned that the White House is making a "very, very dangerous and wrong 
assumption" that it can take those liberal votes for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-payer plan -- the most radical of the health care reform proposals 
-- has 92 co-sponsors in the House. Although these 92 votes are considered 
crucial to passing the President's health care plan, the White House is 
concentrating on winning over lawmakers who support more conservative 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the President's advisers) have simply stopped talking to us. . . . 
There's a fundamental assumption being made up at the White House, which is a 
mistake, and that is that all the single-payer people are just waiting to jump 
on the President's bandwagon," Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) told a group of 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 45 single-payer supporters have also co-sponsored Clinton's plan, 
McDermott described it as nothing more than "political politeness." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, the League of Women Voters and the California-based Kaiser 
Family Foundation announced a $4.1-million nationwide education drive to 
provide "Straight Facts on Health Reform." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign will consist of television, radio and print advertising and 60 
town hall meetings throughout the country between now and the end of April. 
Four town hall meetings are planned in California.

PLAN TO REDIRECT U.S. SCHOOL FUNDS FALTERS; EDUCATION: CLINTON EFFORT TO 
CHANNEL MONEY TO DISTRICTS WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF POOR STUDENTS SPARKS DEBATE. 
LAWMAKERS SEEK TO PROTECT SUBURBAN AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's ambitious plan to channel more money toward 
school districts with large numbers of poor students is faltering and a glimpse 
of where it might be headed could come today at a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat to the initiative comes from middle-class districts that could lose 
federal funds that would be funneled instead, under the Administration's 
proposal, to those with high concentrations of poor children. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate will begin in earnest as a subcommittee of the House Committee on 
Education and Labor begins its review of the multibillion-dollar program, 
called Chapter 1, for educating economically disadvantaged elementary and 
secondary schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireworks are likely as representatives from urban and suburban districts 
fight to conserve every cent that their schools now receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the debate is virtually certain to reflect the trouble that two 
of the Clinton agenda's oft-preached principles -- getting results by 
concentrating money in selected areas and keeping middle-class interests firmly 
in mind -- face in Congress, where representatives traditionally look out for 
their own district's best interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the proposed program's complicated funding formula that awards 
money on a district-wide basis, individual schools with few poor children could 
receive money while schools with large percentages of poor students could get 
no money at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts failed in the 1970s to retarget the current program, which was 
created as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, to the poorest 
schools. But the Administration hopes enough members of Congress can now be 
persuaded to vote for the legislation -- which it contends is for the "overall 
good" -- even though their districts might lose money, said Mike Smith, an 
assistant secretary of the Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one expects the task to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from both sides of the aisle -- including Rep. Dale E. Kildee 
(D-Mich.), chairman of the subcommittee on elementary, secondary and vocational 
education -- are lining up behind an alternate proposal that would protect the 
status quo and use a new formula only for allocating the $700-million funding 
increase that the Administration is seeking for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the alternative plan argue that the Administration's proposal is 
unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The net effect of the Administration's proposal is to increase federal 
funding for high-spending, urban school districts," said Rep. Thomas E. Petri 
(R-Wis.), one of the leaders of the campaign against the Administration's 
proposal. Petri said that his district would lose between 40% and 50% of the 
funding it now receives, if the Administration's version is passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why slash us in order to shovel more money at the big city districts?" Petri 
asked. "It's Robin Hood in reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith said that the alternative proposal "is biased against the cities" 
because, although it favors districts with large percentages of poor children, 
it does not help districts with large numbers of poor children, as the 
Administration's proposal and the current formula do. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent research, the Administration argues, makes it clear that the current 
formula has supported a two-tiered education system in the country -- providing 
a challenging academic curriculum for middle-class children and a watered-down 
remedial curriculum for poor children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kildee-Petri version of the legislation would not change the funding 
mechanism enough to alter this two-track system, Smith argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, the poorest quarter of the nation's counties, which educate 
45% of the poor children, receive 43.4% of all Chapter 1 money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's proposal would increase that to 46.7% next year and to 
almost 50% by 1998. The Kildee-Petri formula would increase it to 43.6%.

 Democrat Joel Hyatt began his U.S. Senate campaign, undaunted that he could be 
hurt by the movie "Philadelphia," which has brought attention to his firm's 
firing of an AIDS-infected lawyer.Hyatt is seeking to replace his 
father-in-law, Democratic Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, who is retiring. The film 
was inspired by dozens of cases, including one involving Hyatt's firm, the 
film's publicist said. Clarence Cain, a senior attorney with Hyatt Legal 
Services in Philadelphia, was fired seven years ago after he learned he had 
AIDS. He sued for discrimination and won $157,000 in 1990. He died two months 
later.

WITNESS SAYS BECKWITH WAS INTRODUCED AS EVERS' KILLER; COURT: SUSPECT ON TRIAL 
FOR THE THIRD TIME IN THE 1963 SLAYING PURPORTEDLY REFERRED TO THE BLACK CIVIL 
RIGHTS LEADER AS A 'CHICKEN-STEALING DOG.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM BOOTH, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Ann Adams told jurors Monday how Byron De La Beckwith was introduced to 
her as "the man who killed Medgar Evers," the civil rights leader shot to death 
three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After the bookkeeper refused to shake his hand, Beckwith told her "he had not 
killed a man," Adams testified Monday, "but a damn chicken-stealing dog -- and 
you know what you have to do when a dog has tasted blood." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in the historic retrial of Beckwith, 73, the jury of eight 
blacks and four whites heard witnesses describe how Beckwith boasted 
enigmatically of killing Evers, the former field secretary of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors also listened to Beckwith's nephew, Reed Massengill, describe his 
uncle's virulent brand of racism, his joy at President John F. Kennedy's 
killing and his suspicion that adding fluoride to drinking water was a plot by 
Jews to make the populace more "docile." 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries of white men failed to reach a verdict when Beckwith stood trial 
for the Evers killing in 1964, but prosecutors here succeeded in reopening the 
case after new witnesses came forward telling tales of Beckwith's veiled 
admissions of the crime and his presence in Jackson the night Evers was shot 
outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith, however, has steadfastly stated that he was 90 miles away in 
Greenwood the night Evers was killed, and two retired Greenwood police officers 
are expected to take the stand again and swear that Beckwith was there when 
Evers was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous testimony has shown that Beckwith's 1917 Enfield rifle with one of 
his fingerprints was found outside Evers' home, and a parade of FBI agents -- 
active and retired -- have testified that the bullet shot at Evers, now lost, 
was probably from the rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith has stated that his rifle was stolen before the slaying.

when he tried to enter the country with a fake Swedish passport in September, 
1992. He was serving a six-month prison sentence for illegally entering the

1ST U.S. SHUTTLE FLIGHT WITH RUSSIAN BEGINS COUNTDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA began the countdown Monday for the first U.S. shuttle flight with a 
Russian cosmonaut, a seasoned spaceman who will share orbital duties with an 
older yet less experienced American crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground crews began a three-day countdown before dawn for Discovery's liftoff 
at 4:10 a.m. PST Thursday with a crew of six. 
</P>
<P>
 The cosmonaut, Sergei Krikalev, smiled broadly as Discovery's pilot praised 
him as "a man of many talents." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to keep him busy on this flight," pilot Kenneth Reightler Jr. 
promised after arriving at Kennedy Space Center with the rest of the six-member 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission specialists for the flight are Franklin Chang-Diaz, Jan Davis and Ron 
Sega. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day science mission will be only the second time Americans and 
Russians have flown together in space. The first was the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz 
docking. 
</P>
<P>
 Krikalev, 35, already has spent 463 days in space, nine times longer than the 
rest of the shuttle crew combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other person, cosmonaut Musa Manarov, has logged more space time. 
</P>
<P>
 Krikalev also is a champion aerobatic pilot, mechanical engineer and computer 
whiz who showed commander Charles Bolden Jr. a better way to use the shuttle's 
laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Krikalev and his backup, Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Titov, have been 
treated as full-fledged crew members since arriving at the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration in late 1992. Titov, 47, who's spent 368 days in 
space, is scheduled to fly on a shuttle early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cosmonaut shuttle flights are part of an agreement between the United 
States and Russia that also calls for five American astronauts to orbit on 
Russia's space station Mir beginning next year. Up to 10 shuttle-Mir dockings 
are planned, followed in 1997 by construction of a joint space station.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; REVIVAL OF STATE QUAKE INSURANCE PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation calling for revival of a state-run earthquake insurance program 
for homeowners was introduced Monday in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are learning the hard way that repealing the old program was a mistake," 
said Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose), the bill's author. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake insurance program was repealed in 1993 after critics claimed 
that it was bordering on insolvency. If the program had been in place when the 
Northridge quake hit, Areias said, it would have contained about $350 million, 
enough to provide 60,000 to 70,000 Los Angeles homeowners with checks for 
$5,000 or more each. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposed prepaid recovery program would provide homeowners with up to 
$13,000, after a $2,000 deductible, to repair homes damaged by earthquakes, 
Areias said. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a mandatory insurance program and cost the average homeowner $25 
to $75 annually, the amount varying depending on seismic zones, the value of 
the property and the type of structure. Homeowners who failed to pay would face 
a secondary or non-foreclosable lien on their property. Mobil homes and 
condominiums would not be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 County tax collectors would collect the fees. The state Department of Housing 
and Community Affairs would administer the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earthquakes in California are inevitable," Areias said, "and it is 
intelligent public policy to plan ahead for the disaster we know will occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the previous program contended that California, despite its size, 
is not large enough to adequately fund such a repair program and that the state 
is misleading the public into a false sense of security over what the state can 
provide in the event of a major quake. The answer lies in a nationally based 
insurance program, the critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the insurance industry said Monday it has no position on 
Areias' bill, but prefers the national approach, which would cover all types of 
disasters, including damage by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and 
volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Norman Mineta (D-San Jose) has introduced such a bill in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We favor a national approach for two reasons," said Tim Hart of the Assn. of 
California Insurance Companies. "First, there is not enough capacity in 
California to absorb the kind of losses that would be created by a catastrophic 
quake. Secondly, the federal government is obligated to pay its debts and can 
print money."

LOCKYER ELECTED TO SUCCEED ROBERTI AS LEADER OF SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) was unanimously elected state Senate leader 
Monday, succeeding David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) who had served as Senate 
president pro tem for more than 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted 39 to 0 to pick the moderate-to-liberal Lockyer after 
Democrats and the Senate's two independents rejected a GOP effort to install 
Republican Ken Maddy in the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer promised to bring a "slightly different policy emphasis" to the Senate 
leader's job and to "push a little harder . . . for creative solutions to the 
challenges facing our state." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what our constituents all expect," he said. "I hope I can respond to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 He announced that he will expand the Senate's workweek by convening the 
chamber on Monday mornings instead of Monday afternoons and will urge senators 
to get to sessions on time. The Senate is well-known for routinely starting its 
meetings at least 20 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Rob Hurtt, (R-Garden Grove), who has urged a more partisan stance by 
Republican lawmakers, was the only senator who refused to vote for Lockyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti indicated several months ago that he planned to step down early this 
year to focus on his campaign for state treasurer. He is also trying to fend 
off a recall effort backed by several gun groups.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FOOD STAMP CHEATERS ANGER THOSE IN NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Because of the food stamp cheats, Lydia Sanchez and her four children have 
survived on food donated by local churches while waiting in long lines for food 
stamps to be issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Panorama City welfare office Monday, Sanchez and about 1,500 other 
earthquake victims -- many without food or a place to sleep -- were told by 
county employees using bullhorns to communicate in Spanish, English and 
Armenian that there was now a waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheats, they told those in the crowd, beat them to their food stamps last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people who suffered losses in the quake were granted emergency 
food vouchers the day they applied last week. But because of suspicions that 
many of the applications were fraudulent, a 72-hour waiting period was 
instituted to give county workers time to verify claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who was doing wrong got what they wanted, and now the ones who are 
honest and really need it have to wait for three days," said Sanchez, of North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez was among many in line Monday who were frustrated because they had 
waited in line last week, they were waiting again this week and, after filling 
out their applications, they will wait three more days for their vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 She waited in line all day last Tuesday with her children without obtaining 
any vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Carter, who applied for food stamps for the first time on Monday, is 
living in a friend's motor home. His Van Nuys apartment was condemned after the 
earthquake and he lost his job as a customer service worker when his work site 
was heavily damaged. He blamed government officials for failing to prevent the 
fraud last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't that what computers are for?" Carter said. "It seems to me that the 
government ought to be able to check people pretty quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say they are now vigorously pursuing food-stamp cheats and 
one suspect was arraigned Monday in federal court. Four other suspects are 
scheduled to be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people in line Monday said some ineligible people were circumventing 
the application process by buying others' food stamp vouchers. Tricia Hendrix 
of Van Nuys said a man offered her a voucher for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people in line have been very understanding," said Bryce Yokomizo, East 
Valley District director for the Los Angeles County Department of Social 
Services. "But many of the people in line have been complaining about those who 
abuse the system." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Angel Pastrana of Northridge, an unemployed father of six, said he 
was sickened by the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had to depend on the state for anything until now, and I'm proud 
of that," he said. "Don't these people have any pride? How could they take 
handouts from the state when they don't need them?" 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 people also waited in line at Dodger Stadium Monday, one of 
four large processing centers county officials opened in the hopes of avoiding 
the mass confusion of last week. There were extremely long lines last week at 
the 29 county welfare offices and numerous tales of abuse as about 50,000 
people applied for the emergency food vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, county officials tried to rectify the situation by establishing 
centralized application centers and steering applicants away from some of the 
overburdened county welfare offices. And by verifying claims, officials hoped 
to keep the cheats away. 
</P>
<P>
 Although people still waited at Dodger Stadium and other sites on Monday, the 
processing program had fewer hitches than last week. The lines at the large 
centers moved quicker, there were more employees to handle the paperwork and 
there was a large police presence to keep order. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still glitches that need to be addressed, said Lew Hollman, an 
attorney for San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services. The elderly and 
disabled are forced to wait in long lines, in the hot sun, and the county has 
made no special provisions for them. And, he said, none of those who filled out 
the food stamp forms were given any paperwork to verify that they had applied. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could lead to major problems," Hollman said. "If 1,000 applications are 
lost, what happens to those people. Does that mean they've lost the chance to 
obtain any food stamps?" 
</P>
<P>
 Within 72 hours of making a claim, applicants are supposed to be notified by 
mail that they can pick up their vouchers, which are provided through a U. S. 
Department of Agriculture program that is being managed by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are a number of precautions officials are taking to prevent fraud. 
Every application will be cross-checked by the county's central computer 
system, said Mike Collins, a division chief for the county Department of Public 
Social Services. If people attempt to apply for the emergency food vouchers a 
second time or if they claim more dependents than the last time they applied 
for county benefits, their cases will be referred to fraud investigators.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; VALLEY SLOWLY REGAINS ITS BALANCE; RECOVERY: 
POSITIVE SIGNS SHOW RESIDENTS ARE GETTING BACK ON THEIR FEET. VICTIMS IN TENT 
CITIES ARE DWINDLING, WHILE THE NUMBER SEEKING ASSISTANCE LEVELS OFF.

<P>
 Even as government officials Monday increased the cost of the Northridge 
quake, and victims still grappled with federal aid problems, optimistic signs 
appeared indicating that the San Fernando Valley was slowly beginning to return 
to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department canceled full emergency mobilization, with 
its 12-hour workdays, and returned to eight-hour shifts. Detectives went back 
to the routine business of solving crimes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of quake victims seeking federal financial assistance appeared to 
have leveled off, and tent cities set up to house them were becoming emptier by 
the hour, state and federal disaster officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Residents have determined they would rather be somewhere else," said Mike 
Allen, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "They want to 
get back home, and if that isn't possible, better accommodations are available 
at shelters and elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some quake victims continued expressing complaints over government aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge student Jose Vela buttonholed FEMA Director James Lee 
Witt on Monday as Witt toured the Red Cross' new "super service center" in 
Northridge. Visibly anxious, Vela said he was unable to find a landlord willing 
to accept the temporary housing voucher that he received from the U. S. Housing 
and Urban Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't found anything," Vela told the head of the nation's disaster 
response agency. "They won't accept the certificates." 
</P>
<P>
 Witt, clad in jeans and cowboy boots, told Vela that he would speak with HUD 
Secretary Henry Cisneros about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, the FEMA director said he and Cisneros already are aware of 
potential problems with uncooperative apartment owners, but he did not know if 
the problem is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them are" accepting the certificates, Witt said. "I don't know if all 
of them are." 
</P>
<P>
 Witt contended, however, that the successes in the governmental response to 
the nation's costliest disaster have far outweighed the failures. "I'm not 
saying we didn't have problems early," Witt said, "but we have acted quickly to 
fix them." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as he made his way through the vast white tent housing the Red Cross 
super center at the corner of Tampa Avenue and Plummer Street, Witt was met by 
many who were glad to have the government's help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody from FEMA has been incredible," Ken Field, a disabled 40-year-old 
whose Canoga Park home was nearly destroyed, told Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 At an impromptu news conference, Witt announced that well over 210,000 
applications for disaster relief were processed in the first 10 days after the 
Northridge earthquake -- equaling the number of those applying for aid in the 
first six months after Hurricane Andrew, the previous most costly American 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very large disaster," Witt said. "And every time there's an 
aftershock, we find there's a little more damage." 
</P>
<P>
 As aftershocks and damage reports continue, the Administration is boosting its 
request for federal aid to $8.6 billion, surpassing the $8.5 billion spent 
jointly on aid for Hurricane Andrew in Florida, Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and 
Typhoon Omar. Last summer's Midwest floods cost about $4.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt said FEMA already has cut $59 million worth of checks to help quake 
victims with housing and other assistance. But still, he acknowledged, there 
are many others just now coming forward to ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, faced with still-rising damage estimates, the Clinton Administration 
plans to ask Congress for an additional $2 billion in housing, small business 
and other federal aid for victims of the Northridge earthquake -- including 
another $1.2 billion for FEMA, Administration officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as $1 billion of that could go toward paying for the rapidly growing 
costs of the Jan. 17 quake, which killed 61 people and produced damage that may 
total $30 billion, administration and congressional officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers of those seeking federal assistance may soon start to decline, 
Witt said, because "we're noticing our applications are starting to peak." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The first contract for reconstruction of damaged freeway bridges was let for 
$14.8 million, and officials predicted the work on the Golden State Freeway in 
the Gavin Canyon area would be completed by early June. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of Emergency Services, said 
208,844 people have applied for temporary rental assistance, and FEMA has 
responded by mailing 12,831 checks totaling $39,398,801. More than 7,300 
applicants have applied for Small Business Administration loans, and 
$16,779,800 has been disbursed. And 112,783 applicants have asked for emergency 
food stamps, and the government has issued $25,477,295 worth already, Andrews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fourteen schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District reopened after 
two weeks of structural inspections. At least 21 quake-damaged schools in the 
sprawling district remain closed, but officials said some of those campuses 
will reopen later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council's Budget and 
Finance Committee, estimated that the city will lose at least $33 million in 
revenue as a result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman said utility tax revenues will drop because of power outages, 
closed businesses and destroyed homes. Property taxes will drop because of 
reduced property values. Municipal Court fines will dip because police officers 
-- diverted to other duties -- are not writing as many traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, damage to retail businesses will reduce the city's share 
of sales taxes, business taxes will drop accordingly and hesitancy in 
purchasing real estate will trim documentary transfer tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before the earthquake, we were facing an approximately $150-million 
shortfall for the 1994-95 fiscal year," Yaroslavsky said. "With an additional 
$33-million loss, we are looking at a very serious money problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * Lucy Jones, a seismologist for the U. S. Geological Survey, said the area 
was averaging two or three aftershocks of magnitude 3.0 or greater a day -- 
compared to 150 on the day of the quake. She predicted that the aftershocks 
would continue to taper off in frequency and strength, although warning that 
there could be another 5.0 in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Building and Safety Department said 43,449 structures had been 
inspected by midday Monday, with a total of 26,920 dwelling units declared 
unsafe for occupancy. The Red Cross said 4,177 people were still being housed 
in 30 indoor shelters and an additional 518 were camping in tents pitched 
outside the shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army sheltered 492 indoors in one shelter and an additional 382 
in two tent camps erected by the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department, confronted with the problem of trying to 
keep people out of buildings that have been declared unsafe, announced that it 
has drafted a policy for arresting anyone who persists in repeatedly returning 
to those structures. 
</P>
<P>
 But detectives for the first time were returning to solving a backlog of cases 
put on hold during the quake, and patrol officers once again were responding to 
more than just life-threatening calls, as mandated under the disaster 
mobilization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're returning to business as usual," said Lt. Bob Warren, acting head 
of detectives in West Valley Division, where much of the quake damage occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Red Cross centers and even in the schools, many were struggling to gain 
some semblance of normalcy in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Red Cross super center -- so called because it provides up to four 
times as many claim processors as other centers -- workers were still busy 
providing victims with vouchers to buy food, clothing, health and medical aid, 
temporary housing and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 By giving them vouchers that they can use wherever they choose, "people can 
take control of their own lives," said Red Cross spokesman Randy Ackley. "It 
gets them back into a routine. It helps the local merchants too." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants can redeem the vouchers through the Red Cross. Ackley said the 
relief agency expects to spend at least $31.4 million to help quake victims. 
The super center, which was opened Saturday to alleviate overcrowding at other 
Red Cross centers, was set up to handle as many as 1,000 earthquake victims per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon Monday, it had processed 446 people seeking vouchers to cover 
rent, food, clothing and even appliances lost in the quake. "It's not been 
overwhelming," said Jean Reynolds, a volunteer from Orange County, "but it's 
been steadily busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Valley, children returned to school. Students at Canoga Park 
Elementary School met with a psychologist to discuss their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did anyone have animals that went real weird?" asked psychologist Robert 
Butterworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hamster hid under his hay," said one youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hamster was smart," said the psychologist. "He knew enough to get under 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Life for commuters continued to be a challenge, but there were signs that 
struggle was easing up a bit too. Metrolink officials said a new station on the 
Los Angeles-to-Lancaster line opened at Acton as scheduled Monday, with another 
new station expected to open in Santa Clarita this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Stanger, Metrolink's executive director, said station platforms in 
Sylmar and Burbank have been lengthened to accommodate the longer trains that 
have run since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest figures, the death toll remained at 61. A total of 
7,757 have been treated and released from hospitals, with another 1,496 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 In quake-affected areas, about 42,000 buildings have been inspected. Of those, 
18,900 have been deemed inhabitable, 6,300 partially inhabitable and 2,700 
uninhabitable, according to the state Office of Emergency Services. But many 
remain to be inspected. FEMA officials estimate 45,319 residences were damaged 
or destroyed.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE LOSS AT CSUN MAY REACH $350 MILLION; 
EDUCATION: CAMPUS OFFICIALS EXPECT TO RECOUP MOST OF THE EXPENSE FROM STATE AND 
FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Earthquake damage to the Cal State Northridge campus may reach as high as $350 
million, school officials said Monday, an estimate that would make it one of 
the largest losses yet incurred by any public institution in Southern 
California due to the destructive Jan. 17 temblor.  
</P>
<P>
 The figure is many times the tens-of-millions range that university officials 
offered shortly after a 6.6-magnitude earthquake that was centered nearby 
rocked Southern California. Although university officials as yet have not been 
able to tally a precise accounting, CSUN Vice President of Administration 
Elliot Mininberg said the $250- to $350-million range was his best guess based 
on an assessment of the campus. Cal State University Chancellor Barry Munitz 
and other state officials have been discussing similar figures. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said they expect to recoup most of their losses from 
federal and state disaster relief as well as some possible assistance from the 
Cal State system and state Legislature. But CSUN officials acknowledged that 
they do not yet know what portion of the loss they will have to absorb. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Bentley-Adler, a spokeswoman for the 20-campus state university 
system, said she believed that the earthquake losses at Northridge are the most 
substantial to any campus in the system's history. None of the other Cal State 
campuses in Southern California suffered any significant earthquake damage, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of CSUN remained without electricity, natural gas or water service 
Monday. University officials after the quake deliberately shut off the 
utilities to prevent further damage from broken pipes and other structural 
problems. Most of the university's more than 2,000 faculty and other employees 
remained at home on paid administrative leave, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 University spokesman Bruce Erickson said the campus plans to reopen Feb. 14, 
two weeks late, with most classes and offices likely to be held in 250 to 350 
modular classrooms that the university has ordered. The first such classroom 
was being set up Monday, although truck delivery of the units was being slowed 
by high winds, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only building on campus that has been declared a total loss thus far is 
the four-level, $15-million Parking Structure C that was heavily damaged in the 
original earthquake and then collapsed further in an aftershock. As for other 
buildings, Erickson said, "I don't know of any plans to tear anything down 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's latest review of its major buildings listed the following as partly or 
entirely unstable and closed: 
</P>
<P>
 The five-story administration building, the fine arts building, the south 
library building housing much of the university's computer operations, building 
12 of the University Park Apartments and the theater building of the University 
Student Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oviatt Library, the campus' most distinctive building, which houses more 
than 1 million books, will require asbestos abatement and some demolition work 
to remove unstable areas. The science complex suffered chemical and biological 
contamination and a fire. And crews Monday worked to remove the unstable south 
stairwell of the Sierra Tower complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Kepner, a Pasadena-based spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, said public agencies that suffered damage in the quake will be eligible 
for 100% reimbursement for their initial outlays, and then 90% for subsequent 
expenditures. But because of the numerous aftershocks, trying to sort out those 
figures will be difficult, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of disaster relief officials is due to survey the CSUN campus this week 
to make a more detailed assessment of the cost of the quake damage, said state 
Office of Emergency Services spokeswoman Lisa Covington. Similarly, CSUN 
President Blenda J. Wilson has asked her staff to prepare more detailed 
numbers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Days after the earthquake, CSUN officials talked of damages in the tens of 
millions. At a Cal State Board of Trustees meeting last week, Munitz gave a 
$150-million estimate, then told reporters over the weekend that the number had 
risen to $200 million. By today, the estimate had risen again to the range 
offered by Mininberg.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE'S SHAKING SET SOME THINGS RIGHT; NATURE: 
MANY SAY THE TEMBLOR FIXED ITEMS THAT WERE BROKEN, INCLUDING A BALKY COPY 
MACHINE. ONE MAN'S BACK STOPPED HURTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the havoc it wrought, all the rubble it left behind, the Northridge 
quake also fixed a few things. 
</P>
<P>
 A broken wall clock, for example, that began ticking after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," said Sheila Shaler, whose Chatsworth home suffered heavy damage. 
"I have a Westminster chime clock and it hadn't been running for six months. It 
really startled me when it chimed." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other reports of resurrection by rock and roll. A chronically 
jammed door in Hollywood now swings freely. A Hermosa Beach car radio lost its 
irritating buzz. These and other such instances supplied quirky justification 
for that time-honored home remedy: If something doesn't work, jiggle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Shaler said of her clock, "I think the earthquake shook the 
you-know-what out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, such minor miracles pale in comparison to the billions of dollars 
in damages. In the past two weeks, appliance shops have been overwhelmed with 
requests to replace everything from shattered oven doors to torn water-heater 
pipes. Scores of televisions and computers required attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is human nature to search for silver linings. A bright side to each 
horrific event. A troublesome photocopier that now performs without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the feeder, the thing that feeds paper into the machine," said Robert 
Manuwal, a Ventura Boulevard attorney in Tarzana. "I had a copier guy coming 
every other day and he couldn't fix it. Now it works fine. It's really 
strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Strange, but not unexpected. Repairmen say that quake-inflicted repairs often 
involve electrical contact points that have fallen out of alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever had a flashlight that didn't work and, if you shook it, you 
could get it to switch on?" asked Scott Kassner, general manager of a North 
Hills appliance store. He explained that shaking sometimes causes contact 
points to reunite. "You make just enough of a circuit for the power to flow 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing may have happened, on a widespread scale, during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the repairs were mechanical, though. Phillip Frazier of Cerritos had 
suffered from an aching back for 10 years. "It hurt him every morning he woke 
up," said his wife, Shirley. Every morning, that is, until the Monday before 
last. Since the earthquake, he has felt no pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks maybe the shaking of the bed shook something into place in his 
back," his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaking adjusted much larger structures. Rigid plates that compose the 
Earth's outer shell were suffering from a good deal of strain before the quake 
provided relief. Crooked house frames were similarly jarred into alignment. 
Marty Brastow of Topanga Canyon reports that the crack in her front porch, 
opened by a previous quake, has now closed considerably. She can tell because 
kitty litter from the cat box on the porch no longer gets stuck in the crack. 
</P>
<P>
 In other homes, doors and windows that had been sticking now open. For 
homeowners who suffered the reverse -- jammed doors -- there may be hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people to wait till the next one and maybe it will straighten itself 
out," said John Smith, who owns a Los Angeles carpentry service. "Nature works 
in funny ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Its effects also extend beyond the purely practical. For the past year, artist 
Kilgore Bohorquez has been hard at work in a West Hills garage, assembling a 
massive piece that blends classical sculpture with the clutter of debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole garage settled and shifted," Bohorquez said, explaining that his 
artwork suffered partial damage but, in the process, became aesthetically 
complete. "The earthquake added a finishing touch. It added an element that I 
love, the element of spontaneity. There's no way I can be as spontaneous as an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 And the picture quality of his aging color television set improved to boot, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But earthquake-caused repairs may prove short-lived. Reunited contact points 
are likely to shift out of touch again. Pendulum clocks that were given a 
jump-start by the shaking will probably run down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Coffey, a Granada Hills clock repairman, says it reminds him of a radio 
evangelist who broadcast in Bakersfield during the 1950s. The evangelist 
claimed to repair broken watches if listeners would lay the watches atop their 
radios during his show. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did this when the weather was cold. People didn't realize that some 
watches don't work in cold weather, the grease gets too hard inside," Coffey 
said. "When his hour show was over, the watches were all warmed up and running. 
But they eventually stopped. It's the same with clocks that were fixed in the 
earthquake. They'll only work for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaler's clock, alas, stopped ticking several days ago. But while clearing 
broken glass and the rubble of fallen chimneys, she can take small comfort from 
the unusual silence in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My refrigerator used to sound like a small diesel truck," she said. "A 
repairman came out twice before the earthquake and said the sound was normal. 
Now it's purring like a kitten."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; PROPERTY DAMAGE TOTALS $31.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of San Fernando estimates it suffered $31.5 million in private 
property damage after the Jan. 17 earthquake, including potentially crippling 
blows to 63 buildings and serious damage to 835 others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a lot of damage," City Administrator Mary Strenn said after 
releasing the first official figures Monday."But when you look at our city 
compared to communities like Northridge, we came out OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the private property damage, San Fernando suffered $1.2 million in 
damage to public facilities and infrastructure, according to the estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the public-sector damage, about $800,000, came from burst water 
mains, said Strenn.  
</P>
<P>
 Although businesses suffered from the quake, the bulk of the city's 
private-sector monetary damage -- $29 million -- came in residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 63 buildings declared unsafe, 44 were residential; of the 835 where 
limited access is allowed, 784 were residential. The loss of residential units 
hits San Fernando's population hard -- an average of 4.4 people occupy each 
rental unit in San Fernando, compared to an average tenant density of 2.6 
valleywide, according to 1990 U. S. Census Bureau statistics.  
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando will seek help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
recoup its infrastructure losses, but should be able to get by on budget 
reserves, said Strenn. GEOFFREY MOHAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; ANTIQUE ROW IS HARD HIT AS BRICKS FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although earthquake damage was relatively light in Canoga Park, the Jan. 17 
temblor took a toll on what some consider the community's best asset -- the 
Sherman Way antique district. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every building has been condemned in the antique mall on Sherman Way 
between De Soto Avenue and Topanga Canyon Boulevard. More than a dozen antique 
shops in the area have been forced to close, and numerous vendors and 
cooperatives who rented space within them are also out of business, said Stan 
Goldman, owner of Turn of the Century Antiques and a founding merchant of 
"Antique Row." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the shops were housed in one two-story brick building. Other stores 
occupied neighboring older brick structures. The brick buildings gave Antique 
Row both character and fragility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brick is brick, and brick moves," said Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The antique merchants will meet this week to discuss options. Hopefully, that 
won't mean moving out of the area, Goldman said. But many antique vendors may 
not have the luxury of waiting until the buildings are fixed, and may choose to 
relocate, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, it would be bad news for Canoga Park, which has relied on 
antique shops to help preserve its retail shopping core. At a time when 
outlying malls were draining the area of viable businesses, antiques came in 
and filled the gap. The process, which took nearly 20 years, may have been 
reversed in a single night by the quake, Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time, downtown Canoga Park was dying. Antiques really brought it back 
to life again," he said. "It's like a little family -- we would like to keep it 
together." The damage to Antique Row is a blow to community leaders, who fear a 
neighborhood decline without it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very dismal as far as businesses goes," said Aline Hausman, executive 
director of the local Chamber of Commerce. "We were hurting already." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Canoga Park, businesses were resuming normal operations. The two 
closest malls, Topanga Plaza and Fallbrook Mall, have partially reopened. 
Topanga Plaza's parking lots were filled over the weekend as shoppers returned 
to the damaged mall. JILL LEOVY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; EARTHQUAKE DEALS SETBACK TO ARTS DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as North Hollywood had set its sights on an economic recovery, spurred by 
the proposed NoHo Arts District and a revamped Laurel Plaza Mall, the 
Northridge earthquake has shaken the community's dreams as easily as it rattled 
the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show must go on. "It's going to take a lot more than this to put us 
out of business," said Dan Hirsch, owner of NoHo Studios at Lankershim and 
Magnolia boulevards, which has been red-tagged. "We expect we'll be back up and 
running in three to four weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jim Mahfet, executive director of the Universal City/North 
Hollywood Chambers of Commerce, the quake forced dozens of small businesses and 
several large commercial enterprises temporarily out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Plaza Mall on Oxnard Street was perhaps the hardest hit. A spokeswoman 
said structural damage could force all but one of the mall's 33 stores -- 
Robinsons-May -- to remain closed for one to two months.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the damage, a spokesman for mall owner Forest City Development said 
the firm plans to continue to seek city approval of a proposed $150-million 
renovation plan for the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley Plaza, an outdoor mall on Victory Boulevard, it will be at least two 
months before screenings resume at the United Artists Theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovated El Portal Theatre, which was supposed to begin its first 
production this Saturday, suffered about $1 million in damage and has been 
declared unsafe. Bob Caine, managing director of the theater, could not 
estimate the time it would take to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Renegade Theatre on Magnolia Boulevard lost one of its two stages 
during the quake, and its next production will be produced at the West End 
Theater in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how long it's going to take to repair the damage because FEMA 
and the Small Business Administration does not loan money to theaters," said 
David Cox, executive director of American Renegade. He estimated damage at 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Both theaters were considered linchpins in the plan to revitalize a portion of 
North Hollywood into the NoHo Arts District. The proposal would allow artists 
to set up galleries, studios and other businesses in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caine and others insist that the setbacks will be only temporary. "It's a 
way to test your mettle," said Caine. "If you are really committed to what you 
want to do, you find a way." JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; SOME REGAINING PRE-QUAKE RHYTHM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than any place in the San Fernando Valley, it was Northridge, home to the 
quake's epicenter, that received the bulk of the press coverage after the 
quake. The photos of the shattered Bullock's department store at Northridge 
Fashion Center and the Northridge Meadows apartment complex have become the 
defining images of this disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all in Northridge are willing to accept this notoriety. Despite vivid 
examples of devastation covered on the news, life for many has regained 
something similar to its pre-quake rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a cousin in Florida who keeps wanting to send me care packages!" 
laughed Gloria Rothenberg, past North Valley Homeowners' Assn. president, whose 
house is standing firm. "I keep trying to tell her there's no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Prince, president of a Northridge building maintenance firm, and 
land-use chairman for the Chamber of Commerce, said the press images may have 
given an unrealistic perception of how widespread the damage really is. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homes and businesses escaped with little damage beyond broken windows, 
cracked chimneys and fallen block walls, he said. And despite devastating 
losses to many, Northridge is fortunate that it is home to a high concentration 
of construction-related businesses and contracting firms, many of which are 
thriving in the post-quake economy, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the quake, for example, Northridge Lumber did a week's worth 
of business in a single day, said Pat Hawthorne, president and part owner of 
the firm. Still, many seeking a silver lining have had to look pretty hard. 
Northridge Chamber President Jim Beal said he has been discouraged by the 
number of people he has talked to who are making plans to leave town. 
</P>
<P>
 Beal, his voice strained, said his home suffered severe damage and his law 
firm was obliterated. "I don't have any place to hang my hat," he said. 
Earthquake damage, the temporary closure of Cal State Northridge, which 
provides a customer base for many small businesses, and job-loss due to the 
closure of the mall, may put many small, marginal shops out of business, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Beal said he sees hope in the fact that many badly damaged businesses, 
including the area's grocery stores, seemed to have rebounded quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angelenos have always had short memories," said maintenance firm owner 
Prince. "I'm not gloomy. We have seen earthquakes before. They come, and they 
go away." JILL LEOVY

TARZANA MAN IS CHARGED IN TATTOOING OF TEEN-AGE GIRL; LAW: THE CASE MAY BE THE 
FIRST TIME THAT THE PROHIBITION IS INVOKED LOCALLY. A CITY ATTORNEY SAYS YOUTH 
WAS TOLD IT WOULD WASH OFF. 
</P>

<P>
 In what may be the first local use of the law banning the tattooing of minors, 
prosecutors have charged a Tarzana man with tattooing a 16-year-old girl who 
mistakenly thought the artwork could be washed off. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office on Friday charged Edward Flores, 27, with placing a 
tattoo of a rose on the right arm of Rebecca Bateman, a 10th-grade student who 
lives in Flores' apartment building on Clark Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess what she thought is he was writing it with a pen," said Deputy City 
Atty. Martha A. Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred New Year's Eve in Flores' apartment, according to 
authorities, who said Flores put temporary tattoos on several other people 
during the same gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked him if it would come off," Gutierrez said, and Flores told the 
teen-ager that "it would not be permanent, it would wash off in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Bateman's family contacted police when the 2-inch-by-5-inch rose tattoo did 
not come off. 
</P>
<P>
 After the complaint was made, police went to Flores' apartment, where they 
recovered a small tattooing device. "The rig they confiscated operated on two 
D-cell (batteries)," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they were not aware of any prior cases involving the unlawful 
tattooing of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said her office mailed Flores notice of the charges. The letter 
orders him to appear in Van Nuys Municipal Court on March 1 for an arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of six months in County Jail 
and a possible $1,000 fine.

ARMS MAKER SENTENCED TO 30 MONTHS IN PRISON; CRIME: CHRISTOPHER BERWICK OF 
ACTON WAS AMONG NINE PEOPLE ARRESTED AFTER AN INVESTIGATION INTO A WHITE 
SUPREMACIST CONSPIRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A federal judge sentenced an Acton machinist to 30 months in prison Monday for 
conspiring with a North Hills couple to unlawfully manufacture and sell machine 
guns and silencers to a federal agent who posed as a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew imposed the sentence on Christopher 
Berwick, 46, who pleaded guilty in September to federal charges that from May, 
1992, to July, 1993, he made as many as 17 Sten machine-gun receiver tubes for 
machine-gun kits. 
</P>
<P>
 Berwick told prosecutors that he obtained the machine-gun kits from Christian 
Nadal. Nadal and his wife Doris are serving prison sentences for their roles in 
the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Berwick and the Nadals were among nine people arrested by the FBI in July and 
August after an 18-month undercover investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U. S. Atty. Gregory W. Jessner said he was disappointed by the 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had argued that the sentence should be higher," Jessner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessner said the judge apparently believed that Berwick played a minor role in 
the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We argued that the person who actually manufactured weapons played a vital 
role," Jessner said. "Lew disagreed and said he was going to give Christopher 
Berwick a break." 
</P>
<P>
 Berwick had faced a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier interview, Richard C. Callahan, an attorney representing 
Berwick, maintained that his client made only pieces of certain weapons. The 
attorney said Berwick became sick to his stomach when he read evidence about 
the white supremacy movement. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury convicted Christian Nadal, 35, in October of 15 counts of 
selling and transferring illegal weapons and Doris Nadal, 41, of a single 
conspiracy count. Throughout their trial, attorneys for the couple maintained 
that they were victims of government entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lew sentenced Christian Nadal in December to eight years in prison and Doris 
Nadal to three years and a month.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SEVERAL COUNCIL HOPEFULS FAIL TO QUALIFY FOR 
BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council hopeful Harold E. Smith failed to qualify to have his name appear 
on the April ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 59-year-old automotive machinist, failed to submit the required 
signatures of 20 registered voters within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lancaster, two of the 15 City Council hopefuls also failed to qualify. 
Neither Roger Price, 39, or Belinda Warren, 34, met the filing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Smith, Price and Warren did not submit enough valid signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The disqualification of Price and Warren leaves 13 candidates, including three 
incumbents, on the ballot in Lancaster. Three four-year term council seats are 
available in the April 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Smith on the ballot in Palmdale, there will be 13 council candidates, 
including two incumbents, vying for two four-year seats. Four residents, 
including the incumbent, are seeking the two-year term mayor's post. 
</P>
<P>

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TECHNOLOGY, MUSCLE HELP STRICKEN LIBRARY; 
RECOVERY: THOUSANDS OF WATER-DAMAGED BOOKS AT VALENCIA OUTLET WILL BE SALVAGED 
THROUGH VACUUM FREEZE DRYING. BRANCH WILL BE CLOSED 90 DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A mix of high-tech repairs and low-tech muscle is rescuing books and 
periodicals from the Valencia Library, which was hit harder by the Jan. 17 
earthquake than any of Los Angeles County's 87 library outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch will be closed 90 days. While there was no structural damage, 
one-fourth of the library's 155,000 books, periodicals and other publications 
sustained water damage after the 6.6-magnitude earthquake ruptured pipes on the 
building's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked when I got to Valencia," said Robert Seal, library area manager 
for the north county region. "Think of the worst earthquake movie you've ever 
seen -- it was that bad. Books were four feet deep off the shelves." 
</P>
<P>
 Initial estimates are that $500,000 in materials were lost. Reference books, 
government publications and magazines bore the brunt of the water damage 
because of their proximity to broken pipes. Virtually untouched were books in 
the children's section on the library's west side. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7,500 to 8,000 books will be salvaged through vacuum freeze drying, Seal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stronger the vacuum, the lower temperature it takes to boil water," Seal 
said. "They freeze-dry the books, put heat into the vacuum and the frozen water 
in the book is converted directly to steam." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeze-drying is expected to save the library thousands of dollars in 
replacement expenses -- it costs $1.25 to $1.50 to freeze-dry a book -- but it 
was the low-tech muscle power of volunteers that saved most of the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 volunteers and library staffers worked three 14-hour days to 
retrieve, catalogue and box materials. The long hours saved 80% of the books 
and periodicals from additional damage by removing them from the wet, 
quake-rattled structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Water had already flooded much of the library by the time Bobbie Norwood, 
circulation assistant for the library who lives in Saugus, entered the 
structure three hours after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was horrified," said Norwood, the first person to enter the building. "I 
couldn't believe it, because there hadn't been that much damage to my home." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a sheriff's deputy, Norwood turned off water to the building 
and prevented more flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24,000-square-foot library was built during 1971 and opened in May, 1972. 
This is the first time such a large-scale re-shelving of materials has been 
required. The entire library was re-shelved by sections in the late 1980s when 
the building was re-carpeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are unsure what long-term impact the earthquake will have upon 
library services. Hours of operation for the Newhall and Canyon Country 
branches, slashed to two days a week during county budget cutting, have been 
boosted to three days a week for as long as the Valencia branch remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Country Library will be open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays; 1 to 8 p.m. 
Wednesdays; and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays. Newhall Library is scheduled to 
reopen Wednesday, and will be open 1 to 8 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays and 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Fridays.

OJAI VALLEY TAKES ON THE 'BLACK ORB'; ACTIVISM: FIGHT AGAINST A NATIONAL 
WEATHER SERVICE TOWER IS THE RESIDENTS' LATEST CAUSE. LIKE IT OR NOT, THE 
ARDENT GROUP HAS BECOME A POTENT POLITICAL FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ojai is a well-read, well-educated hamlet that does not easily take no for an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Its residents are more likely to vote than those elsewhere in Ventura County, 
they mobilize quickly and they do not take to those they consider a threat to 
the quality of life in the verdant Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Ojai activists have derailed a would-be landfill, squelched a 
petroleum plant expansion, felled a university site, muscled into a private 
golf resort's development plans and filed numerous lawsuits to protect their 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not -- and many clearly do not -- citizen activists in the Ojai 
Valley have become a political force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very, very bright people," said attorney Mitchel B. Kahn, who 
represented the waste management firm that last year lost a bid to open a 
landfill in a nearby canyon. "Together, they make quite a formidable group." 
</P>
<P>
 A higher percentage of Ojai residents hold college degrees and library cards 
than in Ventura County as a whole. But some say that the location beneath the 
TopaTopa Mountains contributes to the town's individualism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's geographical," said Greg Helms of the Environmental Defense Center, a 
Santa Barbara legal advocacy firm that handles lawsuits for several groups in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you live in the Ojai Valley, you're together in a kind of village," he 
said. "It's a sort of an Old America feeling about the community that lends 
itself to public participation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at USA Petroleum do not like to talk about Ojai's activism. They are 
apparently still smarting from a citizens panel that 10 years ago thwarted a 
planned $100-million expansion at the firm's Petrochem refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 96 acres have been up for sale ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest political battle cry was sounded after the National Weather Service 
began erecting a 98-foot radar tower atop Sulphur Peak in the upper Ojai 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The tower will greatly enhance their ability to monitor thunderstorms, wind 
currents and other atmospheric conditions, weather service officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Information gleaned from the new system -- designed to replace an aging tower 
in Los Angeles -- will be shared with federal air traffic controllers and 
military brass to help track flight paths and plan strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is urgent that the Sulphur Mountain radar become operational as soon as 
possible," said Thomas Potter, regional director of the weather service. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one told those who live along the pricey ridge that the so-called 
"black orb" was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Upper Ojai residents awoke one crisp morning in early December in the shadow 
of what looked to them like a huge black ball nesting above a thick steel 
scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days they stood in front of a Ventura County Superior Court judge 
arguing for, and receiving, a temporary restraining order prohibiting 
completion of the weather-tracking project. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks since, the government has condemned a portion of a driveway that 
leads to the site, threatened to arrest protesters and unleashed federal 
lawyers to ensure that the project is not delayed further. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, a federal judge sided with the government and refused to issue a 
restraining order blocking construction of the project. Another hearing is set 
for Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the radar tower point to research that possibly links higher 
instances of cancer, birth defects, leukemia and other maladies to the kind of 
low-level radiation emitted from the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a highly educated community," said David Hedman, an upper Ojai 
resident who fought the Weldon Canyon dump and is one of the plaintiffs in the 
weather station lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear those fighting the radar and other ecological-legal battles tell it, 
the Ojai Valley is one of the last resting places of popular rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina V. Shelley, an Ojai councilwoman who served a stint in the Marine Corps, 
calls the activist sentiment a mix of Old West tenacity and sheer grit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I operate with when I'm speaking for the community," she said. 
"Don't let go. Don't even consider failing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranch owner Kim Bonsall knows that community doggedness from personal 
experience. She ran headlong into it last year when the Bonsall family was 
about to allow a landfill on part of its 6,500-acre spread in Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire how quickly they got organized," Bonsall said. "But I don't admire 
what they said once they got organized. For any project that goes on, 
(activists) are very quick to say something negative before having all the 
facts in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonsall is not alone. Many private attorneys and local officials have been 
forced to answer to Ojai-based environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do keep me on my toes, no doubt about that," said Richard H. Baldwin, 
director of the county Air Pollution Control District. "They confront us by 
meetings, letters, what have you. Elsewhere in the county, that's not 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 But confrontation can also be an asset, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the business view I hear constantly, but we don't hear the citizen's 
view very often," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, lawyers for the firm planning to build a private golf resort on a 
sprawling hillside above the nearby community of Meiners Oaks still hold a 
grudge against the citizen activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some genuinely concerned people up there, but some of the activists 
would have us all living in tepees again," said Lindsay F. Nielson, who 
represents Farmont Corp., which wants to build the golf course. "They simply 
believe that any form of development is evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielson, a board member of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., called many of 
the activist efforts misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai does have a large number of people who are very environmentally in 
tune," he said. "But they aren't interested in what impact (a project) has on 
the economy of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a proposed university campus did not escape the purview of the ecological 
watchdogs. As soon as officials targeted Taylor Ranch, near California 33 and 
U.S. 101, for a state university, opponents concerned about air quality in the 
Ojai Valley went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were planning for 20,000 students," said Pat Baggerly, a Meiners Oaks 
resident and member of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County that 
opposed the site. "And all that (smog) blows up this way." 
</P>
<P>
 The campus is now being planned for a lemon grove outside Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Another element at work in Ojai is that many artisans and performers seeking 
refuge from Los Angeles have made the enclave home, propagating its reputation 
for eco-activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrity residents "do help draw attention from the media, and that tells 
people what's going on," said actor Larry Hagman, who owns a 30-acre spread 
atop Sulphur Mountain. "But I don't know that I've had that much impact."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA MOVES CITY HALL OFFICES TO NEW 
SITE; GOVERNMENT: A BUILDING IN SAUGUS BECOMES THE TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE 
CENTER WHILE THE BADLY DAMAGED CIVIC STRUCTURE IS REPAIRED. 
</P>

<P>
 After operating out of tents and trailers in the parking lot of its 
quake-hammered headquarters for more than two weeks, the city of Santa Clarita 
on Monday began moving its offices to a temporary site in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, a building owned by Cytec Engineered Materials Inc., 21444 
Golden Triangle Road, will serve as the city's administrative center while 
repairs are made to City Hall, which suffered about $4 million in damages in 
the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs to the City Hall building at 23920 Valencia Blvd. are expected to take 
three months, and will include shoring up and seismically reinforcing the 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Lease terms are not yet complete for the city's temporary home, said Cytec 
plant manager Joe Sadera, but the city will pay only operational costs for the 
use of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a vacant building and the city needs a place to stay, so we're going 
to help them out," Sadera said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Finance Director Steve Stark said the new building was selected in part 
because it is large enough to house all city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way we can broadcast to the citizens, 'City Hall is now HERE,' instead 
of having things spread out all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stark said he will be relieved to move to more permanent quarters, he 
was surprised at how smoothly the city was able to operate under adverse 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's remarkable how well we've done outdoors," Stark said. "This tent has 
gone through an evolution from emergency response to disaster recovery." He 
said some recovery services -- such as building inspection requests -- would 
continue to be offered from the City Hall parking lot for at least the next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as there's a need, we'll be out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a second disaster assistance center opened Monday at the Saugus 
train station in Hart Park. Before then, residents of the Santa Clarita Valley 
in need of earthquake relief services had to go to Canyon Country Park in the 
city's northeastern corner.

NATIONWIDE COALITION TARGETING EIGHT SITES, INCLUDING A CEMENT PLANT NEAR 
GORMAN.

 An Antelope Valley group joined a nationwide coalition of activists Monday in 
urging federal officials to halt the burning of hazardous waste at eight sites, 
including a Southern California cement plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Citizens Against Pollution was among 12 public health, environmental 
and waste-treatment groups that filed the petition in Washington, D. C. The 
document warned U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol 
Browner that the groups will file a lawsuit within 60 days unless she moves to 
halt the waste burning. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the eight sites targeted by the activists is the National Cement Co. 
plant just northeast of Gorman, near the Los Angeles-Kern county line. Members 
of Desert Citizens Against Pollution have alleged that the plant is releasing 
toxic air emissions that may be causing health problems among nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Lowrance, associate deputy administrator with the EPA in Washington, 
said the activists' petition "is very consistent with the administration's 
position about what we should be doing regarding cement kilns. . . . We are 
absolutely committed to going after these facilities when they cause some 
environmental problems." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the EPA is preparing to take action before the 60-day deadline 
against some firms that burn hazardous waste, but she did not know if National 
Cement would be among these. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement Monday, National Cement said it is legally permitted 
to burn hazardous waste-derived fuel. The firm said an independent study filed 
with the state "showed the facility to be operating well within federal and 
state health risk guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the EPA said it planned to deny National Cement a permit to 
continue burning hazardous waste because its application lacked a signature 
from Tejon Ranchcorp, which leases its land to the plant. The company can 
continue to burn waste until a final decision is handed down, probably in the 
spring, said Virginia Donohue, a spokeswoman for the EPA's regional office in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Tejon Ranchcorp's parent company is 30% owned by Times Mirror Co., which 
publishes the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>

THE JOY OF CRYING; GO AHEAD, HAVE A BAWL. RESEARCHERS SAY TEARS ARE GOOD FOR 
YOU -- EVEN THOUGH CULTURAL MORES DISCOURAGE US FROM SHEDDING ANY.

 Yesterday, my 4-year-old stopped crying. 
</P>
<P>
 He fell off his bike, held his breath and gritted his teeth. "I'm not gonna 
cry, Mom," he said. "I'm really not." 
</P>
<P>
 Where did this pint-size stoicism come from? Batman videos? Preschool 
name-callers? Maybe the neighbors who tell their kid, "Crying will get you 
nowhere." You hear it everywhere: You'd better not pout, you'd better not cry. 
Big girls don't cry. Grin and bear it, hide it, stifle it, but whatever you do, 
don't cry, please , don't cry. I'll give you a cookie if you stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffle .  
</P>
<P>
 So why am I upset? Because on some level I know that it's healthful to cry. It 
is, in the words of biochemist William H. Frey II, "a natural mechanism for 
adapting to emotional stress" -- a way of equalizing sadness, anger, fear, 
surprise, frustration or joy. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey, who has studied crying for 20 years, directs the Ramsey Clinic's Dry Eye 
and Tear Research Center in St. Paul, Minn. If he has found anything, it's that 
the chemistry of crying sets us right. Not doing it can literally make us sick. 
And my kid has just joined the roughly 25% of America that's not doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel like running after bike and child, yelling: "Go ahead and cryyyyyy!" 
Years from now, will my son end up in therapy, 12-Step meetings, encounter 
weekends or spiritual journeys, trying to crack open the reservoir? 
</P>
<P>
 Says Frey: "I get hundreds of letters from people who say, 'I wish I could 
learn to cry again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a nation, we're all mixed up about crying. Our children come into the world 
and -- slap, WAAAaaaa ! -- it's the only thing they know how to do. It ensures 
survival. Cry and get fed. Cry and get held. Cry and get loved. But then, the 
most basic of human utterances gets roped in by rules and prohibitions: 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffle at weddings and funerals, but don't wail. Cry at movies, but only 
silently, in the dark, facing forward, and be sure to stop before you hit the 
popcorn counter. If you cry at work, make sure it isn't in front of the boss or 
a client. Don't cry in front of a man if you're a woman, or a woman if you're a 
man, or a man if you're a man. No matter who or where you are, keep the runny 
nose in check. If you really want to make a good impression, don't cry at all. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a classic case of nature versus culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, if we were all like Robinson Crusoe, beyond the reach of civilization, 
we could wail at will and be healthier for it. But we're not. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone's crying, what do you do? Comfort them? Pity them? Avoid them?" 
asks Sonoma State University psychologist Carolyn Saarni, an expert in 
socialization of emotions. "It's uncomfortable. The impact on other people is 
huge." So we devise all sorts of ways for damming the emotional Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept holding on and telling myself, telling myself, 'Don't cry, don't cry, 
don't cry,' " says a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney, recalling an 
episode at her workplace. "We were deposing this woman who was a witness for 
the other side. I was technically the enemy. She was talking about this 
wonderful family with the mother who died of cancer. Finally, I sort of 
squeaked, 'No further questions.' I stared straight ahead, got in the elevator, 
into my car and drove off. As soon as I got to a stoplight, I cried like a 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My 4-year-old is playing with a friend who wags his finger when my son sheds 
tears over a lost new toy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You shouldn't cry," the friend says. "There are germs in your tears and 
they'll get on your face. They'll make you sick." 
</P>
<P>
 "They will not!" my son says, standing up to his challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask the friend where he heard about the germs. "From my mom." 
</P>
<P>
 So it begins. My child's natural urge is bent by others, what families, 
institutions and playground survival tactics dictate. Which wins out? How can 
you teach your kid to do the natural thing if it goes against the currents of 
the culture? Germs in the tears, boys who cry are sissies, girls who cry are 
manipulative, parents can't cry unless they want everyone to lose confidence in 
them, our leaders shouldn't unless they want a close-up on the nightly news. 
</P>
<P>
 Says behaviorist Saarni: "In our society, a person's identity is often defined 
by his or her dominant emotional state -- you are what you feel. We say, 'Oh, 
he's a very happy person' or 'She's cheerful. Or stoic.' Your emotional state 
gets turned into a personality trait." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone who cries, then, is weak. Not a trooper. Not the kind of Puritan who 
made it over on the Mayflower, colonized the wilderness and tamed the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We idealize the stoic," says Peg Crepeau, a Milwaukee psychotherapist who has 
revealed a connection between not crying and such stress diseases as ulcers and 
colitis. "We made a goddess out of Jackie Kennedy, this immovable object who 
never showed any emotion, who never once cried. We thought it was elegant and 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman in Crepeau's crying study, a psychiatrist in her 50s, kept a box of 
Kleenex in her office so her own patients could wipe their tears, but she 
hadn't cried herself since she was 13. The first time she remembers really 
crying, she was at the dentist. Her father told her that if she didn't stop, 
he'd yank every tooth out of her head. The next time, she was at the funeral of 
a grandfather she adored. Her father told her that if she didn't stop 
embarrassing the family like that, she'd have to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never cried again," Crepeau says. By the time she was 50, she had 
ulcerative colitis. And maybe more. 
</P>
<P>
 People who can't cry "lose their connections to what they feel -- to intimate 
relationships, to nature and the environment, the healthy part of the self and 
the world," says Don Elium, a Contra Costa County family counselor who has 
developed a way to help people with post-traumatic stress learn to cry. Holding 
back becomes a force unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Says biochemist Frey: "The James Bond image of having to be in control all the 
time has serious consequences for the individual and the society." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet crying has always kept people healthy, behaviorists say. The original 
ability to vocalize distress helped early mammals protect their young and to 
communicate danger, fear and helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were social signals . . . with tremendous survival value," says Columbia 
University psychiatrist Myron Hofer, who has studied vocalizations in rats. 
Survival favored the fittest: the criers. Evolution gave people tears to help 
cleanse the distress, a function Frey believes separates humans from other 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time American culture came along, social evolution brought a new 
recipe for survival. If you want to do the dinner party, learn to use the crab 
fork. If you want to be a trooper, get back in the saddle with a wound to the 
chest, hurting, but heroic. Like my kid on his bike. So should he cry or not 
cry? The question evokes two warring veins of thought predating the time the 
New Testament told us that Jesus wept: the ethic of self-expressiveness and the 
ethic of self-control. 
</P>
<P>
 The first gave us Athens. Aristotle. Thomas Jefferson. Compassion. The flow. 
Keening at the wake. Wringing out the highs and lows through the tears -- like 
my son's Irish grandfather, who weeps over a dead beetle in the weed patch. The 
second brought us Sparta. Plato. Alexander Hamilton. Order. The emotional dam. 
Stiffening the upper lip. Holding it in for social tidiness -- like the mother 
of the kid with the germs in the tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's evidence that crying isn't voluntary," Frey says. "A few people can 
turn it on and off at will. But for most people, it's, 'Uh-oh, I'm crying.' " 
Which is just fine if you live in a culture where crying is not only OK, but 
encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many cultures, crying is a way of showing cohesion," psychologist Saarni 
says. "With Mediterranean peoples, for example, it isn't a sign of weakness or 
dependency. It is met with admiration. If there's some big disaster in a Greek 
village, everyone, the men included, is out there crying and carrying on. It's 
a collective catharsis." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychotherapist Crepeau points out that Irish, Jewish and African American 
cultures -- "peoples who historically have suffered grievously" -- tend to 
embrace crying and, at the same time, are celebrated for their humor. 
</P>
<P>
 But in mainstream America, the "Uh-oh, I'm crying" sets off the alarm. Here we 
go. If the floodgates open, the unsightly gulping and sobbing can't be far 
behind, and then, sin of cultural sins, you're out of control.  
</P>
<P>
 "I spend a lot of energy trying not to cry," says one woman who several years 
ago wept for weeks when her mother was dying. "It's like a Pandora's box. Once 
you open it up, you can never close it. Once it happens, you're no longer 
crying tears -- they're crying you." 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to the tears when they don't get cried? 
</P>
<P>
 "An important part of us literally goes underground," says Bruce Silverman, a 
Berkeley men's group counselor. "You can't believe what's it like to see a very 
successful middle-aged man who doesn't know how to cry, sitting there, 
struggling to be human." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's evidence that our 400-year Puritan dry spell may be coming to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our attitude is improving, but only slowly," Frey says. Small signs: the 
current wave of tear-jerker movies. The maturing thirtysomething generation, 
raised on therapy and human potential. The President of the United States, who 
cried and didn't try to hide it. Norman Schwarzkopf, who said he wouldn't trust 
a man who couldn't cry at the battlefront. Even Clint Eastwood, who won an 
Academy Award for showing that gunslingers had emotions. The shift is subtle, 
but inexorable. 
</P>
<P>
 And the kid with the germs in the tears? This morning his bike went off the 
sidewalk and spilled him onto the road. He wailed. My son ran to his friend's 
rescue, held his breath and gritted his teeth. His lip quivered. His eyes 
brimmed. The dam burst.

THE JOY OF CRYING

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Ramsey Clinic's Dry Eye and Tear Research Center in St. Paul, Minn., 
William H. Frey II studies the biochemistry of emotional tears, hoping to 
quantify the human mystery of crying. His findings: There's a huge gender gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys and girls up to age 12 cry with the same frequency, but afterward, girls 
cry more. After age 18, women cry almost four times as frequently as men. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a certain age, boys learn to disengage," Frey says. But he believes that 
there's a biological basis as well. Emotional tears contain the hormone 
prolactin, which aids milk production and is released in response to stress in 
both men and women. By age 18, women have 60% more prolactin in their blood 
than men.  
</P>
<P>
 In his studies, Frey found: 
</P>
<P>
 * Women cried an average 5.3 times a month; men, 1.4 times a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women (85%) and men (73%) said they felt better after crying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Men (71%) reported "watery eyes only" and women (47%) reported "flowing 
tears." 
</P>
<P>
 * Women (6%) and men (45%) said they didn't cry at all. MARY ANN HOGAN

FOR NOW, AT LEAST, L.A. IS THE EPICENTER OF GOOD DEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We were begged to make love, not war. That made a lot of babies but didn't do 
much to keep us out of Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we were offered a kinder, gentler nation, brightened by a thousand points 
of light. It went dark after one term. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we're into random acts of senseless kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the blissful, altruistic, current message of four books, several 
thousand T-shirts, bumper stickers on Kern County sheriff's vehicles and a 
rediscovered Gospel according to neighborhood pulpits. 
</P>
<P>
 What stirred a year ago as an essay assignment at a community college is 
bringing a mountain of mail from Europe and Asia, adoption by "The Crusaders" 
television news magazine and a rising domestic challenge: If disease can be 
eased by a Great American Smokeout, why not try dimming violence with a World 
Kindness Day? 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the violence was Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 And the goodness and benefaction that broke out certainly has tempered the 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons and Hughes markets gave away food and an elderly woman continues to hunt 
the west Valley's runaway dogs with cans of Alpo. An attorney carried 200 Big 
Macs to Balboa Park and a convoy came to our tent cities from St. Mary's Food 
Bank in Phoenix. A California National Guardsman played his harmonica for a 
cluster of cold children, and a woman from El Salvador cried in the night. In 
her country, she says, soldiers aren't friends of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 For a glowing moment, Los Angeles was the epicenter of Good Samaritanism. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chuck Wall is delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a Bakersfield College human relations instructor and the accidental guru 
of it all. Last year, Wall, 53, was thoroughly dismayed by a persistent, banal 
cliche of radio news: "We have another random act of senseless violence to 
report." 
</P>
<P>
 He mentally edited the phrase, substituting kindness for violence . 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Wall says, he had "a great phrase that turned a negative into a 
positive." Which he turned into an assignment, challenging his class to 
perform, then write about, their own acts of senseless kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 In almost immediate concert, a world of nervous youngsters, angry parents, 
jaded cops, worried clergy and frustrated politicians began clutching at Wall's 
alternative to human disregard and rudeness -- this tiny opportunity to tug 
America from its bad mood. 
</P>
<P>
 It is fitting that Wall was contacted last week by four San Fernando Valley 
schools wanting to start their own kindness crusades. They know it will aid 
communities and help heal students. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more appropriate was that volunteers moving among earthquake victims 
included a team from the Bakersfield Family Medical Center. Wall disciples all, 
their T-shirts asked: "Today, I Will Commit One Random Act of Senseless 
Kindness . . . Will You?" 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred thousand Los Angeles residents have no need to respond. They 
are two weeks into doing whatever they can, whenever asked and mostly without 
being asked. And their acts are far from random. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Carlisle, 66, a Korean War veteran and West Pointer, is a sick man. He 
has suspended renal failure and his life sentence is three home dialysis 
treatments each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlisle knew exactly what he needed to do between sessions of cleansing his 
own blood. While the earthquake still grumbled, he drove to the Wilshire 
Dialysis Center and answered the phone, got the door and eased the discomfort 
of other kidney patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would he do that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why wouldn't I?" he responds. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Molina, a Woodland Hills publicist, felt obligated to kindness by a gift. 
When he bought ice and emergency supplies at a Ventura Boulevard liquor store, 
a clerk wouldn't charge him for candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina duplicated the kindness. He drove to Chatsworth to check on friends and 
employees, ran their errands and invited a dozen to a party at his own cracked 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my Quake Wake, a barbecue with champagne and caviar because being 
extravagant amagnified the pick-me-up," he says. "I saw acts of kindness 
everywhere. . . . Unlike other times in my city, this time the only thing that 
was bad news was the quake, not the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Times reporter Rich Connell could have declined involvement by pleading 
professional objectivity. But he spent a night in a shelter at Van Nuys High 
School for one story and was moved by the dedication of volunteer nurses trying 
to calm crying babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a point where you say: 'All these people want is a couple of rocking 
chairs,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell posted an appeal on a city room notice board. He has been given two 
rockers with promises of more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake reduced Beaver's Den -- Sandra Beaver's antique store in 
Tarzana -- to three trash containers of broken glass and china. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rang at the height of her misery. It was a wrong number, a woman 
calling from New Jersey and failing in a frantic search for word of an elderly 
relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaver calmed her, took the Valley number and was able to contact the unharmed 
relative. Then she called New Jersey with the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would I have done that before the earthquake, before my customers called to 
see if we were OK and could they come down and help?" she says. "Probably not." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, maybe, kindness has a shelf life and random acts will diminish with the 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 When walls are no longer tumbling down, when damage is repaired and no longer 
a reminder, will we revert to cutting in and flipping off and barging through 
our daily encounters? 
</P>
<P>
 Wall thinks not. 
</P>
<P>
 He says there's just too much attention being paid to the idea for it to be a 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere you look, everything you read, everyone you talk to is saying 
they've had it with violence and that there must be a better way to live," Wall 
says. "And kindness is a better way." 
</P>
<P>
 But how can this ideal succeed when most other dreams have sputtered? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there are no special-interest groups involved and kindness is not a 
political statement," he says. "No famous people are involved, you don't have 
to spend money on it, it requires no physical effort and political correctness 
certainly isn't part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Random acts of senseless kindness is just Heartland America."

HEALTH WATCH; ADVANCES OFFER HOPE FOR ELIMINATING ARTHRITIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthritis, which has afflicted humankind since antiquity, may be eliminated in 
the next few decades, according to a researcher for the Arthritis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this decade, we will see a whole range of new arthritis treatments being 
developed," says Dr. Brian Butcher, group vice president of research for the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "And each day, researchers are one small step closer to finding cures and 
preventions for arthritis diseases." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past few months, there have been several important research 
advances, including the discovery of an antibody treatment that blocks the 
effects of inflammatory arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk, Don't Run: Not sure how to walk? Here, the three stages of "Bodywalk," a 
method devised by Reebok, a fitness walker and researchers at San Diego State 
University: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technique 1: Easy walking (16-minute mile or slower) with focus on posture. 
The head should be up, the shoulders back and down, the chest up to avoid 
hunched posture that is less mechanically efficient. Abdominal muscles should 
be tucked in to support the lower back. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technique 2: Faster (13- to 15-minute mile), with arms at 90-degree angles 
and pumping forward and back (not side to side); according to the Reebok 
program, this helps the walker proceed at a faster pace. Forearms should be 
kept toward the front of the body and palms should not swing past the hips or 
above the sternum. Walker should roll all the way through the foot, from the 
heel that is planted to the ball of the foot and toes that launch the walker 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technique 3: Fastest (12-minute mile and faster), with hips moving back and 
forth to accommodate quicker, shorter steps, placing one foot in front of the 
other.

CRYING TYPES

 Experts say the type of crier you are depends on who you are, from personality 
type to family and cultural beliefs. The people who tend to feel best are those 
who cry easily and don't worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tear up for sentiment and sob over anger and unhappiness," says Adele 
Stern, a San Luis Obispo grandmother of four. "I can tear up under the dryer at 
the hairdresser when I'm reading a romance. I still tear up over 'Heidi' and 
'Bambi' when the mother dies. It's a relaxing release. I cried for my 65th 
birthday when my family gave me a birthday cake with all 66 candles burning at 
the same time -- one for good luck. I think it's great. I'm glad we're allowed 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of us are made to feel like oddities. "When I was growing up, I'd cry 
at anything -- at home during an argument, at school if I didn't get an 
assignment in on time," says Don Elium, a Contra Costa County family counselor. 
"In North Carolina where I grew up, a boy who cried like that was said to have 
a bad case of the nerves. But it's just an emotional sensibility that runs 
through me, something I was able to channel through the work I do." 
</P>
<P>
 If you cry and worry about it, you feel worse. "I cry at anything, and it's 
something I can't stand about myself," says a Bay Area video producer and 
mother of a 5-year-old daughter. "I'm trying to teach my daughter not to cry 
like that. . . . I want her to know we live in a society where people who let 
their feelings out . . . get stomped." Then there are people who can't, don't 
or won't cry. Just why that is, says tear expert William H. Frey, is not clear. 
"It's probably a combination of forces -- either it's too socially unacceptable 
or too painful." MARY ANN HOGAN

MARKETING: TRAVEL ADS TRY THE HEART SELL; MADISON AVE. USES ROMANCE TO 
REVITALIZE THE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not just the "Love Boat" anymore. Here comes the Love Train -- and other 
more sensual lures for travelers -- courtesy of Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The usually conservative Amtrak has just unwrapped an unexpectedly flashy 
print ad campaign that poses the rather racy question "Can a Train Holiday 
Improve Your Love Life?" A train trip, the ad vows, "will send your love life 
into orbit." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a new TV spot for Norwegian Cruise Line takes cruise 
advertising to unprecedented levels of sexual explicitness. One Norwegian ad 
was so sexual in nature that censors at NBC ordered the ad modified before 
airing it during Sunday's Super Bowl game. "There is no law that says you can't 
make love at four in the afternoon on a Tuesday," the ad says. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel marketers are taking sensuality to sea -- and even chugging it along 
train tracks. As the nation's travel industry tries to recover from several 
consecutive years of disappointing growth, some of the country's biggest travel 
companies are hopeful that ads promising a tryst or two will send consumers 
scurrying to their travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their blatant sensuality, the new ads generally are not seen as 
sexist, because they tend to treat men and women on equal terms and as equally 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody dreams about making it in one of those sleeper berths," said 
Allison Cohen, president of the New York-based ad consulting firm PeopleTalk. 
"We're talking about the kind of old-fashioned romance that used to be 
associated with travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Travel marketers are getting wise to the secret desires of travelers -- 
including those of many middle-aged couples. "There is a big market out there 
saying, 'We need to get away and refresh our marriage,"' said JeraldJellisona 
Los Angeles psychiatrist and consultant. "Most people hope their love lives 
will improve when they step away from everything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Romance is an excellent marketing hook," added Roberta Clarke, professor of 
marketing at Boston University. In a tough economy, travel companies that can't 
claim to be the lowest-priced need some other very attractive promise, she 
said. "So why not romance?" 
</P>
<P>
 The number of trips taken by Americans was up less than 3% in 1993 compared to 
1992, reports the Washington-based Travel Industry Assn. of America. That's 
less than half the annual growth the industry was enjoying just a handful of 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one reason why travel ads with sensual themes are likely to continue 
for some time, said Edward Book, president of the travel association. "They are 
trying to appeal to baby boomers who are moving into their late 40s and 50s," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That accurately describes the middle-aged couple in the Amtrak ad, seen 
hugging in the aisle of the train. Says the ad: "A train trip is like one long, 
fascinating date." 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak officials want to see ridership -- especially among the middle-aged -- 
pick up from its current slow pace. Ridership was up only slightly in 1993 
compared to 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 "Train travel is a way to get away from it all," said Joan Wheatley, director 
of advertising for Amtrak. "If people care for each other, a train trip can 
become a very romantic experience." 
</P>
<P>
 How romantic? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the New York ad agency that created the print ad first talked to a 
number of train passengers. "People tell us there's something very sexy about 
trains," said Damion O'Malley, executive vice president of DDB Needham. "It 
throws you together for hours on end. There's an air of, well, anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But romantic travel may be most commonly associated with cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
 That theme was picked up eight years ago by Princess Cruise Line, whose ship 
was used as a backdrop on the popular "Love Boat" TV series. Each weekly show 
usually featured a heated romance. Now the cruise line calls all of its ships 
"Love Boats." Its TV spots star Gavin MacLeod, who played the ship's captain on 
the show. The ads also use the show's theme song. 
</P>
<P>
 "We research this every year," said Julie Benson, director of public relations 
for Princess. "Consumers keep telling us that the 'Love Boat' has a lot of 
positive associations. So we stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The current TV and print ads for Norwegian Cruises make the "Love Boat" look 
tame. One print ad features a photo of a woman's bare back in a waterfall. "I 
will be naked more," she says in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that people go on vacations to renew relationships," said Jeff 
Stutin, marketing director for Norwegian. "We're just bringing that to the 
forefront." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a bit too much so -- at least in the eyes of NBC censors. Prior to 
airing a Norwegian TV spot during Sunday's Super Bowl, NBC told Norwegian's ad 
agency to modify one part of the ad that shows a woman caressing a man's chest. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "The ad is tame compared to some of the shots the network aired of the Dallas 
Cowgirls cheerleaders," said Jeffrey Goodby, co-chairman of the San Francisco 
ad agency Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most airlines have been careful to stay away from sensuality in advertising. 
The one exception is Singapore Airlines, which 22 years ago introduced the 
notion of air travel as a service in which its attendants are at the customer's 
beck and call. About 70% of the airline's passengers are males. 
</P>
<P>
 Its ads feature real flight attendants who are referred to as "Singapore 
Girls." And while Singapore Airlines also has several thousand male flight 
attendants, it has never so much as mentioned them in its ads. "We've spent 
millions on this successful campaign," said Teng Aun Hwang, senior vice 
president at Singapore. "Why change it if we don't need to?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ads have been criticized as sexist and exploitative, the 
Singapore Airlines executive insists there is no subliminal message of 
sexuality in the "Singapore Girl" ads. "These are our own employees," he said. 
"We would never treat them in any way other than a wholesome and respectful 
manner." Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Lord, Dentsu & Partners has picked up the $15-million AST 
Research account formerly handled by Team One Advertising of El Segundo. . . . 
Torrance-based Saatchi & Saatchi/Pacific has picked up the $10-million 
corporate account for Cypress-based Secure Horizons. . . . Anaheim-based Hansen 
Beverage Co. has narrowed its $2-million account review to five area ad shops. 
. . . Los Angeles-based Dailey & Associates has resigned the estimated 
$1-million Asiana Airlines account. . . . Los Angeles-based First Interstate 
Bank has handed its $25-million ad business to San Francisco-based Hal Riney & 
Partners. It was formerly handled by Los Angeles-based Campbell & Wagman. . . .

account.

ROVER, BRITAIN'S LAST AUTO GIANT, GOING TO BMW; MERGERS: THE $1.2-BILLION DEAL 
IS CRITICIZED BY 20% SHAREHOLDER HONDA AS A THREAT TO THE FIRM'S 'BRITISHNESS 
AND ROVERNESS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rover car company, Britain's last major auto maker, announced Monday that 
it is being sold to Germany's BMW for $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale by British Aerospace, which owns 80% of Rover's stock, is expected to 
allow Rover to expand its markets, selling its cars through BMW outlets in the 
United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the deal was criticized by Japanese auto maker Honda, which has a 20% 
stake in Rover and helped transform the company by revamping its product range 
and introducing modern cost-cutting practices on the assembly line. While Honda 
will keep its stake, the long-term future of its collaboration with Rover is in 
doubt, industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been cooperating with Rover for 15 years with the aim of maintaining 
the Britishness and Roverness of the indigenous British company," a Honda 
spokesman in Tokyo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise sale "negates Honda's and Rover's long-term efforts to establish 
a firm future for Rover as a British company with its own brand identity," 
Honda President Nobuhiko Kawamoto said. "Honda has always felt that a key to 
the success of this partnership was Rover's independence." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which must be approved by British Aerospace stockholders and 
government regulators, is also expected to draw criticism from British 
government opponents. They claimed that the sale of Rover to British Aerospace 
in 1988, when Rover was a nationalized company, was at a much undervalued 
price, costing taxpayers millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares in British Aerospace soared Monday as financial experts said the sale 
price was much higher than had been expected and partly explained why British 
Aerospace decided to unload. 
</P>
<P>
 Rover ran up losses of $13.5 million last year but was expected to rebound 
sharply this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale in effect means the end of a British-owned volume car industry. With 
Jaguar sold to Ford Motor Co. nearly five years ago, Rolls-Royce is the only of 
the great names of British motoring history that still remains in British 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 BMW will acquire Rover with its debts and pay in two installments: $840 
million on the sale completion and $360 million on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 In Munich, BMW Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder said: "The Rover and BMW model 
ranges complement each other. In addition, our differing regional strengths 
provide a powerful synergy." 
</P>
<P>
 In the sale, British Aerospace agreed to deliver all the trademark names of 
the line: Rover, Land Rover, MG, Triumph and Austin. Rover was the latest name 
for the company that during this century has produced such British classics as 
Wolesley, Riley, Austin Seven, Morris Oxford and Morris Minor. Later came the 
famed Mini, the Rover 2000, the Metro and the latest flag-carrier, the Rover 
800.

CHARGES FILED AGAINST BLOCKBUSTER OVER VIDEOTAPE REBATE OFFER; CONSUMERS: 
COMPANY ALLEGEDLY FAILED TO MENTION CONTINGENCY IN PROMOTION INVOLVING 'BEAUTY 
AND THE BEAST' AND OTHER FILMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Blockbuster Video on Monday was charged with false and misleading advertising 
in connection with a popular rebate offer for "Beauty and the Beast" and 24 
other video titles during December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed by the state attorney general's office and the Monterey County 
district attorney's office, alleges that the nation's largest video retailer 
violated California law when it failed to state in its advertising that a $5 
rebate on the video titles was contingent on buying other products, ranging 
from crackers and cookies to detergent and cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers discovered they had to buy additional merchandise to get the rebate 
only after they had purchased a video and read the rebate instructions that 
came with it, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace W. Knief, a spokesman for Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based Blockbuster 
Entertainment Corp., which operates the stores, said the company hadn't 
received a copy of the suit and doesn't comment on litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office said at least 33,000 Californians who purchased 
the video titles may have been misled. The state is seeking monetary penalties 
against Blockbuster and restitution to consumers allegedly duped by the rebate 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have argued that it is not a violation," said Herschel Elkins, senior 
assistant attorney general. "To us, it appears a clear violation." 
</P>
<P>
 Elkins said Blockbuster advertised the rebate offer in newspaper inserts and 
on posters in its video stores. The promotions said a $5 rebate was available, 
but did not tell consumers how to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertised price of "Beauty and the Beast," among the best-selling video 
titles ever, was $8.95 -- after the $5 rebate and a $3 rental coupon. Consumers 
who purchased "Beauty and the Beast" found out after opening it that in order 
to get the rebate they had to purchase four boxes of Nabisco crackers and mail 
in the receipt for the crackers and the videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers who purchased "Batman Returns" had to purchase All detergent to get 
a $5 rebate. Other titles in the promotion included "Hook," "101 Dalmations" 
and a Cindy Crawford workout tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies that make the crackers, detergent and other products were not 
named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Monterey County Superior Court, said the advertised 
"after-rebate" price for the videos was misleading because consumers were 
required to spend more money to get the rebate. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit said that consumers were required to make the additional purchases in 
a very short time. The promotion started on Nov. 26, 1992, and receipts for the 
video and the additional merchandise had to be dated no later than Dec. 31, 
1992, a condition stated only on the rebate instructions that came with the 
video. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who bought the video at the end of the sale would have to run out that 
day and buy crackers to get the rebate," said Lydia Villarreal, deputy district 
attorney in Monterey County. "A lot of people probably just crumpled up the 
paper and threw it away."

DOW INDEX POISED TO TOP 4,000 AS OPTIMISM SPURS 33-POINT GAIN; MARKETS: 
ANALYSTS ALSO CREDIT SURGE IN JAPAN'S NIKKEI AVERAGE WITH DRIVING U.S. STOCKS 
TO A THIRD STRAIGHT RECORD HIGH.

<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average and other major market indexes surged to 
record highs Monday on strength in foreign markets and general optimism about 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's sharp advance, which put it within striking distance of the 
benchmark 4,000 level, was led by stocks of cyclical companies that benefit 
most from an expanding economy such as autos, heavy machinery and mining. On 
Friday, a government reading on the economy showed strong growth and low 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow set its third consecutive record, rising 32.93 points to 3,978.36, 
eclipsing its previous high of 3,945.43 set Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, long-term interest rates rose despite initially holding 
steady on suggestions from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that 
inflation remains under control for now. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume rose to 322.87 million shares, up from 313.14 million in the 
previous session. January was the busiest month on record for the exchange, 
with total share volume of about 6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The market started the day strong, following stock prices overseas, and never 
looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese stocks surged 7.8%, while rallies took key indexes in Mexico City, 
London and Paris to record high closes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei stock average soared 1,471.24 to 20,229.12, a 
three-month high, after the weekend approval of political reform plans by 
Japan's Parliament.  
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index ended 38.17 points higher at 2,781.37. In Frankfurt, 
the DAX 30-share average closed at 2,177.45 up 43.98 points, while London's 
Financial Times 100-share average closed at 3,491.8, up 44.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story of the day is Japan, and that's what's moving our market," said 
James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said Greenspan's comments to Congress that inflation may be lower than 
actually reported gave further confidence that the low-interest-rate 
environment is likely to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 The market paid little attention to Greenspan's main message that short-term 
interest rates are "abnormally low" and are likely to be moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
 While some interpreted Greenspan's testimony to mean a rise in short-term 
interest rates could come in six months, others said they thought the remarks 
meant that long-term rates could be moving lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, analysts said Monday's reading on the economy had little impact on 
stocks. The Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal income rose 
0.6% in December. Private economists had expected a 0.5% rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's 500, New York Stock Exchange Composite and Nasdaq 
Composite indexes also wound up in record territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq index rose 3.94 to a record 800.47, eclipsing the record high of 
796.53 reached Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 So-called cyclical stocks rose sharply. General Motors climbed 2 to 61 1/4, 
Ford gained 1 3/4 to 67, Chrysler added 1 5/8 to 61 1/2, Deere jumped 2 5/8 to 
80 1/2 and Scott Paper rose 1 5/8 to 46 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aluminum stocks were strong, with Aluminum Co. of America up 2 7/8 to 79 
1/8, after aluminum-producing nations agreed to slash global production, 
putting the beleaguered industry on track for recovery. Alcoa was up 2 7/8 to 
79 1/8, Reynolds Metals rose 2 1/4 to 53 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Xerox rose 5 1/2 to 98 1/8. The company reported a fourth-quarter loss of 
$577 million largely because of special charges to cover the cost of a 
previously announced plan to eliminate 10,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tellabs lost 3 to 46 after the company said fourth-quarter earnings were 67 
cents a share, compared to 46 cents in the same period last year. Other Markets 
 
</P>
<P>
 Bond market analysts traced part of the rise in government bond yields to a 
wave of corporate borrowing, including a $1-billion deal from the Canadian 
province of Quebec. As part of corporate bond transactions, underwriters 
typically sell Treasury securities as a way to hedge against potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's sales were the first in a flood of expected corporate borrowing by 
foreign countries in the U.S. market this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield rose 6.23% from Friday's 6.21%. Its 
price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 5/16 point, or $3.13 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, comments by Greenspan would drive bond prices lower. Higher rates 
on new securities devalue already-sold bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists expect the Fed at some point to nudge up rates to curb the 
threat of rising prices as the economy continues to grow. But bond prices edged 
higher as investors apparently focused on Greenspan's failure to offer a 
specific timetable for taking action. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar fell against most key currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the New York Comex, gold closed at $381.60 an ounce, up $4.70 from 
Friday. Silver ended at $5.124 an ounce, up 11.6 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Light, sweet crude oil for March delivery fell 15 cents to $15.19 a barrel 
on the New York Merc.

SPOTLIGHT ON QVC'S DILLER AT DEADLINE TIME ON PARAMOUNT; MEDIA: SHOPPING 
NETWORK AND RIVAL SUITOR VIACOM ARE EXPECTED TO AGAIN RAISE THE ANTE FOR THE 
STUDIO AT THE 11TH HOUR.

<P>
 With final bids for Paramount Communications Inc. due today, QVC Network Inc. 
Chairman Barry Diller practiced brinkmanship Monday by leaving his 5-week-old 
bid unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 By holding off, Diller ran the risk of losing Paramount had a majority of 
shareholders tendered their stock to archrival Viacom Inc. by 9 p.m. PST, when 
that company's cash-rich offer was set to expire. In effect, Diller called the 
bluff of Wall Street speculators who had threatened to tender their stock to 
Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street sources said he made a fairly safe bet, since most 
stockholders are likely to sit tight until after 2 p.m. PST today, the final 
deadline for both sides to submit revised bids. QVC and Viacom are expected to 
raise the ante, although neither side knows what the other will do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has got to bid blind," according to one investment banker involved. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50% of Paramount's stock is now believed to be in the hands of 
arbitragers, while more cautious institutional investors have reduced their 
Paramount holdings. In an informal survey, arbitragers said Monday that they 
had no intention of tendering their shares as long as there was a chance of 
improved offers from both QVC and Viacom. "If I were an arbitrager, I'd do the 
same damn thing," acknowledged one investment banker involved in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Under rules adopted by the Paramount board, the five-month contest should be 
drawing to a close with final bids due today. If changes are made in the 
existing tender offers, the expiration date will be extended 10 business days. 
Under the auction rules, the outcome will be determined when 50.1% of 
Paramount's shares are tendered to one of the two suitors. 
</P>
<P>
 During the battle, both QVC and Viacom have altered the mix of cash and 
securities they have offered to Paramount shareholders in their two-tier tender 
offers. Depending on the daily fluctuation of their stocks, the so-called 
blended value of the bids has varied accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of trading Monday, Viacom valued its bid at about $81 per share, 
while QVC's was worth about $85.50 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 But Viacom won the endorsement of the Paramount board 10 days ago because it 
boosted the cash component of its bid to $107 per share and promised Paramount 
shareholders some restitution if Viacom shares plummeted in value. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, QVC has been expected to offer some similar guarantee for the 
value of its own securities -- and possibly more cash. QVC is currently 
offering $92 per share for 50.1% of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion varied Monday on just how much Viacom or QVC would be willing to raise 
its bid. One investment banker said he expects the blended value of the offers 
to rise to a range of $85 to $88 for each share of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 One source in the Viacom camp scoffed at such predictions. "I don't think 
either side is going to do much, if anything," the executive said. "It's all 
about shoring up value, as opposed to giving more." 
</P>
<P>
 But another executive close to Viacom said, "I've got a feeling (Viacom 
Chairman Sumner Redstone) is going to go in again" with an improved bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Intending to make the deadline stick, Paramount issued a warning last week 
that it "fully intends" to hold to the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In trading Monday, Paramount closed at $79.625, down 25 cents, while QVC added 
25 cents to close at $44. Viacom A shares were unchanged at $39.50, while 
Viacom B shares fell 75 cents to close at $35.25.

 Xerox Reports Loss of $577 Million: The company said the fourth-quarter loss 
was due chiefly to costs associated with its previously announced plan to 
eliminate 10,000 jobs.It set aside $813 million after taxes to cover severance 
and other costs in its document-processing business. The restructuring should 
yield pretax savings of $350 million in 1994, Chief Executive Paul A. Allaire 
said. The company's stock jumped $5.50 to $98.125 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. The loss amounted to $5.63 a share and compares to a loss of $736 
million, or $7.80 per share, during the fourth quarter of 1992. Revenue was 
$4.18 billion, down 1% from $4.23 billion a year earlier.

 Rates Rise on T-Bills: The Treasury Department sold $12.6 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 2.99%, up from 2.96% last 
week. Another $12.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 3.16%, up from 3.14% last week.The three-month bill rate was 
the highest since they sold for 3.02% on Jan. 10. The six-month bill rate was 
the highest since they averaged 3.18%, also on Jan. 10. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors -- 3.06% for three-month bills with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,924.40 and 3.26% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,840.20. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill Auction:

 Key Mortgage Rate's 3-Year Slide Ends: The Federal Home Loan Bank of San 
Francisco said the 11th District cost of funds, the rate to which many 
adjustable-rate mortgages are tied, edged up to 3.879% in December from 3.822% 
in November. It was the rate's first monthly increase since September, 1990, 
when the rate rose to 8.091% from 8.075% the prior month, the bank said. The 
rate measures the average cost of funds to the thrifts and other financial 
institutions in the district, which covers California, Arizona and Nevada.

 Treasury Expected to Borrow $45 Billion: The Treasury will announce Wednesday 
how it will sell the debt for the January-March quarter, including the makeup 
of refinancing auctions to sell three- and 10-year notes and 30-year 
bonds.Borrowing projection for the current quarter, which assumed a $20-billion 
cash balance on March 31, is $15 billion to $20 billion less than the 
Treasury's Nov. 1 estimate. The earlier figure assumed a $35-billion cash 
balance on March 31. The Treasury estimated that for the April-June quarter it 
will borrow $15 billion to $20 billion.

TEMPORARY HALT IS CALLED ON THE MERGERS OF MUTUAL S&LS; THRIFTS: THE MORATORIUM 
IS CALLED A GOOD FIRST STEP TO PROTECT DEPOSITORS WHEN THE INSTITUTIONS ARE 
ACQUIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a crackdown on windfall profits for some insiders, federal regulators 
imposed a moratorium Monday on mergers in which the stock of a depositor-owned 
savings and loan institutions is sold to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by the Office of Thrift Supervision was welcomed by Rep. Henry B. 
Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee. The Texas Democrat said it 
is a good first step to protect depositors when so-called mutual S&Ls are 
acquired by other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In calling a temporary halt to the merger activity, the OTS said it also 
intends to review standard conversions in which mutual S&Ls decide on their own 
to offer stock to the public. The agency said it will continue to process 
applications for standard conversions during the review. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud the OTS for its decision today to impose a moratorium on merger 
conversions, which are the most egregious type of conversion because the 
depositors . . . are not always able to purchase the savings bank stock, 
whereas the bank insiders always go home with their pockets lined," Gonzalez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to impose a similar temporary ban 
on merger conversions for mutual S&Ls. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC and OTS share responsibility for regulating the savings industry. 
</P>
<P>
 At a House banking subcommittee hearing last week, several lawmakers expressed 
concern that some insiders are getting rich in the deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting FDIC Chairman Andrew Hove promised the panel it will examine the 
conversions more closely. He said the agency is considering requiring special 
vouchers be issued to depositors when mutual savings institutions sell stock. 
The vouchers would let the holders buy stock, or they could be sold by 
depositors who so choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting OTS director Jonathan Fiechter said the moratorium will remain in 
effect until the agency drafts rules to protect depositors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual S&Ls have $250 billion in assets, about a fourth of the nation's 
savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 112 mutual S&Ls converted to publicly owned stock -- including 29 
that were bought by banks, industry groups reported. 
</P>
<P>
 OTS said managers of mutual thrift institutions often get lavish stock options 
and retirement pay when the S&Ls merge. It also said, acquiring banks can reap 
big profits by purchasing the mutual at a steep discount from its market value.

PACTEL THREATENS SUIT OVER FCC AWARDS; TECHNOLOGY: IT SAYS RIVALS WHO RECEIVED 
PCS LICENSES MAY HAVE BROKEN THE RULES THROUGH REPEATED CONTACT WITH THE 
AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When the Federal Communications Commission last year invited comment on rules 
to establish a new technology called wireless personal communications services, 
Pacific Telesis discovered that some of its competitors seemed especially eager 
to offer advice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two months leading up to a Dec. 23 decision awarding free franchises 
for the new technology, officials of two of the three winning firms were 
repeatedly in touch with the FCC, in possible violation of rules, PacTel 
complained last week. 
</P>
<P>
 PacTel, whose cellular phone business is threatened by the new PCS technology, 
called for a review and threatened to sue to overturn the award -- one of 
numerous challenges considered likely as this summer's high-stakes auction of 
further PCS franchises draws near. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the so-called pioneer's preference rule, by which those deemed to 
be technological leaders in a field are awarded free franchises while others 
must bid huge sums at an auction -- $250 million or more in the case of PCS. 
</P>
<P>
 The potentially lucrative franchises will launch businesses in a technology 
that will enable the transmission of voice, data and video communications via 
wireless transceivers that experts say will eventually be as portable and 
unobtrusive as a wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC voted last week to uphold the pioneer's preference rule. But 
Commissioner Ervin S. Duggan issued a statement warning of the policy's 
"potential dangers." He said those include "politicizing" the awards, 
difficulty in determining "what constitutes true innovation" and "being caught 
up in endless litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 PacTel complained that American Personal Communications of Washington huddled 
with FCC officials 25 times before winning a free franchise and that another 
firm, little Omnipoint Communications of Colorado Springs, Colo., contacted the 
FCC 11 times. 
</P>
<P>
 The contacts were permissible as long as they were limited to discussions 
about PCS technology. But in a five-page letter to the FCC on Friday, Pacific 
Telesis alleged that the discussions may have been aimed at influencing more 
important rule-making the FCC was undertaking at the time: a review of 
pioneer's preference rules themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three recipients of (PCS) awards . . . all made ex parte contacts" with 
the FCC, Michael K. Kellogg, a lawyer for Pacific Telesis, wrote in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the FCC had previously warned that failure to comply with its ex 
parte rules "could result in . . . (the) imposition of sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 concerns sought recognition for inventing PCS technology, but 
only three -- Omnipoint, American Personal Communications and Cox Enterprises 
of Atlanta -- received free licenses to provide PCS in Southern California and 
metropolitan New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Cox could not be reached. But American Personal Communications 
dismissed the allegation of improper FCC contact as "groundless," and Omnipoint 
President Douglas Smith said an overwhelming number of those who commented on 
the pioneer's preference rule supported Omnipoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not violate any ex parte rules, " said Smith, whose company employs 
about 100 people. "The fact that Pacific Telesis is bringing up an unfounded 
technicality as their objection shows you how weak their case is." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some critics say the PCS awards are less a reflection of the companies' 
inventiveness than of their influence in persuading FCC officials that they 
deserve credit for pioneering a technology that was being worked on by a host 
of firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also say the free licenses give the companies a huge competitive 
advantage over other firms that are expected to pay upward of $250 million each 
for similar licenses to operate on the public airwaves.  
</P>
<P>
 "This pioneer's preference is a stupid policy. The government doesn't go 
around setting aside oil leases for people who come up with an innovative way 
to drill for oil," said former FCC general counsel Henry Geller, who is now a 
private Washington communications lawyer for public interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Geller crusaded for such free awards when he worked for the FCC, but he now 
says his previous position was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the outcome the FCC envisioned when it adopted its pioneer's 
preference rule in 1991. The agency embraced the idea in an effort to reform a 
half-century-old license-approval process that many believed worked against 
entrepreneurs who had spent their time and money inventing new communications 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the early 1980s, the FCC allocated the airwaves through administrative 
hearings that subjectively evaluated competing applicants.OMNIPOINT

 McDonnell DC-X Rocket Gets Reprieve: McDonnell Douglas Corp. said its radical 
DC-X space-launch rocket, which was about to be mothballed after exhausting its 
initial government funding, will instead remain "in a readiness state" thanks 
to a $1-million infusion from NASA. In its first three flight tests last year, 
the DC-X fulfilled its goal of lifting off and then landing vertically, but 
plans for more flights were scrapped when the money ran out. NASA and the 
Defense Department will spend two months studying ways to finance the remaining 
tests, McDonnell said.

 Aetna Plan Draws Mixed Reviews: Aetna Life & Casualty Co.'s $1-billion 
restructuring plan was applauded by stock investors but criticized by rating 
agencies.Aetna's stock closed up $3.50 at $63.375 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange after some analysts recommended a buy. But Duff & Phelps downgraded 
the insurer's senior debt rating to AA-minus from AA amid concerns that the 
restructuring charges will weaken Aetna's earnings. A.M. Best Co. said it 
placed Aetna's "excellent" rating under review. The plan, unveiled Friday, 
involves 4,000 job cuts.

PERSONAL INCOME AND SPENDING INCREASE AT HEALTHY RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans' personal incomes and spending increased in 1993 at rates that 
economists see as harbingers of healthy expansion this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Incomes rose 4.7% last year, while inflation rose just 2.7%.Spending rose 
6.1%, the biggest increase since a 6.8 gain in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "These numbers do confirm a solid year of economic growth," said David Jones, 
an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. "There are hints that we ended the year 
on the stronger side, with a lot of momentum coming into 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest income and spending figures closely match economists' forecasts. 
For December, incomes rose 0.6% and spending rose 0.5%. 
</P>

 Northrop Plans B-2 Layoffs: The company said 1,300 employees who work on the 
B-2 stealth bomber will be laid off this year as the program continues to 
gradually wind down. About 75% of the layoffs will occur at Northrop's Pico 
Rivera plant, the rest at its Palmdale facility, spokesman Edward Smith said. 
Northrop previously has said it plans to close the Pico Rivera plant -- which 
currently employs 6,800 -- in the late 1990s as production of the 20 B-2s on 
order nears completion.

TOKYO STOCK MARKET POSTS HIGHEST GAIN IN THREE YEARS; JAPAN: BELIEF THAT 
DIFFERENCES ON ECONOMIC POLICY MAY SOON BE OVERCOME PUSH THE NIKKEI INDEX UP 
7.8% TO 20,229. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid one of the most powerful Japanese stock price surges ever, top leaders in 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's seven-party ruling coalition Monday 
struggled to resolve sharp policy differences that have blocked agreement on 
economic stimulus measures. 
</P>
<P>
 While the governing parties remain deeply split in their preferences on tax 
policy, expectations that those differences will soon be overcome contributed 
to the sharpest one-day increase in stock prices in more than three years.  
</P>
<P>
 The Nikkei-225 index shot up 1,471 points, or 7.8%, to close at 20,229, the 
highest level since Oct. 25. In terms of points, it was the third-largest 
one-day gain the market has ever seen. The jump was based on relief that the 
government had survived a crisis over political reform, and on belief that a 
massive stimulus package will soon be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 In trading today, the Nikkei closed its morning session up 224 points at 
20,453.  
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's Cabinet is due to announce later this week a package of income tax 
cuts and public spending worth at least $130 billion. There has been a fierce 
battle within the government, however, about whether the income tax cuts -- 
which would make up nearly half the package -- should be balanced by a 
consumption tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialist Party, the largest member of the coalition, opposes any increase 
in the consumption tax, which is similar to a sales tax and currently set at 
3%. The Ministry of Finance has insisted that it would be highly irresponsible 
to do anything less than raise the consumption tax enough to cover the revenue 
losses from an income tax cut. Most parties in the coalition favor cutting 
income taxes first, then raising the consumption tax within one to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument is in part a debate over tax reform as opposed to economic 
stimulus. The Ministry of Finance is looking many years ahead, to the aging of 
Japanese society. Its belief is that part of the tax burden must be shifted 
from the declining number of people in their working years to free-spending 
consumers of any age. 
</P>
<P>
 If tax cuts and increases are balanced from the beginning, that should be good 
for government finances, but the stimulative effect of the package could be 
seriously weakened. The Clinton Administration, wishing to see Japanese 
economic growth that would pull in U.S. exports, has spoken out forcefully in 
favor of highly stimulative tax policy and against the approach favored by the 
Ministry of Finance.

KHAN CONCEDES DEFEAT IN EFFORT TO OUST ICN CHAIRMAN PANIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rafi M. Khan, the dissident investor seeking to oust the chairman of ICN 
Pharmaceuticals Inc., conceded defeat Monday but vowed to keep pressing for 
management changes at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders are to vote at the company's annual meeting today on a proposal 
to replace Chairman Milan Panic and the other eight ICN board members with a 
new six-member slate that would include Khan, who owns 120,000 shares of the 
pharmaceutical company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may lose, but I am not a quitter," said Khan, who is also wrestling with 
criminal allegations that surfaced as a result of ICN's efforts to discredit 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan launched his effort to unseat Panic in April, accusing the 63-year-old 
chairman of drawing an excessive salary and of breaking federal laws by 
managing the Costa Mesa-based firm while serving as prime minister of his 
homeland, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Khan's campaign for changes in ICN's boardroom was all but scuttled when 
questions arose about his own past, including allegations that he fled the 
United Kingdom under a cloud of suspicion that he was involved in a securities 
scam to defraud the British government. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN officials, who had long predicted they would easily win the shareholder 
vote, responded to Khan's statement Monday with guarded enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate his concession," ICN spokesman David Calef said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company will not back off from its feud with Khan, whom it charges in 
a lawsuit with using inside information to wage a proxy fight, Calef said. ICN 
has already spent millions of dollars to fend off Khan's challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many investors share Khan's displeasure with ICN's management, the 
largest institutional shareholders, who control more than 10% of the company's 
stock, are expected to stand behind Panic. Some observers estimate that ICN can 
expect to garner 70% of the shares voted today, compared to the 30% pledged to 
Khan.

NEW SOROS FUND AND GE CAPITAL TO INVEST IN ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GE Capital Corp. and the fund group headed by George Soros, the Wall Street 
billionaire and philanthropist, are joining forces to invest in electric power 
plants in developing countries, the two sides announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Global Power Investments will raise at least $2.5 billion and invest 
it in building or running privately owned power plants, the partners said. The 
fund will initially focus on Mexico and Asia, particularly China, India and 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the rapid economic growth of numerous emerging markets around the world, 
this is an opportune time to invest in electrical power generating plants and 
to help facilitate their construction," said Gary Wendt, chairman of GE 
Capital, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Both GE Capital and Quantum Industrial Holdings, a new fund that will be 
managed by Soros Fund Management, will put up $200 million for the new fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Finance Corporation, the private financing arm of the World 
Bank, has signed a letter of intent to add $50 million to the new venture. The 
rest of the money will be raised from other investors. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital has $4.5 billion in investments in electric power projects, most in 
the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett J. Santos, a director with the International Finance Corp., said, 
"Foreign private investment is important for the growth of the power sector in 
developing countries. The demand for electricity can no longer be satisfied 
through financing from public sector sources or multilateral lending agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 While Soros is deeply involved in humanitarian efforts and projects supporting 
democracy in Eastern Europe, his new fund will be aimed at making profits for 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Soros' six investment funds have net assets of $12 billion and invest in 
stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and real estate. He is considered the 
highest-paid person on Wall Street, earning at least $650 million in 1992 from 
his fees and his stake in his investment funds, according to Financial World 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Published reports have said Soros' flagship Quantum fund earned a 65% to 70% 
return for investors last year. A spokesman for the company would not provide 
exact figures but said those numbers were in the correct range. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Soros fund plans to raise up to $1.4 billion from investors in four of 
its other funds. It may invest in other electric power generation projects in 
addition to Global Power Investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Soros' other funds, the new fund will be off-shore, closed to U.S. 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital is a subsidiary of General Electric Co., based in Stamford, Conn.

PEOPLE: LOCKHART NAMED PRESIDENT OF MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MasterCard International on Monday named Eugene Lockhart, a banking consultant 
who once ran a major credit card operation in Britain, its new president and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment came a week after the unexpected announcement that Alex W. 
(Pete) Hart, was leaving to run Advanta Corp., a major credit card issuer based 
in Horsham, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart, 43, has been executive vice president of First Manhattan Consulting 
Group since 1992 and prior to that spent six years at Midland Bank PLC in 
London, where he served as chief executive of U.K. banking and group 
operations. At Midland, Lockhart oversaw domestic banking, which included 3 
million credit cards and 1 1/2 million debit cards in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart also has been an executive at Marsh & McLennan Companies, a major 
commercial insurer, and the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart was widely respected throughout the credit card industry for 
reinvigorating MasterCard. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart served as chairman of the London Clearing House for Automatic 
Payments, which handles electronic payments. 
</P>
<P>
 He also served on a recent MasterCard task force concerning the future of 
debit cards, which allow consumers to deduct money from checking accounts 
instead of credit lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart's appointment will be effective March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 MasterCard, an association for banks that issue cards under the brand name, 
was accepted in more than 10.6 million locations and generated more than $258 
billion in transactions worldwide in 1992, the most recent figures available. 
Visa International had $458 billion in charge volume in 1992.

 California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest public 
pension fund with $80 billion in assets, named Sheryl Pressler chief investment 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler currently directs the $5.3-billion pension fund at the St. Louis 
aerospace giant McDonnell Douglas Corp. At CalPERS, she will succeed DeWitt 
Bowman, who is retiring after almost five years in the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler, who was unavailable for comment, will be responsible for deciding 
what percentage of assets should go into stocks, bonds and other instruments 
and for recommending specific investments to the fund's 13-member board. She 
will also supervise in-house money managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman has seen assets almost double and has been responsible for drastic 
changes in the fund's investments. Under Bowman, the fund began investing in 
international equities and bonds, which now account for about 16% of total 
assets.

SUPPLY, DEMAND OF REAL ESTATE ARE SHAKEN UP; EARTHQUAKE: HOME SALES BOOMS ARE 
CREATED AWAY FROM THE EPICENTER. APARTMENT RENTALS HAVE ALSO SOARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the October wildfire that razed more than 300 homes in Laguna Beach, the 
Jan. 17 earthquake that turned so many lives upside-down has also upended 
supply and demand in the Los Angeles-area housing market, bringing unlikely 
relief to many long-suffering property owners but only renewed grief to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and landlords whose wallets have been thinning for months because 
they were not able to sell their vacant houses or rent empty apartments say 
that they are now besieged by tenants displaced by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, buyers who want to avoid Northridge and other communities at the 
quake's epicenter are spilling over into surrounding areas, creating a 
mini-sales boom from Woodland Hills to Agoura on the west and across the San 
Gabriel Valley in the east, real estate agents say. 
</P>
<P>
 The same sort of phenomenon occurred in Laguna Beach in the aftermath of last 
fall's 17,000-acre brush fire that destroyed 366 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a sizable amount of standing inventory removed from the market right 
after the fire" by victims looking for temporary housing, said Jim Vermilya, 
manager of the Grubb & Ellis-Better Homes & Gardens Realty office in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of homes that had been for sale for a long time but hadn't sold 
because of the soft market were grabbed up by fire victims determined to stay 
in Laguna Beach while their homes were being rebuilt, he said. Vermilya said 
his office "leased more than 100 units," most of them for one-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake, however, had little apparent impact on real estate activity in 
Orange County, according to brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to order a couple of reinspections on properties that were in escrow," 
said broker Sharon Larson of Prudential California Realty in Fullerton. "But 
that was for people moving here from out of the country. We didn't have any 
sales drop out of escrow; in fact, the day of the earthquake was a pretty good 
day for us. People here (in Orange County) have taken it pretty much in 
stride." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Los Angeles, many home shoppers have retreated to the sidelines while 
the ground continues to shake from aftershocks. And hundreds of home sales are 
in limbo because lenders are insisting that properties be reinspected for 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some opportunists have rushed in, hoping to pick up a bargain in a housing 
market that only recently had emerged from a prolonged and severe recession. 
Harried salespeople and lenders are working overtime, helping the new clients 
while trying to salvage the deals already in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like trying to navigate through the Bermuda Triangle," said Jamie 
Ramstead, a Northridge real estate agent trying to save the six sales he has in 
escrow while also repairing $60,000 in damage to his home. "Most of us have 
never been through something like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake rendered more than 15,000 homes and apartments unlivable, throwing 
more than 30,000 people onto streets from Santa Monica to Simi Valley, 
according to city agencies and disaster relief officials. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many families looking for new places to live, sellers who have lost 
thousands of dollars while their vacant homes sat unsold in a depressed market 
have been flooded with calls from prospective renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Kennedy has been making the $950-a-month mortgage payment on her home in 
Canoga Park that she vacated last July after finding a new job in Oregon. The 
house sustained little damage from the quake, so she flew back to Los Angeles 
last week and leased it to a displaced Northridge family for $1,850 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure I'll recoup what I've lost by the summer, and then I'll be making 
good money because the family signed a one-year lease," said Kennedy, who 
reviews contracts for the federal government.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for all those people who lost their homes, but it's nice to 
finally make something off this house. The last six months have bled me dry." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has also been a boon for sellers in many San Fernando Valley 
communities that were spared the most serious damage. Thus, some would-be 
buyers are steering clear of hard-hit Northridge and Reseda in favor of nearby 
Woodland Hills and north into southern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Bolin, sales manager of the Coldwell Banker real estate office in 
Woodland Hills, said his agents sold a half-dozen properties over weekend -- 
even though many buyers stayed home to watch the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the quake, we'd be happy with just three or four sales," Bolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many put their home-buying plans on ice after the quake hit, some new 
buyers have moved in to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Lipson, vice president of an executive search firm, lost her 
$535-a-month rent-controlled Santa Monica apartment in the quake. Because it 
would cost her twice that for a comparable apartment, she wants to buy a 
condominium, hoping her mortgage-interest deductions will keep her overall 
housing expenses at a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good deals on the West Side right now," Lipson said. As a 
bonus, she added, "it's a little easier to tell which buildings are well-built. 
Some of them have just fallen apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not all of those new buyers are being welcomed by real estate agents or 
their sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Lamb, co-owner of Century 21 Lamb Realty in Northridge, said she and 
her staff have gotten several calls from investors hoping to pick up homes at a 
tiny fraction of their normal prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten our share of bottom-feeders, but they're not having much 
success," said Lamb, whose home also sustained major damage during the quake. 
"The law says that we have to present their offers to our sellers, but there's 
nothing that says we have to like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many buyers and sellers who were waiting for escrow to close when the quake 
hit are in limbo. About 1,000 deals were pending in the San Fernando Valley 
when the earthquake struck, according to the local Realtors' association. A few 
hundred were in escrow in Santa Monica and adjacent communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lenders are requiring every house that they had agreed to finance in the 
county be reinspected for damage. As a result, some appraisers and inspectors 
have been busy taking a second look at properties more than 75 miles away from 
the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house I'm buying in Sherman Oaks didn't get hurt a bit, but I can't close 
the deal because my (appraiser) is busy looking at houses down in Long Beach," 
grumbled Nick Smith, who drives a delivery truck. "The whole thing is stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side is Rhoark Rollband in Encino, who had been trying to sell 
his condominium for nearly a year before the earthquake hit, and had already 
reduced the asking price for his two-bedroom loft to $124,000 from $129,000. 
The local housing market was showing signs of picking up, and he was confident 
the home would sell soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rollband's unit weathered the quake well, the temblor damaged several 
other buildings at the sprawling complex on White Oak Avenue and knocked out 
gas service for nearly two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Now he has slashed his price again -- this time to $109,000 -- and is willing 
to take even less to make a quick sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meet my price, and I'll even throw in my furniture," said Rollband, a 
salesman who says the quake finally persuaded him that it is time to move to 
Denver. "I just want to cut my losses and get out of L.A. as fast as I can."

 Infinity Reportedly Cleared to Buy KRTH-FM: The Federal Communications 
Commission today will announce that Infinity Broadcasting Corp. can proceed 
with plans to buy the big Los Angeles radio station, the New York Times 
reported in today's editions.The FCC's 2-1 vote came despite the agency's 
concern about purported indecent on-air remarks made by radio personality and 
Infinity employee Howard Stern, which also are the subject of at least two 
indecency complaints filed by the public. But the FCC's decision also levies an 
additional $400,000 in fines on Infinity, which already has been fined $1.2 
million by the commission in recent years because of Stern's comments, the 
newspaper said. Infinity is fighting the fines in court.

TAKECARE EXECUTIVES DEFEND ACTIONS IN SALE TO FHP OF FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>

<P>
 TakeCare Inc., which FHP Inc. in Fountain Valley is trying to acquire, said 
Monday that it has filed court documents denying shareholder accusations that 
top executives were trying to enrich themselves by arranging the pending sale. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP said last month that it offered to pay $829 million in cash and stock for 
its Concord competitor, which was less than the total value of a stock swap 
offered by United HealthCare Corp. in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP offered $62 a share in cash and stock, while United HealthCare offered 
$64.50 a share in an all-stock transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of TakeCare shareholders, led by a wealthy Pittsburgh family, filed a 
lawsuit alleging that the board majority rejected a better offer because the 
FHP deal would provide top TakeCare managers with more personal cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But TakeCare attorneys argued that executives acted properly in the FHP deal 
and had shareholders' interests in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, FHP spokeswoman Ria Carlson said that her company was continuing its 
work to acquire TakeCare. Carlson said she expects the deal to become final by 
June. JAMES M. GOMEZ

APPOINT TECHNOLOGIES SELLS A FORECLOSED UNIT, BUYS AMT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Appoint Technologies Inc. said Monday that one of its two units had been 
placed into foreclosure and sold back to its founder. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said it has completed the purchase of Huntington Beach-based 
AMT International Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's Appoint Inc. unit in Paso Robles was placed into foreclosure 
after sustaining continued operating losses. The unit was then sold to John B. 
Barrett, a founder of Appoint Inc. and a former vice chairman of Appoint 
Technologies, for $655,922. 
</P>
<P>
 Appoint Technologies will account for the dissolution, it said, by taking a 
charge against earnings in the fourth quarter to reflect a loss of goodwill 
associated with Appoint Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Appoint Technologies said it has completed its acquisition 
of AMT International, which makes products for use with personal computers, 
including a line of credit-card-sized modems for use with laptops. The company, 
now called AMT StarComm Inc., has 40 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 E.W. Baumgardner, Appoint Technology chairman, said no decision has been made 
about future staffing for the new company. 
</P>
<P>
 AMT was acquired through foreclosure after it defaulted on an $800,000 loan 
from Appoint Inc. The estimated value of the assets acquired is about $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Appoint Technologies said it will take a fourth-quarter charge to reflect the 
difference between the loan and the net assets received. 
</P>
<P>
 Baumgardner said the size of the two charges have not been determined.

ARMOR ALL BUYS LINE OF HOME PRODUCTS; GROWTH: MOVE ALLOWS AUTOMOTIVE GOODS FIRM 
TO DIVERSIFY AND ESTABLISH A HOME-CARE DIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Armor All Products Corp. stepped out of the car and into the home on Monday 
with the purchase of a line of products from a Tallahassee, Fla., company. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Agri-Products Special Markets Inc., sold Armor All its E-Z D and 
E-Z Deck Wash brands. The products restore wood decks and home siding. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase "establishes our new home-care division, providing us with an 
umbrella for future growth in non-automotive products," said Kenneth M. Evans, 
president and chief executive officer of Armor All.  
</P>
<P>
 He added that a key growth strategy is to broaden the company's line of 
consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 Armor All's move is a good one from an investor's viewpoint, said Mark 
Matheson, an analyst with the Crowell, Weedon & Co. brokerage in Los Angeles. 
"I like it," he said. "One of the things that held back their stock is they 
were seen as a one-category company. This will diversify their risk." 
</P>
<P>
 It also allows the company to leverage its strength in the consumer 
advertising and marketing arenas, Matheson pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock was up 75 cents in Nasdaq trading Monday, to close at 
$21.75 exchange -- a 52-week high for Armor All. 
</P>
<P>
 E-Z Deck Wash is a leading manufacturer of exterior wood deck cleaning and 
restoring products, Armor All said, with a 65% market share. When applied to 
weathered, gray wood decks, fences and siding, E-Z Deck Wash cleans stains from 
mildew, algae and fungus while removing the grayness. 
</P>
<P>
 Other products include E-Z D brand cleaners: vinyl and stucco wash, pre-paint 
house wash, roof wash and aluminum wash. The products are sold in home centers, 
hardware stores and lumber and building material stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Armor All, which is best known for Armor All Protectant, also markets 
automotive waxes and polishes, carwash products and car cleaners, which are 
sold under the Armor All and Rain Dance brands. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first half of its 1994 fiscal year, Armor All reported profit of 
$9.5 million on revenue of $84 million. Armor All Products

TECHNOLOGY: ON SUPERHIGHWAY, IN CYPERSPACE, THE BUZZ IS ON DIGITAL HUGENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Does anyone talk about the "global village" anymore? How about high-definition 
television? 
</P>
<P>
 Those buzzwords of years past have been drowned out by newer descriptions of 
techno-paradise: virtual reality, the Internet, cyberspace, cyberpunk, the 
information highway and superhighway, the digital highway, the electronic 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the names stick, and sometimes they fade out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a new word here for it all: Digital Hugeness, " said Martin Alper, 
president of Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc., a video game publisher in 
Irvine. "It reminds us there is a lot of hype out there, and we have to 
translate that hype into reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Alper's company makes interactive games and other products for the digital 
future -- whatever it might be called. Alper isn't fond of the highway 
metaphors, which he says will disappear in a year or so. Virtual reality has 
real applications, so it deserves the heavy usage. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes "cyberpunk," but only as it reminds him of a specific science-fiction 
theme that focuses on the computer hacker culture such as in William Gibson's 
"Neuromancer." And 500-channel interactive television reminds him of Bruce 
Springsteen's song, "57 Channels and Nothin' On." 
</P>
<P>
 So Digital Hugeness may have to do.

MONTGOMERY WARD TO PAY $310,000 IN FALSE AD SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Montgomery Ward & Co., the huge Chicago-based retailing chain, has agreed to 
pay $310,000 in civil penalties to settle a false-advertising lawsuit filed in 
June by the Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third time in a decade that the company has been ordered by 
California courts to halt misleading advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's settlement includes a permanent injunction that applies to all of the 
company's stores in California and prohibits misleading advertising tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Those tactics include increasing retail prices before applying discounts, 
adding items in advertised sale lists that are not offered at reduced prices, 
and stating that items are on sale for a limited time when the sale actually 
lasts much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Montgomery Ward could not be reached for comment. In agreeing to 
pay the fine and accept the injunction, the company did not admit any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Shade, the Orange County deputy district attorney who handled the case, 
said the civil complaint involved advertising campaigns as far back at 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the case was developed in conjunction with the Sacramento district 
attorney's office, which had obtained a similar injunction against Montgomery 
Ward in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting complaints from consumers," Shade said, "and we knew that 
there were two prior injunctions. We felt they weren't living up to them, so we 
decided to look at the situation again." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 1990 Sacramento County action, the chain was sued by the 
state attorney general's office in the early 1980s and was ordered by the court 
in that case to cease similarly misleading advertising tactics, Shade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County court order also requires Montgomery Ward to document all 
price reductions and maintain that documentation and copies of all sale 
advertisements for at least two years for review by the attorney general's 
office or any district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Montgomery Ward has stores in Buena Park, Fullerton, 
Huntington Beach, Santa Ana and Mission Viejo.

VIDEO GAME FIRM INVESTS IN START-UP; TECHNOLOGY: IRVINE'S INTERPLAY PRODUCTIONS 
HAS ACQUIRED A MINORITY STAKE IN PALO ALTO-BASED NORTHSTAR STUDIOS, WHICH IS 
DEVELOPING FUTURISTIC 'INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT' SOFTWARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Interplay Productions Inc., the second-largest video game publisher in Orange 
County, said Monday that it had acquired a minority stake in a Northern 
California start-up headed by a veteran of the video game industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Interplay said it invested an undisclosed amount of money and technology in 
Northstar Studios in Palo Alto, which is developing futuristic "interactive 
entertainment" software for video games. The deal calls for Northstar to 
develop games for Interplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Northstar was started in December by Ronald Spitzer, 33, who has worked as an 
executive and manager at several computer game companies. Most recently, he was 
licensing director for Crystal Dynamics Inc. in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ronald has a great ability to land key development talent," said Brian Fargo, 
president of Irvine-based Interplay. "This is a strategic move for us. We 
expect he will deliver a series of games that we will market over a period of 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Interplay's investment in Northstar Studios follows an industry trend for 
managing rising game development costs. Companies are teaming up with allies, 
subcontractors or investors, especially in preparation for the coming age of 
interactive games and TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Such alliances come in different forms. Two weeks ago, Blockbuster Video 
Entertainment invested $30 million in Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc., 
which is Orange County's largest video game company with 250 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 These deals are an acknowledgment of a coming convergence of digital 
industries, including Hollywood films, video game publishing, cable TV, 
consumer electronics and computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 Spitzer also has worked for Electronic Arts in San Mateo and in 1986 was a 
founder of New World Computing, which created the "Might & Magic" fantasy game 
series that sold more than 800,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northstar, Spitzer is rounding up a team of talented game developers from 
around North America, with offices in Texas, Northern California and on the 
East Coast. He envisions a company of about 100 people in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is to tap into the talent where they want to live," he said. "I don't 
want to be a publisher. Been there, done that. I want to develop great 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers manufacture, market and distribute games; developers create them. 
He has already recruited game producer Nicholas Beliaeff, who produced "Tony 
LaRussa Baseball" and the "Eye of the Beholder" computer game series. 
</P>
<P>
 Northstar is specializing in developing software for game systems that process 
data in 32-bit chunks. Such systems, which can process data much faster than 
the original 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System, are being developed by major 
industry players. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's 32-bit systems, including the recently launched 3DO "multi-player" and 
the Atari Corp.'s Jaguar machine, can run software faster and feature better 
quality graphics than conventional 16-bit systems such as the Sega Genesis or 
the Nintendo Super Entertainment System. Sega and Nintendo are also planning to 
launch game systems that can process data in 32 bits or larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Interplay is a 10-year-old private company founded by Fargo with 1993 sales 
estimated at $60 million. Its current hits include compact disc games entitled 
"Star Trek: The 25th Anniversary" and "Lord of the Rings."

YUEN BUYS BIG STAKE IN SOUND INNOVATOR; TECHNOLOGY: THE AST RESEARCH CO-FOUNDER 
GAINS CONTROLLING INTEREST IN YOUNG NEWPORT BEACH-BASED SRS LABS, WHICH HAS A 
SYSTEM THAT DISTRIBUTES NOISE IN THREE DIMENSIONS. 
</P>

 Thomas C.K. Yuen, who made a fortune as one of the founders of computer maker 
AST Research Inc., said Monday that he has bought a majority stake in a young 
Orange County company striving to create the successor to stereo sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuen invested $2.71 million in SRS Labs Inc., a 7-month-old Newport Beach 
company. He will have a controlling interest and assume the titles of chairman 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 SRS purchased a novel sound technology developed by Hughes Aircraft Co., which 
decided last year to sell its sound retrieval system -- SRS -- to focus on its 
core aerospace business. The system distributes sound in three dimensions, 
taking it from standard stereo speakers and enriching it so that the listener 
has the impression of being immersed in it, said Stephen Sedmak, president of 
SRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuen, a computer marketing maverick, co-founded AST in 1981 and helped it grow 
to a billion-dollar company. He resigned in 1992 after a power struggle with 
co-founder Safi U. Qureshey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking into the multimedia area, which is in an emerging stage, 
and I stumbled on this company and its technology," Yuen said in an interview 
Monday. "The staff gave me a demonstration. But even though I have a hearing 
problem, it sounded great." 
</P>
<P>
 Sedmak, a part-owner, will remain as president and the top executive for 
day-to-day management. Yuen will act as a business adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "This accelerates our ability to establish SRS as a standard," Sedmak said. 
"We will use Tom's connections in the industry and his stature to reach our 
goals more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Investment banker Walter Cruttenden III will relinquish the title of chairman 
but remain an investor and board member, Sedmak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has seven employees, including Arnold Klayman, the inventor of 
SRS. Klayman, 67, spent 25 years developing sound technology at his small 
research company in Costa Mesa. Hughes bought the technology in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The first product was a component that adapted ordinary stereo systems so they 
could sport SRS sound. Since June, SRS Labs has licensed its technology to 
companies designing components for for personal computers and video games. 
</P>

 Among the titles that Virgin Interactive has in development is a video game 
version of "The Lion King," based on an upcoming Walt Disney Co. animated 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin collaborated with Disney and Sega of America Inc. to create a video 
game based on the movie Aladdin. Now Alper says that cooperation, led by a 
15-person Virgin development team in Las Vegas, is being taken further in the 
Lion King project. 
</P>
<P>
 Alper says Disney tells him that the new film may top Aladdin in box-office 
receipts. If that is the case, the video game could be published this fall on 
both the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis formats, only a few months after the 
movie's summer release.

VIRGINIA LAWMAKERS BACK AWAY FROM DISNEY AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BAKER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawmakers said Monday that they plan to withdraw a proposal to have Prince 
William County borrow up to $50 million for water and sewer lines for a Walt 
Disney Co. theme park, saying they are looking at other options, including 
asking the company to pay for the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The company might be asked to put up the money and possibly recover it over 
time through tax breaks, said Delegate Harry J. Parrish (R-Manassas), a chief 
sponsor of Virginia Gov. George Allen's incentive package to help Disney build 
the park near Haymarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a switch would be a change to Allen's original proposal and a clear sign 
that Disney's America park faces a tougher time in the General Assembly than 
many originally predicted. Parrish said he will make a final decision after a 
meeting today of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, but he said 
that "we'll probably just strike the bills" from the docket. 
</P>
<P>
 Theme park opponents reacted with predictable support of the proposals, saying 
the state should not subsidize Disney's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The delegates and senators are hearing from back home. That's what's changing 
the landscape," said Robert Elliott, spokesman for Protect, a Prince 
William-based group opposing the park. Elliott said the group sent 50 people to 
lobby the legislators last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's proposed package calls for the state to spend $163.2 million for road 
improvements on and around the 3,000-acre site, relocation costs and a tourism 
promotional program. 
</P>
<P>
 While embracing the idea of luring Disney to Virginia, some legislators have 
complained that Allen gave away too much in negotiations with the 
multibillion-dollar corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Three studies by Disney, park opponents and the state have produced varying 
forecasts of the tax revenue and jobs that the park and its spinoff commercial 
and residential development would produce.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: COMPUTER SYSTEMS SUPPLIER REPORTS 1ST-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Automation Inc.: The supplier of business computer systems reported a 
profit for its first quarter, contrasted with a loss of $290,000 in the 
comparable period the year before. The Anaheim-based company said it had a net 
income of $109,000, or 1 cent per share, on sales of $8.2 million for the 
quarter ended Dec. 31.This compares with a loss of $290,000, or 3 cents per 
share, on sales of $11.1 million in the comparable quarter of the previous 
year. "These results . . . indicate that the plans we put into place a year ago 
are indeed driving the company to profitability," said Len Mackenzie, company 
president. An element of that plan is the concentration of sales and marketing 
efforts on the company's Zebra 2000 computer system for libraries and its 
Maxial 2000 computer system for the hospitality industry.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: PIONEER BANCORP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The holding company for Pioneer Bank on Friday reported a loss of $9.1 million 
for 1993, compared to a $1.9-million loss in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer Bancorp said most of last year's loss was attributable to bad loans 
and to real estate it wound up owning after having to foreclose. The 
Fullerton-based bank said it had to set aside $10.9 million during the year to 
cover those losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank said it improved its operating profitability enough to seek new 
capital. Pioneer said it had hired an investment banker in December to help it 
find new investors.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: GLENDALE FEDERAL CUTS LOSS TO $39.8 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Federal Bank said it cut its fiscal second-quarter loss in half from 
a year earlier, to $39.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale-based savings and loan attributed the loss in the latest quarter, 
which compared with a loss of $79.4 million in the same quarter a year earlier, 
to a large provision for loan losses and a decline in interest income from 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first six months ended Dec. 31, Glendale posted a loss of $59.7 
million, compared with a loss of $96.2 million during the same period in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Stephen J. Trafton, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Glendale Federal, said its troubled loans and foreclosed real estate have 
continued to decline. However, Glendale Federal also estimated that it has $1.5 
billion in real estate loans in the earthquake-affected areas of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Federal, which completed a $451-million recapitalization last fall, 
said the Office of Thrift Supervision declared on Dec. 31 that the thrift was 
adequately capitalized, meaning that it had sufficient money on hand to guard 
against sudden losses.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: GREAT WESTERN REPORTS LOSS OF $18.9 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Great Western Financial Corp. of Chatsworth reported a fourth-quarter loss of 
$18.9 million, compared with a loss of $97.3 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, the parent company of Great Western Bank said it turned a 
profit of $62 million, down 27% from a profit of $85 million in 1992.Great 
Western said its latest quarter loss was due to provisions for real estate and 
loan losses of $149 million, and restructuring charges of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring includes the elimination of 1,000 jobs, half through 
layoffs. As a result of the restructuring, the company said it expects annual 
savings of more than $100 million beginning in 1995. James F. Montgomery, 
chairman and chief executive officer, also said he did not expect a "material 
loss" from the recent Northridge earthquake. Great Western's assets as of Dec. 
31 were $38.3 billion, about the same as a year ago.

 Micropolis Corp., a Chatsworth maker of computer disk drives, reported a 
fourth-quarter loss of $6 million in contrast to a profit of $4.8 million for

Micropolis said the first quarter's results will include charges of up to $1 
million related to the recent earthquake.

QUESTIONS, DELAYS STRAIN QUAKE-FRAYED NERVES; REBUILDING: CONSUMERS ARE GROWING 
FRUSTRATED BY THE INABILITY TO GET QUICK ANSWERS FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES, 
LENDERS AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Like thousands of others whose lives were disrupted by the big quake, David L. 
Blender isn't sure where the money will come from to rebuild his badly damaged 
home in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 What's unusual in Blender's case is that he's a tax attorney, highly 
experienced in analyzing a contract's fine print. But when it comes to the 
earthquake coverage on his two-story house, he's uncertain about the exact 
obligation of his insurer, 20th Century Insurance Co., based in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Blender's house on Jumilla Avenue was hit so hard that an engineer he hired 
says the structure should be stripped to the studs and rebuilt with shearing 
walls instead of dry walls, which split badly in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, I read everything in a contract," Blender says. "That's my job. But 
to tell you the truth, I'm not sure whether 20th Century has to help rebuild 
the house properly in light of what we now know. If we went back to dry wall, 
I'd be fearful for my family's safety." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to an engineer, Blender has hired an architect and a contractor. 
He's also been visited by a 20th Century claims adjuster, who told him he'd be 
hearing from the company soon. Meanwhile, Blender, his wife and their two 
children are living in a rented trailer nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm not mad at anybody. But if I don't hear from 20th Century in 
another week, my patience will be getting short," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two weeks after the disaster, people are still confused about how to 
raise the money to rebuild their homes and their lives. Many are just angry -- 
at insurers, the federal government, lending institutions, even, to an extent, 
at fellow victims who are receiving emergency assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bernie Sherman, a career counselor at North Hollywood High School, drives 
past the parks where earthquake victims are being fed and sheltered in tent 
cities, he thinks about the extensive damage inflicted on his house in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't object to the free food and the tents and all the rest," he said. 
"But then I think, 'Hey, I'm the giant middle class. My block wall is down. 
I've got cracks everywhere. The dishes and china are gone. What about me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 His earthquake policy with 20th Century has several deductibles: $22,000 on 
the structure of his house, $15,000 for damage of personal property, and 
another deductible for other structures on his property. There are so many 
earthquake deductibility clauses that "I question whether I'll get a penny" 
from the insurance company, Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my income is too high for me to get a FEMA loan, so I decided to call 
my mortgage holder. Maybe they'd give me some kind of moratorium on my 
payments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A customer service representative at Fleet Mortgage Corp. in Milwaukee assured 
Sherman that the firm would understand and that there'd be no penalty charge if 
he was late with his mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I asked her to put it in writing, she turned me over to somebody who 
filled in the details," Sherman said. "They were willing to give me a 
moratorium until June 1. But after that, I'd have to make either a payment and 
a half, or a double payment every month until I was caught up. They weren't 
sure which it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mobile home where Carol and Tony De Lill lived in Santa Clarita, the 
walls were twisted out of shape, the hardwood parquet flooring was ruined by 
water, and, among other valuables, the couple lost a prized set of Austrian 
leaded crystal figurines. 
</P>
<P>
 An adjuster from Foremost Insurance Co., a Grand Rapids, Mich., firm that 
specializes in mobile home coverage, estimated the total loss at $14,000, Carol 
De Lill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's ridiculous, far less than it will cost to get the place back in 
shape," she declared. "The man said it would cost only $3,200 to replace our 
ruined siding -- exactly what I told him we paid to install it six or eight 
years ago." The De Lills have consulted an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Woodland Hills home of Jan and Paul Holtzman, the quake caused ceilings 
to collapse, badly damaged the chimney and blew out windows as well as starting 
a mattress fire. "A lamp fell on the mattress and somehow caught it on fire," 
Jan Holtzman said. "We dragged the mattress out of the house and tossed it into 
the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 That put out the fire, but the Holtzmans are still smoldering. They haven't 
heard about an emergency federal loan they've applied for. And, even though 
they filed an earthquake insurance claim by telephone, they've had no word from 
their insurance agency, which they declined to identify. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't left the house since the earthquake," Jan Holtzman said. "I'm 
afraid I'll miss a call from one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ari Levy, a clinical psychologist, didn't suffer a lot of damage at his 
home in North Hills, but he reported losing income because patients couldn't 
get to his office nearby in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 When he called Bank of America to seek a moratorium on his home mortgage 
payments, he said he was told that he could skip his next three payments, but 
that he would have to make a quadruple payment in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," he said. "I said, "And you call this a moratorium?' 
Naturally, I didn't accept their offer." 
</P>
<P>
 A Bank of America spokesman, Adrian Rodriguez, explained: "This must have been 
a loan that we'd issued initially but later sold to a secondary lender. We 
still service many of those loans but must follow the secondary lender's 
policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said BofA is trying to be flexible with quake victims seeking 
moratoriums on loan payments. Each case is handled on its merits, he said. 
"There's no set policy, but I can assure you we're not insisting on four 
payments at once on our own loans." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all quake victims are dissatisfied with the treatment they've received. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Goodman of Reseda went to an Allstate Insurance claims center in 
Woodland Hills and an adjuster handed him a $5,000 check "just on my say-so 
that our house was in bad shape and we needed to move into a hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 A Foremost Insurance adjuster gave Teri Nelson $1,600 to help her move out of 
her damaged mobile home in Canyon Country. "He's also allowing me $25 a day, 
even though I'm staying with my daughter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A construction firm is supposed to visit Nelson's home in a few days to 
arrange repairs. Like tax attorney Blender, however, Nelson is troubled about 
what lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our unit was on jacks," she said. "Two of the jacks came through the kitchen 
floor. They could have killed me. I wish the code could be changed so they'd 
have to build me an earthquake-proof foundation."

SHOPPING AROUND FOR STORES OPEN FOR BUSINESS; RETAIL: CONSUMERS FIND THEIR 
OPTIONS LIMITED IN THE WAKE OF THE NORTHRIDGE TEMBLOR. MANY STORES THAT ARE 
OPEN ARE LURING NEW CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping, according to bumper sticker 
lore. But given all the earthquake damage, where do Valley shoppers go? 
</P>
<P>
 Their choices are somewhat limited. In hard-hit Northridge, a Target, Mervyn's 
and Kmart are closed. The battered Northridge Fashion Center won't reopen for 
about six months, some of its department stores for more than a year. Also 
closed for about a month are the mall shops of Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood 
and the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, where the top floor of a Bullock's caved 
in. Three San Fernando Valley Sav-On stores are closed, along with their 
pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
 So for many local residents, the hunt is on for places to shop. And for the 
retailers that have managed to reopen, there is the opportunity to win some new 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among the people out in Northridge, I don't know that there's a great amount 
of understanding where we are located," said Allen Oblow, general manager of 
the Media City Center mall in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 So the shopping center is running newspaper and radio ads. It has banners hung 
outside announcing that it's open. Many people have called to ask for 
directions, so Oblow plans to include a locater map in the next series of ads. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past several days, traffic at the mall has increased 15% to 20% for 
this time of the year, and last weekend its corridors were crowded. Customers 
literally bumped against each other in Bullock's and at Ikea, a big home 
furnishings store. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's just a temporary thing and we can help people out, that's great," 
said Oblow. "If it becomes a permanent thing, that's great too." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolette Abernathy, Glendale Galleria marketing director, the largest 
shopping center in the Valley area, is hoping for a similar pickup in business 
based on the number of calls the mall is receiving from people asking how to 
get there. The mall has a Nordstrom, Robinsons-May, JC Penney, Mervyn's and 260 
shops, all of which are open. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local shopping centers that are at least partially open include the 
Panorama Mall in Panorama City, where some stores have reported a huge jump in 
sales; the Sherman Oaks Galleria, where about half the shops reopened last 
weekend, and the Promenade mall in Woodland Hills, which boasts the only 
operating Bullock's in the West Valley but is losing a Saks Fifth Avenue store 
that was damaged and will not reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shops at Woodland Hills' Topanga Plaza reopened on Friday. At Fallbrook 
Mall in Canoga Park, a Target and most of the smaller shops are back in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 But many open malls have anchor department stores that are still off-limits. 
That could prove a benefit for those centers with operating anchor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 In the parking lot at Topanga Plaza mall in Woodland Hills on Friday -- just a 
few hours after that mall partially reopened -- a man shouted frantically to 
another driver, "Is Nordstrom open? Any of the department stores?" Told they 
were all closed, he asked, "What about the other mall?" as he gestured in the 
direction of the Promenade a block away. When told the Bullock's there had 
reopened, he turned around and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the Promenade Bullock's, Bianca Wolter of Northridge shopped for her 
favorite brand of cosmetics. The Bullock's she usually patronizes, in the 
Northridge Fashion Center, collapsed in the earthquake and has been condemned. 
Bullock's says it wants to rebuild the Northridge store and is in discussions 
with the mall developer. 
</P>
<P>
 A table set up in front of the Promenade Bullock's advertised "Earthquake and 
Bridal Registry." Sales clerk Murray Rittner explained that customers can 
register for merchandise that their friends could buy to replace items lost in 
the earthquake, just as someone would register for wedding gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of the temporary shops set up in the mall to sell Bullock's housewares 
while the top floor of department store undergoes repairs, Marion and Frank 
Mendelson of Woodland Hills shopped for wine glasses to replace those broken in 
the quake. "I was serving wine in regular water glasses," said Frank. "It was 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Bethers, marketing director at Topanga Plaza, said she expects 
business to pick up when Nordstrom and housewares chain Crate & Barrel reopen 
in a few weeks, because both stores tend to be shopping destinations in 
themselves. The nearest Nordstrom stores at the Glendale Galleria and the 
Westside Pavillion are both open; the closest Crate & Barrel in Century City is 
also open. "We definitely will feel an effect because those stores are down," 
but when Nordstrom is up and running "we feel we'll do well," Bethers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Mueller, general manager at the Valencia Town Center in Santa Clarita, 
also expects business to gain steam. Because of severe traffic congestion due 
to a downed freeway interchange leading into Santa Clarita, many local 
residents who work in the San Fernando Valley might now shop at her mall 
instead of spending more time on the road going to shopping places in the 
Valley, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia mall has a Robinsons-May, JC Penney and Sears, all of which are 
open. Traffic was brisk last weekend as customers shopped for housewares, 
tools, televisions and mattresses, Mueller said. Another lure: The mall has 
started selling Metrolink tickets and "the service has just boomed" since the 
earthquake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the busiest places in the Valley during the past several days have been 
stores carrying housewares and home-repair products. 
</P>
<P>
 The Target store in Woodland Hills, which reopened two days after the quake, 
has been 30% busier than normal, said manager Joyce Atkinson. The chain has 
made supplying its Target stores that are open in the area a top priority so 
items remain plentiful, she said. "People are thanking us for being open." 
</P>
<P>
 At another Target store, in the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park -- where 
Mervyn's, Sears and the JC Penney Outlet store are closed -- Doris Dennis of 
Winnetka piled flashlights, paper plates and rubber containers into her 
shopping cart on Friday. "I'm going to eat off paper plates till I'm sure of 
the water supply," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away at Home Depot in Canoga Park, the parking lot was packed 
before noon Friday. Inside, shelves were well-stocked and customers shopped for 
everything from mirrors to pipes to cabinet latches. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Forrester of Chatsworth loaded three bags of dry stucco mix in his cart to 
fix earthquake cracks in his house and driveway. "I'm not too anxious to get 
started because I don't know if it's over yet," he said, referring to the 
frequent aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian Rennie of West Hills bought flashlights, batteries and gloves. "It's 
like closing the door after the horses have gone out," she laughed. But after 
groping around in the dark following the earthquake, she hopes to be prepared 
from now on. She even planned to buy fluorescent paint to make markers in her 
home that would be visible in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 But Home Depot store manager Bob Barnett said he has begun to see a shift in 
demand for products since the first days after the quake. "At first it was 
flashlights and tarps and emergency items to get back into homes," he said. 
"Now we're seeing things that are not as critical, but that need replacing, 
like brackets to hold shelves in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Stores that accept Red Cross and Salvation Army vouchers also reported big 
increases in business. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Kmart in North Hollywood, customer traffic has increased about 25% in 
recent days. Manager Mark Landis attributed the jump in part to the temporary 
closing of Kmarts in Northridge and San Fernando. But the vouchers are also 
generating so much business, he said, that three cash registers have been 
devoted just to voucher-paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest-selling items have been the obvious earthquake related items, 
Landis said -- bottled water, lanterns, flashlights and batteries. But he also 
recalled one customer who purchased a $500 necklace to cheer up his 
quake-rattled wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sav-On Drugs chain responded to the temporary closing of three 
earthquake-damaged stores in Sherman Oaks, Granada Hills and Woodland Hills by 
moving pharmacy files and automatically transferring phone calls to the nearest 
open Sav-Ons. Prescription drugs, bottled water and batteries have been the 
biggest-selling items, said a manager at the Studio City Sav-On, which is 
handling business from the closed Sherman Oaks store. "Cosmetic sales are also 
going up," he said. "Why, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 A few frayed nerves began to surface at retail outlets Friday. At the Circuit 
City store in Woodland Hills, a customer argued loudly with a manager over 
prices on a television and videocassette recorder he wanted to replace those 
lost in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At Topanga Plaza, Sunshine Beauty Supply assistant manager Audrey Veith glared 
at a pile of shampoo and cosmetics that workers had thrown into big plastic 
bags prior to removing some asbestos that had been dislodged during the 
earthquake. "It's really horrible," she said, noting that cans of hair spray 
had exploded and other products were ruined. Veith did manage to restock 
shelves with hair coloring kits. "I knew the ladies would want their hair dye," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for some customers, shopping was simply an opportunity to return to 
normal living. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig and Erin Johnson, who moved to Reseda from Texas seven months ago, 
visited Topanga Plaza on Friday to buy Dallas Cowboys T-shirts. Maclynn Larsen 
of La Crescenta and Marilyn Schuler of Ventura figured the mall would be a good 
place to meet for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 And at WaldenBooks, a prominent display inspired by the earthquake, featuring 
home repair and traffic guides, produced not one sale, said assistant manager 
Joyce McDougald. "People are just buying what they normally buy."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: AFTER QUAKE, FIRMS RUSH TO TELECOMMUTING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of the recent earthquake, Pacific Bell, Great Western Bank of 
Chatsworth and Cigna have signed long-term leases for space at the Valencia 
Corporate Telecommuting Center, a 30,000-square-foot telecommuting building 
that has been wired with fiber-optics and other voice and data networking 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's owner, Valencia-based Newhall Land & Farming Co., said several 
other major companies are considering signing leases to use the center, which 
is expected to be fully occupied soon.The center opened last December with one 
occupant, CareAmerica, the Chatsworth-based health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommuting center on Rye Canyon Road is part of the Valencia Industrial 
Center. It was designed for use by businesses during emergencies or as backup 
offices. The center accommodates various telecommunication needs, including 
video-conferencing and voice mail. Newhall Land is a real estate and 
agricultural concern that is developing the community of Valencia.

QUAKE EXPECTED TO AID SOME HOUSING MARKETS; REAL ESTATE: SOME BUYERS FROM THE 
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SEEK FIRMER GROUND IN THE ANTELOPE AND SANTA CLARITA 
VALLEYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deadly Jan. 17 earthquake that rocked the San Fernando Valley has sent 
some home buyers trucking to the Antelope Valley looking for firmer ground and, 
safer, more affordable housing, local builders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprising number of shoppers and buyers are a relief to local builders 
and realtors, who feared initially that damaged freeways leading to and from 
the Antelope Valley might discourage Los Angeles-area residents, whose homes 
were damaged by the 6.6-magnitude quake, from looking farther north for 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 50% of our traffic this weekend was from outside the Antelope Valley. 
The previous week, all of our traffic was local," said Scott Richter, president 
of Centex Homes, a new home builder based in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Centex salespeople in Palmdale sold five homes over the weekend, ranging from 
the low $100,000s to almost $200,000, Richter said. Three buyers were from the 
San Fernando Valley, including two people who were looking to move quickly into 
their new homes because their apartments were destroyed by the Northridge 
quake, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "This weekend was a whole lot better than our original expectations. If we 
could sell five homes every week, it would be great," Richter said. 
</P>
<P>
 His optimism was echoed by other Antelope Valley builders, who said that 
results from the two weekends after the quake suggest that things are not going 
to be as bad as originally feared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traffic was up significantly at our two tracts in east Palmdale compared to 
the previous weekend. The majority of our visitors were from the San Fernando 
Valley," said Ed Parker, vice president of sales and marketing for new home 
builder Epic Development in east Palmdale. "We sold three homes over the 
weekend: Two of the buyers were from the San Fernando Valley and the other from 
the Santa Clarita Valley. It's looking promising." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said the Epic homes sold over the weekend ranged from $129,995 to 
$154,995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Building Industry Assn. has urged its members to use the 
special FHA loan package for earthquake victims in their advertisements to lure 
potential buyers whose homes were damaged or destroyed in last month's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be advertising next week, telling people they can get an FHA loan with 
zero down payment for a new home if their homes were damaged or destroyed in 
the quake," said Richter. This special FHA loan package is good up to mortgages 
of $150,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While most Southlanders think of the Antelope Valley as a desert community 
isolated by earthquake-damaged freeways, local businessmen and politicians are 
touting the area as a place where the future has already arrived, thanks to 
last month's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 They are using the FHA loan package and newly expanded Metrolink as selling 
points to persuade earthquake victims to move to a "newer, more modern" 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake has also shaken loose a lot of things that had been on the back 
burner for a long time. These things are here now, and it's up to us to make 
potential home buyers and commuters aware that the future has arrived here," 
said Kimberly Maevers, director of governmental affairs for the Antelope Valley 
BIA. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Northridge quake shook more than just buildings and lives on Jan. 
17; it also has cut through government red tape. Plans are under way to widen 
and improve the Antelope Valley Freeway, which connects the Antelope Valley to 
the Los Angeles Basin. And the earthquake forced transportation officials to 
buy additional Metrolink cars that increased the number of commuters from the 
Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys more than tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Metrolink opened stations in Lancaster and Palmdale months ahead of 
schedule to save commuting time for Antelope Valley residents, part of an 
unprecedented effort to build a new transportation system for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Metrolink surprised hundreds of commuters by opening a Spartan but 
working station at Acton, on the Sierra Highway, south of Angeles Forest 
Highway. Metrolink officials said they are committed to serving the Antelope 
Valley for one year after the quake, but will maintain service thereafter if 
current ridership remains constant. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, the quake gave the housing market in both valleys an added boost 
over the long term, said local builders. They expressed confidence that housing 
starts in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys will grow even faster when the 
damaged freeways leading to and from those areas are repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the task for Maevers and other builders is to persuade San 
Fernando Valley residents that the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys are not 
only affordable places to live, but accessible too, despite the nightly 
television pictures of gridlock on the damaged Antelope Valley and Golden State 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question about it. You look at the newscasts every night and see how bad 
the traffic is going back to Santa Clarita and you know that's got to turn off 
some people. But when the repairs (to the freeways) are completed later this 
year, and with the transit system already in place, we think it's going to 
create a demand for housing in the Santa Clarita Valley," said Vance Meyer, 
executive vice president at Pardee Construction, based in Westwood.

 Pardee is working on two housing developments of 100 homes at the Northbridge 
development in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes under construction in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys are built 
according to newer and stricter earthquake safety codes. According to Meyer and 
other builders, the new homes fared very well in the earthquake. Builders are 
using the stricter building codes as selling points for the newly constructed 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter said San Fernando Valley residents visiting homes built by his company 
throughout the Antelope Valley are "asking a lot of questions" about the new 
building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at it from the standpoint of the buyer. He can buy a used home in the 
San Fernando Valley that was weakened by the quake, or he can buy a new home 
for about the same price or cheaper up here and know that it was built 
according to the latest codes," said Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Heflin, president of the Antelope Valley Board of Realtors, said that 
affordable new and used homes in the Antelope Valley already makes the area an 
attractive place for home buyers. The quake will benefit an already prosperous 
housing market in the Antelope Valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long term, it will make more people in the quake area look at the Antelope 
Valley as an option. Housing is already cheaper up here, and now we have 
Metrolink, which makes the commute into Los Angeles much more enjoyable. Those 
are two powerful incentives for people to move here," said Heflin.

EXHAUST SYSTEMS FIRM REVS UP PERFORMANCE; TRANSPORTATION: BORLA MAKES A NAME 
FOR ITSELF WITH CAR BUFFS. THEY SPEND BETWEEN $330 AND $3,000 FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

<P>
 Sell American high-performance auto mufflers to the Japanese on their home 
turf? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just a pipe dream for Borla Performance Industries. Last month the 
Oxnard company introduced its first product for the Japanese, an exhaust system 
for Corvettes, at a Tokyo auto show. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Borla, president of the 11-year-old company, said marketing his 
exhaust systems in Japan is a sound move. "We're riding the wave of American 
automobiles that are winding up in Japan. Every year I see more and more," as 
jeeps, sports cars and Harley-Davidson motorcycles are getting popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla's company, which Borla claims did $3 million in sales last year, has 
made a name for itself with a line of stainless-steel exhaust systems. The 
systems extract more power from an auto or truck's engine because they work 
more efficiently at getting the hot gasses out of the engine than conventional 
exhaust pipes, mufflers and catalytic converters. Most of his customers are 
baby boomers who remember the "muscle cars" of the '60s and are willing to 
spend more to squeeze extra power out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ford, General Motors or Chrysler produce a vehicle, the mufflers are 
designed to be as quiet as possible, Borla said. But about 10% of the owners 
are willing to put up with a bit more noise to improve acceleration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of spending $60 at Midas for a new muffler, these car buffs will spend 
from $330 to $3,000 for a Borla exhaust system. About 50 small companies in the 
U. S. make high-performance exhaust systems that they sell through specialty 
auto parts shops and the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla and its competition have thrived, independent experts say, because the 
exhaust system "is the cheapest, most effective way to get a rear-wheel 
horsepower increase in any kind of vehicle," said Dick Gazan, owner of Spectra 
Racing & Engine Development in San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sherman, a Huntington Beach racing-engine builder, said he uses less 
expensive exhaust systems that "perform as good or better" than the Borla 
models, but credits Borla with offering a quality product. "He makes everything 
out of stainless steel. Right away the price goes up," Sherman said. "But it 
should last about three times as long. You might say he has the Cadillac line 
of mufflers." 
</P>
<P>
 Borla Industries and its Japanese distributor, Startline Inc., hope to offer 
exhaust systems for the American vehicles most popular in Japan, including 
Camaros, Firebirds, Jeep Cherokees and Chevrolet Astro vans. "The Japanese are 
. . . heavily into the American auto scene so they want American parts on their 
cars and motorcycles," Borla said. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet Japan's emissions laws and other requirements, Borla recently became 
the first company based outside Japan to join the Japan Automotive Sports 
Muffler Assn. On his trip to Japan last month, Borla said he met with U. S. 
Ambassador Walter F. Mondale, who complimented him on working his way into the 
Japanese market. "He was very interested in how we became successful in Japan 
and interested in using the same formula to help other companies," Borla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla said that within five years, Europe and Asia, which now account for 10% 
of his company's sales, will increase to 25%. With the expansion into Japan, 
his goal is $600,000 in foreign sales in 1994. The company sells currently in 
Australia, England, Canada, Germany and New Zealand, the Arab Emirates, Brunei, 
Holland and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Borla's mufflers stand out? "You can take any of our mufflers and 
look right through it," he said. "Other mufflers have baffles -- or what I call 
'mazes and rat traps.' The hot exhaust gasses have to go all over the place," 
which diminishes engine power. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla has two patents and a third pending for a combination muffler and 
catalytic converter that enhances performance and reduces emissions. A big auto 
maker, Borla claims, has expressed interest in utilizing the technology under 
license for its exhaust systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a fast, agile set of wheels has always been a priority for Borla, a 
Romanian immigrant who was fascinated with autos as a teen-ager. In 1976 he 
started a New York company that made replacement exhaust systems for Rolls 
Royces and Bentleys. But his heart remained with sports cars and racing. "I got 
bored with the stodgy, old people who owned Rolls Royces. I wanted to get 
involved in performance vehicles," Borla said. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold the East Coast operation and moved across country, leased space and, 
starting with $7,000 and 10 new employees, opened his company in 1983. Over the 
years he got publicity by developing exhaust systems for the auto makers' 
"concept cars" exhibited at auto shows. He also advertises in about 30 auto 
magazines, including Car and Driver, Road & Track and Motor Trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla offers exhaust components for about 200 vehicles, from exotic Ferraris 
and Lamborghinis to more subdued Chevrolet Suburbans. When Borla started, he 
was in the highbrow Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche market. But he saw that the 
money was in volume, so he shifted the product line to the larger American 
market and started making exhaust equipment for Corvettes and full-size pickup 
trucks. Today his list prices range from $332 for a Chrysler Eagle Talon 
exhaust system to $3,048 for a Lamborghini Diablo. 
</P>
<P>
 "European cars have gotten so expensive. You can go out and buy a $20,000 
American car and blow away an $80,000 Mercedes," said Borla, who drives a 1993 
Ford Mustang Cobra equipped, naturally, with Borla mufflers. By the time he's 
through tweaking and adding a supercharger, he figures he'll have about 450 
horsepower under the hood. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall the company, which now has 50 workers, moved to a five-acre site 
that will include an emissions lab, an 1/8-mile drag strip, a slalom course and 
a skid pad to test cars fitted with Borla mufflers  
</P>
<P>
 To diversify, the company plans to eventually sell a turbocharging system for 
Harley Davidsons in Japan. But Borla's growth has been fueled by aggressive 
marketing. Sales of the company's mufflers and exhaust systems, which he said 
are available as dealer-installed options at Ford dealers nationwide this year, 
could produce another $800,000 in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We equipped some Ford pickup trucks which needed more power for towing. Going 
up a grade the trucks, towing a 15,000 pound load, could only go about 55 
m.p.h. With the exhaust system they can go 65 to 68 m.p.h.," Borla said. His 
company also has a deal to supply replacement exhaust systems for the United 
Parcel Service's local fleet of delivery trucks.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: BIRD TRAVEL FIRM LOSES RIGHT TO SELL TICKETS FOR 3 
AIRLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bird Enterprises, the high-flying concern that at one time claimed to be 
Ventura County's largest independently owned travel firm, has been stripped of 
its right to sell tickets for the nation's three largest airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the wake of a discount ticketing dispute with American, United and 
Delta airlines, President Maggie Bird apparently has closed the company's three 
travel agencies in the county. The Travel Mart in Port Hueneme, Esplanade World 
Travel in Oxnard and Travel World in Ventura filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
petition last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute stemmed from the airlines' contention that the Bird agencies were 
granting deep, unauthorized discounts to non-government employees. The 
reductions, normally reserved for federal workers, can cut fares by as much as 
50%, an industry source said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the airlines, American, lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
revenue because of Bird's alleged practice, according to Los Angeles law firm 
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which was representing American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Without ruling on the discounting dispute, Ventura County Superior Court Judge 
Edwin M. Osborne issued a summary judgment in December granting the carriers 
the right to terminate their relationship with the Bird agencies. Bird "has no 
legal authority" to issue tickets for any of the three carriers, Osborne ruled 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling derailed cross-complaints filed by Maggie Bird, whose firms' 
bookings exceeded $5 million as recently as 1992. Bird claimed her agencies 
couldn't be terminated "without a showing of good cause." 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing is far from resolved," Bird declared. "We're in negotiation. 
There's a possibility that we may appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Bird also said she is talking to prospective buyers of her firm. She said she 
is now based in Los Angeles, but declined to give details. "We're definitely 
still in business." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the phone lines at the Bird offices in Port Hueneme and Ventura were 
no longer in service. And in Oxnard, an official of another travel firm said 
his company is moving into the Bird agency's former space but has no connection 
with Bird Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Edelman, the Gibson, Dunn attorney who represented American in the 
dispute, said he is not sure whether American Airlines will seek to recover 
$200,000 in revenue it claims to have lost due to discounts issued by Bird 
Enterprises. He pointed out that Bird is still protected by its bankruptcy 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge's ruling is extremely important to American and the airline 
industry in general," Edelman said. "It means government fares are only for 
government employees. . . . Travel agencies are not allowed to sell these fares 
on terms not authorized by the airlines."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: 2 SIMI FIRMS RUSH TO KEEP BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Simi Valley businesses have acted quickly to maintain their operations 
without interruption, despite severe earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 One firm, First Interstate Bank, chartered a fleet of buses to carry more than 
500 employees of the bank's credit card center to Downtown Los Angeles 
daily.The three-story building that formerly housed the center has been closed 
indefinitely, 
</P>
<P>
 "It was critical that the operation continue without interruption," said First 
Interstate spokesman Rich Wyler. "All customer service, posting and billing for 
our statewide Visa and MasterCard programs was done from that building." 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate, California's third-largest bank, rented five buses to carry 
two shifts of workers back and forth to Los Angeles daily. By the end of this 
week, the bank expects to have temporarily relocated all 550 employees who 
worked in the Simi Valley building. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyler said bank officials will wait for engineering reports before scheduling 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to structural damage, the 180,000-square-foot facility suffered 
extensive water damage from broken lines, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another company, Advanced Compression Technology Inc., a producer of 
integrated communications systems, moved all 55 of its employees and all its 
equipment and supplies to Camarillo within three days of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's headquarters building on Cochran Street in Simi Valley was made 
uninhabitable, reported spokeswoman Marilyn F. Marme. "The walls were tilted 
outward, the ceiling was down and there was water throughout the plant," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marme said Advanced has already started shipping products from its new 
location on Flynn Street in Camarillo.

<P>
 Home sales in Ventura County in 1993 showed the strongest year-to-year 
performance of any Southern California county, according to TRW REDI Property 
Data. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 8,845 new and used residences changed hands in the county last 
year, 5% more than in 1992, the service reports. Orange County, the only other 
county in the region to register an improvement, showed a 1% gain. 
</P>
<P>
 In single-family resales, the largest part of the market, Ventura County had 
6,219 sales last year, 8% more than the previous year, according to Dataquick 
Information Systems. Condominium resales in the county last year totaled 1,403, 
a 2% decline.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: FOOTHILL GROUP'S PROFITS FOR 4TH QUARTER SURGE 34% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Foothill Group, a financial services firm with headquarters in Agoura 
Hills and Los Angeles, said its fourth-quarter profit surged 34% to $3.53 
million, from $2.64 million a year earlier.The profit came despite a loss of 
$1.24 million from its thrift subsidiary, which Foothill spun off to its 
shareholders in December. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, the Foothill Group's profit climbed 55% to $18.7 million, 
from $12.1 million for 1992. Foothill attributed the better results to 
improvements in interest margins, growth of its asset-based loan portfolio and 
robust money management activities. Foothill said that at the end of 1993, it 
had total assets owned or under management of more than $1.1 billion.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; BOWL OFFERS A BREAK FOR QUAKE VICTIMS; 
RECREATION: FOR MANY AT RELIEF CENTERS, THE NFL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME PROVIDED A 
RESPITE FROM THEIR TRYING SITUATIONS. TV SETS ARE DONATED TO 29 SHELTERS FOR 
THE EVENT.

 For about three hours Sunday, dozens of victims of the Northridge earthquake 
put aside their worries about shattered homes, lost jobs and anxious relatives 
as they kicked back and enjoyed a less frightening form of violence: Super Bowl 
XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting in a FEMA line all week," said a drawn-looking Jeff Mandel, 
40, as he sat intently watching the game from his cot at a Red Cross shelter in 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot easier," said Mandel, whose North Hills apartment was condemned 
after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At 29 shelters throughout the city, people made homeless by the quake cheered 
the Buffalo Bills or the Dallas Cowboys, happy to see somebody other than 
themselves and their families get knocked around for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims watched the sports extravaganza on color TVs donated by Circuit 
City and the A. C. Green Foundation for Youth, set up by the former Lakers 
basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV delivery came just in time for J. B. Cash, 35, who has lived in the 
Canoga Park High School gymnasium since his Northridge apartment was wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That picture tube is messed up," he said, pointing to a dilapidated school TV 
set on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the distractions of a small army of news photographers taking shots 
from every conceivable angle, Cash seemed content to recline on a blue army cot 
and root for the Bills, who lost their fourth consecutive Super Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated on the floor before him were brothers Frank and David Mory, ages 13 and 
10, who, naturally, cheered for opposite sides. David was in Super Bowl heaven, 
carefully selecting potato chips from three different bags and occasionally 
digging into a bag of cheese puffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Mason Park in Chatsworth, Fernando Delao of Chatsworth held his 3-year-old 
son, Eric, and related how the game was a welcome distraction from the 
Northridge quake and another temblor he survived, the 1986 Mexico City quake, 
which killed 4,700 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I watch the game I forget about the earthquake and how I felt I would 
lose my life at that moment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for others, the Northridge earthquake and the massive destruction it 
caused took the exuberance out of the championship football game. Unlike their 
counterparts watching from their own homes, they enjoyed no booze, no cheering, 
no high fives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game keeps you busy from thinking about everything that's happened, but 
then you look around you and it all comes back," said Giovanni Pacheco, a 
16-year-old North Hills resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco spent last week at a shelter in Granada Hills, but his family has 
since moved back into their home. But Pacheco returned to the shelter to watch 
the game with a newfound friend, Inez Becker, with whom he spent much of the 
game smooching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buffalo is going down," said Pacheco, between kisses with Becker, who was too 
absorbed to talk. "Dallas is going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Clarence Nelson and his friend, Keith Louis, enjoyed themselves 
almost as much as they would have if they hadn't been knocked out of their 
Reseda apartments. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Budweiser truck got a flat on the way over here," joked Nelson, 42, who 
saw the game inside a Red Cross tent in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we need a case of beer," cracked Louis.

SCIENCE CALENDAR: QUAKE CLEANUP POSES LUNG HAZARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fallout from the Jan. 17 earthquake poses special hazards to individuals 
with respiratory problems, according to the American Lung Assn. Stress can 
trigger asthma attacks, particularly in children, and the dust particles in the 
air can aggravate respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and volunteers involved in cleanup may be exposed to ashes, dust and 
other particulates. The group suggests the following guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 * Individuals with lung or heart problems should avoid cleaning up where dust 
or soot is evident. 
</P>
<P>
 * When cleaning a dusty or sooty area, thoroughly wet the area before clean-up 
and wear a dust mask. 
</P>
<P>
 * If asbestos or other hazardous materials are present, do not attempt to 
clean the area. Only licensed individuals with training in asbestos removal 
should be involved. The Lung Assn. can provide a list of qualified asbestos 
contractors and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also developed programs to help people protect their lungs during the 
post-quake period. The group is providing referrals for respiratory care items 
and has a limited amount of funding to replace equipment for patients whose 
equipment was destroyed in the quake. Medical referrals are required for the 
program.

 Was California's Old Faithful trying to warn us? 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 quake didn't exactly come as a surprise to Olga Kolbeck, even 
though she lives in northern California. That's because Kolbeck can see a 
geyser out her window -- California's version of Old Faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Dec. 12, the geyser changed its pattern," said Kolbeck, a retired 
schoolteacher in the town of Calistoga. "Normally it erupts about every 40 
minutes. But since then, the eruptions have been 1 1/2 hours to 1 3/4 hours 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Kolbeck says the geyser also slowed down just before the Loma Prieta (1989), 
Morgan Hill (1984) and Oroville (1975) shakers, a finding confirmed by 
geologists from the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. The scientists 
feel there may have been a link in those cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kolbeck isn't completely sure the geyser was signaling the 6.6 jolt, 
inasmuch as the epicenter was more than 500 miles to the south. "We've also 
been having a lot of 3.0 quakes up here," she pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 One theory is that seismic movement may alter cracks deep in the volcanic 
formation that sits beneath the geyser, trapping the water that normally 
erupts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish," Kolbeck said, "I could see down in there." 
</P>

 All-SigAlert radio: Like Old Faithful, KNX-AM radio has changed its pattern. 
But the all-news station's switch came after the quake. KNX, which previously 
issued traffic reports every 10 minutes during its newscasts, has temporarily 
stepped up the pace to every six minutes. 
</P>

 Talk about being unprepared for a quake: The Northridge shaker had Chris 
Christopherson thinking of the 6.3 Long Beach quake of 1933, which struck just 
before 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopherson, a longtime resident of that city, said "there were a lot of 
cathouses along Anaheim Boulevard and the walls of these places just fell away. 
A lot of guys were embarrassed to be found with naked girls there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marching to Georgia: Diane Fradin of West L.A. noticed that one of the books 
that fell onto her dining room chair during the quake was "Finding Your Best 
Place to Live in America," by Dr. Thomas F. Bowman.  
</P>
<P>
 A timely subject, she figured. "On Feb. 14," she adds, "the movers are coming 
to pick up my stuff and I'm returning to Atlanta." 
</P>

 The surest Super Bowl bet of all: After crashing a championship fight in Las 
Vegas and a Raiders football game in the Coliseum, paraglider James Miller 
declared a few weeks ago: "Just wait until the Super Bowl." Well, Tom LaBonge 
wasn't surprised when Miller failed to interrupt the game Sunday. "The Georgia 
Dome," LaBonge pointed out, "is an indoor stadium." miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 Historian Bruce Henstell, writing in Westways, notes that Feb. 21, 1887, was a 
milestone in L.A. history. That's the day Charity Street was re-christened 
Grand Avenue because Downtown residents didn't like the idea they were "living 
on Charity."

AL MARTINEZ: DOVE FEATHERS IN THE DUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suppose you gave a peace movement and nobody came? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the state we're in now that the Cold War is over and hardly anyone is 
worried about nuclear missiles falling from the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, there's that situation in Bosnia where children are dying in the 
snow, but since that doesn't threaten us directly we can accept a little, you 
know, hell-raising here and there. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone on this side of the old Iron Curtain cheered when the Berlin Wall 
came down and the Soviet Union fell apart. The threat of annihilation was 
suddenly as cold as yesterday's soup. But peace has its dark side, too. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, more than 100,000 defense and aerospace workers in L.A. County 
have lost their jobs because we don't need all those guns and fighter jets and 
missiles anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 And Yakov Smirnoff, the Russian immigrant who used to make a living poking fun 
at Communism, has had to retool his shtick to embrace in-law jokes. Is there 
anything sadder? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not saying peace is hell, but it comes close. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Jerry Rubin is looking for work. I know I said he was a publicity hound 
and I'd never mention his name again, but this is different. The guy has only 
$2 to his name and the wolf is at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember Rubin. He's our most visible peace activist. As director of 
L.A.'s Alliance for Survival, he was to international crisis what seismologist 
Lucy Jones is to earth tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever hawks rattled sabers, Rubin was on the tube waving dove feathers, and 
we cheered his efforts. But nobody's cheering anymore, and the dove feathers 
are lying useless in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The peace movement has been falling apart for about two years now, ever since 
the Soviet Union died, but it wasn't until last New Year's Eve that Rubin 
realized he had to find work. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 40 people showed up at the Alliance for Survival's annual peace party. In 
the past, as many as 300 came, paying $20 at the door for an evening of food 
and entertainment. It was the alliance's biggest fund-raiser of the year, and 
it flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good time and sang 'Auld Lang Syne,' but my heart was broken," Rubin 
said the other day. "No one came. It was over." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact was more than psychological. As full-time director of the alliance, 
Rubin took half of its profits from various events to support himself. His 
share amounted to about $6,000 a year; not enough to maintain a lifestyle of 
the rich and famous but, with a working wife, an adequate amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Year's Eve flop proved that no one is interested in peace movements 
anymore. But that was just one indication. Rubin has seen attendance at most 
alliance functions drop by 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's $2 left in my bank account," he said in a tone usually reserved for 
those announcing the horrors of war rather than the horrors of peace. "I had to 
sell bumper stickers on the beach to pay the phone bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Every peace group is suffering, Rubin says. "It's not just us. Staff members 
are being laid off, and there are no retirement benefits. The movement just 
isn't popular anymore. I've got to find a real job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's not going to be easy for a guy who's 50 and graying. Rubin has become a 
metaphor for the peace movement itself, growing older with limited options. 
</P>
<P>
 No one's going to care that he's worked 14 years on behalf of peace. Where do 
you put on a resume that you've gone to jail five times and fasted 15 times to 
help make everyone aware of the dangers of war? How do you measure the impact 
of marches and banners and buttons and bumper stickers? You don't get the Nobel 
Prize for being a little guy out there in a corner of the world waving dove 
feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at me," Rubin said disconsolately. "I'm a 50-year-old high school 
dropout with no skills. Well, actually, a high school kick-out. I don't type, I 
can't drive and I don't hear too well. Who's going to hire me?" 
</P>
<P>
 He's got a point. When I asked what kind of a job he was looking for, he 
wasn't even sure of that. He applied at some department stores, but was turned 
down. He'd rather not sell shoes anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to consult or maybe have his own talk show, but both possibilities 
seem remote. Whatever happens, he's going to stay with the alliance, probably 
on a weekend basis, and try to turn it toward the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace isn't a fad," he said. "It's a lifetime commitment. But I've got to 
eat." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure how you thank someone who once marched with crowds and now walks 
alone. I'm not sure how you say "you mattered." But if it's any consolation, 
Jerry Rubin, you did matter. Too bad that isn't enough to pay the rent.

THEY ONLY HELP THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES; U.S. AID, YES, BUT THE STATE MUST BE 
WILLING TO TAX ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington continues to respond efficiently to the mounting challenges created 
by the Northridge earthquake. But the aid being delivered by the federal 
government is only the beginning for Southern California: Much more will be 
needed to rebuild a region that is crucial to the entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Shalala, President Clinton's health and human services secretary, is the 
latest Cabinet member to personally inspect the damage and announce federal 
assistance. She will make available $28 million more to help repair hospitals 
and government medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown is expected to come to Los Angeles this 
week to address the long-term recovery of businesses. That visit, too, is most 
welcome, for an economic recovery is critical to restoring jobs, goods, 
services and a sense of order. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is expected to seek at least $8.6 billion in aid -- 
and that figure might increase as damage estimates grow. Congress will soon 
take up a supplemental appropriation to help Los Angeles. To help speed that 
legislation into law, Gov. Pete Wilson should put more state money on the table 
in Sacramento. His initial request for 100% federal financing is unrealistic. 
He and the Legislature must be prepared to consider a temporary tax hike to 
help pay for rebuilding. If federal purse strings are to loosen again, 
Washington must see Californians as willing to do their part. 
</P>
<P>
 The need is enormous. Nearly 216,000 people applied for federal assistance, 
according to Richard Andrews, director of the California Office of Emergency 
Services, and thousands more are expected to apply before the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency folds up its disaster relief centers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of victims already have received government checks and vouchers to 
pay for temporary housing and other basic necessities and repairs. Another 
group that desperately needs help is the many individuals and families who were 
homeless before the earthquake; currently, they don't qualify for emergency 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 112,000 people had applied for emergency food stamps by Saturday. 
Sadly -- but predictably -- their ranks included more than a few fraudulent 
applicants. At the urging of the County Board of Supervisors, federal and 
county officials put in new safeguards to prevent abuse, including a computer 
system to track duplicate applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have lost no time in making arrests for aid-related fraud. 
Inspectors from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the food 
stamp program, and local police officers have arrested five people on charges 
of illegally buying food stamps from cash-hungry applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake, which has generated both heroism and greed, has 
proved to be no exception to the notion that tragedy brings out the best and 
worst in people. The 6.6-point temblor killed our neighbors, destroyed our 
homes, damaged our businesses and karate-chopped some freeways, and its 
seemingly endless aftershocks have frayed our nerves. But it did not shatter 
our resolve, and the surest way to prove that to the rest of the country is for 
Sacramento to rapidly ante up the tax money needed for rebuilding.

HOSOKAWA -- STILL STANDING; JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER EMERGES FROM A BRUTAL 
POLITICAL BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is still on course in his campaign to lead 
Japan into a new political era. His victory in securing significant political 
reform signals a changing Japan that may at long last put consumer interests 
ahead of Japan Inc. Should that shift occur, Tokyo will find it a popular and 
pragmatic move, and not just in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than five years of seemingly endless debate over political reform, 
Parliament finally passed a mild reform package last Saturday. It is short of 
the sweeping initiative Hosokawa sought at first, but it overhauls Japan's 
electoral system and puts some limits on political donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's reformist efforts extend well beyond these changes. His coalition 
government virtually has upended the traditional style of Japanese politics, 
back-room dealings and party alliances. Voters are being listened to, and the 
public prosecutor's office is aggressively rooting out corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Having achieved his first priority, political reform, Hosokawa now turns to 
economic problems at home and to stalemated U.S.-Japan trade talks. This week 
he is expected to unveil a long-delayed package of tax cuts and government 
spending, a major effort to stimulate the ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Will reformist Hosokawa make any difference in U.S.-Japan trade negotiations? 
In public, he has taken a less than conciliatory tone on the basic points of 
disagreement. But during his few months in office Japan has agreed to open its 
rice market to imports and to increase foreign access to public work projects. 
Both will benefit U.S. businesses. The next step is to push Japan's bureaucrats 
to reduce the $50-billion trade imbalance with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when Hosokawa arrives for his Feb. 11 meeting with President Clinton he 
must be bearing more than the traditional "gifts" of a tax cut and vague trade 
promises. That was pro forma for old Japan. His new Japan must deliver 
substantive commitments on trade.

EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As Mike Davis so correctly points out ("The Charade of Preparedness," 
Opinion, Jan. 23), planning for an earthquake or any other natural or man-made 
hazard has been too much under the control of developers, dependent and 
friendly politicians and the corporate bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, politicians allow self-regulation and compliance while reassuring 
the public that inspections and building codes will protect us from financial 
and personal harm. Buildings are allowed in areas that should never be built 
upon. Developers are allowed to do their own testing and write their own 
reports. The courts and the Legislature restrict and delay the ability of 
citizens to recover losses caused by poor planning and building decisions, 
fraud, and negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 More stringent building codes and penalties would be a step in the right 
direction, but the reality is that the financial and emotional investment we 
make in our homes and businesses is still dependent upon the will and backbone 
of people who seem to have other priorities.

 * My family moved to Northridge in 1963 and most of us still live there. Now 
that the immediate danger is over, we found that we all had a good cry from the 
loss of some of our favorite places and things that over the years we grew to 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 But I think that the true story of the Northridge earthquake is still to come. 
It was the massive response by our city government to the crises. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, we were impressed with the Department of Water and Power, the 
Gas Co., Caltrans, and the Building and Safety Department along with the troops 
of police, fire, and clean-up crews that are helping our area recover. My 
family would like to thank all of those people who worked so hard for us. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will soon tell us about many things that failed, from shoddy 
construction to poor design, but it may yet serve as the model of a city's 
rapid, efficient and coordinated response to an urban earthquake.

 * Yes, we want safe freeways -- but they aren't free, and they've never been 
partially safe, even without earthquakes. James Moore II ("Fix the Freeways 
Before Funding Trains," Commentary, Jan. 25) brings us the engineer's point of 
view about where to put our priorities and funding, but leaves out the human 
factor. Driving in Los Angeles is a negative, stressful and anti-social 
activity. It will only get worse in the future unless our leaders " . . . focus 
public resources for the greatest benefit of the greatest number of people" as 
Moore suggests, and dedicate funding to public mass transit systems (light 
rail, subways, electric buses.) 
</P>
<P>
 As the British Economist opinion (same page) says, we're at our best when we 
look forward. Public transportation, not private cars, is the best future for 
Los Angeles.

POLICING WATCH; STAYING POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officer Mona Ruiz of the Santa Ana Police Department has survived the gunfire, 
said no to drugs and faced down the scorn from two worlds. Her story, recently 
reported in The Times, is testimony to the sustaining power of a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former gang member pressured as a teen-ager to conform, she has had to 
will herself forward to a constructive life. Her presence on the department's 
gang unit, after leaving that world behind, gives special meaning to the idea 
of community policing.  
</P>
<P>
 The 380-member department has only 15 women officers, and of these only three 
are Latinas. Those numbers alone, unfortunately, are not surprising; the ratios 
are not dissimilar to those of many other police departments in the region. But 
more than the numbers it was the odds in life that were stacked against Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
 This 5-foot-3 mother of three went to work for the Police Department as a 
clerk when she was in high school. She had to deal with both suspicion from 
those she left behind and hostility from some on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory C. Brown, a criminal justice professor at Chapman University, himself 
an escapee from the world of gangs in Watts, says Ruiz is remarkable for having 
stayed; in moving up she did not also move out, to some other place. Isn't such 
dedication to one's roots what community-building is all about? 
</P>
<P>
 By bridging battle-scarred divides, by resolving that things would be 
different for herself and her children, Ruiz has become a role model for our 
time -- both an officer and a gentlewoman.

GO NATIONAL, OR GO BROKE; WHY GENUINE DISASTER INSURANCE CAN'T BE A 
CALIFORNIA-ONLY DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A number of legislators are eager to revive the short-lived California 
Residential Earthquake Recovery Fund, an insurance pool that was supposed to 
provide up to $15,000 in quake loss coverage to every homeowner, but which had 
to be liquidated as it teetered toward insolvency. The impulse to again offer 
some form of protection against major loss is understandable.But a limited, 
localized response falls well short of what's needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more preferable is an insurance program that would be both affordable and 
truly broad-based. Probably the best approach is through a national disaster 
insurance program. Legislation to that end has been drafted. Congress should 
move quickly to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Disaster Protection Act would offer incentives to states to adopt 
building codes to make new construction less vulnerable to earthquakes, 
hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters. It would give insurance 
companies incentives to offer coverage against quakes and other perils not 
usually included in basic homeowner policies. And it would create a federal 
reinsurance fund, to be financed by the insurance industry, to reduce the risks 
of insurance company insolvencies because of exceptionally large claims in 
natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Spreading the risk is essential to keeping premiums affordable. On Jan. 17 no 
more than 25% of California homeowners carried earthquake insurance, an 
indication either of a staggering degree of optimism or -- much more likely -- 
a pervasive feeling that high premium costs and large deductibles had simply 
put earthquake insurance out of reach. But natural disasters will ever be with 
us. There are sound and affordable ways to mitigate their economic 
consequences. A national program to protect against natural disasters seems 
clearly to be an idea whose time has come.

REGULATING DAY LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "A Case of Overkill" (Commentary, Jan. 25), regarding the county's pending 
employment solicitation ordinance, totally misrepresented both the issue and 
the Ladera Heights community. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladera Heights is a successfully integrated, upper-middle-class neighborhood 
situated south of Baldwin Hills, north of Inglewood, and east of Culver City. 
It is a community composed of professional people of all races and ethnic 
backgrounds who live together in harmony, and the extraordinarily low crime 
rate is due largely to neighbor looking after neighbor. The Ladera Heights 
Civic Assn. is the voice and advocate of the 3,500 families living here. 
</P>
<P>
 The day laborers do not reside in Ladera Heights -- they are trucked in, 
dropped off, and spend the day loitering about when they are not hired. The 
contractors who hire the day laborers do not reside in Ladera Heights, nor is 
their work in Ladera Heights. The contractors come here for one reason . . . 
this is the only Home Base store for miles around, and someone is providing an 
ample supply of day laborers.  
</P>
<P>
 As each day passes, large numbers of day laborers congregate around people's 
homes or small businesses waiting to be picked up. They drink, gamble, defecate 
in the bushes, fight among themselves, and make lewd remarks to passers-by. 
They threaten Ladera residents and once attacked the Home Base manager who no 
longer allows them on Home Base property. A Ladera church complained to the 
association that the day laborers obstruct its sidewalks and cause disturbances 
during funerals and other church functions. 
</P>
<P>
 The association tried the mediation services offered by the county but so far 
they have been a waste of time. It conducted an investigation of the measures 
adopted by several other cities, from the establishment of employment centers 
to the implementation of ordinances such as the one now proposed. The single 
most effective remedy to the problems caused by the day laborers in residential 
areas was the passing of these ordinances.  
</P>
<P>
 The county ordinance would be in effect only within 500 feet of a residential 
area, school, park, or church. It is a reasonable measure, yet the advocates 
oppose it, proposing instead that they establish, staff and run employment 
centers. Cannot the ordinance go into effect and the advocates establish 
employment centers in non-residential areas?  
</P>
<P>
 The advocates have a nasty habit of crying "Racism!" whenever they cannot 
prevail, but this time their charge is ludicrous, especially their claim of 
rising racial tensions in Ladera Heights. There is no racial tension, and this 
is not a racial issue. This is an issue of a community having its safety, 
property and peace violated, and it has a right, even an obligation, to seek 
protection for its residents.

 * I was angered to read that with unemployment rates in Southern California 
being one of the highest nationally, Supervisor Yvonne Burke seeks to pass 
legislation to outlaw casual labor solicitation. The proposed "seek a job, go 
to jail" ordinance is but another example of the criminalization of poverty by 
elected officials for political gain. Casual labor has historically been an 
entry point into the labor force for the unskilled and a last resort for 
workers displaced from other industries. Deprived of their right to seek an 
honest day's pay, these day laborers may turn to drug sales, robbery or other 
crimes to support their families.  
</P>
<P>
 An entire community of workers, businesses and taxpayers would benefit by 
allowing these day laborers to have a hiring hall rather than an arrest record.

INFLATION RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am appalled by the use of the word only to describe the 2.7% rate of 
inflation for 1993 (Jan. 14).  
</P>
<P>
 The only acceptable rate of inflation is zero! To put this into perspective, 
think of paying 10.95% sales tax for everything you buy in Los Angeles 
County.Can you imagine the uproar which would be created if a bureaucrat asked 
the voters to approve such a level? Yet the government can get away with a 
concealed insidious tax like this and newspapers are helping brainwash the 
public that it is reasonable and acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 This is also a tax on every dollar of savings put aside for the future. At 
this rate of inflation, every dollar saved will be worth 50 cents in 26.7 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 I beg of you not to assist the government in convincing us that anything over 
zero inflation is acceptable. This is nothing more than a hidden tax piled on 
top of our already horrendous load of taxes.

COLUMN LEFT/ HARRY BERNSTEIN: OLD GUARD WANTS TO SMITE THE REFORMER; TEAMSTERS' 
RON CAREY IS TARGETED BY LOW-LEVEL OFFICIALS RESENTFUL OF HIS CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN, Harry Bernstein was for many years The Times' labor writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Carey is under intense attack these days by those he battled two years ago 
to become president of the giant Teamsters Union. Carey helped clean out the 
mobsters, and is still battling old-guard leaders who tolerated mob dominance 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-supervised election that Carey won was held after the union's 
former leaders agreed to it to avoid prosecution on racketeering charges.  
</P>
<P>
 The union was crime-ridden for years. Its top officers supported anti-union 
presidential candidates Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush. They were 
accused of making sweetheart deals with some companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Carey, the progressive reformist, is in trouble. The union is spending 
more on everything from new organizing drives and higher strike benefits than 
it receives in dues from its 1.4 million members. One of Carey's foes estimates 
that nearly 70% of the entrenched, lower-level officers of the union oppose 
him, despite his clear victory when all members voted in the union's first-ever 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey has not been good news for anti-worker management, either. He and his 
allies have started waging highly visible, readily justified fights against 
reactionary companies. He backs strikes by personally joining picket lines and 
boldly proposed a dues increase -- first in a decade -- to keep paying $200 
weekly strike benefits (raised from $50) and push more reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey and his allies have initiated major, badly needed organizing campaigns 
to make up for the loss in recent years of nearly 500,000 members -- losses 
that came largely because of intense anti-union campaigns by management and the 
creation of thousands of small, non-union trucking companies made possible by 
trucking industry deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The reformists not only made a 180-degree turn in the union's national-level 
political stance by backing moderately liberal Democrat Bill Clinton, but they 
also are intensifying their fight for universal health care, labor-law reform 
and a broad, liberal legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most vicious attacks on Carey are coming from men like Alfonso 
D'Arco, a one-time member of the Luchese crime family who quit the mob and 
began talking to law-enforcement. D'Arco claimed that Carey himself had links 
to the underworld -- an unsubstantiated accusation that Carey calls "smut." 
</P>
<P>
 More important to his reputation is support from Michael H. Holland, a former 
general counsel of the United Mine Workers of America who was named by a tough 
federal judge to supervise the first referendum in the union's 89-year history 
-- one member, one vote. All past presidents were elected at tightly controlled 
conventions.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is simply no believable evidence that Carey is anything but the 
upstanding, honest trade unionist that I have found him to be," Holland told 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is still being supervised by a court-appointed independent review 
board that includes former FBI Director William H. Webster and a former federal 
judge, Frederick B. Lacey. The board itself says it has been given no credible 
evidence to support the claim that Carey is linked to the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
 Several long-time Teamsters officers say they don't believe that Carey was 
linked to gangsters. But he is facing different attacks from them and other 
lower-level Teamsters officers who tolerated mob leadership even though they 
themselves were clean and usually effective unionists at local and regional 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 They complain that Carey isn't an effective leader, appoints "outsiders" who 
have had no experience with their union to top posts and that he is now 
jeopardizing the union's future by calling for a nationwide membership 
referendum to boost union dues without first holding a convention. The 
convention could also pass resolutions undercutting him by taking away much of 
his authority as president. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey's plan to let all members vote on the increase is a daring risk -- like 
holding a nationwide referendum on whether voters want a tax increase. If the 
dues hike is defeated, the strike fund would be out of money by next June and 
the union's general treasury would run dry next year. The proposal is being 
denounced by Carey's foes, putting them in open rebellion against him. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a sad chapter for the union movement if the Teamsters' first-ever 
reformist president -- the first elected by a majority vote among all members 
instead of by delegates to those carefully managed union conventions that 
allowed mob domination for so many years -- is rejected.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE U.S./JAPAN RELATIONSHIP; PROMISES OF 'CHANGE' RING HOLLOW; 
ONE YEAR LATER, THERE'S BEEN LITTLE PROGRESS ON LOWERING THE TRADE GAP AND 
BREAKING DOWN IMPORT BARRIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLEN S. FUKUSHIMA, Glen S. Fukushima, an American business executive based 
in Tokyo, is vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. From 
1985 to 1990, he directed Japanese affairs at the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The relationship between the United States and Japan is in serious disrepair. 
Japan's huge account surplus, low level of manufactured imports, minuscule 
inward foreign direct investment and barriers to foreign products and services 
persist unabated. Why has there been so little progress despite the 
inauguration last year in both nations of governments espousing "change"? The 
answer is inattention, complacency and missed opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Inattention to the relationship has been abetted by a sense of complacency in 
both countries. In the United States, this complacency has three sources. 
</P>
<P>
 First, exaggerated media accounts have misled Americans into believing that 
"the Japanese sun has set." Although the current recession has lasted longer 
than expected, the fundamental strengths of the Japanese economy remain intact. 
Within 12 to 18 months, the cost-cutting, rationalization and restructuring to 
squeeze out the excesses of the "bubble economy" of the late 1980s and early 
'90s will have had their effect, and Japan will again emerge as a formidable 
competitor. Americans should substitute wishful thinking with objective and 
realistic analyses of long-term Japanese global economic strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Second is the mistaken notion that the "reforms" advocated by Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa -- and passed by the Diet on Saturday after being rejected by 
the Upper House on Jan. 21 -- would benefit not only Japan but also its trading 
partners, in particular the United States. This fallacy was premised on the 
assumption that the realignment of political parties in Japan would 
automatically lead to a more open, transparent, consumer-oriented society.  
</P>
<P>
 Third, the Clinton Administration appears to believe that asymmetries in the 
economic relationship can be remedied simply by asking Japan to commit to 
"results" -- whether in its current-account surplus, aggregate level of 
manufactured imports or sector-specific imports. There is an evident lack of 
appreciation of the profound complexities and difficulties facing foreign firms 
attempting to export to or invest in Japan and the attention, expertise and 
resources necessary on the part of the U.S. government and corporations to 
penetrate the multilayered and deeply rooted barriers posed by the Japanese 
market. The Administration also lacks an understanding of where, when and how 
much pressure should be applied for maximum results and minimal Japanese 
resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Japanese side, complacency stems from the perception that the United 
States is too preoccupied with its own domestic problems and with 
foreign-policy crises to worry much about Japan. There is also a sense that the 
United States is increasingly dependent on Japan's goodwill and support -- 
whether for "strategic alliances" between corporations, security cooperation as 
on the Korean peninsula, personnel for peacekeeping operations as in Cambodia 
or for financial assistance as in Russia and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 As for opportunity, the Clinton Administration missed a golden one in early 
1993 to set a fundamentally new course for the U.S.-Japan relationship. 
Japanese officials and business leaders fully expected the new Administration 
to institute policies that would force Japan to accept more U.S. products, 
services and investment in return for continued access to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhetoric coming from the Clinton team certainly gave that impression. By 
calling for "results," "targets" and "objective indicators," the Administration 
put Japan on notice that, unlike the Republicans, it would not settle for mere 
changes in procurement rules or procedures. But the flaw was threefold. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the rhetoric was not supported by a clear, coherent, consistent policy 
toward Japan. Depending on the day and the official being quoted, the request 
or "demand" was described as targets, goals, results, objective criteria, 
quantitative indicators, qualitative indicators, benchmarks, yardsticks, 
reciprocity, transparency or none of the above. The clear impression left in 
Japan was that the Administration was wavering. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the Administration's inattention early on allowed Japan to undertake a 
remarkably successful public-relations campaign that depicted the United States 
as a "protectionist" nation advocating "managed trade." Southeast Asian 
countries and many members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development were persuaded by Japan that if the United States were successful 
in pursuing a results-oriented trade policy toward it, they, too, would face 
similar pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the U.S. rhetoric was not backed up by action. The Administration 
failed to understand the cardinal principle in negotiating with Japan: Speak 
softly and carry a big stick. Instead, the Administration did the opposite; it 
cried wolf repeatedly but took no action. From Tokyo's perspective, the 
construction scandal was a test of whether the Clinton team would act 
differently from the Reagan and Bush teams. With more than 30 senior Japanese 
government officials and executives arrested in 1993 for bid-rigging, bribery 
and collusion in the construction industry, many Japanese knew that if there 
was ever a clear case of illegal activity that excluded competitive foreign 
companies from the Japanese market, this was it. Inaction by the Clinton 
Administration was seen in Japan not as a gesture of generosity but as a sign 
of weakness.

GELINAS PROVES TO BE BARGAIN AS CANUCKS BEAT KINGS, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You certainly have to do some selective shopping when it comes to the waiver 
wire. Mostly, you rummage through the rabble. Very few players who go through 
waivers are worth bothering to make an effort to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's left wing Martin Gelinas, who scored twice in Vancouver's 3-1 
victory over the Kings on Monday before 16,040 at Pacific Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a young guy, 23, who already acquired a Stanley Cup ring when he was with 
the Edmonton Oilers. And he's not some high-priced aging veteran. Gelinas makes 
a palatable $300,000 (Canadian). 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver General Manager and Coach Pat Quinn claimed Gelinas on waivers from 
Quebec on Jan. 15, and Gelinas made his move look superb Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings (19-25-6) remain in an eighth-place tie with the Mighty Ducks for 
the final playoff spot in the Western Conference and slipped eight points 
behind the Canucks in the Pacific Division. The Kings have won only once in 
their last seven games, going 1-4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings things back to Gelinas. Since the Kings are searching for more 
depth and extra offense outside of Wayne Gretzky, Luc Robitaille and Jari 
Kurri, it might have been interesting if they had claimed Gelinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly they had a chance. The Canucks, by virtue of their better record, 
picked him up after the Kings turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good player," King Coach Barry Melrose said. "Vancouver was very smart 
in picking him up. I always liked him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings were drastically undermanned Monday. Robitaille missed his first 
game since Nov. 27, 1990, because of a sprained right ankle, suffered on 
Saturday against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Tony Granato had a flare-up of back spasms during Monday's morning 
skate. Left wing Warren Rychel also sat out, serving a one-game suspension for 
having accumulated three game misconducts. 
</P>
<P>
 Right wing Dave Taylor was back home after a recurrence of headaches and 
forward Gary Shuchuk will miss six weeks because of a sprained left knee. So 
the Kings called up Keith Redmond from Phoenix, and defenseman Brent Thompson 
moved to wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings were also worn down by constant penalty killing, shutting down 
Vancouver, which went 0 for eight. Also not helping the mood were the postgame 
antics of Canuck forward Gino Odjick, who went after Gretzky after the final 
buzzer. Odjick was assessed a 10-minute misconduct and Gretzky wound up with a 
sore neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's ridiculous," King defenseman Darryl Sydor said. "He's done that 
every game now." 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The long saga of Wayne Gretzky's new three-year, $25.5 million contract 
appears to be drawing to a close. He agreed in principle about four months ago 
but has not signed the deal yet. Several times, it seemed as the transaction 
was almost completed. "You have to file everything with the league now," 
Gretzky said on Monday. "And with new ownership, they have to agree on 
everything. It's made it more complicated. But everybody understands it will 
get done." Presumably, Gretzky will sign the contract when he returns to Los 
Angeles after this two-game trip. Among the various issues prolonging the 
transaction was the NHL vetoing a no-trade clause and the specific legal 
language dealing with the deferred payments from Gretzky's previous contract. 
The final issues were discussed in a 2 1/2-hour meeting on Monday between King 
owner Bruce McNall, soon-to-be owners Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joe Cohen, Gretzky's 
agent Michael Barnett and Gretzky's lawyer Ron Fujikawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings on Monday fired Tim Bothwell, the coach of their minor league team 
in Phoenix and replaced him with Rick Dudley. Bothwell had coached the 
struggling Roadrunners for two seasons. His record was 26-50-6 last season and 
19-26-2 this season.

 The Clippers could have used forward Mark Aguirre in Monday night's 110-96 
loss to the Golden State Warriors before 9,281 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aguirre, who provided instant offense as a reserve, was released before 
the game to make room for forward John Williams, who is expected to be 
activated soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clipper offense seemed flat without Aguirre, the ninth-best three-point 
shooter in the NBA this season, as they fell behind by 17 points at halftime. 
Fans who were seated behind the Clipper bench, apparently unaware that Aguirre 
had been released, called for him, but he was home preparing to move his family 
to Dallas, where he owns a business. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the Clippers have used Aguirre? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a non-issue at this point," Clipper forward Danny Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior guard Latrell Sprewell made four three-point shots en route to a 
game-high 32 points, 20 in the first quarter. Chris Webber had 20 points and 
five rebounds as the Warriors (23-18) ended a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who ended the first half of the season with a 15-26 record, 
compared to 22-19 at the midway point of last season, had to play the final 
2:58 without Manning, who scored 18 points before he was ejected for arguing 
with referee Ted Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, who received a double technical foul, was tackled by rookie guard 
Harold Ellis to prevent him from going after Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he read my mind," Manning said of the official. "I didn't say 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to assess the first half of the season, Clipper guard Mark Jackson said, 
"We're not as good a team (as last season). We're as good potentially, but not 
as good when we get out on the floor. We're just too inconsistent. With a good 
team, you know that every night you're going to get effort and every night 
you're going to be in the ballgame, and we just don't know sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, who had been averaging 10.6 points in 22 minutes this season, was 
informed of his release by phone Monday. He cleaned out his locker before the 
game and was gone by the time his teammates arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, 34, who said last week that he planned to retire at the end of the 
season, was waived by the Clippers to make room for Williams, who returned to 
the team after spending the last four months at a weight-reduction center at 
Duke University. Williams is still suspended without pay, but he could be 
activated for Saturday's game against Sacramento at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "John coming back is in the very near future, and his minutes are going to 
come from Mark Aguirre's minutes," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said. "When I 
brought Mark here, I told him it was to play. I didn't think he was getting 
enough minutes to be as happy as he wanted to be, as things were. It was only 
going to get worse. I didn't want Mark as the 10th, 11th or 12th man. It's 
better for Mark to be able to go somewhere else and better for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The move caught Aguirre by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't understand the reason," Aguirre said. "They talked to me today. 
They felt like there weren't going to be enough minutes (for him and Williams). 
They made a business decision. I'd just gotten comfortable with the guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, in his 13th NBA season, said he probably won't try to catch on with 
another team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even thought about that yet," Aguirre said.

ANALYSIS; COMMERCIALS DON'T MEASURE UP TO HYPE 
</P>

 Maybe it's because they long for the '60s, or perhaps they just prefer folk 
and rock to rap music, but an assortment of advertising executives Monday chose 
Pepsi's "Woodstock Reunion" spot as their favorite Super Bowl commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 In reviewing more than three dozen Super Bowl spots, six of the eight ad 
critics interviewed for this article chose the Woodstock spot, by ad agency 
BBDO, as one of the best. The ad includes kids who look on at the reminiscing 
adults and express hope that they won't skinny-dip again. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the critics, saying they may have been influenced by the recent cold 
weather, chose two sensuous and understated spots for Norwegian Cruise Line by 
Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein as among their favorites, although some questioned 
whether they were too soft-sell for the Super Bowl. "I would consider taking 
the cruise," said critic Ted Littleford, executive creative director at 
FCB/Leber Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the critics expressed dismay that, just like the Super Bowl itself, 
it's become very difficult for the ads to live up to expectations for the 
highly showcased event. They cited a Frito-Lay potato chips spot featuring 
former Vice President Dan Quayle as falling short of the advance hype. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just amazing to me how much money is blown on celebrities and 
extravagant productions," said Bill Oberlander, creative director at 
Kirshenbaum & Bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program was full of spots that tried so hard that they ended up looking 
desperate," said Brian Sitts, senior vice president and group creative director 
at J. Walter Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, he cited the sixth annual Bud Bowl with once dazzling computer 
animation that "has become ho-hum today." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the critics said a spot in which Cindy Crawford turns into Rodney 
Dangerfield after being deprived of Pepsi was overproduced and predictable. 
They also gave mediocre marks to a Pepsi spot starring taste-testing chimps, 
even though the ad got a record high score in a USA Today poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The execs split on two Nike ads starring Steve Martin that asked whether 
Michael Jordan had faked retirement. Some said the comedian was wasted; others 
said the spot was very entertaining. They also split on a Doritos Tortilla 
Thins ad in which Chevy Chase is fired and on Chrysler spots introducing the 
Neon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics said the use of a rapping and dunking Shaquille O'Neal for Reebok 
did not work. "The Reebok spot was pretty mind-numbing," said Julie 
Newton-Cucchi, creative director at Ogilvy & Mather. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad execs said that even if an ad works in normal programming, it may be 
wasted in an event that charges advertisers a whopping $900,000 per 30 seconds 
and that plays to a largely partying crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those advertisers that don't do commercials that are significant enough to 
get pre- or post-PR out of it are really wasting money," said Ron Berger of 
Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer. 
</P>
<P>
 As examples, the critics cited spots for Ray-O-Vac batteries that were heavy 
on graphics but short on entertainment, and a Goodyear spot with cars tugging 
water skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some spots went on too long, the critics said, citing a 90-second spot for 
Alamo rental cars, when a couple takes a 4-million-mile trip. "It went on so 
long I ended up feeling sorry for the family," Sitts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other spots have overextended their themes, critics said. A McDonald's spot 
last year that pitted Jordan against Larry Bird in a whimsical basketball 
showdown was warmly received, but the sequel stretching to outer space and 
adding Charles Barkley was not as popular. "The idea is tired," said Brent 
Bouchez, senior vice president at Ammirati & Puris. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, some critics said the use of basketball star Larry Johnson as 
"Grandmama" for Converse has grown tired, even with Wizard of Oz imagery. And 
7-Up ads using animated spots to wipe away the color of cola were not helped by 
the additions of humans in a casino, several critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ads were entertaining but seemed to have little to do with the product, 
said Jay Schulberg, vice chairman at Bozell. A few critics cited a Lipton Iced 
Tea spot that was a spoof of Kung Fu with David Carradine and The Three Stooges 
as looking more like a cola commercial, while others said it was clever. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, critics were impressed by a Reebok Insta-Pump spot with Emmitt 
Smith that looked almost like part of the game. Said Carmon Johnston, broadcast 
production director at Uniworld Group, "The star of the show was the Reebok ad 
that used actual highlight footage to cut a commercial live."

GILLOOLY RESENTED SYSTEM; FIGURE SKATING: SUSPICION OF FAVORITISM TOWARD 
KERRIGAN BY THE SPORT'S ESTABLISHMENT MAY HAVE SPAWNED ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brooding suspicions about the objectivity of judges and the fairness of 
scoring in women's figure skating may have motivated the attack on Nancy 
Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding's ex-husband is scheduled to appear in county court today amid 
signs he will plead guilty in the assault and, perhaps, flesh out for the first 
time his version of exactlywhat gave cause to the violent attempt to rig the 
1994 national women's figure skating championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say that Jeff Gillooly believed that his on-again, off-again spouse 
had been given a raw deal by skating judges, and that rival Kerrigan was 
plainly the favorite of the U.S. skating establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two events in particular were cited: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Resentment over what he and his ex-wife believed was unfair scoring of 
Harding's performances at an international competition in Japan last December. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cover-story treatment of Kerrigan in U.S. Figure Skating Assn. publications 
leading up to the Detroit national championships in January. 
</P>
<P>
 This account of investigators was published Monday in the Oregonian. The 
newspaper indicated it received the information from two days of interrogation 
Gillooly underwent at the FBI office in Portland last week. It was not verified 
by officials willing to speak publicly, or by court documents. Moreover, 
Gillooly's statements are sure to be subject of doubt and challenge in this 
strange case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly's attorney said a statement would be made today after Gillooly's 
court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly is believed to be seeking a reduced sentence by cooperating with the 
investigation. He is understood to have told authorities he discussed his 
planning of the attack with Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's more detailed account of Gillooly's story added this: Harding's 
fourth-place finish in Japan so angered him that he began planning the assault 
on his own, and then discussed it with her. The skater's first reaction was to 
question whether Gillooly's associate and her acquaintance, Shawn Eckardt, was 
the right man for the job. Gillooly explained that Eckardt was only a 
go-between. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has denied knowing of the plot beforehand. But she has admitted 
learning of events afterward and not reporting this to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-member committee of the U.S. Figure Staking Assn. is to meet in 
Colorado today and begin deliberations on whether Harding should be 
disqualified from the Olympic competition Feb. 23 and 25 in Lillehammer, 
Norway. A decision is not expected until the end of the week, at the soonest. 
For now, she and Kerrigan are the U.S. team's two entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Phillip Knight, chief executive officer of Nike, said that the 
company would donate $25,000 to Harding to defend herself, should she be taken 
off the Olympic team. Harding is not affiliated with Nike, but the company is 
based near Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the last year, Harding has finished fourth in skating competitions 
and complained about the judging. 
</P>
<P>
 After the January 1993 U.S. championships in Phoenix, she told a Portland 
journalist that she got a raw deal. Kerrigan won that competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, after the NHK international competition in Japan Dec. 9-12, 
Harding returned unhappy with her scores -- particularly her low marks in the 
mandatory technical program. Harding did not fall but was scored lower than 
skaters who did. Kerrigan did not enter that event. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the account published Monday, Gillooly said he and Harding 
brooded over what they believed was favoritism toward Kerrigan by the U.S. 
Figure Skating Assn. Mentioned was the cover story on Kerrigan in the 
association's monthly magazine in December. Also mentioned was a "brochure" 
that highlighted Kerrigan. This might have been the media guide for the Detroit 
competition, which featured Kerrigan and other 1993 U.S. champions on the 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledgeable skating enthusiasts noted, however, that Harding has been on the 
cover ofthe association magazine and was on the cover of at least one of the 
organization's brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 As an event that depends entirely on the opinion of a specialized clique of 
judges, and where style and presentation are hugely subjective, grumbling about 
scoring and favoritism in figure skating is fairly widespread, although usually 
discreet. 
</P>
<P>
 USFSA officials responded to the investigation in Portland by saying they did 
not want to be dragged into the discussion.

MORNING BRIEFING: MAYBE FOOTBALL IS HELL FOR A BUFFALO FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marv Levy is the host of a radio talk show in Buffalo, and the Bills' coach 
told Steve Jacobson of Newsday about a man who called him every week. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the caller: "Coach, I want you to know you're not doing the right thing. 
You've got to tell your players this is war; football is war, it's war, I'm 
telling you." 
</P>
<P>
 So Levy decided to tell the caller about Art Donovan, a defensive lineman of 
the Baltimore Colts who knew both war and football. 
</P>
<P>
 "And," Levy said, "Artie told me, 'Believe me, football isn't war.' But the 
caller kept it up and kept it up. So last week, I finally told the guy, 'I've 
done you a disservice. I checked back in history and interviewed a bunch of 
guys who landed on the beaches of Iwo Jima and Normandy. And when they went in, 
they were all yelling, 'This is football!' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What was unusual about USC's 1976-77 basketball season? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise guest: Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman will be on the "Tonight Show" 
with Jay Leno tonight, which is no great surprise. He was on after last year's 
Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise came Monday night. While Leno was reading a joke about Gatorade 
sales dropping because no one would drink anything that dissolved in Cowboy 
Coach Jimmy Johnson's hair, Leno acted as if he hadn't seen that one. Then he 
noticed that Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly was holding the cue card. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasant interlude: Among the top 10 things Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said to 
his team at halftime of the Super Bowl, according to David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10: "We won! Woo! We're Super Bowl champs!" and No. 7: "Now get out there 
and rest on your laurels." There were also No. 5: "What do you mean there's two 
more quarters?" and No. 4:. "Let's plan exactly how you're gonna dump the 
Gatorade on me." And No. 1? "Hey, fellas, more fudge?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still painful: As soon as Buffalo won the AFC championship and was headed for 
the Super Bowl, former Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton was ready for the 
onslaught of telephone calls. Tarkenton was the quarterback in three of the 
Vikings' four Super Bowl losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other sport puts a negative connotation on its players the way football 
does," Tarkenton told the Chicago Sun-Times. "It's promulgated by the media, 
who hear it from the idiot coaches. What offends me as a football person and a 
football fan is not just the idea (about) the Buffalo Bills, but that any team 
that loses the Super Bowl is worse than any team that hasn't been there." 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose Tarkenton got more phone calls Monday? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More pain: Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Sun believed that NBC laid it on a 
little thick in the late going of Sunday's Super Bowl telecast, repeatedly 
invading the private misery of Thurman Thomas. Jackman wrote: "It seemed like 
the perfect spot for someone to utter, 'The Bills should get rid of this guy,' 
but then there would be no 'drive for five' next year, would there?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is reality? In the 15,000-seat MGM Grand Garden arena Sunday, fans could 
pay $10 to watch what was billed as a "virtual reality Super Bowl." While the 
game was being shown on a large TV screen, Hall of Fame quarterbacks Dan Fouts 
and Bob Griese and former kicker Mark Moseley passed and kicked footballs 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Ram cheerleaders were there, and every time a pass was completed 
on TV, a fan got to come out of the stands to catch a pass from Fouts or 
Griese. Moseley kicked to fans after each kick in the real game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The Trojans won 11 of their first 12 games and then closed out 
that season with 15 consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>

 Quotebook: Michael Jordan, on his attempt to become a professional baseball 
player: "I am about to turn 31 years old. I am not a child. I know what I'm 
doing. I know there are people who have said: 'You retired from the Bulls, so 
just go away and let us remember what used to be.' If these people are tired of 
hearing my name, then they ought to quit saying it so often." MARYANN HUDSON

NHL ROUNDUP; RANGERS POWER PAST PENGUINS AS GARTNER SCORES A HAT TRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Gartner scored three power-play goals and the New York Rangers defeated 
the Pittsburgh Penguins, 5-3, Monday night in a battle of division leaders at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner's first two goals helped the Rangers gain a 4-0 lead midway through 
the second period.Gartner also scored a third-period goal that gave him 24 for 
the season and 607 for his career -- three behind Bobby Hull for fifth place on 
the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Gartner's 19th hat trick, fourth with the Rangers and first against the 
Penguins. It was the first Ranger hat trick since Ed Olczyk scored three 
against Philadelphia on March 24, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlantic Division-leading Rangers, 6-1-0 in their last seven games, 
improved their league-best mark to 33-13-3. The Northeast-leading Penguins, who 
came into Madison Square Garden with a three-game winning streak, lost for only 
the second time in the last 11 games (6-2-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 1, Ottawa 0 -- Ed Belfour stopped 19 shots for his fifth shutout of 
the season and Eric Weinrich's goal was enough for a Blackhawk victory at 
Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Belfour faced a furious flurry by the Senators in the final minute after they 
pulled goalie Craig Billington for an extra attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 4, Quebec 3 -- Cam Neely scored his 35th and 36th goals as the Bruins 
extended their unbeaten streak to seven games with a victory over the Nordiques 
at Boston.

NBA ROUNDUP; MAVERICKS COME CLOSE, BUT LOSE TO HAWKS, 90-85 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks were tired Monday night, but not tired enough to lose to the 
hapless Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins scored 14 of his 24 points during a 36-19 third-quarter 
charge as the Hawks, playing for the fifth time in seven days, overcame a 
sluggish start to hold off the Mavericks, 90-85, at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell guys to keep focused, but there's always that tendency to 
concentrate on their record," Hawk Coach Lenny Wilkens said. "Dallas is playing

that."

 The Mavericks, who snapped a league-record 19-game home losing streak Saturday 
night with a victory over the Sacramento Kings, gave the Hawks a scare as Doug 
Smith scored a season-high 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas had a 11-2 rally to close to 88-85 with 47 seconds to play, but Jamal 
Mashburn missed a three-pointer that would have tied the score with three 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Mookie Blaylock's two free throws with 0.9 seconds left sealed the victory for 
the Hawks, who trailed by six points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Close doesn't count," the Mavericks' Jim Jackson said. "You've got to finish 
it off. We had some breaks down the stretch, but we didn't take advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 107, Detroit 103 -- Mark Price scored six points down the stretch as 
the Cavaliers handed the Pistons their 10th consecutive home loss, which ties 
the club record. 
</P>
<P>
 Pistons, 5-17 at the Palace at Auburn Hills, Mich., have lost 20 of their last 
21 overall and six in a row. Their last victory at home was in overtime, 98-92, 
over Cleveland on Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Nance had 20 points for the Cavaliers, who are 7-14 on the road but have 
won three of their last four there. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Dumars scored 29 points for the Pistons. Isiah Thomas had 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the third quarter, Price and Thomas collided, knocking Price dizzy. 
But he was able to come back and deliver the knockout punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what he does," Cleveland Coach Mike Fratello said. "Mark gets battered 
and banged around, but he just keeps going."

HERNANDEZ DOES JOB, FINISHES OFF RAMIREZ; BOXING: NEXT FOR JUNIOR-LIGHTWEIGHT 
CHAMPION IS SURGERY TO REPLACE SCREW IN HIS HAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Genaro Hernandez, who entered the fight all set to take a six-month layoff, 
cruised through the early rounds, landed a flurry of combinations as the fight 
progressed, then took out Jorge (Cocas) Ramirez at 2:35 of the eighth round 
Monday night before 4,549 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Hernandez soaked his sore hands in ice and prepared for a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, bleeding heavily from two cuts near his right eye, did not protest 
when the referee stopped the fight with Hernandez firing hard left hooks 
without Ramirez answering. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hernandez, it was his seventh successful defense of the World Boxing Assn. 
junior-lightweight title, and it comes as he prepares to take a layoff due to 
imminent surgery to replace a screw in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez (30-0-1, with 15 knockouts), who flinched several times after 
landing with the sore hand, said he wanted to make sure he was patient against 
the veteran Ramirez (64-11-3). 
</P>
<P>
 On all three judges' cards, Hernandez won every round. 
</P>
<P>
 The champion, five inches taller than the challenger, allowed himself to be 
caught on the ropes several times in the early going, choosing to absorb 
Ramirez's short punches in exchange for big hooks of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just went out there to do what I do best, and that's box," Hernandez said. 
"I wanted to take my time, relax, use my skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went in knowing I'm better than Cocas Ramirez, I'm a better fighter. I 
wasn't overconfident, but I knew. I didn't want to go out there just throwing 
punches all over and being careless." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first two rounds, Hernandez did not move much and stood up straight as 
Ramirez bored into him. By the middle of the second, Ramirez had a small cut 
under his eye and Hernandez had been hit with some solid inside shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did that on purpose," Hernandez said. "My brother told me I was getting 
the better of those exchanges. We knew that Cocas is an inside puncher and when 
he does that he tends to open up and I could get him with some clean shots." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez's generally sluggish appearance in the first two rounds worried 
his corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wondering when he was going to wake up and get into this fight," said 
Hernandez's brother and trainer, Rudy. "He was just enjoying himself, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew he has a long layoff after this, and maybe he just wanted to stay in 
there, box, and get as much work as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 By the third, Hernandez began to control the fight, slugging it out with 
Ramirez in the middle of the ring at the end of the round and knocking him back 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth, Hernandez teed off on Ramirez and opened up a large cut over the 
challenger's eye, producing large amounts of blood for the rest of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the fight, with Ramirez throwing few punches, Hernandez picked 
him with thudding left hooks and occasionally flashing the right across 
Ramirez's wide open chin. There were no knockdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez admitted he backed off at times when he could have gone in for the 
kill to make sure Ramirez didn't head-butt him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big problem he has," Rudy Hernandez said. "He doesn't want to get 
cut with a head butt and it's hard to be effective inside when you do that. We 
haven't figured that out yet.' 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said both his hands hurt after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez has surgery scheduled for February for his hand, and said his first 
fight after the surgery will be a mandatory defense of his title. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier fights, Young Dick Tiger scored an impressive first-round technical 
knockout over Florencio Loprez Ibarra, landing a sharp left hook that dropped 
him hard to the canvas. The referee stopped it at 2:34 of the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger raised his record to 29-10 (19 KOs) and Ibarra fell to 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In a heavyweight bout, Dave Dixon (17-2, 15 KOs) took a technical knockout of 
Gary Winmon (13-2) at 2:27 of the first round.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
 Who says it's so hard to repeat? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys have won the last two Super Bowls, the Chicago Bulls the 
last three NBA championships, and the Toronto Blue Jays the last two World 
Series. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But you have to go back to 1962 for the last time there were repeat winners in 
all three sports -- the Green Bay Packers in the NFL, the Boston Celtics in the 
NBA, and the New York Yankees in baseball. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nevada bookmakers have already established the Cowboys as favorites to become 
the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowls. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dallas should remain on top for at least another year simply because it has 
the best players and the best coach in the league. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I agree with Emmitt Smith. Cowboy safety James Washington from UCLA and Jordan 
High should have been voted most valuable player of the game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In 28 Super Bowls, the only defensive players to win the award have been 
linebacker Chuck Howley of Dallas in V, safety Jake Scott of Miami in VII, 
tackle Randy White and end Harvey Martin of Dallas co-honored in XII, and end 
Richard Dent of Chicago in XX. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What do the voters have against defenders from L.A.? . . .

<P>
 Oakland Raider linebacker Rod Martin from USC and Hamilton High intercepted 
three Philadelphia passes in Super Bowl XV, but quarterback Jim Plunkett was 
voted most valuable. . . .

 Don't look for Duke to remain No. 1 in the college basketball polls for long. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils' next game is Thursday at North Carolina. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is disappointing that such a fundamentally sound player as Jason Kidd of 
California is as inept as most college shooters from the free-throw line. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA-USC game Thursday at Pauley Pavilion is a sellout, but, surprise, 
will be televised live by Channel 5. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Leslie of USC and Natalie Williams of UCLA, the two best collegiate 
women's forwards in town and probably the nation, will play Friday at the Lyon 
Center. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Leslie was named by 58% of voters who were asked to select the top two 
midseason candidates for the Naismith Award. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 John Robinson has reversed the pattern at USC, where Larry Smith never 
recruited many quality junior college transfers. . . .

 If the Washington Capitals keep winning under Jim Schoenfeld, the move from 
the ESPN studio back to coaching might become as fashionable as the move from 
NBC. . . .

have been elected to the board of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los

of his greatest attributes -- stamina. . . .

 The Grand Olympic Auditorium already has set a house record with more than 
$300,000 in sales for the March 5 card featuring Oscar De La Hoya.Of course,

simply as the Olympic Auditorium and the promoter was Aileen Eaton. . . .

 No wonder the NBA and NHL have such light schedules on Super Sunday. The crowd 
of 12,862 at Santa Anita was about 25% below normal Sunday. . . .

 Doug Peterson, who trained Seattle Slew after his Triple Crown victories, has 
a promising 3-year-colt, Fly'n J. Bryan, who won his Santa Anita debut by 4 1/2 
lengths. . . .

 Surprise of the meeting is Fernando Valenzuela, the jockey. He has ridden 20 
winners in the first 28 days, more than defending champion Gary Stevens, Eddie 
Delahoussaye, or cousin Patrick Valenzuela. . . .

 L.A. Marathon director Bill Burke, who says he has received hundreds of calls 
from people concerned that the race would be canceled because of the 
earthquake, reports that everything is still a go for March 6. . . .

 "We also are going ahead with the painting of the largest freeway mural in the 
world on the Santa Monica Freeway, only 200 yards from where it collapsed," 
Burke said. . . .

 Ben Crenshaw, who supervised the construction of the rebuilt greens and 
bunkers at Riviera Country Club, will be able to test them next week during the

NOTRE DAME BREAKS STREAK AT NORTHRIDGE'S EXPENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good day for Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad night. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge had an enjoyable tour of some of the historical landmarks around 
the Notre Dame campus on Monday, and even got to glad-hand Irish football Coach 
Lou Holtz after its morning shoot-around. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Matadors went out and graciously helped Notre Dame snap a six-game 
losing streak, 76-58, before 8,402 at Joyce Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the luck of the Irish was not with Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy, 
who started his head coaching career at Notre Dame -- the high school in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, Cassidy & Co. seem to be governed by Murphy's Law. 
</P>
<P>
 First came the tragedy of the Jan. 17 earthquake, then the death of center 
Peter Micelli's father, then the news that forward Chris Yard was out for the 
season with knee and hand injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy hoped a return to basketball on a two-day trip that started Saturday 
in Chicago against Northeastern Illinois would be "therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
 For the mind, perhaps. But not for the basketball skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Notre Dame, the Matadors (3-14) committed 17 turnovers and shot poorly 
-- 41% -- even by their standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to sum up the experience, Cassidy replied, "Life on the road is hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach, get used to it. Northridge doesn't have a home game for another 10 
days. And even that, with the damage to the team's home court, seems 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, the Matadors have seen the last of Notre Dame forward 
Monty Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a standout player on an otherwise average team, paced Notre Dame 
(6-13) with 20 points -- a modest total considering he scored 34 against Duke 
and 31 against Providence in his previous two games. He also had 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Andre Chevalier and Brooklyn McLinn paced Northridge with 15 and 14 
points. However, the Matadors' starting front line of Micelli, Brent Lofton and 
Shawn Stone combined for only 12 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish, who play host to used-to-be top-ranked UCLA on Saturday, earned a 
40-24 rebounding edge and outscored Northridge, 36-14, inside the key. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge did score sympathy points with an unusually polite Irish crowd and 
a local media contingent, which were far more curious about the quake than they 
were Northridge's basketball fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake had nothing to do with this game," Micelli said. "We just have to 
play harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge led only once, 2-0, though the Matadors were only down by a basket, 
24-22, with 4 minutes 30 seconds in the half. Then the Irish ran off nine 
consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame boosted its lead to as many as 20 points in the second half before 
Coach John MacLeod mercifully emptied his bench. All 16 players in uniform saw 
action, and 11 scored. Guard Keith Kurowski had 13 points for Notre Dame and 
reserve floor leader Admore White had eight points nine assists and four 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish had not won since upsetting Missouri, 77-73, on Jan. 12. "It's great 
to see the guys smiling and laughing again," MacLeod said. "It's an ordeal when 
you go 2 1/2 weeks without a win." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which has lost four in a row, can relate. The Matadors' last win 
came more than three weeks ago.

COLLEGE BASEBALL PREVIEW; CAL STATE FULLERTON WILL BE DAUNTING WITH DANTE AT 
BAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dante Powell did not waste any time making his pivotal junior season an 
impressive one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Fullerton center fielder had seven hits in 15 at-bats, drove in 
three runs and stole four bases last weekend as the Titans won two of three 
games in a season-opening series at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell has been looking forward to this season since 1991, when he passed up a 
$425,000 offer from the Toronto Blue Jays after they chose him with a 
supplemental first-round draft pick out of Long Beach Millikan High. Powell, 6 
feet 2 and 185 pounds, is expected to be one of the first players chosen in 
this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 With Powell leading the way, Fullerton is expected to win the Big West 
Conference title and reach the College World Series for the second time in 
three years. Fullerton lost to Pepperdine in the 1992 national championship 
game. Last season, the Titans were eliminated by USC in the Central II Regional 
at Austin, Tex., and finished 35-19. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team compares to the one I played on as a freshman," said Powell, who 
batted .335 with 12 home runs, 57 runs batted in and 42 stolen bases last 
season. "We have a lot of experience and leadership mixed with some talented 
incoming players.  
</P>
<P>
 "This year, I'll probably take more of a leadership role. It's a natural move 
because I'm pretty vocal." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton has a veteran pitching staff, including senior right-hander Dan 
Ricabal, who was 11-3 with a 3.49 earned-run average last season, and junior 
right-hander Mike Parisi (10-3, 4.71). Adam Millan (.354, seven homers, 57 
RBIs) moved from catcher to first base, and second baseman Jeff Ferguson (.318) 
and outfielder Jim Betzold (.310) also returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers include freshman left-hander Mark Kotsay and freshman outfielder 
Jeremy Giambi. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido said the Titans' success will be tied to 
Powell's ability to deal with the pressure of performing during his draft year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to have a big impact on this team," Garrido said. "If he is 
distracted and intimidated by it, then his progress will be slow. You can't 
play to a mythical expectation level." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the other Southland Division I teams: 
</P>
<P>
 * USC 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 35-29 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Trojans came within a bounce of advancing to the championship 
game against Texas in the Central II Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Gillespie has seven starting position players back, including 
sophomore shortstop Gabe Alvarez (.326), a freshman All- American last season. 
Sophomore outfielder Geoff Jenkins (.323) is coming off a dominant summer in 
the Alaska League, and junior third baseman Aaron Boone (.286) is a 
All-American candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Like every team in the Pacific 10 Southern Division, the Trojans have an 
untested pitching staff. Senior right-hander Tony Nieto, who began his college 
career as a catcher, is the ace. Nieto was 8-5 with a 3.52 ERA last season. Ben 
Tucker (2-7, 5.37) and Grant Vermillion (3-2, 5.67) will also be starters. USC 
must find a way to offset the loss of closer Dan Hubbs, who had 18 saves in 
1993. Justin Parle (3-0, 4.57) will be the No. 1 reliever.  
</P>
<P>
 * UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 37-23 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Adams, in his 20th season as coach of the Bruins, lost seven of the nine 
players drafted off last year's team that advanced to the Central I Regional at 
College Station, Tex., including All-American first baseman Ryan McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Mike Mitchell (.314, 12 homers) replaces McGuire at first base. Senior 
outfielder David Roberts (.296, 28 steals) and infielder Travis Boyd, a 
redshirt junior, have returned after rejecting pro offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Redshirt sophomore Brian Stephenson (5-4, 4.85 and four saves), a transfer 
from UC Santa Barbara, is the Bruins' No. 1 starter. The Bruin staff also 
includes freshmen Seth Bean, 12-1 at Lompoc High in 1993, and John Phillips, 
14-0 at Bullard High in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 * LONG BEACH STATE 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 46-19 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, who came within three outs of playing for the national championship 
last season, are trying to make their fourth World Series appearance in six 
seasons under Coach Dave Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 To get there, Long Beach must find a way to replace Daniel Choi, who was 17-2 
as a draft-eligible sophomore last year. Choi signed a professional contract in 
Korea, elevating Mike Fontana (9-3, 2.94) to staff ace. The 49ers also have 
left-hander Gabe Gonzalez (4-3, 1.54, 13 saves), who suffered the season-ending 
loss to eventual national champion Louisiana State. Freshman right-hander 
Marcus Jones should also figure prominently. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore first baseman Jeff Liefer (.356, 12 homers, 54 RBIs) is the top 
returning position player. Key newcomers include Snow's son, Casey, a freshman 
catcher, and outfielder Rolando Avila and shortstop Ryan Miller, who are JC 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 * PEPPERDINE 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 41-17 
</P>
<P>
 An influx of talented transfers and freshmen could give the Waves a legitimate 
shot at their ninth West Coast Conference championship in 10 seasons and their 
second NCAA title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Coached by Andy Lopez, Pepperdine already had a formidable pitching staff with 
sophomore starters Greg Gregory (7-3, 2.65) and Jason LeBlanc (7-4, 2.83), and 
senior relievers Mauricio Estavil (5-0, 2.64, five saves) and Adam Housley 
(4-4, 1.93, four saves). It got even stronger when Jason Dietrich transferred 
from Rancho Santiago College, Cade Gaspar transferred from Saddleback College 
and Matt Wise passed up a six-figure pro offer and joined the Waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Other transfers who will have an immediate impact include catcher Keith 
McDonald and first baseman Greg Tippin from Cypress College, second baseman 
David Rosato from Harbor College and infielder David Newhan from Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 * LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Record: 23-33 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions have one of the most talented two-way players in the country in 
junior Jesse Ibarra, who was selected in the fifth round of last year's draft 
by the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra batted .299 with 17 homers and was 2-1 with a 3.41 ERA and four saves 
in 1993. Junior outfielder Mike Peters (.365) and senior first baseman Anthony 
Napolitano (.315) will help Coach Jody Robinson's team in the West Coast 
Conference race. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Shawn Hammett (7-8, 5.38) and sophomore Ryan Graves (5- 6, 4.59) are 
the top returning pitchers. Freshman Jason Hueth is the top recruit on the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
 * CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Record: 36-20 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, under Coach Bill Kernen, are seeking their fourth consecutive 
regional appearance since joining Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kempton (10-4, 3.99), Marco Contreras (8-4, 3.98) and Johnny Najar (5-2, 
5.93) have returned from a staff that helped the Matadors advance to the West I 
regional at Tempe, Ariz. Senior second baseman Keyaan Cook (.306) is the top 
returning hitter. First baseman Jason Shanahan (.271) and center fielder Joey 
Arnold (.264) also are back. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Eric Gillespie and first baseman Andy Shaw are highly regarded 
freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 * UC SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Record: 24-30-1 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos have a new coach in Bob Brontsema and a new facility in 1,000-seat 
Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. They also have three talented sophomores in first 
baseman/pitcher Jared Janke (.330, 13 homers), outfielder Wynter Phoenix (.315) 
and third baseman Zach Elliott (.307). 
</P>
<P>
 Senior shortstop Matt Bokemeier (.342) is the most experienced player. 
</P>
<P>
 * CHAPMAN 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Record: 22-32 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, under first-year Coach Rex Peters, will play only two games 
against Division I opponents this season as they prepare to move to Division 
III next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-hander James Thomas, who had tendinitis last season, has beaten 
Pepperdine, UCLA and USC during his career.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; IN FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT, LEAGUE STILL HAS PUNCH 
LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the traditionalists, all the Don Cherry fans who predicted that the 
NHL would become soft under an American commissioner, fear not. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting is actually on the rise this season, judging from the 41% increase in 
major fighting penalties assessed through Sunday. In 651 games, 1,056 fighting 
majors had been handed out, contrasted with 747 fighting majors in 651 games 
last season. That should keep all the makers of fight tapes in business and 
delight Cherry, the acerbic TV analyst who proclaimed that the NHL was on the 
verge of becoming a pacifists' paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL executives say the new numbers reflect increased competitiveness. 
Divisional rivalries always fostered rough stuff, but conference rankings now 
determine playoff seedings instead of division standings. There are more 
intraconference games than intradivision games, providing more opportunities 
for fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's because of the conference format, and I think it should level 
off as teams establish those turf battles," said Brian Burke, NHL senior vice 
president and director of hockey operations. "If it doesn't, then we have to 
find out what the reason is." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman said his priority is to eliminate 
"extracurriculars," such as head-butts, checks from behind and dangerous 
stickwork, through supplementary discipline -- meaning suspensions -- before he 
deals with fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had eight suspensions in October, eight in November, three in December and 
two in January, one of which (Rick Zombo's slash of Kevin Collins) could have 
been a rulebook suspension," Bettman said. "At this particular point in time 
we're not focused on that (fighting) issue. At some point we'll study it, 
because at some point we're going to study everything." 
</P>
<P>
 That study would find players opposed to a ban on fighting. "I don't think you 
can ever take it out of the game," Detroit defenseman Paul Coffey said. "It's 
probably not as premeditated as in the past. You'll see a couple of guys fight 
for 30 seconds and it's over. If you talk to a lot of players, you'll find 
they'll take a punch in the head over a stick in the face or stick in the 
groin." STANDARDS, PLEASE 
</P>
<P>
 We can live with flying ducks making hokey entrances at Anaheim Arena and with 
Harvey the Hound, the Calgary Flames' mascot, doing a mock striptease by hiking 
up his costume pants and twirling his dog collar in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 But sumo hockey, that's time to draw the line. 
</P>
<P>
 A new intermission show around the NHL features two contestants, dressed like 
the Michelin tire man and wearing sumo wrestler headgear, "playing" hockey. 
With their bulk, all they do is slip-slide along the ice as they shoot the puck 
into nets set against the side boards. When they fall, they struggle like 
turtles to get up. All this for the glory of a certain beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, fans deserve to be entertained all night when they shell out big bucks 
for tickets. But there must be something better than that . CAPITAL OFFENSES 
</P>
<P>
 They tried Bryan Murray. They tried his brother, Terry Murray. And still the 
Washington Capitals can't get past the early rounds of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They passed up Winnipeg assistant Andy Murray (no relation) when they fired 
Terry Murray and lured Jim Schoenfeld out of the ESPN booth to coach. 
Washington hasn't missed the playoffs since 1982, but would be an outsider if 
the season were to end today. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld, a fiery leader in Buffalo and New Jersey, has an emotional spark 
the listless Capitals need. The key is whether he has learned to temper his 
impatience, which undermined his stay with the Devils and led to his firing 14 
games into the 1989-90 season. Even if he succeeds, it might be too late to 
save General Manager David Poile, whose contract is up at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld's return is likely to increase sales of diet programs among 
referees. Remember, Schoenfeld earned hockey immortality during the 1988 
playoffs when he screamed at Don Koharski, "Have another doughnut, you fat 
pig." You've got to love a guy who finds that the worst thing he can say. HOLD 
THAT MIKE 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld joins a parade of broadcasters leaving studios and press tables to 
coach. Pat Riley of the New York Knicks, Quinn Buckner of the Dallas Mavericks 
and Mike Fratello of the Cleveland Cavaliers made the jump in the NBA. The 
NHL's list includes Jacques Demers, who did radio work between leaving the Red 
Wings in 1990 and joining the Montreal Canadiens in '92; and Mike Keenan, who 
was a radio and TV analyst between jobs with the Chicago Blackhawks and New 
York Rangers. TIP OF THE SALARY CAP 
</P>
<P>
 League officials were furious when the NHL Players Assn. spread word it had 
rejected a collective bargaining proposal that involved a salary cap. As the 
league saw it, that violated an agreement to avoid commenting on talks. It 
won't help the tone of negotiations, which resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 The association is adamant about rejecting any form of cap, but Bettman is 
expected to press for it, and the possibility of a player strike increases with 
every verbal salvo. So does the pessimism of Ranger fans, who figure that since 
the only thing that can keep them from winning the Stanley Cup is a strike, a 
strike is sure to be called. Two years ago, the Rangers finished first overall 
but were thrown off stride by a brief April walkout and lost in the second 
round of the playoffs. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks believe the NHL is discriminating against them by assigning 
young, inexperienced referees to their games. They have a point: In 27 of their 
45 games, the referee had two years' experience or less. Also, neither Kerry 
Fraser nor Andy van Hellemond, considered the top referees, has worked at 
Anaheim Arena, although every referee is supposed to work everywhere once. 
"It's a concern," General Manager Jack Ferreira said of the assignments. . . . 
The Rangers had a deal with the Vancouver Canucks for center Petr Nedved but 
backed out when Nedved's agent, Tony Kondel, demanded a $1.4-million payment 
and more in performance bonuses. . . . The Toronto Maple Leafs will have to 
sustain their 7-0-3 streak without defenseman Bob Rouse, who had arthroscopic 
knee surgery and is out at least two weeks. . . . Roger Neilson's defensive 
system isn't pretty, but Florida keeps winning. The Panthers have given up only 
17 goals during their 5-0-4 surge, the longest unbeaten streak ever by an 
expansion club.

 Basketball / Guard

<P>
 Negrete, with a 10-point scoring average entering last Friday's game against 
Trabuco Hills, isn't the type of player for whom special defenses are 
created."He does a little bit of everything that makes you good," Century Coach 
Greg Coombs said. "And he did a lot the other night." Negrete scored a 
career-high 26 points, including 14 in the first quarter, in an 80-57 victory 
over the then third-ranked Mustangs. He made seven of eight shots in the first 
quarter -- and on his only miss he got the rebound and scored. Other notables: 
</P>
<P>
 * Josh Cameron, Southern California Christian, averaged 27 points in victories 
over Anza Hamilton, Riverside Sherman Indian and CSDR. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lupe Rodriguez, St. Margaret's, scored 26 points, including six of six 
three-pointers, and had eight assists in a victory over Liberty Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vince Virgen, Buena Park, pinned Sunny Hills' Dean Roman at 135 pounds to 
help the Coyotes to a 34-24 victory.

PREP ROUNDUP; NO. 1 CORONA DEL MAR SHUTS OUT SANTA MARGARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Margarita Coach Curt Bauer didn't offer any excuses or explanations for 
his team's 3-0 loss to top-ranked Corona del Mar Monday. He simply stated the 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They beat us the first 20 minutes," Bauer said. "That's why they're the No. 1 
team and we're not. They're a better team and there's not much else to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, but Santa Margarita sweeper John Bamford added some insight anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came out harder than we did," Bamford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Dustin Lee appeared to come out the hardest of all the Sea Kings. 
He scored two goals in six minutes and almost had a third except for a 
spectacular save by goalkeeper Brian Casola. 
</P>
<P>
 And though he was on the sideline nursing a sore leg, Lee was directly 
responsible for the Sea Kings' third goal. He was kicked by a Santa Margarita 
player, resulting in a penalty kick for the Sea Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jed Weinstein converted by easily slipping the ball past a diving Casola in 
the left corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The play got extremely physical from there as Santa Margarita tried to get 
back into the game. The Eagles' best chance to score came with minutes left to 
play when midfielder Chon Kantikvit's drive glanced off the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get frustrated if things don't go right," Lee said. "They started 
yelling at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-ranked Saddleback fell to 11-3-4 and 4-3-4 in the Sea View League. 
Corona del Mar improved to 16-2-3, 9-0-1. But things don't get any easier for 
Corona del Mar, which plays today at third-ranked Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who made our schedule, but if we can get by this week, we're in 
the clear," Lee said. DAVE McKIBBEN

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: INCIDENTS SHAKE UP SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a difficult couple of weeks for the Simi Valley High boys' 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems began on Jan. 14 when Coach Dean Bradshaw shoved senior reserve 
guard Sam Rodriguez for not playing well during the fourth quarter of a 
Marmonte League game against Westlake. Rodriguez, pulled from the game, was 
walking toward the bench when Bradshaw grabbed him by the neck and shoved him 
to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was not injured. Simi Valley won the game, 51-44. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw, who has declined to discuss the matter in detail, has been suspended 
from coaching while officials of the Simi Valley Unified School District review 
the case. His fate might be decided at a school board meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides not having a coach, the Pioneers are also without a gymnasium. Damaged 
in the Jan. 17 earthquake, it is closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley played for the first time since the shoving incident last Friday 
and defeated Camarillo, 59-49. The game was held at a continuation high school 
in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw did not attend the game, and his assistants, Steve Johnson and 
Christian Aurand, refused to coach in his place. Filling in was Brian Saunders, 
a Simi Valley lawyer who played one season in the NBA and has coached many of 
the players in youth basketball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders returned to the bench Saturday night, guiding the Pioneers to a 63-49 
victory over Newbury Park. With Bradshaw watching from the bleachers, Simi 
Valley improved to 14-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw has been Simi Valley's coach for the last six years. He won a 
Southern Section title in 1988 and his teams have reached the playoffs every 
season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Security will be heavy when Gardena Serra and Santa Monica St. Monica meet in 
a boys' basketball game on Feb. 9 at Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals of the schools have been ordered to meet during the next week in 
hopes of providing a safe environment for everyone. Tempers are still 
smoldering over a fight that broke out between the teams in a game last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With six minutes to play in the third quarter of the Camino Real League 
showdown, Ken Jackson of St. Monica and Duane Thalley of Serra fought for an 
inbounds pass. With neither player relinquishing possession, they began pushing 
and shoving each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, players and coaches from both teams and several fans rushed 
onto the court. Order was quickly restored, and Jackson and Thalley were 
ejected. After a 15-minute delay, play resumed and Serra won, 57-51. 
</P>
<P>
 During the chaos, Serra Coach Dwan Hurt hit a parent who was hitting one of 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt Hemenway, president of the Camino Real League and principal at 
Montebello Cantwell-Sacred Heart, headed a committee that reviewed the incident 
last Friday. They said videotape showed that Hurt did a good job of trying to 
restore order. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that there was no police security at the last game because the Santa 
Monica Police Department was on tactical alert after the earthquake and had no 
officers available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood Artesia's dominance in boys' basketball has come to a halt this 
season after the school had won three state titles in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the graduation of Charles O'Bannon and Avondre Jones, who are now playing 
at UCLA and USC, respectively, the Pioneers have not been the same. They are 
struggling with an 11-9 record, and their 52-48 loss to Lakewood Mayfair last 
week ended a 51-game winning streak in the Suburban League. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a major deal in our area, to win this game," Mayfair Coach Joe 
Tereschuk said. "We hadn't beaten them in six years, and the game was on local 
cable television." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monsoons held a 50-48 lead with 18 seconds left before Jason Birdwell made 
two free throws to wrap up the victory that gave them a 10-11 record.

 Girls' basketball in California is expected to have a major rule change next 
season: The midcourt stripe will be used for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, it is not a violation if the offense advances the ball to the front 
court and then returns it to the back court. The change would make the girls' 
game the same as the boys'. The girls' 30-second shot clock will remain in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule proposal will be voted on next month during the CIF State Council 
meeting. The Southern Section will support it.

 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Leodes Van Buren of Newbury Park, the state's all-time leading receiver, said 
he will sign with Colorado on national signing day Wednesday. Van Buren, 6 feet 
1 and 190 pounds, had 1,658 receiving yards and 20 touchdowns as a senior, 
4,446 yards and 44 touchdowns for his career. . . . Kicker Adam Abrams of La 
Jolla Bishop School said he would attend USC. Abrams is a consensus prep 
All-American and the most recruited kicker in the country. . . . Despite pleas 
from the Southern California Officials Assn., the Southern Section Council 
voted against a proposal to implement a 10-run mercy rule. Officials wanted the 
rule change to make their time more cost effective. Most area baseball coaches, 
however, were opposed to it. . . . Ed Zintel, formerly sports editor of the 
South Orange County News, is the new media director for the Southern Section.

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: TROJANS HAVE A FAMILIAR LOOK 
</P>

<P>
 The USC men's volleyball team has the same players, but a new attitude. And 
that has made all the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (2-0) won the UC Santa Barbara tournament last month and is ready to 
regain its traditional spot among the nation's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 With five starters back from last year's team, that doesn't seem like such a 
big deal. After all, USC went 18-12 last season, missing the NCAA final four 
for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Jim McLaughlin has been rebuilding since U.S. national team member 
Bryan Ivie finished at USC in 1991. This season, McLaughlin has everything in 
place to contend for a national title. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? The attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you believe you're good and you believe you can win the match and just 
stay united and together, you're going to be all right," McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpieces of the team are 6-foot-6 senior middle blocker Pat Ivie, 
Bryan's younger brother; 6-5 senior opposite hitter Chris Underwood and 6-7 
swing hitter Jason Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting roles are played by returning sophomore starters Russell Brock, 
a 6-3 swing hitter; and Steve Loeswick, a 6-5 setter, and freshman Eric 
Seiffert, a 6-6 middle blocker from Capistrano Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have your feelings going into every year, and this year, I feel really 
good," McLaughlin said. "The better you are, the bigger the challenge, and 
we've got a big challenge ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for USC, it can never count out its cross-town rival. 
</P>
<P>
 So sure is he that UCLA, which has won 14 NCAA titles, will repeat as national 
champion, Ted Green of Volleyball magazine wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "(It) is kind of like saying Norm Peterson is expected to order a beer when he 
walks into Cheers, except with lesser odds." 
</P>
<P>
 But after hearing everyone sing their praises, the Bruins promptly lost to BYU 
in the semifinals of the Santa Barbara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat, however, hardly worried Al Scates, who is in his 32nd year as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a few little things that we are still trying to work on," Scates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Jeff Nygaard, considered the premier middle blocker in college 
volleyball, will move to opposite hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get the ball to him more often -- he's our best hitter -- and it's 
easier to get it to him there," Scates said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the 6-8 Nygaard in the middle, the Bruins will lean on returning 
starter Tim Kelly, a 6-10 senior, and John Speraw, a 6-5 junior who played in 
only six matches last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Another change for the Bruins will be at setter, where sophomore Stein Metzger 
will replace All-American Mike Sealy, who finished his eligibility last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those changes, UCLA (4-1) is the hands-down favorite to win the 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Scates had this prediction last week before UCLA played BYU on Friday and 
Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get by (BYU) this weekend, I don't see anybody stopping us because 
we're going to be a hell of a lot better later on." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA won, 3-0, both nights. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Pepperdine men's volleyball team is not what it used to be. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At outside hitter, Tom Sorensen, the Waves' top player, has finished his 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At middle blocker, two transfers with minimal volleyball experience will be 
asked to start, hardly the norm on a team that went 55-19 the past three years 
and won the 1992 national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Many players will try to replace Sorensen, the Waves' all-time leader in 
kills. Most will fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves also are unsettled at middle blocker, where Coach Marv Dunphy will 
call upon John Bowling, a sophomore transfer from Tennessee, and Lee Bradford, 
a junior transfer from Pierce, to replace three-year starter Duane Cameron, who 
finished his eligibility last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Both will have to take big strides to make an impact at the NCAA Division I 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of teacher am I?" Dunphy recently wondered aloud. "We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Monumental" is the only way to describe the personnel losses absorbed by the 
Long Beach State men's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest hole was left by Brent Hilliard, a two-time NCAA player of the 
year and member of the 1992 bronze-medal U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard finished his eligibility last season, as did setter Jason Stimpfig 
and outside hitter Zachary Small. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, 6-7 middle blocker Matthew Suttie, the 49ers' top recruit last 
season, recently quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Coach Ray Ratelle, Suttie never met the expectations that had 
been set for him as a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just told us that he was getting tired of practicing, and he didn't have 
the desire to continue to work this hard in volleyball," Ratelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The season so far has been more than a little aggravating for Ratelle, who led 
the 49ers to a national championship in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough," Ratelle said. "I really have to remind myself to be patient, 
because I've been getting frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Four current and two former UCLA gymnasts will compete at the U.S. Olympic 
Training Center in Colorado Springs on Friday and Saturday to try to qualify 
for the U.S. Winter Cup Challenge. Sophomores Steve McCain and Jim Foody, 
junior Mike DeNucci and former Bruins Scott Keswick and Chainey Umphrey will 
try for places on the U.S. senior elite national team, while freshman Spencer 
Slaton will try to finish among the top seven juniors and earn a spot on the 
U.S junior elite national team.

VALLEY-AREA DIGEST: CONNORS' HEARING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pre-trial hearing in the case of former Hart High quarterback Ryan Connors 
was delayed Monday because his defense plans to introduce evidence that Connors 
was not legally drunk during a high-speed collision last July, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Steve Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors is charged with two felony counts (driving under the influence of 
alcohol and driving with a blood-alcohol level of .08 or above) and one 
misdemeanor count (reckless driving causing injury) in an accident on San 
Fernando Road that left another motorist seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors' defense attorneys told San Fernando Superior Court Judge Shari Silver 
they plan to show evidence that Connors' blood-alcohol content was below the 
California legal limit of .08 despite two previous readings of .08 or above. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Connors set a then-Southern Section record by passing for 4,144 yards 
in his senior season. DANA HADDAD

SOCCER / JULIE CART; MONEY IS THE ROOT OF RUSSIANS' REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The problems on the Russian national soccer team, which Coach Pavel Sadyrin 
called "normal," threaten to disrupt the team's World Cup preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadyrin dismissed the problems Saturday night in Seattle, where the United 
States tied a depleted Russian squad, 1-1. More than half of the national team 
refused to make the trip. Two months ago, 14 players met in Athens and sent a 
letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin's sports adviser demanding that 
Sadyrin be replaced by former national coach Anatoly Byshovets. 
</P>
<P>
 The mutiny involves most of the team's best players, including eight from the 
powerful club team Spartak Moscow and several from the Italian, German and 
English leagues. Even without the support of the country's top players, the 
Russian federation is fully behind Sadyrin. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach said most of the problems can be traced to club teams' refusal to 
release players for matches before the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a normal process with the Russian national team," Sadyrin said after 
Saturday's game. "Some people are not happy with something. Some don't like 
what he sees. But only the players who want to play will play on this team. In 
soccer, there are always replacements." 
</P>
<P>
 The dissident players say Sadyrin is incompetent. But the hidden agenda 
includes anger at the Russian federation over financial deals. Some players say 
they haven't received promised bonuses for qualifying for the World Cup. The 
main concern is about an official team deal -- brokered by Sadyrin -- with 
Reebok. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian players are angry that the team deal conflicts with their own 
endorsement contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Shades of the U.S. team's deal with Adidas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadyrin was not in a kiss-and-make-up mood. But if the Russians hope to get 
out of the first round in the World Cup's Group B -- with Brazil, Cameroon and 
Sweden -- all parties will have to learn to live together, if only for a short 
while.

 The report on Roy Wegerle's knee injury has gone from minor to serious, which 
might keep the England-based forward, who plays for the U.S. national team, 
sidelined for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. soccer officials learned earlier this month that Wegerle suffered a 
sprained medial collateral ligament during a match against Coventry City on 
Jan. 8. After hearing that, U.S. team trainer Rudy Rudawsky estimated Wegerle 
would miss only 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a diagnostic arthroscopy revealed a 50% tear of Wegerle's anterior 
cruciate ligament, which doctors repaired. The more serious nature of the 
injury has team officials worried, almost as much as the behavior of Coventry's 
medical team. Rudawsky has requested that Wegerle's medical reports be faxed to 
him, but there has been no response. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, U.S. officials would ask a player to return to the United States for 
rehabilitation, but in this case there is concern that such a move might offend 
Wegerle's English doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. General Manager Bill Nuttall said Coventry City must approve any travel 
for Wegerle, and the club is unlikely to allow him to return to the United 
States for treatment. Nuttall said it is possible that U.S team doctors would 
go to England to examine Wegerle's knee.  
</P>
<P>
 Wegerle expects to be playing again in mid-March.

 Major League Soccer held a bidder's conference last week in Santa Monica, 
where groups from 29 cities were briefed about the process of franchise 
approval. Bidders were told that MLS would expect each group to sell a minimum 
of 10,000 season tickets, and to have plans for the use of or construction of a 
stadium with a capacity of 20,000 to 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bids are due by May 15, and the announcement of the 12 finalists is set for 
June. The league is expected to begin play in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 General Secretary Hank Steinbrecher of the U.S. Soccer Federation said 
Saturday night that MLS, which has been sanctioned by his organization as a 
Division 1 professional soccer entity, is expected to have most of its 
financing in place by the end of April. The federation's advisory board 
monitoring the progress of MLS start-up activities will meet again next week, 
Steinbrecher said.

 Roger Milla of Cameroon, sentimental star of the 1990 World Cup, said he is 
considering a comeback with the team he currently directs. Milla, 42, added: 
"Everything depends on my form." If Milla does participate, he would be the 
oldest player ever in a World Cup. . . . Indications are that AC Milan owner 
and media magnate Silvio Berlusconi is preparing a campaign to become prime 
minister of Italy. Berlusconi has bought advertising time on television, and 
his slogan, interestingly, is identical to that of the Italian national soccer 
team. . . . Riot police fired tear gas and charged about 200 fans who went on a 
rampage outside the training camp of AS Roma last week. The fans were 
apparently angry after the team lost its sixth game of the season. . . . Terry 
Venables is expected to be named England's national coach. Venables would 
replace Graham Taylor, who resigned in November after his team failed to 
qualify for the World Cup. Concern about Venables' still-unresolved business 
dealing while running Tottenham Hotspur has reportedly prompted the English 
Football Assn. to build an escape clause into Venables's two-year deal should 
the coach be implicated in any wrongdoing.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; FRITSCHI FITS RIGHT IN WITH ANTEATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antje Fritschi loves Southern California. She came here from Germany two years 
ago and was the State singles tennis champion at Grossmont College last season. 
She loves the weather, the beaches, the tennis, everything except maybe the 
freeways. But none of that prepared her for her welcome to UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritschi returned from her home in Feiberg a few days before school started, 
rented an apartment and got a roommate, through the advertising on campus, to 
share expenses. She had scarcely met her new companion, however, when she 
returned home from a tennis workout to find yet another roomie, a rat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in from practice and this thing was running around the living room. I 
was totally freaking out," she said, showing fine command of her Southland 
English. "So I jumped up on a table. I don't handle rats too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I told my dad, he said, 'Why didn't you scoop it up with the tennis 
racket and put it back in the cage?' But I was so scared, I couldn't even get 
that close." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritschi had a little talk with her roommate about her pet's house privileges, 
but it took one more incident before it was permanently confined to its cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another time she let it out and she couldn't find it," Fritschi said. "We 
found it on my bed. Eeaagh."  
</P>
<P>
 The rat is fortunate Fritschi is so frightened of rodents. It's unlikely it 
would have survived one of her forehands. Few two-legged opponents do. Fritschi 
signed on with the Anteaters and immediately became their No. 1 singles player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antje has a powerful game and a very aggressive style," Coach Doreen Irish 
said. "She likes to get to the net and win the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritschi's tennis career began when she was 6 and her parents took up the 
sport. She played on club teams until she was 15, when she decided she would 
become a "regular teen-ager" and chase boys instead of tennis balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the age," she says. "I just wanted to be with my friends and have 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 It was about that time that Fritschi made her first trip to California, and 
she knew then she would be back. After graduating from high school in Germany, 
she took a month-long course to polish her English in preparation for college 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met some people there who were going to Grossmont, so I went, too," she 
said. "But at that time, I hadn't even thought about playing tennis. My friends 
kept saying, 'Why don't you try out for the team?' So I finally decided to try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been four or five years without any training, just playing for fun on 
weekends, so it was very hard, both physically and mentally, to play in 
tournaments again. The first couple didn't go very well, either." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fritschi, who grew up playing long rallies on clay courts, quickly 
adjusted to the fast lane of the Southland's hard courts and developed a strong 
serve-and-volley style. 
</P>
<P>
 "After about half a year, I got it back and the rest of my time at Grossmont 
was really, really fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's little chance of Jennifer Capriati Syndrome here. Fritschi's 
burning with enthusiasm, not burning out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had continued playing, I might have been saying, 'Enough tennis,' by 
now," she said, "but I had so much fun at Grossmont, I'm really excited now 
that the season has started here." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritschi is 1-1 this season -- she lost to UCLA's Keri Phebus Friday -- but 
life is good. She enjoys her classes, the weather outside is anything but 
frightful and, best of all, the rat is back in the cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could easily imagine living here," she said, "but all my family is back 
home. Now I can go back in the summer and for a month in the winter, but if I 
went to work, it would be harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I don't know. When people ask, I just say I'm keeping my options open." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a totally laid-back, California attitude, dude. 
</P>

 Spin doctor: Rod Baker seems at peace with the world these days, and that's a 
bit unusual for a basketball coach who has lost four in a row and seven of the 
last eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (5-11, 2-6 in the Big West) have lost back-to-back overtime 
games despite aggressive and intense efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot easier to put a positive spin on things when you play well and 
things just don't work out," Baker said. "We didn't play well after the first 
five minutes against (Nevada) Las Vegas and we didn't play well against San 
Jose State. Every other (conference) game was winable." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Irvine's last seven defeats were two-point margins and two went into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get blown out by 30, there's too many things to fix and guys start 
to think, 'It wasn't anything I did,' " Baker said. "But this is fixable. 
Everybody can think of one play here or there and it's a different outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came back and practiced really hard (Monday) morning. I don't think this 
is a group that will back it in, and as long as they don't quit, I have no 
reason to be discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping into the lane early on opponent free-throw attempts Thursday and 
Saturday nights hurt the Anteaters. Lane violations resulted in Long Beach 
State and UC Santa Barbara getting extra free throws. The 49ers got one point 
from the error and the Gauchos two. Both teams needed the points to send the 
games into overtime. "We never do that," Coach Rod Baker said. "You haven't 
seen us called for two lane violations in 2 1/2 years.". . . Irvine's No. 1 
doubles team of Chris Tontz and Fredrick Bach beat New Mexico's Roy Canada and 
Coulter Wright, the No. 7-ranked doubles team in the country.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: LATE STARTER NATOYA COMING ON STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Fullerton Coach Roger See talks about sophomore guard Bobby Natoya, he 
always mentions how hard Natoya works and how much determination he shows on 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Determination is the key word when it comes to understanding Natoya, 23, who 
got a late start in collegiate basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is making up for his late start. Natoya averaged 15 points last season 
and has a team-best 16-point average this season for Fullerton (20-7, 5-3 in 
conference). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ecstatic," Natoya said. "I love the coaches, the school and my teammates. 
I'm so excited to be playing. I just love being around the guys. I appreciate 
this maybe a little more than other people because of what it took for me to 
get here." 
</P>
<P>
 Natoya's twisted path to Fullerton started when he graduated from Sun Valley 
Poly High School in 1988. He then hoped to walk on at Cal State Northridge, but 
he was in a car accident that fall and couldn't play for almost two years while 
awaiting an insurance settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a fresh start, he enrolled at USC in the fall of 1990 and became 
friends with several players on the Trojan team. 
</P>
<P>
 He had hoped to walk on, but things didn't work out so he concentrated on 
classwork and played in pick-up games. He and current roommate Lorenzo Orr, a 
standout on the USC team, played together the last two summers in the Cal State 
Los Angeles summer league. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people encouraged Natoya to consider playing at the community college 
level and he contacted Tim Sweeney, an assistant now in his second year at 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Natoya was admittedly rusty for much of last season but started to feel better 
in the final weeks of the season. He was the Hornets' leading scorer in four of 
their final five games. 
</P>
<P>
 His best game came when Fullerton upset Cerritos, the second-seeded team in 
Southern California, in the opening round of the regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a team-high 25 points and made the game-winning three-pointer in the 
closing seconds of a 78-76 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," Natoya said. "Obviously it was the best win of my career. I 
told my teammates if it came down to one shot at the end that I wanted to take 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Natoya had such high expectations for this season that he pushed himself too 
hard in early-season workouts and hurt his back. He missed six games and had 
limited playing time in several others. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he is nearly at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love to compete," he said. "My dad and the rest of the family have 
supported me so much." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Game of the season: Riverside (21-5) travels to Saddleback (17-6) this week 
for the most important Orange Empire Conference game so far this season. The 
teams, tied for first in conference with 7-1 records, will play at 7 p.m. 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos, and especially guard Tes Whitlock, are playing very well. 
Whitlock scored 75 points in two games last week. Saddleback has won six in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock, a sophomore guard, averaged 32 points in his last four games and has 
an overall average of 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside features Darryle Flicking, a sophomore guard who is averaging 31 
points. The game also features two of the best point guards in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside's Raimonds Miglinieks leads the state with 12.5 assists. He is 
averaging 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Josh Borella, returning after a year off because of back surgery, 
is averaging six assists and 11 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's only conference loss was at Riverside, 91-78. 
</P>

 Helping out: The Fullerton baseball team is stepping in to provide some local 
earthquake relief this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 College of the Canyons in Valencia had several players whose homes were 
damaged in the recent earthquakes and the team wasn't sure it could play in 
this weekend's season-opening Fullerton/Cerritos tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a effort to ease traveling back and forth, Fullerton's players are 
going to take in Canyons' players for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty pumped when our kids said it would be no problem," Fullerton 
Coach Nick Fuscardo said. "We're not doing this to try and make ourselves look 
good. We just want to be there to help out anyway we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball season starts Friday with all six Orange County teams playing. 
Cypress takes on Cosumnes River at 6 p.m. in the College of the Desert 
tournament, San Bernardino Valley is at Fullerton at 10 a.m. and College of the 
Canyons plays Southwestern at 2 p.m., also at Fullerton in the opening round of 
the Fullerton/Cerritos tournament. Golden West battles Merced at 4 p.m. in the 
Fresno tournament, Orange Coast is at Citrus at 2 p.m. in the Citrus/Rio Hondo 
tournament, and East Los Angeles is at Rancho Santiago at 2 p.m. in the opening 
game of the South Bay Classic. Saddleback goes against Glendale at Palomar at 
1:30 p.m. in the first game of the Palomar tournament.

FITNESS / KATHLEEN DOHENY: ENERGY BARS DRAW EVERYDAY EXERCISERS, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Read the label on an energy bar -- those healthy snacks designed to get you 
through grueling workouts -- and you can feel almost invincible. Words such as 
performance, power and energy are plastered on the wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
 Long favored by endurance athletes (and touted by some big-name athletes), 
energy bars are also attracting everyday exercisers. That's partly due to a 
glut of new brands and strategic ads suggesting what's good for the elite might 
help the rest of us, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy bars can have a place in an exerciser's diet but can also be overkill, 
dietitians say. And there's nothing magical about them, the experts say. The 
same effect can be had with everyday foods, usually for less than the $1 to $2 
charged for most energy bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's some information to chew on before you face the smorgasbord of choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Solving the Taste Bud Problem: Palatability has been a sore point, even among 
dedicated energy-bar eaters -- who describe the taste as somewhere between 
cardboard and taffy gone bad. But that's passe, or so manufacturers claim, with 
a new emphasis on flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Formula: The common denominator for energy bars is a high-carbohydrate 
recipe that is low in fat to provide as much energy as possible. Fat intake 
should be kept to a minimum before exercise because it slows the transit time 
of food through the system, says Ellen Coleman, a Riverside dietitian and 
author of "Eating for Endurance."  
</P>
<P>
 Many energy bars get only about 8% to 10% of calories from fat, with the 
majority of calories from carbohydrates, followed by protein. Each bar is 
fortified with vitamins and minerals. The shelf life is six months or more.  
</P>
<P>
 The Market: In the past few years, several brands have debuted. Some have 
already come and gone. A sampling of what's still around: 
</P>
<P>
 * PowerBar, in four flavors. Apple-Cinnamon, for example, weighs 2.25 ounces, 
has 225 calories and two grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deer Valley McHenergy Bar, sold only by phone from Deer Valley Resort ((800) 
424-3337), weighs 2.5 ounces, has 260 calories and 1.4 grams of fat, pastry 
chef Letty Flatt says. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Clif (CQ) Bar, apricot variety, weighs 2.4 ounces, has 250 calories and 
no refined sugars, wheat or dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
 * FinHalsa weighs 1.7 ounces, has 170 calories and two grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trail Hiker, sold at ski resorts and by phone ((800) 234-7669), weighs 1.5 
ounces, has 110 calories and no fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Needs Them: Energy bars are ideal for exercisers involved in endurance 
activities, generally defined as an hour or more, Coleman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average Joe going out jogging four miles probably doesn't need these," 
adds Alicia Moag-Stahlberg, a Chicago dietitian and spokeswoman for the 
American Dietetic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The bars can come in handy, though, Coleman says, as convenient meal 
replacements if you are short of time. They can beat a fatty burger if you are 
trying to eat something before a workout.  
</P>
<P>
 When To Eat Them: Don't eat these bars too close to exercise time, or you may 
end up with less energy as your body works to digest them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's best to eat them 60 to 90 minutes before working out," says Martin 
Yadrick, a Manhattan Beach dietitian specializing in sports nutrition. "The 
more solid the bars are, and the more fiber, the longer before exercising you 
should eat them," he says. That will allow digestion to proceed so that once 
you begin exercising, blood flow can be diverted from your gut to your working 
muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman suggests one-hour eating intervals to replenish energy during an 
endurance activity. Suppose you are heading out for a three-hour bike ride? "At 
the end of the first hour, start eating a half-bar an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking water or sports drinks with the bars is highly recommended and is 
even advised on some labels to aid digestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Label Reading: Look for bars low in fat. And don't buy something that only 
looks like an energy bar. Some bars sold alongside energy bars are actually 
"nutrition bars," meant as healthier alternatives to candy bars, not 
pre-workout munchies. The fat grams are the clue: Some nutrition bars have 
seven grams of fat, but most energy bars have half that or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't buy an (energy) bar that has more than three grams of fat," 
Moag-Stahlberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatives: Other foods can help exercisers maintain energy through a 
workout and probably save money to boot, dietitians say. Good alternatives, 
Moag-Stahlberg says, are a banana, a bagel or both. Rice cakes, corn cakes or 
low-fat yogurt are other good choices, Coleman adds, along with "any food 
predominantly grain or fruit."

THEATER REVIEW; AN ENERGETIC 'SAYONARA'; THE TUNEFUL NEW MUSICAL BASED ON THE 
MICHENER BOOK HAS AN EAGERNESS TO ENTERTAIN. IT'S AT A CHEERFULLY REFURBISHED 
ALEX THEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be unfair to call "Sayonara" an old-fashioned musical. True, this is 
theway they used to write them during Broadway's Golden Age, a "book" musical 
with a bittersweet romantic story that isn't afraid to serve up a healthy 
number of laughs between the tears. What isn't old-fashioned at all in the 
current production at Glendale's newly refurbished Alex Theatre is the show's 
unabashed eagerness to entertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on James A. Michener's novel (not on the Brando film), the story is 
familiar enough. Maj. Lloyd (Ace) Gruver is stationed in occupied Japan in 1952 
and begins to find that his white-bread background is experiencing seismic 
quivers as his fellow conquering heroes discover the charms of the local women. 
</P>
<P>
 His friend Pvt. Joe Kelly is marrying his adoring Katsumi, and another pal, 
Capt. Mike Bailey, is almost as involved with Fumiko, an actress with the 
Takarazuka Theatre, where the shows are blatantly Westernized. It is Fumiko who 
introduces Gruver to the Number One Takarazuka Girl, Hana-Ogi, and sets the 
stage for the emotional turmoil that changes Gruver's life, and his heart. 
William Luce's book is about as honest as it can be in taking Michener's clues 
about the American racism in Japan at the time. Gruver's prospective 
father-in-law, the commanding officer, Gen. Webster, might be bent to sympathy 
if it weren't for the out-and-out bigotry of his wife, but his thinking is too 
close to hers, and regulations are on her side. 
</P>
<P>
 The heaviness of the plot is leavened with a tuneful score, with music by 
George Fischoff and lyrics by Hy Gilbert. If there is no memorably soaring 
ballad to hum on the way out, the romantic melodies have not only a flavor of 
the time but a sense of character and of the frustrations of the various 
star-crossed lovers. And the brightness of some of the character songs, 
particularly Kelly's exuberant "One Jump Ahead," gives the show contagious 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The present incarnation of "Sayonara" (an earlier form was seen at New 
Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse in 1987) began last year at Houston's Theatre 
Under the Stars, with the same Gruver and Hana-Ogi who give this production 
some of its best moments. Joseph Mahowald's commanding Maj. Gruver evolves 
imperceptibly from his slight starchiness at the beginning to the vulnerable 
warmth of his final moments with Hana-Ogi before they part. His rich baritone 
is perfectly matched to the gentle machismo of his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The many sides of Hana-Ogi, from Takarazuka male-impersonator to pliant but 
cautious lover, are treated like the shifting colors in a kaleidoscope in Sala 
Iwamatsu's performance -- now brash, now controlled. Director Philip Wm. 
McKinley has been with the show since its inception, and the cinematic flow of 
his staging never pauses. He knows when to bring it down to a walk, and when to 
let it run. It runs with an invigorating athleticism in the choreography by 
Tony Stevens, from jitterbugging servicemen to the Americanized revue material 
of the Takarazuka Girls, and Steven Smith's musical direction is bright and at 
times lilting. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael O'Steen is a buoyant and ingratiating Kelly, and the rough edge of 
Robert Patteri's Bailey is just right. Ako as Kelly's Katsumi and JoAnn M. 
Hunter as Bailey's Fumiko perfectly balance the energy of their G.I. Joes with 
charm and unpretentious humor. Tom Urich and Judith McCauley have the proper 
flavor of complacent bigotry as the Websters, and Frances Epsen is quietly 
elegant as their understanding daughter, whom Gruver deserts for this true 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Sherman's sets are lush when required, as are Jonathan Bixby's colorful 
costumes, and Kirk Bookman's lighting makes it all glow like musicals used to. 
The sound design of Francois Bergeron and Johnathan Deans sometimes allows the 
ensemble singing to muddle into unintelligibility and isn't too flattering to 
some of the female voices but treats the male voices with respect. 
</P>

ART REVIEW; THE '60S WERE ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ROY LICHTENSTEIN'S SOBER 
CAREER; POP WAS JUST A PROLOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roy Lichtenstein was among a number of artists who playfully put the Pop in 
Pop art between 1961 and 1965. In the process, they swept away the pale 
doldrums into which third- and fourth-generation recapitulations of Abstract 
Expressionist painting had by then so dismally fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 What's interesting about the Lichtenstein retrospective that opened Sunday at 
the Museum of Contemporary Art is that this wildly inventive moment turns out 
to have been the prologue for a wry but nonetheless surprisingly sober career 
for the now 70-year-old artist. Don't be amazed if you leave the show firm in 
the conviction that Lichtenstein started out wildly Pop but soon settled into 
becoming a latter-day Neoclassical painter. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition at MOCA is considerably smaller than it was at its debut last 
fall at New York's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The 120 paintings originally 
displayed have been whittled to 81, the 23 sculptures to 10, the 10 drawings to 
none. With certain caveats, the show is stronger for the editing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the down side, only one of the important "brush-stroke" paintings begun in 
1965 is on view at MOCA; yet, these ironic paeons to the gorgeous slathers and 
drips of Abstract Expressionism form the clearest, most succinct summation of a 
central thread of Lichtenstein's art. Meanwhile, the strangely beautiful (and 
typically underestimated) pictures of the surfaces of mirrors are not shown to 
full advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, however, relatively few of the trims in the show date to the 
remarkable five-year period when Lichtenstein began to discover his artistic 
voice by adapting modern comic-strip style to the musty cliches of Abstract 
Expressionist rhetoric. Nearly half the paintings and sculptures in the 30-year 
retrospective date from 1961 to 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 While some great examples from those fecund years are sorely missed, the 43 on 
view make for an extraordinarily compelling array. "Look Mickey" (1961), 
Lichtenstein's first all-cartoon canvas, begins the survey with a pointed 
fusillade. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting uses its blunt, red-yellow-blue primaries to fashion a slyly 
hilarious riff on artistic solipsism. As Mickey Mouse looks on with bemusement, 
a typically wild-eyed Donald Duck raves hysterically about the giant fish he 
thinks he's caught on the other end of his tugging fish line. All the while, 
Donald is completely unaware that the whopper is in fact inside his own 
coattail, which he's neatly hooked behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 The reigning Expressionist faith in a self that can know only its own 
experiences, its own states of being, is given the boot in this surgically 
incisive image. The "big, American themes" grandly associated in the 1950s with 
the muscular, aggressive expanses of Abstract Expressionist painting here come 
apart at the seams, while the bigger, even more American theme of popular 
culture takes center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstraction, then acclaimed as the peak of a long, Modernist road to artistic 
heights, gives way to vintage Disney and the Sunday funnies. In a famous 
magazine article, the volatile Abstract Expressionist painters had been dubbed 
"The Irascibles," and who in the pop culture pantheon is more irascible than 
Donald Duck? 
</P>
<P>
 In the lexicon of traditional art, a cartoon is a spontaneous, preparatory 
study for a sleekly finished painting. It was the crudeness of such cartoons to 
which Impressionist canvases had been derisively compared nearly a century 
before, when a modern sensibility erupted. Lichtenstein, a mature 38 in 1961, 
was again restoring a sense of urgency to a contemporary artistic milieu gone 
stale and wan. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, Mickey! The usual claims for a primacy of feeling being more truly 
recorded in abstract rather than figurative art have gotten deliciously 
upended! 
</P>
<P>
 Like Andy Warhol, Lichtenstein surveyed the tired, restrictive and overworked 
terrain of American avant-garde art in his risible Pop paintings of the early 
'60s. In "Drowning Girl," a brunette goes under for the count, swirling in an 
abstract tidal-pool of paint. De Kooning's notorious pictures of women become 
comic-strip blonds, overcome with existential anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Painting as autobiography is shown as an unexpressive list of jottings in an 
ordinary appointment book. Elsewhere, the cover to a high school composition 
book recalls Pollock's dark, jagged gestures in black automobile paint. 
</P>
<P>
 In dazzling war-comic images of fighter planes, the battle over abstraction's 
stranglehold on contemporary art is addressed. "Okay, hot-shot, okay! I'm 
pouring!" screams a fighter pilot in a burst of machine-gun fire, wittily 
mowing down critic Clement Greenberg's contemporaneous dissertations, which 
promoted the so-called "poured abstractions" of Morris Louis and Helen 
Frankenthaler. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, once the battle was won and Pop art stood triumphant, 
Lichtenstein couldn't keep fighting a vanquished foe. His art wobbles a bit, 
especially in big, 1968 canvases based on Art Deco designs of the 1920s and 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Their significance lies primarily in focusing on the most popular American 
artistic style when mass culture was being born -- a style that lives on 
nostalgically today. Audience taste is their subject, while the relationship 
between audience and art is incisively (and melancholically) considered in 
Lichtenstein's next major body of work. 
</P>
<P>
 The mirror paintings (1969-71) apply mass-graphic style to effectively 
represent the shiny, silvered surfaces of variously shaped looking glasses. 
Their most disorienting quality is the utter absence of a reflected image. Like 
Dracula, you stand full-bodied before these Pop mirrors, yet you cannot see 
your apparently deadened, bloodless self. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and continuing to the present, Lichtenstein 
widened his scope from the urgent, Abstract Expressionist focus of his early 
work. All of Modern painting has since become grist for his image mill: 
Impressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, Surrealism -- these and more 
are quoted. 
</P>
<P>
 So is architecture, specifically the entablatures supported by columns on 
classical buildings. Lichtenstein's are pointedly Neoclassical, however, and 
therein lies a key to his post-Pop art. For just as Neoclassical artists of any 
revolutionary age -- including powerful moments in the 11th, 15th, 17th and 
19th centuries -- have built their work on classical foundations, so does he. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is that, for Lichtenstein, it is the classics of Modernism, not 
of antiquity, that are the columns holding up the entablature of his art. (In 
1988 he made a failed attempt to paint the Laocoon, the famous Roman copy of a 
1st-Century Greek sculpture beloved of the Renaissance; fortunately, it's not 
in the show.) Since at least 1972, his own "classic Pop" works of the '60s have 
also turned up as sources, represented within new paintings much the way 
Matisse showed his own paintings in the backgrounds of new work. 
</P>
<P>
 In moments of great upheaval, such as our own, Neoclassicism means to suggest 
a stable continuity with the past. By also showing how far we've come since 
then, the unique importance of the present is punctuated. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, when the distant mists of antiquity are replaced by the pressing 
realities of the modern world, as Lichtenstein has done, something else 
intrudes. A sobering sense that perhaps we haven't come so very far at all 
reverberates through this beautifully skeptical show.

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW; BIG FOR ITS AGE; TEEN SHADINGS ARE ADDED TO 'HOW TO 
EAT LIKE A CHILD,' BUT THERE ARE LAUGHS FOR LITTLE KIDS TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's evening. The house is quiet. The phone rings. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have children, you know what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't, here's a clue: Pandemonium. The baby shrieks, the 6-year-old 
pitches himself from the top bunk and the teen-agers, at the exact instant, 
experience raging hunger pangs and reach for the last Twinkie. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shouting reaches the next area code, you begin to ask yourself the 
eternal question: What is it that enables children who can't even agree on a 
television program to mount such a flawlessly synchronized attack without 
exchanging so much as a wink? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is simple. It's all in the handbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Delia Ephron's "How to Eat Like a Child" is about as close to that handbook as 
most adults will ever get. Ephron's book has been adapted into a series of 
comic musical sketches, currently being staged by the Depot Theatre Young 
Actor's Company. At last Sunday's performance at the Depot Theatre, the show 
drew a steady stream of yuks from kids and an equal number of wry (or were 
those pained?) chuckles from adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute show, directed by Jack Millis, features sketches with such 
titles as "How to Play" and "How to Act After Being Sent to Your Room." The 
script by Ephron, John Forster and Judith Kahan seems to draw most of its 
inspiration from the grade-school set. So, it took some time to adjust to the 
ages of many of the cast members (the range was from 10- to 19-year-olds, but 
the majority looked to be from the mid- and upper end of that). 
</P>
<P>
 Millis has attempted to incorporate that by adding some teen-age shadings to 
the vignettes. A primer on how to eat mashed potatoes was framed in a "Wayne's 
World"-style talk show hosted by a totally tubular pair, and in a scene 
entitled "How to Practice the Violin," the unwilling student fantasized about a 
12-string Rickenbackers and Pearl Jam (" That's music"). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, these and other attempts to raise the hipness level of the 
show worked well. Some didn't. The beatnik-ish "How to Express an Opinion" fell 
flat, as did a segment on lunchroom presented a la "The Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Other sketches that borrowed from popular genres with greater success included 
"How to Beg for a Dog," which features a vaudeville song and dance complete 
with straw skimmers and some of Forster's wittiest lyrics, and "How to 
Understand Parents," which gave basic translations of adult conversation 
(everything means "No") in a "Les Miserables"-style musical setting. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scenes that were probably the most enjoyable were the ones that more 
or less played it straight, pandering neither to the kids nor the adults. 
Topping that list was "How to Behave in School" (prop Mad magazine inside 
Language Arts book, laugh hysterically. When teacher notices, mumble 
appreciatively, "Oh, that Tolstoy!") 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every member of the "How to Eat" cast has put in some time on the 
boards, and it shows. Strengths varied: Some cast members were better singers 
than actors, others the opposite. A few, such as Joe Alfred Lopez Jr. and Clark 
Damico -- the pair featured in "How to Beg for a Dog" -- were noteworthy in 
both arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Anne Brennan and Josh Shade played off each other nicely in several 
sketches as sparring siblings. Summer Wybaczynskeythe proud owner of one of the 
most malleable faces since Soupy Sales as well as a fairly impressive set of 
pipes, was a hoot as she asked the musical question, "Why Should a Kid Have to 
Walk?" 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows, kiddo? Better check the handbook.

 Spanish Opera House Burns: Fire destroyed Spain's leading opera house, the 
146-year-old Gran Teatre del Liceu, on Monday. The cause of the blaze on 
Barcelona's picturesque Ramblas Boulevard had not been determined. It broke out 
shortly after 11 a.m. behind the theater's stage and within an hour had spread 
through the building, causing much of the roof to collapse. Jordi Pujol, head 
of the Catalonia regional government, said the theater would be rebuilt 
immediately. The city and regional government had been planning to begin a 
$28-million, two-year restoration of the theater later this year.

 * 'Tommy' to Play Universal: The touring production of "The Who's Tommy" will 
play the Universal Amphitheatre for at least three weeks beginning July 13. 
Acoustic walls will narrow the sides of the seating area, reducing capacity 
from 6,251 to 3,801 in an attempt to improve sight-lines, and the stage will be 
extended backward to create space for the show's elaborate set and projection 
equipment. Although the show has been announced as playing only through July 
31, a three-week extension is possible. As previously announced, the tour also 
is slated for the McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert April 28-May 1 and the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center May 10-15. COMEDY

 * Casting Call: 20th Century Fox is looking for the next Natalie Wood. Fox, 
along with writer-producer John Hughes, will hold a seven-city open casting 
call on Saturday to find a 6-year-old star for the studio's remake of the 1947 
holiday classic "Miracle on 34th Street." "We're considering both boys and 
girls to portray the character . . . and we're opening the auditions up to kids 
with or without acting experience," said Hughes. "What we'll be hoping to find 
is that magical quality of humor and innocence that helped to make the original 
'Miracle on 34th Street' a classic." Hopeful stage mothers will have to take 
their wards to Houston, Dallas, Seattle, New York, Chicago, Orlando or 
Minneapolis for an audition -- no open casting call is scheduled for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casting Call, Part II: An open casting call will be held at Melrose Avenue's 
Raleigh Studios Wednesday for "9021-Zero -- The Movie," a film parody of the 
Fox TV series "Beverly Hills, 90210." The Tomorrow's Girl project, which is 
scheduled to start production in April, follows the publicity surrounding the 
lives of Duke Cherry, Jace Popely, Torny Reading, Wennie Girth, Byron Justin 
Chartreuse, Lian Hering and Giselle Cataract as they react to their volatile 
co-star, Dannen Doberman. Look-alikes of the TV stars are requested. QUICK

 Jill Clayburgh and James Farentino will play parents Kitty and Jose, and Billy 
Warlock and David Beron will portray brothers Lyle and Erik in "Honor Thy 
Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders," a TV film based on 
the real-life story, which is now in production for Fox. . . . Edward Asner 
will return to TV later this season in the new ABC series "Thunder Alley." He 
plays a retired stock-car driver whose life is turned around when his divorced 
daughter returns home with her three young children. . . . The J. Paul Getty 
Museum is selling "Cloud, Mexico," a 1926 photograph by Edward Weston, in an 
April photography auction at Christie's New York. The platinum print, valued at 
$80,000 to $100,000, is nearly identical to another Weston in the museum's vast 
collection of photographs. Proceeds from the sale will go to the Getty's 
acquisitions fund. SHAUNA SNOW

THEATER REVIEW; POIGNANCY OF PARENTAL LOVE SUMS UP 'THE SUM'; NORTH COAST 
REPERTORY PRESENTS WITH SENSITIVITY AND STYLE THE STORY OF A MAN HELPING HIS 
SON FIND MR. RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 North Coast Repertory Theatre, which was staging such works as "Torch Song 
Trilogy" and "The Normal Heart" when gay themes still took patrons by surprise, 
is offering "The Sum of Us," a 1991 Obie-winner by David Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 In this simple, tender and often witty drama about a widowed Australian and 
his gay son, the conflict is not about sexuality, and no one gets AIDS. What 
drives the story is the father's determination that Jeff be happy, and if that 
means helping him find a "cheerful" mate (Dad dislikes the word "gay"), Dad 
will do whatever it takes -- from cruising gay bars with Jeff to bringing home 
gay magazines to serving Jeff's overnight guests tea in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Which really freaks out the overnight guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sum of Us" is not a major play with great implications. Its significance 
derives from the very ordinariness of its skillfully written characters. The 
gay son is not brilliant, rich, famous or wildly charismatic. He's a plumber 
whose big dream is that the nice young gardener he meets in a pub will turn out 
to be Mr. Right. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosina Widdowson-Reynolds directs with sensitivity and style, eliciting a 
particularly lovely and fluid performance as Jeff from newcomer Kevin Patrick 
Walls, whose quiet agony as a nice but lonely, less-than-forceful guy touches 
the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Rose sets down a solid anchor as Harry, the unwaveringly supportive if 
slightly smothering father, though he clearly is better portraying extremes of 
love and exasperation than finer shades of feeling. In more simply drawn roles, 
J.D. Meier makes a credibly confused Greg, Jeff's unsure gardener, and Wendy 
Cullum is appropriately stiff and repressed as Joyce, a woman Harry woos only 
to find that she can't accept his son's homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The design details, from Marty Burnett's unfussy working class set to the 
costumes by Sue Schaffner and Widdowson-Reynolds, fit the piece snugly without 
adding or taking away very much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the play is small in scope, more could be plumbed from it. Stevens 
writes segments during which his characters talk to the audience; these could 
be more cleanly demarcated. And there is a sub-story about the father's mother, 
who took a female lover after her husband died; this floats a suggestion -- not 
fully nailed down in this production -- that the father feels guilty about 
having separated his mother from her true love, a mistake he doesn't want to 
repeat with his son. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are minor flaws in a show that overall is a pleasurably funny, 
poignant look at real life in the '90s -- at once true to its gay subject 
matter and to the universal issue of parental love, its grand possibilities and 
its often painful limitations.

MUSIC REVIEW; A GLORIOUS STERN RECITAL

<P>
 At 73, Isaac Stern might be forgiven for packing it in and resting on his 
laurels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might even encourage him to do so. The faults in his playing are obvious. 
His tone is small, wiry, and, occasionally, whiny. His intonation is sometimes 
off, at times considerably. His fingers do not move as easily as they once did. 
Violinists, unlike pianists, cannot go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every fault on display, there were 100 things he did right. That still 
puts him considerably ahead of most of his younger colleagues. His recital 
Sunday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, with pianist Yefim Bronfman in 
partnership, was, in a word, glorious. In four words, elegant, probing, 
communicative and wise. 
</P>
<P>
 One would guess that Stern hears what we hear. He knows his technique has 
faded. He knows his limitations -- and he works with them, not against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Mozart sonatas, K. 377 in F and K. 481 in E-flat, opened the concert. 
Stern presented them within a tiny framework of sound, avoiding pressing his 
tone beyond its limits, relying on lightness of touch. The details within that 
framework, however, were many and pointed. 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed to weigh every phrase thoughtfully -- gently shading and emphasizing 
curves, varying articulation -- and then place them in the overall context with 
the skill of a philosopher. The two slow movements emerged in all of their 
emotional scope, and he made his points by pulling back, by bringing the 
listener to him. 
</P>
<P>
 He lightly sketched in the charms of Schubert's G-minor Sonatina as well, 
finding, in the process, what seemed the perfect tempos for the composer's 
tuneful thoughts to breathe and glow. Bronfman, with the piano lid fully open, 
never overpowered the violinist's slender tone and yet projected an array of 
color, touch and feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have appeared, however, that Cesar Franck's demanding, richly 
perfumed and grandly rhetorical Sonata in A would be too much for Stern's 
fragile technique. But, again, he did the smart thing by not asking himself to 
do what he couldn't, and by capturing the breadth of phrase and heated impulses 
with urgent, supple restraint. In doing so, with Bronfman offering a rich 
backdrop for the violinist to work in, he revealed how simple the beauties of 
this work really are. 
</P>
<P>
 The faults? Mere technicalities.

TV REVIEW; THE DIAMOND EXPOSE AS BIG AS THE RITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>

 Crucially scheduled to air two weeks before Valentine's Day -- and just in 
time for all those thinking of buying their loved one a precious stone -- 
"Frontline's" startling report, "The Diamond Empire" (at 9 tonight on KCET-TV 
Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15; 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24) should be a 
red flag for the potential diamond consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those who've already thrown down hard-earned cash for what may be the 
world's most overpriced commodity, prepare to get very angry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Diamonds, according to the report and seconded by several investigative 
journalists such as Edward Jay Epstein, are not only not rare, they are common 
minerals in regions of at least three continents. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been marketed as rare, priced as such and controlled by one of 
history's most successful monopoly cartels: De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Diamond Empire" describes what is essentially the last of the 
robber-baron operations, buying up competitors, swaying governments, even 
allegedly using terror tactics to ensure a lock on the diamond industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The players here range from the Oppenheimer family of South Africa, which 
controls De Beers, and Rhodesia founder Cecil Rhodes, to Hitler, Marilyn 
("Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend") Monroe and, above all, a consuming public 
that has been duped for years to believe that diamonds are so precious that 
they are worth the cost. One dealer, for example, displays a $90 ring that 
contains a diamond actually worth $1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein suggests that the long-held monopoly, which even extended during the 
Cold War to the Soviet Union's huge diamond supply, may be near an end if the 
U.S. government goes after De Beers the way it went after Panamanian Gen. 
Manuel Noriega. Like Noriega's illegal drug business, De Beers could be 
prosecuted here for violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.  
</P>
<P>
 Even more ominously for a company so powerful that it can dictate policy in 
some African regimes, Russia's need for hard currency could force it to flood 
the world market with its diamonds. It might kill the cartel, and the marketing 
myth. That is, if "Frontline" doesn't do it first.

 IN THE DARK: Most of our schools are open. Most of our sanity has returned. 
But many of us still don't know how much, if any, assistance we'll receive from 
insurance companies.Some also resent the attention being shown to poorer 
victims at tent cities and shelters. "My block wall is down," said one 
disgruntled resident. "I've got cracks everywhere. . . . What about me?" See 
Valley Business, Page 3. 
</P>
<P>
 BAD NUMBERS: The estimates are beginning to pour in at Cal State Northridge, 
and they aren't pretty. Officials said Monday that losses resulting from quake 
damage could total $250 million to $350 million. That would be much higher than 
anticipated, and could be one of the largest losses for any area public 
institution (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 TAKING ADVANTAGE: One mall's bust is another mall's bonanza. The closing of 
the Northridge Fashion Center poses a tremendous business opportunity to other 
Valley shopping centers. . . . Peggy Chopin (above) of West Hills leaves the 
Target in Woodland Hills after picking up much-needed supplies. See Valley 
Business, Page 4. 
</P>
<P>
 TAX HEADACHES: Post-quake foreclosure is certainly a difficult step, but it 
may be even trickier to figure out how it affects your taxes. You may be 
eligible for a variety of tax breaks, but it will take an accountant to figure 
it out. Call the Internal Revenue Service to get an early start on the 
complicated procedure. See Valley Business, Page 12.

 MICHIGAN STATE BOUND: Tyrone Crenshaw, two-time City Section 4-A Division 
player of the year from Sylmar High, will remain a Spartan. . . . The Sylmar 
Spartan running back has orally committed to play football for the Michigan 
State Spartans. Crenshaw rushed for 1,785 yards as a senior, 1,875 as a junior, 
topping all City rushers both years (C7).

 BO'S SKY: Bo Jackson, the newest member of the California Angels (C1), 
apparently has found a new hobby. He already has conquered football, winning 
the Heisman Trophy at Auburn before becoming an All-Pro running back for the 
Raiders. He has mastered baseball, making the All-Star team in 1989. And now? . 
. . "I'd still like to be a military pilot," Jackson confided. "In fact, I'm 
going to go up with the Blue Angels in three days. I'm going up in that 
beautiful blue sky. Believe me, that's living." 
</P>
<P>
 BO'S HOUSE? Jackson already knows how to hit home runs at Anaheim Stadium. It 
was his first-inning homer at the Big A in the 1989 All-Star game there that 
made him the game's most valuable player and elevated his endorsement dollars. 
That was all before his artificial hip operation, but Jackson exudes 
confidence: "The ball travels very well in this ballpark. I like that. Whenever 
I'm in the lineup, I'll try to make things happen."

 HOME REMINDER: Costa Mesa photographer Pascal Tran, 32, recently took his 
cameras back to Vietnam, his first return since moving here as a teen-ager. He 
took 4,000 pictures, which he's turned into a slide show aimed at other 
Vietnamese Americans. It will be shown repeatedly during the 12th annual Tet 
Festival at Golden West College in Huntington Beach this weekend. . . . "Many 
of us don't remember Vietnam because we are so young," Tran says. "I just want 
to remind them what our country is like."

 FAMILY SUPPORT: Three men accused of killing Amy Biehl of Newport Beach when 
she was working in South Africa last August saw two unexpected faces at their 
trial in Cape Town on Monday: Amy's sister Molly, and her mother, Linda Biehl. 
. . . The two decided to attend after reading that some witnesses were being 
intimidated. Says Linda Biehl: "We are Amy's family, and if it had happened in 
the U.S., we would have been at the trial. It may help us get through this."

WITNESSES SAY BECKWITH BRAGGED OF KILLING EVERS; COURT: SUSPECT ON TRIAL FOR 
THE THIRD TIME IN THE 1963 SLAYING PURPORTEDLY REFERRED TO THE BLACK CIVIL 
RIGHTS LEADER AS A 'CHICKEN-STEALING DOG.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Byron De La Beckwith bragged on two occasions that he had killed civil rights 
leader Medgar Evers, whom he called a "chicken-stealing dog," witnesses at his 
murder trial testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a man he killed, it was a damn chicken-stealing dog, and you know 
what you have to do to a dog after he's tasted blood," Mary Ann Adams said 
Beckwith told her in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Prince, who rented an apartment from Beckwith in Tennessee in 1986 and 
1987, said Beckwith used a racial slur when referring to Evers and the trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I had a job to do and I did it, and I didn't suffer any more than 
your wife if she was going to have a baby,' " Prince told the jury in Hinds 
County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith was tried twice in 1964 for the murder of Evers, who headed the 
Mississippi NAACP from 1954 until his slaying on June 12, 1963. Both trials 
ended in hung juries. 
</P>
<P>
 New evidence enabled prosecutors to reopen the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, a bookkeeper, said Beckwith was introduced to her as Evers' killer when 
she and a co-worker ran into him at a restaurant in Greenwood in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was introduced to him as 'Byron De La Beckwith, the man who killed Medgar 
Evers,' " she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refused to shake his hand, said I wouldn't shake the hand of a murderer. He 
got extremely agitated." 
</P>
<P>
 That was when he made the remark about killing a dog, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams admitted that she hadn't told authorities about the remark for 14 years. 
She said she had assumed that Beckwith couldn't be tried again. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys tried to undermine Prince's testimony by revealing that he 
had been evicted from Beckwith's rental apartment. The reason for the eviction 
wasn't disclosed, however.

SCOTT HARRIS: ORDEAL PUT THE PEDAL TO FAMILY'S METTLEBOB'S BREATHING BECAME SO

HOUR, CHRIS USED THE "AMBU BAG" TO KEEP HIS FATHER ALIVE.

 "This time," Judy Horn said, "our dogs alerted us." 
</P>
<P>
 Holly, usually a picture of calm, grew nervous. After the 3.8 aftershock hit 
early Saturday morning, the black Lab forced her way into Judy's room. Soon 
Judy was up feeding biscuits to Holly, Rex and the chronically skittish Butch. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Judy decided to check on her ailing husband. She was at Bob's side when 
the 5.0 aftershock hit at 3:20 a.m., centered just a few miles north of their 
Winnetka home. 
</P>
<P>
 With one hand, Judy held on to Bob. With the other, she held on to his 
mechanical lung. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's been two weeks and a day since the 6.6 haymaker sent us reeling. True, we 
don't know when the aftershocks will end. But as I took my own secret shortcut 
to work Monday, it was good to see that some of the fallen block walls were 
being rebuilt. Slowly, life seems to be returning to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 This also seems true for the Horn family -- and normal for them is 
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers may recall Bob and Judy Horn. Bob is a former Cal State Northridge 
political science professor who five years ago was stricken with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS). Now virtually paralyzed by the disease, Horn survives 
with the aid of a ventilator -- a battery-powered box that feeds air to his 
windpipe through a plastic tube. Although his body has failed him, Prof. Horn 
still displays a sharp mind and an active wit with the help of a specially 
rigged computer or the coded movements of his eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Jan. 17 quake was frightening for you, imagine what it was like for the 
immobile Bob Horn, whose mechanical lung was pitched to the floor and damaged. 
Imagine what it was like for Judy as she heard the ventilator alarm, signaling 
that Bob wasn't getting any air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I had time to go into the apprehension and fear," Judy says, 
"because I had so much to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy and Bob, fortunately, weren't alone. Their 22-year-old son, Chris, was at 
home, as was a nursing attendant. So was Judy's 77-year-old mother, Marion, 
who'd shuffled in from the cold of Buffalo, N. Y., for a visit, only to come 
down with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 The others made it through the quake without harm. They focused their 
attention on Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 First they disconnected Bob's broken "vent" and hooked up a device known as an 
"ambu bag" -- a manually operated device that pumps air into his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't the only concern. Earlier that week, Bob had developed a bronchial 
infection that required the suctioning of fluids from his throat. With the 
power knocked out by the earthquake, they resorted to a portable, 
battery-powered suction device that provided only minimal help. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob's breathing became so difficult that Judy hooked up the device to an 
oxygen tank. For close to an hour, Chris used the "ambu bag" to keep his father 
alive. Judy dug through the books and memorabilia that had fallen in the den to 
retrieve Bob's wheelchair, with the portable ventilator attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris tried to explain his father's ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's helpless all the time," Chris said. "And when you run into something 
like an earthquake, when people who are not sick are helpless, it magnifies his 
helpless feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared. My mom was scared. But that has to be shoved aside to make sure 
he gets through it. . . . It was amazing what my mom was able to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends pitched in as well. A neighbor shut off the gas line. Mario Hernandez, 
a nursing assistant who has been with the Horns for three years, left his own 
damaged apartment in Reseda to check on the Horns. Chris' friend Ben Turner 
also showed up. Together, Chris and Ben were able to lift Bob into his 
wheelchair and place him in the van for a trip to the hospital, Humana West 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Horn has nothing but praise for how the hospital's doctors, nurses and 
attendants reacted to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bob in the hospital, the Horns turned to chores at home. Broken pipes had 
flooded part of the house. A block wall was down in the back yard. Like so many 
people in the Valley, they were living without power, gas and water service. 
"We're really, really lucky," Chris said. "There are people a lot worse off 
than we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy's mother, who had always said she hoped to experience an earthquake on a 
California visit, headed home with a heck of a story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, 11 days after the 6.6 quake hit, Bob came home from the hospital 
-- just in time for a big aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy says they've learned a few lessons. Now Bob's ventilator is strapped to 
the table by a bungee cord. And his portable ventilator is close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Horn tends to focus on the silver linings. One of the nice things about 
the Northridge earthquake, she says, is that old friends from all over the 
world have checked in to see how they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, these calls have a certain poignancy. The other day, the Horns 
received a call from one of Bob's old frat brothers. They'd been out of touch 
for such a long time that he wasn't aware of Bob's illness. 
</P>
<P>
 But this friend, and all the others, would be happy to know that Bob's wit 
survived the quake just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking with eyebrows, Bob says there is only one reason he went to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't deal with the cleanup." 
</P>

GIVING UP THE SHIP; CHEVRON'S LOCAL TANKER BUSINESS HALTED BY A MISSED DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Chevron Corp., which fought a decade-long battle to ship oil by tanker through 
the Santa Barbara Channel, will cease shipping operations today after failing 
to secure a deal with a pipeline company to move oil after its shipping permit 
expires in 1996, according to public and company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its California Coastal Commission permit, Chevron had until today to 
line up a permanent pipeline to move the crude being pumped from its massive 
Point Arguello offshore fields to refineries in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such an agreement in place, the company must cease shipping operations 
immediately, state and local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Chevron has applied for an emergency permit to continue using 
tankers because the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged a portion of a pipeline used to 
transport about half of the crude produced at the company's Point Arguello 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company normally moves about 40,000 barrels of oil a day on that Four 
Corners pipeline, which runs from northern Santa Barbara County to Bakersfield 
and then on to Los Angeles refineries. With the damage, Chevron has been forced 
to reroute the oil, slow production and place excess crude oil in storage 
tanks, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron's failure to sign a pipeline agreement also threatens its right to use 
the marine terminal at Gaviota for loading tankers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State Lands Commission officials said Monday that its lease agreement with 
Chevron for use of the offshore terminal was also contingent upon the company 
finalizing a pipeline agreement by today. 
</P>
<P>
 "After midnight tonight, Chevron must stop tankering," Jim Trout, assistant 
executive officer of the State Lands Commission, said Monday. "So far, we have 
not officially heard from the company. And at this point, it would be very hard 
for this agency to justify this situation as an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron spokesman G. Michael Marcy said the company was unsuccessful in its 
efforts to reach a deal with Huntington Beach-based Cajon Pipeline Co., which 
will soon start construction of a pipeline from the Barstow area to Los 
Angeles. Negotiations with the company broke off in late December. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy said Chevron backed out of the deal because the two companies could not 
agree to terms and the oil company did not like the route of the proposed 
pipeline. Chevron officials instead have opted to pursue development of the 
Pacific Pipeline, an oil conduit that is proposed to run directly south from 
Kern County to the company's Los Angeles-area refineries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cajon pipeline is not as commercially viable as we would like," Marcy 
said. "We had high hopes that we would reach a deal, but in the end could not 
agree. That's business. We're not going to be pushed into a deal just because 
(Cajon officials) may have their construction permits in hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday morning, the Chevron tanker Oregon eased away from its moorings 
at Gaviota loaded with an estimated 250,000 barrels of oil and headed south 
toward Los Angeles. It could be the company's last tanker load unless Santa 
Barbara County officials approve the company's request for an emergency 
shipping permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's voyage was Chevron's 17th since getting the permit in January, 1993, 
from the Coastal Commission following a bruising 10-year battle with county and 
state regulators and local environmentalists. Chevron and its partners have 
sunk an estimated $2.6 billion into the Point Arguello project. The offshore 
field contains an estimated 300 million to 600 million barrels of oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to accept our bitter medicine on this one," Marcy said. "Obviously, 
we are not going to meet our deadline and tankering operations will cease 
effective Feb. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Douros, deputy director of the energy division for Santa Barbara County, 
said county officials are considering Chevron's emergency shipping request. He 
said a decision may be reached as early as Wednesday. Chevron asked the county 
to allow it to use tankers to ship up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day until the 
Four Corners pipeline is repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking over their request and considering whether or not an emergency 
truly exists," Douros said. "We want to determine the exact extent of the 
damages to the line and find out when it is expected to be back on line." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also investigating Chevron and its corporate partners' ability 
to store oil until the Four Corners pipeline resumes operation. The companies 
involved in the Point Arguello project now can store about 800,000 barrels of 
crude. About 80,000 barrels a day is produced from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda Krop, an attorney with the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense 
Center, said Chevron's request for an emergency shipping permit and the 
company's inability to secure a deal with a pipeline company were examples of 
its intent to continue to rely upon tanker shipping instead of pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our belief that Chevron never intended to use the Cajon line and in fact 
hoped to use a failed deal with them as a reason for the Coastal Commission to 
grant an extension on their tankering permit," Krop said. "We hope that when 
officials examine the situation, Chevron's plans will backfire." 
</P>
<P>
 Krop discounted Chevron's suggestion that the Four Corners pipeline system was 
so seriously damaged as to prevent Chevron's use. Even if the pipeline is 
inoperative, Chevron's own oil storage units and the temporary use of other 
pipelines could be substituted until repairs on the Four Corners lines are 
completed, she said.

NEW METROLINK STATION WILL OPEN FEB. 14 IN CAMARILLO; TRANSPORTATION: METROLINK 
SITE WOULD PROVIDE 2 ROUND-TRIPS DAILY, EASING POST-EARTHQUAKE COMMUTING. THE 
DEBATE CONTINUES OVER ITS FINANCING, HOWEVER.

<P>
 A Metrolink station that would provide bare-bones service from Camarillo to 
Los Angeles is scheduled to open in two weeks, helping to ease post-earthquake 
commutes, transportation officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Metrolink and the Ventura County Transportation Commission 
pledged to start the service on Feb. 14 with two round-trip trains per day, 
despite growing confusion about how construction and operation of the station 
will be financed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, officials announced plans to extend Metrolink to 
Camarillo, intending to fund the year-long extension exclusively with up to 
$900,000 in disaster relief funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials from Metrolink and the Transportation Commission spent most of 
last week haggling over a range of station plans, with local officials favoring 
the scrappy slab of asphalt with a dirt parking lot originally discussed and 
Metrolink officials proposing a sleek, multimillion-dollar facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Those discussions are continuing, but officials said several options will be 
presented to the Transportation Commission at its 10:30 a.m. Friday meeting at 
Camarillo City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Commissioner Bill Davis said he still favors the original, 
bare-bones proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't need right now is a state-of-the-art station with a slew of new 
engines and cars," he said. "What we do need is to get some emergency service 
up and running as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The no-frills station envisioned by Davis and other officials would include a 
lighted platform and parking lot for 240 cars. It would lack the automated 
ticket machines, benches and awnings found at the Simi Valley and Moorpark 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 And under that option, Camarillo would have only two trains heading to Los 
Angeles in the morning and two returning at night. Officials originally had 
envisioned five round-trip trains per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a stripped-down station and two trains daily, the Transportation 
Commission will probably have to pay some of the costs of serving Camarillo, 
officials now say. The commission gets its money from state transportation 
funds and county subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the transportation commissioners on Monday, commission Executive 
Director Ginger Gherardi said the agency should be willing to pay "our share of 
the costs" -- up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials said they are confident that FEMA will pay as much as 
$900,000 to extend the service. But Gherardi said in her memo that if the 
agency turns down the county's application, the commission will be liable for 
the full cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials said that although they have proposed a range of station 
possibilities, they are willing to build whatever Ventura County wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink Regional Coordinator Adrienne Brooks-Taylor said the estimated cost 
for extending service to Camarillo could run as high as $2.5 million, depending 
on the type of station. But by cutting corners, costs could be reduced 
dramatically, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the commission decides to spend only $900,000, "we will go ahead with 
plans for the station in Camarillo," Brooks-Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Metrolink has opened four emergency stations in the Antelope Valley 
and one in the San Fernando Valley since the quake, no estimates are available 
on the cost of those stations, Brooks-Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working so fast, pulling everything together on an emergency 
basis, that we're just now breaking down the cost."

LARGE HOTEL-CASINO PROPOSED FOR OXNARD; GAMING: RETIRED CAMARILLO BUSINESSMAN 
WANTS TO OFFER GAMBLING AT REGIONAL CONVENTION CENTER. BUT CITY COUNCIL 
REJECTED A CARD HOUSE PLAN LAST YEAR, AND KEY OFFICIALS ARE STILL OPPOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven months after the City Council derailed plans to open a major card house, 
a former union organizer and restaurateur is floating a proposal for a regional 
hotel-casino before Oxnard officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Bokron, a 71-year-old retired businessman living in Camarillo, said 
Monday that he is putting together plans to bring big-dollar gambling to Oxnard 
in the form of a sprawling hotel-convention center casino that he said could 
come before the City Council as soon as this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting the plan by the Oxnard City Council or residents will not be easy. 
Several key city and county officials said Monday they still oppose large-scale 
gambling and the criminal element that often accompanies it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city received about 2,000 letters specifically opposed to card 
casinos -- outnumbering those who favored the proposal 20 to 1, according to 
the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public doesn't want a card club in Oxnard," Councilman Michael A. Plisky 
said Monday. "That was made perfectly clear." 
</P>
<P>
 The gambling project was denied in June after hundreds of residents jammed the 
council chambers to oppose the plan. That same night, Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury announced a probe into a money-laundering and political corruption 
scheme he associated with the casino gambling project. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men involved last summer in proposing a casino were charged in October 
with money laundering by making illegal donations to local campaigns. That 
criminal case is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Marasco, 48, of Ventura and Michael E. Wooten, 45, of Camarillo, who 
co-owned the now-defunct Darrik Marten Co., were charged with six misdemeanors 
each for allegedly making about $1,000 in illegal campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial is scheduled Feb. 22 in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky's 1992 mayoral campaign was one of four local elections that the 
district attorney's office said received illegal contributions. Plisky said the 
hotel and convention center proposals do not detract from the influences 
24-hour gambling would bring to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect all the rest of that stuff is just window dressing to get the card 
club approved," said Plisky, who prosecutors said was unaware of the allegedly 
illegal contributions made to his campaign. "We've got hotels now that are 
barely making ends meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said Monday that he too would have a hard time 
approving any legalized gambling in his city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally do not believe in gambling," Lopez said. "As to a specific 
proposal, I think I would have to reserve judgment on it. But the gambling 
aspect of it, I don't think I could support." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Bokron's project meets the approval of the City Council later this 
year, the Ventura County district's attorney's office maintains that it would 
also require the approval of Oxnard voters to open a casino of that scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The addition of a hotel has no impact on our opinion regarding card club 
casinos," Special Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald D. Coleman said Monday. "They are 
of questionable validity to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the district attorney and California Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren said 
that under existing law, any card house in Oxnard would have to be approved by 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that opinion, however, Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig has said the 
council could approve a card club without voters' consent because the city 
allowed gambling before the gaming law went into effect 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gillig was not available to comment on Monday, and his assistant Paula 
Kimbrell declined to comment. But Gillig has maintained that he stands by his 
interpretation of the 1984 state gaming law. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman refused to say whether the district attorney's office would file a 
legal challenge to any approval of a card club by the City Council. But he did 
say "the city would be inviting litigation on the matter" by allowing one. 
</P>
<P>
 Bokron is a longtime businessman who has managed or owned a series of 
restaurants in the Oxnard area for many years. Prior to that, he spent several 
years working as an organizer for the culinary workers union before going into 
business for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the Old Timer restaurant in downtown Oxnard decades ago, and later 
moved it to the Wagon Wheel center before closing it in 1989. Bokron also ran 
the Golden Dolphin restaurant in the Channel Islands Harbor in the early 1980s 
before it went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of Bokron's hotel-casino plan comes seven months after 
council members voted unanimously to deny another proposal that would have 
established Oxnard as a destination for big-time gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bokron said the posh hotel-casino development would rival vacation resorts in 
Los Angeles and Nevada by offering a 164-room hotel, a 5,000-seat theater and 
dozens of specialty shops and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should hang a sign over the freeway that says, 'Oxnard: The Biggest 
Little City in California,' " Bokron said, in a reference to Reno, Nev. 
"Because that's what it will be eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 Bokron envisions an expansive center that would house not only a card 
club-casino of 45 to 75 tables, but also offer guests everything from fine 
dining and entertainment to first-class accommodations and convention 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you're in that complex, you'd have no reason to go out," Bokron said. 
"There's places to sleep, places to eat, entertainment. You name it, it's 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Chamber of Commerce last year endorsed the concept of pursuing a 
gambling casino for the city in a split decision, but Executive Director Penny 
Hoffman said Monday that she did not have enough information to support 
Bokron's project. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant working for Bokron said the hotel and casino would generate about 
1,200 jobs and substantial taxes for Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be revenue coming in that this city needs," said Mary 
Pallais of Pallais & Associates of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pallais, the latest project is being touted by local business 
people with local ties and local reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people involved are long-term residents of the county who have high 
morals," she said. "People know them. It's not just a card room. We're looking 
to bring in the tourist trade." 
</P>
<P>
 But that contention does not sway Jeffrey Brown, a local stockbroker who last 
year opposed high-stakes gambling in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's enough negative fallout that (the hotel-convention center) doesn't 
provide an offsetting benefit," Brown said. "We don't need gambling here. What 
we need is industry that would promote good jobs, manufacturing jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The minister of the First Presbyterian Church of Oxnard, who vocally opposed 
legalized gambling before the City Council last summer, said a hotel-casino 
would do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tempts people to spend money on gambling that probably is needed for 
basics," said the Rev. James Bain. "You would have a lot of families hurt, and 
it would hurt the image of Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the applicants behind one of last year's card house proposal said 
Monday that if the City Council is now leaning toward endorsing gambling in the 
city, it should hear other offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's going to be reconsidered, they should open it up for everyone," said 
Wooten, one of the former card house promoters now facing misdemeanor charges 
in the contribution-laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a proposal intended to bring gaming to Oxnard," said Wooten, who also 
is an attorney. "It's being dressed up with a hotel and convention center, but 
the issue is still the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the slew of opposition the other card house proposals met last year, 
Bokron remains confident his project will meet the approval of residents and 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are 50,000 more people out there that are for it," he said.

HOPEFULS SPENT $222,000 IN VENTURA COUNCIL RACE, AMONG CITY'S COSTLIEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 At least $222,000 was funneled into last year's Ventura City Council race, one 
of the costliest elections in Ventura history. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, pro-business candidates spent the larger amounts of money in the 
race. Unlike recent elections in which political action groups helped pump a 
lot of cash into the contest, most of the funds in last year's council race 
came from fund-raising events candidates held on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, the top vote-getter in November's council 
race, took in and spent the most money, according to financial disclosure forms 
filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures, 56, is a former banker who currently manages her family's trust 
fund. She spent $35,884 on her campaign, which included a loan of $6,000 from 
her trust fund and her husband's trust. Her campaign funds came from a variety 
of sources, including local businesses and developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Bennett, a Nordhoff High School teacher who pledged not to 
accept donations of more than $100, spent $21,487 for his second-place finish. 
Bennett received support from unions and environmental groups and gave a 
personal loan of about $3,700 to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Monahan reported spending $19,825 for his fifth reelection bid. 
Monahan, a welding contractor who has consistently supported development, 
received many contributions from local unions, developers and car dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle, who came in fourth, spent $12,168 on his campaign. 
Tuttle, who comes from an environmentalist and grass-roots background, received 
contributions from some unions and Patagonia, the apparel firm that helped 
catapult him into city politics in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, 12 of the 14 candidates who ran for council seats had submitted 
financial disclosure forms as required by state law. Many contributors were not 
identified because they gave less than $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Schmitz, a certified public accountant, and Dick Massa, who owns a 
medical-supply company, have not filed their disclosure forms. They finished 
sixth and 10th, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council candidates reported their expenditures as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 Clark Owens, a real estate broker, reported $21,865. Virginia Weber, an 
educational grants administrator, reported $17,206. Nancy Cloutier, who owns 
the Ventura County & Coast Reporter, reported $15,567. Todd Collart, a county 
planner, reported $10,506. Charles Kistner, a business owner, reported $7,114. 
Neil Demers-Grey, a secretary, reported $1,155. Carroll Dean Williams and Brian 
Lee Rencher reported receiving and spending less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Political action groups also reported spending at least $51,771 in the 
campaign to promote or attack candidates. Although no candidate actively 
engaged in negative campaigning, last year's council race was marked by 
mudslinging from some political action groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Venturans for Responsible Government, a group composed for ranchers, 
developers and other business interests, reported spending $12,598 in a 
campaign that harshly criticized Bennett, Tuttle and Collart, who lost his 
reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia, which helped engineer the 1989 victories of Tuttle, Collart and 
Cathy Bean, spent about $8,782 in advertisements promoting Tuttle, Bennett and 
Cloutier. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrift store magnate Ray Ellison, who ran a negative campaign against Tuttle, 
Bennett and Collart, reported spending nearly $15,000, according to a report 
filed last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Chamber of Commerce, which helped elect three pro-business 
candidates in 1991, spent $11,338 in support of Measures, Monahan, Schmitz and 
Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Barbara Kam said the remaining forms may arrive by mail and will be 
acceptable if they are postmarked by the deadline. After a 10-day grace period, 
any candidate who fails to disclose records of campaign finances is subject to 
a fine of $10 per day, Kam said.

CHANCES OF A WET YEAR EVAPORATING; WEATHER: THE PATTERN OF DRY WINDS AND LITTLE 
RAINFALL CONTINUES, RAISING FEARS OF ANOTHER LONG ARID SPELL. BUT RESERVOIRS 
ARE STILL IN GOOD SHAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As dry winds swept across Ventura County on Monday, hydrologists marked the 
end of another month with below-average rainfall, raising fears that the county 
and state may be entering another dry year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainfall totals countywide are only 36% of normal for this point in the rainy 
season, and no rain is on the horizon at least through Sunday, meteorologists 
say. The statewide snowpack, which helps determine how much water can be 
shipped to Southern California, measured only 45% of normal, the state 
hydrologist said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the National Weather Service's long-range forecast through April 
calls for a 51% chance that rainfall will be below normal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture is not all gloomy, officials said. Reservoirs throughout the 
county and state are still in good shape from the previous two years, when 
rainfall was 125% and 180% of normal, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground-water basins are still relatively full as well, said John Weikel, 
senior engineer in the county's Flood Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if this dry weather persists for any amount of time, we'll be back into 
water conservation measures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still hopeful of getting some significant rain in February and March," 
he said, noting that the rain year that began in October has three months to 
go. "Back in 1991, we had even less rainfall at this time of year and February 
and March brought us back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the rainfall picture is similar to that in Ventura County, said 
Maurice Roos, the state hydrologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Roos said the best months for snow are December, January and February, 
followed by November and March. And with two of the three most productive 
months already past, Roos said the outlook is for a drier-than-normal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was drier in 1991 than it is this year," he said. "It's not as bad as the 
worst, but it would sure be nice if it were better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reservoirs throughout the State Water Project's network are still in good 
shape with the carry-over from last year, Roos said. Overall, the reservoirs 
are at 95% of their normal levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ventura County is stuck in a pattern of no rainfall and dry winds. 
Although the winds that gusted up to 40 m.p.h. in Camarillo on Monday caused no 
notable damage in the county, they are a headache to farmers, said Rex Laird, 
executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The dry winds batter tree fruit and lower the price they bring on the market. 
And the lack of rain is forcing farmers to irrigate during a period when they 
can usually count on rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not raining, they're having to turn on their pumps, and that costs 
them money," Laird said. And irrigation is a poor substitute for a good, 
drenching rain, which washes the leaves and forces salts in the soil below the 
root zones of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Laird hasn't heard many complaints. "Farmers have so many adversities that 
they are just kind of used to this," he said. "It comes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
 And for the time being, at least, there is plenty of water to pump. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground-water basins are in excellent condition, said Frank Royer, assistant 
general manager of the United Water Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Piru is about half-full, after the district released its water down Piru 
Creek and into the Santa Clara River to help replenish ground-water basins. 
</P>
<P>
 That also makes room for runoff this year, Royer said. In the past two years, 
United has diverted 225,000 acre-feet of water from the river into underground 
basins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in as good a shape as we were at the beginning of the drought last time 
around," Royer said, referring to the six-year drought that ended in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The dry winter thus far has not affected Lake Casitas, the county's largest 
reservoir, said John Johnson, manager of the Casitas Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake is only down about 12,000 acre-feet from its capacity of 254,000 
acre-feet, which it reached during last year's storms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work on a 20-year cycle, so we're in good shape for a long time," Johnson 
said. "At the end of the 1986-1991 drought, we still had half a lake. So a dry 
spell that lasts for one year is relatively insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir levels in the State Water Project bode well for a good supply 
this year for Southern California users like the Calleguas Municipal Water 
District, said Donald Kendall, district general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which supplies Simi Valley, Moorpark, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo 
and Oxnard with all or some of their water, is now buying water to inject into 
the ground for storage, where it can be pumped out during dry months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is that the water gets you through the dry years without 
having to ration," Kendall said. "You take advantage of the water when it's 
available." Rainfall Comparison

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HIGH SCHOOL BAND INVITED TO WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years after American forces landed at Normandy, a Ventura County high 
school band is preparing to land on a different shore to celebrate the 
anniversary of the World War II invasion of Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hueneme High School concert band has been asked to perform in Washington, 
D.C., on June 22 for a 50th anniversary commemoration of the famous battle. 
</P>
<P>
 As the only high school band selected from California, the group will 
represent the state at the three-day Normandy Liberation and Bicentennial Music 
Celebration that is being sponsored by the French government. They would join 
about 35 bands from other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival organizers said they chose the Hueneme High band on the 
recommendation of a national association of symphonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Hueneme High band earns consistently superior ratings at music 
competitions, band director Michael Doty said. And the walls of the Hueneme 
High band room are lined with trophies and plaques earned in contests from 
Norwalk to Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most of the flutists, drummers and other student musicians in the 
group, Washington would be the farthest they have ever traveled from home, Doty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said they were surprised to learn they had been chosen for the trip, 
to include sightseeing tours in the nation's capital. "I was flabbergasted," 
said John Montes, a senior who plays clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they just have to raise the money to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Doty estimates it will cost $950 per person, or about $53,000, to send 50 
students and five chaperons. 
</P>
<P>
 That's roughly $50,000 more than is left from the band's last candy sale. But 
Doty said he is confident they will raise most of the money from local 
businesses and service organizations throughout the state. Parents will have to 
chip in the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides giving the students an opportunity to travel, Doty said the trip would 
benefit the children musically. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so limited here," Doty said. "They're used to audiences around here 
who appreciate them because they're their own sons and daughters." 
</P>
<P>
 At the celebration in Washington, the student musicians would be treated more 
like professionals, the band director said. "They'll have to play in a location 
they've never played in before and hear applause from people that have never 
seen them before," he said. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: 5TH SUSPECT HELD IN SLAYING AT MOTEL 
</P>

<P>
 Police have arrested a fifth suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of 
a Whittier man at a Ventura motel in December, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Serrato Cortez, 21, was taken into custody Thursday and booked into 
County Jail on suspicion of acting as an accessory to the Dec. 18 murder of 
21-year-old Paul Martinez at the Motel 6 on Johnson Drive, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez, of Port Hueneme, was released on $5,000 bail and is expected to be 
charged by the district attorney's office on Thursday, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Matthew J. Hardy, who is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other suspects were charged with murder last Thursday, and a woman was 
charged with being an accessory to the crime for trying to help cover up the 
slaying, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three murder suspects are being held in jail in lieu of $1 million bail, 
and the woman is being held on $250,000 bail, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez went to Motel 6 the night of the shooting with a friend from Los 
Angeles and a group of people from Santa Paula, police said. The shooting 
occurred after an encounter with a group of people from Oxnard and Port Hueneme 
that included gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have said that at least two gunmen opened fire from inside their 
cars in the motel's parking lot. Martinez was shot and killed as he stood on 
the second-story walkway. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; STUBBORN RIVERBED BRUSH FIRE SMOLDERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A stubborn brush fire along the edge of the Santa Clara riverbed was still 
sending up plumes of smoke Monday as investigators continued to search for the 
cause, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires began about 7:30 p.m. Saturday in three separate spots, then joined 
together, covering eight to 10 acres, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters had a tough time reaching the flames because they had to carry 
water hoses through several hundred yards of thick bamboo. The blaze was south 
of the Buenaventura Golf Course, near radio station KBBY-FM on Olivas Park 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fire was brought under control by late Saturday, it continued to 
smolder through the weekend. Two county fire companies along with a bulldozer 
and a water tanker were dispatched again about 10 a.m. Monday to douse a couple 
of hot spots, said Sandi Wells, a spokeswoman for the county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said investigators have found several campsites they believe may be 
related to the fire, but they have not ruled the blaze to be arson. JULIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PARK-AND-RIDE LOT FOR CAR-POOLS TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans officials on Monday announced they will open a new park-and-ride lot 
in Camarillo on Thursday to offer another location for car-pools and help 
relieve traffic congestion into Los Angeles following the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a vital necessity now," said Patricia Reid, a Caltrans spokeswoman.The 
new lot, which is located just south of the Ventura Freeway on Pleasant Valley 
Road, is designed to be a staging area for car-pools and van-pools. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the 18th park-and-ride facility in Ventura County, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lot has 140 parking spaces and special area for locking bicycles. The 
park-and-ride lot will be lighted and open 24 hours a day, but has yet to 
receive bus service, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those who car-pool or van-pool, this will make it easier," Tricia Price, 
regional manager of Commuter Transportation Services, a division of Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said she anticipates an increased number of Ventura County residents 
will car-pool to work because of increased traffic on the Ventura Freeway 
following the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo has one other park-and-ride at Las Posas Road and the Ventura 
Freeway, which Camarillo City Manager Bill Little said has been helpful and 
well-used. 
</P>
<P>
 Little said the city realized a new facility was necessary after receiving 
numerous complaints from residents in the Pleasant Valley area saying commuters 
were parking on their residential streets in the morning to catch car-pools or 
van-pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new park-and-ride lot cost $197,400 to construct and was jointly built by 
Caltrans and the city of Camarillo. The city paid for the design and Caltrans 
paid for construction, she said. Caltrans will operate the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The park-and-ride lot's grand opening will be at 10 a.m. Thursday. TRACY 
WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CRAVEN WILL SEEK 3RD COUNCIL TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Camarillo City Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said Monday that she intends to 
seek a third term on the City Council in November's general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven is the first of three incumbent council members whose terms expire in 
November to announce a bid for reelection.If elected, Craven, a former mayor of 
the city, will start her third term in office. After an unsuccessful bid in 
1982, she was elected to the council in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I want to run again because there are issues coming before the 
council that I would like to have a hand in resolving," Craven said. "I feel 
like there's still important work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49-year-old councilwoman said that, if reelected, she will concentrate on 
maintaining the city's conservative fiscal policies, continuing to support the 
creation of affordable family housing in the city and working to see that a 
Point Mugu Navy base proposal to open its runway to civilian and cargo traffic 
does not adversely affect Camarillo residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Also up for reelection in the fall are Mayor Ken Gose and Councilman Stan 
Daily. Gose said Monday that he has not made up his mind whether he will run. 
Daily could not be reached for comment Monday. The candidates' filing period 
opens July 18. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY LEADERS APPROVE ANNEXING 87 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council on Monday gave final approval to annexing 87 acres of 
city-owned lemon and avocado orchards at the northeast corner of Telegraph Road 
and Petit Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they are annexing the parcel so they can avoid paying 
$20,000 annually in property taxes to the county.The land is zoned agricultural 
and under the city's Comprehensive Plan, is scheduled to stay agricultural 
until the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura-based developer Ron Hertel has proposed that he swap agricultural 
land that he owns with the city's land, and put up single-family houses on city 
land. In exchange, Hertel would give Ventura $2 million to build a park on 92 
acres of celery fields that he owns at Telephone and Kimball roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members have expressed interest in Hertel's idea, but no deal has 
been finalized yet. Last week a council subcommittee recommended that the city 
consider rezoning the 87 acres from agricultural to permit residential 
construction. The council is scheduled to vote on the zone change Feb. 14.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEW EDUCATION TEST DATA DUE BY FEB. 18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the state prepares to release the first results of a new test, Ventura 
County education officials on Monday said the figures will give teachers a 
better idea of how well students are learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Results from the California Learning Assessment System, known as CLAS, will be 
released by Feb. 18, said Diana Rigby, director of curriculum and instruction 
for the Ventura County superintendent of schools' office. 
</P>
<P>
 The new test, initially administered statewide last spring, is meant to 
measure how well students perform by having them write essays or solve 
mathematics problems and show how they arrive at their answers. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS replaces the California Assessment Program, which used multiple-choice 
questions to measure students' abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supt. Charles Weis likened such a multiple-choice test to 
measuring students' ability to play basketball by quizzing them on the rules. 
The CLAS testing program offers a much better approach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we're giving you a ball, putting you out on the court and letting 
you shoot," Weis said. "It's a real era change for assessment." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the test is expensive to develop and score. More than 1,500 teachers 
gathered at 25 sites across the state to grade the tests. Because of the 
complexity, results have been delayed from the original release date in 
October, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a price tag of $27 million, the new test is three times most costly to 
administer and score than the CAP test, officials said. Last year, students in 
fourth, eighth and 10th grades were tested in writing, reading and math. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, fifth-graders will be included and will be tested in science and 
social studies. Perhaps most significant for parents is that for the first time 
the state will be reporting the scores of students, not just schools. BRENDA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CITY TO VOTE ON JOINING WASTE DISPOSAL 
EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley and Moorpark officials are anxiously awaiting the expected opening 
later this month of a hazardous material recycling center -- two years in the 
making -- that will allow residents to legally dispose of used oil, paints, car 
batteries and antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been heading in this direction for quite some time," Moorpark Mayor 
Paul Lawrason said Monday. "You need a place to dispose of those things. 
Obviously, we have nothing like that in our city at the present time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council on Wednesday will vote on whether to officially join 
Simi Valley in helping pay for construction and operation of the center at 
670-A W. Los Angeles Ave. in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the action to be considered by the council, Moorpark would pay $15,500 
as its portion of the $70,000 cost of building the center, and would agree to 
pay between $27.50 and $51 for each trip to the center by a Moorpark resident, 
based upon the amount of waste dropped off. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the action at its meeting beginning at 7 p.m. in 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility, which is already built, is scheduled to open on Saturdays from 
noon to 4 p.m., weather permitting, on an appointment-only basis. Officials 
hoped it have it open by Feb. 12, but said difficulties related to last month's 
earthquake could delay that by a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the recycling center opens, residents will be allowed to drop off up to 
10 gallons of paint or antifreeze, two automotive batteries and up to 20 
gallons of used motor oil per trip. Simi Valley Councilman Bill Davis said it 
makes sense for the two east county cities to join forces in establishing the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way you pool resources," Davis said. "It costs both cities less money to 
build and serves that many more people. You're picking up many, many more 
people and saving taxpayer dollars." JAMES MAIELLA JR.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOARD OKS SPECIAL SEX-ED GUIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following nearly a year of discussion, the Ventura County Board of Education 
on Monday approved new sex-education guidelines for county-run schools that 
serve disabled children and troubled teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 To the relief of some teachers in the county's 18 programs for 
special-education and at-risk students, the new policy sets no new restrictions 
on teaching methods used in sex-education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is broad enough for us to work under," said Diana Novak, special education 
director for the county superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But county board member Wendy Larner, who was elected in 1991 with the support 
of the conservative Pro-Family Caucus of Ventura County, said Monday that she 
still hopes to set new restrictions on sex education when individual schools 
bring their curricula to the board for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sex-education guidelines set out general principles for each 
school's curriculum, the county board still must give separate approval to each 
school's teaching plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Larner has said she opposes teaching about contraception and certain other 
aspects of sexuality because it could send students the message that premarital 
sex is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 In hearings over the past several months on sex-ed guidelines, special 
education teachers said they need to be free to use certain teaching methods 
with disabled children that may not be needed in regular classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Disabled students typically learn best through specific examples rather than 
general ideas, teachers told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our students don't learn in the abstract," Novak said. "It has to be very 
concrete." 
</P>
<P>
 In one county-run school, for example, a nurse uses drawings of a naked man 
and woman to teach teen-agers how to name body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines approved Monday state that each school's "curriculum shall be 
appropriate for use with students of various ages, learning abilities and 
special needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The county runs 12 educational programs for disabled or special-education 
students and has another six schools for troubled youths, including those who 
left regular schools because they became pregnant or got into trouble with the 
law. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; LAW WOULD REGULATE BUILDING REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council on Wednesday will consider adopting an urgency 
ordinance that would regulate the reconstruction of buildings damaged in last 
month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere in our codes does it say, or is it clear, how to treat a partially 
destroyed building in terms of restoring it," said Mayor Paul Lawrason."This is 
just putting in place some guidelines and requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, if 10% or less of a structure is damaged, the owner need 
only bring the building into compliance with the building codes that were in 
place when it was built. If between 10% and 50% of the building is damaged, 
then the portion being repaired must be brought into compliance with the most 
current building codes. If more than 50% of the structure is damaged, the 
entire structure must be brought within current codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another portion of the law sets a tough new standard for block or "garden" 
walls constructed in the city, requiring all such walls to be designed by a 
professional engineer or architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said he has problems with that section of the law because of the cost 
it would impose on residents and businesses. "I understand the reason for it, 
but there must be some alternative to that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss the proposal at its 7 p.m. meeting in City Hall.

SIMI MAYOR DECLARES CANDIDACY FOR COUNTY AUDITOR-CONTROLLER; POLITICS: PLEDGING 
TOUGH FISCAL MANAGEMENT, GREG STRATTON LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN AGAINST INCUMBENT 
THOMAS O. MAHON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Saying that "business as usual is not good enough" when it comes to 
safeguarding taxpayer money, Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton on Monday formally 
declared his candidacy for Ventura County auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thrust of my campaign will be changing the role of the county 
auditor-controller to a more visible and responsive part of county management," 
Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton, 47, is running for the $115,000-a-year post against appointed 
incumbent Thomas O. Mahon. Ventura accountant Scott A. Weiss is also 
considering a bid for the controller's job, which is responsible for overseeing 
the county's $836-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Stratton pledged to bring to his new position the same tough 
fiscal management style he has become known for as mayor of Simi Valley. He 
noted that during his 14 years on the City Council -- the last seven as mayor 
-- the city's reserves have grown from $2 million to nearly $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city of Simi Valley is in excellent financial shape," Stratton 
told reporters at a news conference at City Hall. "Unfortunately," he said, 
"that's not true" of the county or the state. 
</P>
<P>
 As auditor-controller, Stratton said he would crack down on bureaucratic 
agencies that waste millions of tax dollars through inefficiency. One such 
agency, he said, is the county's Information Services Department, which spends 
$12 million a year on computer services. 
</P>
<P>
 "With my expertise in computers and software, I can go to the county and help 
save millions of dollars just in that one area alone," said Stratton, director 
of the software department at Teledyne Systems in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahon said that Stratton was speaking without knowing all the facts. Mahon 
said he did not know offhand how much the county spends on computer services, 
but insisted that such flagrant waste of taxpayer money is not occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," Mahon said in reference to Stratton's statements. "As an 
auditor-controller, you don't go around making statements you can't prove." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said that if elected, he would call for more audits of county 
departments. He said he would also make sure the $26 million generated each 
year from Proposition 172's half-cent sales tax is used for law enforcement and 
fire protection, as intended by the voters who approved the ballot measure last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Stratton proposed that a portion of the sales-tax money be used 
to pay Simi Valley's share of the nearly $1 million in jail booking fees owed 
to the county. Ventura County and its cities have been waging a legal battle 
over the fees charged when suspects are arrested in a city and booked at the 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Stratton said the sales-tax dollars should be used to restore cuts 
made in the county Sheriff's Department and in the district attorney's office. 
"The incumbent was prepared to see all of the new Proposition 172 money 
disappear into the bureaucracy and not give a dime for improved public safety," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahon said it is up to the County Board of Supervisors to decide how to 
spend Proposition 172 money, not the auditor-controller. He said the only 
decision made so far regarding this money was to give $1.5 million to the 
Sheriff's Department for increased patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really criticizing the Board of Supervisors," Mahon said. "We only 
provide information to the board. The decisions of what to do with the money is 
the prerogative of the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he would like to conduct more audits of county departments, but he 
doesn't have the staffing because of cutbacks. He said audits now conducted by 
his office save the county on average about $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing an outstanding job," said Mahon, who was appointed by the Board 
of Supervisors last January to complete Norman R. Hawkes' term after Hawkes 
retired. Mahon previously served as assistant auditor for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton pledged to spend as much as $100,000 on the campaign if necessary, a 
figure that Mahon has vowed to match. Among those who have endorsed Stratton 
are Simi Valley City Council members Bill Davis, Judy Mikels, Sandi Webb and 
Barbara Williamson, who is a candidate for county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other supporters include Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason, Thousand Oaks City 
Councilman and supervisorial candidate Frank Schillo and Santa Paula Mayor 
Wayne Johnson.

REAGAN LIBRARY NAMES NEW DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Norton Smith, a historian and biographer who late last year became 
executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and the Center 
for Public Affairs, will also become director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential 
Library in Simi Valley on Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has served as director of the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library 
and Dwight D. Eisenhower Center, succeeds Ralph C. Bledsoe, who has headed the 
Reagan library since it opened in November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe, will return to Washington, D.C., to take a "high level" position with 
the National Archives and Records Administration, Smith said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the exciting things about, in effect, combining all of these 
positions is the opportunity to approach everything we do in a unified 
fashion," Smith said Monday. "Whether it's creating a temporary exhibit in the 
museum or a scholarly conference in the Center for Public Affairs or a 
promotional strategy designed to increase our visibility and visitation -- all 
of this planning will come from one office." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan welcomed Smith in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy and I are delighted to have Richard Norton Smith build upon the 
remarkable work he has already set in motion during these past few months," 
Reagan said in the statement. "We could not have found a better candidate to 
head the library. His ability is equaled only by his enthusiasm."

SECRETARY SABOTAGED ACCUSED PRIEST'S CAR TO PREVENT ESCAPE; TRIAL: CHURCH AIDE 
TESTIFIES THAT SHE AND MAID FOUND LARGE SUMS HIDDEN IN FATHER DAVID PIROLI'S 
QUARTERS. PIROLI IS CHARGED WITH GRAND THEFT. 
</P>

<P>
 A Simi Valley church secretary testified Monday that after finding bundles of 
cash in Father David Dean Piroli's rooms, she let the air out of his car tire 
for fear that he would flee with parishioners' collection money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he'd be getting away with the money, and there went our proof, and 
there went all our parishioners' cash," Eileen Slavin testified at Piroli's 
embezzlement trial in Ventura County Superior Court. Piroli, 37, faces two 
counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavin testified that her sabotage of Piroli's church car on June 3, 1992, 
occurred the day after she and church maid Dorothy Meyer searched his rooms at 
the St. Peter Claver Church residence. The search was initiated a few days 
after Piroli was arrested in a church car in Hollywood, surrounded by $10,000 
in cash, collection envelopes and traces of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's pastor, Father James McKeon, had suggested that the search begin 
in Piroli's dresser drawer because McKeon had once noticed cash there, Slavin 
testified. After she told Meyer to start there, the tearful maid summoned her 
to Piroli's bedroom and pointed to the priest's dresser drawer, Slavin 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There, Slavin testified, "I saw the money spread across the drawer underneath 
underwear and socks. . . . I felt it was about three inches deep." 
</P>
<P>
 The women and other church employees poked through filing cabinets in Piroli's 
bedroom and office, finding cash stuffed into boxes, bags, drawers and closet 
shelves, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 There were messy piles of money in a cardboard box, neatly sorted stacks of 
cash arrayed in drawers, and folded wads of $50 and $100 bills stuffed into a 
coffee can in a red filing cabinet by Piroli's bed, Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not disturb the cash, fearing Piroli might discover them in his 
rooms, Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next day, she said, after Piroli drove to Los Angeles to explain his 
arrest to archdiocesan officials, Slavin looked in the underwear drawer again. 
The cash was gone, she testified, and she could no longer open the filing 
cabinet beside Piroli's bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some time after Piroli returned, she sneaked into the garage and let some of 
the air out of the left rear tire of the church-owned Chevrolet Lumina to 
prevent him from fleeing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Piroli somehow left again, Slavin testified, she and Meyer searched his 
rooms again and found that cash was still hidden in other areas. They moved all 
the cash they found into a locked closet in the rectory, or church office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer wrestled the filing cabinet from beside Piroli's bed into the hall, and 
the two women carried it to the closet and locked it in, Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, church employees loaded all the money into Deacon Richard Hamm's 
car, including money that Meyer pulled out of the locked filing cabinet after 
jimmying it open with a screwdriver, Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 They drove it to Slavin's house, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a quarter to 6 we started counting, and we counted money until 10 after 2 
in the morning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The total: $47,666, plus $2,360 in checks, a jar full of change and dozens of 
special collection envelopes from St. Peter Claver, many of them already 
emptied, Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 On cross-examination, defense attorney Richard Beada pointed out that Slavin's 
testimony about her reason for the search failed to match an earlier statement 
to an investigator. To the investigator, she never said that McKeon had 
mentioned finding money in Piroli's drawer.

EMPLOYMENT OFFICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am curious to know why your reporters consistently refer to the Employment 
Development Department as "the unemployment office."I find no rationale for it 
except that among the functions of the office is processing applications for 
unemployment insurance benefits. The primary purpose is, as its official name 
notes, development of employment opportunities. A person does not have to be 
unemployed to be served there. 
</P>
<P>
 Television reporters use the same designation. This conveys a negative image 
to the public and anyone who wants to use the services of that department.

 Fran Menconi is putting a 20-year buying binge behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tinley Park, Ill., woman, who said her spending sprees "bordered on the 
ridiculous," is cleaning out her closets and putting racks of size 12 clothes 
and accessories in a consignment store.Bargains abound: 200 pairs of earrings 
at 50 cents each, silk blouses at $15 apiece, 100 scarves and piles of other 
duds. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Menconi: "When I felt happy, I'd buy something; when I felt sad, I'd buy 
something. And sometimes I'd buy something just because my closet was such a 
mess and I couldn't find anything."

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: EVER SO SLOWLY, A NEW LOAN PROGRAM TAKES SHAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If an award were given for persistence, it would definitely go to Rep. John 
LaFalce (D.-N.Y.), chairman of the House Small Business Committee. For the past 
10 years, LaFalce has struggled to create a government-sponsored secondary 
market for small-business loans as a way to boost the flow of capital to 
entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Venture Enhancement and Loan Development Administration for Smaller 
Undercapitalized Enterprise, or Velda Sue as it is commonly known, has 
languished for more than a decade. LaFalce, an outspoken small-business 
advocate from Upstate New York, insists that "Velda Sue is alive and well." 
Still, many congressional insiders are convinced she is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 LaFalce admits that this is not the best time to be creating a new government 
entity. Although the White House supports the concept of a secondary market for 
small-business loans, Vice President Al Gore Jr. is aggressively streamlining 
the bureaucracy, trying to eliminate government agencies, not create them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President has said we need to facilitate development of a secondary 
market for small-business loans," LaFalce said. "Now it seems the easiest thing 
is to go about it piecemeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents believe that up to $50 billion worth of small-business loans could 
ultimately be packaged and sold to investors. A new secondary market would not 
only free up more capital as banks pooled and sold off their loans, but it 
would provide investors with attractive new opportunities aimed at fueling 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite widespread support, at least six bills dealing with creation of a 
secondary market for small-business loans are stalled in various committees. 
The most promising one, introduced by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R.-N.Y.), was 
approved by the Senate Banking Committee, and a similar measure drafted by Rep. 
Paul Kanjorski (D-Penn.) was introduced in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds are as high as 90% for passing a securitization bill in 1994," 
predicted Bob Zimmer, a Republican staff member on the House Banking Committee. 
Zimmer is one of many congressional staffers who believe the private sector can 
create a secondary market for small-business loans without much government 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many experts believe the securitization can be done without the government 
assuming any of the risk," Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pooling and selling loans is not a novel concept. Currently about 50% of the 
nation's $1.5 trillion in residential mortgages has been packaged into 
securities through government-sponsored Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Student loans totaling $27 billion, $64.5 billion worth of credit card 
receivables and $59.8 billion worth of auto loans have also been pooled and 
sold as securities, according to an Oct. 13 report issued by the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The private sector, tired of waiting for Congress to act, is slowly moving 
toward creating the secondary market. Two years ago, Chrysler Corp.'s finance 
subsidiary issued $350 million in securities backed by a pool of small-business 
loans secured by real estate. Last March, Money Store issued $76 million in 
securities backed by the unguaranteed portion of some Small Business 
Administration loans. And in April, Santa Monica-based Fremont General Corp. 
sold $200 million worth of securities backed by a pool of small- and 
medium-sized-business loans. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also smaller players on the market. Target Income Fund, managed by 
Tustin-based Finance 500 Inc., has packaged and sold about $8.1 million worth 
of short-term small-business credit lines and loans, according to President 
Lance Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund, which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, has 
a diversified portfolio containing about 40 short-term loans and credit lines 
issued to small businesses. Hicks said many of the businesses are thriving but, 
for one reason or another, had trouble obtaining traditional bank financing. 
Current borrowers range from makers of plastic, clothing, computer software and 
hospital equipment to several small employment agencies and freight companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fund is essentially run like a bank," explained Hicks. Business owners 
submit applications for funds to be used for a revolving credit line or 
short-term loan. The loans, which generally carry an interest rate of 4% to 5% 
over the prime rate, are collateralized by accounts receivable and corporate 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ongoing challenge is to match the money we have available with the best 
companies," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Target Income Fund relies on Reid Rutherford, chairman and chief executive of 
Palo Alto-based Exxe Data Corp., and his marketing representatives to screen 
and process loan applications. The 9-year-old company also designs software and 
systems to help banks and other financial institutions pool and sell 
small-business loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last market left for the banking industry is the small-business market," 
Rutherford said. The problem? "Banks do have money to lend now, but the reality 
is that they don't want to put it out in small amounts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford says he's optimistic that the secondary market for small-business 
loans is about to take off and that his 35-employee firm is prepared to provide 
the tools to help financial institutions make it happen. (For information on 
applying for a Target Income Fund loan or credit line, write to Exxe Data 
Corp., 1170 E. Meadow Drive, Palo Alto, CA 94303-4234.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rep. LaFalce says he's not convinced that funds such as Target 
Income and even bigger private investors can solve the continuing 
small-business credit crunch alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "These (securitized loans) are dribbles in comparison to what we need," he 
said. LaFalce also says that even after a decade of trying, he's not ready to 
give up on Velda Sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of life in the old gal," LaFalce said. "Rumors of her demise 
have been greatly exaggerated."

 Television: With Turner Broadcasting System's acquisition Friday of film 
distributor New Line Cinema, speculation is growing that cable mogul Ted 
Turner's next target may be RHI Entertainment. Led by longtime producer Robert 
Halmi Sr., RHI is one of the top suppliers of programs to the major television 
networks, including "Lonesome Dove" starring Robert Duvall and the upcoming 
"Scarlett," a miniseries sequel to "Gone With the Wind."Traders, some of whom 
are betting Turner will acquire the rest of RHI, have been quickly bidding up 
its stock. But a spokesman for RHI denies that any such plan is in the works, 
saying the company believes the stock's climb can be attributed to RHI's 
healthy earnings outlook and record backlog. RHI's stock rose 87.5 cents Monday 
to $30.125 on the American Stock Exchange. JAMES BATES

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: WARONKER LIKELY TO GET NOD AT WARNER

 The management mystery at Warner Bros. Records is close to being solved. 
Chairman Mo Ostin is expected to extend his contract through 1996, with 
President Lenny Waronker getting added responsibilities in an opportunity to 
prove he's capable of succeeding Ostin. 
</P>
<P>
 Waronker, a former producer best known for his creative skills, will get a new 
title such as chief executive, sources say. The legendary Ostin will stay on as 
chairman, but with less autonomy. As part of the deal, Ostin has informally 
agreed to report to Warner Music Group Chairman Robert Morgado, after 
previously answering only to Time Warner's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 People close to the discussions say Morgado had planned to travel to Los 
Angeles to begin formalizing the agreement two weeks ago, before the earthquake 
struck. While the company declined to comment, it's expected that contracts 
will be signed soon. Ostin supposedly told colleagues recently that he's "one 
trip to New York away from a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources see the restructuring as a way to ensure continued stability 
at Warner, after months of speculation about possible management upheaval. 
Ostin, known for turning Warner into an industry powerhouse during his long 
reign, was rumored to be close to retiring or taking over Disney's Hollywood 
Records late last year after Morgado insisted on a direct oversight role at the 
label, whose roster includes Tom Petty, Prince, Color Me Badd and Eric Clapton. 
</P>
<P>
 At 66, Ostin has agreed to stay on at least partly to ensure a smooth 
transition for the 52-year-old Waronker, according to associates, who say Ostin 
may decide to leave before the contract extension expires if everything falls 
into place. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet sources say that's by no means assured. While Waronker is popular and 
shares Ostin's close personal ties to label standard bearers such as Clapton, 
Neil Young and Madonna, he is not known for possessing the same business savvy. 
He must also convince Morgado that he's capable of attracting the kind of young 
talent that keeps a label energized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mo wants him and has stood behind him all the way," said one well-placed 
source. "Morgado's still not sure if he can do it, but he wants to give him a 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for Morgado's skepticism, sources say, is that Waronker remains 
something of an anomaly in executive circles. He began his career as a producer 
at his father's Liberty Records, and made his name with his work on behalf of 
such leading 1970s-era singer-songwriters as James Taylor, Paul Simon and Randy 
Newman, a childhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostin tapped him as Warner's president in 1982, when the industry was in a 
sales slump, and together they rebuilt Warner into the industry's most 
consistent label. But Waronker remained in Ostin's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues say that's partly due to his painfully shy personality. One 
describes Waronker as the record industry's answer to Woody Allen, saying, 
"He's not exactly an 'up' guy." In a 1989 interview, Waronker himself said: 
"I'm not your typical record executive. I'm not much of a boss in the 
traditional sense. Every time I try to do it, it feels weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Another associate says Warner's "patriarchal" system discourages recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenny is a very astute judge of talent, a very hard-working guy," the source 
said. "But there's a little black hole of responsibility between him and Mo. No 
one can see who's really calling the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to pressure on Waronker, once he takes on more management 
responsibilities, is the strong performance of other labels in the Warner Music 
Group family. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic Group has become known as a stable for promising young acts with the 
success of the Stone Temple Pilots and the recent hiring of Danny Goldberg as 
president. Interscope has also had a hot hand under Jimmy Iovine, with rap 
artists Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner, by comparison, has been criticized for putting too much stock in aging 
artists such as Clapton and Rod Stewart, even though the label continues to 
rack up strong sales. Interscope's Iovine is consistently named as the likely 
replacement candidate if Waronker fails his tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources also wonder how much influence Time Warner Chairman Gerald 
Levin will have on the process, since his management style is more corporate 
than that of former Chairman Steven J. Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot more of a family operation when Steve was there," said one 
executive. "I don't know if there's still room for a nice guy like Lenny at 
Warner." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reality bites Hollywood: While their problems pale next to those of the 
homeless and destitute, many Hollywood executives remain badly shaken by the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. Business still seems to be running in slow motion, and many 
people admit to being distracted by thoughts of more destruction. That's 
unusual for a town that tends to distrust reality. But as one mogul said, 
"there's no getting around this one. Everyone was scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vocabulary update: A new term has entered Hollywood's ever-evolving lexicon. 
"PP-ing it," is not a scatological reference. It's an allusion to anyone flying 
on a private plane. As in, "So, are you PP-ing it, or flying commercial?"

in the entertainer's career. Levine said he does not know what Solters will be 
doing. Solters said he is still working for Jackson and will remain involved in 
various matters for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Jackson's attorneys announced that he has settled for an 
undisclosed amount a civil lawsuit brought by a teen-age boy who accused 
Jackson of sexually molesting him. Jackson has denied the allegations.

DOCUMENTARY; CHINESE DO FIGURE-EIGHTS AROUND HARDSHIPS; WINTER IN BEIJING CAN 
BE A SOOTY, FRIGID MESS. BUT A LITTLE MOONLIGHT SKATING ON THE MOAT CAN WORK 
WONDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are few things in life grimmer than winter in the Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Coal dust and soot from furnaces and stoves turn every surface a dull, 
brooding gray. Piercing, frigid winds howl down from Siberia. Chest colds, 
Beijing flu and bronchitis infect everyone, so bus and subway passengers form a 
chorus of hacking, wheezing sufferers. Frozen spittle coats the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Beijingers, Chinese and foreigners alike, can look forward to the end of 
December, when the lakes and ponds of the city and environs freeze over. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the time, between Christmas and the Chinese Spring Festival (Feb. 
10-12), for moonlight skating on the moat around the Forbidden City; for ice 
dancing and hockey matches on the frozen lakes of Beihai and Purple Bamboo 
parks, and for weekend frolics on the wide, wind-swept, frozen waters of the 
old and new Qing Dynasty summer palaces 10 miles northwest of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the booming "what next?" Chinese economy, it is probably only a matter of 
time before a flamboyant Hong Kong investor or the profit-seeking arm of the 
People's Liberation Army opens up a giant shopping mall with an atrium 
ice-skating rink. As it is, Beijing now has only one year-round indoor rink, at 
the Capital Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter skating in Beijing is glorious not because one is on ice, but because 
of where that ice is. Few other places on earth offer such dramatic settings, 
redolent of history, for ice adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 For an admission charge of only two yuan, about 25 cents, for example, skaters 
at Beihai Park are entitled to two hours on the ice -- periodically swept and 
smoothed by broom-bearing maintenance crews -- at the foot of the White Pagoda 
Temple and Ming Dynasty Round City. 
</P>
<P>
 For the equivalent of 30 cents, visitors can rent skates or the chairs on 
runners known as bing che.  
</P>
<P>
 Getting outdoor exercise in Beijing is not always easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Street traffic is predatory, so jogging is not advised. Thousands of yellow 
taxi vans -- called "bread loaves" by Beijingers -- roam the streets in 
high-speed pursuit of pedestrians. Also, joggers must vie with bicycles and an 
increasing number of motorized tricycles for space on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But our family of four -- including an 8-year-old girl and 5-year-old boy with 
seemingly limitless energy -- quickly discovered that taking to the ice in 
Beijing was a way to get our exercise, encounter China and avoid the careening 
yellow bread loaves. As of this writing, no traffic fatalities have been 
reported on the ice of Beijing parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was a bit daunting for the middle-aged parents, whose closest 
previous contact with solid water not in a glass was a 1979 ice storm in Texas, 
to wobble out on the ice for the first time.  
</P>
<P>
 My wife, who believes that department store elevators move at dangerously high 
speeds, found security on the ice by holding on to the back of one of the bing 
che chairs and pushing it around while shouting, "Watch out! Watch out!" 
</P>
<P>
 I personally discovered that ice skating is actually aided by the middle-age 
-- uhmm -- "settling" of body mass. The center of gravity, lowered -- in my 
case to a few inches above the ice surface -- helps maintain balance and makes 
falling something less than life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 That part mastered, the neophyte foreign skater in Beijing is left with 
perhaps the most difficult challenge: ice skating while attempting to speak 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that it was former University of Texas football coach Darrell Royal, 
or someone like him, who defined the most basic test of physical competence as 
the ability to walk and chew gum at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The next skill level is skating and speaking a foreign language at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Level three is skating and attempting to speak Chinese, a language nearly 
impossible to speak even when standing still. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with any experience here knows that Chinese people in parks are 
gregarious and inquisitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Skating in Beijing is an outdoor exercise experience punctuated by 
interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which country people are you?" is the most common demand, usually asked by 
someone skating maddeningly fast -- backward. 
</P>
<P>
 However, on a recent evening outing under the lights at Beihai Park, I was 
startled by a questioner who demanded: "What age?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was only later that I realized the woman who posed the question was 
inquiring about one of my children, skating beside me at the time. But at the 
time, startled and vulnerable on the ice, feeling very much my age and more, 
all I could do was blurt: "47 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Thank God I was not chewing gum at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to our incompetence on ice, many of the regular Chinese skaters 
are poetry in motion.  
</P>
<P>
 Zhang Meisheng, a retired building inspector, ice skates every day he can on 
Beihai Lake in the center of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Around him on the ice, helmeted members of the Beijing City Young People's 
Speed Skating Assn. blur past at astonishing velocities while their coach -- a 
"home-style" restaurant owner named Zhang Peng -- barks commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples tango and waltz near loudspeakers pouring out music. Uniformed 
soldiers of the People's Liberation Army flail and helicopter their arms in a 
futile effort to avoid crashing. Lovers take turns pushing each other on the 
bing che chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zhang Meisheng, 67, is a study in grace at his spot near the island in the 
middle of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, elegantly, he raises one leg in an arabesque, turns, reverses 
direction, his head and arms extended downward, almost touching the ice. 
Serenely, meditatively, he completes a few slow-motion spins. In the Chinese 
traditional marriage of sport and spirit, ice skating is the source of his qi 
-- his spiritual power, his force. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice skating, he said, is the way he keeps his health and his sanity: "Beijing 
is a place where it's easy to get a cold. I've had maybe one cold in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked the best time to skate in Beijing, Zhang smiled toothlessly and 
began to recite the "Nine Nine" rhyme. Familiar to every schoolchild on the 
North China Plain, the rhyme recounts the "Nine Nine Phases" of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter is divided into nine nine-day phases, set by the Chinese lunar 
calendar.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One nine, two nine: hands can't show;  
</P>
<P>
 Three nine, four nine: on the ice go.  
</P>
<P>
 Five nine, six nine: river willows seen.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven nine -- ice crack .  
</P>
<P>
 Eight nine -- swallows back,  
</P>
<P>
 Nine nine and one nine more, oxen in the fields encore .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like many poetic aspects of the Chinese language, the rhyme conforms to a 
seasonal rhythm, invariably tied to the cycle of planting and harvesting. The 
third and fourth phases of winter are considered the best time of all for 
skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my classmates don't like it when winter comes," said Nie Minhui, 23, 
a pretty, rosy-cheeked English teacher who recently graduated from the Beijing 
Foreign Language Normal College. "They all like summer. But I prefer winter, 
because of the skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago I met my boyfriend here," she said, pointing proudly to a 
tall, handsome young man leaning rakishly against a nearby guard rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Do they have plans to marry? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not yet," said Nie coyly, punctuating her statement with a crisp pirouette. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want, she doesn't," interjected the boyfriend, Wu Kai, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 After skating in the park surrounded by Chinese culture, a popular 
apres-skating repair is Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 The American company has a franchise, complete with life-size statues of the 
Colonel -- one with a yellow complexion, the other pink -- on White Pagoda 
Island in the center of Beihai Lake.

THE WEEK AHEAD: JOHANNESBURG; A NEW POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Africa's ruling National Party, which created apartheid in 1948 and 
began dismantling it in 1990, will hold its political convention Wednesday and 
Thursday to announce its parliamentary candidates and present its platform for 
the country's first multiracial democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In a keynote address, President Frederik W. de Klerk is expected to argue that 
the old right-wing party of white power and privilege has been transformed into 
a progressive, multiracial party uniquely qualified to govern a new South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The faithful will discuss the restructuring of the party, including a new 
constitution. Nevertheless, polls show the National Party is likely to run a 
distant second to Nelson Mandela's African National Congress when voters cast 
their ballots April 27-29.

NEXT STEP; MAKING ANOTHER DESERT BLOOM; EGYPT'S BIG PLANS FOR THE SINAI FEATURE 
A $1.4-BILLION NILE CANAL, MILLIONS OF SETTLERS AND A STRING OF COASTAL 
RESORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The peaked sands that fed and bewitched the children of Israel over 40 years 
of biblical history roll out to the end of the sky, and in their midst, 
clinging to a tenuous life, have sprung these few acres of new-sprouted olives, 
vegetables and tiny brick houses, battered by a chilly desert wind. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is called Takadom, which means "progress," and it is one of 
Egypt's tentative assertions of national possession over the vast northern 
Sinai, an empty desert roamed by invaders since the dawn of history and lost to 
Israel for 15 years, booty of the last two Arab-Israeli wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, a few dozen Egyptian families have settled in the one-room houses, 
fenced sandy lots and five acres of planted fields that the Cairo government is 
offering all university graduates mortgage-free for five years. Then, each 
family will have 30 years to pay off the $3,283 they owe for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 For Egypt, it is a way of easing the burden of population in the teeming Nile 
Valley -- where 96% of the country's 60 million people live on the fertile 
land, just 4% of Egypt's territory, that straddles the river. And politically, 
development of the Sinai asserts, once and for all, Egypt's hold on the 
strategic peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ali Abdel Qadir Ismail, 32, an agriculture graduate from the Suez Canal 
city of Ismailia who last year moved to Takadom, in the northern Sinai 
southwest of Al Arish, it is a way of staking a claim in a future -- for 
himself and for Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked for a rabbit breeding company in the private sector, making good 
money. But this is the future of my family," he said. "It is enough now that I 
live in a kingdom of my own, on land that has been irrigated with the blood of 
martyrs." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years after Israel returned the 23,622-square-mile Sinai to Egypt with 
the historic Camp David peace accords, Egypt is taking the most ambitious steps 
in its history to finally populate the vast, mountainous desert that is the 
most important land buffer between Arabs and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, digging began on the second phase of the Salaam (Peace) Canal, a 
$1.4-billion project to carry 12.5 million cubic meters a day of fresh water 
from the Nile into the northern Sinai, irrigating 400,000 acres of new farmland 
and opening the way for 3 million or more Egyptians to eventually populate a 
region that is now, despite 12 years of sporadic development, home to only 
about 250,000 Egyptians. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second-largest public works project in Egypt's history -- second 
only to the Aswan High Dam on the Nile -- and a crucial part of Egypt's plans 
not only to call the Sinai its own but to capitalize on $2.5 billion in 
investment envisioned as taking place in the neighboring Gaza Strip and West 
Bank when a peace agreement is signed between Palestinians and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Sinai development will guarantee Egypt's place in the emerging 
Middle East market and open a trade and travel corridor -- possible only with a 
final peace between Arabs and Israel -- that will link Libya on Egypt's western 
border, through the Sinai, to Israel, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and finally Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to make our plans, taking into consideration the changes that 
are happening in the area and internationally," said Hussein Gebaly of Egypt's 
Ministry of Reconstruction. "To the west we have the (North American Free 
Trade) Agreement, to the east we have the new tigers of Asia, and we have in 
our area the new Middle East market with its dimensions that are imposing 
change on us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sinai development plan, which has the highest priority in Egypt's 
five-year development projections, envisions new links between Egypt proper and 
the peninsula, either via a bridge across the Suez Canal or two new tunnels 
beneath it, an industrial zone straddling the canal at the city of Suez, 
expanded airports and power plants, mining development in the Sinai interior 
and a vast new network of housing, farmland and tourism along the pristine 
beaches of the Gulf of Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Egyptian officials are sure that it was in part the sheer emptiness of 
the Sinai -- invaded over the centuries by Jews, Romans, Muslims, Crusaders, 
Mamelukes, French and British forces -- that left the Red Sea peninsula easy 
prey for Israeli tanks when they advanced across its deserts in the 
Arab-Israeli war of 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 1982 that the last Israeli settlers, in a deal sweetened with 
cash settlements, packed their belongings and left. The Israeli army was 
replaced in front-line zones by an 11-nation military monitoring group, the 
U.S.-led Multinational Force and Observers, which has kept watch on a peace 
that only recently has seemed ready to deliver prosperity. The town of Taba, on 
the peninsula's eastern coast opposite the Israeli resort town of Eilat, was 
the last territory handed back, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the Sinai foundered under Egyptian control, in part because the 
Israelis destroyed much of the infrastructure they laid down during their 
15-year occupation. The Israeli settlement town of Yamit, near the northern 
city of Al Arish, still lies in bulldozed ruins as it was left by furious 
Israeli settlers when they were forced out by the Israeli army. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, Israeli experimental farms near Nuweiba, taken over by 
Egyptian Bedouins, fell into decline, and tourist villages built in the Israeli 
era languished along the Sinai coastline. Bedouin fishermen damaged the coral 
reefs of the eastern coast by dynamiting their catch, and a massive land grab 
by both Egyptian and foreign investors for tourist hotel development near the 
peninsula's southern tip at Sharm el Sheik threatened to irreparably befoul the 
pristine environment of the southern Sinai, with its untouched mountain 
valleys, clear turquoise waters and colorful underwater marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, Egypt, under massive pressure from international 
environmental groups, has set up a controlled development plan that is 
maximizing hotel construction along the eastern coast while imposing strict 
requirements on water desalination, garbage disposal and sewage treatment 
systems. The system should guarantee protection of the natural wonders that 
attract tourist dollars. Now, about 750 square miles of southern Sinai -- or 
52% of the Aqaba coast -- have been set aside as part of a national protected 
area that joins the Ras Muhammad National Park on the tip of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were convinced by the economic argument that you needed to protect the 
resources if you were going to develop resource-based tourism, and now they're 
very serious about it," said Michael P. Pearson, project manager for the Ras 
Muhammad preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth in southern Sinai has been unprecedented, increasing from 1,030 hotel 
beds in 1988 to 5,276 at present. That number is expected to more than double 
by 1995, producing a 1,005% growth rate over just seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharm el Sheik, the sun-washed enclave that held barely three hotels and a few 
apartment buildings when the Israelis left in 1982, is alive today with the 
sound of bulldozers, hammers and drills. The last remaining seafront along 
scenic Naama Bay and the surrounding bluffs are being filled in with hotels and 
restaurants. Everyone from Israeli hoteliers to actor Omar Sharif to the sons 
of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have claimed pieces of the action, and land 
prices have soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian entrepreneurs are backing the most massive project to date, the 
$88-million Sheik Coast development, just north of Sharm el Sheik, which will 
include a 300-room hotel, apartments, private villas and a huge jetty reaching 
into the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Hisham Gabr, 33, an anthropology graduate of the American University of Cairo, 
was one of the first to capitalize on the building boom, moving from Cairo in 
1982 to open the first private diving center in Sharm el Sheik. He reflects 
upon what it has meant for young Egyptians to come to the Sinai and, finally, 
embrace the peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I decided to come here, I said OK, the reality today is that our 
generation is dealing with the conflict between Egypt and Israel," Gabr said. 
"We do not have any choices to make. We are dealing with the leftovers of 
whatever our parents and grandparents have done. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to Egyptian belief, Israelis took Palestine by force. And according 
to the belief of an Israeli of my generation, he was brought up in a house 
where his father lived, so it is home for him. How many of us are willing to go 
through, at the end of the 20th Century, the moral and ethical questions of: 
'Was my grandfather right to take this place? And are these debts legitimate 
today? Or has so much time passed that I am no longer responsible. . . .?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I have made the choice willingly to participate in the development of this 
area. I see that the development of Sinai is definitely a personal statement, 
and not just a political act. I am a young Egyptian, I'm fed up with Cairo, 
from the crowds, from the pollution, and I need a meaning for my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The diving center, which Gabr opened when he was 26 with a loan from the 
National Bank of Egypt, is now undergoing a $3.2-million expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Just down the street, Adly Mestekawy, who opened one of the first private 
Egyptian hotels in southern Sinai, has expanded his holdings to include an 
experimental farm that is producing oranges, figs, olives and landscape 
greenery, partially with reclaimed sewage water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis left, and there was nothing here. It was for us the Wild West, 
and I'm one of the cowboys who rode in first," Mestekawy said. "From the first 
moment, I said the Israelis have left a mine of gold, and we have only to 
exploit it. There were no people, no businessmen, nothing -- only Bedouins 
without the knowledge and the know-how to exploit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Further up the coast, toward Dahab, hundreds of Bedouins, who for years roamed 
the deep valleys and coastal plains with their flocks, have since the Israeli 
invasion begun settling in and opening up shops, traditional tent-style 
coffeehouses and bamboo crash pads -- often as cheap as $1.25 a night -- for 
the youthful low-budget tourists who find in Sinai a remnant of 1960s 
California. Tie-dyed T-shirts and hashish are hot sellers on the lazy road that 
winds along the Dahab coast. The music of Lynard Skynard and Russian choruses 
filters out of coffeehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 But even they find themselves squeezed in by the five-star hotels that are 
pushing up on all sides. And the Bedouin entrepreneurs see yet another way of 
life nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is good, but it's not for everybody. And the Bedouins in Dahab, they 
have land to sell, but so what, after they've sold it, what do they have left?" 
asked Embarak Hamid Sobieh, a Bedouin who began his sedentary days as a driver 
for the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he bought land for 30 cents a square meter, opened a major tourist 
complex north of Dahab at Shark's Bay and often takes the opportunity to 
deplore the evils of Egyptian bureaucracy that have forced him over the years 
to obtain licenses and permits to stay in business. Most of the Bedouins are 
like Sobieh. They miss the ready jobs and free food handouts that came with the 
Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government asks me, who are all these Israeli tourists who come to Egypt 
and say, 'Where is Embarak? Where is Embarak?' " he said, chuckling. "I tell 
them, 'I'm a Bedouin. If they come, I eat with them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In blustery northern Sinai, where the Peace Canal is being built, the business 
focus is partly on tourism but primarily on the coming boom in nearby Gaza, 
which is scheduled for self-rule under the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian peace 
talks. The Egyptian Sinai towns of Al Arish and Rafah, just outside the Gaza 
territory, expect that they will host contractors from around the world who 
will rebuild Gaza, a Palestinian city under Israeli control for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course there are big hopes. This nation is right next door; there is only 
a barbed wire between us. We are enthusiastic to make that step," said Said 
Jomaa Shehata, manager of the North Sinai Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptian governor of northern Sinai, Mounir Shash, said the region is 
expected to grow from 215,000 people to more than 3 million, with an increase 
of more than 1 million in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Sinai was liberated, we began from zero. There was nothing at all, 
either from infrastructure or services. Now, let anyone from Israel come and 
see what happened in the Sinai, and he will have a reply," he said, pointing to 
Egypt's $430-million investment in schools, roads, power plants, telephones and 
water facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water from the Salaam Canal will be the new blood to Sinai to make a new 
society," he said. "So it is a new future. Everything will be changed here. 
With everything beginning from zero, you can create the society you want. There 
are no restrictions. Everything is possible." The Peace Canal 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt's $1.4 billion project will bring fresh water from the Nile to the Sinai 
peninsula.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin is scheduled to visit Georgia on Wednesday 
in his first trip to a former Soviet republic since the Dec. 12 Russian 
parliamentary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgian leader Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the visit "will signify the 
recognition of Georgia's independence," but Yeltsin's conduct will be 
scrutinized for clues about Russia's new policy toward the nations of the "near 
abroad." 
</P>

 Russia has supplied troops to help Shevardnadze put down an armed rebellion, 
and Georgia has joined the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States. The 
leaders will sign agreements on friendship, free trade and economic

THE WEEK AHEAD: ISLAMABAD; SEPARATIST SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across Pakistan on Saturday, shops should remain shuttered and bazaars eerily 
silent as the country observes a government-endorsed general strike to show 
solidarity with the people of Kashmir.  
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has swung her support behind the action, 
originally called by an all-party parliamentary committee in support of 
militants waging a separatist campaign in India's only Muslim-majority 
state.But the stakes don't just concern Kashmir.  
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto's image has taken a beating lately due to a messy political feud with 
her family. Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif, who came out earlier for the 
strike, accuses her of not uttering a single word in defense of the Kashmiris. 
By calling on Pakistanis to stay away from work for a day, Bhutto is trying to 
keep from being outflanked on a hot-button issue by her enemies.

INSIDER; MONEY GETS STARRING ROLE ON DIPLOMATIC STAGE; THE TREASURY SECRETARY'S 
TRAVELS FROM MOSCOW TO TOKYO SHOWED HOW FOREIGN POLICY AND THE WORLD ECONOMY 
HAVE BECOME NEARLY ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the first day of the recent U.S.-Russian summit, American business 
executives in Moscow were treated to a rare, but telling sight: Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher standing at a lectern in an elegant hotel dining room, 
stalling for time because the featured speaker was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The speaker was Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Unfortunately, Christopher 
told guests at the first luncheon session of the American Chamber of Commerce 
in Moscow, Bentsen was at that moment with President Clinton presenting a 
central element of U.S. foreign policy to Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new world that continues to unfold with the collapse of the East-West 
rivalry, the scene at the lectern in the Metropole Hotel two weeks ago -- the 
secretary of state playing warm-up act to the secretary of the Treasury who was 
delayed by a meeting at the Kremlin -- said it all: The conduct of foreign 
policy and the stewardship of the international economy have become nearly 
inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are arenas in which a clearly drawn line still divides the 
two. But in an increasing number of instances, that division is becoming 
blurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's 12-day journey across Asia, which began in Moscow and ended in Tokyo 
with stops along the way in Indonesia, Thailand and China, sought to 
dramatically set this new diplomacy apart from the past. And it served to 
underscore the new reality that the success of the domestic economy is now 
intertwined not only with the prosperity of traditional U.S. trading partners 
in Europe but, more than ever, with Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The international economy is central to our economic prospects, and to our 
domestic economic policy," Bentsen said. The Moscow summit, with its focus on 
financial matters -- in effect, the diplomacy of business rather than the 
business of diplomacy -- made it clear, he added: "Economic policy is an 
increasingly important dimension of foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lesson carried over to a large degree from the last presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy played a crucial role in Clinton's victory -- it was George Bush's 
concentration on traditional security issues that helped cement the impression 
among voters that he had let the economy go down the tubes while focusing on 
distant trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
 During its first year in office, the Administration had its problems dealing 
with more traditional foreign policy dilemmas such as Bosnia, Somalia and 
Haiti. But it succeeded on such economic issues as the North American Free 
Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is more comfortable with economic issues than he is with 
foreign policy, so when he thinks internationally, he is more comfortable 
turning to his economic team for advice," said a senior Administration official 
with ties to the Clinton campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor, Administration officials say, involves the personalities of 
the key players. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen is accustomed to an out-front role on Capitol Hill, they note. He was 
groomed for a life in the public eye, growing up as the scion of a wealthy 
Texas rancher. His association with an issue -- in this case the foreign policy 
side of the economy -- elevates it. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, who hails from hardscrabble North Dakota, played the role of 
loyal deputy in the Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter administrations. He was 
a successful Los Angeles lawyer known for favoring careful, precise, private 
negotiating over courtroom theatrics. His association with an issue is more 
likely to sweep it into the back rooms of policy debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Disappearance of the political and military tensions that dominated America's 
relationship with the Soviet Union has clearly tipped the scales. "Relatively 
speaking, the economy is more important; it is not more important in and of 
itself," said Brent Scowcroft, Bush's White House national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 But at its heart, the merged roles of economics and diplomacy in such 
circumstances as the Moscow summit demonstrate the evolution that is under way. 
So it is that the secretary of state would address a Chamber of Commerce 
luncheon in Moscow, while the secretary of the Treasury, in Beijing, would make 
the connection between key political and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a secretary of state willing to raise economic issues and a 
secretary of the Treasury willing to raise human rights issues," a senior 
Treasury official said, referring to Christopher's speech on the Russian 
economy and Bentsen's linkage of Chinese prison labor to the troubled extension 
of trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 As Administration policy-makers see it, economic improvements lead to 
political stability, which leads to respect for human rights, which leads to 
yet greater prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, human rights and economic progress can and often do go together," 
said a senior Treasury official. For example, he said, linking human rights 
standards to extension of China's trade benefits "will support economic reform, 
and economic reform will in turn help support human rights," creating "a 
virtuous circle in which progress in human rights abets further (political) 
opening abets economic development abets human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Clinton Administration focusing on the role of exports in fueling 
economic growth, just as the Bush Administration did before it, it has not been 
lost on senior officials that the percentage of the gross national product 
attributed to foreign trade has grown. Roughly 5% of the GNP came from foreign 
trade in the 1960s. Now, roughly 10% is pegged to trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is politics as much as technology that determines the level and quantity 
of trade," a senior Treasury official said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is merit in the linkage that is taking place between economics and 
diplomacy, said Scowcroft: "We're at that kind of intersection where real 
progress in world economic relationships may be possible. There can be a lot of 
tying together that substitutes for the unity that came in opposing the Soviet 
threat." 
</P>
<P>
 But, there is also danger: As political leaders find their national economies 
growing ever more intertwined with the world economy and less open to domestic 
control, they could turn to protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk that must be avoided, he said, is that Washington -- or other 
capitals -- can place such a great dependence on international economic 
connections that "the key controls pass out of national hands," leaving the 
domestic economy captive of forces beyond the control of the political leaders.

PROFILE; A POLITICAL CRUSADER SUITS UP AGAIN; RAFAEL CALDERA IS BACK AS 
VENEZUELA'S LEADER. BUT WILL HE TAKE HIS COUNTRY INTO THE FUTURE OR INTO THE 
PAST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rafael Caldera first ran for president in 1947. Harry S. Truman was in the 
White House, and Venezuela was an economic mess governed by corrupt and 
inefficient autocrats with a restless military looking over their shoulders. 
The 31-year-old candidate was viewed as a loose cannon of national politics, 
and he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Time has passed, but much remains the same. Venezuela is again an economic 
mess, its last government was corrupt and inefficient, and the military looms 
ominously in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 The big difference is that Caldera will become president Wednesday, having 
defeated 17 other candidates in national elections Dec. 5. But even now 
Caldera, 78, is seen as a loose cannon, a crusader trying to re-create himself 
and his country in the image of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, at least, it is a pretty impressive past. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldera was born to well-off parents in the rural community of San Felipe in 
1916. He was educated in private Roman Catholic schools until attending the 
Central University of Venezuela, where he studied to be a lawyer. He also 
started a family, marrying Alicia Pietri, from an influential Caracas family, 
and fathering six children. 
</P>
<P>
 He was politically minded almost from the beginning, writing articles while in 
college about the need to modernize Venezuela and to create an updated labor 
movement. He also led a student political movement, which in combination with 
all his critical writings led to his arrest in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't slow him down. He learned six languages fluently, became a professor 
of sociology and, over his lifetime, has written or edited at least 20 books. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was politics that drove Caldera. He ran successfully for Congress in 
1941 and in 1946 was the key figure in creating Venezuela's first modern 
political party, the Committee for Independent Electoral and Political 
Organization, known by its Spanish acronym, COPEI. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venezuela of those days was a tough place politically. After he lost the 
presidency in 1947, the military took power. Caldera's stringent opposition led 
to his arrest in 1957 and exile the next year. He returned with democracy in 
1959, resumed his leadership of COPEI, running for president four more times, 
including a winning candidacy in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 His five-year term was remarkable. In line with the exploitation of the 
Western Hemisphere's largest oil reserves, Caldera followed economic theories 
then popular in Latin America: massive government intervention, nationalization 
of major industries, subsidies to a middle class he essentially created. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a country where politicians expect to get rich in office (two recent 
presidents have been charged with corruption crimes), Caldera built a 
reputation for honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a golden age, but one that began to collapse at the end of his term. 
Venezuela began a roller-coaster ride of boom and bust according to the price 
of oil. By the end of the 1980s, the country was in a trough, hard-hit by low 
oil prices, rising debt, a government manacled by corruption and an inefficient 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, both his party and his major opponents turned toward a 
free-market economy along with an opening within the political structure aimed 
at internal democracy. Caldera was turned out as leader of COPEI and ultimately 
quit the party and formed a new organization that was based almost entirely on 
his own personality and ideas. And that is how he ran for president last year 
in his sixth try. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campaign was a crusade on his own behalf, a very personal effort, to 
convince the country and the world that he was the only one to save Venezuela 
from the clutches of degrading moral and economic policies," said a diplomat 
who has served here for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a real party or permanent organization, the diplomat said, 
Caldera won because "he showed a tremendous personal display of vitality, of 
energy and political judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign stifled rumors that he is too old, even senile, for the job. 
Aides say he wrote his own speeches, never canceled a campaign appearance and 
was always in control. "It is amazing," said another diplomat who has dealt 
with Caldera for many years. "He never seemed tired and he never was 
distracted. . . . I don't like his policies, but if anyone can make them work, 
it is Caldera." 
</P>
<P>
 A Venezuelan attorney who served in Caldera's first presidency remarked: "He 
always was an autocrat, and he remains one. In 1968 (when he was previously 
elected) he needed a party, but it was one he founded, so it did what he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this campaign. When his party (COPEI) rejected him, he rejected them 
and ran on his own without compromise. He told anyone who agreed to support him 
they did it on their own, that they would owe him and not the other way around. 
He made sure they knew there would be no electoral spoils." 
</P>
<P>
 Can it work? It is unlikely, according to most authorities. Caldera wants to 
reverse many of the free-market policies put in place over the last five years, 
including nullification of a national sales tax, privatization of industries, 
cuts in subsidies that keep gasoline prices at 20 cents a gallon and a 
renegotiation of the country's massive external debt. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this will require congressional approval, again an unlikely proposition 
given that among Venezuela's legislative blocs, Caldera's is the smallest and 
most fractured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caldera is a powerful man," one former ally said, "and he is counting on the 
public demand for change. But he was blinded by his own power before, and it 
kept him from keeping up with the times. On the other hand, I don't discount 
him. He has never given in before, and he won't now." Biography

MEDIA; POLAND'S PREMIER OF PRANKS PREVAILS; JANUSZ WEISS KEEPS 'EM LAUGHING --

<P>
 The recently returned Polish emigre was frustrated at the lack of snow in his 
yard and had learned during his stay in America that money could buy anything. 
</P>
<P>
 So he called a trucking company and asked it to deliver snow from the Tatra 
Mountains so his children could build snowmen in still-green Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucking company employee was uncertain. "OK, I'll call your competitor," 
the businessman threatened. No, no, came the reply over the phone, they would 
deliver the snow immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotcha!  
</P>
<P>
 Poland's premier prankster, Janusz Weiss, is at it again -- and much of Warsaw 
is listening in on Radio Zet. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland's first private radio station has revolutionized broadcasting in this 
former Communist country where all radio and television used to be under state 
control. And one of Radio Zet's star attractions is Weiss, with his daily 
telephone practical jokes -- a sophisticated version of the American 
third-grader's "Do you have Prince Albert in a can?" 
</P>
<P>
 But it is more than comedy. Weiss, a longtime underground cabaret performer in 
the Communist days, has gleaned important insights into what the Polish 
capital's residents are thinking about these days. And the two main themes are: 
How far has capitalism progressed, and do we really have civil rights in the 
face of the formerly totalitarian government? 
</P>
<P>
 "People like very much to check what they can do and what they can't," Weiss 
said in an interview. "These people couldn't really order a truck full of snow 
because they don't have that much money. But they like to know this kind of 
thing is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Zet's listeners set the challenges for Weiss, who is part practical 
joker and part ombudsman. 
</P>
<P>
 They tape-record their dares, which are then vetted by a committee. If the 
idea is accepted, the listener gets 1 million zlotys -- about $50 -- which is a 
lot of money in Poland. If Weiss fails to pull off the suggestion, the listener 
gets another million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of tasks where I'm asked to present myself as a foreigner or a 
rich capitalist," said Weiss, 45, whose cabaret troupe was banned in 1975. He 
later ran an underground video parlor that showed banned films during the days 
after martial law was imposed at the end of 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss puts his acting talents to good use, using a variety of voices to 
improvise his unlikely phone conversations, which are broadcast live. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the challenges are strictly jokes -- such as trying to persuade the 
owner of a car wash to clean an elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 But others plumb the taboos of Polish society -- such as asking a cafe to 
organize a reception for a homosexual wedding (agreed). Or asking the city-run 
bus company to install condom-vending machines on buses. (Bureaucrats insisted 
that "society wouldn't accept it.") 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss' challenges also examine the contradictions in a country that remains 
heavily Roman Catholic despite having been Communist for 45 years. He recently 
stunned a worker at the ex-Communist Party's headquarters by announcing that 
the Warsaw bishop had agreed to bless the building. The man accepted the offer 
and even acceded to the request that two believers be present for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "No problem," the former Communist official said. "I myself was an acolyte." 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe owner Jurek Zaporski makes a point of tuning into Weiss' program every 
day. "Life is gray and difficult," Zaporski said. "It's so nice to hear 
something funny. It improves people's moods. People need something to make them 
relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Every third radio in Warsaw is tuned to Radio Zet (a snappier version of the 
station's original name, Radio Gazeta, or Radio Newspaper), which has built 
fortune and clout on a predictable American formula: rock music, news scoops, 
competitions, games and generous cash giveaways.

 The Weiss show is only one of many ways that the station gets listeners 
involved. A telephone hot line -- "the red telephone" -- solicits news tips and 
pays the equivalent of an average month's salary for good ones. (Radio Zet 
gives away about $2,000 a day in prizes.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We always know which minister had too many drinks the night before and 
destroyed the restaurant," said the station's founder and biggest shareholder, 
Andrzej Woyciechowski. In one of the most astonishing tips, a policeman called 
in from the scene of a bank robbery before taking off in pursuit of the 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get 20 scoops a day," Woyciechowski boasts. "Every day we are quoted by 
(the Polish news agency) PAP. Two or three times a week we are quoted by (the 
Western news agencies) UPI, AP and Agence France-Presse." 
</P>
<P>
 Proud as he is of his news-gathering operation -- 70 of the station's 160 
employees are journalists -- Woyciechowski is also full of admiration for 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most difficult thing we do," Woyciechowski said of Weiss' 
program. "This requires great acting skills, lots of invention and a very big 
sense of humor. To be funny is always the most difficult thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss admitted that it is hard work, but he obviously enjoys it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very stressful," he said. "You have to be in good shape, but if I 
succeed, then I have very big satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 And even though he considers himself an expert on human behavior, the 
listeners sometimes astonish him.  
</P>
<P>
 In one recent prank, he pretended to be a talking computer, offering to 
fulfill the dream of just one person from the whole human race. 
</P>
<P>
 He instructed the woman who answered his call to speak her dream after three 
beeps. He waited for jokes -- or predictable greed for personal wealth. Instead 
there was a long silence, and then the wish: "May there be peace."

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; CENTRAL ASIA'S 'TEST-TUBE BABY'; THE WESTERN WORLD HAS SPENT 
$160 MILLION TO WEAN KYRGYZSTAN AWAY FROM ITS COMMUNIST-ERA ECONOMY. RESULTS 
ARE MIXED, AT BEST. 
</P>

<P>
 Bleak and grandiose Soviet-era government buildings still dominate the icy 
center of this capital city, a mute, powerful warning to all who would try to 
break the grip of these temples of bureaucracy on the small Central Asian state 
of Kyrgyzstan. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is precisely here that the International Monetary Fund, with the 
blessing of the United States, has tried to set up a free-market showcase for 
the 50 million people in the five newly independent states that once 
constituted Soviet Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kyrgyzstan is a test-tube baby, but it had better be healthy. If hope of 
economic prosperity dies, war starts," said Metin Goker, the Turkish 
ambassador, a rare foreign envoy to what even in Soviet times was a small, 
remote republic of 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Kyrgyz seem to have an abundance of hope. In a referendum Sunday, 
more than 96% of its citizens voted in support of their president, 49-year-old 
Askar Akayev. The president's spokesman said Monday that voters had demanded "a 
sharp radicalization of reforms, and they will follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kyrgyzstan is certifiably reform-minded, if its performance is the best 
that Central Asia can do in practice, the mostly Muslim, mostly Turkic-speaking 
peoples of the wide steppes and high mountains between Russia and China had 
better tighten their belts for a long, hard haul to free-market prosperity.  
</P>
<P>
 All five republics have used their own methods to keep new ideas at bay as 
Moscow has cut subsidies and transfers, culminating in the collapse of the 
so-called "ruble zone" three months ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have kept the lid on with repressive, unreformed 
governments. Turkmenistan has used natural gas revenues to buy off its 
population with free water, electricity and soon bread. Relatively liberal 
Kazakhstan has also benefited from huge oil and mineral wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the two regional giants, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, were forced to 
announce the progressive merging of their economies this month in an attempt to 
survive. Small Kyrgyzstan has said it will join them, and its experience may be 
a salutary lesson in the obstacles that lie in Central Asia's path. 
</P>
<P>
 Superficially, the Kyrgyz seemed to have a lot going for them: a genial and 
progressive president, Akayev; a smiling and open people; and one of the better 
human rights records in the former Soviet Union. But past habits have proved 
hard to break, and the country has become something of a test of Western moral 
and financial fiber.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every quarter the IMF comes. Unfortunately, we are not good pupils," said 
Kyrgyz National Bank Director Kemalbek Nanayev, speaking with the disarming 
frankness of his people. "Privatization is slow. We have to support ineffective 
sectors. . . . We try to adopt IMF suggestions, but not all." 
</P>
<P>
 Akayev, a convinced reformer, has no regrets about following IMF advice to 
launch the first currency in the region, the som. "Time showed we were right. . 
. . We prevented an economic disaster. We are just a small country and we could 
have been carried away in the storm of ruble inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 But once Russia cut off aid, the IMF had to step into the breach. So far, it 
has spent more than $60 million supporting the Kyrgyz currency, and the United 
States added a grant of more than $100 million. The bill is likely to go on 
mounting. Landlocked Kyrgyzstan was almost completely dependent on the Soviet 
system: 10% of its gross domestic product was transferred as straight gifts 
from Moscow, and much of its industry collapsed along with the Soviet Union. 
One day, Kyrgyzstan may produce 20 tons a year of gold, export farm products 
and perhaps hydroelectricity. But the country is so hard-pressed that a local 
prospectus currently lists such odd-sounding exports as frozen pancreases, 
nomad felt tents, antimony waste, hens' dung and the droppings of silver mice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Kyrgyz have started to cross the bridge to a free-market system, as 
elsewhere in Central Asia. They trade from kiosks on street corners or from 
blankets on the icy pavement, the economic cocoons from which free-market 
butterflies may one day emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 But everywhere, the old Soviet-era bureaucrats have proved as unwilling as 
elsewhere in Central Asia to stand aside and abandon the practices of a 
lifetime. Many officials hold that the common people are childlike and need to 
be guided. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, there is still no law allowing a firm to go bankrupt, however 
much money it loses. Kyrgyz collective farms had a surplus of wool and tobacco 
last year. But it still languishes in warehouses because the bureaucracy has 
not given export licenses. Would-be private restaurants have been closed down. 
As elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, anything private is automatically 
perceived by many as "the mafia." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the old Soviet mentality that cannot see that private good can lead to 
public good," one Western diplomat said. Kyrgyz Deputy Foreign Minister Askar 
Aitmatov put it another way, saying the government "would not permit the 
country to be ransacked." 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, who is doing the ransacking? The Kyrgyz National Bank has 
auctioned off more than $50 million of its IMF dollars, but few of them have 
been easily available to private enterprises. On the streets, few doubt that 
those close to the bureaucrats have benefited. 
</P>
<P>
 Monetary controls vital to maintaining the value of the new Kyrgyz som are 
under constant attack. Ministers and top bureaucrats believe that by providing 
long lines of credit to otherwise useless state factories they can avoid social 
unrest and jump-start the economy. The state enterprises' budget is ballooning 
with soft credit. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, inflation is ticking back up toward 40% a month. The Kyrgyz som 
has halved in value against the dollar since May and a further steep fall seems 
inevitable.  
</P>
<P>
 With the economy going back to basics, farms will be vital. Peasants are 
getting relatively rich on earnings from private plots, including the 
increasing cultivation of cannabis and poppies. But the moment anybody tried to 
sell to all comers, officials slapped on export tariffs. The "state orders" 
that defined centralized Soviet economic activity may have changed their name, 
but a plan to cut such compulsory production and purchases by 50% on Kyrgyz 
state and collective farms failed, said the acting minister of agriculture, 
Boris Talgarbekov. "Under the guise of the national interest, the majority of 
administrators are going to pursue the old, dead-end agricultural policy, which 
will bury the rural reforms," he wrote in a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers were therefore unwilling to take free-market steps like investigating 
which crops are in demand. Worst of all is the paradox that the public blames 
the collapse in its standard of living not on the bureaucrats but on the 
reforms. As Talgarbekov warned: "People are coming to hate the nonexistent 
market . . . a nostalgia for the command economy and the Communist regime has 
appeared."

POSTSCRIPT; LEBANESE SITE CLAIMED FOR BIBLICAL MIRACLE; A PROFESSOR DISPUTES 
THE TRADITIONAL BELIEF THAT ISRAEL WAS WHERE JESUS TURNED WATER INTO WINE. 
TODAY, TOURIST DOLLARS ARE AT STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a region where land and religion are prime ingredients for war, the 
controversy raging in a small village in southern Lebanon was, at the very 
least, predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to the mix one of Christ's miracles, and the recipe was sure to draw 
attention to the sleepy village of Qana. And all Qana's elders wanted was a 
place on the world's lucrative tourist maps of religious antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
 It started last year when Youssef Hourani challenged modern interpretations of 
Christ's miracle of turning water into wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourani did not dispute St. John's account of what happened that day. But he 
disputed where it took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourani, a Lebanese professor, presented what he said was a wealth of 
linguistic and physical evidence documenting that the wedding where the miracle 
occurred did not take place, as traditionally accepted, in the Galilee region 
of Israel that English-language Scriptures call Cana. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the professor said, it was performed in the hillside village of Qana, 
where archeologists have found 13 ancient, carved statues that Hourani and 
others claim represent Christ and his 12 disciples. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourani also presented the writings of theologians from the 3rd and 4th 
centuries that he contends support his theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Few took note, though, until the Pope got involved. 
</P>
<P>
 A prominent Lebanese political leader, Lebanon's parliamentary Speaker Nabih 
Berri, paid a call on Pope John Paul II last November and presented him with a 
file supporting Hourani's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Berri, a Muslim, has invited the Pope to visit the site, which includes a cave 
where Qana's Christian minority have been worshiping for centuries and is said 
to have sheltered Jesus and his companions at the time of the wedding.  
</P>
<P>
 Developments began to get touchy after Berri's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the townspeople of Qana are Shiite Muslims, and when a radical Islamic 
sheik aligned with the Shiite Hezbollah organization caught wind of it, he 
plunked down two foundation stones at the entrance to the cave and vowed to 
build a mosque there. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Shiite cleric said flatly: "We don't want the Pope in Lebanon," which 
has a large and powerful Christian minority. 
</P>
<P>
 As the controversy intensified, the most rational voices in Lebanon have been 
those of archeologists who have yet to visit the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourani was introduced to Qana in 1969, when he was invited to a dinner there. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meal, his host led a tour of the archeological sites in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that day, Hourani, a professor of history and philosophy who specializes 
in Canaanite culture, has been building his case for Qana El-Jaleel (Qana of 
Galilee), the full name of the hillside village. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourani's first line of scholarly defense against the doubting Thomases is 
linguistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Village names in south Lebanon have stayed the same for thousands of years, 
Hourani points out. He is armed with ancient maps and texts that he says show 
the name of Qana El-Jaleel has indeed referred to this town since Pharaonic 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Down-to-earth evidence also exists. Three stone water pots excavated in Qana 
in the 1960s were used by Jesus at the Wedding of Cana depicted in the Gospel, 
Hourani insists -- although there is no proven connection between Christ and a 
particular artifact. Nor is this the first case of disputed locations in 
biblical history. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Middle East is replete with them. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Kafr Kanna, the village in the Galilee region of Israel, Hourani argues 
that it has no linguistic connection with the name of the Lebanese town, which 
he insists makes a proper Canaanite connection to the time of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 He says other biblical authorities have their doubts about the village in 
Galilee as well, suggesting that it was a pious guess that was honored as the 
site of the miracle mainly because of its accessibility for early Christian 
pilgrims visiting nearby Nazareth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Lebanese Qana, today's pilgrims face a problem of 
inaccessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The cave and carvings are located on a steep hillside. Winter rains have 
turned it into a treacherous descent. Visitors gladly accept the helping hands 
of Lebanese army regulars who are stationed at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather-worn carvings are viewed by most visitors as little more than a 
curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 The real object of veneration is the cave where Christ and his disciples are 
believed to have stayed while attending the wedding. The water that seeps from 
the cave roof is claimed to have healing properties and makes the spot as 
popular among Muslims as Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese soldiers use the cave as a barracks. Their cots provide a resting 
place for the exhausted pilgrims. Army field phones share the ledges of the 
cave with remnants of pilgrims' candles. 
</P>
<P>
 The army's presence put a stop to graffiti but not the littering of the area 
with film boxes, soft drink cans and snack wrappers. Nor did it catch the 
hammer-toting vandal who recently scarred another carving that local Christians 
believe represents the biblical bride of Qana. 
</P>
<P>
 Berri, a longtime friend of Hourani, is the man of the hour in the town. 
</P>
<P>
 When trouble began brewing between the Hezbollah sheik who threatened to build 
a mosque at the site and the Shiite owner of the property, the owner gave the 
land to Berri. Berri has made it clear that the site will stand as is, a 
Christian shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the conversion of water into wine, Qana's abstaining Muslims only 
say: "Why would a holy man turn perfectly good drinking water into wine?" 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Beirut, meanwhile, the campaign is underway to get Qana placed on the 
lucrative map of religious antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
 The minister of tourism decreed the village an official tourist and 
archeological site. Brochures and posters on Qana will be distributed through 
Lebanese embassies across the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly the tourist infrastructure of Qana -- with its 10,000 inhabitants 
-- has a way to go. None of the sites is marked. Parking for the carvings and 
caves is a construction site. The guides are hordes of little boys who 
sure-footedly leap ahead, leaving the pilgrim to fend for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The best post-pilgrimage sustenance in town is available at Hassan's 
restaurant, a three-table affair serving grilled chicken. The sign outside 
reads, Vale Ni Kana Toa. That's Fijian for "house where you eat chicken" and 
testament to the cultural stew of southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1978, more than 5,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops from 10 countries have 
been stationed in the region. The battalion in the Qana area is Fijian, and 
many of its soldiers are Hassan's customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospitality at Hassan's is warm; the chicken is piping hot. Lebanese 
currency or dollars are both welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you want wine with your meal, you'll have to perform the miracle 
yourself.

MARKET SCENE; CHILEANS SAVOR SWEET ADVANTAGE IN FRUIT INDUSTRY; THE SOUTH 
AMERICAN NATION IS THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPORTER OF WINTER FRUIT. MORE THAN 40% 
GOES TO THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a busy summer day in a sun-splashed orchard, workers hurry to harvest a 
bumper crop of plump and blushing nectarines, spilling them from baskets into a 
trailer parked between rows of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 A tractor will take the nectarines to a nearby packing plant, where they will 
cool off in a huge refrigeration chamber. In a few days, after sorting and 
packing, the fruit will be trucked to Valparaiso and loaded on refrigerated 
ships going to the United States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're starting to send a lot of fruit to the United States, East 
Coast and West Coast," said Ricardo Vial, export manager for a group of farms 
here. As he strolled through an orchard, Vial listed some of the fruit he will 
be sending to California in the coming weeks: "nectarines, peaches, plums, 
grapes -- a lot of them -- and pears." 
</P>
<P>
 Chile is the world's leading exporter of "winter fruit" (not counting citrus, 
bananas and other tropical fruit), harvested when trees are bare in most of the 
Northern Hemisphere. Chilean fruit exports have grown into almost a 
billion-dollar industry, helping to nourish this South American country's 
remarkable economic development in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Depressed prices for apples in Europe made 1993 a disappointing year for many 
Chilean fruit growers. But as this season's harvest goes into high gear, they 
are expecting a happier 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, Coltauco agriculture was mostly annual crops such as corn 
and wheat, wine vineyards, and dairy herds and other livestock. Only a few 
farmers were beginning to grow fruit for export. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather Miguel started with nectarines around 1965," Vial said. "He 
exported to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, like many rural areas of central Chile, the township of Coltauco, 70 
miles south of Santiago, relies on fruit exports as a major source of 
livelihood. This is a patchwork quilt of orchards and vineyards, dotted with 
refrigeration and packing plants where workers process fruit with modern 
conveyor equipment, and where office personnel keep track of business with 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Chilean Exporters Assn., the export of fruits and vegetables 
directly employs 4.4% of the Chilean labor force, or more than 200,000 workers. 
While many of the jobs are low-skill, the export industry has increased 
opportunities for better-paid equipment operators, technicians and clerical 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile accounts for about 45% of the Southern Hemisphere's exports of apples, 
pears, peaches and table grapes, up from 4% in the early 1960s. From 1986 to 
1991 alone, Chile's fresh fruit exports increased by 69%, from 665,000 to 1.1 
million metric tons. More than 40% goes to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Chilean fruit exports brought in less than $200 million. This year's 
revenues are expected to surpass the 1991 record of $991 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's revenues dropped to $862 million, mainly because of low apple 
prices in Europe. The problem started with a bumper crop of European apples, 
which can be stored into the winter season. Amid fears that the oversupply 
might prompt the European Community to impose a system of licensing apple 
imports, Chilean exporters rushed shipments to get their apples in before any 
quotas were set. 
</P>
<P>
 The glut brought prices down rapidly. The European Community -- now called the 
European Union -- levied heavy compensatory import taxes on imported apples. 
With the added taxes, Chilean producers could not cover their costs. Uncounted 
acres of apples were left unpicked, and big growers lost millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional problem that made things worse for Chile was its lack of quality 
control. With no industrywide grading system to separate high- and low-quality 
fruit, mediocre Chilean apples pulled down prices for the good ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation has been proposed to impose an industrywide system of grading for 
export fruit, but passage appears uncertain. Meanwhile, many growers and 
exporters have agreed to start a voluntary system of quality certification. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as it isn't obligatory, it's going to be hard to make quality control 
effective," predicted Ramon Achurra, a Coltauco grower and exporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Chilean growers worry that Chile's quality control problem eventually 
could seriously erode this country's share of the winter fruit market as other 
Southern Hemisphere countries push to increase their shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In South America, Argentina is a major fruit exporter and Brazil has big 
potential for exporting winter fruits. South Africa and New Zealand are also 
important Southern Hemisphere producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina already exports more pears than Chile and almost as many apples. But 
Chile's overall fruit exports are more than double Argentina's. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa and New Zealand have been successful at developing new varieties 
of fruit that capture consumer perference. Smart Chilean growers have been able 
to follow suit, planting the new varieties as their popularity increases. For 
example, new red apple varieties that are spreading in Chile include the Royal 
Gala, the Braeburn and the Fuji. 
</P>
<P>
 Chileans also have ventured successfully into new species after spotting 
potential markets that they can supply. They planted some 27,000 acres of kiwi, 
winning a big share of the 1980s boom in that fruit, and more recently they 
have been investing heavily in berries for export. 
</P>
<P>
 A new entry in the Chilean export cornucopia is the cherimoya, a delicious 
custard fruit of Andean origin that recently has been approved for marketing in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile holds its biggest advantage in table grapes, nectarines and peaches, 
with more than 80% of the Southern Hemisphere's total exports. Table grapes are 
Chile's biggest export crop by far, and most go to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 58.3 million boxes of Chilean fruit and vegetables sent to the United 
States during the season that ended last August, 16.3 million boxes went to the 
West Coast, and all but 300,000 of those were unloaded at the Port of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Europe buy three-fourths of Chile's fruit exports. 
Exporters are trying to diversify the market, with notable success. Last year, 
sales to Latin America doubled, accounting for 14% of total fruit exports. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has been a very pleasant surprise for us," said Ronald Bown Fernandez, 
president of the Chilean Exporters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth in fruit exports to many countries has been slowed in recent years by 
international recession. But Bown predicted in an interview that economic 
recovery in the United States and other northern countries will stimulate the 
world's appetite for fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be an excellent business for Chile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Chile's Mediterranean climate, with rainy winters and sunny summers, 
give it natural advantages for fruit production. Low labor costs, relatively 
inexpensive land and a stable business climate favoring free enterprise and 
international trade have encouraged investment in fruit since the 1970s, Bown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile's fruit-growing area has expanded to nearly 400,000 acres from 116,000 
acres in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Bown said he is not worried that the Northern Hemisphere's winter fruit market 
could become saturated by increased exports from Chile and other Southern 
Hemisphere countries. He cited a trend of increasing consumption of fruit and 
vegetables in developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The exporters association is contributing $30,000 this year to a U.S. 
publicity campaign encouraging consumers to eat at least five portions of 
fruits and vegetables a day for a healthy diet. The "five-a-day" campaign, 
started in California in 1988, is sponsored by the Produce for Better Health 
Foundation in cooperation with the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Bown said emphasis on healthier eating is expected to double per-capita fruit 
consumption in the United States within 10 years. And he said the movement is 
likely to spread to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilean exporters are also interested in joining U.S. produce organizations in 
promotional projects aimed at increasing demand for different kinds of fruit. 
The Chilean Exporters Assn. recently signed a preliminary agreement with the 
California Kiwi Fruit Commission for a campaign to promote "kiwi fruit of the 
Americas."

EX-HUSBAND POINTS FINGER AT HARDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest revelation of the figure skating saga, Tonya Harding's 
ex-husband has accused Harding of helping plan the attack on Nancy Kerrigan, 
his lawyer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer, Ronald Hoevet, said he divulged the accusation in hopes of forcing 
Harding off the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, she was in on it from the beginning," said Hoevet, who 
represents Jeff Gillooly. "That's what Jeff said. I believe that to be the 
truth. It will be corroborated by other evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding said last week she became aware of the plot only after the Jan. 6 
assault in Detroit where Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee after a practice 
session and forced to withdraw from the 1994 women's national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoevet said Harding was involved in planning the attack since early December, 
after she finished fourth at a competition in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 He said much of Gillooly's account could be corroborated by phone logs and 
bank records. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoevet said the U.S. Olympic Committee "cannot wait for the criminal justice 
system to run its course. That will not happen before the Olympics. She has at 
least violated the unsportsmanlike conduct code. They've got to find a way to 
take action." 
</P>
<P>
 The Winter Olympics begin Feb. 12 in Lillehammer, Norway, but U.S. officials 
have until Feb. 21 before committing to their figure skating team. If Harding 
is withdrawn, Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance would replace her. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they would release today portions of Harding's Jan. 18 
interview with authorities in which she implicated Gillooly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly, who had reconciled and lived with Harding at the time of the 
assault, is expected to plead guilty today to racketeering in county court, 
said Judy Snyder, Hoevet's law partner. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is expected to give his version of exactly what motivated the violent 
attempt to rig the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooding suspicions about the objectivity of judges and the fairness of 
scoring in women's figure skating might have motivated the attack on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Gillooly believed that his on-again, off-again spouse had been 
given a raw deal by skating judges, and that rival Kerrigan was plainly the 
favorite of the U.S. skating establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two events in particular were cited: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Resentment over what he and his ex-wife believed was unfair scoring of 
Harding's performances at an international competition in Japan in December. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cover-story treatment of Kerrigan in U.S. Figure Skating Assn. publications 
leading up to the Detroit national championships in January. 
</P>
<P>
 This account of investigators was published Monday in the Oregonian. The 
newspaper indicated it received the information from two days of interrogation 
Gillooly underwent at the FBI office in Portland last week. It was not verified 
by officials willing to speak publicly, or by court documents. Moreover, 
Gillooly's statements are sure to be subject of doubt and challenge in this 
strange case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly is believed to be seeking a reduced sentence by cooperating with the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's more detailed account of Gillooly's story added this: Harding's 
fourth-place finish in Japan so angered him that he began planning the assault 
on his own, and then discussed it with her. The skater's first reaction was to 
question whether Gillooly's associate and her acquaintance, Shawn Eckardt, was 
the right man for the job. Gillooly explained that Eckardt was only a 
go-between. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has denied knowing of the plot beforehand. But she has admitted 
learning of events afterward and not reporting this to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-member committee of the U.S. Figure Staking Assn. is to meet in 
Colorado today and begin deliberations on whether Harding should be 
disqualified from the Olympic competition Feb. 23 and 25. A decision is not 
expected until the end of the week, at the soonest. For now, she and Kerrigan 
are the U.S. team's two entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Phillip Knight, chief executive officer of Nike, said that the 
company would donate $25,000 to Harding to defend herself, should she be taken 
off the Olympic team. Harding is not affiliated with Nike, but the company is 
based in nearby Beaverton. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the last year, Harding has finished fourth in skating competitions 
and complained about the judging. 
</P>
<P>
 After the January 1993 U.S. championships in Phoenix, she told a Portland 
journalist that she got a raw deal. Kerrigan won that competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, after the NHK international competition in Japan Dec. 9-12, 
Harding returned unhappy with her scores -- particularly her low marks in the 
mandatory technical program. Harding did not fall but was scored lower than 
skaters who did. Kerrigan did not enter that event. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the account published Monday, Gillooly said he and Harding 
brooded over what they believed was favoritism toward Kerrigan by the USFSA. 
Mentioned was the cover story on Kerrigan in the association's monthly magazine 
in December. Also mentioned was a "brochure" that highlighted Kerrigan. This 
might have been the media guide for the Detroit competition, which featured 
Kerrigan and other 1993 U.S. champions on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledgeable skating enthusiasts noted, however, that Harding has been on the 
cover of the association magazine and was on the cover of at least one of the 
organization's brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 As an event that depends entirely on the opinion of a specialized clique of 
judges, and where style and presentation are hugely subjective, grumbling about 
scoring and favoritism is widespread.

A NEW JACKSON ARRIVES; BASEBALL: BO PLAYS DOWN HIS ROLE WITH ANGELS. 'I'M A 
FOURTH OUTFIELDER,' HE TELLS PACKED NEWS CONFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was designed to be a news conference, but the moment the man walked through 
the door Monday afternoon, the Angels knew their image suddenly had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been years since they had this feeling, but for the first time since 
the Angels last had a Jackson on the field, they now have an identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie was the one responsible for delivering glamour and sex appeal to the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bo is bringing it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really never understood that magnetism he had," Angel General Manager Bill 
Bavasi said, "until today. It was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Edward Jackson, whom the world simply calls, "Bo," charmed, teased and 
mesmerized reporters and photographers for nearly an hour at Anaheim Stadium. 
It was the Angels' largest press conference since Reggie Jackson signed as a 
free agent in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 100 media representatives, including 12 TV crews. The entire 
front office of the Angels was there, no one wanted to miss the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson warned the assemblage that he's not a savior for the franchise. He 
even called himself a fourth outfielder, and said he wasn't trying to cost 
anyone a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it didn't matter. This is a guy who transcended two sports before Deion 
Sanders entertained the notion. This is a guy who is playing with an artificial 
hip, knowing it could go out at any time. This is charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who readily admit that Jackson will be an instant gate attraction 
-- but scoff at talk that it's the sole reason they signed him -- say this will 
be a cozy arrangement. Jackson will be paid $1 million if he makes the 
opening-day roster, but if he's cut in spring training, they're liable for only 
$300,000. Jackson can earn $2.2 million if he plays in 130 games, receiving a 
$200,000 bonus for every 10 games he plays beginning with the 80th and ending 
with the 130th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to take somebody's job," Jackson said. "I'm a fourth outfielder. 
My role is to play where I'm needed. I'm just here to be part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 While Jackson was talking as smoothly as a politician, he wasn't fooling 
anyone. He's not coming to California just to be close to Hollywood. He wants 
to play, whether it will be as the Angels' starting left fielder or their 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what he said," Bavasi said, "but I can't believe he goes back to 
Phoenix and works out just to be a fourth outfielder. No way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels already have a full-time DH in Chili Davis, who hit 27 homers and 
drove in 112 runs last season. They also have viable left fielders in Eduardo 
Perez and free agent Dwight Smith, who reached agreement with the Angels 
Monday. Of course, any conflict could be resolved by trading Davis, who's 
guaranteed $2.4 million this season and could earn $3.05 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no sacred cows here," Bavasi said. "This gives us flexibility that 
we didn't have before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying we're signing the same Bo Jackson. I mean, we wouldn't even be 
having this conversation if he had stayed away from football. This guy would 
have been absolutely phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then again, I wouldn't bet against him. If anybody wants to, I'll cover 
the action." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has spent his entire professional career making fools of those who 
dared to doubt him. 
</P>
<P>
 They said he never would play major league baseball after winning the Heisman 
Trophy in 1985. But he was playing for the Kansas City Royals eight months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 They said it was impossible to play two professional sports. But he was 
playing for the Raiders and Royals in 1987, earning All-Star and All-Pro honors 
in each sport. 
</P>
<P>
 They said he was finished as an athlete when he underwent hip replacement 
surgery in 1992. But he hit a home run in his first at-bat of the 1993 season 
for the Chicago White Sox, hitting .232 with 16 homers and 45 RBIs in 85 
games.. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thrived on that my entire life," Jackson said. "People told me I'd never 
amount to anything growing up. All I can say is, 'Look at me now, baby, look at 
me now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The latest challenge for Jackson is proving that the White Sox and the rest of 
the baseball world made a huge mistake when they didn't pursue him this winter. 
He became a free agent when the White Sox elected not to exercise his option, 
and with two weeks remaining before spring training, Jackson was without a job. 
</P>
<P>
 There still are those skeptical of Jackson's ability. The artificial hip 
greatly inhibits his flexibility, and he has difficulty handling an array of 
pitches. Yet, he still has average speed, a good arm and power that refuses to 
go away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wasn't so naturally strong," one rival American League executive said, 
"he wouldn't have a chance. There's only one zone where he can really handle 
the ball. But if you ask me, it's a good signing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't call this a gimmick thing because the Angels can really use this 
guy. He's still capable of hitting 20 homers and driving in 80 runs if he plays 
all season. When you think about it, the Angels don't have anything to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel President Richard Brown: "It's obvious that Bo is going to help 
sell some tickets because of his aura, but we would never bring in an 
individual just to sell tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 With Bo, it just goes with the territory.

MIKE DOWNEY: BO'S HIP TO IDEA OF BEING AN ANGEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From one-handed pitchers to one-hipped outfielders, everyone is welcome with 
the California Angels. Becoming something of a foster home for unwanted 
baseball orphans, the Angels are now the temporary guardians of Vincent (Bo) 
Jackson, a man made of flesh, blood and plastic, who evidently had nowhere else 
to go after the heartless Chicago White Sox transformed him into Soxless Bo. 
</P>
<P>
 Like chicken soup, what we have here is a can't-hurt proposition for the 
Angels, who needed a little something to heat up their fans. Already a 
restaurant across the street from their stadium, along State College, had an 
employee clambering to the top of their roadside marquee Monday to arrange 
letters reading: "BO KNOWS SEAFOOD." And the knowledgeable Mr. Jackson himself 
already understands enough about life in California to know how he intends to 
live here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to rent," he jokes, "so if it tumbles down, I won't have to worry 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Been following the quake, Bo? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he says. "I hear the earthquake insurance people are trying to find 
somebody who'll cover them ." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for a better offer, Jackson was telling friends just a few days ago 
that he planned to spend the months to come motoring around on one of his four 
Harley-Davidson motorcycles, seeing America. Some of them now think he was 
putting them on, that Bo already had this arrangement with the Angels all lined 
up, and even he smiles mischievously now and says: "When they asked what I was 
going to do, I had to tell them something." 
</P>
<P>
 Straight answers can be so boring. Take the way Jackson responded during 
Monday's visit to his new place of employment when someone asked what effect 
his synthetic hip had had on his illustrious athletic career and his general 
well-being. Bo considered this question with a comprehending nod of his head 
and a sincere tone to his reply, but what he said was: "Well, I spent a lot of 
time setting off the metal detector at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a good thing, the Angels inviting the mighty Bo to camp, even if they 
are the only ones willing to invest a few bucks in him now. Nobody is kidding 
anybody that Jackson will guide this ballclub out of the American League 
wilderness, but the price is reasonably cheap, the risk is minimal and the 
player is a genuine American icon who is all of 31 and not yet ready to be a 
biker. He thinks there's still some life in the sculptured old body. And so 
does young Bill Bavasi, the new Angel general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to be able to tell you that Jim Thorpe was back," Bavasi says. "But 
we're just looking forward to a '94 version of Bo Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 As with other multifaceted athletes of past or present, Jackson is never sure 
from one season to the next where he can ply his trade. What greater lunacy 
could there be than, for example, this long-long-longshot possibility of Bo 
Jackson's job being taken over by Michael Jordan . . . on a baseball field. 
Professional sport has become a jigsaw puzzle, one in which Deion Sanders never 
knows when he will be wearing flannel or nylon or in which Herschel Walker 
might be seen one morning stiff-arming a tackler and another morning pushing a 
sled. 
</P>
<P>
 Football was the fall pastime of Bo Jackson once, but now he wants no part of 
it. None. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much do I miss it?" he asks. "I don't miss it, because I never think 
about it. When I'm finished with something, I'm finished with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a rule in my house. No one's allowed to watch any baseball, any 
football, any basketball. No ball, period. Now we can watch some NASCAR or 
maybe a little golf, but that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah? How come? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, let me ask you something," Jackson replies to an interviewer. "Would 
you want to go home and watch someone do interviews?" 
</P>
<P>
 The interviewer laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to be funny," Bo says. 
</P>
<P>
 What he means is, he needs to be doing something, not observing something. Bo 
Jackson is a doer. He has been keeping active in Arizona, working out, dropping 
10 pounds from his tummy and two inches from his waistline. Although he has 
always been a marvel of a physical specimen, real hip or fake, Jackson can go 
soft the same way anyone can without exercising at his usual pace. When asked 
what his training schedule consists of, he says: "It consists of working your 
buns off. Exercise, repetition and lots of sweatin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he might not be one of the usual Angels in the outfield, being 
prepared to play is Jackson's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to take someone's job," he says. "I'm a fourth outfielder. I 
will be in the outfield when one of the other outfielders aren't able or 
capable. I haven't come to the California Angels to try to be a quote-unquote 
savior. If there's a void, I'll try to fill it. But if the job belongs to 
somebody else, then I'll politely step aside and let them handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he can help. Maybe he can't. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi is curious himself. That's why he signed Jackson. That's why he says: 
"I'll tell you the only thing I know about Bo. If he sets his mind to do 
something, and if anybody bets against him, I would cover those bets."

CAROLINA DREAMING; GREAT THINGS ARE EXPECTED OF THE HORNETS, WHO FIND POTENTIAL 
CAN BE A BURDEN 
</P>

<P>
 A funny thing happened on the way to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 That was where the Hornets thought they were headed. They had admirers who 
said it was going to be this season, too -- including the New York Times, which 
predicted a Houston-Charlotte matchup. The Hornets now complain about media 
pressure, but the day the story ran, owner George Shinn was so happy, he 
brought the paper to practice to show everyone they had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson No. 1: It ain't that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Shinn's $84-million man, Larry Johnson, has injured his back and 
might wind up writing off the season. 
</P>
<P>
 His $25-million relative bargain, Alonzo 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning, has gone out because of knee, ankle and calf injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 They have all had to learn about living up to expectations. Time is still on 
their side, but it hasn't kicked in as fast as they had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "People saw this as an up-and-coming team, a team that could do some damage in 
the Eastern Conference, a team that played the Knicks as well as anyone, other 
than Chicago," said newly arrived veteran Eddie Johnson. "So the expectations 
weren't unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was, these guys didn't understand what those expectations were; 
and that when somebody projects you to be one of the top-echelon teams, that 
means you've got to exert extra energy because now teams expect you and they're 
going to come in and play harder. I think that's what happened to us early in 
the year against some teams. We expected just to roll the ball out and win, and 
those teams came out and played a heck of a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a struggle so far this year, but they're starting to understand 
that the better you become, the harder it is to win. People always think it's a 
breath of fresh air when you finish something. You finish high school and you 
hear all the stories about college and the partying and all that. But when you 
get to college, it's harder! And when you get out of college, you get into the 
real world, you think you can take a break and you find out it's extra hard. 
You've got to find a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's the same way with basketball. The better you are, the harder it is 
to keep achieving. And I think they're starting to understand that. It's not 
too late because it's early in the year." 
</P>
<P>
 There's an easy explanation of how the Hornets got so good so fast: luck. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the NBA's fifth-worst team in 1991, with seven of the 66 Ping-Pong 
balls when they drew the No. 1 slot in the draft lottery -- a 9-1 shot -- and 
got Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 They were eighth-worst in 1992, with four balls, when they came up No. 2 -- a 
16-1 shot -- and got Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, they had fallen over themselves like clumsy puppies. Shinn, a 
hyper-enthusiastic man who had worked his way up from janitor to millionaire, 
turned his years of being an Atlantic Coast Conference fan into injunctions to 
take the best Tar Heel, Blue Devil or Cavalier available. He bypassed his own 
front office to make the deal for Mike Gminski, who played at Duke. He urged 
the drafting of J.R. Reid of North Carolina. He yearned so for Ralph Sampson of 
Virginia that a Hornet official had to spend a week in Sacramento confirming 
that Sampson's knees were shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Having made better marketing decisions, Shinn had room for error. Charlotte 
fans, already crazy about college basketball, flocked to the state-of-the-art 
arena on Hive Drive. From Dec. 23, 1989, the night they beat the Bulls on a 
Kurt Rambis tip-in, the 23,698-seat arena, biggest in the NBA, has sold out, 
214 times through the end of January and counting. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 1990-91-92 drafts brought Kendall Gill, Johnson and Mourning, they 
had something to cheer for. The Hornets went up like a rocket, breathed 
rarefied air and became giddy. 
</P>
<P>
 They won their last five games last season and qualified for the playoffs for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 They ousted the Boston Celtics on Mourning's dramatic 20-footer in Game 4 and 
moved on to meet the Knicks. Anything but awed, the Hornets informed the Knicks 
they were their equals, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gill: "We have more talent than New York does. We just haven't put 
everything together like New York has to this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Muggsy Bogues: "You look at New York and you constantly wonder how they 
got 60 wins." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Knicks showed them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets had a 12-point lead in the first half in Game 1 at Madison Square 
Garden, but the Knicks outscored them, 31-15, in the fourth quarter and won. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot-tempered Hornet Coach Allan Bristow, resisting an invitation to compliment 
Pat Riley's superbly conditioned players, sputtered: "Wore down? Are you 
kidding me? He was playing our game! Ask them if they got worn down. They're 
the ones that aren't used to this pace."  
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets had a 13-point lead with 6:48 left in Game 2, but the Knicks shut 
them down again. Still unimpressed, Bristow sneered to reporters: "Their 
defense, I think it plays on your minds. We had the opportunities, we just 
didn't convert."  
</P>
<P>
 Sighed Doc Rivers: "That's Allan Bristow." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Charlotte, the Hornets won Game 3 in two overtimes. Johnson scored 31 
points and got so excited once, after making a shot, he just began jumping up 
and down on the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Knicks won Game 4 on 34-year-old Rolando Blackman's 20-foot shot with 
five seconds to play. They won Game 5 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Experience counts in postseason play, and the Hornets had just begun to get 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the Hornets traded Gill, who was threatening to become a free 
agent, but replaced him with Hersey Hawkins, less temperamental and a better 
shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinn then fired the shot heard 'round the league, signing Larry Johnson, who 
still had four years on his contract at $3 million a year, to an $84-million, 
10-year extension. General managers everywhere winced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was a sense of shock," Orlando's Pat Williams said. "I don't 
think anyone expected it. There was no warning. The question was, why then?" 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner David Stern asked Shinn if he realized he had just given one man 
more than twice the $32.5 million he paid for the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Hornets claim not to have heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The reaction) wasn't as great as you think it is," team President Spencer 
Stolpen said. "There's only one or two people who dared say it to my face, and 
when I explain it, every one of them seems to understand it. I think a lot of 
them are just jealous that they didn't have an owner and/or a player to put 
those two things together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were thinking that, one, we wanted to keep Larry here. We didn't want to 
go through the Gill situation. Two, with the collective bargaining agreement 
ending this year, we didn't want to play games with what the numbers were going 
to end up to be. Larry rolled the dice that he's not going to underprice 
himself over the next few years. We rolled the dice that he's going to be the 
player we think he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, I don't think any one of us regrets the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, actually, it's a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In a charity game in July, Johnson reached back for a tomahawk dunk and felt 
something pull in his back. It wasn't supposed to be serious, but when training 
camp started, Johnson's right leg was weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tried to go in training camp early and he couldn't, so we just gave him 
the four weeks off," Bristow said. "He hadn't been playing 100%, and then he 
re-injured it in the Detroit game right before Christmas. Whether this is 
related to the same injury they don't know, but it's certainly the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize, yeah, he can still occasionally get the big numbers, 
but he's not doing the explosive stuff that Larry did the last couple years. 
Yeah, he can battle his way into getting 29 points and 15 rebounds, but he's 
not ready to take Charles Barkley one on four and dunk over him. That's what he 
did his first couple years." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the Hornets had hoped that Johnson would return in December. Then in 
January. Now he is scheduled to be re-evaluated during the All-Star break this 
month amid speculation he might not be back before April. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I knew we could get Larry back at full strength in March," Bristow said, 
"I'd take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mourning had his own troubles. A knee injury cut short his training 
camp, after which he left the lineup because of a sprained ankle, then a 
bruised calf. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this season would be hard for them to beat, but the Hornets' best 
days do lie ahead. They have four veterans on the last year of their contracts. 
By renouncing them, they can duck under the salary cap and make a run at a free 
agent, Horace Grant, or, Shinn's dream, North Carolina native Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need some time," Stolpen said in the sunnier days when the Hornets 
thought Johnson would be back in a couple of weeks. No question another player, 
another big guy, would probably help. I think we're one piece away from not 
only a run, but a consistent long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge is to compete with ourselves. How do we keep getting better 
than we were? How do we stay there? I spend a lot of time trying to analyze 
what Boston did wrong, what the Lakers did wrong, what the Pistons did wrong. 
How do you stop that major fall after a long-term championship team? That's 
what I'm trying to figure out, and I don't have the answer yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is you probably have to trade someone who's still very productive 
to get you a chance to get somebody young. Boston probably could have traded 
Kevin McHale or Robert Parish four or five years ago and gotten talent to keep 
themselves going. And instead of trying to dump James Worthy in the last two 
years of his contract, if the Lakers had moved four years ago, they maybe could 
have gotten (some help) -- but I don't know. It's not easy to do. If it ever 
came that I had to move Larry, it'd be a tough decision." 
</P>
<P>
 But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Before the Hornets worry about the 
second dynasty, they will have to realize the first. It's fun to dream, and in 
Charlotte, it's still what they do best.

WHAT'S NEXT?; COWBOYS MADE MOVES THEY HAD TO MAKE TO WIN THIS SUPER BOWL, BUT 
TO WIN UNPRECEDENTED THREE IN A ROW, MORE MOVES ARE NECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The ending Sunday night was nothing short of glorious: men dressed in blue and 
silver walking across a field below cheering masses, taped fists pointed to the 
sky, eyes watering, flashbulbs popping. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith reminded everyone Monday that it began with a couch, a television 
set and an anxiety attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the perilousness of the Dallas Cowboys' seven-month journey, which 
culminated in their second consecutive NFL championship Sunday night. Nothing 
that looked so easy has ever been so hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was as difficult a year, in a good year, as I have ever been through," 
Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the masterpiece that was the Cowboys' season, their 30-13 victory over the 
Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVIII represented only the signature. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of the work was shaped throughout the fall and winter, by quick 
maneuvers and impulsive decisions that sometimes occurred far from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 This aggressiveness and ingenuity helped the Cowboys survive everything from 
football's most celebrated holdout to its most celebrated blooper. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't arrive at their place in history Sunday night at the Georgia Dome 
simply because they were pro football's best team. 
</P>
<P>
 By leaps and bounds, they are also its best organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody around here is in agreement that we do whatever it takes," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They lost Smith for the first two games of the season because of a holdout 
. . . but re-signed him one breath before disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Both games were unpleasant defeats, both watched by Smith on television at his 
home in Pensacola, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Cowboys fell to 0-2, Smith saw a televised shot of the hole that 
frustrated teammate Charles Haley had placed in a locker room wall with his 
helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 He then saw Johnson give an interview and noticed how red his face looked. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, he signed a $13.6-million contract that could have been 
considerably bigger if he had waited longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw what happened on TV, I knew then I had to get in there to relieve 
the tension," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if he had sold himself short, he quickly answered: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Five months later, he became only the fourth player to win both the NFL and 
Super Bowl MVP awards in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Johnson suddenly, angrily fired popular kicker Lin Elliott after two games 
and two missed field goals . . . but quickly hired veteran Eddie Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray is notoriously weak on kickoffs, but Johnson didn't care. He simply 
hired faster special teams players -- Elvis Patterson and Joe Fishback -- on 
Murray's flanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray kicked 28 field goals in 33 tries during the regular season and was six 
for six in the playoffs, including three Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cowboys lost a Thanksgiving game to the Miami Dolphins when Leon Lett 
touched a blocked field goal and gave the Dolphins another chance, which they 
converted for a victory that damaged Dallas' divisional title hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Johnson saw Lett weeping on the trainer's table afterward, he 
consoled him. Later,he said Lett would be a Cowboy as long as Johnson was the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Lett made perhaps the play of the game by stripping the ball from 
Thurman Thomas, leading to a 46-yard fumble return for a touchdown by teammate 
James Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I say some of the things I do," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman was on the sideline because of a hamstring 
injury . . . so Johnson signed Bernie Kosar two days after he was released by 
the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins needed Kosar more then the Cowboys, and wooed him first. 
</P>
<P>
 But when owner Jerry Jones threw $1 million at Kosar for half a season, 
Johnson promised Kosar he could play in his first game as a Cowboy and for as 
long as Aikman was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days after joining the team, Kosar led the Cowboys to touchdowns on his 
first two drives in a victory over the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, he threw the game-clinching touchdown pass in the NFC 
championship game against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People thought we overpaid for Bernie, but look what he did for us," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With a home-field advantage in the playoffs on the line against the New 
York Giants in the final game of the season, Smith separated his shoulder in 
the first half . . . but Johnson allowed him to play the rest of the game and 
in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith gained 78 yards after the injury -- 229 yards counting rushing and 
receiving -- in the most courageous performance by a player this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys won on Murray's field goal and were never threatened in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it comes down to the bottom line," Johnson said. "We can't be 
thinking about shoulders and backs and hamstrings. As a team, we have to look 
for that bottom line, and that is winning when you have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Of bottom lines, Monday's news conference was only 11 minutes old when 
somebody -- it was Smith -- first mentioned three-peat . 
</P>
<P>
 Can the Cowboys become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive 
Super Bowl championships? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to try to keep this team together," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys will have 19 unrestricted free agents, including starting 
offensive linemen Nate Newton, Mark Stepnoski, John Gesek and Kevin Gogan. 
Fullback Daryl Johnston is alsofree. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the advance payments made in contracts given to Smith and Aikman, 
there should be room under the salary cap to keep the team intact. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones can also expect that Michael Irvin, scheduled to make $1.17 million 
next year, will threaten to stay out if he does not get a new deal worth at 
least $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And even Smith said he would not rule out a renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows, maybe Jerry will come to me now," Smith said. "Maybe we'll see a 
side of Jerry that nobody knows." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson agrees. He said Monday that, instead of following the recent Cowboy 
tradition of outfoxing the league in the draft, his coaches were going to 
concentrate on free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 With no rules stopping them from signing as many top free agents as possible, 
look for Johnson to seek a pass rusher -- possibly Clyde Simmons -- and some 
offensive linemen to replace any he loses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not hesitate to bring someone in here to upgrade us," Johnson said. 
"We will not close the door on any top player." 
</P>
<P>
 He will also be looking for an offensive coordinator to replace Norv Turner, 
who is expected to become head coach of the Washington Redskins this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think we'll score a touchdown or two next year," Johnson said, already 
throwing in a dig even before Turner leaves the building. "Norv is a great 
coach . . . but we do have eight Pro Bowl players on our offense." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about Johnson staying with the Cowboys? He repeated that he was happy 
in Dallas, for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any thoughts right now about doing anything else," Johnson said. 
"But it's never 100% that I'll do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 12 hours after the hugs between Johnson and Jones, they are 
disagreeing again. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones wants to accept President Clinton's invitation to visit the White House. 
Johnson wants to flee to his boat off the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry wants to go. . . . I'll do what I have to do," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He can at least be pleased that the only thing a national TV audience saw more 
than Emmitt Smith last weekend was the commercial in which Johnson and several 
players drive past Jones on their way to Atlanta, leaving him choking on dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a fun commercial, and it was Jerry who had the idea that we not pick 
him up," Johnson said, smiling. "I guess he wanted to make it as realistic as 
possible."

DUKE IS LATEST NO. 1 IN AP POLL; UCLA FALLS TO NO. 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A familiar name was atop the Associated Press college basketball rankings 
Monday as Duke became the sixth school to hold the No. 1 spot this season. It 
was the fifth consecutive poll with a different team on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously No. 1 UCLA, the last undefeated Division I team, dropped to No. 4 
after falling to California on Sunday, 85-70. The Bears (12-4), ranked sixth in 
the preseason, returned to the rankings at No. 19 after a one-week absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke (15-1) reached No. 1 for the third season in a row, and the Blue Devils' 
first game with the top ranking will be Thursday night at No. 2 North Carolina. 
It will be the first 1-2 matchup since top-ranked Nevada Las Vegas defeated 
Arkansas, 112-105, on Feb. 10, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be a good Duke team, but not as good as the ones that 
made the Final Four part of their regular schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very surprised," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said Monday. "I think that 
going into the year we had a lot of questions about our group and midway 
through the year we still have a lot of questions. I've had opportunities to 
coach teams that have been No. 1 before and this team is very much a developing 
team. We think it is an honor to be voted No. 1 at any time because you may 
never be voted No. 1 again."

EX-CUB SMITH OKS ONE-YEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While he doesn't have the glamour or magnetism of Bo Jackson, the Angels 
grabbed another candidate for their left field job Monday when they reached 
agreement with free agent Dwight Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith will sign a one-year contract for about $700,000, according to sources, 
and be placed on the 40-man roster. The Angels are expected to make the 
announcement today. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 30, batted .300 for the Cubs last season with a career-high 11 homer 
runs. Smith, runner-up for the 1989 National League rookie of the year award, 
holds the Cubs' all-time record with 50 pinch-hits in his five-year career. BOB

JACKSON: JUST THE ANGELS' FOURTH OUTFIELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was designed to be a news conference, but the moment he walked through the 
door Monday afternoon, the Angels knew their entire image suddenly had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been years since they had this feeling, but for the first time since 
the Angels last had a Jackson on the field, they now have an identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie was the one responsible for delivering glamour and sex appeal to the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bo is bringing it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really never understood that magnetism he had," Angel General Manager Bill 
Bavasi said, "until today. It was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Edward Jackson, whom the world simply calls, "Bo," charmed, teased and 
mesmerized reporters and photographers for nearly an hour at Anaheim Stadium. 
It was the Angels' best-attended news conference since Reggie Jackson signed as 
a free agent in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 100 people, including 12 television crews. The Angels' entire 
front office was there, no one willing to miss the moment 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson warned the assemblage that he's not a franchise savior. He even called 
himself a fourth outfielder, who wasn't trying to cost anyone a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it didn't matter. This is a guy who transcended two sports before Deion 
Sanders ever entertained the notion. This is a guy who is playing with an 
artificial hip, knowing it could break at any time. This is charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who acknowledge that Jackson will be an instant gate attraction -- 
but claim it is not the sole reason they signed him -- believe this will be a 
cozy arrangement. Jackson will be paid $1 million if he makes the opening-day 
roster. If he's cut in spring training, they Angels are responsible for only 
$300,000. Jackson can earn $2.2 million if he plays in 130 games, receiving a 
$200,000 bonus for every 10 games he plays beginning with the 80th and ending 
with the 130th. 
</P>
<P>
 "My role is to play where I'm needed," Jackson said. "I'm just here to be part 
of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 While Jackson was talking as smoothly as a politician, he wasn't fooling 
anyone. He's not coming to California simply to be close to Hollywood. He wants 
to play, whether it will be as the Angels' starting left fielder or as their 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what he said," Bavasi said, "but I can't believe he goes back to 
Phoenix and works out just to be a fourth outfielder. No way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels already have a full-time DH in Chili Davis, who hit 27 homers and 
drove in 112 runs last season. They also have viable left fielders in Eduardo 
Perez and free agent Dwight Smith, who reached a tentative agreement Monday on 
a one-year contract, according to a knowledgeable source. 
</P>
<P>
 Any possible conflict could be resolved by trading Davis, who is guaranteed 
$2.4 million and could earn $3.05 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no sacred cows here," Bavasi said. "This gives us flexibility."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying we're signing the same Bo Jackson. I mean, we wouldn't even be 
having this conversation if he had stayed away from football."  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has spent his entire professional career thwarting those who doubted 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 They said he would never play major league baseball after winning the Heisman 
Trophy in 1985. He was playing for the Kansas City Royals eight months later. 
</P>
<P>
 They said it was impossible to play two professional sports. Jackson was 
playing for the Raiders and Royals in 1987, earning All-Star and Pro Bowl 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
 They said he was finished after undergoing hip replacement surgery in 1992. He 
hit a home run in his first at-bat of the 1993 season for the Chicago White 
Sox, hitting .232 with 16 homers and 45 RBIs in 85 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "People told me I'd never amount to anything growing up," Jackson said. "All I 
can say is, 'Look at me now, baby, look at me now.' " Bo Jackson's Statistics

CHAMINADE'S SAUNDERS COMMITS TO HAWAII

 Franklin Saunders, a running back from Chaminade, who suffered a season-ending 
knee injury early in the season, has made an oral commitment to play at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders began the season as one of the top running backs in the Valley.On his 
first carry of the Eagles' fifth game, he suffered a torn anterior cruciate 
ligament in his right knee, ending his season. Saunders, who finished with 744 
yards in 108 carries, underwent surgery Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hawaii's) trainer was very impressed with how well it's come along," 
Saunders said. "I don't have a limp at all. When I'm wearing long pants, people 
can't even tell I've had surgery and some people who knew I had surgery 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders took a trip to Hawaii last weekend. He said he chose the Rainbows 
over Washington State and San Jose State because he believed he had the best 
chance to play right away and he was attracted to that school's pre-med 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course the location is beautiful," he said. "I can't really explain the 
feeling I got (during the visit), you just know it's there." JEFF FLETCHER

SYLMAR RUNNING BACK CRENSHAW OPTS TO PLAY FOR MICHIGAN STATE; RECRUITING: 
CHAMINADE'S SAUNDERS COMMITS TO HAWAII AND CANYON'S WILLIAMS SELECTS ST. 
MARY'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Running back Tyrone Crenshaw, Sylmar High's two-time City Section 4-A Division 
player of the year, has orally committed to play football for Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, who averaged 8.3 yards a carry in three seasons at Sylmar and led 
the Spartans to a 4-A championship title in 1992, said he will sign a letter of 
intent Wednesday, the first day of the early signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'll be a Spartan for life -- or at least another four or five 
years," Crenshaw joked. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-11, 180-pound tailback also took recruiting trips to California, 
Arizona State and Oklahoma and canceled a trip to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason I like the Big Ten better than the Pac-10," Crenshaw said. 
"There's a lot more tradition. They have a lot more money. They're more 
established." 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining a running back in college was Crenshaw's top priority. He was not 
willing to convert to defensive back, which many college coaches had desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being slowed by an ankle injury for the better part of his junior and 
senior seasons, Crenshaw was one of the country's top recruits, garnering 
several national and state accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 He led area City rushers for the second consecutive season with 1,785 yards 
and 23 touchdowns. As a junior, Crenshaw rushed for 1,875 yards and 22 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, Michigan State's sole running back recruit, has not yet earned a 
minimum requirement score of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.  
</P>
<P>
 He took the test last month and is awaiting the results. The Michigan State 
scholarship offer is contingent on Crenshaw's scoring 700 or better, but 
Crenshaw isn't worried. He is already gearing up for the brisk winter chill of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I got to get used to is the cold weather," Crenshaw said. "I 
won't be stepping out a lot, I'll tell you that -- I'll be in my dorm room or 
in class, that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw was impressed with the campus, athletic facilities and academic 
support staff at Michigan State, but is most inspired by the thought of playing 
against one of his idols, Michigan running back Tyrone Wheatley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to see him play (in person)," Crenshaw said. "I love the 
way he runs. I guess I'm going to join my idol in the Big 10." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Canyon High running back Ed Williams has made an oral commitment to St. Mary's 
after considering Trinity College of Chicago and the Army Academy.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite nagging injuries through most of his senior season, Williams rushed 
for 1,081 yards and averaged 7.35 yards per carry. He also caught 20 passes for 
251 yards and scored 20 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Gaels) haven't promised me anything, but they say I have a chance to 
play next year," Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 "St. Mary's was pretty much my first choice, and it was a matter of money. 
They're giving me almost a full scholarship, and they only give partials 
there." Times' Top 20 Basketball Polls

RECORD 134.8 MILLION VIEWERS WATCH SUPER BOWL; RATING IS 45.4 
</P>

 NBC's coverage of Sunday's Super Bowl XXVIII drew the most U.S. viewers of any 
sponsored television program and recorded a slight ratings increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecast of the Dallas Cowboys' 30-13 victory over the Bills in Atlanta's 
Georgia Dome was seen by more than 134.8 million viewers and drew a 45.4 rating 
and a 66% share of the total television audience, according to the A.C. Nielsen 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's game had a 45.1 rating, 66% of the total television audience and a 
then-record audience of 133.4 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's rating is the 10th-highest of all time and the highest for a Super 
Bowl since CBS earned a 45.8 for Super Bowl XXI between the Denver Broncos and 
New York Giants in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS' coverage of Super Bowl XVI in 1982 between the Cincinnati Bengals and San 
Francisco 49ers remains the ratings leader with a 49.1. The discrepancy between 
ratings and viewership records is because of the increase in population. STEVEN

SINGLES CHECK POTENTIAL MATE TO AVOID BECOMING A PAWN; RELATIONSHIPS: MORE O.C. 
WOMEN, AND SOME MEN, ARE INVESTIGATING BACKGROUNDS TO MAKE SURE A MATCH IS NOT 
JUST A GAME. 
</P>

 In 1992, Anna -- a divorced Orange County management consultant -- started a 
serious relationship with a high-powered executive she'd met five years earlier 
at the Balboa Bay Club. Nine months later, she found out he was married to a 
Los Angeles woman. 
</P>
<P>
 He presented himself as a successful, single businessman who traveled a lot, 
recalls Anna, who last year told her story on CNN's "Sonya Live" talk show. "He 
stayed at my home, took me on trips, and his secretaries knew me. I was furious 
when I finally found out he was married." 
</P>
<P>
 It's love-is-blind experiences like this that are prompting more and more 
women -- and some men -- to check out their dates, often before investing any 
time or emotion in a potential romance. They may hire professional 
investigators or conduct do-it-yourself gumshoe projects using sleuthing guides 
such as books or videotapes to learn how to legally access a myriad of public 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowledge is power," says Anna over a pancake breakfast at a Newport Beach 
eatery. "If I'd known then the information resources available to me as a 
financially struggling single parent, I could have saved myself a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna, who asked that her real name not be used in this story, says she'd 
suspected her paramour might be married but every time she voiced those fears, 
both he and her friends told her she was "just paranoid." Still, about three 
months into the relationship, she asked her attorney to run a check on the 
man's property to see if there was a wife listed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That cost me about $22, and it came up clean," recalls Anna. "So I just 
figured that yes, I was being paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
 The ax fell, Anna says, when one weekend she was unable to reach the man on 
the cellular phone that he carried in his briefcase. She pulled out the 
property check report to get an address and dialed information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just did it out of frustration," she says. "I never dreamed I would get a 
listing, but the operator gave me one for a husband and wife." 
</P>
<P>
 She called the wife, introduced herself and said: "(Not knowing he was 
married), I have been sleeping with your husband for the past nine months." 
After a long conversation with the wife (learning among other things that the 
woman's husband had even brought her lemons from Anna's back yard), Anna called 
the man and confronted him. He hung up on her. They never spoke again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt betrayed, but at least I knew my intuitions had been correct," says 
Anna, adding that in the future she will hire professionals to investigate any 
man she's serious about. She sighs. "I'm an intelligent person," she says. "I 
own my own company. I did my homework the best I knew how. It can happen to 
anyone." 
</P>

 Pat Rutherford sits in his cramped San Clemente office, the wall behind him 
slathered with photographs of people he's found. Much of his business, called 
Worldwide Tracers, is tracking the missing, but an increasing number of cases 
-- about 20 a month -- involve surreptitious background checks for love. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very common now to check out your man," says Rutherford, 66. 
"Unfortunately, too many people think about it too late. They're in so far and 
then it's 'Oh, my God!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford says 90% of his clients are women, because it's usually women who 
are conned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lead with their hearts and want to believe even though they sense 
something isn't quite right," he says. "Ladies have a sixth sense about these 
things, but some of the mistakes they make make you want to cry. I do a lot of 
counseling to hurting women." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford's first such case about four years ago involved a woman who was 
leery of her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "She called him Mr. Wonderful," recalls Rutherford. "He swept her off her feet 
and did everything for her except for one thing: He wouldn't give her his 
address or phone number. I checked him out and guess what? Mr. Wonderful had a 
family. Mr. Wonderful was not so wonderful at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford, who employs seven investigators -- most of whom are female -- says 
any detective will say he or she can do date checks, but not all do a good job, 
and many charge a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Rutherford: "Most of our clients are not rich people. So if you say '$50 
an hour and I need up front six or seven hours pay,' God, a person can spend a 
fortune."  
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide Tracers charges a flat date check fee of $200. That price includes 
computer checks for criminal convictions; property ownership; bankruptcies; 
county, state and federal tax liens; small civil claims; judgments; notices of 
defaults; drunk driving convictions; date of birth and name verification; a 
listing of family members at same address; marriages and divorces, and 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic check also includes a "sting," whereby investigators pretend to be 
someone else to gain information from neighbors, employers, ex-wives or the 
investigated parties themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone can run a computer check," Rutherford says. "But you gotta be in the 
right databanks and even so, that often that doesn't tell you enough. That's 
where the sting comes in. You'd be amazed at what we can find out through 
stings." 
</P>
<P>
 The stings are also fun for the investigator, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're licensed to lie," says Rutherford with a laugh, adding that the only 
people investigators can't claim to be are police, state or government 
officials. "That's the fun part. It's like being a 7-year-old playing games." 
</P>
<P>
 After the basic check, some clients -- about 20% -- elect to have the parties 
followed, but Rutherford, who charges $35 per hour for surveillance, says he 
tries to discourage that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say 'look, you already found out he's a jerk, why put any more money into 
it?' Like in (Alcoholics Anonymous), you just gotta get rid of what's killing 
you." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Tom Lawson stands by the window in his Newport Beach office. The founder of 
Apscreen, a consumer reporting agency that since 1980 has performed hundreds of 
thousands of background checks for businesses, says his firm about four years 
ago officially expanded into the personal realm and now does about 300 
"sweetheart checks" annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a cloak-and-dagger private investigations firm," Lawson says. "We 
don't chase cheating (men), and we don't carry guns. We're a research company 
whose ethics come from a different plane." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson says Southern California is the "fraud capital of the world," and 
sweetheart checks are the "hot new thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more people are going into this, but they're less and less 
qualified," Lawson says. "With a computer, you can access what appears to be a 
world of information, but database information is at best a spot-check tool, 
not a definitive search. People can be sold a bill of goods." 
</P>
<P>
 Individual sweetheart services, such as a criminal or a property ownership 
check, cost from $12.50 to $50. But most people take the package deal for $300, 
which includes criminal and litigation histories (including divorces); asset 
discoveries; liabilities such as tax liens, judgments, evictions, defaults and 
foreclosures; business involvements and financial encumbrances; license, 
address, Social Security number and name verification; a media check, and 
marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson says the best sweetheart check is done with the consent of the person 
being investigated. (About 20% of his clients do obtain written consent.) He 
cautions against unscrupulous detectives whom he says sometimes do illegal 
things that violate a person's legal privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, you need to go into a relationship with your eyes open and 
with enough self-confidence to tell the person you want to know more about 
them," Lawson says. "If they do have something to hide, they could respond 
adversely, which tells you something right there. Then again they could respond 
without concern, not thinking you can find what they're hiding." 
</P>
<P>
 Without consent, Lawson says, certain records -- such as insurance files and 
credit reports -- cannot be legally obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beware of people who tell you you can get anything without consent," Lawson 
says. "The industry is plagued by that." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Lawson's clients is Sharon, 30, who also asked that her real name not 
be used. Speaking by telephone, the stock analyst says she last year attended a 
white-collar crime seminar that included a discussion of all the ways anyone 
can gain information from public records. Her interest was particularly piqued, 
she says, because for six months she'd been dating a man she wasn't sure had 
been truthful with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He professed to be doing so well in the business world, but he never took me 
to his office or introduced me to his employees," she recalls. "I thought that 
was awfully odd. And things just didn't make sense in general: I just couldn't 
get all the pieces of the puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
 Her fear, Sharon says, was that her man may have been doing something illegal. 
She also worried that he might not be who he said he was or that perhaps there 
was a history of abuse. Not wanting to take the time to stand in line to obtain 
public records herself and not wanting to sign her name on any requests to 
obtain those records, she hired Apscreen to investigate for her. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: The man had told her some minor business fabrications, but there 
was no adverse information in his divorce, property or criminal files. Still, 
six months later she broke up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "These checks can give you a feel for if there's something drastically wrong, 
but they're not a catch-all insight into personality traits," she says. "I 
still felt like there was something really wrong, and in the end you still have 
to go with your gut." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, her gut was correct. After she left him, the man threatened her. 
She took him to court and won a restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next time some woman checks him out," Sharon says, "there will be 
something there to find."

<P>
 John and Donna Crean opened their Tara-inspired mansion in Santa Ana Heights 
to about 200 guests for a lavish Super Bowl party that even featured a live 
halftime performance by the Newport Harbor High School Sailor Band. Guests paid 
$100 each to attend the party and silent auction, netting about $25,000 for the 
Juvenile Connection Program, part of the Orange-based Coalition for Children, 
Adolescents and Parents (C-CAP). 
</P>
<P>
 Armchair Quarterbacks 
</P>
<P>
 The Village Crean was equipped with everything but a football field for the 
big game. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure everyone had a good view of the showdown between the Dallas 
Cowboys and Buffalo Bills, the Creans set up a dozen big-screen televisions 
throughout the premises. A mini-theater equipped with several dozen easy chairs 
and a massive TV screen was reserved for serious football fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "What better place to watch the Super Bowl?" asked Lynne Tsuda, event 
co-chairwoman and soon-to-be-disappointed Buffalo Bills fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vendors" roamed the mansion passing out bags of popcorn and hot pretzels. 
Guests lined up in the back yard for burgers, hot dogs and other standard 
stadium fare. Throughout the day they visited a dessert table decorated like a 
football field and piled high with cookies and football-shaped brownies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the celebrities attending was the Creans' longtime friend Sandra Gould, 
who played nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz on the '60s TV series "Bewitched." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever I go, people recognize me," Gould said. "I'm dubbed in Japanese, and 
when I was in Japan shooting a commercial they all came up to me and started 
talking in Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, a Studio City resident, sported sunglasses with one lens missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake broke six pairs of my glasses," she said. "We lost a lot. I'm 
going to need another series." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping Families at Risk 
</P>
<P>
 For the Creans, throwing a Super Bowl party for their friends is an annual 
tradition, but four years ago they decided to turn it into a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "C-CAP needed a fund-raiser, and my husband had been saying for several years 
that he didn't understand why some charity didn't snap up the Super Bowl 
party," said event chairwoman Donna Crean, who hosts numerous charity events at 
her home each year. "Now we invite our friends and ask them to pay."  
</P>
<P>
 The coalition offers educational programs to help prevent unintended 
adolescent pregnancy in Orange County. Proceeds from the party were earmarked 
for C-CAP's Juvenile Connection Program, which provides an assessment and 
referral service to families in crisis. The program's goal is to keep children 
from engaging in "at-risk behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be as simple as taking a child to one of our dermatologists for 
tattoo removal to get him away from the gang influence or as severe as 
counseling a teen who is suicidal," says Rowene Medina, board president of 
C-CAP. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition can refer clients to more than 250 providers, including 
dentists, doctors and counselors, who offer services to the needy families for 
free or for reduced fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea of C-CAP is you can't just treat the child, you have to treat 
the whole family," Medina said. "We try to take care of the problem before the 
child ends up in juvenile detention." 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests were: Cynthia Scheinberg, executive director of C-CAP; Lee and 
Kathleen Goldberg, vice president of C-CAP; Michael Schumacher, C-CAP board 
member and Orange County Probation chief; actor Richard Moll, formerly of 
"Night Court," and his wife, Susan; Buzz and Lois Aldrin; Andy Crean; Don and 
Patricia Boortz; Yen Ngoc Do; Hiangkie Han; Michael and Grace Gatti; Joe and 
Linda Martin, and Jay and Maryjane Palchikoff. KATHRYN BOLD

O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; NEWPORT HARBOR: THE BOOM YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Kevin Consey arrived in September of 1983 to begin his term as director 
of Newport Harbor, museum supporters were hungry for strong leadership, a 
quality they didn't perceive in former director Kathleen Gallander. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tender age of 31, Consey had already been a museum director for six 
years, first at the Emily Lowe Gallery at Hofstra University in New York, his 
alma mater, and subsequently at the San Antonio Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling his decision to come to Newport Harbor, Consey once said it was the 
museum's potential that attracted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing played a role, too. In the late '70s and early '80s, the museum was 
wrestling with the issue of whether it was a volunteer or professional 
organization, Consey said. But by the time he arrived, the issue had been 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trustees were accepting the fact that they had to invest more confidence 
in the director and the professional staff because they couldn't stand to lose 
a director very quickly again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A big bear of a man with a stern profile -- you could easily imagine him a 
Renaissance courtly portrait -- Consey cultivated a stiff, even pompous manner 
in public, perhaps to mask his comparative youth. Discussing his relationship 
to museum staff, he would invoke the phrase "dispassionate distance." 
</P>
<P>
 But in private, he was a feisty conversationalist with a dark sense of humor 
-- he once lent this writer a tongue-in-cheek book picturing "road kills" -- 
and a warm heart. Hours after a memorial service for Betty Winkler, one of the 
museum's founders, he was still visibly shaken as he presided over an 
exhibition opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important to the museum, however, was his belief that a capable staff 
performs best without directorial interference. 
</P>
<P>
 When Consey arrived, Schimmel had been chief curator for two years, Ellen 
Breitman was in charge of education, and Richard Tellinghuisen headed museum 
operations. In short order, Consey assembled the remainder of an unusually 
able, committed and congenial staff that numbered more than three dozen in the 
mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good period for both of us," Schimmel -- who is now chief curator at 
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles -- recalled recently. "While he 
was focused on building a new institution, I was charged with . . . bringing 
the level of Newport's programming up to what would be suitable for a new 
world-class facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin saw what I had initiated with 'Action/Precision' (the first of three 
major exhibitions investigating aspects of Abstract Expressionism) before his 
arrival -- it was completed under him -- as being an important direction from a 
scholarly standpoint. He pushed for that kind of program -- looking at the 
history of American art -- and he continued to embrace the longstanding 
tradition of the institution's involvement in California art." 
</P>
<P>
 During Consey's first year, the museum's chronic financial problems were his 
biggest headache. When he arrived, the deficit was about $59,000, almost 10% of 
the annual operating budget of $600,000. A year later, the deficit was history 
and the budget had shot past $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consey achieved this coup with an aggressive pursuit of the business 
community, despite heavy competition from the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center building campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically used the strategy that we had a proven product, a history, and 
the Performing Arts Center had none," Consey said. "If you're going to fund a 
center based on promise, you should be willing to fund an art museum based on a 
clear record of service and performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Major gifts to the museum during Consey's tenure included a $300,000 National 
Endowment Challenge Grant, $250,000 from the Harry and Grace Steele Foundation, 
and a 10-year, $1-million exhibition grant from the Irvine Co. -- a windfall 
that, in retrospect, may have marked the beginning of a costly form of 
indentured servitude. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Riding high on his financial success during a period of major economic growth 
in Orange County, Consey immediately began planning to expand the museum, 
housed in a 23,000-square-foot building in Fashion Island that no longer seemed 
adequate to show off the permanent collection as well as traveling exhibitions. 
In 1987, Consey commissioned a feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the green light, the museum's building committee set about identifying a 
short list of internationally known architects, including Mexico's esteemed 
Ricardo Legoretta and Italy's Renzo Piano, who designed the Menil Collection 
museum in Houston and the Pompideau Centre in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board of trustees, which I had always heard was so difficult and 
controlling in terms of their own agenda," Consey says, "(was) for the vast 
time I was there extremely supportive and willing to make changes to bring 
greater recognition to the institution." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Consey was not to get his building. The museum board fired Piano in July, 
1990 -- eight months after Consey resigned to become director of the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Chicago, where he remains today. By early 1992, the economy 
had hit the skids and the whole project was axed. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Consey remains highly circumspect about his relationship with Irvine 
Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren, and though some deny it, persistent rumblings 
indicate that the developer's wishes were a key factor in plans for the 
10.5-acre parcel he donated at south Pacific Coast Highway and MacArthur 
Boulevard. (The $15-million building -- soon re-budgeted at $20 million -- also 
involved raising a $20-million endowment.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bren, a museum board member famous for his unwillingness to make public 
statements, never commented publicly on the design. Yet, sources say, when 
Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Thomas H. Nielsen was appointed board president in 
June, 1989, the balance of power in the museum "family" can be said to have 
shifted decisively toward the development company executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Piano's earliest schematic designs featured a wave-like series of roofs on six 
long structures ("fingers") linked by a glass "street." By August, 1989, when 
the 75,000-square-foot plan was unveiled to the public, the fingers were stuck 
together compactly and the wave roofs were replaced by a single, barrel-vaulted 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Piano later told a reporter, Bren was "quite persistent" that the finger 
design was too open and too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous other difficulties and disagreements -- to be discussed later 
in this series -- the museum fired Piano. By then, Consey had been in Chicago 
for the better part of a year. He bridles when asked about the belief -- held 
by some museum supporters -- that the plan lacked sufficient board enthusiasm 
during his directorship. 
</P>
<P>
 That notion is, he says, "a remarkable bit of revisionist history. . . . 
Hiring Mr. Piano, the conceptual plan, design and development -- every aspect 
was approved by the board for the almost three years I was involved. For 
someone (after I left) to decide it's too expensive (is like saying), 'We 
didn't know what we were doing for three years; we were hoodwinked by a 
silver-tongued devil.' "

FOLLOW-UP; HIV-POSITIVE ACTOR GETS CASTING CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lee Mathis has just shaved his head, a step he had been contemplating for a 
long time but lacked the courage to take. Advertising himself as an 
HIV-positive actor who needed work to qualify for union health coverage 
bolstered his resolve not to pull punches -- as did the outpouring of concern 
in its wake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was stopped in grocery stores, at the gym, the dentist, by friends and 
strangers alike -- people wishing me luck, saying, 'Way to go,' " says Mathis, 
whose plight was profiled in a recent Los Angeles Times article. "After the 
story, I was asked to appear on a couple of local TV news shows. Two national 
gay magazines wrote me up. The success of my campaign made me braver, 
determined not to put anything off." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news, the 41-year-old actor reports, is that he exceeded the amount 
necessary for Screen Actors Guild health insurance -- by $44.36. And the bad 
news? There was a three-month waiting period before the coverage kicked in -- a 
risky situation for anyone, let alone someone whose immune system is in 
disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis, a dancer-turned-actor who bartends part time, enlisted the help of the 
Actors' Fund of America -- an organization created to assist performers in 
crisis. After hearing his case, the group agreed to pay the $690 needed to 
cover him until April. Pride prevented him from accepting help from John Sousa, 
a Long Beach-based actor who had contacted SAG the day the newspaper story ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Sousa, who runs a window covering concern to make ends meet, had offered to 
pay the union $2,400 -- the difference between Mathis' earnings and the amount 
needed to qualify for health insurance. Informed that SAG income is the sole 
criteria for coverage, Sousa volunteered to reimburse any production company 
using Mathis' services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I had a gall bladder/appendix operation which left me $32,000 in 
the hole," says Sousa, 41, "and I know how hard it is to get work as an actor. 
Though I'm not gay, I have tremendous compassion for people in Mathis' 
position. If you have cancer, everyone's there for you. If you have AIDS -- or 
even announce that you're HIV-positive -- you're treated like a leper. This 
isn't a gay issue but a human one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pierre David, producer of "Open Fire," an action feature on which Mathis had 
worked in October, evidently thought so. After reading about Mathis, he placed 
a call to the actor asking if he was available for a night of "pickups" 
(fine-tuning a movie for editing purposes). Four hundred and fifty-five dollars 
from that gig, plus an extra day's pay when a job on TV's "Lois & Clark" was 
abruptly postponed nudged the actor toward his goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the nearly $2,000 from "Murder in the First" -- a Warner Bros. feature 
cast by Mary Jo Slater -- however, that pushed Mathis over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mary Jo had lined me up for a day's work but managed to extend the job to a 
week," says Mathis. "The thought of total strangers reaching out to me leaves 
me totally overwhelmed. Mary Jo is truly my guardian angel." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis got a running start toward qualifying for his 1994 insurance when 
casting director Tracy Lilienfield, who had been trading calls with the actor 
since the newspaper story appeared, hired him to play a paramedic on HBO's 
"Dream On." Slater also cast him as a fighter pilot for an episode of "Babylon 
5," a syndicated sci-fi series that premiered last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ("Babylon") part requires me to wear a helmet, so you don't see my head," 
says Mathis, who was hired a half hour after he read for the role. "That's 
probably a good thing since I've decided to grow my hair back. My hair is now 
at the 'baby bird' stage and, despite my newfound abandon, I feel more than a 
little silly." 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS-related death of a producer friend last weekend, however, put things 
in perspective. "You can never relax and take a deep breath," says Mathis. 
"Just like with the earthquake, the tremors keep coming."

SOAP ACTRESS WON'T QUIT HER DAY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many daytime drama actors dream of working on a prime-time series and leaving 
the soap-opera world behind. Not Victoria Rowell. She landed a job with Dick 
Van Dyke in CBS' Friday night mystery "Diagnosis Murder" but kept her job in 
the network sudser "The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy at 'Young and the Restless,' " she said emphatically during a 
recent interview at a Westside restaurant. "I don't see the soap as a vehicle 
or a step into stardom or features. To me, it's all one process. Work is work." 
</P>
<P>
 And work she does. Besides the daytime and nighttime series, Rowell dabbles in 
feature films, fulfills duties as Oil of Olay spokesperson, promotes her Rowell 
Foster Children's Scholarship Fund, keeps up her classical ballet work and is a 
single mother to 4-year-old Maya.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like my whole life was a preparation for this (kind of schedule)," 
she said. "My foster mother was an amazing woman. She was a self-sufficient 
widow who had already raised 10 of her own children. When she had the three of 
us, she was a senior citizen. She also ran a 60-acre farm." Rowell tries to 
emulate that energy for accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really say there is a recipe for how I get things done, but I have a 
couple of calendars, my Filofax is always close at hand and I have wonderful 
people helping me," Rowell said.  
</P>
<P>
 On the acting end, producers from each show coordinate her schedule to make 
sure there aren't any overlaps. On the personal side, she shares a personal 
assistant with actress Lee Purcell and has part-time help at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got a great disposition," observes Nancy Bradley Wiard, coordinating 
producer for "The Young and the Restless." "It's phenomenal that she can keep 
her characters straight while maintaining a wonderful sense of humor, be a good 
mother to Maya and have a regular life." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Steinberg, supervising producer of "Diagnosis Murder," agrees. "It's 
amazing how she finishes up on 'Y&R' and gets in her car and drives herself to 
'Diagnosis Murder' and can rush through makeup and be Amanda," he said. "I 
think she's just enjoying it so much and wants to do it so much that she just 
does it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," Rowell says, noting that she's always done other projects while 
working on the soap ("Distinguished Gentleman," HBO's "Full Eclipse" and many 
television guest-starring roles) and hopes to continue to do so. She also seems 
to be good at it: Rowell recently was named best daytime actress at the NAACP 
Image Awards, and on Friday she'll find out whether she's won in the best 
scene-stealer category on the "Soap Opera Digest Awards" on NBC.  
</P>
<P>
 Rowell began her entertainment career as a classical ballet dancer at age 8. 
Later, she taught ballet and worked as a model. While pregnant with Maya, she 
worked as a secretary, but was eager to start an acting career. In 1990, she 
landed the role of Dru on "The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
 When she started playing the illiterate thief, a homeless victim, there was 
concern among some black viewers that she was playing a negative stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could understand that," she said. "But I also knew that there was going to 
be a metamorphosis (that would) turn this character around. I mean, we were 
able to incorporate my own classical ballet background into the story line!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Y&R's" strong black story line is a subject near and dear to Rowell, because 
she was taken from her first foster family at the age of 2 1/2 because they 
were white and she was half white. It's a fault in the foster-care system that 
Rowell would like to change. But it only confirms her commitment to teach her 
daughter about all of her heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rowell gently asks her platinum-blond haired, blue-eyed daughter what 
color she is, Maya answers proudly, "Black and white."

LETTING THREE-DOM RING; MUSIC: THE ARTISTS IN THE PIANO TRIO 
KALICHSTEIN-LAREDO-ROBINSON ALSO ENJOY SOLO CAREERS. THEY'LL BE AT THE IRVINE 
BARCLAY TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Can't you just hear it? "Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson. May I help you?"  
</P>
<P>
 But Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson isn't a law firm. It's a piano trio, 
appearing, in fact, tonight at the Irvine Barclay Theatre in a concert 
sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society and Laguna Chamber Music 
Society. The program includes trios by Haydn (No. 18 in A), Mendelssohn (No. 1 
in D Minor) and Schubert (No. 2 in E-flat). 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a huge name," admitted pianist Joseph Kalichstein, reached by phone at 
his home in Maplewood, N.J. "The piano-trio format, unlike the string quartet, 
is really three individual voices. . . . We certainly did not invent the 
tradition of using three names. Actually, the Beaux Arts Trio went against 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Were there a Guinness record for longest piano trio name, 
Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson would win handily today. Historically, though, 
they'd play second (or even third) fiddle to such ensembles from the past as 
Heifetz-Piatigorsky-Rubinstein and Fischer-Schneiderhan-Mainardi. Yet 
background materials show little compassion for writers, blaring, DO NOT 
ABBREVIATE TO "KLR."  
</P>
<P>
 With a chuckle, Kalichstein cited a trio at the other end of the spectrum: "I 
remember when Emanuel Ax started playing in his trio (with violinist Young-Uck 
Kim and cellist Yo-Yo Ma), he pointed out that the Ax-Kim-Ma Trio had a shorter 
name than he did alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalichstein was born in Israel, violinist Jaime Laredo in Bolivia, and cellist 
Sharon Robinson in Houston. Kalichstein began playing chamber music with Laredo 
and Robinson, who are husband and wife, 18 years ago. The ensemble made its 
official debut at the White House at the inauguration of President Carter. The 
ensemble was formed after hastily mounted performances of Dvorak's piano 
quintet and piano quartet: Kalichstein, who had played the quintet but never 
seen the quartet, was a last-minute replacement at Laredo's behest; the two had 
played together once before. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, we all remarked how easy the performance was," Kalichstein 
recalled. "We seemed to phrase together, breathe together, sing together. 
Sharon and Jaime came to me and said, 'Maybe we should play together.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time with chamber concerts you're thrown together like that, you 
always wish you had two more rehearsals to scream at each other. We basically 
wanted to play concerts that were properly rehearsed." 
</P>
<P>
 All three musicians enjoy successful solo careers both on the concert stage 
and in the recording studio. Together they've made half a dozen recordings, 
including a recently released Vox Box that includes the three Brahms Piano 
Trios, both Mendelssohn trios and Dvorak's "Dumky" Trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalichstein addressed the pros and cons of playing in a full-time chamber 
ensemble, such as the Beaux Arts Trio, versus juggling solo and chamber 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say, I don't find any cons in our case," he said. "We are lucky enough 
to do both. If we played 100 concerts a year, maybe it would get on our nerves. 
Maybe not. As it is, we only do 35 concerts a year, and without sounding coy, 
we actually enjoy seeing each other each time. There's always a sense of 
rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only yesterday we came back to a piece we hadn't played for a long time, and 
all of a sudden it was in a faster tempo. We all sat up and took notice and 
delighted in the fact that it had continued to live when we were away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Each year the trio tours Europe. Next season they've scheduled more than the 
usual number of concerts, almost 50; Japanese and Australian tours alone 
account for 30 concerts. So who enjoys greater notoriety these days, 
Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson the trio, or Kalichstein, Laredo, Robinson the 
individuals?  
</P>
<P>
 "It could very well be the trio," he said. "I certainly cannot complain if 
it's one or the other. I'm known as a solo pianist, so I don't have an identity 
crisis. I'd played for a good 15 years professionally before we formed this 
trio, so many conductors, orchestras and audiences know me as such. There are 
also new audiences that know me only in a trio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people know me as someone with two different hats. I want to have that 
balance. In fact, that is my ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio plays music by Haydn, Mendelssohn and

GLAAD HONORS 'PHILADELPHIA,' 'AND THE BAND PLAYED ON'; AWARDS: THE GAY AND 
LESBIAN ALLIANCE AGAINST DEFAMATION ALSO RECOGNIZES NBC'S 'SEINFELD' FOR ITS 
'CONTINUED INCLUSION OF GAY AND LESBIAN CHARACTERS.'

 Hollywood's inconsistent track record in portraying gay and lesbian characters 
on the big screen is reflected in the 1993 Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation media awards announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't any (feature film) award given for 1992," said GLAAD's Los 
Angeles executive director Lee Werbel, "because there were no positive feature 
films." 
</P>
<P>
 But this year the honor goes to "Philadelphia," director Jonathan Demme's film 
about a gay attorney with AIDS who is fired from his job. The TriStar Pictures 
release is the first major American feature film to deal directly with the 
10-year-old AIDS epidemic. GLAAD said the film "brings a message of compassion 
and understanding about gay men and AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 The TV sitcom "Seinfeld," HBO's made for television film "And the Band Played 
On," Tony Kushner's stage drama "Angels in America" and recording artist 
Melissa Etheridge also will take home awards from the March 19 banquet in Los 
Angeles underwritten by the David Geffen Foundation. The awards are voted by 
the membership of GLAAD's national affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's "Seinfeld" is cited for its "continued inclusion of gay and lesbian 
characters." HBO's production of author Randy Shilts' "And the Band Played On" 
was credited for chronicling the first decade of AIDS, and Etheridge was 
honored for acknowledging she is lesbian and, in doing so, helping to 
"eliminate stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of sheer "visibility," as the category is labeled, GLAAD's winner is 
playwright Harvey Fierstein, for his overall contributions to increasing the 
visibility of gays and lesbians in the media.  
</P>
<P>
 Independent film winners: Samuel Goldwyn Co.'s release of "The Wedding 
Banquet" and the New York-based Women Make Movies release of "Forbidden Love: 
The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Other TV winners: "Sisters" for an ongoing lesbian character; "Law and Order" 
for an episode dealing with homophobia in the field of law enforcement; and the 
CBS afterschool special "Other Mothers."  
</P>
<P>
 Other winners: community service, Highways Performance Space; advertising, 
Kenneth Cole; TV journalism, Maria Shriver's report on "Gays in the '90s"; 
magazine journalism, Farai Chideya for a Spin magazine article on homophobia in 
the recording business; Deb Price of the Detroit News, the first nationally 
syndicated openly lesbian columnist; and a special award honoring MTV.

L.A. COLLECTIONS ON DISPLAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the smaller surprises in the Roy Lichtenstein retrospective at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art is the number of works -- including some of the best 
-- that come from Los Angeles collections. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15% of the show, or 14 of 91 paintings and sculptures, has been 
drawn from local holdings: Betty Asher, Eli and Edythe Broad, Douglas S. 
Cramer, David Geffen, Steve Martin, the estate of Marcia Weisman and MOCA's own 
Panza Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with two Lichtensteins from the Panza Collection not on view, and 
counting the great 1963 "Cold Shoulder" that is a promised gift to the County 
Museum of Art from Robert Halff of Beverly Hills, an estimable array of the 
artist's work is owned locally. 
</P>
<P>
 With 12 dating from the 1960s -- capped by the great 1963 fighter-pilot 
canvas, "Okay, Hot-Shot!," from the Geffen collection -- those combined 
holdings are especially rich in paintings and sculptures from Lichtenstein's 
most consequential period. 
</P>
<P>
 It only seems right. After all, not only are several of those collectors 
prominent in the entertainment industry, Los Angeles also seems an apt home for 
an art wittily conversant with the strange machinery of mass culture.

 There's no stopping "Mrs. Doubtfire." The Robin Williams comedy with a huge 
$172.5-million gross is now the third-highest-grossing movie released in 1993, 
after only "Jurassic Park" ($342 million) and "The Fugitive" ($179.4 
million).At the current pace of ticket sales, "Doubtfire" will catch "The 
Fugitive" by the week's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "The Pelican Brief," with Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington, is 
rewriting the 1993 Top 10 list, too. With $90.3 million, it is now 1993's 
eighth-highest-grossing release, pushing "Cliffhanger," with $84 million, to 
ninth.

TEACHER SENTENCED FOR FONDLING GIRL STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E. J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran Fullerton high school teacher was sentenced Monday to three years' 
probation and was stripped of his teaching credentials after pleading guilty to 
fondling and making sexual overtures to several female students. 
</P>
<P>
 George Melvin Fairchild, 53, a former life science and mathematics teacher at 
Sunny Hills High School, pleaded not guilty last August after he was ordered to 
stand trial on 15 charges of lewd and lascivious conduct, sexual battery and 
molesting a child under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, he reversed his plea, admitting to four of the charges. He fondled 
the breasts of three teen-age girls and made sexually suggestive comments to 
two girls, Fairchild told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge David O. Carter, who referred to 
Fairchild's acts as "offensive" and "damn serious," added two more guilty 
verdicts, for a total of six. He ordered Fairchild to receive psychological 
counseling and to perform 500 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jo Escobar said after the sentencing: "This was not a case 
of a teacher patting a student on the head." 
</P>
<P>
 During several months in 1992 and 1993, Fairchild fondled the students' 
breasts, commented on their breast sizes and once told a student that she 
should "use her body to get better grades." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Thomas Goethals and Fairchild could not be reached for comment 
after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 In emotional testimony before the sentencing, three victims, who remained 
anonymous throughout the non-jury trial, described the effects of the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been betrayed and lied to and emotionally damaged for life," one 
victim said. "This has totally shattered my image of trusting someone who says, 
'Trust me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said another victim: "What he has done to me can never be taken away or 
forgotten. The damage he did to me and the other girls was wrong, sick and 
perverted." 
</P>
<P>
 After the sentencing, Carter asked Fairchild's friends and family in the 
courtroom to help him overcome his "sickness." The judge then appealed to the 
victims and their families to begin healing and to reach out to other victims 
of sexual molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 By losing his teaching credentials, Fairchild will never be allowed to teach 
in the state of California. In addition, Fairchild will be registered as a sex 
offender, making it difficult for him to teach anywhere in the nation, Escobar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter also prohibited Fairchild from being alone with any girl under 18 years 
old as part of his sentence. Fairchild could face one to five years in jail if 
he violates his probation or other court stipulations. Fairchild is to appear 
again before the court on March 14 for an update on his counseling and 
probation.

HUGE PERFORMING ARTS CENTER PROPOSED FOR SANTA ANA; CONSTRUCTION: THE 
5,500-SEAT THEATER WOULD BE COUNTY'S LARGEST. DEVELOPERS ALSO ENVISION 180-ROOM 
HOTEL TO BE BUILT LATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A development firm has proposed building a hotel and performing arts center -- 
the biggest in Orange County -- next to the MainPlace mall in north Santa Ana, 
city officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5,500 seats, the enclosed theater would hold about 2,500 more people than 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Developers Moss & Co. 
of Santa Monica also want to build an 8- to 10-story, 180-room hotel on the 
3.47-acre site, but not for an additional seven to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no market for a hotel there now," said John Killen, agent for Moss & 
Co. He said he could not estimate how much the total project would cost because 
plans are still in flux. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the developers haven't decided what kind of events to hold 
at the proposed center because a management company hasn't been chosen yet. 
</P>
<P>
 According to planners, the project, proposed near the intersection of Main 
Street and Owens Drive, is in a preliminary stage. At a Feb. 10 meeting, area 
residents and property owners may suggest problems that should be studied in an 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Development plans probably won't go before the City Council for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanya Thomas, MainPlace/Santa Ana general manager, opposes the existing plan, 
fearing that people attending concerts will park cars in spaces belonging to 
the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers propose a 392-car parking structure at the center, and plans call 
for most of the concert patrons to park at office buildings away from the site 
and take shuttles to the theater.  
</P>
<P>
 However, said Thomas, "we believe theatergoers are going to park wherever it's 
most convenient." 
</P>
<P>
 Killen said the developers have an alternate plan that may include buying 
other nearby property to provide parking within walking distance of the venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Robyn Uptegraff, executive director of the city's Planning and Building 
Department, called the project concept "exciting" but said MainPlace is a 
"cornerstone of the city's commercial activity (and) we want to ensure no 
project negatively impacts it." 
</P>
<P>
 Main Street north of MainPlace is being widened to accommodate more traffic, 
Uptegraff said, but officials who planned the widening only took into account 
traffic patterns from current and future MainPlace stores and a project planned 
on the eastern side of Main -- not the concert hall and hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss & Co. representatives have met with neighborhood associations to discuss 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development could be of huge benefit to the area," said John Zarian, 
president of the West Floral Park Neighborhood Assn. "But everyone wants to go 
into it with their eyes open." 
</P>
<P>
 A concert hall would be the latest addition to Santa Ana's effort to become 
the county's urban and cultural hub.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's museum district, with the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art and a 
planned children's museum at its heart, lies to the south. And last year, the 
City Council approved the Main Street Concourse, a $500-million development 
proposed on the eastern side of Main Street.  
</P>
<P>
 That project would include the county's tallest office tower, townhomes, 
stores, a live theater and movie theater. Construction has not begun yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's proposed concert hall may feel stiff competition from other 
facilities. Whether the area can support another performing arts venue depends 
on what's presented there, said Victor Gotesman, general manager of the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hall could succeed if it stages programs that don't duplicate 
presentations at other nearby sites, said Gotesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a vast marketplace and there are certainly enough people to support 
the venues here now, if everyone develops their own particular niche," Gotesman 
said. "It's certainly worth a shot if the programming were developed carefully 
in conjunction with what the community needs were." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos center's annual operating budget is about $7.8 million, and it 
receives about $2 million of that from the city of Cerritos.  
</P>
<P>
 Killen said Moss & Co. have not asked the city to subsidize their proposed 
hall.

OLD BOAT, NEW VOYAGE; GIFT: TWO DOCTORS HAVE DONATED THEIR RACING SLOOP TO THE 
ORANGE COAST COLLEGE SAILING PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Dr. Robert Burns got a new racing boat, he and his sailing partner faced 
a decision of what to do with the Witch Doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 What they decided was to donate the $400,000 racing sloop, which Burns 
co-owned with Dr. Neil Barth, to Orange Coast College's sailing program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boat's purpose was truly that of a racing boat, and it deserves to be in 
a fairly prominent racing environment, which OCC has managed to establish and 
maintain," said Burns. "We wanted it to have a broader access to the community 
. . . and we knew it would be well taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 So in December, the 44-foot Witch Doctor -- a pun-like name that its physician 
co-owners took from the question, "Which Doctor?" -- sailed into North Lido 
Channel as the third major gift to the sailing program in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The two others are the Alaska Eagle, OCC's main floating classroom, and the 
Obsession, which was donated to the college in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that comes along very often," said Ann Owens, office 
coordinator for the sailing program. But when community residents think about 
what to do with a sailboat they aren't going to use anymore, they often think 
of OCC, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look to our program when they want to donate a boat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' reasons for donating the Witch Doctor were similar to those of Stephen 
R. Nichols, who said he wanted to make sure that his gift, a 70-foot, $800,000 
racing sloop named the Obsession, would be put to the greatest possible use in 
an established sailing program. He had also come to know Brad Avery, director 
of OCC's sailing program, through sailing races. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 people have taken courses in beginning sailing, navigation, 
maintenance, power boating and marine sciences at OCC, said Avery. And many of 
them get hooked for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They quit their jobs, sell their homes and sail away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the college now has the Witch Doctor, the Alaska Eagle will be able to 
take off on a yearlong cruise with students in July, without interrupting the 
studies of those who remain behind. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, beginners studying navigation, handling and anchoring of a 
sailing boat often had to wait several months each year for the Alaska Eagle to 
return from trips. No other boat was equally suitable for overnight cruising to 
Catalina and hands-on practice, said Avery. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the Witch Doctor is in. 
</P>
<P>
 The black and red boat won "First in Class" at the 1991 San Francisco Big Boat 
competition, a series of high-speed races around the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a wonderful boat," said Erica Christian, 26, a two-year participant 
in the sailing program. "It's very light, very fast. . . . It's a good basic 
boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Though fully equipped with 20 bags of sails and navigation equipment, the boat 
is also light enough for one person to handle the winches, said Christian. But 
it's large enough to comfortably accommodate six passengers for overnight 
voyages. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes in navigation, safety, marine diesel repair and other sailing-related 
skills will be held on the Witch Doctor, with about six students per session, 
said Avery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of the size people would have" if they bought their own boats, he 
said. "People can relate to the Witch Doctor. It has everything they would need 
to have to (learn about) cruising." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, some larger sloops have more room, said Christian, "but speed is 
everything and comfort is nothing. The Witch Doctor is both fast and 
comfortable."  
</P>
<P>
 Avery and a few students are still cleaning up the new floating classroom for 
use later in June, when it will begin taking students to the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Barth said he already misses his boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like giving a pet away," said Barth. "You give it to someone you know 
will take good care of it."

WATER OFFICIALS TOLD TO REPORT PAST GIFTS; UTILITIES: THE ORDER TO SANTA 
MARGARITA DISTRICT'S TOP EMPLOYEES FOLLOWS REVELATION OF GRATUITIES RECEIVED 
FROM CHIEF OUTSIDE ENGINEERING FIRM. 
</P>

<P>
 Top employees of the Santa Margarita Water District were ordered Monday to 
amend their statements of economic interest dating back a decade or more to 
include any free meals and gifts they failed to report receiving from those 
doing business with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager John J. Schatz said he ordered the action Monday after The 
Times reported that the district's two top engineers were treated to hundreds 
of meals and gifts valued at nearly $12,000 by the district's chief outside 
engineering firm between 1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based engineering firm of Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates 
provided the gifts -- including stays in resort towns -- to Bill Dye, the 
district's top engineer, and his assistant, Dan Ferons, during a four-year 
period in which the company was awarded nearly $12 million in contracts that 
were not competitively bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye, 58, has never reported receiving anything of value from any contractor on 
the statements of economic interest he has been required to file every year 
under state conflict-of-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferons, 34, has not been required to file statements of economic interest and 
was under no obligation to refrain from using his influence on Bein-Frost's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Political Reform Act of 1974 makes it illegal, however, for 
certain "designated officials" who receive gifts worth more than $250 in any 
one year to use their influence to steer any business to the gift-giver in the 
succeeding 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bein-Frost's spending on Dye, who has been one of the district's designated 
officials since 1979, surpassed that amount in each of the four years, yet Dye 
continued to recommend and vote on Bein-Frost contracts in apparent violation 
of the reform act. 
</P>
<P>
 In a press release issued late Monday, Schatz defended the two men, saying 
they had been "following the rules as they understood them prior to last year," 
when the district became embroiled in a scandal involving lavish spending of 
district funds by its two top managers, and their acceptance of at least 
$60,000 in gifts from engineering firms and other contractors they had 
recommended for lucrative district work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to last year, Bill (Dye) and other employees simply were not aware . . 
. that meals provided during working sessions with the district's engineers 
were reportable gifts," Schatz said, tacitly acknowledging that the gifts 
should have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Dye and other employees who file statements of economic interest, 
including the district's chief financial officer, operations manager and 
controller, are now being asked to retroactively review the total dollar amount 
of meals they were provided by vendors, and to amend their statements of 
economic interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz did not address reporting of anything other than meals, although Ferons 
received an all-expenses-paid trip to Orlando, Fla., from Bein-Frost, and Dye 
was treated to a stay in a Monterey hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz said he found no evidence to suggest that Dye and Ferons "ever received 
anything from vendors in exchange for recommendations to hire those vendors. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz skirted the issue of whether Dye violated state law by voting to 
recommend contracts to a firm from which he had accepted gifts in excess of 
state limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Dye received more than $5,000 from Bein-Frost between 1989 and 1992 
and would have been prohibited from voting on any contract involving Bein-Frost 
for the years 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Schatz's praise for Dye's and Ferons' "continued valuable 
contributions" to the district, one board member pledged to investigate their 
actions further and said nothing had been decided about either engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know the details and I want to know them now," said board member 
Bob Lay. "I intend to have a very serious chat with Mr. Dye and Mr. Ferons and 
ask them, very firmly, what was going on. This is not going to be swept under 
the rug." 
</P>
<P>
 Lay, one of three new board members elected in November after last spring's 
scandal, said he was disturbed by the disclosures and planned to raise them at 
Friday's engineering committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to do some investigating and I'm not sure how to start," Lay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ferons was not among those lower-level employees designated by the 
district to comply with the state law, he did not have to report the Bein-Frost 
gifts, which totaled more than $6,000 between 1989 and 1992. But Schatz said 
Ferons will be among a number of "second-tier" department supervisors who now 
will be required to file interest statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye has steadfastly refused comment on the matter. Ferons has referred all 
inquiries to Schatz. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye appears to be in a similar situation as his former bosses, ex-general 
manager Walter W. (Bill) Knitz and his onetime assistant, Michael P. Lord, who 
accepted thousands of dollars in entertainment and gifts from Bein-Frost and 
other companies they recommended for contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Knitz and Lord are under investigation by the district attorney's office 
and the FBI for possible conflict-of-interest law violations. Both took early 
retirement last May after the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon thereafter, Dye and other district employees were made aware, during a 
legal seminar sponsored by the district, that they were required to report such 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Dye challenged the need for him to file statements of economic 
interest because state guidelines called for the "district engineer" to file, 
while his title is "chief engineer." 
</P>
<P>
 In his press release, Schatz said that, "unfortunately, even following last 
year's events, Bill did not receive clear direction that prior years' 
statements could or should be amended."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; THOSE WHO WAIT FOR FOOD STAMPS FIND LONG LINES 
BUT LESS CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Because of the food stamp cheats, Barbara Brown could not replace the baby 
food she lost during the earthquake, could not pay her rent and had to wait all 
morning Monday in a half-mile-long line -- for the third time in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, thousands of people who suffered losses in the quake were granted 
emergency food vouchers the day they applied. But because of suspicions that 
many of the applications were fraudulent, a 72-hour waiting period was 
instituted to give county workers time to verify claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, because of the rip-off artists, people like me have to suffer," said 
Brown, a mother of two, as she waited in line at a Dodger Stadium parking lot. 
"If they had checked people out right from the beginning, instead of waiting, 
we would have had our food by now." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say they are now vigorously pursuing food stamp cheats, and 
one suspect was arraigned Monday in federal court. Four others are scheduled to 
be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 people waited in line Monday at Dodger Stadium, one of four 
large processing centers county officials opened in the hopes of avoiding the 
mass confusion of last week. There were extremely long lines last week at the 
29 county welfare offices, and numerous tales of abuse surfaced as about 50,000 
people applied for the emergency food vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, county officials tried to rectify the situation by establishing 
centralized application centers and steering applicants away from some of the 
overburdened county welfare offices. And by verifying claims, officials hoped 
to keep the cheats away. 
</P>
<P>
 Although people still waited in long lines Monday at Dodger Stadium and other 
sites, the processing program had fewer hitches than last week. The lines at 
the large centers moved quicker, there were more employees to handle the 
paperwork, and there was a large police presence to keep order. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still glitches that need to be addressed, said Lew Hollman, an 
attorney for San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services. The elderly and 
disabled are forced to wait in long lines in the hot sun, and the county has 
made no special provisions for them. And, he said, none of those who filled out 
the food stamp forms were given any paperwork to verify that they had applied. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could lead to major problems," Hollman said. "If 1,000 applications are 
lost, what happens to those people? Does that mean they've lost the chance to 
obtain any food stamps?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many people in line Monday were frustrated because they had waited in line 
last week, they were waiting again this week and, after filling out their 
applications, must wait three more days for their vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 72 hours of making a claim, applicants will be notified by mail that 
they can pick up their vouchers, which are provided through a U.S. Department 
of Agriculture program that is being managed by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside a Panorama City welfare office, more than 1,500 earthquake victims -- 
many without food or a place to sleep -- applied for food stamps. County 
employees used bullhorns to notify the crowd in Spanish, English and Armenian 
that there is now a waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people in line thought the waiting period would only hurt those 
who were in need. The scammers, they said, had gotten their food stamps last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who was doing wrong got what they wanted, and now the ones who are 
honest and really need it have to wait for three days," said Lydia Sanchez of 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez waited in line last Tuesday with her four children without obtaining 
any vouchers. She and her children are living on food donated by local 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Carter, who applied for food stamps for the first time on Monday, is 
living in a friend's motor home. His Van Nuys apartment was condemned after the 
earthquake and he lost his job as a customer service worker when his work site 
was heavily damaged. He blamed government officials for failing to prevent the 
fraud last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't that what computers are for?" Carter said. "It seems to me that the 
government ought to be able to check people pretty quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are now taking a number of precautions to prevent fraud. Every 
application will be cross-checked by the county's central computer system, said 
Mike Collins, a division chief for the county Department of Public Social 
Services. If people try to apply for the emergency food vouchers a second time 
or if they claim more dependents than the last time they applied for county 
benefits, their cases will be referred to fraud investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Brown waited four hours last week outside a Los Angeles welfare office 
until she finally gave up because the line was moving so slowly. She returned 
the next day at 5:30 a.m. and waited another few hours. When Brown finally met 
with a county worker, she was given an appointment to return Monday. But when 
she arrived at the welfare office, she was told to line up at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to spend all my money replacing food I lost during the earthquake 
and feeding my kids," Brown said. "I know some other people in that line last 
week didn't lose a damn thing. They just heard there was free money at the 
welfare office, so they just lined up with their hands out. Now the rest of us 
have to pay the price."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; THE 6.6 FIX; AFTER THE QUAKE, DOORS OPEN, A 
CLOCK TICKS, A BAD BACK IS BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the havoc it wrought, all the rubble it left behind, the Northridge 
quake also fixed a few things. 
</P>
<P>
 A broken wall clock, for example, that began ticking after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," said Sheila Shaler, whose Chatsworth home suffered heavy damage. 
"I have a Westminster chime clock and it hadn't been running for six months. It 
really startled me when it chimed." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other reports of resurrection by rock and roll. A chronically 
jammed door in Hollywood now swings freely. A Hermosa Beach car radio lost its 
irritating buzz. These and other such occurrences supplied quirky justification 
for that time-honored home remedy: If something doesn't work, jiggle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Shaler said of her clock, "I think the earthquake shook the 
you-know-what out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, such minor miracles pale in comparison to the billions of dollars 
in damages. In the past two weeks, appliance shops have been overwhelmed with 
requests to replace everything from shattered oven doors to torn water-heater 
pipes. Scores of television sets and computers required attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been silver linings. 
</P>
<P>
 A troublesome photocopier now performs without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the feeder, the thing that feeds paper into the machine," said Robert 
Manuwal, a Ventura Boulevard attorney. "I had a copier guy coming every other 
day and he couldn't fix it. Now it works fine. It's really strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Strange but not unexpected. Repairmen say that quake-inflicted repairs often 
involve electrical contact points that had fallen out of alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever had a flashlight that didn't work and, if you shook it, you 
could get it to switch on?" asked Scott Kassner, general manager of a North 
Hills appliance store. He explained that shaking sometimes causes contact 
points to reunite. "You make just enough of a circuit for the power to flow 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing may have happened during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the repairs were mechanical, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Frazier of Cerritos had suffered from an aching back for 10 years. "It 
hurt him every morning he woke up," said his wife, Shirley. Every morning, that 
is, until the day of the quake. Since then he has felt no pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks maybe the shaking of the bed shook something into place in his 
back," his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaking also caused larger adjustments. Some rigid plates that make up the 
Earth's outer shell were suffering from a good deal of strain before the quake 
provided relief. Crooked house frames were similarly jarred into alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Brastow of Topanga Canyon reports that the crack in her front porch, 
opened by a previous quake, has now closed considerably. She can tell because 
kitty litter from the cat box on the porch no longer gets stuck in the crack. 
</P>
<P>
 In other homes, doors and windows that had been sticking now open. For 
homeowners who suffered the reverse -- jammed doors -- there may be hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people to wait till the next one and maybe it will straighten itself 
out," said John Smith, who owns a Los Angeles carpentry service. "Nature works 
in funny ways." 
</P>
<P>
 The effects also extend beyond the purely practical. For the past year, artist 
Kilgore Bohorquez has been hard at work in a West Hills garage, assembling a 
massive piece that blends wood, metal and various other materials in a cross 
between classical sculpture and debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole garage settled and shifted," Bohorquez said, explaining that his 
artwork suffered partial damage but, in the process, became aesthetically 
complete. "The earthquake added a finishing touch. It added an element that I 
love, the element of spontaneity. There's no way I can be as spontaneous as an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 And the picture quality of his aging color television set improved to boot, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But earthquake-caused repairs may prove short-lived. Reunited contact points 
are likely to shift out of touch again. Pendulum clocks that were given a 
jump-start by the shaking will probably run down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Coffey, a Granada Hills clock repairman, says it reminds him of a radio 
evangelist who broadcast in Bakersfield during the 1950s. The evangelist 
claimed to repair broken watches if listeners would lay the watches atop their 
radios during his show. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did this when the weather was cold. People didn't realize that some 
watches don't work in cold weather, the grease gets too hard inside," Coffey 
said. "When his hour show was over, the watches were all warmed up and running. 
But they eventually stopped. It's the same with clocks that were fixed in the 
earthquake. They'll only work for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaler's clock, alas, stopped ticking several days ago. However, while 
clearing broken glass and the rubble of fallen chimneys, she can take some 
comfort from the unusual silence in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My refrigerator used to sound like a small diesel truck," she said. "A 
repairman came out twice before the earthquake and said the sound was normal. 
Now, it's purring like a kitten."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; NEW MOBILE HOME RULES CONSIDERED; DAMAGE: 
NEARLY 10% OF SUCH DWELLING UNITS IN L.A. COUNTY WERE RENDERED UNINHABITABLE BY 
THE QUAKE. SOME CALL FOR NEW BRACING REQUIREMENTS.

<P>
 Nearly 10% of all mobile homes in Los Angeles County have been declared 
uninhabitable as a result of earthquake damage, sparking renewed interest over 
whether costly safety measures should be required by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 51,062 mobile homes in parks in Los Angeles County, 4,947 were damaged by 
the magnitude 6.6 quake to the extent that they are not livable, said Travis 
Pitts, deputy director for codes and standards for the California Department of 
Housing and Community Development, which oversees mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them tumbled all the way off their support systems onto the ground," 
Pitts said. "Some shifted on their foundations enough that they are considered 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 184 were burned to the ground in fires fueled mostly by ruptured 
gas lines, one of which took the life of a 92-year-old woman at Sunburst Park 
Mobile Homes in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Mayor Richard Riordan toured three fire-damaged mobile home parks 
in Sylmar with City Councilman Hal Bernson, and both called for heightened 
seismic safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I've noticed is that most of this could have been avoided with 
some common sense measures," Riordan said. "We'll see what we can learn from 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitts said changes in safety standards are being drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state housing department has long favored requiring restraints to 
help keep mobile homes in place during earthquakes, strong opposition over the 
cost -- estimated at up to $3,000 per mobile home -- and the laborious process 
of justifying new regulations has kept such measures unrealized, Pitts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an issue of priorities and resources," Pitts said. "I think earthquake 
restraints will take a higher priority for us now, but I still don't have the 
staff or the resources to finish the regulation process right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining in support for added safety requirements is the state Seismic Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a preliminary report surveying the damage, the commission 
recommended that all mobile homes in California be secured to foundations on 
installation by July 1, 1995. In addition, the commission proposed that all 
mobile homes sold after Oct. 1, 1995, be anchored to foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 To place new requirements on mobile homes, the department must conduct 
exhaustive hearings and answer all concerns from the public to satisfy the 
staff of the Office of Administrative Law, which approves new regulations, 
Pitts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department proposed mandatory "sawhorse-type" supports twice during the 
1970s, Pitts said. But they were opposed by the Golden State Mobilehome Owners 
League, the state's only association of mobile home residents, on the grounds 
that the cost of installing supports -- usually in the $800-$3,000 range -- 
would keep people of lower incomes out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The devastation of the Northridge quake, plus a change in league leadership, 
could result in a change in that position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly don't oppose restraints now," said Golden State Vice President 
Pat Lowery, whose mobile home slid from its foundation during the quake. 
"Anything that will save our homes, we should do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, said Tony Hadley, vice president of the Manufactured 
Housing Institute, a national trade association, is that restraints used in 
states prone to hurricanes and tornadoes may not prevent mobile homes from 
slipping off their foundations during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is actually way ahead when it comes to safety standards," Hadley 
said. "They have at least done most of the necessary research." 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been proposals to require that mobile homes come equipped with 
devices that automatically shut off gas in case of an earthquake or ruptured 
gas line, Pitts said, but state officials and utility companies have been 
unsatisfied with their design. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the damaged homes in the San Fernando Valley and outlying areas will 
be livable once they are lifted back onto their foundations by using cranes or 
hydraulic jacks, Pitts said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may be weeks before thousands of mobile home dwellers -- many of whom 
are senior citizens -- can begin repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet P. LaCoe, 57, who lives alone at Northridge Mobile Home Park, said a 
close call during the earthquake persuaded her to install some sort of safety 
brace under her home once it is replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "My steps came off and blocked my door," LaCoe said. "I got out through a 
window but if there had been a fire, I might not have gotten out. And there are 
a lot of older ladies here who are lucky they made it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 John Quick, who suffered about $20,000 in damage in his home at the Tahitian 
Mobilehome Park, said he, too, would support mandatory restraints.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised that my home didn't stay up better than it did," Quick 
said. "They should require quake bracing because I don't think people will do 
it on their own."  
</P>
<P>
 State inspectors going park to park during the past two weeks found mobile 
homes next to their foundations or tilted, supports sticking through floors and 
ashes where homes once stood. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey by Pitts' department also found 559 of Ventura County's 9,425 
mobile homes unlivable.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 2 HIGH SCHOOLS WILL BE SHUT TILL MARCH; 
EDUCATION: DECISION TO KEEP DAMAGED EL CAMINO REAL AND KENNEDY CAMPUSES CLOSED 
UPSETS SOME PARENTS. IT GIVES 5,000 STUDENTS AN UNEXPECTED SEVEN-WEEK VACATION.

 Supt. Sid Thompson said Monday that El Camino Real and John F. Kennedy high 
schools -- the two Los Angeles city secondary schools with the most earthquake 
damage -- will not reopen until March, a move that did not sit well with some 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision leaves 5,000 students scattered across the city with an 
unexpected seven-week winter vacation. In the interim, district officials plan 
to provide some instructional programs at El Camino using portable classrooms 
but no plans have been made yet for Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said at a news conference Monday that the March reopening followed 
the wishes of the staff of both schools to delay classes rather than 
temporarily divide students among other campuses. Public meetings were 
scheduled this week to address parents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have moved a lot of kids around this city and gotten them located . . 
. just so I could have said I got them back in school," Thompson said. "The 
important thing is to keep these kids back at their school sites." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a bottom line premise -- no young person will suffer from this 
educationally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District, which had about 14,000 students still 
out of quake-impacted schools Monday, sustained significant damage at about 170 
campuses. Most suffered architectural and cosmetic problems with a handful 
sustaining serious structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino has no structural damage but classroom partition walls were loosened 
and could collapse; Kennedy's three-story administration building suffered 
structural damage and will need rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson also announced that another eight schools will reopen today. They 
are: Andasol Elementary, Canoga Park Elementary, Castlebay Lane Elementary, 
Granada Hills High, Patrick Henry Middle School, Leonis Continuation School, 
Tarzana Elementary and Tulsa Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 11 schools will reopen later this week or next Monday. After that, 
only the two severely damaged high schools and Van Gogh Street Elementary in 
Granada Hills will remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Red Cross information, the district estimates that 836 students are 
staying at shelters throughout the city. On Monday, about 100 of those students 
were picked up by district buses and taken to their local schools, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at El Camino in Woodland Hills and Kennedy in Granada Hills were 
complaining Monday that they have been given little information about the 
schools' status and have been left out of the decision- making. Some parents 
said the district should be working faster to get their children back in their 
own school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really terrible. I think it's much too long," said Jay Lee, a parent 
with one child at El Camino. "I haven't been given any information. There's 
nothing for these kids to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Leder, another El Camino parent, said: "We don't pay enough attention to 
these kids. We're saying: 'We have broken down schools, no money and you don't 
count.' This is real hard on these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino plans to use portable classrooms to offer optional classes for 
Advanced Placement students and others preparing to take the SAT exam. Thompson 
said a program may also be offered for students who speak limited English. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about the kids that really need help, what's going to happen to them?" 
asked Evelyn Aragon, whose daughter is a junior at El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kennedy, Principal Andreda Pruitt said there are no plans for any optional 
classes during the break. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a very long time for school to be out," said Juliet Charles, a 
teacher's assistant at Kennedy whose daughter attends there. "I'm concerned 
about the students. I'm advising them to read and start practicing some math." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said there was no intent to exclude parents from decisions. But he 
said the district needed to examine its options in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 
quake before parent meetings could be held.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had to get our act together to tell them our options," Thompson said. "It 
would have been premature. We waited until we had a better feel for what the 
damage was." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino will hold a parents meeting on campus Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and 
Kennedy will hold two meetings -- at 7 p.m. Thursday at the school and next 
Monday at the school district's senior high division on 17th Street in 
Downtown.  
</P>
<P>
 Of El Camino's 2,700 students, 900 are bused from around Los Angeles. Of 
Kennedy's 2,300 students, about 1,000 are bused to school. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for some lost class time, officials said the two high schools 
probably will extend the school day by 39 minutes and the school year by two 
weeks to meet state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's top two education officials -- Acting Supt. of Public Instruction 
William Dawson and Maureen DiMarco, secretary of child development and 
education -- said they would not criticize the school closure decisions from 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for me to sit up here and second-guess the decisions that are 
being made locally on this issue at this time," Dawson said. "I'm not prepared 
to say that any of the decisions are inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Julie Korenstein, who represents Kennedy, said she cannot 
blame parents who are upset with the delay in resuming classes but supports the 
superintendent's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the most frustrating situation that I can imagine being in," 
Korenstein said. "This was a disaster and, of course, my preference would have 
been to get these kids back sooner but the schools made the decisions 
themselves. They did not want the kids scattered." 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Gogh Street Elementary in Granada Hills, which will undergo an 
extensive geological study, students will have to be relocated -- perhaps by 
next week, officials said. The students, which has deep fissures in the 
corridors and playground areas, probably will be relocated to Frost Middle 
School in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Popiel, a parent with one child at Van Gogh and another at Frost, said 
the lack of information from the schools has been frustrating and that the 
district should have been more responsive to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would just like to know what's going on with our schools -- and more 
officially and not from calling the school offices or reading the newspaper," 
Popiel said. "It would be nice to get official word on what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost is scheduled to reopen Wednesday, with about 15 classes relocated to 
other classrooms because of water damage, officials said. School Reopenings The

500 PACK CITY HALL FOR DEBATE ON WETLANDS' FUTURE; DEVELOPMENT: PASSION FLARES 
ON BOTH SIDES OF HOUSING PROJECT WITH RESTORATION PLEDGE. COUNTY HAS REFUSED TO 
HOLD HEARINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An estimated 500 residents Monday night converged on City Hall, expressing 
deeply divided and often emotional views about the proposed development of the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a blueprint for the destruction of the entire Bolsa Chica," said Dave 
Hall, a local environmentalist. "Overall, it's a bad project." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cecil Birnbaum, a local designer, countered: "There's a silent majority 
that supports (this project). Bolsa Chica is not an endangered jewel, it's an 
oil field." 
</P>
<P>
 Under discussion is a plan by the Koll Real Estate group, owner of the 
wetlands, to build 4,286 homes on 400 acres in exchange for a promise to spend 
$48 million on restoring 1,100 acres of wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials scheduled Monday's public hearing after becoming angry at the 
county's refusal to hold its own hearings on the recently released draft 
environmental impact report on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have defended their action, saying it would be practically 
impossible to respond to each comment in a public hearing. Instead, they said 
parties have until Feb. 18 to submit their written responses to the EIR, after 
which hearings will be scheduled in May. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70 speakers rose to express their views about the project, often 
evoking either cheers or jeers from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Lagrue -- a spokesman for the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, which opposes the 
project -- left a basket of lemons next to the podium, telling City Council 
members, "We'd like to show you that Orange County has presented you a lemon of 
an EIR." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Rocha, a Native American, said she was outraged that the recent discovery 
of 8,000-year-old Indian remains at the site wasn't mentioned in the 
environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area is very precious to Native American people," she said. " . . . It 
was part of what Mother Nature gave us. You're destroying a land that should be 
left alone." 
</P>
<P>
 However, there were strongly opposing opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Julien, president of the Bolsa Chica Alliance, pointed out that without 
the development, there would be no funds to preserve the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just where's the money going to come from (for restoration)? It's time we get 
realistic. We have an opportunity to create the largest restored wetlands in 
the state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent dispute over the project came last week, when opponents 
charged that the Koll Real Estate Group and its private archeologist withheld 
information on the discovery of ancient bones. Koll officials and the 
archeologist denied the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 According to anthropologists, the discovery of human bones at the site has 
potential significance to both scientists and Native Americans interested in 
retaining their culture.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
FIRM OFFERS FREE HOUSING TO ELDERLY QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Costa Mesa-based company that provides assisted living to senior citizens 
announced Monday that it will provide free, temporary housing for elderly 
victims of the Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Seniors can choose a furnished unit at senior apartment communities owned by 
ARV Housing Group in Redondo Beach, Azusa, Pomona, Claremont, or at three 
retirement villas in Covina, San Dimas and Walnut, said company spokesman 
Bernard Sandalow.Housing is also available in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandalow said the offer is good through March 1. Seniors will be accommodated 
on a first-come, first-served basis and will be under no obligation to buy or 
rent the facility in which they stay, he said. The program is being offered in 
cooperation with the Los Angeles chapter of the American Red Cross, Sandalow 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 'VERTIPORT' URGED FOR SITE NEAR DISNEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young on Monday proposed placing a "vertiport" for 
vertical takeoff and landing aircraft atop a planned parking and transit garage 
next to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, to be built if the Walt Disney Co. proceeds with plans for its 
Westcot addition to Disneyland, would be one of the world's largest parking 
garages. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a deal worked out between several government agencies, parking revenue 
would be reserved for transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The garage would also serve as a bus and urban rail stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking beyond helping the business of one company, we'll be able to link the 
bus system with automobiles and" urban rail, said Young, who chairs an 11-city 
urban rail advisory group. "And we'll be able to look at putting VTOL on top of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Young said vertical takeoff and landing aircraft would be ideal for trips to 
Santa Barbara, Bakersfield and San Diego and would fill unmet travel needs of 
both business people and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's comments came during a transportation planners' conference at the 
Anaheim Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor, who serves on the Orange County Transportation Authority board, 
also predicted that studies soon to be completed by OCTA will support 
construction of an elevated urban rail line that would run between the South 
Coast Plaza/Irvine Spectrum/John Wayne Airport area and either Disneyland or 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 With regard to the VTOL pad, Young said he hasn't formally proposed it to OCTA 
because Disney officials haven't yet made a final decision to build Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 VTOL discussions highlighted parts of the conference, which focused on linking 
various modes of transport. 
</P>
<P>
 Several speakers said VTOL technology can contribute to the overall mix of 
transfer options, relieving existing airports as well as providing new links 
between various places within the same region. 
</P>
<P>
 A VTOL facility is planned for Atlanta, and another was recently built in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cliff Bragdon of Long Island's Dowling College created the biggest stir. 
He urged planners to abandon their two-dimensional land-use thinking in favor 
of "space planning" that accounts for all human senses, including smell. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited plans for a 32-story complex to be build underground in Osaka, Japan, 
with a park on the bottom floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of smell is important, too, Bragdon said, so planners must take 
"spacescapes" into account, "not landscapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he reported, airline passengers will be given whiffs that can aid sleep 
on overseas flights, and new cars will be equipped to emit scents that help 
drivers stay awake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Single buildings for single purposes are archaic, as are the people who 
design them," Bragdon said. "Those people should be eliminated." JEFFREY A.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; WORKSHOP TO AIR DOHENY VILLAGE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City planners will present three visions for the future of the historic, 
150-acre Doheny Village at a public workshop at 7 tonight at Capistrano Beach's 
Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 The bowl-shaped village beneath the Interstate 5 freeway in Capistrano Beach 
could remain the sleepy, small-town community it has been for decades or become 
the major industrial and commercial base of the city, depending on which plan 
is ultimately chosen by the City Council, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A straw vote on three alternatives will be taken among those attending the 
workshop, said Michael Philbrick, an associate city planner. The results of the 
voting will be aired during an upcoming joint session of the city planning 
commission and City Council, Philbrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing written in stone," Philbrick said. "Everything is still 
subject to change. . . . None of the plans are for actual development. They are 
more like a blueprint of what could occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Philbrick said city officials expect to come up with a fourth plan from 
suggestions that arise during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The three current plans were based on a marketing study of the village, and 
each divides the area into six parcels, Philbrick said. The city will study 
both low- and high-density development in each parcel and ultimately make a 
decision on which combination of land uses the council prefers, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the alternatives include a train station to make use of the double set 
of railroad tracks that traverse the village, Philbrick said. One of the plans 
calls for extending the train station into a center for multiple types of 
transportation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three plans also calls for relocating the Capistrano Unified 
School District's large bus yard, officials said. The least intense plan calls 
for transforming the yard into a park, while the others suggest developing it 
into a residential area or a commercial office area, Philbrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the 169-space Beachwood Mobile Home Park will also be a topic of 
discussion, Philbrick said. 
</P>

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
QUAKE DAMAGES HOME OF FIREFIGHTER SHOT IN RIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fate has been unusually cruel for Scott Miller: The firefighter was shot 
during the riots and his San Fernando Valley home was severely damaged in the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fire captain does not believe that the riots and earthquake have much 
in common. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's apples and oranges. They're completely different animals, completely 
different types of events, with completely different types or origins," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the magnitude 6.6 quake struck Jan. 17, Miller, his wife, Kathi, and 
their children, Ryan, 7, and Julianne, 5, were asleep in their Granada Hills 
home just a few miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The house cracked, items flew off shelves and a 300-pound piano danced away 
from a wall as the earth groaned beneath them. The Miller family scampered 
outside into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could see fires in five different directions," said Miller, who was shot 
after responding to a fire on April 29, 1992, just hours after a jury acquitted 
four police officers in the beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake cracked the foundation of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worse than some, not as bad as others," Miller said. "As a city, we're 
awfully darn lucky we didn't lose more people. You just roll with the punches 
and keep on going."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; CITY STUDIES ANNEX OF FOOTHILL RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slowly, cautiously, the city is looking into annexing the massive, potentially 
lucrative Foothill Ranch housing development. 
</P>
<P>
 With the planned 3,900-unit development incomplete and an economic recession 
still gripping the state, city officials say they are easing their way into the 
complicated annexation process. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lake Forest hasn't filed official annexation papers yet, the city 
recently completed a preliminary study and made initial contact with the 
county, which runs the unincorporated community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have agreed (among the council) to move very slowly with the annexation 
because of recessionary times," said Councilwoman Ann Van Haun. "There is a lot 
of work that has to be in place before we can start" filing annexation papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Ranch is on the north city border. Currently about 1,611 houses have 
been completed and build-out is anticipated in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,743-acre development could provide a significant sales tax windfall for 
the city. The project's centerpiece is a 113-acre retail "power center" that 
will showcase 1.2 million acres of building space. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants already signed for the Foothill Ranch Towne Centre include Walmart, 
which will move into a 125,000-square-foot structure, and Homebase, a discount 
store that plans to occupy a 130,000-square-foot building. The center will also 
have a 24-screen movie complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping and entertainment complex would be the second largest in the 
county after South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue potential of Foothill Ranch will probably be matched by the task 
of persuading the county to allow the annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials reiterated on Monday that their annexation policies are 
unchanged.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; TAPPING A RESERVOIR OF HUMAN KINDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jack Greenberg was annoyed with himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaced victims of the Northridge earthquake were struggling through cold 
and rain, and he was just sitting back, doing nothing, in the warmth and 
comfort of his Leisure World home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling guilty, because all I was doing was expressing sympathy for 
them, but not doing anything," Greenberg recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jan. 25, he telephoned the Red Cross and offered to organize a drive for 
clothing and food. Told that the agency would take whatever he could collect, 
Greenberg sprung into action. 
</P>
<P>
 Too late to make arrangements to use a Leisure World recreation center as a 
collection point, he decided his single-car garage would just have to do. 
Needing to get the word out, he persuaded the community paper to squeeze in a 
few paragraphs just before deadline announcing his effort. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday morning, when the paper hit doorsteps, Greenberg knew he'd done 
the right thing. His phone began ringing every few minutes and cars started 
pulling up at the driveway with people dropping off warm clothes and 
non-perishable food. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next three days, the Greenberg house became the epicenter of Leisure 
World's earthquake donation drive. While his wife, Elenor, answered the 
repeatedly ringing phone, Greenberg met the steady stream of people who came up 
the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came by the droves. Hundreds of people came," he said, beaming. "It was 
almost like a traffic jam. They would come two and three at a time, dropping 
things off and saying they appreciated the opportunity to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Some who came had tears in their eyes, Greenberg said. And some donated things 
that you'd think they'd never part with -- like the woman who brought four 
quilts made by her mother, saying, "Those people need them more than I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg and a friend also made house calls to pick up items that people were 
unable to deliver themselves. By Sunday, the garage was filled with bags and 
boxes of canned and dried food, shoes, sweaters, comforters, blankets and 
quilts. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a monument to the better side of human nature, the pile stood five feet 
high, eight feet wide and 22 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tapped into something with this," he said. "The lesson for me is that 
people want to help. Sometimes they just need an avenue, they need someone to 
tell them what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Red Cross is sending a truck to the Greenberg residence to pick up 
all that he collected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Greenberg's efforts have been above and beyond what most people are able 
to accomplish," said Al Wynder, the Orange County Red Cross' assistant director 
of financial development and corporate relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the agency doesn't accept donations of food and clothing. But it 
made an exception after the earthquake because so many people called to offer 
what they had, Wynder said. Catholic Charities will distribute the items to 
those in need in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that, Greenberg said, allowed him to shake off the bad feeling he had 
a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a modest guy," he said, "but it sure makes me feel good." RICHARD CORE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; AMTRAK 
ADDS 3RD TRAIN ON ROUTE TO SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A third, round-trip passenger train between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara will 
begin running today to help ease the city's post-quake congestion, the 
president of Amtrak announced.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Downs said the nation's passenger train line also will help Metrolink 
meet the skyrocketing demand for commuter rail service to the Antelope 
Valley.As a contract operator of Metrolink service, Amtrak will help expand 
schedules, find extra equipment, upgrade tracks and provide additional crews 
for the trains, Downs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita line, serving Antelope Valley communities all but cut off 
from the Los Angeles Basin by the collapse of the Golden State and Antelope 
Valley freeway interchange, now runs 21 trains each weekday. Ridership has 
jumped from about 1,000 passenger trips per day to more than 19,000.  
</P>
<P>
 The Amtrak line from Santa Barbara stops at Ventura, Oxnard, Moorpark, Simi 
Valley, Chatsworth, Van Nuys, Burbank Airport, Glendale and Union Station 
before going to San Diego.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GUN MAKER 
GETS 2 1/2 YEARS FOR ROLE IN SKINHEAD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A machinist who pleaded guilty to helping manufacture illegal machine gun 
parts for sale to a white supremacist group was sentenced Monday to 2 1/2 years 
in a federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Berwick, 49, of Santa Clarita was sentenced by U.S. District Judge 
Ronald S.W. Lew, who said it was clear that Berwick had a minor role in a 
conspiracy to help arm hate groups.Berwick pleaded guilty last year to making 
parts for machine guns that a San Fernando Valley couple, Christian and Doris 
Nadal, sold to an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't recognize it, Mr. Berwick, you're getting the lowest term 
possible," Lew said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nadals were convicted on weapons charges last year and were sentenced Dec. 
6. Nadal, 35, got eight years and his wife got more than three years. Berwick 
and the Nadals were among nine people arrested in July on charges of 
manufacturing, possessing and selling machine guns, silencers and explosives, 
and of other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities alleged that it was part of a skinhead plot to kill prominent 
blacks, including Rodney G. King, and bomb the First African Methodist 
Episcopal Church, the oldest black congregation in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant told the judge earlier that he regretted his actions, saying 
that making the weapons parts was "the biggest bad judgment of my life."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; WELFARE OFFICE CLOSE TO GETTING NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county's Social Services Agency is close to an agreement that would 
relocate a controversial welfare office that Anaheim residents have blamed for 
creating crime and loitering at a nearby park, county officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is completing a lease agreement that will move the current Homer 
Street welfare office, near La Palma Park, to a commercial area at 2929 White 
Star Ave., said Robert A. Griffith, chief deputy director of the social 
services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that the deal is also contingent on the county's selling 
the current welfare office site to the city. "That's where the money for the 
new lease will come from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was prompted by complaints from city officials and nearby residents, 
he said, adding that the current office is too old and too small to meet the 
county's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, several council members called upon the county to move the office. 
County officials were willing to relocate, but said they lacked the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner made the relocation a priority of 
his shortly after getting into office last March. He said local community 
groups brought the problem to his attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very encouraged that we are going to move this facility into a more 
appropriate area," Steiner said Monday. "It's something that I've been pushing 
pretty hard for." 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare office has been at its Homer Street location for more than a 
decade and has been a target of complaints for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents charged that welfare recipients loiter in the park and drink alcohol 
or use drugs there after picking up their welfare checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The news that the welfare office relocation was imminent pleased residents 
near the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that we've been working hard for," said Harald Martin, a 
police officer who lives in the area. "We're pretty happy about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and members of a group called Somebody dumped cow manure in the park 
last year to draw attention to the drug use there. 
</P>
<P>
 "By moving the office, they're going to remove the customers of the drug 
dealers," Martin said. "We should see a marked decrease in crime." MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; EX-MWD DIRECTOR SENTENCED TO PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Orange County director of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California was sentenced Monday to three months in prison and fined $10,000 for 
federal income tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl J. Kymla of Costa Mesa, a 20-year member of the MWD board and a former 
city councilman in Newport Beach, also must spend three months in a community 
confinement center during a three-year period of supervised release, according 
to the sentence handed down by U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Kymla is scheduled to turn himself in to begin his sentence March 14, said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Kimberly Dunne. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Kymla nor his attorney, Paul Raymond, returned phone calls for comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kymla, who runs Newport Beach-based Municipal Services Consultant Inc., 
pleaded guilty last October to one count of failing to report approximately 
$75,000 of income on his 1987 tax return, Dunne said. He also admitted failing 
to report approximately $140,000 in income in 1986, Dunne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he faced a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine after 
being indicted in 1993 on two counts of tax evasion, "as part of a plea 
agreement, the government moved to dismiss one count," Dunne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kymla resigned from his seat on the 51-member MWD board last October just 
before entering his guilty plea. He served on the board as a director appointed 
by the Municipal Water District of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 As an MWD director, Kymla had been chairman of the special budget committee 
since its inception in 1976. The committee had the final word on MWD's 
$820-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, Kymla was the general manager of the Moulton Niguel Water District in 
Laguna Niguel and one of five district officials indicted on felony charges of 
misappropriating district property, including using district equipment and 
employees to handle chores around his home. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, prosecutors admitted that their evidence against Kymla was weak 
and charges were dismissed against him in February, 1979. He retired from the 
district post one day later.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; STING YIELDS 3 ARRESTS, 1,976 LBS. OF COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of a joint narcotics investigation unit seized nearly one ton of 
cocaine and arrested three people allegedly involved in the Orange County-based 
conspiracy, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators with the Regional Narcotics Suppression Program, together with 
the FBI, seized 1,976 pounds of cocaine Thursday at an unoccupied Cerritos 
residence, according to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 The cocaine, with an estimated street value of $35 million, was wrapped in 
kilo-sized packages that were stacked in cardboard boxes and loaded in a pickup 
truck in the residence's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Four suspects, all believed to be Colombian nationals, were arrested at other 
residences in Cerritos, Diamond Bar and Redondo Beach, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the three adults arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking 
as: Marina Cardona Hernandez, 47; Juan Castro, 28; and Juan Callos-Cardona 
Cifuentes, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult suspects are all being held in the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified, 16-year-old female juvenile was also arrested and released to 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they believe the Cerritos residence where the cocaine was 
seized was recently leased in order to store and distribute even larger 
quantities of the drug as part of a ring responsible for smuggling throughout 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini noted that the seizure was the first of its kind for the Regional 
Narcotic Suppression Program since the state's Asset Forfeiture Law expired 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The suppression unit is partially funded by seized assets, Martini said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; NEIGHBOR RESCUES MAN, 61, FROM FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire officials Monday credited a quick-acting neighbor with rescuing a man in 
a wheelchair from his burning apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 p.m. Sunday, 61-year-old Richard Masse was pulled from his burning 
apartment in the 12100 block of Bayport Street by his neighbor, Sandy Ramirez, 
according to Ellen Covey, a Garden Grove Fire Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's daughter and a friend called 911 to report the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Joe Chandler said that if Ramirez had not pulled Masse -- who 
is physically disabled and in poor health -- from the apartment, he would 
probably have died in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A second resident of the apartment, Robert Graham, 24, sustained second degree 
burns to his face and was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange for treatment 
and observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials have not determined the cause of the fire, which gutted the 
apartment. There was $60,000 damage to the structure and $20,000 to the 
contents, authorities said. Three residents of an upstairs apartment were also 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Masse and Graham are being provided emergency housing and assistance by the 
Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; BUILDING SCHOOL AT MALL TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of residents are expected to attend a public hearing tonight to offer 
comments on a controversial plan to build a new fundamental intermediate school 
at a local shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, proposed by the Santa Ana Unified School District, calls for a 
$43-million "space-saver" school to be built on a 11-acre site at the rear of 
Bristol Market Place, at 17th and Bristol streets. The district Board of 
Trustees will consider the plan at tonight's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The site for the proposed campus has drawn widespread criticism from residents 
who believe a school there would increase traffic, crime and noise in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say a new school would better serve the community if built 
elsewhere, and charge that the district has failed to adequately investigate 
other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents support the plan as a way to alleviate overcrowding throughout 
the district, and hail the board's recent decision to make the campus a 
fundamental school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamental schools, which are extremely popular with parents, combine 
traditional instructional programs with strict dress codes and behavioral rules 
and strong parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 98,000-square-foot campus would accommodate 1,300 students from sixth 
through eighth grades, easing a space crunch at other intermediate schools, 
said Mike Vail, senior director of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Building new campuses is crucial, he added. By 2000, local intermediate 
schools will house about 5,000 more students than their designed capacities. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the addition of the planned Raymond A. Villa Intermediate School and 
the space-saver campus, the number of intermediate students would still exceed 
designed capacities by about 2,400 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-funded project is designed as an innovative way to maximize the use 
of land, while ensuring that no businesses or homes are condemned to make room 
for the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the project is intended to be a model for other districts statewide, 
it would receive funding priority and be built years earlier than would 
otherwise be possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting will be held at 6:30 at Phillips Hall on the Rancho Santiago 
College campus, at 17th and Bristol streets.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; BOYS CLUB HONORS 1ST WOMAN ON ITS BOARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Donna Bagley will never forget that day in November, 1957, when she was asked 
to join the all-male board of directors for the Boys Club of Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I laughed -- because they were all men," said Bagley, who will turn 82 in 
March. "They told me they needed a mother's viewpoint. This one man thought I 
had the courage to be a pioneer." 
</P>
<P>
 That board member was right. The civic- and community-minded Bagley did take 
that courageous step and accepted the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 She became the first woman to serve on the board. "I was the one that broke 
the ice," she said, adding she found it a "challenge and a responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley, mother of two sons, one of whom died in a car accident as a teen-ager, 
retired from the board this month after 36 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was given the honorary title of "historical consultant" because of the 
wealth of knowledge she has about the club's early years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley has also received another title. Because of her dedication and service 
to the club, she was honored as the organization's "Volunteer of the Year" on 
Saturday at an annual volunteer and donor recognition dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gives a lot of time and effort unselfishly -- and with no pay. And I 
think her heart is in it," said fellow board member Larry Stern, who has served 
with Bagley for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said Bagley has always been in the forefront in coming up with ways the 
club could secure money from donors to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the first one to be there because she's concerned about the kids," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During her more than three decades as a board member -- never serving as 
president because she "didn't want to be president" -- Bagley was instrumental 
in raising money to keep the club open and expanding programs for the youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the club, which is now open to both boys and girls ages 6 to 17, 
has a membership of 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley, who for 35 years operated an income tax service, also managed to find 
time to frequent the club "to let kids know we were interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley has been involved in the community since she and her husband of 50 
years, Wallace, moved to Buena Park in 1948 and bought a home in the city's 
second housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after they moved to the city, Bagley joined the Buena Park Woman's Club 
and has been active in that organization ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Bagley has been publicly recognized for her community 
endeavors and volunteerism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had more satisfaction, more recognition and more awards than any one 
person deserves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But being honored as the club's top volunteer may be the highlight of her 
life, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm overwhelmed," said Bagley, who still cooks, sews her own clothes, knits 
and attends the same church she has belonged to for the past 42 years. "I've 
had so many awards, but I think this may be more meaningful than anything 
that's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley, a grandmother of four, said she was touched when she saw an ad last 
week in the program for Saturday's event that thanked her for her service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just thinking about it brings tears to my eyes," she said. "It means a great 
deal to me to be part of this wonderful organization." 
</P>
<P>
 While getting another award is an honor, the real reward is knowing that she 
has made a difference in the lives of youngsters. "I've tried to be a good role 
model for young people as a caring person," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And being involved in her community is something she will never give up. "This 
is where I belong. I've been a part of Buena Park, and Buena Park is a part of 
me," she said.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FIRE OFFICIALS DISPUTE ALLEGATIONS IN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire Department officials on Monday disputed allegations that a mentally 
disabled man died Thursday because of inadequate fire equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the fire was so intense that no one could have saved Mark D. York, 
34, who died of smoke inhalation when flames engulfed Christian Residential 
Care, a board-and-care home on Candlewood Street. 
</P>
<P>
 His body was found in a bathroom on the bottom floor of the two-story 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garrison, a director of the Westminster Firefighters Assn. Local 2425, 
said that York's death could have been avoided if a firetruck at Station 2, the 
fire station closest to the fire, had not been put out of service last year as 
part of a reorganization of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Herr, the department's chief investigator, found that it would not have 
made a difference if a firetruck, which has special equipment to puncture holes 
on roofs for ventilation, had arrived with the first fire engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Charles V. Smith and Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman have scheduled a 
noon press conference today to answer the union's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. also is scheduled to provide additional 
details about the investigation into the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials described Garrison's charge as irresponsible and premature 
because the investigation had not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest salvo in the continuing feud between members of the council 
and firefighters' union, which is supporting a recall drive against Smith, 
Bohman and Councilmen Craig Schweisinger and Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the firefighters have until Feb. 19 to gather 6,937 signatures 
to force a recall election. BERT ELJERA

SUIT BY DENNY, 3 RIOT VICTIMS CLEARED BY JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge refused Monday to dismiss a lawsuit against the city of Los 
Angeles by trucker Reginald O. Denny and three other 1992 riot victims, 
clearing the way for a trial that may begin later this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Denny, Wanda Harris, Takao Hirata and Fidel Lopez contend that Los Angeles 
police left them at the mercy of their assailants in the neighborhood 
surrounding Florence and Normandie avenues during the early stages of the riot 
because the area is predominantly black. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' 15-year-old son was shot and killed a block from the Florence and 
Normandie intersection, a flash point of the civil unrest. Denny, Hirata and 
Lopez were beaten in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. granted a motion by Assistant 
City Atty. Annette Keller to dismiss claims by the plaintiffs in which they 
allege that they were deprived of their constitutional right to due process of 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the judge said all four plaintiffs can proceed with their claim that 
they were denied equal protection of the law. To prevail in the suit, the 
plaintiffs must prove that the police pulled out of the area because most of 
the residents were African American. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court in 1989 ruled that police departments have no specific 
duty to provide the public with adequate protective services. However, it also 
ruled that the state may not selectively deny protective services to certain 
"disfavored minorities" without violating equal protection of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great day for the plaintiffs," said Denny's attorney, Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr. "This case is real important for everyone," because what happened 
to Denny during the riot showed that anyone could be injured because of 
governmental actions based on race, Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne based his decision partly on a 1989 Ohio federal court decision in which 
white residents of Canton were allowed to sue the city based on claims that 
police were failing to protect them because they lived in a primarily black 
area, said Constance L. Rice, an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, one of three public interest law groups assisting Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have discrimination based on policy, it doesn't matter who the victim 
is," Rice said. "You have to look at what happened (during the riots), and why 
it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union and the Asian Pacific American Legal Center 
also joined in a brief supporting the plaintiffs' contention that their suit 
should be allowed to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he found it ironic that his suit was based on a statute designed to 
benefit minorities, Denny said he felt he was entitled to use the law because 
the police had fled the area. Denny said he and his friends find a good deal of 
what goes on in court perplexing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just a bunch of truck drivers," he said. "The speed limit is 55 m.p.h. 
The only law I know is red lights." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants in the case include the city, former Los Angeles Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates and former Deputy Chief Matthew Hunt, who headed the 
department's South Bureau during the riots. The other defendants are Deputy 
Chief Ronald A. Frankle; Deputy Chief Ronald C. Banks, now chief of staff to 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams; Paul Jefferson, who was a ranking official in 
the South Bureau at the time of the riots and is now the chief of police in 
Modesto, and former LAPD Lt. Michael Moulin, now retired on a stress pension. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar case on behalf of Denny and two of the three plaintiffs in the 
federal suit is pending in Los Angeles Superior Court. Four other cases filed 
by riot victims were dismissed by Superior Court judges, who agreed with the 
city attorney's position that the city is immune from such suits. 
</P>
<P>
 However, none of the suits that were dismissed contained allegations that 
there was racially discriminatory deployment of police resources.

HARASSMENT CLAIM REJECTED ; INQUIRY: STATE AGENCY DECLINES TO ACT ON CHARGE BY 
EX-AIDE OF COUNCILMAN NATE HOLDEN. OFFICIALS GIVE NO REASON, BUT SAID EARLIER 
THAT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS MIGHT HAVE EXPIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A state agency has declined to file a sexual harassment accusation against Los 
Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden that stemmed from complaints by a former 
aide that lewd comments and unwanted advances by Holden created a sexually 
charged atmosphere in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing means that 
onetime Holden aide Connie Collins cannot receive damages through an 
administrative hearing, but she is still free to file a lawsuit against her 
former boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the state agency declined to say Monday why they did not sustain 
Collins' complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the agency said Collins' complaint was problematic because it 
might have been filed after the expiration of a one-year statute of 
limitations. Agency officials would not say Monday if the time limit was a 
factor in their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden's attorney, Tim Agajanian, called the decision "a great moral and legal 
victory for Councilman Holden." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden, in a statement, said he believes that sexual harassment lawsuits by 
two other former employees also will be dismissed. "There was never an ounce of 
truth to what Ms. Collins or my former employees alleged," said Holden, who has 
maintained that the allegations were trumped up to deflate his 1993 campaign 
for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins could not be reached for comment. But Melanie Lomax, who once 
represented Collins, called the state's action "hardly a vindication of Nate 
Holden." 
</P>
<P>
 Lomax said that before she left the case last year, the agency "had already 
raised serious questions about whether the events took place outside the 
statute of limitations." 
</P>
<P>
 Agajanian said the state agency's study of the facts in the case showed that 
Collins "could not have prevailed." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins was the second of three former Holden aides to complain in late 1992 
and early 1993 that Holden had ogled or inappropriately touched them while they 
were his employees at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden vehemently denied the accusations. He contended that Lomax had 
influenced two of the women to file the claims in an effort to block his bid 
for mayor. The councilman said Lomax held a grudge against him because he did 
not vote for her when the City Council rejected her appointment to a city 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits by former employees Carla Cavalier and Marlee Beyda are pending, as 
is Holden's countersuit against Cavalier and Lomax for defamation.

1ST FREEWAY REPAIR CONTRACT IS AWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first major contract for reconstruction of freeway bridges damaged in the 
earthquake was let for $14.8 million Monday and officials said the work on 
Interstate 5 in Gavin Canyon should be completed by early June. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels said the E.L. Yeager Construction Co. 
of Riverside, which won the contract, will earn a bonus of $150,000 a day for 
each day it can beat the 130-day deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, it would take up to a year to complete a job like this," he said. 
"This time, they'll be working 24 hours a day, seven days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said that if the work on the bridges southwest of Santa 
Clarita is completed within 180 days, the federal government will pick up the 
entire tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans regional director Jerry Baxter said his agency is moving swiftly on 
all other freeway reconstruction efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to let the contract for the work on the Santa Monica Freeway on 
Friday," Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract for the Simi Valley Freeway "should follow on the heels of that," 
he said. "We hope to complete all (the freeway reconstruction) within a year."  
</P>
<P>
 Yeager, one of the largest transportation contractors in California, has had a 
hand in many highway projects, including construction of the interchange 
between Interstate 15 and the Riverside Freeway in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm won the contract to rebuild two quake-damaged I-5 bridges with a bid 
of $14,819,000, just $13,000 more than the Caltrans engineers' estimate, Van 
Loben Sels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineers said the work will involve the replacement of two parallel 
bridges in Gavin Canyon -- one for northbound and one for southbound traffic. 
The original bridges, built in 1968 and never retrofitted to increase their 
resistance to earthquakes, collapsed in the 6.6 quake Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers said the bridges failed at points where sliding "hinges" had 
been incorporated to permit the spans to expand and contract with the weather. 
They said that during the earthquake, the horizontal movement was greater than 
the length of the hinges, and the spans pulled away from their supports and 
tumbled into the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bridges will be continuous spans without expansion hinges, the 
engineers said. To allow for expansion, the bridges will rest on sliding 
abutment footings designed to permit more horizontal movement than is expected 
in any earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the reconstruction is completed, two lanes of traffic in each direction 
are being routed over a temporary detour that opened Monday, connecting to The 
Old Road, a section of the original U.S. 99 that predated the Golden State 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful, but I'm afraid tomorrow the rest of the valley will discover 
it," Santa Clarita Valley resident Debbie Gianella said after arriving Monday 
morning at her Downtown office. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said the temporary detours around the damaged I-5, Foothill, Santa 
Monica and Simi Valley freeways generally are "moving pretty well." He said 
motorists seeking alternate routes have created congestion on other highways, 
with the Ventura Freeway between the Hollywood and Glendale freeway 
interchanges now carrying about 7% more traffic than normal. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to ease the congestion on the detours around the shattered Santa 
Monica Freeway bridges over Washington and Fairfax boulevards, transit 
officials have opened a new park-and-ride facility at Constitution Avenue and 
Sepulveda Boulevard in Westwood, served by a new express bus line to Downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the public has been slow to get the word. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning, we had zero ridership," James Okasaki, a spokesman for the city 
Department of Transportation, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials said a new station on the Los Angeles-to-Lancaster line 
opened Monday at Acton as scheduled, with another station expected to open in 
Santa Clarita this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Stanger, Metrolink's executive director, said station platforms in 
Sylmar and Burbank have been lengthened to accommodate the longer trains that 
have run since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of Emergency Services, said 
215,898 people have registered under a variety of federal assistance programs, 
exceeding in only nine days the six-month total of applicants from Hurricane 
Andrew in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, 208,844 have applied for temporary rental assistance, and the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency has responded by mailing out 12,831 checks 
worth $39,398,801. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 7,300 of the applicants have applied for loans from the Small 
Business Administration. The SBA said 550 of those applications have been 
approved, for a total of $16,779,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said 112,783 of applicants have asked for emergency food stamps. Of 
those, 2,168 applications have been denied and 90,323 applications have been 
approved for a total value of $25,477,295. The others are being processed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 people waited in the parking lot at Dodger Stadium to apply 
for a onetime allotment of food stamps, but a new three-day waiting period left 
some disappointed and hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have to wait to get something to eat. It doesn't make sense," said 
Deborah Dennis of South-Central Los Angeles. "I have to wait three days to find 
out if we can go home and have a full meal." 
</P>
<P>
 The wait was enforced to deter cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city's Building and Safety Department said 43,449 structures had been 
inspected by midday Monday, with 26,920 dwelling units declared unsafe for 
occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department, confronted with the problem of trying to 
keep people out of buildings that have been declared unsafe, announced that it 
has drafted a policy for arresting anyone who persists in returning to those 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 That policy, dubbed "three strikes and you're out" by department wags, was 
outlined in a department memo obtained Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that policy, police officers will not usually initiate arrests but will 
wait for requests made by building and safety inspectors, who are notifying the 
city's Emergency Operations Center when they see or hear of people entering 
red-tagged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering any building posted as unsafe is a misdemeanor, but the LAPD policy 
makes clear that arrests will be made as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the arrest may be made anytime the offense is committed, people who 
reoccupy red-tagged buildings will be given two warnings before an arrest is 
made," the memo states. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one exception: If people refuse to leave buildings when asked to do 
so by police, the officers may make an arrest then. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was put together because we had some real concerns" from building and 
safety inspectors, said Capt. Robert J. Martin, author of the memo. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted squads of Metro officers out throwing these people in the 
Bastille. . . . We thought we needed a policy, but we didn't want to go too 
far. These people are not criminals. They're nice people who have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said there were a few flare-ups Friday and Saturday, but that the 
problem seemed to subside by Sunday. "I think it's kind of resolving itself," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District reopened after two 
weeks of structural inspections. At least 21 quake-damaged schools in the 
sprawling district remain closed, but officials said some campuses will reopen 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross said that 4,177 people were still being housed in 30 shelters 
and 518 were camping in tents outside the shelters. The Salvation Army 
sheltered 492 indoors in one shelter and an additional 382 in two tent sites 
erected by the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 * City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council's Budget and 
Finance Committee, estimated that the city will lose at least $33 million in 
revenue as a result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before the earthquake, we were facing an approximately $150-million 
shortfall for the 1994-95 fiscal year," Yaroslavsky said. "With an additional 
$33-million loss, we are looking at a very serious money problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman said utility tax revenues will drop because of power outages, 
closed businesses and destroyed homes. Property taxes will drop because of 
reduced property values, and Municipal Court fines will dip because police 
officers -- diverted to other duties -- are and will not be writing as many 
traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he said, damage to retail businesses will reduce the city's share of 
sales taxes. Business taxes will drop and reluctance to purchase real estate 
will trim documentary transfer tax revenues, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lucy Jones, a seismologist for the U.S. Geological Survey, said the area was 
averaging two or three magnitude 3.0 aftershocks a day -- compared to 150 of 
them on Jan. 17. She said the aftershock pattern should continue to taper off, 
although there could be another 5.0 aftershock in coming weeks.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CAR DEALERS GIVEN PAYMENT PLAN ON BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, acting as the Community Development Agency, has approved a 
request to let the Auto Dealers Assn. pay a $25,000 landscaping bill in 12 
monthly payments instead of one lump sum payment. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto dealers received the bill in August for maintaining the landscaping 
on the slope of the Garden Grove Freeway next to the auto center on Trask 
Avenue, west of Brookhurst Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gary L. Alwood, vice president of the Garden Grove Auto Center, said in a 
letter urging city officials to extend the payment over a period of time that 
"a downturn in the car business made payment difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials recently agreed to the request and will charge a monthly interest 
rate of 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 In cooperation with the auto dealers, city officials in November, 1990, agreed 
to remove tall oleander bushes and other plants that blocked visibility of the 
auto center from the freeway and planted low-lying vegetation at a cost of 
about $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual maintenance cost for the landscaped area is $25,219 a year. The 
Community Development Agency paid that cost for the first 42 months. The auto 
dealers had agreed to continue the maintenance payments after that period. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto dealers also asked the agency to consider funding a replacement of 
the blue face on the Auto Center sign at the center. They said the blue panel 
has been faded by the sun and detracts from the appearance of the sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials asked staff employees to look into the request. The sign replacement 
is estimated to cost $9,000. ROBERT BARKER

 Despite heavy loss to gnatcatcher and cactus-wren habitat from October's 
devastating Laguna Beach fire, construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway 
won't jeopardize the long-term survival of the rare, environmentally threatened 
birds, federal wildlife officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-page biological opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
released Monday, could influence a federal judge whose injunction barring 
tollway construction in the Laguna Greenbelt area issued before the blaze comes 
up for review in March. 
</P>
<P>
 County tollway officials sent a copy of the opinion to U.S. District Judge 
Linda McLaughlin, who had recently asked lawyers in the case brought by 
environmentalists and other toll road opponents to address the fire's impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's opinion is consistent with an earlier finding by the Fish and 
Wildlife agency that the birds were in "no jeopardy" from the tollway 
construction. That earlier opinion was widely disputed by environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it might be assumed that most birds perished in the blaze, the 
results of surveys immediately following the fire . . . suggest otherwise," the 
latest report states. "The best scientific data available suggest the 
approximately 200 gnatcatchers and 190 pairs of coastal cactus wrens persist in 
unburned areas of the San Joaquin Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 The report did not state how many of the two species were lost to the fire, 
though it acknowledges that there were some 400 gnatcatchers before the fire in 
the entire area. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire's impacts are "temporary," the coastal sage scrub habitat crucial for 
survival of the birds "will recover," and the birds will eventually 
"recolonize" the burned area, the report adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway officials hailed the report because it keeps in place a biological 
opinion needed to proceed with construction. And they said they will continue 
to ask McLaughlin to lift the injunction, in part so that erosion control work 
can occur along the tollway path. 
</P>
<P>
 But tollway officials had also argued, ironically, that the injunction was no 
longer necessary because the fire-scorched area had little left to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the biological opinion released today is inconsistent with our 
arguments," tollway spokesman Mike Stockstill said. "We are still moving 
forward with our request to the judge."

HOPEFULS RUSH TO FILE FOR JUNE 7 PRIMARY; POLITICS: VACANT ASSEMBLY SEATS ARE 
BIG TARGETS. BUT DOZENS OF LOCAL OFFICES ALSO DRAW CANDIDATES' ATTENTION. 
</P>

<P>
 The mad dash to fill two Orange County state Assembly seats being vacated by 
incumbents got off to a quick start Monday, as would-be candidates for those 
seats and dozens of other local offices began taking out papers for the June 7 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 For Republicans, who make up about 52% of the county's voters, the start of 
the 1994 election season carries with it the hope of taking away from the 
Democrats the only legislative seat they now hold -- the 69th District seat now 
held by Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove, who is planning a run for state 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats, meanwhile, are hoping to break through the Republican dominance 
by targeting two outspoken congressmen, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). Democrats outnumber Republicans 
in Dornan's district, but they represent only 34% of all Orange County voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two city council members -- Irvine's Barry J. Hammond and Santa Ana's Ted R. 
Moreno -- registered their intent to run for the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 While usually having little impact in the local races, the Libertarian Party 
on Monday demonstrated its continuing campaign to appear on the ballot, with 
seven candidates among the first to take out papers for races ranging from the 
U.S. Senate seat now held by Democrat Dianne Feinstein to congressional and 
state legislative seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Between now and Feb. 9, candidates for Congress, the state Legislature, and 
the county's judicial seats must file declarations of intent to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's June 7 primary ballot also will include the Board of Supervisors 
races in the 2nd, 4th and 5th districts, election of other county officials, 
including the district attorney, sheriff-coroner and the superintendent of 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates for those nonpartisan offices will begin filing their nomination 
papers on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Republicans are focusing on maintaining their grip on local 
legislative seats, most of the interest in recent days has centered in the 70th 
Assembly District, where the incumbent, Republican Gil Ferguson of Newport 
Beach, announced Friday that he would not seek reelection in order to run for 
the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's departure from the Assembly is likely to create an intra-party 
clash. Among the first Republicans to express interest in Ferguson's seat were: 
Irvine Councilman Hammond; Bruce E. Peotter, a Newport Beach lawyer; and Thomas 
G. Reinecke, an attorney and the son of a former California lieutenant 
governor. Several other prominent Republicans have been mentioned as possible 
candidates for Ferguson's 70th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Party activist and Irvine lawyer Jim Toledano also declared his 
candidacy Monday for Ferguson's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one Republican, perennial candidate Virgel L. Nickell, had signed up as 
of Monday for the Assembly seat now held by Umberg, even though capturing that 
seat is a major goal of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The state legislative and congressional districts in central Orange County, 
which have large Latino and Asian American populations, are high on the 
Democrats' list of targeted races. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's expected departure from the Assembly has left Democrats bracing for 
their own intramural battle. As of Monday, four Democrats had declared their 
intent to run in the 69th District: Zeke Hernandez, a Santa Ana resident and 
Latino political activist; Santa Ana Councilman Moreno; Santa Ana resident 
Wayman L. Nelson; and Enriqueta L. Ramos, a Rancho Santiago Community College 
District board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that we do have some work to do since we don't have (Umberg) 
running in that spot," local Democratic Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia said. 
"It sure would have made my life easier had he maintained that seat." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Democrats try to hold on to Umberg's seat, they also will target other 
districts with high Democratic registration numbers, including Dornan's 46th 
Congressional District. Four Democrats have declared their candidacies so far, 
as well as one Republican and one Libertarian.

HIGH COURT DENIES INSURANCE PAYOUT IN OVERDOSE; LAW: STATE JURISTS SAY FAMILY 
CANNOT COLLECT ON A PORTION OF COVERAGE BECAUSE MAN COULD HAVE EXPECTED 
PROBLEMS FROM COCAINE USE. THE RULING DRAWS A FINE LINE FOR DEATHS CAUSED BY 
'ACCIDENTAL MEANS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The California Supreme Court held Monday that the Orange County survivors of a 
man who voluntarily ingested cocaine and died of an overdose cannot collect 
life insurance benefits intended to cover deaths by "accidental means." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 5-2 decision, the court said that the death was not caused by "accidental 
means" because the deceased could have reasonably anticipated that death or 
great bodily injury would occur from ingesting a hazardous, illegal drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling leaves California in the minority of states that distinguish 
insurance coverage for accidental death from death caused by "accidental 
means." Under the latter definition, a fatality that results from an 
intentional action that could lead to death would not be covered, according to 
one of the attorneys on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Courts around the country have abolished the distinction because it is a 
distinction without meaning," said Santa Ana attorney Richard A. Cohn. "To 
uphold the distinction simply allows the Supreme Court to choose when and where 
it wants to draw the line. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The case was brought by the Santa Ana mother and sister of Michael P. Weil, 
who died at 32 of a cocaine overdose. Weil, an engineer in the semiconductor 
industry, was in San Francisco on business in 1985 and was staying at one of 
the city's most elegant hotels when he ingested enough cocaine to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Kemper Life Assurance Company paid his mother and sister, Lola Brown 
Weil and Michelle Weil of Santa Ana, $100,000 as beneficiaries of the life 
insurance policy but refused to allow them to collect another $100,000 under an 
accidental death rider in the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial court and a Court of Appeal ruled against the insurance company, which 
appealed the case to the state's high court. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . It is clear," said Justice Ronald George, writing for the majority, 
"that California cases in a variety of factual settings have interpreted 
policies affording coverage for death effected through accidental means to 
preclude coverage for voluntary and intentional conduct that results in 
unintended death." 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Stanley Mosk and Joyce Kennard, the most moderate members of the 
conservative court, dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that the survivors are entitled to collect under the policy 
because the overdose was accidental. "In all cases in which the insured's act 
was more than negligent but not tantamount to suicide," Mosk wrote, "the 
insured can reasonably expect to be covered."

RESIDENTS OF SHANTYTOWN LOOKING FOR NEW HOMES; DISPUTE: ABOUT 40 PEOPLE SAY 
THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO LEAVE THE MIGRANT CAMP CALLED PORTERVILLE BECAUSE OF A 
LAND FEUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Caught in the middle of a protracted land dispute between their landlord and 
neighboring homeowners, the 40 or so people living in a migrant camp known as 
Porterville said Monday they are seeking homes elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Luis Ocampo, spokesman for the shantytown community, said the tenants 
have received a 15-day notice from landlord Sam Porter and "everyone here is 
looking for a place out there, and some are already moving out." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Trabuco Highlands Community Assn., court order in hand, locked 
a gate that seals off Porterville from its only access road. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the only way for the tenants to get out of the camp was either by 
walking more than a mile along a dry creek bed or through the gate -- but only 
if they had all their belongings packed in their vehicles, never to be let back 
in again, Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in July, 1992, Porter and the William Lyon Co., developer of the Trabuco 
Highlands subdivision, signed an agreement that gave the homeowners association 
the right to build the gate at the entrance to Porterville, which lies at the 
foot of the Saddleback Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement allowed Porter and his immediate family to have keys to the 
gate, and Porter was allowed to have guests in his 233-acre ranch for up to 
seven days, said homeowners association spokesman Don Chadd.  
</P>
<P>
 However, said Chadd, the agreement did not contemplate the use of the gate by 
Porter's tenants, who pay about $50 a month each to live in dilapidated 
trailers, campers and cabins. Chadd said the traffic and noise generated by the 
tenants in the streets of Trabuco Highlands forced the association to take a 
tough stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an obligation to the people we represent to find a solution to the 
problem," Chadd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter on Monday alleged the entire matter stems from racism. He said his 
tenants are allowed to work in nurseries nearby but not to live next to those 
they work for. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's "views and determinations are racially motivated," he said. 
"These people are being victimized and exploited. If anyone ever asks if racism 
exists in Orange County, let them look to Porterville." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chadd said nothing could be further from the truth. Porter, he said, was 
"grasping at straws" and not taking responsibility for his own actions. He said 
Porter created the problem by disobeying county zoning and health regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has tried to dismantle Porterville over the years, citing numerous 
fire, safety and health code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation, Chadd said, "is unfortunate but unavoidable. My heart goes out 
to these people." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ocampo, the shantytown spokesman: "The only way out is to get out of 
here, so we're out of here."

DAMAGE TO COLISEUM CLOUDS FOOTBALL SEASON; QUAKE: SOME FEAR STADIUM MAY HAVE TO 
BE TORN DOWN. A REPORT ON ITS STATUS IS EXPECTED IN TWO WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Earthquake damage to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is so extensive that 
the historic stadium might not be repaired in time for next fall's football 
season, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 One Coliseum aide said that a structural engineer's report is pending, but 
there is a possibility it might have to be demolished and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the officials now believe that the costs of reopening the 
stadium could vastly exceed the estimate of $35 million made last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials have not foreclosed the possibility of repairing and 
reopening the facility -- which was red-tagged Sunday by city building 
inspectors -- in time for the next football season, but they concede that time 
is short, and that work is contingent on a quick decision by federal 
authorities to assume most of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Monday that 
consideration of Coliseum aid could take time, and added that 
earthquake-damaged schools would have a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the Coliseum's future were reports Monday in Eastern publications 
that the Raiders have been exploring a move from Los Angeles to either Hartford 
or Baltimore. Attendance at Raiders games in the recently completed season was 
often disappointing even though the stadium was renovated to make it more 
suitable for viewing football. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to bring an NFL franchise back to Baltimore, officials in Maryland have 
courted the Rams as well as the Raiders. Members of the Maryland Stadium 
Authority met in New York City on Jan. 20 with John Shaw, Rams executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw was asked to provide "a letter of interest" to satisfy local politicians 
that the Rams were seriously considering a move from Anaheim Stadium. But a 
source close to the Rams said it was unlikely that the club would provide the 
letter because it might limit the team's negotiating position as they consider 
whether to leave Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams notified the city of Anaheim last month of their intention to invoke 
the escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium lease, but not until May 3. Under 
terms of the clause, the Rams would have to remain a tenant of the stadium for 
15 months, or through the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the announcement, the Rams became a target for not only Baltimore, but a 
number of other cities who are anxious to attract an NFL team such as St. 
Louis; Memphis, Tenn.; Hartford, Ct.; Sacramento and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles officials continued assessing the earthquake damage at 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 During a tour of the stadium Monday, Don C. Webb, the Coliseum Commission's 
project director for recent renovations of the facility, said a fairly complete 
report from structural engineers is expected in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A (crack) runs through the concourse, through the tunnels and into the base 
of the foundation," Webb said. "What we don't see is extremely important. The 
question is whether this (facility) can be fixed, or whether it will have to be 
demolished." 
</P>
<P>
 But the principal structural engineer retained to assess the damage said he 
believes that demolition will not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahih Youssef said, "Technically, the Coliseum still has capacity to withstand 
earthquakes. There is a lot of damage, but it is not all to the lateral 
earthquake resistance system of the building. There is some residual strength 
and we can build on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a separation of the outer Coliseum wall from the superstructure," 
Youssef said. "The outer structure was displaced differently from the inner 
side, where the seating is located. . . . But the structural integrity may not 
have been fatally compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Youssef said, Saturday's magnitude 5.0 aftershock caused 
additional damage at the Coliseum, and the $35-million estimate of damage made 
last week is too low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Repairs will take six months to a year," once they begin, Youssef said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, who also toured the facility and has 
an engineering degree, said he believes the lower levels of the Coliseum are on 
"solid ground" and that most of the damage is confined to the "higher tier" at 
the concourse, or upper concessions and restroom level, and above. 
</P>
<P>
 "The higher tier will have to be taken down and replaced," he said. "It's 
going to be very expensive. But I think repairs are feasible, and we are 
applying to FEMA for funding." 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming Coliseum Commission president, County Supervisors Chairwoman 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, said she had been informed "it would not necessarily 
be required to remove the entire upper tier." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum has no earthquake insurance, officials said, and no appreciable 
funds in reserve for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Hagerman, the Coliseum's general manager who was present for Monday's 
tour, declared that everything is contingent on what the structural engineer 
reports about the severity of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tour drew to a close, Webb, Hagerman and Margaret Farnum, executive 
secretary to the Coliseum Commission, noticed for the first time that the Los 
Angeles Department of Building and Safety had red-tagged the Coliseum. A sign 
posted on the outer fence at the peristyle end declared that it was unsafe to 
enter. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign said it had been posted at 11:30 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the city's chief building inspector, Russell Lane, said he took a team 
to the Coliseum on Sunday, but they were unable to enter the locked facility. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the judgment had been made to red tag the building based on cracks 
visible from the outside, and that city inspectors had yet to observe the 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the principal damage displayed Monday by Webb and Hagerman was a deep 
crack running the entire length of the upper level concourse, which the two 
officials said showed how the Coliseum's outer wall had separated from the 
inner seating structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaps could be seen between sections of seating, and chunks of fallen concrete 
littered parts of the concourse. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the lower part of the stadium seating, built in the early 1920s, 
had sunk away several inches from the upper section, which was added for the 
1932 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also serious cracking of some pillars and beams in the Peristyle end 
of the stadium -- the only facility in the world to have hosted two of the 
modern Olympic Games, and the site of a World Series and many important 
political and entertainment events. 
</P>
<P>
 "One problem we have is that different parts of the stadium moved in different 
directions," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Hamlin, a spokesman for FEMA, stressed that fast action is necessary if 
there is to be any chance of getting the facility ready for next fall's 
football games by the Los Angeles Raiders professional franchise and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 A USC spokesman said Monday the school will await the engineer's report before 
commenting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders did not return calls for comment.

QUAKE UPENDS SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN REAL ESTATE; HOUSING: WITH 30,000 DISPLACED, 
NEW RENTERS ABOUND. WHILE SOME HOME SHOPPERS RETREAT, OPPORTUNISTS RUSH IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake that turned so many lives upside-down has also upended 
supply and demand in the Los Angeles-area housing market, bringing unlikely 
relief to many long-suffering property owners but only renewed grief to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and landlords whose wallets have been thinning for months because 
they were not able to sell their vacant houses or rent empty apartments say 
that they are now besieged by tenants displaced by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, buyers who want to avoid Northridge and other communities at the 
quake's epicenter are spilling over into surrounding areas, creating a 
mini-sales boom from Woodland Hills to Agoura on the west and across the San 
Gabriel Valley in the east, real estate agents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many home shoppers have retreated to the sidelines while the ground 
continues to shake from aftershocks. Hundreds of home sales are in limbo 
because lenders are insisting that properties be reinspected for damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some opportunists have rushed in, hoping to pick up a bargain in a housing 
market that only recently had emerged from a prolonged and severe recession. 
Harried salespeople and lenders are working overtime, helping the new clients 
while trying to salvage the deals already in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like trying to navigate through the Bermuda Triangle," said Jamie 
Ramstead, a Northridge real estate agent trying to save the six sales he has in 
escrow while also repairing $60,000 in damage to his home. "Most of us have 
never been through something like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake rendered more than 15,000 homes and apartments unlivable, throwing 
more than 30,000 people onto streets from Santa Monica to Simi Valley, 
according to city agencies and disaster relief officials. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many families looking for new places to live, sellers who have lost 
thousands of dollars while their vacant homes sat unsold in a depressed market 
have been flooded with calls from prospective renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Kennedy has been making the $950-a-month mortgage payment on her home in 
Canoga Park that she vacated in July after finding a new job in Oregon. The 
house sustained little damage from the quake, so she flew back to Los Angeles 
last week and leased it to a displaced Northridge family for $1,850 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure I'll recoup what I've lost by the summer, and then I'll be making 
good money because the family signed a one-year lease," said Kennedy, who 
reviews contracts for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for all those people who lost their homes, but it's nice to 
finally make something off this house. The last six months have bled me dry." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has also been a boon for sellers in many San Fernando Valley 
communities that were spared the most serious damage. Thus, some would-be 
buyers are steering clear of hard-hit Northridge and Reseda in favor of nearby 
Woodland Hills and north into southern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Bolin, sales manager of the Coldwell Banker real estate office in 
Woodland Hills, said his agents sold half a dozen properties over the weekend 
-- even though many buyers stayed home to watch the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the quake, we'd be happy with just three or four sales," Bolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many put their home-buying plans on ice after the quake hit, some new 
buyers have moved in to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Lipson, vice president of an executive search firm, lost her 
$535-a-month rent-controlled Santa Monica apartment in the quake. Because it 
would cost her twice that for a comparable apartment, she wants to buy a 
condominium, hoping her mortgage interest deductions will keep her housing 
expenses at a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good deals on the Westside right now," Lipson said. As a 
bonus, she added, "it's a little easier to tell which buildings are well-built. 
Some of them have just fallen apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not all of those new buyers are being welcomed by real estate agents or 
their sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Lamb, co-owner of Century 21 Lamb Realty in Northridge, said she and 
her staff have gotten several calls from investors hoping to pick up homes at a 
tiny fraction of their normal prices.

 "We've gotten our share of bottom-feeders, but they're not having much 
success," said Lamb, whose home sustained major damage during the quake. "The 
law says that we have to present their offers to our sellers, but there's 
nothing that says we have to like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many buyers and sellers who were waiting for escrow to close when the quake 
hit are in limbo. About 1,000 deals were pending in the San Fernando Valley 
when the earthquake struck, according to the local realtors association. A few 
hundred were in escrow in Santa Monica and adjacent communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lenders are requiring that every house they had agreed to finance in the 
county be reinspected for damage. As a result, some appraisers and inspectors 
have been busy taking a second look at properties more than 75 miles from the 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house I'm buying in Sherman Oaks didn't get hurt a bit, but I can't close 
the deal because my (appraiser) is busy looking at houses down in Long Beach," 
said Nick Smith, who drives a delivery truck. "The whole thing is stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 An informal poll of about a dozen real estate offices in the San Fernando 
Valley and on the Westside found that about 10% of all purchases in escrow at 
the time of the earthquake have been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our customers are going through with their sales, although we've had 
to renegotiate some of the terms," Lamb said. "It takes a little extra work for 
us and might add a few days of delays, but nobody has called up in a panic and 
said they want their money back." 
</P>
<P>
 Those words are of little comfort to Rhoark Rollband in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollband had been trying to sell his condominium for nearly a year before the 
earthquake hit, and had reduced the asking price for his two-bedroom loft to 
$124,000 from $129,000. The local housing market was showing signs of picking 
up, and he was confident the home would sell soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rollband's unit weathered the quake, the temblor damaged several 
other buildings at the sprawling complex on White Oak Avenue and knocked out 
gas service for nearly two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has slashed his price again -- this time to $109,000 -- and is willing 
to take even less to make a quick sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meet my price, and I'll even throw in my furniture," said Rollband, a 
salesman who says the quake persuaded him that it is time to move to Denver. "I 
just want to cut my losses and get out of L.A. as fast as I can."

ILLICIT DRUG USE BY YOUTHS SHOWS MARKED INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Illicit drug use by teen-agers increased significantly between 1992 and 1993, 
driven by a dramatic rise in the use of marijuana and more use of stimulants, 
LSD and inhalants, federal officials announced Monday, noting that the trend 
reverses the downward patterns seen in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "These findings are more than a warning signal," Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna E. Shalala said at a press conference to announce the results 
of the annual survey of nearly 50,000 8th-, 10th- and 12th-grade students. 
"They are an urgent alarm we must heed at once." 
</P>
<P>
 To convey the growing sense of urgency, three Cabinet officers -- Shalala, 
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley and White House Office of Drug Control 
Policy Director Lee P. Brown -- announced the results of the annual survey 
together, pledging to step up efforts to alter the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 While similar studies for Orange County teen-agers are not complete, officials 
on Monday said that local drug use appears to be stabilizing, with no 
significant trend shifts in the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Fair, a manager with the Orange County Health Care Agency, said that 
among those teens seeking treatment, the drug used most often is marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting a trend in the general population, youths in treatment have shown 
increased use of LSD, according to Fair. But counselors also have noticed a 
drop in the use of cocaine and of several drugs at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Shalala said she plans to contact the presidents of broadcast 
networks, film studios, record companies and professional sports leagues to 
urge them "to rededicate themselves to getting the message out about 
prevention." Brown said he will convene a national meeting of experts in 
prevention and drug education to confront the problem of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drug use among American young people has been making a clear comeback in the 
past two years," said Lloyd Johnston, the University of Michigan research 
scientist who conducted the survey, adding that the nation had "been lulled 
into a false sense of security" by declining numbers in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Bennett, who first headed the drug policy office during the George 
Bush Administration, immediately blamed the Clinton Administration for the 
increases. "Although we still have a serious drug problem in America, the 
Clinton Administration has been nearly invisible on the drug issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration's most prominent voice on drugs," Bennett said, "has been 
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and her favorable words about drug 
legalization." He was referring to Elders' suggestion that the issue of drug 
legalization should be studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
said the new pattern "emphasizes the need for immediate action in fighting both 
drugs and crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The increases "are in part the result of an erosion of anti-drug attitudes by 
youth," said Richard A. Millstein, acting director of the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse. "Now more than ever, we need to counter erroneous messages that 
glamorize the use of illicit drugs, alcohol and cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings cut across all socioeconomic levels and showed that "contrary to 
conventional wisdom," black students reported the lowest rates of use for 
virtually all drugs, Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey, which has been sponsored annually since 1975 by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, the percentage of high school seniors who 
reported using an illicit drug at least once in their lives increased from 
40.7% in 1992 to 42.9% in 1993 but still remained well below the peak level of 
65.6% recorded in 1981, the report said. Nevertheless, the 1993 increase 
reverses a downward trend of use by 12th-graders that began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of any illicit drug in the past year by high school seniors increased from 
27.1% in 1992 to 31% in 1993 after steadily declining from a peak of 54.2% in 
1979. Those seniors who said they had used an illicit drug within the last 
month increased from 14.4% in 1992 to 18.3% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of marijuana increased by three or four percentage points during the 
last two years among 8th-, 10th- and 12th-graders, according to Johnston. In 
1993, the proportion of students reporting marijuana use in the previous year 
was 9% for 8th-graders, 19% for 10th-graders and 26% for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put another way, the proportion of 8th-graders using marijuana has increased 
by half in the last two years, while the proportion of 10th-grade users 
increased by about a quarter and the proportion of 12th-grade users by about a 
fifth," Johnston said. Although the rates are well below the peak levels 
reached in the late 1970s, "they clearly represent a reversal of the declines 
we recorded for more than a decade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also showed that legal drugs -- alcohol and cigarettes -- still are 
the most widely used among the nation's youth at all grade levels. Two-thirds 
of eighth-graders and nearly nine-tenths of seniors have tried alcohol, the 
report said.

OASIS FOR ABANDONED CHILDREN IN TIJUANA; HAVEN: LAGUNA BEACH ENVIRONMENTALIST 
HELPS TURN BARREN REFUGE INTO A GARDEN FOR YOUNGSTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just south of the international border lies an improbable oasis for abandoned 
children. In this six-acre haven are redolent edible gardens teeming with mint, 
rosemary, cilantro, cauliflower and mango and orange trees, among other flora. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty and aroma clash absurdly with the horrid smell of burning refuse 
rising from the shantytown just below, a barren place that a travel-weary 
Mother Teresa once stated had poverty "I have never seen anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aldeas Infantiles shelter, one of the few green spots in this parched city 
of about 2 million people, is partly the creation of a True Believer, Bill 
Roley of Laguna Beach. He is an anthropologist, horticulturist and all-around 
ecologically and environmentally correct dynamo who prizes compost as much as 
he does the looks and life-giving quality of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In this "museum of food," as Roley calls the shelter, he has turned loose his 
imagination, considerable green-thumb knowledge, and academic experience to 
create what he hopes is a living model for a city beset by poverty and 
overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Roley, the 46-year-old son of a Marine Corps colonel, is teaching the 
shelter's 22 children to become self-sufficient, to recycle nearly everything, 
and to teach others the value of seeds and soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is that they're responsible for the waste that comes out of their 
house and their kitchen; that they need to recycle it into compost," he said. 
"They're responsible for the chores around the kitchen, which has earth gardens 
that can be used (to grow) medicinal or culinary plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of a "ruptured society," as Roley described them, the children living 
at the shelter are the product of broken homes; of adolescent mothers or 
abusive parents who abandoned them or were forced to give them up. 
</P>
<P>
 And here, in the rows of romaine and baby lettuce, parsnips and peppers, is 
where Roley believes their recovery lies, where hope is nurtured and their 
futures are forged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to teach the children not only how to be emotionally strong, 
we're going to teach them how to be ecologically and environmentally strong," 
said Roley, who belongs to several ecological and educational organizations 
involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, he said, the gardens will yield enough produce that the children 
will be able to establish a small store to sell the excess to the public. He 
said the shelter, shaded and protected from the elements by its greenery, will 
be more self-sufficient and less dependent on outside food sources and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Pulido, president of the foundation that runs the shelter, said the 
experiment is opening eyes in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shelter is a reality that must be shown to be believed," he said. "Once 
it was nothing more than a barren hill with buildings where nothing could grow. 
Now it is a miracle, an example of how the methods applied can work here." 
</P>
<P>
 Roley earned his doctorate in anthropology at UC Irvine in 1976 and currently 
teaches environmental planning at Cal State Fullerton and ecological survival 
at the Center for Regenerative Studies at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Roley and his occasional business partner and ecological soul 
mate, Scott Murray, a landscaper and farmer who lives in northern San Diego 
County, were approached by the SOS Kinderdorf International Foundation. The 
organization -- which has created about 1,100 children's shelters throughout 
the world, including Tennessee and Louisiana -- asked Murray and Roley to help 
beautify a new shelter in Tijuana for a $25,000 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinderdorf wanted to use the ecological techniques developed by Roley and his 
Permaculture Institute of Southern California to design drainage channels, 
ecological landscaping and six more houses to complement the seven existing 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roley and Murray first arrived at the site, they knew the job was not 
going to be easy. The foundations of the two-story homes had been damaged by 
rain. Moreover, tons of construction debris had been dumped at the edge of the 
property, creating a porous slope upon which rain had carved five-foot-wide 
crevices, a clear sign of erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Americans also realized that the place, about a mile uphill from 
Tijuana's Central Bus Depot, was particularly vulnerable to the wind as well as 
the noise created by the heavy traffic moving toward Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the project turned into a labor of love for the two Americans. By 
their own account, their fee would, over the two years, work out to the 
equivalent of $1.50-an-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job mushroomed into a much larger job than we had committed to," Roley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, soon the two men found a few allies, including the Morelos State 
Park nursery and nurseries throughout Orange County, which donated several 
hundred trees. Tijuana's Caliente Racetrack donated several hundred tons of 
compost from its stalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Roley and Murray designed an intricate water harvesting system, reconditioned 
the soil, including the eroded slope, and planted citrus, olive, fig, banana, 
mango, palm and acacia trees, bougainvillea, vines and a myriad of edible and 
medicinal plants. 
</P>
<P>
 They also established contact with an organization creating an eco-park near 
the shelter using recently developed water-treatment techniques. These 
ultimately may be used to create a permanent source of water for the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they have helped create an environmental school at the site that 
is becoming a model for schools throughout the region, according to Roley and 
local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school is becoming a magnet for environmental awareness. The ecological 
classroom is seen as a model for some of the things (Tijuana residents) would 
like to do, things we have done here," Roley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who once ran a farm in Mexico that produced out-of-season fruits and 
vegetables for U.S. restaurants, said that he and Roley were simply drawing on 
old techniques that they believe should be adopted by the city of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the cutting edge of a 10,000-year-old technology," said Murray, who, 
during his college days at UC Santa Cruz back in the early 1970s, was one of 
the first to promote the idea of agro-ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the pioneers of the sustainable future where things don't get 
progressively worse, they get better and better," he said. "We've tried to 
build something here that 20 years from now will be financially sustainable. 
We've established a system that will get better and better." 
</P>
<P>
 Although 22 children are housed at the shelter, about 100 more are expected 
within the next couple of years, said shelter director Guillermo Arriaga. It 
all depends, it seems, on how fast the "dynamic duo," as Roley and Murray are 
called by their Mexican partners, can gather volunteers and donations to finish 
the rest of the buildings and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito Espinoza Montalbo, a 9-year-old boy whose short stature and slight 
build belies his age, is among the smallest helpers. During a recent visit by 
the San Diego-based People for Trees organization, Benito was the first to 
volunteer in the planting of several trees brought by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 His story is not unlike the others' here. Abandoned by abusive parents two 
years ago in the town of Tehuacan, Puebla, he and his sister Liliana, 13, were 
picked up by Kinderdorf's Aldeas Infantiles in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito said his parents "would beat us up with a cable (cord) or whatever 
else" they could find. He said he liked planting trees, the smell of the 
flowers he grows, and the good people who take care of him at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the boy cannot forget his mother. "I would like to see her again, grow 
a flower and give it to her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the Kinderdorf organization, created after World War II in Austria, 
is not only to raise single children, but also to keep siblings together in a 
family atmosphere, according to Arriaga. Children like Benito and Liliana will 
stay together in the shelter until they reach maturity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocio De Osuna, the wife of Mayor Hector Osuna Jaime and head of the city's 
family development agency, is impressed with the shelter and would like the see 
the same program started at the dozens of agency day care centers, 
kindergartens and orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a program of family gardens, but without all the variety offered by 
the Aldeas Infantiles shelter," she said. "I would really like to have 
something like that for us and I'm going to see to it that we do."

DAMAGE TO COLISEUM CLOUDS FOOTBALL SEASON; QUAKE: SOME FEAR STADIUM MAY HAVE TO 
BE TORN DOWN. A REPORT ON ITS STATUS IS EXPECTED IN TWO WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Earthquake damage to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is so extensive that 
the historic stadium might not be repaired in time for next fall's football 
season, officials said Monday. One Coliseum aide said that a structural 
engineer's report is pending, but there is a possibility the building might 
have to be demolished and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the officials now believe that the costs of reopening the 
stadium could vastly exceed the estimate of $35 million made last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials have not foreclosed the possibility of repairing and 
reopening the facility -- which was red-tagged Sunday by city building 
inspectors -- in time for the next football season, but they concede that time 
is short, and that work is contingent on a quick decision by federal 
authorities to assume most of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Monday that 
consideration of Coliseum aid could take time, and added that 
earthquake-damaged schools would have a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
 During a tour of the stadium Monday, Don C. Webb, the Coliseum Commission's 
project director for recent renovations of the facility, said a fairly complete 
report from structural engineers is expected in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A (crack) runs through the concourse, through the tunnels and into the base 
of the foundation," Webb said. "What we don't see is extremely important. The 
question is whether this (facility) can be fixed, or whether it will have to be 
demolished." 
</P>
<P>
 But the principal structural engineer retained to assess the damage said he 
believes that demolition will not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahih Youssef said, "Technically, the Coliseum still has capacity to withstand 
earthquakes. There is a lot of damage, but it is not all to the lateral 
earthquake resistance system of the building. There is some residual strength 
and we can build on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a separation of the outer Coliseum wall from the superstructure," 
Youssef said. "The outer structure was displaced differently from the inner 
side, where the seating is located. . . . But the structural integrity may not 
have been fatally compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Youssef said, Saturday's magnitude 5.0 aftershock caused 
additional damage at the Coliseum, and the $35-million estimate of damage made 
last week is too low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Repairs will take six months to a year," once they begin, Youssef said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, who also toured the facility and has 
an engineering degree, said he believes the lower levels of the Coliseum are on 
"solid ground" and that most of the damage is confined to the "higher tier" at 
the concourse, or upper concessions and restroom level, and above. 
</P>
<P>
 "The higher tier will have to be taken down and replaced," he said. "It's 
going to be very expensive. But I think repairs are feasible, and we are 
applying to FEMA for funding." 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming Coliseum Commission president, Board of Supervisors Chairwoman 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, said she had been informed that "it would not 
necessarily be required to remove the entire upper tier." And while "some real 
fast moving" would be necessary to reopen the Coliseum by the football season's 
first game, she believes political pressure will be considerable on FEMA to 
promptly come up with the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum has no earthquake insurance, officials said, and no appreciable 
funds in reserve for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Hagerman, the Coliseum's general manager, who was present for Monday's 
tour, said that everything is contingent on what the structural engineer 
reports about the severity of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 During the tour, Hagerman expressed exasperation that cracks in the facility's 
superstructure and gaps between its sections have grown deeper and wider since 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tour drew to a close, Webb, Hagerman and Margaret Farnum, executive 
secretary to the Coliseum Commission, noticed for the first time that the Los 
Angeles Department of Building and Safety had red-tagged the Coliseum. A sign 
posted on the outer fence at the peristyle end declared that it was unsafe to 
enter. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign indicated that it had been posted at 11:30 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the city's chief building inspector, Russell Lane, said he took a team 
to the Coliseum on Sunday, but they were unable to enter the locked facility. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the decision to red-tag the building had been based on cracks that 
could be observed from the outside, and that city inspectors had yet to examine 
the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the principal damage displayed Monday by Webb and Hagerman was a deep 
crack running the entire length of the upper level concourse, which the two 
officials said showed how the Coliseum's outer wall had separated from the 
inner seating structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaps could be seen between sections of seating, and chunks of fallen concrete 
littered parts of the concourse. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the lower part of the stadium seating, built in the early 1920s, 
had sunk away several inches from the upper section, which was added for the 
1932 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also serious cracking of some pillars and beams in the peristyle end 
of the stadium -- the only facility in the world to have twice been the site 
the modern Olympic Games, as well as the site of a World Series and many 
important political and entertainment events. 
</P>
<P>
 "One problem we have is that different parts of the stadium moved in different 
directions," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb also expressed concern that the earth berm on which the Coliseum was 
built is alluvial fill that may have been substantially weakened by the 
earthquake and could have compromised vital structural elements of the 
facility. Farnum, who has worked for the Coliseum Commission for 25 years, said 
she was shocked when she viewed the damage the day of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the 1971 (Sylmar) earthquake, the structural engineers told us the 
Coliseum was well protected against quake damage," she said. "We had only 
minimal damage then." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Coliseum officials Monday expressed confidence that federal funds 
would pay for most of the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 N. Matthew Grossman, the outgoing commission president, said, "I just can't 
imagine doing away with the Coliseum and all the history that has gone with it. 
I just can't accept that kind of alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Hamlin, a spokesman for FEMA, said under guidelines adopted for the 
Northridge earthquake, the federal government will pay 90% of the cost of 
repairs on appropriate public facilities and matching funds from state and 
local government need total only 10%. In the past, the split has most 
frequently been 75%-25%. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Hamlin said, any federal action will have to await a complete engineers 
report and then the amount appropriated may be contingent on such factors as to 
how old the facility is, how much deterioration existed before the earthquake, 
and how much of the damage was covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Both he and Webb stressed that fast action is necessary if there is to be any 
chance of getting the facility ready for next fall's football games of the Los 
Angeles Raiders professional franchise and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 A USC spokesman said Monday that the school will await the engineer's report 
before commenting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders did not return calls for comment. There were reports on Monday in 
eastern publications that the Raiders have been exploring a move from Los 
Angeles to either Hartford or Baltimore. Even after renovations to make the 
stadium more suitable for viewing football action, Raider attendance in the 
recently completed season was often disappointing.

ADMINISTRATION TO ASK $2 BILLION MORE QUAKE AID 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration will ask Congress today for about $2 billion more 
in federal earthquake relief than it had previously announced -- which would 
make the disaster-assistance package for the Northridge quake the costliest in 
U.S. history if approved, administration officials said Monday.

<P>
 Citing still-rising damage estimates, a flood of relief applicants and the 
impact of serious aftershocks, the Administration is boosting its request for 
housing grants, small business loans and other federal aid to $8.6 billion. In 
addition, nearly $900 million in federal funds has already been committed to 
the quake-ravaged region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding more and more damage," Richard Krim, the associate director of 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told a House subcommittee Monday. "You 
look at a building, it looks OK from the outside, then you go in and start 
seeing cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 The President was to send the expanded aid proposal to Capitol Hill this 
morning. The House Appropriations Committee was scheduled to begin legislative 
consideration today. 
</P>
<P>
 The new request includes another $1.2 billion for FEMA, which coordinates 
government response to disasters and administers emergency aid. About 
two-thirds of the funds will be earmarked for housing assistance and social 
services for those whose homes were damaged or destroyed by the Jan. 17 
Northridge quake. Most of the remainder would be used to make schools and other 
public buildings less prone to damage in future earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $550 million will be added in Small Business Administration disaster 
assistance loans for businesses and homeowners, nearly doubling the $559 
million originally sought. 
</P>
<P>
 The aid bill will also include an increase of $50 million to $100 million in 
housing vouchers for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, nearly 
$50 million in new funds for the Veterans Administration to repair the damaged 
V.A. Medical Center in North Hills and $100 million for a presidential 
contingency fund to be spent on quake-related costs as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 With the additional funds, the quake relief measure would surpass record sums 
spent by the federal government on other large-scale disasters. A total of $8.5 
billion has been spent on a joint aid package to repair damage caused by 
Hurricanes Andrew in Florida and Iniki in Hawaii and Typhoon Omar in Guam, all 
of which struck in 1992. About $4.7 billion has been channeled to the 
Midwestern communities devastated by last year's floods. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude 6.6 pre-dawn temblor killed at least 57 people and inflicted 
extensive damage on homes, freeways, businesses and public structures. A 5.0 
aftershock on Jan. 29 caused further losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the country fails to realize that not only was this a severe 
earthquake but it was right in the middle of a major urbanized area," said a 
senior Administration official. "The damage to homes is largely uninsured and 
the damage to infrastructure far exceeds what one would expect from a 
hurricane." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that, while the increased aid package may raise objections from 
some lawmakers, the Administration remains hopeful that the emergency 
assistance bill will still command broad support. 
</P>
<P>
 "If members of Congress study the justifications we provide, there should be 
no serious problem," the senior aide said. "People generally seem to respect 
the principle of treating these victims the way we've treated victims of 
previous disasters." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has received more than 215,000 requests for housing and 
other individual assistance at disaster centers throughout the earthquake area 
and projections indicate that figure could go as high as 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration reports that it is receiving 1,000 
applications daily and expects the tally to exceed 200,000. In comparison, the 
agency received 110,000 applications in the wake of Hurricane Andrew and 90,000 
after the floods. 
</P>
<P>
 The official did not rule out future aid but said that the latest figures 
include "both the damage we know and our projections of what we may discover. 
The aftershocks make it a moving target." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said that the larger aid package indicates 
that the Administration is demonstrating "good faith" in its vow to seek more 
funds if more damage is documented. She said that the total could yet rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the numbers justify it, it will go higher," she predicted. "The numbers 
seem to be documenting these increases." 
</P>
<P>
 The full House is expected to consider the earthquake bill Thursday. Senate 
action will follow. Proponents aim to have the measure on President Clinton's 
desk by the time Congress adjourns for a week on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake relief proposal is not expected to prompt significant 
opposition, said Administration and congressional sources. Rather, the biggest 
battles are expected over conservative efforts to force budget cuts elsewhere 
to pay for assistance and initiatives to prohibit aid from going to illegal 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) said Monday that the lawmaker plans 
to introduce an amendment to the relief package today that would restrict funds 
in the bill to citizens and legal residents of the United States. She said this 
would apply to direct assistance, such as SBA loans or housing vouchers, but 
would exclude emergency medical care or food. 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels that by reimbursing these people, we're rewarding illegal behavior," 
the aide said. She added that Packard plans to introduce similar amendments to 
every spending measure that Congress considers this year.

GREENSPAN SIGNALS INTEREST RATE HIKE; ECONOMY: CENTRAL BANK MAY HAVE TO RAISE 
BORROWING COSTS TO PREVENT A NEW SPURT IN INFLATION, FED CHIEF WARNS. ACTION IS 
NOT EXPECTED UNTIL MARCH AT EARLIEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Congress Monday that his 
agency may have to raise interest rates to prevent the economic recovery from 
triggering a new spurt of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the current short-term rates -- less than 3% for three-month 
Treasury bills -- as "abnormally low," he said that, unless there is an 
"unexpected and prolonged weakening of economic activity, we will need to move 
them to a more neutral stance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, which is scheduled to meet 
Thursday and Friday, must consider "when is the appropriate time to move to a 
somewhat less accommodative level of short-term interest rates," Greenspan said 
in testimony before Congress' Joint Economics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Fed will have to decide how long to "continue monetary 
accommodation without sowing the seeds of another bout of inflationary 
instability accompanied by steeply rising long-term rates." However, action on 
interest rates is not expected by economists until March at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, responding to Greenspan's remarks, told reporters at the 
White House later Monday that he hoped any increase in short-term rates would 
not be followed by an increase in long-term rates, "because there's no need to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've still got good, strong growth in this economy," he said. "But we want 
to manage it with real discipline; that is, we don't want to have one of these 
roller-coaster things. We want the economy to grow in a very stable, solid way 
and, obviously, low interest rates are critical to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made it clear that he expects cooperation in the effort to hold down 
both inflation and interest rates: 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider that part of the kind of compact that we've all made where we'll 
continue to reduce the deficit, and we've got to keep inflation down and 
interest rates down so that people can afford to borrow money and invest." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's comments were couched in the customary cautious language that 
members of the Federal Reserve Board use when addressing the sensitive issue of 
interest rates. But they nevertheless signaled a readiness to move toward 
higher interest rates, as well as a heightened concern that the economic muscle 
being exercised throughout much of the nation -- struggling Southern California 
is the major exception -- must be watched carefully so that growth is not 
allowed to ignite inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve chairman and other economists emphasized the need to shift 
from longstanding policy and strike preemptively against inflation because, 
once prices begin to rise, the dramatic steps needed to bring them under 
control risk creating a recession. Taking action in advance of solid evidence 
that inflation is occurring, however, goes against conventional economic 
procedure, in which measures are put in place only after specific data 
indicates they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve's decisions have impact far beyond the financial 
instruments it controls -- its own short-term loans to commercial banks, for 
example. Other short-term rates usually follow the Fed's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher rates make it more expensive for businesses to borrow and expand; they 
put a leash on inflation, but also on the creation of jobs by retarding overall 
economic activity. On the consumer level, increases imposed by the Federal 
Reserve eventually can translate into higher rates for auto loans and 
adjustable-rate mortgages, as well as for bank deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 More generally, statements by Federal Reserve officials are so widely 
respected that they tend to become self-fulfilling prophecies. A forecast of 
good times ahead, for example, can send Americans scurrying to make just the 
kinds of investments that promote economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funds rate, the rate charged for overnight loans among banks, hit 
a peak of 9.75% in 1989. The rate has held steady since September, 1992, when 
it fell to a nearly 30-year low of 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he said that "the foundations of the economic expansion are looking 
increasingly well-entrenched," Greenspan said that the expansion has been 
uneven and that weakness abroad has restrained U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, accelerating domestic economic activity "has put some upward 
pressure on prices." 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time inflation pressures are evident, many imbalances that are costly 
to rectify have already developed and only harsh monetary therapy can restore 
the financial stability necessary to sustain growth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation in 1993 was 2.7%, the lowest rate since 1965, with the exception of 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's comments coincided with a high-flying day on Wall Street, during 
which the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.93 points, to close at a record 
high of 3,978.36. At the same time, the bond market was mixed, with traders 
largely discounting the prediction of higher interest rates because anxious 
investors already had anticipated such increases. 
</P>
<P>
 During Monday's hearing, Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the Joint 
Economic Committee, urged Greenspan to delay as much as possible imposing any 
increase in interest rates, "given the limited number of indicators that 
inflation is around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Bros. in New York, praised efforts to 
take action in advance of clear evidence that inflation is occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that any action before March is unlikely, because the next set of 
economic figures -- those for January -- would be skewed by the freezing 
temperatures in the East and the earthquake in California.

'THREE STRIKES' BILLS SWEEP STATE ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to the public's election year outrage over crime, the Assembly on 
Monday approved five "three strikes" measures aimed at locking up habitual 
criminals for life, and sent the bills to the Senate where one or more are 
likely to pass within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has endorsed the toughest measure, almost identical to the 
"three strikes and you're out" initiative that backers are trying to place on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly approved that measure, authored by Assemblymen Bill Jones 
(R-Fresno) and Jim Costa (D-Hanford), by a 59-10 vote. The other "three 
strikes" bills cleared the Assembly by margins of 64-2, 66-2, 64-1 and 63-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a similar bill could not get out of committee. But after several 
highly publicized crimes and the onset of the election year, legislators are 
acting with unusual haste to show their support for tough crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "The locomotive is moving pretty fast," Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa 
Clara), an opponent, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) said he expects that the upper house will 
pass "a very strong version" of the "three strikes" concept. Roberti, the 
incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the bills will reach 
the committee next week. But he also suggested that the Senate may meld the 
measures into a single bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The action comes even though the cost of the measures remains unknown. 
Wilson's Department of Finance completed a preliminary cost analysis of the 
Jones-Costa bill but has not released it. The California Department of 
Corrections is working on a more detailed analysis. The legislative analyst has 
issued an early estimate that the Jones-Costa bill would cost billions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones scoffed at the cost arguments raised by the few opponents, pointing to 
the incalculable price of allowing violent criminals out of prison to commit 
more crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why can't we have zero tolerance for crime?" Jones demanded as he urged the 
lower house to approve his measure. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pointed to another number of more immediate concern to lawmakers -- a 
Field Poll that found 84% of voters in California support the "three strikes" 
initiative. It is an astonishingly high number given that the backers have not 
completed gathering enough signatures to place the initiative on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 An Assembly committee voted down the "three strikes" bill by Jones and Costa 
last year. But Assemblyman Bernie Richter (R-Chico) recalled the line about the 
definition of a conservative as being a liberal who has been mugged, and jabbed 
at the converts by saying: "The definition of a conservative is a bunch of 
liberals who have been reading public opinion polls." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jones-Costa bill focuses on criminals who commit a third felony, after 
having been convicted of two serious or violent felonies. A three-time loser 
would face either an indeterminate sentence of 25 years to life in prison with 
the possibility of parole, or three times the length of the sentence for the 
third crime, whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent felonies include murder, kidnaping, rape and armed robbery. Serious 
felonies, which are defined in the penal code, include furnishing drugs to a 
minor and residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Reynolds, the initiative's proponent, has endorsed the Jones-Costa bill, 
and said he will drop his initiative if the governor signs the bill into law. 
He began pushing the "three strikes and you're out" initiative after his 
daughter was murdered in 1992 by a repeat felon, and after the bill stalled in 
the Assembly last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three strikes bills are: 
</P>
<P>
 * A measure by Assemblyman Richard K. Rainey (R-Walnut Creek) to impose 
sentences of life in prison without parole for people who commit a third 
violent or serious felony. The vote was 62-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainey's bill, which focuses on violent offenders, is narrower than the 
Jones-Costa bill and would imprison fewer habitual criminals. Rainey's bill has 
the support of the California District Attorneys Assn., which helped draft it. 
</P>
<P>
 * A measure by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) to impose sentences of 
life in prison without parole for people who commit a third violent felony. His 
measure excludes several crimes that are in the Jones-Costa bill. The vote was 
66-2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two identical measures by Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia) to impose 
life without parole on anyone who commits a third violent felony. The votes 
were 64-1 and 63-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jones-Costa bill was approved despite a last-minute attempt by Assemblyman 
Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) to scuttle it by raising the ironic possibility that the 
bill -- and the initiative -- could abolish the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Both measures state that they do not affect the penal code section on special 
circumstances, which allows for either life in prison without parole or the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bates argued that the language is ambiguous on whether death could still 
be an option. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's written really poorly," Bates said. "At least they ought to know what 
they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Costa, both death penalty proponents, said they disagreed with 
Bates' analysis, but said they are considering amending the measure in the 
Senate to make it clear that the bill would not affect capital punishment. 
Amendments may be made to the bill moving through the Legislature, but not to 
the initiative.

CLASH IN MOGADISHU RAISES FEARS OF INCREASED VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Marines clashed with Somali civilians Monday in what some officials said 
could be a harbinger of the worst possible ending to the U.S. intervention in 
the East African country: the prospect of a series of last-minute attacks as 
American troops withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, came as U.S. forces began the 
final phase of their promised March 31 pullout. American officials said that 
the Marines fired only after they were fired on by Somali snipers, but Somali 
civilians said there was no such provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight Somalis died in the incident, and several were wounded. It was unclear 
whether the dead were gunmen or were unarmed. U.S. officials said they were 
investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, diplomats and military officials have been predicting that Somalia's 
long-feuding clan leaders -- including Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid -- will reach 
an interim political settlement, enabling the United States to meet the March 
31 deadline without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, officials here are sharply divided over the outlook for the 
next few weeks, with some worrying that the situation could deteriorate 
rapidly, eventually leading to a return of the devastating anarchy that 
prevailed before U.S. forces arrived in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one really knows -- it could go either way," said a senior U.S. diplomat 
who has been close to the situation. "We're watching it from day to day." 
</P>
<P>
 Incidents such as Monday's clearly are on the rise. Last week, Somali 
militiamen opened fire on a U.N. convoy, seriously wounding a Saudi soldier. 
And gangs of guerrillas went on a rampage in the central town of Belet Huen, 
looting a U.N. warehouse and forcing British relief workers to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 By planners' reckoning, the U.S. withdrawal, which began in early December, is 
right on schedule. About 3,100 of the 7,600 U.S. ground forces on duty in 
Somalia then -- mostly logistics troops and a few combat units -- have left. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-February, officials said, only about 2,500 U.S. ground troops will 
remain on Somali soil, and by March 31 the entire U.S. military contingent will 
be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington continues to bank on the notion that the warlords -- Aidid in 
particular -- will become convinced that launching any attacks between now and 
the U.S. departure date is not in their interest and could bring new 
destruction that might weaken them as leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Although headlines in the United States have focused on the 18 U.S. servicemen 
who were killed in an abortive Oct. 3 raid against Aidid, thousands of Somalis 
have died in clashes with U.N. forces in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials contended that many of Aidid's key lieutenants now recognize 
that and do not want to risk the possibility of hundreds more casualties among 
their own people. "The last thing they want to do is have a confrontation with 
the United States," one diplomat asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Monday's incident demonstrated, the possibility of continuing 
confrontations between departing U.S. troops and Somali militiamen is acute, 
and the prospect that the Somalis will "test" the U.N. forces that stay behind 
is even greater. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Clinton Administration, which previously appeared to 
underestimate the threat that the Somali militiamen posed, is taking extra 
precautions to protect the Americans' flanks as the last of the U.S. units pull 
out: 
</P>
<P>
 * Military officials said that the United States will keep enough combat 
forces -- as well as tanks and attack helicopters -- in Somalia to quell any 
major disturbances until the last U.S. units are ready to depart. 
</P>
<P>
 * The withdrawal will be gradual, with American troops closely covering the 
seaport and airport in Mogadishu -- the debarkation points for U.S. personnel 
and equipment -- right up until the end. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Pentagon also has ordered a second 2,200-man Marine expeditionary unit 
to join the one now stationed off the Somali coast through the final weeks of 
the withdrawal and first few days of U.N. occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 * And the United States and its allies have stationed additional warplanes at 
the sprawling U.S. base in Diego Garcia, a British island in the Indian Ocean, 
in case hostilities erupt. Also on tap are AC-130H gunships. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that how much of this arsenal will be needed is anyone's 
guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior U.S. diplomats are scheduled to meet with key clan leaders in Kenya 
this week to help hammer out a political settlement, amid what some consider to 
be optimistic signs that the outlines of an interim agreement may be within 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the talks with Western officials, Somali chieftains themselves have 
been negotiating behind the scenes, and diplomats said that both clan elders 
and religious leaders have begun talking about some sort of power-sharing 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
 The key question is over how to divide up the participation in any new 
government. "That's what they've been thrashing around in Nairobi," a U.S. 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, with U.S. prodding, the United Nations is moving to address 
some of Aidid's most pressing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council is preparing a new resolution -- which could pass this 
week -- expected to mandate a much-reduced U.N. role after the U.S. withdrawal. 
The measure calls for "voluntary" disarmament, with modest U.N. aid to those 
clan factions that go along. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the diplomats have become more optimistic, U.S. strategists worry 
that the situation on the streets has become potentially more dangerous -- 
particularly in Mogadishu. 
</P>
<P>
 According to reports from that city, Somali youths toting M-16 rifles and 
AK-47 assault weapons once again have become fixtures downtown. Militiamen have 
taken over some key checkpoints. And violence is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's nightmare is that Somali militiamen will launch an eleventh-hour 
attack on departing U.S. forces, reminiscent of North Vietnam's rout of Saigon 
in 1975. The visions of American forces caught in a panicky retreat from there 
by helicopter still are fresh in planners' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. forces already are training Malaysian and Pakistani troops, who will take 
over the bulk of the enforcement burden after the Americans leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But senior U.S. officials said that they are worried that the U.N. forces may 
be hampered by the same ambiguous strategy and chain of command that have 
plagued U.N. operations throughout the Somali venture.

COLUMN ONE; CHANGES FLOW ON AT PUMPS; SELF-SERVE IS ONLY PART OF THE GAS 
STATION REVOLUTION. NEXT MAY COME 'ENERGY FUELING PLAZAS' WHERE YOU CAN FILL 
UP, SEND A FAX AND DROP OFF THE LAUNDRY. BUT DON'T EXPECT A TUNE-UP.

 When Joe Namson got into the service station business after World War II, 
attendants skittered around customers' cars to wipe dust from the fenders and 
clean the floor mats -- even for drivers who bought only a couple gallons of 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at Namson's station on a well-trafficked corner in Sherman Oaks -- a 
sturdy survivor of the Jan. 17 quake -- patrons perform their own service, such 
as it is. Their credit is approved at the pump, through a direct satellite link 
to Unocal Corp. The average fill-up takes 1 minute, 9 seconds flat. 
</P>
<P>
 While stations around his close down, the victims of grinding competition, 
Namson slices his profit margin on self-serve regular gas to as low as 2 1/2 
cents a gallon. He inspects his operation daily -- especially the underground 
fuel tanks; if he misses a problem, the sanitation, fire, occupational safety 
and environmental regulators may descend. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the most dramatic transformation in the history of retail 
gasoline sales, Namson and thousands of other dealers around the country are 
keeping their eye on the horizon, for even more change is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The next incarnation of the service station -- what some like to call the 
"energy fueling plaza" -- will invite drivers to pull in to buy a tank of 
gasoline or natural gas and a loaf of bread, send a fax or pick up the laundry 
or grab a Big Mac to go. Lube jobs and traditional gas-pump repartee -- 
perhaps, someday, human contact of any kind -- aren't part of the vision.

 "It's not that much fun anymore," sighs Namson, 75, who used to know all his 
regulars by name. "There's no personal touch between customers and the dealer. 
And now it's even more impersonal. You go stick the card in the pump. Even the 
guy in the booth doesn't get to know anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two decades, Namson's tidy corner of the world petroleum industry 
-- like tens of thousands of stations across the country -- has been caught up 
in massive change that runs far deeper than the dust on his customers' 
windshields. 
</P>
<P>
 Erratic oil prices, changing customer demand, costly environmental rules, 
high-volume competitors -- and, less obviously, the development of more 
durable, reliable cars -- have buffeted the gas station business. 
</P>
<P>
 Namson's corner, at Van Nuys and Ventura boulevards, has supported a service 
station since 1932, when the boxy Model A was the nation's favorite auto. 
Namson has been in the business nearly as long -- 45 years, 30 at this site. 
</P>
<P>
 He's one of the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, more than 226,000 traditional full-service stations existed 
nationwide. Today, fewer than half that number are still in business -- but 
there are more than 70,000 self-serve mega-stations and an equal number of 
convenience stores that also sell gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to clean your windows and check the tires," said one gasoline 
marketing veteran. "Now we try to sell you doughnuts -- at $4 each." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Before the mid-1970s, oil companies competed by marketing cheap, low-octane 
"fighting grades" of gasoline in what became an industry of gaudy gas wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers wooed customers with free chickens, cigarettes, Hula-Hoops, 
flashlights, coffee mugs and trading stamps -- as well as the occasional mink 
coats and Cadillacs. In 1969, Namson tripled tire sales -- from 30 to more than 
100 a week -- with a promotion touting "Bare-Bottom Prices" on placards carried 
by bikini-clad models, ignoring neighbors who condemned the display as obscene. 
</P>
<P>
 The graciousness and the goodies all but ended with a quiet meeting Oct. 17, 
1973, in Kuwait City. To little notice in the United States, then obsessed by 
Watergate, the Arab world's oil ministers had agreed on an embargo -- primarily 
aimed at punishing America for supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War, which 
had erupted 11 days earlier. On top of existing gasoline shortages, the embargo 
quadrupled crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 What followed was a revolution in gasoline marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers decided that gasoline was a commodity -- that a gallon of one brand 
performed pretty much like a gallon of another. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, although some differences remain in additives from brand to brand, 
federal pipeline regulations by the early 1970s essentially had set national 
standards for octane and other gasoline characteristics. Consumers tried 
off-brands and found -- to their surprise -- that their cars ran fine. 
</P>
<P>
 So when prices soared under the embargo, thousands began regularly refueling 
at the cheapest place in town. 
</P>
<P>
 That put dealers in a squeeze. Most are independent entrepreneurs, paying fees 
to use the oil company's brand name whether they own their station and the land 
under it or lease them from the company. Like many small-business owners, 
dealers can make a comfortable living -- when the economies of their industry 
are favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prices were rising at the pump, however, dealers found themselves in 
a vise. Their profits were held down by Nixon Administration price controls. 
Also, as the embargo took hold, each station's fuel supply was rationed. 
</P>
<P>
 So while Arab producers and big U.S. oil companies enjoyed record revenues as 
world crude oil prices skyrocketed, U.S. dealers -- often with nothing in their 
tanks to sell -- faced lines of angry motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, it was a hairy situation," said Don Smith, editor of the 
venerable National Petroleum News. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25,000 service stations -- more than 10% of the nation's stock -- 
closed in the two months after the Kuwait City meeting. Those that toughed it 
out were forced to operate as cheaply as possible, with most choosing the 
supermarket strategy of low profit margins and high volume. And they did it 
mostly by firing the help and putting in self-service pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, self-service was a Los Angeles innovation, introduced by 
independent Urich Oil Co. in 1947. Self-serve stations had become pesky 
competitors to the major full-service chains in the 1960s -- particularly the 
coin-operated Gasamat chain in 11 Western states and the distinctly low-rent 
Hep-Ur-Sef stations in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Texas and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 But until the embargo, the major oil companies had fought off self-service by 
enlisting fire marshals -- in part with stories of explosions caused by smokers 
standing too close to the pumps -- who in turn encouraged state legislatures to 
declare self-service unsafe. To this day, Oregon and New Jersey ban public 
sales of self-serve gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, 85% of all gasoline sold in the United States is pumped 
self-service -- the single biggest transformation in retail gasoline history. 
And with the shift has come the huge, low-price stations in prime locations 
that the industry calls "pumpers." 
</P>
<P>
 Pumpers wield powerful economies of scale. A central attendant can take the 
money for dozens of pumps. Such new operating costs as environmental cleanups 
can be spread over higher gross sales. 
</P>
<P>
 When Joe Namson and his brother, John, took over a station on the Westside 
after World War II, they became a hot success by jumping sales from 5,000 to 
30,000 gallons a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some big oil companies try to dump franchisees unless they pump at least 
100,000 gallons a month. These days, Namson, who gets a daily tank-truck load 
of gasoline from Unocal, sells more than 200,000 gallons a month. Some 
big-volume stations pump up to 500,000 gallons a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's going for volume," Namson says warily, "but the pie is only so 
big." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The latest plague on dealers is a steady fall in demand for gasoline in recent 
years. New cars are more energy efficient. And the economy has been stalled, 
reducing companies' need to transport goods and people. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, low world crude prices have kept an ocean of petroleum on 
the market. That has kept prices at the pump, adjusted for inflation, at 
1947-era lows. Profits have sagged for dealers and oil company marketing 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the oil companies have tightened their belts. Most have moved to 
concentrate retail stations near refineries -- to cut transportation costs and 
get the biggest bang for their regional advertising buck. Across the country, 
stations have been traded, sold or shut down -- whether the local operators 
liked it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal is closing 20% of its California stations. Arco retreated to the West 
Coast after 1985, trimming its network of stations from 3,900 in 18 states to 
1,600 in California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Texaco swapped 92 
Northern California stations for 84 Exxon stations in California and Nevada; 
since 1989, Texaco has closed more than 3,200 of its 17,000 stations 
nationwide. Chevron in the last decade has shrunk its service station network 
almost 30%, down to 8,700 stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 After a particularly bitter battle with its Southern California dealers, Exxon 
just pulled down its signs from stations that held a 3.4% share of the market 
in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, former Exxon dealer Ray Daryaie has raised the Mobil flag at his 
station at White Oak Avenue and Ventura Boulevard in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Daryaie invested $600,000 to buy the gas station, washing his hands 
of a career as an architect and interior designer. "So much bankruptcy, 
husbands and wives divorcing," he recalls of his former life. "This way, I take 
my money home at the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 And the gas station's profits? "Fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 At least they were in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, dealers set their pump price, based on wholesale prices, operating 
costs and whatever the traffic will bear -- considering, always, the 
competition across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Daryaie had a gross profit margin of 12, 13 even 16 cents a gallon. 
By the end of 1990, it was down to 6 or 8 cents. After Exxon announced it was 
pulling out, the margin dropped to 3 to 5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the same period, the rent he paid Exxon climbed from $5,600 to $9,500 a 
month, Daryaie says, and environmental compliance costs, license fees and taxes 
ballooned as dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Small-business operators have few choices about making ends meet in tough 
times. Daryaie started with 36 employees and 12 service bays for tuneups and 
minor repairs. Now he has 12 employees and six service bays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oil company would not reduce their margin," Daryaie says. "We had to do 
it, to stay alive. . . . I had to sell my life insurance. I had to cash in all 
my savings, everything I had, little by little." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, he's back to the rough industry standard of an 8-cent profit 
margin. And he hopes to expand. Daryaie expects to add a tire sales and 
alignment franchise and a carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 But he won't try to do more repair work. The oil change, lube and repair side 
of the business -- known as the "back room" in dealer parlance -- is a dying 
proposition for most stations. The villain? Mainly the much-improved 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, many auto makers recommended lubrication and oil changes 
for new cars every 1,000 miles, and new tires and tuneups every 15,000 to 
20,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Better lubricants, the steel-belted radial tire and other advances have 
changed the schedule to a lube and oil change at about 7,000 miles and a tire 
change at 40,000 to 50,000 miles. Cadillac's Northstar engine, with platinum 
spark plugs, is being promoted as capable of going 100,000 miles before its 
first tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, the expensive diagnostic equipment demanded by highly specialized 
on-board computers is sending more drivers to dealerships for tuneups when they 
are needed. And many busy drivers have taken to getting routine fluid changes 
at independent quick-stop chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some station operators are reluctant to give up their back rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Yee has had repair bays for the last 16 years at his Eagle Rock station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry thinks snack shops and convenience stores are the way to go, not 
repair," says the Shell dealer. "But that's not for me. I love this 
neighborhood repair business. You meet a lot of people and it's more 
profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arco -- a company apart in the sometimes lock-step retail gasoline business -- 
decided quite the opposite back in the early 1970s. The first major brand to 
embrace self-serve pumps, the company drastically restructured to aim at 
low-price, high-volume sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In the prime station locations it retained, Arco buried larger storage tanks. 
It serviced them with bigger trucks: tankers that carried 1,800 to 2,000 
gallons were replaced by 8,500- to 9,000-gallon models, greatly reducing the 
cost of supplying the Los Angeles company's stations. 
</P>
<P>
 And Arco replaced most of its repair operations with AM/PM Mini Market 
convenience stores. Arco also started its own chain of quick-lube shops and 
Smog Check stations, dumped credit cards and revamped its refineries to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Today -- with about 90% fewer stations than it had in 1975 -- the company 
sells a third more gasoline. And it is experimenting with two-acre plazas that 
include pumps, convenience stores, lube shops and other operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are conducting their own experiments. Unocal, Conoco, Amoco and Sunoco 
are putting alternative fuels -- mostly propane, methanol and natural gas -- on 
the pump islands. "We want to bring alternative fuels to Main Street U.S.A.," 
says Shel Vedlitz, Conoco's alternative fuels marketing manager. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chevron, which introduced the first direct satellite hookup for paying at 
the pump -- on the same satellite used by National Public Radio -- is looking 
hard at the burger business. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco-based company has half a dozen stations on the same site 
with Taco Bell outlets in the Dallas area and a Burger King/Chevron operation 
in Miami. Mobil has a similar trial with McDonald's at a station in Bricktown, 
N.J., and two in Naples, Fla. -- although the company says badly chosen sites 
and other problems doomed two West Coast experiments with Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's looking for the magic bullet," says William Berghoff, Chevron 
general manager of brand services. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea -- the buzz of the industry -- has merit, retail gasoline analyst 
Trilby Lundberg says. "Fueling the tank and the tummy? Truck stops have known 
about this for years," Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, personal service continues to wane. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called ghost stations -- automated, 24-hour sites that don't require 
attendants -- have been discussed for years by various big marketers but have 
not caught on. But in Oregon, 40,000 fleet customers -- from taxi companies to 
dump truck contractors -- now use 300 such stations around the state.

CABLE NETWORKS TO UNVEIL PLAN ON VIOLENT PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Threatened with regulation by Congress, the major U.S. cable networks will 
unveil a plan this morning to control portrayals of violence in their 
programming. Among the steps will be establishment of an outside monitor to 
report annually on the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Cox, president of the Showtime network, will make the announcement on 
Capitol Hill on behalf of the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes as efforts are under way in Congress to write legislation that 
would impose government curbs on television broadcasters and cable companies in 
an effort to protect children from graphic portrayals of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials familiar with the cable plan said that it also includes an agreement 
to establish a rating system for violent programming, as well as endorsement of 
a new technology that would allow parents to keep violent programs from being 
broadcast in their homes. The plan, entitled "Voices Against Violence," has 
been approved by board members of the National Cable Television Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox networks also reportedly are preparing to 
announce an independent monitoring plan developed in closed-door negotiations 
with Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), long an advocate of reducing violent programming 
on television. Officials said that the network monitoring system would be 
separate from that of the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon had threatened to sponsor legislation to establish a federal agency to 
monitor violent programming if the networks were not able to agree on a system. 
</P>
<P>
 In congressional hearings last year, members of the House and Senate berated 
television broadcasters and cable operators for what they termed gratuitous 
portrayals of violence. Leading psychologists testified to a link between 
on-screen violence and violent crimes by young people. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, executives pledged to clean up the industry. In July, the major 
TV networks announced that they would begin this fall using a parental advisory 
label for violent programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno added a stern warning from the 
Clinton Administration. Testifying before a Senate panel, Reno said that the 
television industry must voluntarily reduce violence or "government action will 
be imperative." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the parental advisory labels and establishment of industry 
standards to discourage gratuitous violence are "positive . . . but extremely 
small steps." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said that the Administration is prepared to support tough legislation to 
deal with the problem. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) has sponsored a bill to 
restrict violent programming to late-night hours. Other bills would require the 
Federal Communications Commission to issue periodic reports listing programs 
that contain the most violence as well as their commercial sponsors. They also 
would mandate on-screen warning labels and advance notification of violent 
content in TV listings and would seek to discourage the advertisement of 
violent programs during family shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable industry's plan supports legislation by Rep. Edward J. Markey 
(D-Mass.) for a blocking mechanism on TV sets, known as a V-chip, that parents 
could use to screen out violent programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan supported by the cable industry calls for a voluntary rating system 
that would "have the participation and support of the entire television 
industry, including the broadcast networks and independent stations." However, 
some broadcast officials said last year that they were unlikely to agree to a 
ratings system and they have not supported the V-chip. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the cable plan also calls for "responsible scheduling" to 
avoid airing violent programs during hours when children might be watching.

IN GAZA, FEAR OF ANARCHY TRIGGERS ILLEGAL-ARMS BOOM; MIDEAST: PALESTINIANS 
WORRY ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL WILL LEAVE VOID IN WHICH FEUDS, POLITICAL VIOLENCE CAN 
GROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Soon after Monsour Shawa was appointed mayor of Gaza City, a friend called to 
congratulate him and recommend a first order of business: Buy a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "He offered to sell me one -- a 9-millimeter automatic," said the prominent 
Gaza businessman. "I said, 'What's the price?' When he told me, I said, 'No 
thank you, I'll take my chances.' " The price: $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the cost of weaponry is soaring -- just three months ago, a 
9-millimeter pistol went for a third that amount -- Gaza's black market in 
illegal arms is booming. The reason: fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Shawa, Palestinians throughout the occupied territories have been 
scrambling to stock up on pistols, machine guns, assault rifles and ammunition 
in recent months, most of them desperate for a measure of personal protection 
in advance of Israel's promised withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 For Israel, the weapons proliferation illustrates an issue that has been 
central to the delay in its troop withdrawal, originally scheduled to begin 
last Dec. 13 and put off for at least another week late Sunday when talks 
between PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres 
ended in Switzerland without a final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly out of fear of an even larger influx of firepower into their back yard, 
Israeli negotiators have been insisting that their troops maintain military 
control of the border crossings into the new Palestinian entity. The 
Palestinians have insisted that policing the borders is critical to their new 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The border controversy was at the top of the list of tentative weekend 
compromises made by Arafat and Peres. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the growing gun problem in the territories is a concern as 
human as it is political. It is the shared worry among Israelis and 
Palestinians that the dawning of a new age of autonomy after nearly three 
decades under strict military occupation will bring a new era of anarchy as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of confusion and fear in Gaza for ordinary people," said 
Shawa, whom Arafat named chief executive of the capital of the emerging 
autonomous Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fear of the unknown, a fear that if there is no law, no order, no one 
to settle feuds, there is going to be a period of trouble. People are desperate 
to have protection." 
</P>
<P>
 The run on guns in Gaza has driven the price of a U.S.-made M-16 rifle to 
nearly $9,000 -- a jump of $2,000 in two months. A Russian-made AK-47 goes for 
$6,500. The price of a single bullet that sells for 30 cents in Israel now 
costs $4 in the occupied territories, a premium that has drawn children to 
scavenge at Israeli army firing ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinians, and some Israeli lawmakers, blame the Israeli military for 
the proliferation of arms. Israeli troops still control the territories' 
borders, and critics assert that border guards deliberately permit the weapons 
and ammunition to pass through their checkpoints from Egypt and Jordan. In a 
land where such conspiracy theories are common after 27 years of 
sometimes-harsh military occupation, those critics suggest that the Israeli aim 
is to fuel future infighting among the territories' many Palestinian factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Mordechai Gur flatly denied that charge last 
week, and sources in the Israel Defense Forces called the allegation "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Gur's denial, delivered in the Israeli Parliament, or Knesset, reflected the 
elevation of the gun issue to an integral part of Israel's national debate on 
the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to charges by Israeli legislators that the army is ignoring the 
arms surge in the territories, Gur confirmed in the Knesset that Palestinians 
in the territories are stockpiling weapons. But he insisted in his testimony 
that the Israel Defense Forces are working hard to track down and destroy arms 
caches in Gaza and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you even conceive of such a thing?" Gur asked the legislators who 
raised the issue. "Is it even conceivable that we would treat a flow of weapons 
to the Gaza Strip calmly, when our soldiers are in the strip and fighting in 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Gur said, the military is intensifying its weapons searches 
throughout the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 There was ample evidence in recent weeks to support his assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week in the small West Bank village of Aboud, Israeli soldiers conducted 
a weapons search as destructive as it was meticulous at a Palestinian house 
that is now riddled with holes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the home of Mahmoud Abdul Majid, whose five sons were arrested in early 
January as suspected Palestinian terrorists. Two of the boys were released two 
weeks later. The other three were kept in an Israeli jail for further 
interrogation. Last week, the army returned to the Abdul Majid's house and 
systematically began taking it apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The family showed a visiting reporter walls that had been cracked open, floors 
ripped up, a bathroom torn inside out and the bedroom of one of the detained 
sons -- a 28-year-old plumber -- taken completely apart. Throughout the search, 
which the family said took 14 hours and spanned two days, the soldiers told 
them they were looking for an arms stockpile the family insisted did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli military spokesman confirmed that soldiers had conducted the 
search. The Abdul Majid house was targeted, he said, because the brothers were 
caught with bomb-making materials when they were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The army spokesman stressed that the search exhibited "the ongoing efforts by 
the Israel Defense Forces to locate and identify illegal weapons in the 
territories -- especially among those who are against the peace." But he 
confirmed that in the end, nothing was found at the Abdul Majid house. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinians do not blame Israel's security forces alone for the recent 
arms flow into the territories. Some leveled charges of negligence against the 
leaders of several Palestinian factions represented in Gaza, particularly 
Arafat's Fatah wing. That faction will supply most of the officers in the 
Palestinian police force planned for control of law and order in Gaza and 
Jericho as Israel withdraws. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Palestine Liberation Organization leaders confirm that it will be up to 
the new police to crack down on the weapons flow after the Israelis withdraw. 
But Shawa and other members of Arafat's handpicked team fear it may be too late 
by then. 
</P>
<P>
 Their fear goes beyond the potential for armed conflict between Fatah and an 
extremist opposition of fundamentalist Islamic groups and leftist political 
parties that also sponsor well-armed rebels in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the worry is grounded in ancient family feuds that have simmered 
beneath the surface of Gaza's society throughout the occupation. Israel's 
military presence, combined with a shared commitment among most Gazans to join 
forces against a more powerful common enemy, froze most of those feuds in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the memory is long in Gaza," Shawa said. "Maybe it was a woman, maybe a 
rape, maybe a piece of land. Maybe it happened 30 years ago, or maybe 300. But 
everyone here remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that guns are everywhere here, this could be a disaster. If the police 
fail to take immediate control -- a difficult task even in the best of times -- 
these feuds easily could explode the moment the common enemy is gone."

O.C. SEEKING $1 MILLION TO FIGHT FIRE FEARS 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County will ask the federal government for about $1 million more in 
disaster relief to help local residents, especially children, deal with 
lingering psychological trauma from the fall firestorms. 
</P>
<P>
 County Mental Health Director Timothy P. Mullins said hundreds of children 
whose families or friends lost homes in the devastating fires continue to have 
problems with concentration, nightmares and bed wetting. In addition, there is 
lingering trauma for others, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Some children, Mullins said, even react with signs of panic to the Santa Ana 
winds, which were blamed for whipping the October flames into a mobile inferno. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of requests for children," Mullins said. "We have some cases 
where children are sleeping with their mothers and fathers at age 13." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Orange County Board of Supervisors is expected to approve 
today a request for aid totaling $991,194. The county has already received 
about $400,000 in federal mental health aid related to fire damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, counselors who work for the county and local community 
health clinics would provide the counseling to adults and children. One program 
would be a stress-management session featuring clinical psychologist Robert 
Scott, who specializes in trauma/disaster psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 26-page grant application, county officials estimated that 400 children 
are considered at "high risk" of post-fire trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was noted that children are experiencing an increasing sense of 
vulnerability, anger, fear and anxiety over the fire losses," officials stated 
in the report. "Such children are increasingly seeking support elsewhere: in 
drug use and gang-like peer groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mullins said Laguna Beach and other South County communities have 
"experienced a good deal of healing" since the massive destruction last fall, 
the need for more help remains as Southern California shifts its attention from 
one disaster to another. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, some local resources and counselors once dedicated to 
firestorm survivors have been diverted to help victims of the recent Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 10 days, Mullins said about 30 county Mental Health Department 
workers have been dispatched to Los Angeles County to counsel those suffering 
from the immediate problems of home loss and extended homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the local counselors have been working in the "tent cities" where some 
residents have been living since the quake shook Los Angeles two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need up there is literally overwhelming," Mullins said. "Our people have 
been up there working 13- to 14-hour shifts." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Orange County, Mullins said that although children are among the most 
severely affected, other segments of the population are still experiencing 
post-fire troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Older adults, who make up about 14% of Laguna's population, "are still fearful 
that they will not be safe from arson," officials said in the county 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some still take their belongings with them wherever they go and many are 
reluctant to buy items of value," officials said. "Many older adults are 
isolated . . . and not inclined to seek services from unfamiliar programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of homes and other valuables for widowed older residents has been 
especially difficult as the lost items represent the only ties to a deceased 
spouse, Mullins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local homeless service providers also report an increasing number of contacts 
with the "chronically homeless" after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these individuals are those who camped in the canyon before the 
fire," officials said. "Others are emotionally handicapped individuals who, 
prior to the fire, were living with family or friends. The disruption of the 
fire has exacerbated their conditions and now makes a shared living arrangement 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 In their grant request, officials estimated that neighborhood and 
environmental restoration "will require years," especially in Laguna Beach, 
where hundreds of homes and thousands of acres of parklands were ravaged.

SEISMIC EXPERTS SEE COLLEGE BUILDINGS AS POTENTIAL DEATHTRAPS; QUAKES: 
OFFICIALS HAVE KNOWN OF HAZARDS SINCE 1979. FUNDING DIFFICULTIES AND A DESIRE 
TO AVOID DISRUPTIONS HAVE COMBINED TO DELAY CORRECTING THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 California's public universities are dotted with scores of classroom 
buildings, faculty offices and student hangouts that seismic experts warn could 
become deathtraps during major earthquakes like the one centered in the San 
Fernando Valley last month, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 State lawmakers and college officials have known about the earthquake hazards 
since at least 1979, when the state Seismic Safety Commission released a 
benchmark survey urging that 434 campus buildings be examined because they 
could pose significant risks to life. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has only been in recent years that the universities -- which are exempt 
from state and local earthquake standards -- have begun or stepped up 
construction programs aimed at shoring up walls, securing foundations and 
reinforcing the masonry skin on potentially unsafe structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the campus buildings in Southern California that have seismic hazards 
scheduled for retrofitting are UC Irvine's central plant and dance rehearsal 
addition, and Cal State Fullerton's library, bookstore/commons, humanities and 
social sciences, Langsdorf and physical education buildings and the health 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays in repairs have resulted from a combination of funding 
difficulties, the desire to avoid campus disruptions and a push to put up new 
buildings to keep up with growing enrollment, say university officials and 
their critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish they would go faster, I wish they were completed by now," said L. 
Thomas Tobin, the commission's executive director. "There's such a threat to 
life in these major buildings but the fact is that you can only do so many 
buildings at one time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20-campus California State University system -- with 327,000 students, 
the second-largest higher education system in the nation -- administrators have 
only recently compiled a list of 101 structures or "falling hazards" that need 
retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list are such heavily used areas as the John M. Pfau Library at 
Cal State San Bernardino; Humboldt State University's Jolly Giant dining 
commons, where all on-campus residence meals are served; the McIntosh 
humanities building and Fine Arts buildings at Cal State Long Beach and a 
library at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Also high on the list is Cal State Northridge's Sierra Tower, a seven-story 
complex of faculty offices and classrooms that sustained some of the school's 
heaviest damage during the Jan. 17 temblor. The structure, a mile from the 
epicenter, was to receive a $167,000 earthquake make-over this year, Cal State 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, University of California officials have identified 87 structures on 
their nine campuses yet to be fixed despite being considered poor or very poor 
seismic risks. These structures include landmarks on the two campuses with the 
highest seismic risks -- UCLA and Berkeley, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Royce Hall, the 1929 architectural symbol for the UCLA campus 
and the frequent backdrop for college scenes in movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA landmark, which had been scheduled for retrofitting in 1996, was 
closed for a week after the Northridge quake because its twin brick towers, 
weakened by cracks, threatened to fall. Portions of Royce Hall were reopened 
last week but only after crews built a special tunnel as an emergency exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators admit they are racing against the seismic clock but blame the 
Legislature for being slow to provide the hundreds of millions of dollars 
needed for wholesale retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects that get financed still face long delays because each phase -- 
planning, design, construction -- must go to Sacramento for budget approval. 
Even if the money were to suddenly materialize, university officials said, 
retrofitting is a logistical nightmare on a busy campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: The current retrofitting of UCLA's Powell Library. It took 
eight years to plan and required relocating 200,000 books to a specially 
constructed tent. And while the actual seismic work cost $11 million, other 
building and fire code upgrades for the 64-year-old building brought the price 
tag to $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be difficult to take all of the (older) buildings down at once and 
keep the campus functioning," said Cynthia Ingram, UCLA's assistant director 
for capital planning. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics and seismic experts say university officials have been part of the 
problem, largely ignoring -- and sometimes flouting -- the earthquake dangers 
on their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to attract more faculty, more students, more donors, it pays off 
to be opening handsome new buildings," said state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica). "The alternative is admitting that some buildings are dangerous to 
human life and that's really difficult to take responsibility for. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Faced with that, they cross their fingers and tap the table and hope the Big 
One doesn't hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes, campus administrators made matters worse, according to a 
November, 1990, Seismic Safety Commission report. In one glaring example, the 
agency scored UC Berkeley administrators for building weight rooms and coaching 
offices under Memorial Stadium, although they had been warned that the 
unreinforced 1920s structure straddles a fault that creeps noticeably each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report applauded UC for deciding to borrow $50 million on its own for 
retrofitting work after the Loma Prieta earthquake, but pointed out that 49 of 
the structures most in need of work were left off the repair list. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 report also reached the "unavoidable conclusion" that the Cal State 
system, where 1950s and 1960s concrete frame buildings pose serious earthquake 
hazards, had no retrofitting program at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The university system (is) not going to get to some of those buildings for 
10, 20 years," lamented Commissioner Lloyd S. Cluff at a commission hearing 
just before the report was released. "And so we're guaranteeing that the crisis 
is going to be created out of killing a lot of people on the campuses." 
</P>
<P>
 No one was killed or injured on university campuses in the Northridge quake, 
which struck at 4:31 a.m. of a day on which no classes were scheduled. A 
student was killed at Cal State Los Angeles when a concrete slab fell from a 
parking structure in the 1987 Whittier quake. Her family agreed to a 
$1.4-million settlement from the state and a construction company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seismic Safety Commission and Hayden sponsored a bill in the Legislature 
to require warning signs on all of the seismically vulnerable campus buildings. 
But UC lobbyists blocked the move, arguing that the warning signs would be 
disruptive and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding that bureaucratic resistance, say seismologists and structural 
engineers, was the fact that California's universities do not have to follow 
the state and local earthquake codes imposed on other public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The codes cover classrooms for kindergarten through community college students 
and require some load-bearing walls to be 15% stronger than normal. The act 
required public school districts to strengthen or raze all pre-1933 buildings 
by mid-1977 and mandated that all classroom designs and construction be 
supervised by the state architect's office as a double check. 
</P>
<P>
 As state entities, however, universities do not have to follow those rules. 
Had the same standards applied, said Dennis Bellet of the state architect's 
office, there would be no wondering about Royce Hall today. "That would have 
either been retrofitted or closed down by June 30, 1977," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, UCLA's immunity allowed administrators to use $13 million in private 
funds to renovate the historic structure before the 1984 Olympics without 
dedicating anything for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 A campus committee denounced the move when it warned in 1985 that Royce and 24 
other buildings could kill 2,000 people during a major quake along any of the 
three nearby faults. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA officials say they begged for state money to retrofit Royce but were 
turned down. Still, others say, they now look foolish not to have found a way 
to make the seismic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were the people who made the private donations, I'd be pretty upset 
because it just went down the toilet, didn't it?" said Bill Petak executive 
director of USC's Institute for Safety and Systems Management. "It's now a 
building with major problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Private colleges have had a better retrofitting record. The 1990 Seismic 
Safety Commission report made a strong point of showing how, in contrast to UC, 
Stanford officials diverted nearly all of their discretionary funds to upgrade 
their buildings after the Loma Prieta quake did major damage there. 
</P>
<P>
 As a private institution, USC spent $18 million to upgrade or demolish its 
older buildings after the city of Los Angeles passed a 1983 ordinance calling 
for the retrofitting of unreinforced masonry structures. USC architect Mark M. 
Jones said the school will have to spend "tens of millions" more if the city 
passes another ordinance requiring the upgrading of unreinforced masonry "fill" 
buildings with concrete frames. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, said Tobin of the state's seismic commission, Cal State 
administrators have been showing increased concern. They have hired the state 
architect's office to help monitor construction and have compiled the list of 
101 future retrofitting projects.

BROWN LEADS CAMPAIGN RACE FOR CASH; POLITICS: WITH $5.2 MILLION IN HER COFFERS, 
DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE EASILY OUTPACES WILSON AND GARAMENDI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the campaign for governor begins, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown has twice 
as much political money on hand as fellow Democrat John Garamendi and 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson combined, according to reports filed Monday with 
the secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown reported ending 1993 with $5.2 million in her campaign war chest, enough 
to pay for at least five weeks of television commercials in every major 
metropolitan area of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner and a former legislator, had just 
over $1 million on hand for his underdog battle to wrest the Democratic 
nomination from Brown, who has long been favored in opinion polls and among 
political insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson reported having $1.2 million in his campaign bank account as he geared 
up to run for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's huge cash reserve apparently makes her the best-funded candidate ever 
at the beginning of a California governor's race. At this time four years ago, 
Wilson, then a U.S. senator, had $4.6 million on hand and eventually spent $24 
million to defeat Democrat Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's money gives her "phenomenal momentum" entering the primary campaign, 
said Michael Reese, her campaign spokesman. He said she raised $5.7 million in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The foundation is firmly in place," Reese said. "The structure has begun to 
be built upon it. It's got to be a daunting indication of support for those who 
would challenge her." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's campaign manager, Darry Sragow, said his candidate met a personal 
goal of having $1 million on hand by the end of 1993. Garamendi raised $1.2 
million in 1993 through his gubernatorial committee and transferred another 
$480,000 from the committee he formed as insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we needed to have $1 million in the bank to avoid conclusions that we 
just weren't viable," Sragow said. "That was the threshold we felt we had to 
meet for insiders not to write us off altogether. That's where we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow said he believes it will take about $5 million for Garamendi to mount a 
credible campaign for the nomination. He said Garamendi's campaign has lower 
overhead than Brown's and will be able to operate with less money. 
</P>
<P>
 "John has assured me that we will have the money we need to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's representatives downplayed the governor's relatively paltry campaign 
kitty, noting that Wilson has spent much of the past three years raising money 
for efforts not directly tied to his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, for example, spent about $1.5 million to underwrite the Republican 
effort to influence the drawing of new legislative and congressional districts 
in 1991. He also raised money for his failed Proposition 165, which would have 
slashed welfare payments and increased the governor's fiscal powers, and for 
Proposition 172, which extended a temporary half-cent sales tax and gave the 
money it raised to local government. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown was "hoarding cash" in an attempt to frighten Garamendi out of the 
race, "Pete Wilson was working tirelessly on behalf of candidates and causes he 
believes in," said George Gorton, Wilson's campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's two committees reported raising $5.9 million in 1993. Gorton said he 
expected the campaign to raise between $20 million and $25 million by the time 
the general election is held in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The voluminous campaign reports were mailed Monday to the secretary of state 
and were not available for inspection. Each campaign supplied The Times with 
the summary sheets that show only the total amounts the candidates raised, 
spent and kept in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Wilson and Brown campaigns sought to highlight what they said was the 
broad-based nature of their fund-raising efforts, though the reports will 
almost certainly show that most of the money they raised came from individuals, 
business and labor groups with a stake in state policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton said Wilson's average contribution was $143. Brown's spokesman said her 
average contribution was $210, and 11,207 of her 16,934 contributions were for 
amounts less than $100. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garamendi's campaign took a different tack, claiming that the candidate's 
receipt of several large loans showed confidence in the insurance 
commissioner's chances of winning the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow said Garamendi received loans of $200,000 from Claremont lawyer and 
investor Herb Hafif, $100,000 from Dame Construction Co. of San Ramon, and 
$50,000 each from Palo Alto investor George Marcus, Los Angeles developer 
Robert Abernethy, and Guess? Inc., the clothing manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people aren't doing this for fun," Sragow said. "These are 
sophisticated business people and investors who assess risk very carefully. 
They obviously feel John's chances of winning are excellent." Cost of Running 
for Governor 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign has scarcely begun, yet the three major candidates for governor 
already have raised more than $14 million. The totals shown include money 
raised in 1993 by the candidates' gubernatorial committees as well as money 
transferred into those accounts from committees the candidates established to 
raise money for other offices or purposes. 03,21,15,15 Total Raised *Cash on 
Hand *Kathleen Brown (D) $6.96 million $5.20 million *John Garamendi (D) $1.69 
million $1.05 million *Pete Wilson (R) $5.91 million $1.23 million *As of Dec. 
31, 1993

and require some load-bearing walls to be 15% stronger than normal. The act 
required public school districts to strengthen or raze all pre-1933 buildings 
by mid-1977 and mandated that all classroom designs and construction be 
supervised by the state architect's office as a double check. 
</P>
<P>
 As state entities, however, universities do not have to follow those rules. 
Had the same standards applied, said Dennis Bellet of the state architect's 
office, there would be no wondering about Royce Hall today. "That would have 
either been retrofitted or closed down by June 30, 1977," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, UCLA's immunity allowed administrators to use $13 million in private 
funds to renovate the historic structure before the 1984 Olympics without 
dedicating anything for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 A campus committee denounced the move when it warned in 1985 that Royce and 24 
other buildings could kill 2,000 people during a major quake along any of the 
three nearby faults. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA officials say they begged for state money to retrofit Royce but were 
turned down. Still, others say, they now look foolish not to have found a way 
to make the seismic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were the people who made the private donations, I'd be pretty upset 
because it just went down the toilet, didn't it?" said Bill Petak executive 
director of USC's Institute for Safety and Systems Management. "It's now a 
building with major problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Private colleges have had a better retrofitting record. The 1990 Seismic 
Safety Commission report made a strong point of showing how, in contrast to UC, 
Stanford officials diverted nearly all of their discretionary funds to upgrade 
their buildings after the Loma Prieta quake did major damage there. 
</P>
<P>
 As a private institution, USC spent $18 million to upgrade or demolish its 
older buildings after the city of Los Angeles passed a 1983 ordinance calling 
for the retrofitting of unreinforced masonry structures. USC architect Mark M. 
Jones said the school will have to spend "tens of millions" more if the city 
passes another ordinance requiring the upgrading of unreinforced masonry "fill" 
buildings with concrete frames. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, said Tobin of the state's seismic commission, Cal State 
administrators have been showing increased concern. They have hired the state 
architect's office to help monitor construction and have compiled the list of 
101 future retrofitting projects. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said UC officials have stepped up their efforts to fix earthquake 
hazards by 2000. 
</P>

<P>
 Following is a partial list of buildings on UC and Cal State campuses in 
Southern California that have seismic hazards that are scheduled for 
retrofitting. Only UC buildings considered "very poor" seismic risks are 
included. Buildings marked with an asterisk were damaged in the Jan. 17

DEUKMEJIAN TO REPRESENT INSURER BEFORE HIGH COURT; LAW: EX-GOVERNOR APPOINTED 
FIVE OF SEVEN JUSTICES WHO WILL HEAR THE CASE. HE IS ARGUING TO HAVE A FORMER 
BACKER'S SURETY FIRM EXEMPTED FROM PROP. 103 RATE ROLLBACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former Gov. George Deukmejian, now a lawyer in private practice, has signed on 
to represent an insurance company owned by his onetime leading campaign 
contributor in a case pending before the California Supreme Court, five of 
whose seven members he appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer, Northridge-based Surety Co. of the Pacific, is fighting, along 
with the rest of the industry, to get the Supreme Court to uphold a 1990 law -- 
which Deukmejian signed -- that exempts surety companies from the rate 
rollbacks required by Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield said Deukmejian's involvement is "a 
threat to the integrity of the judicial branch." He asserted that this instance 
would be the first time a former governor represented a law client before the 
California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how the court can properly face a guy who's been either a law 
partner, an employer or a benefactor of five of them," Rosenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deukmejian appointed Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justices Edward A. 
Panelli, Joyce L. Kennard, Armand Arabian and Marvin R. Baxter. Lucas is a 
former law partner of Deukmejian and Baxter a former aide. The other two 
justices, Stanley Mosk and Ronald M. George, were appointed by Gov. Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown Sr. and Gov. Pete Wilson, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Deukmejian did not return telephone calls for comment at his law office with 
the Los Angeles firm of Sidley & Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether Deukmejian will argue the case in person, but he wrote a 
four-page letter to the court dated Jan. 19 in which he outlined the reasons 
why he thought the high court should hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, in the case of Amwest Surety Insurance Co. vs. Pete Wilson et al, 
the 2nd District Court of Appeal struck down the 1990 law in a 2-1 decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Surety Co. of the Pacific is involved in the case only as a friend of the 
court, supporting Amwest, but it has a strong financial interest in the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Surety companies provide completion bonds and other kinds of performance 
guarantees for construction projects, movies and other ventures. It has been 
estimated that the surety industry as a whole will be liable for price rebates 
of as much as $100 million if it is ultimately found to be subject to 
Proposition 103, the 1988 insurance rollback initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Surety's owner and president, William Erwin, was the leading contributor to 
Deukmejian's 1982 campaign for governor, giving $203,000. From 1978 through 
1989, Surety Co. contributed $243,457 to Deukmejian-controlled campaign 
committees, according to the Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Erwin hung up on a reporter seeking comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, in a statement Monday evening, avoided 
criticizing Deukmejian directly, but said he had faith in the Supreme Court 
justices "being professionals who can and will ignore the high-powered 
political pressure of the insurance companies and will instead decide the case 
on its merits."

TOUGHER CONCEALED GUN PROPOSAL DEFEATED; LEGISLATION: ASSEMBLY REJECTS A PLAN 
TO TRIPLE THE MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR VIOLATORS. NRA OPPOSED THE BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Assembly on Monday defeated legislation supported by law enforcement and 
opposed by the National Rifle Assn. that would increase the maximum penalty for 
illegally carrying a concealed gun from one year to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision of the two powerful interests marked the first test of power in 
an election year legislative session in which crime and public safety are 
expected to be dominant themes. 
</P>
<P>
 After an emotional debate, 34 members -- all Democrats -- voted for the bill; 
40 Republicans and Democrats voted against it. Passage required 41 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would have empowered district attorneys to file either misdemeanor or 
felony charges against people arrested for illegally concealing a firearm in 
their clothing or automobiles. Now, illegal possession of a concealed gun is a 
misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. Making it a felony would have 
increased the maximum penalty to three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was a victory for the NRA, which has sought a political comeback 
after losing the bitterly fought battle over the ban on assault guns in the 
1989 legislative session. The NRA long has fought for the right of citizens to 
arm themselves for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and California chiefs of police and 
sheriffs, defeat of the measure -- authored by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) -- constituted a setback in efforts to get a firmer grip on the 
illegal use of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz forecast that other crime-fighting initiatives restricting the use of 
guns may face a similar fate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this shows is that the NRA (and other gun owner organizations) have 
people so afraid that they can't even vote for a law enforcement bill. That's 
pathetic," an angry Katz told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't pass a bill that gives prosecutors an opportunity (to file felony 
charges), I don't know how they're going to pass anything else," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans argued that instead of making otherwise law-abiding citizens 
potentially subject to a felony, the Legislature should make it easier for them 
to legally pack pistols and revolvers in their clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gun ownership is the best protection from crime," said Assemblyman Trice 
Harvey (R-Bakersfield). 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also asserted that in an era when law enforcement cannot assure 
citizens of protection against criminals, Californians should be granted 
greater access to concealed weapons permits to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of all the taxes that you pay, your government cannot protect you," 
said Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia), who opposed the bill. "Now we want 
to say, 'You can't protect yourself either.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the bill contended that stiffer penalties would discourage 
people who otherwise might carry concealed weapons illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz charged that the NRA had wrongly turned the debate into a gun control 
issue. "This bill doesn't deprive anyone from buying a gun or from 
self-protection," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun permits are issued by police chiefs and sheriffs based on individual 
assessments of the applicant's background and need. 
</P>
<P>
 Rural sheriffs issue more permits than their counterparts in big cities. In 
1992, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 427 
permit holders in Los Angeles County. In sparsely populated Shasta County, 
2,917 residents were licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the state Department of Justice reported that there were 33,345 
Californians licensed to carry concealed weapons in 1992. A decade earlier, 
43,718 were licensed.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; OJAI AND THE BLACK ORB; THE LATEST BATTLE INVOLVES A NATIONAL 
WEATHER SERVICE TOWER. LIKE IT OR NOT, CITIZEN ACTIVISTS HAVE BECOME A 
POLITICAL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 This is a well-read, well-educated hamlet that does not easily take no for an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Its residents are more likely to vote than those elsewhere in Ventura County, 
they mobilize quickly and they do not take to those they consider a threat to 
the quality of life in the verdant Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Ojai activists have derailed a would-be landfill, squelched a 
petroleum plant expansion, felled a university site, muscled into a private 
golf resort's development plans and filed numerous lawsuits to protect their 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not -- and many clearly do not -- citizen activists in the Ojai 
Valley have become a political force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very, very bright people," said attorney Mitchel B. Kahn, who 
represented the waste management firm that last year lost a bid to open a 
landfill in a nearby canyon. "Together, they make quite a formidable group." 
</P>
<P>
 A higher percentage of Ojai residents hold college degrees and library cards 
than in Ventura County as a whole. But some say that the location beneath the 
TopaTopa Mountains contributes to the town's individualism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's geographical," said Greg Helms of the Environmental Defense Center, a 
Santa Barbara legal advocacy firm that handles lawsuits for several groups in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you live in the Ojai Valley, you're together in a kind of village," he 
said. "It's a sort of an Old America feeling about the community that lends 
itself to public participation." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at USA Petroleum do not like to talk about Ojai's activism. They are 
apparently still smarting from a citizens panel that 10 years ago thwarted a 
planned $100-million expansion at the firm's Petrochem refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 96 acres have been up for sale ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest political battle cry was sounded after the National Weather Service 
began erecting a 98-foot radar tower atop Sulphur Peak in the upper Ojai 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The tower will greatly enhance their ability to monitor thunderstorms, wind 
currents and other atmospheric conditions, weather service officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Information gleaned from the new system -- designed to replace an aging tower 
in Los Angeles -- will be shared with federal air traffic controllers and 
military brass to help track flight paths and plan strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is urgent that the Sulphur Mountain radar become operational as soon as 
possible," said Thomas Potter, regional director of the weather service. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one told those who live along the pricey ridge that the so-called 
"black orb" was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Upper Ojai residents awoke one crisp morning in early December in the shadow 
of what looked to them like a huge black ball nesting above a thick steel 
scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days they stood in front of a Ventura County Superior Court judge 
arguing for, and receiving, a temporary restraining order prohibiting 
completion of the weather-tracking project. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks since, the government has condemned a portion of a driveway that 
leads to the site, threatened to arrest protesters and unleashed federal 
lawyers to ensure that the project is not delayed further. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, a federal judge sided with the government and refused to issue a 
restraining order blocking construction of the project. Another hearing is set 
for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the radar tower point to research that possibly links higher 
instances of cancer, birth defects, leukemia and other maladies to the kind of 
low-level radiation emitted from the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a highly educated community," said David Hedman, an upper Ojai 
resident who fought the Weldon Canyon dump and is one of the plaintiffs in the 
weather station lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear those fighting the radar and other ecological-legal battles tell it, 
the Ojai Valley is one of the last resting places of popular rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina V. Shelley, an Ojai councilwoman who served a stint in the Marine Corps, 
calls the activist sentiment a mix of Old West tenacity and sheer grit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I operate with when I'm speaking for the community," she said. 
"Don't let go. Don't even consider failing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranch owner Kim Bonsall knows that community doggedness from personal 
experience. She ran headlong into it last year when the Bonsall family was 
about to allow a landfill on part of its 6,500-acre spread in Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire how quickly they got organized," Bonsall said. "But I don't admire 
what they said once they got organized. For any project that goes on, 
(activists) are very quick to say something negative before having all the 
facts in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonsall is not alone. Many private attorneys and local officials have been 
forced to answer to Ojai-based environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do keep me on my toes, no doubt about that," said Richard H. Baldwin, 
director of the county Air Pollution Control District. "They confront us by 
meetings, letters, what have you. Elsewhere in the county, that's not 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 But confrontation can also be an asset, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the business view I hear constantly, but we don't hear the citizen's 
view very often," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 However, lawyers for the firm planning to build a private golf resort on a 
sprawling hillside above the nearby community of Meiners Oaks still hold a 
grudge against the citizen activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some genuinely concerned people up there, but some of the activists 
would have us all living in tepees again," said Lindsay F. Nielson, who 
represents Farmont Corp., which wants to build the golf course. "They simply 
believe that any form of development is evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielson, a board member of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., called many of 
the activist efforts misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai does have a large number of people who are very environmentally in 
tune," he said. "But they aren't interested in what impact (a project) has on 
the economy of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a proposed university campus did not escape the purview of the ecological 
watchdogs. As soon as officials targeted Taylor Ranch, near California 33 and 
U.S. 101, for a state university, opponents concerned about air quality in the 
Ojai Valley went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were planning for 20,000 students," said Pat Baggerly, a Meiners Oaks 
resident and member of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County that 
opposed the site. "And all that (smog) blows up this way." 
</P>
<P>
 The campus is now being planned for a lemon grove outside Camarillo.

WASHINGTON BACKS U.N. PLAN FOR BOSNIA AIR SUPPORT; BALKANS: SECRETARY OF STATE 
CHRISTOPHER'S DECLARATION DRAWS U.S. A STEP CLOSER TO COMBAT OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States supports a proposal by U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali to use U.S. and allied air power to help open an airport in 
Bosnia for aid flights and to relieve a beleaguered Canadian peacekeeping unit, 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By offering seemingly unqualified backing for Boutros-Ghali's plan, 
Christopher drew the United States a step closer to combat operations in the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general said last Friday that he was ready to call for allied 
air strikes to punish Serbian guerrillas if they interfere with U.N. efforts to 
rotate the garrison at Srebrenica or to reopen the airport at Tuzla. Both towns 
are crowded with desperate Muslim refugees who have fled fighting elsewhere in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've endorsed that report," Christopher told reporters. "That could lead to 
the use of air power if there's not an agreement for the replacement of the 
Canadian troops at Srebrenica or for the opening of the airport at Tuzla." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl discussed the Bosnia 
conflict Monday during a 1 1/2-hour working lunch at an Italian restaurant in 
Washington's Georgetown neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials discouraged speculation that the discussion -- or talks 
scheduled for later this week with British and European Union leaders -- was 
aimed at forging a new policy to counter French efforts to pressure the 
Muslim-led Bosnian government into accepting a peace settlement that would 
ratify territorial gains registered by Serbian and Croatian militias during the 
bloody ethnic war. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Christopher and other State Department officials have made no 
secret of their distaste for the French approach of applying pressure on the 
Bosnian government, which Washington considers to be the victim of Serbian and 
Croatian aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Before meeting with Clinton, in an address to the National Governors' Assn. in 
Washington, Kohl urged the United States to continue its leadership role in 
world affairs and said that there is a need for a strong European defense 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evil spirits of nationalism are not only at large in the Balkans," Kohl 
said. The "unfortunate signs that war has not yet been banished" make creation 
of a European security policy "more important than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Kohl indicated he would support U.N. efforts to stop the flow of 
Croatian troops across the border into Bosnia. At a news conference, Kohl said 
he could not confirm that such movements were taking place. But if they were, 
he said, he would disapprove "very severely and find a way to (put) my 
disapproval into practice." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Kohl repeated his nation's opposition to sending outside 
ground troops into the conflict. That would create "an incredible blood bath," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali's plan for Srebrenica and Tuzla is a complex combination of 
diplomacy and force. It is designed to permit relief flights to the isolated 
Tuzla enclave and to replace the Canadian unit in Srebrenica with a larger 
Dutch contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 Both towns were designated by the United Nations as "safe areas" for Muslim 
refugees but are targets of steady Serbian bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Boutros-Ghali's proposal, the United Nations would negotiate with the 
Serbs in an effort to obtain their agreement on a cease-fire to permit the 
relief of Tuzla and Srebrenica without opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Serbs agree, U.N. forces would carry out the operations, backed by NATO 
air power, which would be ready to strike in case the Serbs go back on their 
promise. Even if the Serbs do not agree to a cease-fire, Boutros-Ghali said, 
the United Nations might attempt the operations anyway, protected by allied air 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the Clinton Administration agrees 
with Boutros-Ghali that the United States and its allies have the authority to 
provide close air support for U.N. troops without further authorization by 
either the Security Council or NATO's North Atlantic Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But, McCurry said, air cover for Srebrenica and Tuzla may take some time to 
organize.

BOSNIAN SERBS MOBILIZED FOR PUSH ON BESIEGED MUSLIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb commanders Monday ordered mobilization of all able-bodied adults 
in their territory for a final push to defeat the Muslim-led government after 
22 months of siege. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel military chieftains paired the call-up with threats of harsh punishment 
for deserters and anyone who fails to report to military training centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The high command also announced a crackdown on illegal trade, especially with 
enemy forces, reported the Serb-run Tanjug news agency in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-scale mobilization intensified fears of a major offensive against 
this Bosnian capital or the northern city of Tuzla, which the United Nations 
wants to use as a port for humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But the highly publicized directive for all men and women to report to the 
nearest army garrison may be an attempt to intimidate NATO and U.N. forces that 
have threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serb units undermining U.N. 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Military leaders of the self-styled Serbian Republic that covers 70% of Bosnia 
are mustering all available forces "to successfully end the war," Tanjug said 
of the measures. The report claimed the call-up was necessary because "the 
international community has decided to support the Muslims in the war option." 
</P>
<P>
 The mustering appeared to be in reaction to U.N. approval of close North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization air support for operations aimed at opening Tuzla 
airport for humanitarian relief flights and breaking a Serbian blockade of 
Canadian troops guarding the besieged Muslim enclave of Srebrenica. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bosnian Serbs have a huge advantage in weaponry, having inherited 
hundreds of tanks, artillery pieces and aircraft from the Yugoslav People's 
Army, which withdrew from Bosnia in May, 1992, they have fewer fighters and 
flagging morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory appeared at hand last fall when Western mediators at peace talks in 
Geneva accepted what was largely a Serbian plan for carving Bosnia into three 
ethnic ministates. The Serbian province would have covered more than half of 
the once-integrated republic and would eventually have been allowed to secede 
and join fellow Serbs in rump Yugoslavia, gaining international acceptance of 
the state they expanded by force. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Muslim-led government rejected partitioning and has indicated in 
subsequent negotiation sessions that it is prepared to fight on to defend what 
is left of Bosnia rather than accede to an unjust peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Demoralized by the protracted conflict and dwindling prospects for a 
negotiated settlement, the Bosnian Serb rebels have lately endured battlefield 
stalemates and even some losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Irregular troops loyal to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his rogue 
republic are believed to number about 80,000. But the rising number of young, 
male Bosnian Serb refugees in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade suggests growing 
disenchantment with a rebellion that has so far brought only poverty, isolation 
and international scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees complained last week 
that Bosnian Serb refugees were being rounded up in Belgrade and pressed into 
service for the fight in Bosnia, a violation of international covenants that 
aim to protect refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Disgruntled rebel gunmen have increasingly been selling weapons and ammunition 
to earn money for basic necessities or to bribe their way out of the country, 
and much of the black-market weaponry is ending up in the hands of their 
enemies.

4 KILLED AFTER RUNNING CHECKPOINT

<P>
 Bosnian military police opened fire as a stolen aid vehicle sped through a 
checkpoint near Sarajevo on Monday, state TV said. Three gunmen and a hostage 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle was stolen Thursday from a British aid worker who was then slain, 
prompting Britain to halt aid shipments to Bosnia-Herzegovina for a few days 
and U.N. officials to say they would reassess their relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government investigators said Sunday that they had recovered a car the 
killers used and had suspects in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the driver of the car stolen from the British aid worker did not 
stop at a military police checkpoint and passengers opened fire with automatic 
weapons, state TV said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian soldiers killed the three gunmen and one civilian hostage riding in 
the car, the report said.

TURNABOUT: WHITE HOUSE STAFF TURNS CRITIC; TELEVISION COVERAGE IS SOMETHING OF 
A 'JOKE,' ONE SENIOR STAFFER SAYS. AS FOR NEWSPAPERS, THE FARTHER FROM THE 
CAPITAL THE BETTER, SURVEY FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind closed doors and away from the heat of the klieg lights, the senior 
officials around Bill Clinton admit they don't think much of the media who 
cover them. 
</P>
<P>
 They think television coverage of the presidency, as one adviser put it, is 
something of a "joke." Most prefer the coverage in out-of-town papers to that 
provided by the New York Times and Washington Post. And many believe that much 
of the press seems eager to destroy people and policies rather than provide 
objective coverage of either. The views are contained in an in-house survey of 
key top advisers conducted by members of the White House staff and obtained by 
the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-page report, assembled for the White House "Bulletin" newsletter, did 
not specify how many people were interviewed, only that it was "a sizable 
portion of the President's top advisers" and their deputies who work with the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, the media receive a passing grade for accuracy," the report said. 
But it went on to characterize that accuracy as "inconsistent . . . spotty" and 
said that the term "accuracy" applies at all only when the press is reporting 
basic facts. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the task that the modern media increasingly see as its more 
important role -- providing context and analysis -- insiders view the press as 
far less capable. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as they try to explain what (something) meant, or what we were trying 
to accomplish, they fall into the quicksand called 'Washington journalism,' " 
one official was quoted as saying. All of the quotations in the report are 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the findings of a survey conducted by the George Bush White 
House in early 1992, Clinton's advisers do not detect any ideological bias in 
the press. Most often, the media were described as "apolitical" and "middle of 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at least one senior official said that perception itself suggests "we 
share a similar outlook. . . . When you agree with people, you generally call 
them moderate, middle of the road or apolitical." 
</P>
<P>
 And one aide thought the press reflected the values of "the elite . . . the 
views, feelings, conventions of people who earn two, three and four times the 
median income." 
</P>
<P>
 "That works to our advantage on stories like NAFTA," the official said, 
referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, "and it clearly redounded 
to the President's disadvantage when he was raising taxes on the wealthiest 2% 
of Americans. . . . It came across in the reportage as if he was raising taxes 
across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 But most advisers see negativism, pack mentality and a fascination with 
"inside baseball" as the media's dominant fixations. 
</P>
<P>
 "All respondents" expressed "dismay over how those in the press exhibit 
limited creativity and seldom stray from the group conclusion" on what is the 
story of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general approach seems to be to figure out the issue . . . on which the 
White House appears to be most vulnerable and to make that the story," one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, that story is dictated by the New York Times, the Washington Post or 
the Wall Street Journal, and "many reporters -- particularly those at the 
Washington Post and New York Times -- are preoccupied with the power struggles 
on the inside, often at the expense of good reporting on the substance," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an eagerness in the press to pull down policies and people," the 
report added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been struck by the persistent efforts on the part of the press to try 
to get members of the White House staff to leak against each other," one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the senior staff tended to prefer newspapers based outside of 
Washington and farther removed from the political swirl: the Wall Street 
Journal, Knight Ridder newspapers and the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Television, however, was held nearly in contempt. "Television is a joke, and 
it is scary to think that this is the way many Americans get their news," one 
official said. "They always put some weird hype on the story that makes 
everybody around here shake their heads or, at times, laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 "They have great power but seem to spend more time trying to put together 
catchy phrases than they do working the White House," another official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most sensitive issue is the ranking of reporters. And the results 
may reflect more than the journalists' work. They may be colored by how White 
House staffers feel about a reporter on a personal basis or about a particular 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Being the favorite of an Administration may be a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a bit of a surprise, Brit Hume of ABC received the most favorable mentions 
as the best network correspondent," the report said. Hume is an outspoken 
conservative and is "credited by those in the White House press room as being 
the most difficult to work with. But senior officials say his reporting is the 
most accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bush White House, Hume tied as best with CNN's Charles Bierbauer. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's Andrea Mitchell was second in the survey. "As for the worst 
correspondent, CBS's Rita Braver edged out CNN's Jill Dougherty," but Braver is 
new to the beat and "again, quite a few names were mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
 For networks, ABC was first, NBC second, CNN ("the choice of the Bush White 
House"), dropping to third and CBS "the worst network . . . for two years in a 
row." 
</P>
<P>
 In print, "the Wall Street Journal's Jeff Birnbaum and the Los Angeles Times' 
David Lauter ran a statistical heat for the best newspaper reporters," in the 
minds of the senior staff. "Lauter, who was criticized by Bush officials during 
the '92 campaign for being pro-Clinton, was given high marks for the quality of 
his sources." Tom Friedman of the New York Times finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 For the worst newspaper reporter, "there were almost as many answers as there 
were respondents," though "the New York Posts' Deborah Orrin leads the pack." 
</P>
<P>
 The most mentioned reporter of the Bush years, as both best and worst, Ann 
Devroy of the Washington Post, gathered only two votes as best and only one as 
worst. "Devroy will emerge in time," one official is quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Among columnists, senior aides most often preferred E. J. Dionne of the 
Washington Post and William Safire of the New York Times. Votes for the worst 
columnists were too split to name a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Among newsweeklies, Time finished first, and its reporter Michael Duffy was 
named the best newsweekly reporter. Newsweek finished second, and U.S. News & 
World Report "trailed a distant third." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the worst newsweekly reporter, the field again was quite large, with 
two Newsweek reporters barely "winning:" Bob Cohn and Howard Fineman.

LIKELY ISRAEL-PLO PACT ASKS BOTH SIDES TO GIVE GROUND; MIDEAST: TENTATIVE 
ACCORD REACHED IN SWISS TALKS EVEN DETAILS BORDER-STATION WINDOW GLASS, SOURCES 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As details emerged here of tentative accords reached early Monday between 
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on the future of Jericho and 
the Gaza Strip, it was clear that both sides would have to give significant 
ground on issues ranging from the security of Jewish settlers to control of 
international frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the proposed agreements, reached by Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in Switzerland, are so detailed 
they specify the type of window glass that will be used at border stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who spent most of the day consumed with 
a crisis developing in his government over national health insurance, made no 
public comment on the proposals, which were faxed to him from Switzerland on 
Monday. He was reported to be studying the intricate set of compromises, and 
there were sharply conflicting reports in the Israeli media on the prospects 
for a final agreement that would pave the way for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the day, Israel Radio, which reported details of the tentative 
agreements for the first time, announced, "The indications from the prime 
minister's bureau are that, by and large, Rabin endorses these agreements." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Television, though, took the opposite tone in its evening broadcast. 
It quoted sources close to the prime minister saying unofficially, "Whatever 
progress was made (between Peres and Arafat) was certainly not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring that skepticism, Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, who joined 
Peres during the weekend talks, told Israeli Television on arrival from 
Switzerland, "There is still a long, long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not close to a full agreement. But certain issues have been almost 
finalized." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Arafat, also confirmed to Israeli Television: "There 
is no agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Tibi said, "It's true that on the first day there 
was a very positive atmosphere. Certain understandings were reached. Later, 
Israel went back on some of the things that were agreed upon." Asked to 
identify the most important outstanding dispute, he said it was the border 
crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements came against a backdrop of general optimism here that a final 
round of negotiations scheduled for later this week in Cairo would clear the 
last remaining obstacles to the start of Palestinian self-rule, and that Peres 
and Arafat could sign an official agreement as early as Sunday, when both said 
they are planning to meet again in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres was decidedly upbeat as he left Switzerland before dawn Monday for 
Washington, where he is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and Vice President Al Gore. He indicated that he and Arafat 
had settled most of the disputes that have delayed Israel's original commitment 
to begin withdrawing its troops from the occupied territories Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been very complicated problems," Peres said. "We were able to 
negotiate many of them, maybe most of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Official reports detailing the agreements stated that Peres' delegation had 
ceded to PLO demands for what the Palestinians called "safe passages" -- land 
routes entirely under Palestinian authority that would permit Palestinians and 
other religious pilgrims to pass from Jericho to holy sites outside the 
autonomous zone of Jericho. Among those sites is Nabi Moussa, a shrine near the 
Dead Sea that Muslims have revered for centuries as the tomb of Moses. 
</P>
<P>
 But "on control of the border points, Israel got most of what it wanted," 
state radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
 According to several accounts on state radio, in Israel's Hebrew press and 
confirmed by Minister Sarid, Arafat agreed to Israeli proposals to set up a 
complex system of surveillance at the border crossings between Egypt and the 
Gaza Strip, and at the Allenby Bridge between Jericho and Jordan. Specifically, 
the PLO said it would permit Israeli state security to observe every individual 
and each item entering the autonomous region from behind two-way mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's delegation further agreed, according to those reports, to Israeli 
demands for what state radio called "a sterile room" at the border posts, where 
Israeli security officers will be permitted to interrogate and search 
"suspicious" persons without Palestinian officials present. 
</P>
<P>
 The border crossings have been among the most contentious of the outstanding 
issues between Israel and the PLO, and Sarid confirmed Monday night that the 
two sides are now "very, very close to full agreement" on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Palestinians, control of their own borders is both a symbolic and 
logistic assertion of sovereignty after 27 years under Israeli occupation. For 
Israel, though, the issue is one of security and the ability to police against 
the influx of arms or illegal immigrants entering an autonomous land in its 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Most accounts in Israel's highly regarded Hebrew media stated that the weekend 
talks resolved all major outstanding disputes between the two sides and 
included a Palestinian agreement to permit Israeli security to control key 
roads in the Gaza Strip. Israel had insisted on the patrols as a way to ensure 
the safety of the 5,000 Jewish settlers who will remain in Gaza until the fate 
of Jewish settlements throughout the territories is decided in future 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained unclear, though, whether Peres and Arafat resolved a final 
disagreement over the size of Jericho. Most of Israel's major daily newspapers 
reported that the two had reached "a gentlemen's agreement" under which Peres 
agreed to recommend that the prime minister offer a larger territory than his 
negotiators have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But state radio disputed the reports, announcing, "The remaining bone of 
contention appears to be the extent of withdrawal of the Israeli army in the 
Jericho area."

GUATEMALAN VOTERS OK ANTI-CORRUPTION AMENDMENTS

<P>
 Guatemalans voted out the Congress and Supreme Court in an anti-corruption 
referendum that drew fewer than one in five voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the referendum called by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said the 
low turnout showed the public did not support the proposed constitutional 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon called the turnout "unfortunate" but said the vote was nonetheless a 
defeat for the "enemies of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 De Leon, a former human rights lawyer, was named president by Congress last 
June after an attempt by former President Jorge Serrano to grab total power 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the new president is sincere in wanting to purge corrupt officials 
but that the referendum is really a farce in that many members of Congress 
might simply be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 16% of the country's 3.44 million eligible voters cast ballots in 
the referendum Sunday, according to an electoral official. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who voted, 370,044, or 83%, approved the 43 constitutional changes 
and the dismissal of Congress and the Supreme Court, the official said.

DRUG PRICE RISE MAY ADD PRESSURE FOR CONTROLS; HEALTH: COSTS SOAR FASTER THAN 
GENERAL INFLATION RATE. PRESIDENT INDICATES HE MAY COMPROMISE ON REGIONAL 
ALLIANCES, SPENDING CAPS. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite efforts by many leading pharmaceutical companies to moderate their 
price increases last year, wholesale drug prices rose 15.5 times faster than 
the general inflation rate at the manufacturing level in 1993, according to a 
Senate report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, which were disputed by the drug industry, are expected to 
increase pressure for government controls on drug prices. The development came 
as President Clinton reportedly signaled a willingness to compromise on two key 
elements of his health care reform plan: regional health alliances and overall 
spending caps. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, prices charged by drug manufacturers rose 3.1% -- the lowest increase 
in nearly three decades. The moderation has been attributed to voluntary 
efforts by the pharmaceutical companies to keep increases within the general 
rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the newly released analysis of drug pricing by the Senate Select Committee 
on Aging noted that, even though drug price inflation has cooled, the overall 
increase still was 15.5 times the inflation rate of 0.2% for all manufacturing 
prices in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The report cited a 21.3% price increase for Lozol, a diuretic manufactured by 
Rorer; 13.2% on Zovirax, a herpes drug by Burroughs; 12.4% on Lorcet Plus, a 
painkiller by UAD Labs; 12.4% on Thyrolar-1, a thyroid replacement by Forest, 
and 12% on Lortab, a painkiller by Whitby. 
</P>
<P>
 It identified UAD Labs, Rhone Poulenc, Alcon and Boots as the companies with 
the highest increases in the industry during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), chairman of the committee, said the report 
demonstrates a need for stricter government controls on the pharmaceutical 
industry under health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The findings of this report call into question the ability of the marketplace 
to contain drug prices," Pryor said. "It provides compelling evidence that 
Congress may need to consider more meaningful price restraints." 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton's health care reform proposal would give the government more 
leverage to discourage large drug price increases, the bill would not impose 
strict price controls. Pryor, a leading critic of the pharmaceutical industry, 
did not say what kinds of controls he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. accused Pryor of using the wrong 
benchmarks to measure drug price inflation. It noted that the increase in drug 
prices last year was the lowest since 1974, and compared favorably to a 5.4% 
increase in all health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, meantime, discussed his willingness to compromise on health care 
reform during a closed-door meeting with the nation's governors at the White 
House. According to those who attended, he did not say what changes he would 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President's flexibility on these items have become well known. 
</P>
<P>
 In his State of the Union address last week, the President indicated that the 
one principle on which he will refuse to compromise is that of universal 
coverage for all Americans. By offering to compromise on alliances and spending 
caps, he was responding to Republican criticism that alliances -- regional 
insurance pools -- would create an unwieldy, new bureaucracy and that prices 
cannot be controlled by imposing overall limits on spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the leader of a faction of lawmakers who support a 
government-financed, "single-payer" health care plan similar to the Canadian 
system warned that the White House is making a "very, very dangerous and wrong 
assumption" that it can take those liberal votes for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-payer plan -- the most radical of the health care reform proposals 
-- has 92 co-sponsors in the House. Although these 92 votes are considered 
crucial to passing the President's health care plan, the White House is 
concentrating on winning over lawmakers who support more conservative 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the President's advisers) have simply stopped talking to us. . . . 
There's a fundamental assumption being made up at the White House, which is a 
mistake, and that is that all the single-payer people are just waiting to jump 
on the President's bandwagon," Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) told a group of 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 45 single-payer supporters have also co-sponsored Clinton's plan, 
McDermott described it as nothing more than "political politeness." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, the League of Women Voters and the California-based Kaiser 
Family Foundation announced a $4.1-million nationwide education drive to 
provide "Straight Facts on Health Reform." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign will consist of television, radio and print advertising and 60 
town hall meetings throughout the country between now and the end of April. 
Four town hall meetings are planned in California.

PLAN TO REDIRECT U.S. SCHOOL FUNDS FALTERS; EDUCATION: CLINTON EFFORT TO 
CHANNEL MONEY TO DISTRICTS WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF POOR STUDENTS SPARKS DEBATE. 
LAWMAKERS SEEK TO PROTECT SUBURBAN AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's ambitious plan to channel more money toward 
school districts with large numbers of poor students is faltering and a glimpse 
of where it might be headed could come today at a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat to the initiative comes from middle-class districts that could lose 
federal funds that would be funneled instead, under the Administration's 
proposal, to those with high concentrations of poor children. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate will begin in earnest as a subcommittee of the House Committee on 
Education and Labor begins its review of the multibillion-dollar program, 
called Chapter 1, for educating economically disadvantaged elementary and 
secondary schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireworks are likely as representatives from urban and suburban districts 
fight to conserve every cent that their schools now receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the debate is virtually certain to reflect the trouble that two 
of the Clinton agenda's oft-preached principles -- getting results by 
concentrating money in selected areas and keeping middle-class interests firmly 
in mind -- face in Congress, where representatives traditionally look out for 
their own district's best interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the proposed program's complicated funding formula that awards 
money on a district-wide basis, individual schools with few poor children could 
receive money while schools with large percentages of poor students could get 
no money at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts failed in the 1970s to retarget the current program, which was 
created as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, to the poorest 
schools. But the Administration hopes enough members of Congress can now be 
persuaded to vote for the legislation -- which it contends is for the "overall 
good" -- even though their districts might lose money, said Mike Smith, an 
assistant secretary of the Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one expects the task to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from both sides of the aisle -- including Rep. Dale E. Kildee 
(D-Mich.), chairman of the subcommittee on elementary, secondary and vocational 
education -- are lining up behind an alternate proposal that would protect the 
status quo and use a new formula only for allocating the $700-million funding 
increase that the Administration is seeking for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the alternative plan argue that the Administration's proposal is 
unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The net effect of the Administration's proposal is to increase federal 
funding for high-spending, urban school districts," said Rep. Thomas E. Petri 
(R-Wis.), one of the leaders of the campaign against the Administration's 
proposal. Petri said that his district would lose between 40% and 50% of the 
funding it now receives, if the Administration's version is passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why slash us in order to shovel more money at the big city districts?" Petri 
asked. "It's Robin Hood in reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith said that the alternative proposal "is biased against the cities" 
because, although it favors districts with large percentages of poor children, 
it does not help districts with large numbers of poor children, as the 
Administration's proposal and the current formula do. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent research, the Administration argues, makes it clear that the current 
formula has supported a two-tiered education system in the country -- providing 
a challenging academic curriculum for middle-class children and a watered-down 
remedial curriculum for poor children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kildee-Petri version of the legislation would not change the funding 
mechanism enough to alter this two-track system, Smith argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, the poorest quarter of the nation's counties, which educate 
45% of the poor children, receive 43.4% of all Chapter 1 money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's proposal would increase that to 46.7% next year and to 
almost 50% by 1998. The Kildee-Petri formula would increase it to 43.6%.

 Democrat Joel Hyatt began his U.S. Senate campaign, undaunted that he could be 
hurt by the movie "Philadelphia," which has brought attention to his firm's 
firing of an AIDS-infected lawyer.Hyatt is seeking to replace his 
father-in-law, Democratic Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, who is retiring. The film 
was inspired by dozens of cases, including one involving Hyatt's firm, the 
film's publicist said. Clarence Cain, a senior attorney with Hyatt Legal 
Services in Philadelphia, was fired seven years ago after he learned he had 
AIDS. He sued for discrimination and won $157,000 in 1990. He died two months 
later.

WITNESS SAYS BECKWITH WAS INTRODUCED AS EVERS' KILLER; COURT: SUSPECT ON TRIAL 
FOR THE THIRD TIME IN THE 1963 SLAYING PURPORTEDLY REFERRED TO THE BLACK CIVIL 
RIGHTS LEADER AS A 'CHICKEN-STEALING DOG.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM BOOTH, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Ann Adams told jurors Monday how Byron De La Beckwith was introduced to 
her as "the man who killed Medgar Evers," the civil rights leader shot to death 
three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After the bookkeeper refused to shake his hand, Beckwith told her "he had not 
killed a man," Adams testified Monday, "but a damn chicken-stealing dog -- and 
you know what you have to do when a dog has tasted blood." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in the historic retrial of Beckwith, 73, the jury of eight 
blacks and four whites heard witnesses describe how Beckwith boasted 
enigmatically of killing Evers, the former field secretary of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors also listened to Beckwith's nephew, Reed Massengill, describe his 
uncle's virulent brand of racism, his joy at President John F. Kennedy's 
killing and his suspicion that adding fluoride to drinking water was a plot by 
Jews to make the populace more "docile." 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries of white men failed to reach a verdict when Beckwith stood trial 
for the Evers killing in 1964, but prosecutors here succeeded in reopening the 
case after new witnesses came forward telling tales of Beckwith's veiled 
admissions of the crime and his presence in Jackson the night Evers was shot 
outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith, however, has steadfastly stated that he was 90 miles away in 
Greenwood the night Evers was killed, and two retired Greenwood police officers 
are expected to take the stand again and swear that Beckwith was there when 
Evers was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous testimony has shown that Beckwith's 1917 Enfield rifle with one of 
his fingerprints was found outside Evers' home, and a parade of FBI agents -- 
active and retired -- have testified that the bullet shot at Evers, now lost, 
was probably from the rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith has stated that his rifle was stolen before the slaying.

the blowing up of a building with an American flag on top. The videotape was 
found with other bomb-making books and manuals in the suitcase of Ahmad Ajaj 
when he tried to enter the country with a fake Swedish passport in September, 
1992. He was serving a six-month prison sentence for illegally entering the

1ST U.S. SHUTTLE FLIGHT WITH RUSSIAN BEGINS COUNTDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA began the countdown Monday for the first U.S. shuttle flight with a 
Russian cosmonaut, a seasoned spaceman who will share orbital duties with an 
older yet less experienced American crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground crews began a three-day countdown before dawn for Discovery's liftoff 
at 4:10 a.m. PST Thursday with a crew of six. 
</P>
<P>
 The cosmonaut, Sergei Krikalev, smiled broadly as Discovery's pilot praised 
him as "a man of many talents." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to keep him busy on this flight," pilot Kenneth Reightler Jr. 
promised after arriving at Kennedy Space Center with the rest of the six-member 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission specialists for the flight are Franklin Chang-Diaz, Jan Davis and Ron 
Sega. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day science mission will be only the second time Americans and 
Russians have flown together in space. The first was the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz 
docking. 
</P>
<P>
 Krikalev, 35, already has spent 463 days in space, nine times longer than the 
rest of the shuttle crew combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other person, cosmonaut Musa Manarov, has logged more space time. 
</P>
<P>
 Krikalev also is a champion aerobatic pilot, mechanical engineer and computer 
whiz who showed commander Charles Bolden Jr. a better way to use the shuttle's 
laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Krikalev and his backup, Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Titov, have been 
treated as full-fledged crew members since arriving at the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration in late 1992. Titov, 47, who's spent 368 days in 
space, is scheduled to fly on a shuttle early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cosmonaut shuttle flights are part of an agreement between the United 
States and Russia that also calls for five American astronauts to orbit on 
Russia's space station Mir beginning next year. Up to 10 shuttle-Mir dockings 
are planned, followed in 1997 by construction of a joint space station.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; REVIVAL OF STATE QUAKE INSURANCE PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation calling for revival of a state-run earthquake insurance program 
for homeowners was introduced Monday in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are learning the hard way that repealing the old program was a mistake," 
said Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose), the bill's author. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake insurance program was repealed in 1993 after critics claimed 
that it was bordering on insolvency. If the program had been in place when the 
Northridge quake hit, Areias said, it would have contained about $350 million, 
enough to provide 60,000 to 70,000 Los Angeles homeowners with checks for 
$5,000 or more each. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposed prepaid recovery program would provide homeowners with up to 
$13,000, after a $2,000 deductible, to repair homes damaged by earthquakes, 
Areias said. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a mandatory insurance program and cost the average homeowner $25 
to $75 annually, the amount varying depending on seismic zones, the value of 
the property and the type of structure. Homeowners who failed to pay would face 
a secondary or non-foreclosable lien on their property. Mobil homes and 
condominiums would not be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 County tax collectors would collect the fees. The state Department of Housing 
and Community Affairs would administer the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earthquakes in California are inevitable," Areias said, "and it is 
intelligent public policy to plan ahead for the disaster we know will occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the previous program contended that California, despite its size, 
is not large enough to adequately fund such a repair program and that the state 
is misleading the public into a false sense of security over what the state can 
provide in the event of a major quake. The answer lies in a nationally based 
insurance program, the critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the insurance industry said Monday it has no position on 
Areias' bill, but prefers the national approach, which would cover all types of 
disasters, including damage by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and 
volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Norman Mineta (D-San Jose) has introduced such a bill in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We favor a national approach for two reasons," said Tim Hart of the Assn. of 
California Insurance Companies. "First, there is not enough capacity in 
California to absorb the kind of losses that would be created by a catastrophic 
quake. Secondly, the federal government is obligated to pay its debts and can 
print money."

BIPARTISAN PANEL ON IMMIGRATION FORMED; POLICY: WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO 
PRESSURE BY WILSON AND OTHER GOVERNORS TO SEEK WAYS TO RELIEVE COSTS ASSOCIATED 
WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, pressed by Gov. Pete Wilson and five other 
governors, agreed Monday to form a bipartisan "working group" to push for 
federal legislation to relieve states hit hard by the soaring costs of illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget Director Leon Panetta announced the creation of the group after Wilson 
and others met with several Clinton Cabinet members to make their pitch for 
more federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of tight fiscal restraints, Panetta could make no monetary 
commitments to the governors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that we have a tight budget . . . but we want to respond to 
the problem. The question now is, how do we get it done in Congress?" Panetta 
asked. "We face a fundamental problem. We don't have the strong political 
support on Capitol Hill that we need to move these kinds of initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership between the White House and the governors will focus on three 
areas: education, emergency health care and the incarceration of illegal 
immigrants, Wilson said. States with large numbers of illegal immigrants are 
forced by federal mandates to spend millions of dollars for such services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The costs of providing those services to illegal immigrants . . . denies us 
the ability . . . to provide the services to our own legal residents. And 
that's just terribly wrong," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson wants Congress to supply the money or repeal the federal mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Formation of the working groups points up the political difficulties faced by 
Wilson and the other governors. Because the problem afflicts only some states, 
broad congressional support has been hard to build. The White House needs the 
governors' help in persuading other states to join their cause, Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite long odds against getting the money, Wilson has built $2.3 billion of 
federal funds into his proposed state budget. Wilson said he will work with the 
Administration to seek the money, but conceded that the effort could fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was joined by the governors of Florida, Arizona, Illinois, New Jersey 
and Texas in pushing for the increased federal emphasis on the illegal 
immigration issue.

LOCKYER ELECTED TO SUCCEED ROBERTI AS LEADER OF SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) was unanimously elected state Senate leader 
Monday, succeeding David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) who had served as Senate 
president pro tem for more than 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted 39 to 0 to pick the moderate-to-liberal Lockyer after 
Democrats and the Senate's two independents rejected a GOP effort to install 
Republican Ken Maddy in the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer promised to bring a "slightly different policy emphasis" to the Senate 
leader's job and to "push a little harder . . . for creative solutions to the 
challenges facing our state." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what our constituents all expect," he said. "I hope I can respond to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 He announced that he will expand the Senate's workweek by convening the 
chamber on Monday mornings instead of Monday afternoons and will urge senators 
to get to sessions on time. The Senate is well-known for routinely starting its 
meetings at least 20 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Rob Hurtt, (R-Garden Grove), who has urged a more partisan stance by 
Republican lawmakers, was the only senator who refused to vote for Lockyer.

 Roberti indicated several months ago that he planned to step down early this 
year to focus on his campaign for state treasurer. He is also trying to fend 
off a recall effort backed by several gun groups.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; VALLEY SLOWLY REGAINS ITS BALANCE; RECOVERY: 
POSITIVE SIGNS SHOW RESIDENTS ARE GETTING BACK ON THEIR FEET. VICTIMS IN TENT 
CITIES ARE DWINDLING, WHILE THE NUMBER SEEKING ASSISTANCE LEVELS OFF.

<P>
 Even as government officials Monday increased the cost of the Northridge 
quake, and victims still grappled with federal aid problems, optimistic signs 
appeared indicating that the San Fernando Valley was slowly beginning to return 
to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department canceled full emergency mobilization, with 
its 12-hour workdays, and returned to eight-hour shifts. Detectives went back 
to the routine business of solving crimes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of quake victims seeking federal financial assistance appeared to 
have leveled off, and tent cities set up to house them were becoming emptier by 
the hour, state and federal disaster officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Residents have determined they would rather be somewhere else," said Mike 
Allen, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "They want to 
get back home, and if that isn't possible, better accommodations are available 
at shelters and elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some quake victims continued expressing complaints over government aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge student Jose Vela buttonholed FEMA Director James Lee 
Witt on Monday as Witt toured the Red Cross' new "super service center" in 
Northridge. Visibly anxious, Vela said he was unable to find a landlord willing 
to accept the temporary housing voucher that he received from the U. S. Housing 
and Urban Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't found anything," Vela told the head of the nation's disaster 
response agency. "They won't accept the certificates." 
</P>
<P>
 Witt, clad in jeans and cowboy boots, told Vela that he would speak with HUD 
Secretary Henry Cisneros about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, the FEMA director said he and Cisneros already are aware of 
potential problems with uncooperative apartment owners, but he did not know if 
the problem is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them are" accepting the certificates, Witt said. "I don't know if all 
of them are." 
</P>
<P>
 Witt contended, however, that the successes in the governmental response to 
the nation's costliest disaster have far outweighed the failures. "I'm not 
saying we didn't have problems early," Witt said, "but we have acted quickly to 
fix them." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as he made his way through the vast white tent housing the Red Cross 
super center at the corner of Tampa Avenue and Plummer Street, Witt was met by 
many who were glad to have the government's help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody from FEMA has been incredible," Ken Field, a disabled 40-year-old 
whose Canoga Park home was nearly destroyed, told Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 At an impromptu news conference, Witt announced that well over 210,000 
applications for disaster relief were processed in the first 10 days after the 
Northridge earthquake -- equaling the number of those applying for aid in the 
first six months after Hurricane Andrew, the previous most costly American 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very large disaster," Witt said. "And every time there's an 
aftershock, we find there's a little more damage." 
</P>
<P>
 As aftershocks and damage reports continue, the Administration is boosting its 
request for federal aid to $8.6 billion, surpassing the $8.5 billion spent 
jointly on aid for Hurricane Andrew in Florida, Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and 
Typhoon Omar. Last summer's Midwest floods cost about $4.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt said FEMA already has cut $59 million worth of checks to help quake 
victims with housing and other assistance. But still, he acknowledged, there 
are many others just now coming forward to ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, faced with still-rising damage estimates, the Clinton Administration 
plans to ask Congress for an additional $2 billion in housing, small business 
and other federal aid for victims of the Northridge earthquake -- including 
another $1.2 billion for FEMA, Administration officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as $1 billion of that could go toward paying for the rapidly growing 
costs of the Jan. 17 quake, which killed 61 people and produced damage that may 
total $30 billion, administration and congressional officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers of those seeking federal assistance may soon start to decline, 
Witt said, because "we're noticing our applications are starting to peak." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The first contract for reconstruction of damaged freeway bridges was let for 
$14.8 million, and officials predicted the work on the Golden State Freeway in 
the Gavin Canyon area would be completed by early June. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of Emergency Services, said 
208,844 people have applied for temporary rental assistance, and FEMA has 
responded by mailing 12,831 checks totaling $39,398,801. More than 7,300 
applicants have applied for Small Business Administration loans, and 
$16,779,800 has been disbursed. And 112,783 applicants have asked for emergency 
food stamps, and the government has issued $25,477,295 worth already, Andrews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fourteen schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District reopened after 
two weeks of structural inspections. At least 21 quake-damaged schools in the 
sprawling district remain closed, but officials said some of those campuses 
will reopen later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council's Budget and 
Finance Committee, estimated that the city will lose at least $33 million in 
revenue as a result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman said utility tax revenues will drop because of power outages, 
closed businesses and destroyed homes. Property taxes will drop because of 
reduced property values. Municipal Court fines will dip because police officers 
-- diverted to other duties -- are not writing as many traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, damage to retail businesses will reduce the city's share 
of sales taxes, business taxes will drop accordingly and hesitancy in 
purchasing real estate will trim documentary transfer tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before the earthquake, we were facing an approximately $150-million 
shortfall for the 1994-95 fiscal year," Yaroslavsky said. "With an additional 
$33-million loss, we are looking at a very serious money problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * Lucy Jones, a seismologist for the U. S. Geological Survey, said the area 
was averaging two or three aftershocks of magnitude 3.0 or greater a day -- 
compared to 150 on the day of the quake. She predicted that the aftershocks 
would continue to taper off in frequency and strength, although warning that 
there could be another 5.0 in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Building and Safety Department said 43,449 structures had been 
inspected by midday Monday, with a total of 26,920 dwelling units declared 
unsafe for occupancy. The Red Cross said 4,177 people were still being housed 
in 30 indoor shelters and an additional 518 were camping in tents pitched 
outside the shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army sheltered 492 indoors in one shelter and an additional 382 
in two tent camps erected by the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department, confronted with the problem of trying to 
keep people out of buildings that have been declared unsafe, announced that it 
has drafted a policy for arresting anyone who persists in repeatedly returning 
to those structures. 
</P>
<P>
 But detectives for the first time were returning to solving a backlog of cases 
put on hold during the quake, and patrol officers once again were responding to 
more than just life-threatening calls, as mandated under the disaster 
mobilization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're returning to business as usual," said Lt. Bob Warren, acting head 
of detectives in West Valley Division, where much of the quake damage occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Red Cross centers and even in the schools, many were struggling to gain 
some semblance of normalcy in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Red Cross super center -- so called because it provides up to four 
times as many claim processors as other centers -- workers were still busy 
providing victims with vouchers to buy food, clothing, health and medical aid, 
temporary housing and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 By giving them vouchers that they can use wherever they choose, "people can 
take control of their own lives," said Red Cross spokesman Randy Ackley. "It 
gets them back into a routine. It helps the local merchants too." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants can redeem the vouchers through the Red Cross. Ackley said the 
relief agency expects to spend at least $31.4 million to help quake victims. 
The super center, which was opened Saturday to alleviate overcrowding at other 
Red Cross centers, was set up to handle as many as 1,000 earthquake victims per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon Monday, it had processed 446 people seeking vouchers to cover 
rent, food, clothing and even appliances lost in the quake. "It's not been 
overwhelming," said Jean Reynolds, a volunteer from Orange County, "but it's 
been steadily busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Valley, children returned to school. Students at Canoga Park 
Elementary School met with a psychologist to discuss their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did anyone have animals that went real weird?" asked psychologist Robert 
Butterworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hamster hid under his hay," said one youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hamster was smart," said the psychologist. "He knew enough to get under 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Life for commuters continued to be a challenge, but there were signs that 
struggle was easing up a bit too. Metrolink officials said a new station on the 
Los Angeles-to-Lancaster line opened at Acton as scheduled Monday, with another 
new station expected to open in Santa Clarita this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Stanger, Metrolink's executive director, said station platforms in 
Sylmar and Burbank have been lengthened to accommodate the longer trains that 
have run since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest figures, the death toll remained at 61. A total of 
7,757 have been treated and released from hospitals, with another 1,496 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 In quake-affected areas, about 42,000 buildings have been inspected. Of those, 
18,900 have been deemed inhabitable, 6,300 partially inhabitable and 2,700 
uninhabitable, according to the state Office of Emergency Services. But many 
remain to be inspected. FEMA officials estimate 45,319 residences were damaged 
or destroyed.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE LOSS AT CSUN MAY REACH $350 MILLION; 
EDUCATION: CAMPUS OFFICIALS EXPECT TO RECOUP MOST OF THE EXPENSE FROM STATE AND 
FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF FUNDS. 
</P>

 Earthquake damage to the Cal State Northridge campus may reach as high as $350 
million, school officials said Monday, an estimate that would make it one of 
the largest losses yet incurred by any public institution in Southern 
California due to the destructive Jan. 17 temblor.  
</P>
<P>
 The figure is many times the tens-of-millions range that university officials 
offered shortly after a 6.6-magnitude earthquake that was centered nearby 
rocked Southern California. Although university officials as yet have not been 
able to tally a precise accounting, CSUN Vice President of Administration 
Elliot Mininberg said the $250- to $350-million range was his best guess based 
on an assessment of the campus. Cal State University Chancellor Barry Munitz 
and other state officials have been discussing similar figures. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said they expect to recoup most of their losses from 
federal and state disaster relief as well as some possible assistance from the 
Cal State system and state Legislature. But CSUN officials acknowledged that 
they do not yet know what portion of the loss they will have to absorb. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Bentley-Adler, a spokeswoman for the 20-campus state university 
system, said she believed that the earthquake losses at Northridge are the most 
substantial to any campus in the system's history. None of the other Cal State 
campuses in Southern California suffered any significant earthquake damage, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of CSUN remained without electricity, natural gas or water service 
Monday. University officials after the quake deliberately shut off the 
utilities to prevent further damage from broken pipes and other structural 
problems. Most of the university's more than 2,000 faculty and other employees 
remained at home on paid administrative leave, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 University spokesman Bruce Erickson said the campus plans to reopen Feb. 14, 
two weeks late, with most classes and offices likely to be held in 250 to 350 
modular classrooms that the university has ordered. The first such classroom 
was being set up Monday, although truck delivery of the units was being slowed 
by high winds, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only building on campus that has been declared a total loss thus far is 
the four-level, $15-million Parking Structure C that was heavily damaged in the 
original earthquake and then collapsed further in an aftershock. As for other 
buildings, Erickson said, "I don't know of any plans to tear anything down 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's latest review of its major buildings listed the following as partly or 
entirely unstable and closed: 
</P>
<P>
 The five-story administration building, the fine arts building, the south 
library building housing much of the university's computer operations, building 
12 of the University Park Apartments and the theater building of the University 
Student Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oviatt Library, the campus' most distinctive building, which houses more 
than 1 million books, will require asbestos abatement and some demolition work 
to remove unstable areas. The science complex suffered chemical and biological 
contamination and a fire. And crews Monday worked to remove the unstable south 
stairwell of the Sierra Tower complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Kepner, a Pasadena-based spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, said public agencies that suffered damage in the quake will be eligible 
for 100% reimbursement for their initial outlays, and then 90% for subsequent 
expenditures. But because of the numerous aftershocks, trying to sort out those 
figures will be difficult, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of disaster relief officials is due to survey the CSUN campus this week 
to make a more detailed assessment of the cost of the quake damage, said state 
Office of Emergency Services spokeswoman Lisa Covington. Similarly, CSUN 
President Blenda J. Wilson has asked her staff to prepare more detailed 
numbers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Days after the earthquake, CSUN officials talked of damages in the tens of 
millions. At a Cal State Board of Trustees meeting last week, Munitz gave a 
$150-million estimate, then told reporters over the weekend that the number had 
risen to $200 million. By today, the estimate had risen again to the range 
offered by Mininberg.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE'S SHAKING SET SOME THINGS RIGHT; NATURE: 
MANY SAY THE TEMBLOR FIXED ITEMS THAT WERE BROKEN, INCLUDING A BALKY COPY 
MACHINE. ONE MAN'S BACK STOPPED HURTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the havoc it wrought, all the rubble it left behind, the Northridge 
quake also fixed a few things. 
</P>
<P>
 A broken wall clock, for example, that began ticking after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," said Sheila Shaler, whose Chatsworth home suffered heavy damage. 
"I have a Westminster chime clock and it hadn't been running for six months. It 
really startled me when it chimed." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other reports of resurrection by rock and roll. A chronically 
jammed door in Hollywood now swings freely. A Hermosa Beach car radio lost its 
irritating buzz. These and other such instances supplied quirky justification 
for that time-honored home remedy: If something doesn't work, jiggle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Shaler said of her clock, "I think the earthquake shook the 
you-know-what out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, such minor miracles pale in comparison to the billions of dollars 
in damages. In the past two weeks, appliance shops have been overwhelmed with 
requests to replace everything from shattered oven doors to torn water-heater 
pipes. Scores of televisions and computers required attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is human nature to search for silver linings. A bright side to each 
horrific event. A troublesome photocopier that now performs without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the feeder, the thing that feeds paper into the machine," said Robert 
Manuwal, a Ventura Boulevard attorney in Tarzana. "I had a copier guy coming 
every other day and he couldn't fix it. Now it works fine. It's really 
strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Strange, but not unexpected. Repairmen say that quake-inflicted repairs often 
involve electrical contact points that have fallen out of alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever had a flashlight that didn't work and, if you shook it, you 
could get it to switch on?" asked Scott Kassner, general manager of a North 
Hills appliance store. He explained that shaking sometimes causes contact 
points to reunite. "You make just enough of a circuit for the power to flow 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing may have happened, on a widespread scale, during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the repairs were mechanical, though. Phillip Frazier of Cerritos had 
suffered from an aching back for 10 years. "It hurt him every morning he woke 
up," said his wife, Shirley. Every morning, that is, until the Monday before 
last. Since the earthquake, he has felt no pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks maybe the shaking of the bed shook something into place in his 
back," his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaking adjusted much larger structures. Rigid plates that compose the 
Earth's outer shell were suffering from a good deal of strain before the quake 
provided relief. Crooked house frames were similarly jarred into alignment. 
Marty Brastow of Topanga Canyon reports that the crack in her front porch, 
opened by a previous quake, has now closed considerably. She can tell because 
kitty litter from the cat box on the porch no longer gets stuck in the crack. 
</P>
<P>
 In other homes, doors and windows that had been sticking now open. For 
homeowners who suffered the reverse -- jammed doors -- there may be hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people to wait till the next one and maybe it will straighten itself 
out," said John Smith, who owns a Los Angeles carpentry service. "Nature works 
in funny ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Its effects also extend beyond the purely practical. For the past year, artist 
Kilgore Bohorquez has been hard at work in a West Hills garage, assembling a 
massive piece that blends classical sculpture with the clutter of debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole garage settled and shifted," Bohorquez said, explaining that his 
artwork suffered partial damage but, in the process, became aesthetically 
complete. "The earthquake added a finishing touch. It added an element that I 
love, the element of spontaneity. There's no way I can be as spontaneous as an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 And the picture quality of his aging color television set improved to boot, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But earthquake-caused repairs may prove short-lived. Reunited contact points 
are likely to shift out of touch again. Pendulum clocks that were given a 
jump-start by the shaking will probably run down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Coffey, a Granada Hills clock repairman, says it reminds him of a radio 
evangelist who broadcast in Bakersfield during the 1950s. The evangelist 
claimed to repair broken watches if listeners would lay the watches atop their 
radios during his show. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did this when the weather was cold. People didn't realize that some 
watches don't work in cold weather, the grease gets too hard inside," Coffey 
said. "When his hour show was over, the watches were all warmed up and running. 
But they eventually stopped. It's the same with clocks that were fixed in the 
earthquake. They'll only work for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaler's clock, alas, stopped ticking several days ago. But while clearing 
broken glass and the rubble of fallen chimneys, she can take small comfort from 
the unusual silence in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My refrigerator used to sound like a small diesel truck," she said. "A 
repairman came out twice before the earthquake and said the sound was normal. 
Now it's purring like a kitten."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; PROPERTY DAMAGE TOTALS $31.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of San Fernando estimates it suffered $31.5 million in private 
property damage after the Jan. 17 earthquake, including potentially crippling 
blows to 63 buildings and serious damage to 835 others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a lot of damage," City Administrator Mary Strenn said after 
releasing the first official figures Monday."But when you look at our city 
compared to communities like Northridge, we came out OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the private property damage, San Fernando suffered $1.2 million in 
damage to public facilities and infrastructure, according to the estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the public-sector damage, about $800,000, came from burst water 
mains, said Strenn.  
</P>
<P>
 Although businesses suffered from the quake, the bulk of the city's 
private-sector monetary damage -- $29 million -- came in residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 63 buildings declared unsafe, 44 were residential; of the 835 where 
limited access is allowed, 784 were residential. The loss of residential units 
hits San Fernando's population hard -- an average of 4.4 people occupy each 
rental unit in San Fernando, compared to an average tenant density of 2.6 
valleywide, according to 1990 U. S. Census Bureau statistics.  
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando will seek help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
recoup its infrastructure losses, but should be able to get by on budget 
reserves, said Strenn. GEOFFREY MOHAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; ANTIQUE ROW IS HARD HIT AS BRICKS FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although earthquake damage was relatively light in Canoga Park, the Jan. 17 
temblor took a toll on what some consider the community's best asset -- the 
Sherman Way antique district. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every building has been condemned in the antique mall on Sherman Way 
between De Soto Avenue and Topanga Canyon Boulevard. More than a dozen antique 
shops in the area have been forced to close, and numerous vendors and 
cooperatives who rented space within them are also out of business, said Stan 
Goldman, owner of Turn of the Century Antiques and a founding merchant of 
"Antique Row." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the shops were housed in one two-story brick building. Other stores 
occupied neighboring older brick structures. The brick buildings gave Antique 
Row both character and fragility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brick is brick, and brick moves," said Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The antique merchants will meet this week to discuss options. Hopefully, that 
won't mean moving out of the area, Goldman said. But many antique vendors may 
not have the luxury of waiting until the buildings are fixed, and may choose to 
relocate, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, it would be bad news for Canoga Park, which has relied on 
antique shops to help preserve its retail shopping core. At a time when 
outlying malls were draining the area of viable businesses, antiques came in 
and filled the gap. The process, which took nearly 20 years, may have been 
reversed in a single night by the quake, Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time, downtown Canoga Park was dying. Antiques really brought it back 
to life again," he said. "It's like a little family -- we would like to keep it 
together." The damage to Antique Row is a blow to community leaders, who fear a 
neighborhood decline without it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very dismal as far as businesses goes," said Aline Hausman, executive 
director of the local Chamber of Commerce. "We were hurting already." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Canoga Park, businesses were resuming normal operations. The two 
closest malls, Topanga Plaza and Fallbrook Mall, have partially reopened. 
Topanga Plaza's parking lots were filled over the weekend as shoppers returned 
to the damaged mall. JILL LEOVY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; EARTHQUAKE DEALS SETBACK TO ARTS DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as North Hollywood had set its sights on an economic recovery, spurred by 
the proposed NoHo Arts District and a revamped Laurel Plaza Mall, the 
Northridge earthquake has shaken the community's dreams as easily as it rattled 
the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show must go on. "It's going to take a lot more than this to put us 
out of business," said Dan Hirsch, owner of NoHo Studios at Lankershim and 
Magnolia boulevards, which has been red-tagged. "We expect we'll be back up and 
running in three to four weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jim Mahfet, executive director of the Universal City/North 
Hollywood Chambers of Commerce, the quake forced dozens of small businesses and 
several large commercial enterprises temporarily out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Plaza Mall on Oxnard Street was perhaps the hardest hit. A spokeswoman 
said structural damage could force all but one of the mall's 33 stores -- 
Robinsons-May -- to remain closed for one to two months.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the damage, a spokesman for mall owner Forest City Development said 
the firm plans to continue to seek city approval of a proposed $150-million 
renovation plan for the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley Plaza, an outdoor mall on Victory Boulevard, it will be at least two 
months before screenings resume at the United Artists Theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovated El Portal Theatre, which was supposed to begin its first 
production this Saturday, suffered about $1 million in damage and has been 
declared unsafe. Bob Caine, managing director of the theater, could not 
estimate the time it would take to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Renegade Theatre on Magnolia Boulevard lost one of its two stages 
during the quake, and its next production will be produced at the West End 
Theater in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how long it's going to take to repair the damage because FEMA 
and the Small Business Administration does not loan money to theaters," said 
David Cox, executive director of American Renegade. He estimated damage at 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Both theaters were considered linchpins in the plan to revitalize a portion of 
North Hollywood into the NoHo Arts District. The proposal would allow artists 
to set up galleries, studios and other businesses in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caine and others insist that the setbacks will be only temporary. "It's a 
way to test your mettle," said Caine. "If you are really committed to what you 
want to do, you find a way." JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; SOME REGAINING PRE-QUAKE RHYTHM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than any place in the San Fernando Valley, it was Northridge, home to the 
quake's epicenter, that received the bulk of the press coverage after the 
quake. The photos of the shattered Bullock's department store at Northridge 
Fashion Center and the Northridge Meadows apartment complex have become the 
defining images of this disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all in Northridge are willing to accept this notoriety. Despite vivid 
examples of devastation covered on the news, life for many has regained 
something similar to its pre-quake rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a cousin in Florida who keeps wanting to send me care packages!" 
laughed Gloria Rothenberg, past North Valley Homeowners' Assn. president, whose 
house is standing firm. "I keep trying to tell her there's no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Prince, president of a Northridge building maintenance firm, and 
land-use chairman for the Chamber of Commerce, said the press images may have 
given an unrealistic perception of how widespread the damage really is. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homes and businesses escaped with little damage beyond broken windows, 
cracked chimneys and fallen block walls, he said. And despite devastating 
losses to many, Northridge is fortunate that it is home to a high concentration 
of construction-related businesses and contracting firms, many of which are 
thriving in the post-quake economy, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the quake, for example, Northridge Lumber did a week's worth 
of business in a single day, said Pat Hawthorne, president and part owner of 
the firm. Still, many seeking a silver lining have had to look pretty hard. 
Northridge Chamber President Jim Beal said he has been discouraged by the 
number of people he has talked to who are making plans to leave town. 
</P>
<P>
 Beal, his voice strained, said his home suffered severe damage and his law 
firm was obliterated. "I don't have any place to hang my hat," he said. 
Earthquake damage, the temporary closure of Cal State Northridge, which 
provides a customer base for many small businesses, and job-loss due to the 
closure of the mall, may put many small, marginal shops out of business, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Beal said he sees hope in the fact that many badly damaged businesses, 
including the area's grocery stores, seemed to have rebounded quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angelenos have always had short memories," said maintenance firm owner 
Prince. "I'm not gloomy. We have seen earthquakes before. They come, and they 
go away." JILL LEOVY

VALLEY INTERVIEW: JUDGE ATTEMPTS TO DISPEL NEGATIVE FEELINGS TOWARD JURY DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thom Mrozek, Times Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Robert M. Letteau supervises the 26 departments in Van Nuys Superior 
Court and is charged with managing the civil caseload, as well as working with 
the on-site jury commissioner to ensure a stable jury pool. Letteau was 
interviewed about the experience of jury service by Times correspondent Thom 
Mrozek. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Many people see jury duty as nothing more than a hassle. Assuming 
that the vast majority of people dislike jury duty -- even if they have never 
been summoned -- why has this general consensus developed?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think it is a matter of either looking at the glass as half full or 
half empty. If you want to look at jury service as a distraction, as something 
that stands in the way of what we normally do, you might understand why people 
have negative feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 To look at the glass being half full, one of the first things I tell jurors 
is: This is a terrific opportunity. It's putting on a different kind of hat. 
It's a walk in a different direction. In all my years, I don't think I have 
ever had anybody tell me they didn't enjoy the experience. And not all the 
trials are interesting, but it is interesting being a juror and a 
decision-maker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Isn't it the perceived lack of efficiency in the court system that scares 
people away from jury duty?  
</P>
<P>
 A. In a facility the size of Van Nuys, I believe that it's handled just about 
as efficiently as it can by very hard-working people who do have some real 
consideration for the very valuable time and the needs of potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. A complaint often heard, both in civil and criminal trials, is that even 
after jurors are selected, they spend a great deal of time waiting in a 
hallway. Do the courts work to avoid problems such as that?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We as judges talk about the need to be sensitive to the value of jurors' 
time, which is a precious commodity. Most of the judges are very conscientious 
about sticking to assigned starting times. I have always told jurors in my 
courtroom that if we're delayed as little as four or five minutes for something 
unforeseen, I will have my court staff go outside and tell the jurors that 
we're awfully sorry and we will start a little late. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you think that is the norm in the rest of the courthouse? After all, a 
five-minute delay is only an instant in "court time."  
</P>
<P>
 A. In my experience, it's much easier to manage civil cases. In a criminal 
court, the circumstance may be such that as a matter of fundamental fairness to 
the defendant, and given the constitutional requirements, the judge may have to 
be much more accommodating to the lawyers when matters not earlier identified 
suddenly take away from the time allocated to jury proceedings. I think that is 
unfortunate, but I am not sure it is avoidable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. It's been several months since Los Angeles County courts returned to the 
10-day period for jury service. You had a five-day program for about one year, 
but administrators determined it was not working.  
</P>
<P>
 A. If you work from the premise that it's going to be one trial or five days, 
it sounds great. The only problem is that companies start tailoring their jury 
duty policies to allow only five days. So if a juror is not immediately sent 
out and selected for a case, the next thing you hear is, "My employer is only 
going to pay for five days and this is going to be a real financial hardship." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about the one day/one trial system used in some other jurisdictions? 
On the first day you either know you're going to be on a jury, or else you're 
free to go.  
</P>
<P>
 A. Let me tell you what I think is wrong with that. I think employers, for the 
most part, can make adjustments if they know one or two months in advance that 
a given employee is going to have a limited period of time on jury duty. If you 
have one day or one trial, you're going to have, with greater frequency, 
employers saying they didn't plan on this employee being selected and not 
available for five or more days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I have noticed over the past several years that the overwhelming majority 
of potential jurors -- perhaps 90% or 95% -- fall into four categories: 
retirees, students on break, government workers and employees of large 
corporations.  
</P>
<P>
 A. I agree, but it doesn't concern me. I think if you have a small business 
with only a few employees, then it presents a real hardship to lose someone for 
an indefinite period of time. You anticipate that it will be less than 10 days, 
but it can be longer. You have to recognize it's going to be much more 
difficult for a small business than it is for General Electric or Walt Disney, 
for example. I think we just have to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do the four types of people generally seen in the jury assembly room really 
represent a jury of your peers, especially because it seems to me the majority 
of people that show up for jury duty are retired people.  
</P>
<P>
 A. I think it's skewed somewhat by the reality that certain people -- retirees 
for example, by virtue of their time availability -- may have a greater 
enthusiasm for jury service. If we send out jury questionnaires, we are more 
likely to get responses from retired people who are anxious to put as much back 
into the system as they can after their retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no problem if the jury pool is slightly skewed in favor of those people 
who have a greater availability of time. I just think that's a practical 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 I think these juries make terrific decisions, better decisions than could be 
made by 12 judges, because they do represent a cross-section of the community, 
maybe not a totally pure cross-section, but nonetheless a good, a fair, a 
representative cross-section. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about the $5 a day that jurors make?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It is a pitifully small amount. It was $10, but this was reduced because of 
budget constraints. This is such a nominal sum that most people look at it as 
something that is virtually nonexistent. If I had my druthers, I think it would 
be great for jurors to be recompensed for the true cost of their services. That 
would be along the lines of what they make in the labor market, and that would 
be a figure many times $5. I think $5 is almost an insult. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You send out questionnaires before a person gets a summons for jury 
service. But if I get a questionnaire and throw it out, nothing is done. 
Shouldn't the county go after these scofflaws, and shouldn't people be more 
actively encouraged to become part of the system?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I think they should be actively encouraged, but if someone in my court says 
that they don't want to be a juror, then I'm not going to make them be a juror. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a privilege to be a juror, to be a decision-maker, to be a judge, to be a 
trier of fact. If someone doesn't want to be part of it, then I prefer to have 
them somewhere else, outside my courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some people would say that's fine because they never want to serve as a 
juror. But, you know what, these people end up as litigants. I tell jurors that 
I hope when they leave my court that they feel if they were litigants they 
would be happy to be judged by someone having their own mentality, their own 
frame of reference, their own sense of fairness and fair play.

TARZANA MAN IS CHARGED IN TATTOOING OF TEEN-AGE GIRL; LAW: THE CASE MAY BE THE 
FIRST TIME THAT THE PROHIBITION IS INVOKED LOCALLY. A CITY ATTORNEY SAYS YOUTH 
WAS TOLD IT WOULD WASH OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In what may be the first local use of the law banning the tattooing of minors, 
prosecutors have charged a Tarzana man with tattooing a 16-year-old girl who 
mistakenly thought the artwork could be washed off. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office on Friday charged Edward Flores, 27, with placing a 
tattoo of a rose on the right arm of Rebecca Bateman, a 10th-grade student who 
lives in Flores' apartment building on Clark Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess what she thought is he was writing it with a pen," said Deputy City 
Atty. Martha A. Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred New Year's Eve in Flores' apartment, according to 
authorities, who said Flores put temporary tattoos on several other people 
during the same gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked him if it would come off," Gutierrez said, and Flores told the 
teen-ager that "it would not be permanent, it would wash off in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Bateman's family contacted police when the 2-inch-by-5-inch rose tattoo did 
not come off. 
</P>
<P>
 After the complaint was made, police went to Flores' apartment, where they 
recovered a small tattooing device. "The rig they confiscated operated on two 
D-cell (batteries)," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they were not aware of any prior cases involving the unlawful 
tattooing of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said her office mailed Flores notice of the charges. The letter 
orders him to appear in Van Nuys Municipal Court on March 1 for an arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of six months in County Jail 
and a possible $1,000 fine.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SEVERAL COUNCIL HOPEFULS FAIL TO QUALIFY FOR 
BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council hopeful Harold E. Smith failed to qualify to have his name appear 
on the April ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 59-year-old automotive machinist, failed to submit the required 
signatures of 20 registered voters within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lancaster, two of the 15 City Council hopefuls also failed to qualify. 
Neither Roger Price, 39, or Belinda Warren, 34, met the filing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Smith, Price and Warren did not submit enough valid signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The disqualification of Price and Warren leaves 13 candidates, including three 
incumbents, on the ballot in Lancaster. Three four-year term council seats are 
available in the April 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Smith on the ballot in Palmdale, there will be 13 council candidates, 
including two incumbents, vying for two four-year seats. Four residents, 
including the incumbent, are seeking the two-year term mayor's post. 
</P>

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TECHNOLOGY, MUSCLE HELP STRICKEN LIBRARY; 
RECOVERY: THOUSANDS OF WATER-DAMAGED BOOKS AT VALENCIA OUTLET WILL BE SALVAGED 
THROUGH VACUUM FREEZE DRYING. BRANCH WILL BE CLOSED 90 DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A mix of high-tech repairs and low-tech muscle is rescuing books and 
periodicals from the Valencia Library, which was hit harder by the Jan. 17 
earthquake than any of Los Angeles County's 87 library outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch will be closed 90 days. While there was no structural damage, 
one-fourth of the library's 155,000 books, periodicals and other publications 
sustained water damage after the 6.6-magnitude earthquake ruptured pipes on the 
building's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked when I got to Valencia," said Robert Seal, library area manager 
for the north county region. "Think of the worst earthquake movie you've ever 
seen -- it was that bad. Books were four feet deep off the shelves." 
</P>
<P>
 Initial estimates are that $500,000 in materials were lost. Reference books, 
government publications and magazines bore the brunt of the water damage 
because of their proximity to broken pipes. Virtually untouched were books in 
the children's section on the library's west side. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7,500 to 8,000 books will be salvaged through vacuum freeze drying, Seal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stronger the vacuum, the lower temperature it takes to boil water," Seal 
said. "They freeze-dry the books, put heat into the vacuum and the frozen water 
in the book is converted directly to steam." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeze-drying is expected to save the library thousands of dollars in 
replacement expenses -- it costs $1.25 to $1.50 to freeze-dry a book -- but it 
was the low-tech muscle power of volunteers that saved most of the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 volunteers and library staffers worked three 14-hour days to 
retrieve, catalogue and box materials. The long hours saved 80% of the books 
and periodicals from additional damage by removing them from the wet, 
quake-rattled structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Water had already flooded much of the library by the time Bobbie Norwood, 
circulation assistant for the library who lives in Saugus, entered the 
structure three hours after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was horrified," said Norwood, the first person to enter the building. "I 
couldn't believe it, because there hadn't been that much damage to my home." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a sheriff's deputy, Norwood turned off water to the building 
and prevented more flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24,000-square-foot library was built during 1971 and opened in May, 1972. 
This is the first time such a large-scale re-shelving of materials has been 
required. The entire library was re-shelved by sections in the late 1980s when 
the building was re-carpeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are unsure what long-term impact the earthquake will have upon 
library services. Hours of operation for the Newhall and Canyon Country 
branches, slashed to two days a week during county budget cutting, have been 
boosted to three days a week for as long as the Valencia branch remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Country Library will be open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays; 1 to 8 p.m. 
Wednesdays; and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays. Newhall Library is scheduled to 
reopen Wednesday, and will be open 1 to 8 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays and 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Fridays.

OJAI VALLEY TAKES ON THE 'BLACK ORB'; ACTIVISM: FIGHT AGAINST A NATIONAL 
WEATHER SERVICE TOWER IS THE RESIDENTS' LATEST CAUSE. LIKE IT OR NOT, THE 
ARDENT GROUP HAS BECOME A POTENT POLITICAL FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ojai is a well-read, well-educated hamlet that does not easily take no for an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Its residents are more likely to vote than those elsewhere in Ventura County, 
they mobilize quickly and they do not take to those they consider a threat to 
the quality of life in the verdant Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Ojai activists have derailed a would-be landfill, squelched a 
petroleum plant expansion, felled a university site, muscled into a private 
golf resort's development plans and filed numerous lawsuits to protect their 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not -- and many clearly do not -- citizen activists in the Ojai 
Valley have become a political force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very, very bright people," said attorney Mitchel B. Kahn, who 
represented the waste management firm that last year lost a bid to open a 
landfill in a nearby canyon. "Together, they make quite a formidable group." 
</P>
<P>
 A higher percentage of Ojai residents hold college degrees and library cards 
than in Ventura County as a whole. But some say that the location beneath the 
TopaTopa Mountains contributes to the town's individualism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's geographical," said Greg Helms of the Environmental Defense Center, a 
Santa Barbara legal advocacy firm that handles lawsuits for several groups in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you live in the Ojai Valley, you're together in a kind of village," he 
said. "It's a sort of an Old America feeling about the community that lends 
itself to public participation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at USA Petroleum do not like to talk about Ojai's activism. They are 
apparently still smarting from a citizens panel that 10 years ago thwarted a 
planned $100-million expansion at the firm's Petrochem refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 96 acres have been up for sale ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest political battle cry was sounded after the National Weather Service 
began erecting a 98-foot radar tower atop Sulphur Peak in the upper Ojai 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The tower will greatly enhance their ability to monitor thunderstorms, wind 
currents and other atmospheric conditions, weather service officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Information gleaned from the new system -- designed to replace an aging tower 
in Los Angeles -- will be shared with federal air traffic controllers and 
military brass to help track flight paths and plan strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is urgent that the Sulphur Mountain radar become operational as soon as 
possible," said Thomas Potter, regional director of the weather service. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one told those who live along the pricey ridge that the so-called 
"black orb" was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Upper Ojai residents awoke one crisp morning in early December in the shadow 
of what looked to them like a huge black ball nesting above a thick steel 
scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days they stood in front of a Ventura County Superior Court judge 
arguing for, and receiving, a temporary restraining order prohibiting 
completion of the weather-tracking project. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks since, the government has condemned a portion of a driveway that 
leads to the site, threatened to arrest protesters and unleashed federal 
lawyers to ensure that the project is not delayed further. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, a federal judge sided with the government and refused to issue a 
restraining order blocking construction of the project. Another hearing is set 
for Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the radar tower point to research that possibly links higher 
instances of cancer, birth defects, leukemia and other maladies to the kind of 
low-level radiation emitted from the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a highly educated community," said David Hedman, an upper Ojai 
resident who fought the Weldon Canyon dump and is one of the plaintiffs in the 
weather station lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear those fighting the radar and other ecological-legal battles tell it, 
the Ojai Valley is one of the last resting places of popular rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina V. Shelley, an Ojai councilwoman who served a stint in the Marine Corps, 
calls the activist sentiment a mix of Old West tenacity and sheer grit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I operate with when I'm speaking for the community," she said. 
"Don't let go. Don't even consider failing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranch owner Kim Bonsall knows that community doggedness from personal 
experience. She ran headlong into it last year when the Bonsall family was 
about to allow a landfill on part of its 6,500-acre spread in Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire how quickly they got organized," Bonsall said. "But I don't admire 
what they said once they got organized. For any project that goes on, 
(activists) are very quick to say something negative before having all the 
facts in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonsall is not alone. Many private attorneys and local officials have been 
forced to answer to Ojai-based environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do keep me on my toes, no doubt about that," said Richard H. Baldwin, 
director of the county Air Pollution Control District. "They confront us by 
meetings, letters, what have you. Elsewhere in the county, that's not 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 But confrontation can also be an asset, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the business view I hear constantly, but we don't hear the citizen's 
view very often," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, lawyers for the firm planning to build a private golf resort on a 
sprawling hillside above the nearby community of Meiners Oaks still hold a 
grudge against the citizen activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some genuinely concerned people up there, but some of the activists 
would have us all living in tepees again," said Lindsay F. Nielson, who 
represents Farmont Corp., which wants to build the golf course. "They simply 
believe that any form of development is evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielson, a board member of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., called many of 
the activist efforts misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai does have a large number of people who are very environmentally in 
tune," he said. "But they aren't interested in what impact (a project) has on 
the economy of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a proposed university campus did not escape the purview of the ecological 
watchdogs. As soon as officials targeted Taylor Ranch, near California 33 and 
U.S. 101, for a state university, opponents concerned about air quality in the 
Ojai Valley went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were planning for 20,000 students," said Pat Baggerly, a Meiners Oaks 
resident and member of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County that 
opposed the site. "And all that (smog) blows up this way." 
</P>
<P>
 The campus is now being planned for a lemon grove outside Camarillo.

 Another element at work in Ojai is that many artisans and performers seeking 
refuge from Los Angeles have made the enclave home, propagating its reputation 
for eco-activism.

 Celebrity residents "do help draw attention from the media, and that tells 
people what's going on," said actor Larry Hagman, who owns a 30-acre spread 
atop Sulphur Mountain. "But I don't know that I've had that much impact."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA MOVES CITY HALL OFFICES TO NEW 
SITE; GOVERNMENT: A BUILDING IN SAUGUS BECOMES THE TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE 
CENTER WHILE THE BADLY DAMAGED CIVIC STRUCTURE IS REPAIRED.

<P>
 After operating out of tents and trailers in the parking lot of its 
quake-hammered headquarters for more than two weeks, the city of Santa Clarita 
on Monday began moving its offices to a temporary site in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, a building owned by Cytec Engineered Materials Inc., 21444 
Golden Triangle Road, will serve as the city's administrative center while 
repairs are made to City Hall, which suffered about $4 million in damages in 
the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs to the City Hall building at 23920 Valencia Blvd. are expected to take 
three months, and will include shoring up and seismically reinforcing the 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Lease terms are not yet complete for the city's temporary home, said Cytec 
plant manager Joe Sadera, but the city will pay only operational costs for the 
use of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a vacant building and the city needs a place to stay, so we're going 
to help them out," Sadera said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Finance Director Steve Stark said the new building was selected in part 
because it is large enough to house all city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way we can broadcast to the citizens, 'City Hall is now HERE,' instead 
of having things spread out all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stark said he will be relieved to move to more permanent quarters, he 
was surprised at how smoothly the city was able to operate under adverse 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's remarkable how well we've done outdoors," Stark said. "This tent has 
gone through an evolution from emergency response to disaster recovery." He 
said some recovery services -- such as building inspection requests -- would 
continue to be offered from the City Hall parking lot for at least the next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as there's a need, we'll be out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a second disaster assistance center opened Monday at the Saugus 
train station in Hart Park. Before then, residents of the Santa Clarita Valley 
in need of earthquake relief services had to go to Canyon Country Park in the 
city's northeastern corner.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DESERT GROUP JOINS FIGHT AGAINST 
HAZARDOUS-WASTE BURNING; 1ENVIRONMENT: ANTELOPE VALLEY ACTIVISTS ARE PART OF A 
NATIONWIDE COALITION TARGETING EIGHT SITES, INCLUDING A CEMENT PLANT NEAR 
GORMAN. 
</P>

<P>
 An Antelope Valley group joined a nationwide coalition of activists Monday in 
urging federal officials to halt the burning of hazardous waste at eight sites, 
including a Southern California cement plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Citizens Against Pollution was among 12 public health, environmental 
and waste-treatment groups that filed the petition in Washington, D. C. The 
document warned U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol 
Browner that the groups will file a lawsuit within 60 days unless she moves to 
halt the waste burning. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the eight sites targeted by the activists is the National Cement Co. 
plant just northeast of Gorman, near the Los Angeles-Kern county line. Members 
of Desert Citizens Against Pollution have alleged that the plant is releasing 
toxic air emissions that may be causing health problems among nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Lowrance, associate deputy administrator with the EPA in Washington, 
said the activists' petition "is very consistent with the administration's 
position about what we should be doing regarding cement kilns. . . . We are 
absolutely committed to going after these facilities when they cause some 
environmental problems." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the EPA is preparing to take action before the 60-day deadline 
against some firms that burn hazardous waste, but she did not know if National 
Cement would be among these. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement Monday, National Cement said it is legally permitted 
to burn hazardous waste-derived fuel. The firm said an independent study filed 
with the state "showed the facility to be operating well within federal and 
state health risk guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the EPA said it planned to deny National Cement a permit to 
continue burning hazardous waste because its application lacked a signature 
from Tejon Ranchcorp, which leases its land to the plant. The company can 
continue to burn waste until a final decision is handed down, probably in the 
spring, said Virginia Donohue, a spokeswoman for the EPA's regional office in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Tejon Ranchcorp's parent company is 30% owned by Times Mirror Co., which 
publishes the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 More coverage of the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys appears today on B8.

THE JOY OF CRYING; GO AHEAD, HAVE A BAWL. RESEARCHERS SAY TEARS ARE GOOD FOR 
YOU -- EVEN THOUGH CULTURAL MORES DISCOURAGE US FROM SHEDDING ANY. 
</P>

 Yesterday, my 4-year-old stopped crying. 
</P>
<P>
 He fell off his bike, held his breath and gritted his teeth. "I'm not gonna 
cry, Mom," he said. "I'm really not." 
</P>
<P>
 Where did this pint-size stoicism come from? Batman videos? Preschool 
name-callers? Maybe the neighbors who tell their kid, "Crying will get you 
nowhere." You hear it everywhere: You'd better not pout, you'd better not cry. 
Big girls don't cry. Grin and bear it, hide it, stifle it, but whatever you do, 
don't cry, please , don't cry. I'll give you a cookie if you stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffle .  
</P>
<P>
 So why am I upset? Because on some level I know that it's healthful to cry. It 
is, in the words of biochemist William H. Frey II, "a natural mechanism for 
adapting to emotional stress" -- a way of equalizing sadness, anger, fear, 
surprise, frustration or joy. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey, who has studied crying for 20 years, directs the Ramsey Clinic's Dry Eye 
and Tear Research Center in St. Paul, Minn. If he has found anything, it's that 
the chemistry of crying sets us right. Not doing it can literally make us sick. 
And my kid has just joined the roughly 25% of America that's not doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel like running after bike and child, yelling: "Go ahead and cryyyyyy!" 
Years from now, will my son end up in therapy, 12-Step meetings, encounter 
weekends or spiritual journeys, trying to crack open the reservoir? 
</P>
<P>
 Says Frey: "I get hundreds of letters from people who say, 'I wish I could 
learn to cry again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a nation, we're all mixed up about crying. Our children come into the world 
and -- slap, WAAAaaaa ! -- it's the only thing they know how to do. It ensures 
survival. Cry and get fed. Cry and get held. Cry and get loved. But then, the 
most basic of human utterances gets roped in by rules and prohibitions: 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffle at weddings and funerals, but don't wail. Cry at movies, but only 
silently, in the dark, facing forward, and be sure to stop before you hit the 
popcorn counter. If you cry at work, make sure it isn't in front of the boss or 
a client. Don't cry in front of a man if you're a woman, or a woman if you're a 
man, or a man if you're a man. No matter who or where you are, keep the runny 
nose in check. If you really want to make a good impression, don't cry at all. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a classic case of nature versus culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, if we were all like Robinson Crusoe, beyond the reach of civilization, 
we could wail at will and be healthier for it. But we're not. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone's crying, what do you do? Comfort them? Pity them? Avoid them?" 
asks Sonoma State University psychologist Carolyn Saarni, an expert in 
socialization of emotions. "It's uncomfortable. The impact on other people is 
huge." So we devise all sorts of ways for damming the emotional Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept holding on and telling myself, telling myself, 'Don't cry, don't cry, 
don't cry,' " says a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney, recalling an 
episode at her workplace. "We were deposing this woman who was a witness for 
the other side. I was technically the enemy. She was talking about this 
wonderful family with the mother who died of cancer. Finally, I sort of 
squeaked, 'No further questions.' I stared straight ahead, got in the elevator, 
into my car and drove off. As soon as I got to a stoplight, I cried like a 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My 4-year-old is playing with a friend who wags his finger when my son sheds 
tears over a lost new toy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You shouldn't cry," the friend says. "There are germs in your tears and 
they'll get on your face. They'll make you sick." 
</P>
<P>
 "They will not!" my son says, standing up to his challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask the friend where he heard about the germs. "From my mom." 
</P>
<P>
 So it begins. My child's natural urge is bent by others, what families, 
institutions and playground survival tactics dictate. Which wins out? How can 
you teach your kid to do the natural thing if it goes against the currents of 
the culture? Germs in the tears, boys who cry are sissies, girls who cry are 
manipulative, parents can't cry unless they want everyone to lose confidence in 
them, our leaders shouldn't unless they want a close-up on the nightly news. 
</P>
<P>
 Says behaviorist Saarni: "In our society, a person's identity is often defined 
by his or her dominant emotional state -- you are what you feel. We say, 'Oh, 
he's a very happy person' or 'She's cheerful. Or stoic.' Your emotional state 
gets turned into a personality trait." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone who cries, then, is weak. Not a trooper. Not the kind of Puritan who 
made it over on the Mayflower, colonized the wilderness and tamed the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We idealize the stoic," says Peg Crepeau, a Milwaukee psychotherapist who has 
revealed a connection between not crying and such stress diseases as ulcers and 
colitis. "We made a goddess out of Jackie Kennedy, this immovable object who 
never showed any emotion, who never once cried. We thought it was elegant and 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman in Crepeau's crying study, a psychiatrist in her 50s, kept a box of 
Kleenex in her office so her own patients could wipe their tears, but she 
hadn't cried herself since she was 13. The first time she remembers really 
crying, she was at the dentist. Her father told her that if she didn't stop, 
he'd yank every tooth out of her head. The next time, she was at the funeral of 
a grandfather she adored. Her father told her that if she didn't stop 
embarrassing the family like that, she'd have to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never cried again," Crepeau says. By the time she was 50, she had 
ulcerative colitis. And maybe more. 
</P>
<P>
 People who can't cry "lose their connections to what they feel -- to intimate 
relationships, to nature and the environment, the healthy part of the self and 
the world," says Don Elium, a Contra Costa County family counselor who has 
developed a way to help people with post-traumatic stress learn to cry. Holding 
back becomes a force unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Says biochemist Frey: "The James Bond image of having to be in control all the 
time has serious consequences for the individual and the society." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet crying has always kept people healthy, behaviorists say. The original 
ability to vocalize distress helped early mammals protect their young and to 
communicate danger, fear and helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were social signals . . . with tremendous survival value," says Columbia 
University psychiatrist Myron Hofer, who has studied vocalizations in rats. 
Survival favored the fittest: the criers. Evolution gave people tears to help 
cleanse the distress, a function Frey believes separates humans from other 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time American culture came along, social evolution brought a new 
recipe for survival. If you want to do the dinner party, learn to use the crab 
fork. If you want to be a trooper, get back in the saddle with a wound to the 
chest, hurting, but heroic. Like my kid on his bike. So should he cry or not 
cry? The question evokes two warring veins of thought predating the time the 
New Testament told us that Jesus wept: the ethic of self-expressiveness and the 
ethic of self-control. 
</P>
<P>
 The first gave us Athens. Aristotle. Thomas Jefferson. Compassion. The flow. 
Keening at the wake. Wringing out the highs and lows through the tears -- like 
my son's Irish grandfather, who weeps over a dead beetle in the weed patch. The 
second brought us Sparta. Plato. Alexander Hamilton. Order. The emotional dam. 
Stiffening the upper lip. Holding it in for social tidiness -- like the mother 
of the kid with the germs in the tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's evidence that crying isn't voluntary," Frey says. "A few people can 
turn it on and off at will. But for most people, it's, 'Uh-oh, I'm crying.' " 
Which is just fine if you live in a culture where crying is not only OK, but 
encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many cultures, crying is a way of showing cohesion," psychologist Saarni 
says. "With Mediterranean peoples, for example, it isn't a sign of weakness or 
dependency. It is met with admiration. If there's some big disaster in a Greek 
village, everyone, the men included, is out there crying and carrying on. It's 
a collective catharsis." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychotherapist Crepeau points out that Irish, Jewish and African American 
cultures -- "peoples who historically have suffered grievously" -- tend to 
embrace crying and, at the same time, are celebrated for their humor. 
</P>
<P>
 But in mainstream America, the "Uh-oh, I'm crying" sets off the alarm. Here we 
go. If the floodgates open, the unsightly gulping and sobbing can't be far 
behind, and then, sin of cultural sins, you're out of control.  
</P>
<P>
 "I spend a lot of energy trying not to cry," says one woman who several years 
ago wept for weeks when her mother was dying. "It's like a Pandora's box. Once 
you open it up, you can never close it. Once it happens, you're no longer 
crying tears -- they're crying you." 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to the tears when they don't get cried? 
</P>
<P>
 "An important part of us literally goes underground," says Bruce Silverman, a 
Berkeley men's group counselor. "You can't believe what's it like to see a very 
successful middle-aged man who doesn't know how to cry, sitting there, 
struggling to be human." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's evidence that our 400-year Puritan dry spell may be coming to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our attitude is improving, but only slowly," Frey says. Small signs: the 
current wave of tear-jerker movies. The maturing thirtysomething generation, 
raised on therapy and human potential. The President of the United States, who 
cried and didn't try to hide it. Norman Schwarzkopf, who said he wouldn't trust 
a man who couldn't cry at the battlefront. Even Clint Eastwood, who won an 
Academy Award for showing that gunslingers had emotions. The shift is subtle, 
but inexorable. 
</P>
<P>
 And the kid with the germs in the tears? This morning his bike went off the 
sidewalk and spilled him onto the road. He wailed. My son ran to his friend's 
rescue, held his breath and gritted his teeth. His lip quivered. His eyes 
brimmed. The dam burst.

THE JOY OF CRYING

<P>
 At the Ramsey Clinic's Dry Eye and Tear Research Center in St. Paul, Minn., 
William H. Frey II studies the biochemistry of emotional tears, hoping to 
quantify the human mystery of crying. His findings: There's a huge gender gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys and girls up to age 12 cry with the same frequency, but afterward, girls 
cry more. After age 18, women cry almost four times as frequently as men. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a certain age, boys learn to disengage," Frey says. But he believes that 
there's a biological basis as well. Emotional tears contain the hormone 
prolactin, which aids milk production and is released in response to stress in 
both men and women. By age 18, women have 60% more prolactin in their blood 
than men.  
</P>
<P>
 In his studies, Frey found: 
</P>
<P>
 * Women cried an average 5.3 times a month; men, 1.4 times a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women (85%) and men (73%) said they felt better after crying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Men (71%) reported "watery eyes only" and women (47%) reported "flowing 
tears." 
</P>
<P>
 * Women (6%) and men (45%) said they didn't cry at all. MARY ANN HOGAN

FOR NOW, AT LEAST, L.A. IS THE EPICENTER OF GOOD DEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We were begged to make love, not war. That made a lot of babies but didn't do 
much to keep us out of Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we were offered a kinder, gentler nation, brightened by a thousand points 
of light. It went dark after one term. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we're into random acts of senseless kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the blissful, altruistic, current message of four books, several 
thousand T-shirts, bumper stickers on Kern County sheriff's vehicles and a 
rediscovered Gospel according to neighborhood pulpits. 
</P>
<P>
 What stirred a year ago as an essay assignment at a community college is 
bringing a mountain of mail from Europe and Asia, adoption by "The Crusaders" 
television news magazine and a rising domestic challenge: If disease can be 
eased by a Great American Smokeout, why not try dimming violence with a World 
Kindness Day? 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the violence was Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 And the goodness and benefaction that broke out certainly has tempered the 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons and Hughes markets gave away food and an elderly woman continues to hunt 
the west Valley's runaway dogs with cans of Alpo. An attorney carried 200 Big 
Macs to Balboa Park and a convoy came to our tent cities from St. Mary's Food 
Bank in Phoenix. A California National Guardsman played his harmonica for a 
cluster of cold children, and a woman from El Salvador cried in the night. In 
her country, she says, soldiers aren't friends of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 For a glowing moment, Los Angeles was the epicenter of Good Samaritanism. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chuck Wall is delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a Bakersfield College human relations instructor and the accidental guru 
of it all. Last year, Wall, 53, was thoroughly dismayed by a persistent, banal 
cliche of radio news: "We have another random act of senseless violence to 
report." 
</P>
<P>
 He mentally edited the phrase, substituting kindness for violence . 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Wall says, he had "a great phrase that turned a negative into a 
positive." Which he turned into an assignment, challenging his class to 
perform, then write about, their own acts of senseless kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 In almost immediate concert, a world of nervous youngsters, angry parents, 
jaded cops, worried clergy and frustrated politicians began clutching at Wall's 
alternative to human disregard and rudeness -- this tiny opportunity to tug 
America from its bad mood. 
</P>
<P>
 It is fitting that Wall was contacted last week by four San Fernando Valley 
schools wanting to start their own kindness crusades. They know it will aid 
communities and help heal students. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more appropriate was that volunteers moving among earthquake victims 
included a team from the Bakersfield Family Medical Center. Wall disciples all, 
their T-shirts asked: "Today, I Will Commit One Random Act of Senseless 
Kindness . . . Will You?" 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred thousand Los Angeles residents have no need to respond. They 
are two weeks into doing whatever they can, whenever asked and mostly without 
being asked. And their acts are far from random. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Carlisle, 66, a Korean War veteran and West Pointer, is a sick man. He 
has suspended renal failure and his life sentence is three home dialysis 
treatments each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlisle knew exactly what he needed to do between sessions of cleansing his 
own blood. While the earthquake still grumbled, he drove to the Wilshire 
Dialysis Center and answered the phone, got the door and eased the discomfort 
of other kidney patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would he do that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why wouldn't I?" he responds. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Molina, a Woodland Hills publicist, felt obligated to kindness by a gift. 
When he bought ice and emergency supplies at a Ventura Boulevard liquor store, 
a clerk wouldn't charge him for candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina duplicated the kindness. He drove to Chatsworth to check on friends and 
employees, ran their errands and invited a dozen to a party at his own cracked 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my Quake Wake, a barbecue with champagne and caviar because being 
extravagant amagnified the pick-me-up," he says. "I saw acts of kindness 
everywhere. . . . Unlike other times in my city, this time the only thing that 
was bad news was the quake, not the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Times reporter Rich Connell could have declined involvement by pleading 
professional objectivity. But he spent a night in a shelter at Van Nuys High 
School for one story and was moved by the dedication of volunteer nurses trying 
to calm crying babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a point where you say: 'All these people want is a couple of rocking 
chairs,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell posted an appeal on a city room notice board. He has been given two 
rockers with promises of more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake reduced Beaver's Den -- Sandra Beaver's antique store in 
Tarzana -- to three trash containers of broken glass and china. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rang at the height of her misery. It was a wrong number, a woman 
calling from New Jersey and failing in a frantic search for word of an elderly 
relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaver calmed her, took the Valley number and was able to contact the unharmed 
relative. Then she called New Jersey with the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would I have done that before the earthquake, before my customers called to 
see if we were OK and could they come down and help?" she says. "Probably not." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, maybe, kindness has a shelf life and random acts will diminish with the 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 When walls are no longer tumbling down, when damage is repaired and no longer 
a reminder, will we revert to cutting in and flipping off and barging through 
our daily encounters? 
</P>
<P>
 Wall thinks not.

 He says there's just too much attention being paid to the idea for it to be a 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere you look, everything you read, everyone you talk to is saying 
they've had it with violence and that there must be a better way to live," Wall 
says. "And kindness is a better way." 
</P>
<P>
 But how can this ideal succeed when most other dreams have sputtered? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there are no special-interest groups involved and kindness is not a 
political statement," he says. "No famous people are involved, you don't have 
to spend money on it, it requires no physical effort and political correctness 
certainly isn't part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Random acts of senseless kindness is just Heartland America."

PERSONAL HEALTH; GOOD FRIENDS CAN KEEP YOU HEALTHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An active social life may be good for your health, researchers have long 
suggested. A new study lends weight to that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 People who maintain satisfying relationships with a mate, friend or fellow 
member of a club are less likely to smoke or drink heavily and more likely to 
wear seat belts, says Clifford Broman, a Michigan State University sociologist 
who analyzed data from the government's National Survey of Personal Health 
Practices and Consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee-employer relationship had limited effects on health behavior, he 
found, and those effects are often negative. 
</P>
<P>
 When an important social relationship is lost, good health habits tend to 
decline, at least temporarily, Broman's analysis shows. The loss of a marital 
relationship, for instance, often resulted in heavier smoking among the survey 
sample. This might be a "grief reaction," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 How to explain the link between good social relationships and good health 
habits? 
</P>
<P>
 "Those with social relationships may feel a sense of responsibility to people 
(they are involved with), inspiring them to self-regulate their behavior," 
speculates Broman, whose findings were published in the Journal of Behavioral 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he adds, people with meaningful social relationships might 
just be the types "who take to heart messages about good health practices."

HEALTH WATCH; ADVANCES OFFER HOPE FOR ELIMINATING ARTHRITIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthritis, which has afflicted humankind since antiquity, may be eliminated in 
the next few decades, according to a researcher for the Arthritis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this decade, we will see a whole range of new arthritis treatments being 
developed," says Dr. Brian Butcher, group vice president of research for the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "And each day, researchers are one small step closer to finding cures and 
preventions for arthritis diseases." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past few months, there have been several important research 
advances, including the discovery of an antibody treatment that blocks the 
effects of inflammatory arthritis.

 Walk, Don't Run: Not sure how to walk? Here, the three stages of "Bodywalk," a 
method devised by Reebok, a fitness walker and researchers at San Diego State 
University: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technique 1: Easy walking (16-minute mile or slower) with focus on posture. 
The head should be up, the shoulders back and down, the chest up to avoid 
hunched posture that is less mechanically efficient. Abdominal muscles should 
be tucked in to support the lower back. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technique 2: Faster (13- to 15-minute mile), with arms at 90-degree angles 
and pumping forward and back (not side to side); according to the Reebok 
program, this helps the walker proceed at a faster pace. Forearms should be 
kept toward the front of the body and palms should not swing past the hips or 
above the sternum. Walker should roll all the way through the foot, from the 
heel that is planted to the ball of the foot and toes that launch the walker 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technique 3: Fastest (12-minute mile and faster), with hips moving back and 
forth to accommodate quicker, shorter steps, placing one foot in front of the 
other.

MARKETING: TRAVEL ADS TRY THE HEART SELL; MADISON AVE. USES ROMANCE TO 
REVITALIZE THE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not just the "Love Boat" anymore. Here comes the Love Train -- and other 
more sensual lures for travelers -- courtesy of Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The usually conservative Amtrak has just unwrapped an unexpectedly flashy 
print ad campaign that poses the rather racy question "Can a Train Holiday 
Improve Your Love Life?" A train trip, the ad vows, "will send your love life 
into orbit." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a new TV spot for Norwegian Cruise Line takes cruise 
advertising to unprecedented levels of sexual explicitness. One Norwegian ad 
was so sexual in nature that censors at NBC ordered the ad modified before 
airing it during Sunday's Super Bowl game. "There is no law that says you can't 
make love at four in the afternoon on a Tuesday," the ad says. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel marketers are taking sensuality to sea -- and even chugging it along 
train tracks. As the nation's travel industry tries to recover from several 
consecutive years of disappointing growth, some of the country's biggest travel 
companies are hopeful that ads promising a tryst or two will send consumers 
scurrying to their travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their blatant sensuality, the new ads generally are not seen as 
sexist, because they tend to treat men and women on equal terms and as equally 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody dreams about making it in one of those sleeper berths," said 
Allison Cohen, president of the New York-based ad consulting firm PeopleTalk. 
"We're talking about the kind of old-fashioned romance that used to be 
associated with travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Travel marketers are getting wise to the secret desires of travelers -- 
including those of many middle-aged couples. "There is a big market out there 
saying, 'We need to get away and refresh our marriage,"' said JeraldJellisona 
Los Angeles psychiatrist and consultant. "Most people hope their love lives 
will improve when they step away from everything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Romance is an excellent marketing hook," added Roberta Clarke, professor of 
marketing at Boston University. In a tough economy, travel companies that can't 
claim to be the lowest-priced need some other very attractive promise, she 
said. "So why not romance?" 
</P>
<P>
 The number of trips taken by Americans was up less than 3% in 1993 compared to 
1992, reports the Washington-based Travel Industry Assn. of America. That's 
less than half the annual growth the industry was enjoying just a handful of 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one reason why travel ads with sensual themes are likely to continue 
for some time, said Edward Book, president of the travel association. "They are 
trying to appeal to baby boomers who are moving into their late 40s and 50s," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That accurately describes the middle-aged couple in the Amtrak ad, seen 
hugging in the aisle of the train. Says the ad: "A train trip is like one long, 
fascinating date." 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak officials want to see ridership -- especially among the middle-aged -- 
pick up from its current slow pace. Ridership was up only slightly in 1993 
compared to 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 "Train travel is a way to get away from it all," said Joan Wheatley, director 
of advertising for Amtrak. "If people care for each other, a train trip can 
become a very romantic experience." 
</P>
<P>
 How romantic? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the New York ad agency that created the print ad first talked to a 
number of train passengers. "People tell us there's something very sexy about 
trains," said Damion O'Malley, executive vice president of DDB Needham. "It 
throws you together for hours on end. There's an air of, well, anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But romantic travel may be most commonly associated with cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
 That theme was picked up eight years ago by Princess Cruise Line, whose ship 
was used as a backdrop on the popular "Love Boat" TV series. Each weekly show 
usually featured a heated romance. Now the cruise line calls all of its ships 
"Love Boats." Its TV spots star Gavin MacLeod, who played the ship's captain on 
the show. The ads also use the show's theme song. 
</P>
<P>
 "We research this every year," said Julie Benson, director of public relations 
for Princess. "Consumers keep telling us that the 'Love Boat' has a lot of 
positive associations. So we stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The current TV and print ads for Norwegian Cruises make the "Love Boat" look 
tame. One print ad features a photo of a woman's bare back in a waterfall. "I 
will be naked more," she says in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that people go on vacations to renew relationships," said Jeff 
Stutin, marketing director for Norwegian. "We're just bringing that to the 
forefront." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a bit too much so -- at least in the eyes of NBC censors. Prior to 
airing a Norwegian TV spot during Sunday's Super Bowl, NBC told Norwegian's ad 
agency to modify one part of the ad that shows a woman caressing a man's chest. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "The ad is tame compared to some of the shots the network aired of the Dallas 
Cowgirls cheerleaders," said Jeffrey Goodby, co-chairman of the San Francisco 
ad agency Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most airlines have been careful to stay away from sensuality in advertising. 
The one exception is Singapore Airlines, which 22 years ago introduced the 
notion of air travel as a service in which its attendants are at the customer's 
beck and call. About 70% of the airline's passengers are males. 
</P>
<P>
 Its ads feature real flight attendants who are referred to as "Singapore 
Girls." And while Singapore Airlines also has several thousand male flight 
attendants, it has never so much as mentioned them in its ads. "We've spent 
millions on this successful campaign," said Teng Aun Hwang, senior vice 
president at Singapore. "Why change it if we don't need to?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ads have been criticized as sexist and exploitative, the 
Singapore Airlines executive insists there is no subliminal message of 
sexuality in the "Singapore Girl" ads. "These are our own employees," he said. 
"We would never treat them in any way other than a wholesome and respectful 
manner." Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Lord, Dentsu & Partners has picked up the $15-million AST 
Research account formerly handled by Team One Advertising of El Segundo. . . . 
Torrance-based Saatchi & Saatchi/Pacific has picked up the $10-million 
corporate account for Cypress-based Secure Horizons. . . . Anaheim-based Hansen 
Beverage Co. has narrowed its $2-million account review to five area ad shops. 
. . . Los Angeles-based Dailey & Associates has resigned the estimated 
$1-million Asiana Airlines account. . . . Los Angeles-based First Interstate 
Bank has handed its $25-million ad business to San Francisco-based Hal Riney & 
Partners. It was formerly handled by Los Angeles-based Campbell & Wagman. . . . 
Venice-based Chiat/Day has picked up the estimated $10-million PacTel Cellular 
account.

ROVER, BRITAIN'S LAST AUTO GIANT, GOING TO BMW; MERGERS: THE $1.2-BILLION DEAL 
IS CRITICIZED BY 20% SHAREHOLDER HONDA AS A THREAT TO THE FIRM'S 'BRITISHNESS 
AND ROVERNESS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rover car company, Britain's last major auto maker, announced Monday that 
it is being sold to Germany's BMW for $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale by British Aerospace, which owns 80% of Rover's stock, is expected to 
allow Rover to expand its markets, selling its cars through BMW outlets in the 
United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the deal was criticized by Japanese auto maker Honda, which has a 20% 
stake in Rover and helped transform the company by revamping its product range 
and introducing modern cost-cutting practices on the assembly line. While Honda 
will keep its stake, the long-term future of its collaboration with Rover is in 
doubt, industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been cooperating with Rover for 15 years with the aim of maintaining 
the Britishness and Roverness of the indigenous British company," a Honda 
spokesman in Tokyo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise sale "negates Honda's and Rover's long-term efforts to establish 
a firm future for Rover as a British company with its own brand identity," 
Honda President Nobuhiko Kawamoto said. "Honda has always felt that a key to 
the success of this partnership was Rover's independence." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which must be approved by British Aerospace stockholders and 
government regulators, is also expected to draw criticism from British 
government opponents. They claimed that the sale of Rover to British Aerospace 
in 1988, when Rover was a nationalized company, was at a much undervalued 
price, costing taxpayers millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares in British Aerospace soared Monday as financial experts said the sale 
price was much higher than had been expected and partly explained why British 
Aerospace decided to unload. 
</P>
<P>
 Rover ran up losses of $13.5 million last year but was expected to rebound 
sharply this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale in effect means the end of a British-owned volume car industry. With 
Jaguar sold to Ford Motor Co. nearly five years ago, Rolls-Royce is the only of 
the great names of British motoring history that still remains in British 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 BMW will acquire Rover with its debts and pay in two installments: $840 
million on the sale completion and $360 million on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 In Munich, BMW Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder said: "The Rover and BMW model 
ranges complement each other. In addition, our differing regional strengths 
provide a powerful synergy." 
</P>
<P>
 In the sale, British Aerospace agreed to deliver all the trademark names of 
the line: Rover, Land Rover, MG, Triumph and Austin. Rover was the latest name 
for the company that during this century has produced such British classics as 
Wolesley, Riley, Austin Seven, Morris Oxford and Morris Minor. Later came the 
famed Mini, the Rover 2000, the Metro and the latest flag-carrier, the Rover 
800.

CHARGES FILED AGAINST BLOCKBUSTER OVER VIDEOTAPE REBATE OFFER; CONSUMERS: 
COMPANY ALLEGEDLY FAILED TO MENTION CONTINGENCY IN PROMOTION INVOLVING 'BEAUTY 
AND THE BEAST' AND OTHER FILMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Blockbuster Video on Monday was charged with false and misleading advertising 
in connection with a popular rebate offer for "Beauty and the Beast" and 24 
other video titles during December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed by the state attorney general's office and the Monterey County 
district attorney's office, alleges that the nation's largest video retailer 
violated California law when it failed to state in its advertising that a $5 
rebate on the video titles was contingent on buying other products, ranging 
from crackers and cookies to detergent and cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers discovered they had to buy additional merchandise to get the rebate 
only after they had purchased a video and read the rebate instructions that 
came with it, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace W. Knief, a spokesman for Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based Blockbuster 
Entertainment Corp., which operates the stores, said the company hadn't 
received a copy of the suit and doesn't comment on litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office said at least 33,000 Californians who purchased 
the video titles may have been misled. The state is seeking monetary penalties 
against Blockbuster and restitution to consumers allegedly duped by the rebate 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have argued that it is not a violation," said Herschel Elkins, senior 
assistant attorney general. "To us, it appears a clear violation." 
</P>
<P>
 Elkins said Blockbuster advertised the rebate offer in newspaper inserts and 
on posters in its video stores. The promotions said a $5 rebate was available, 
but did not tell consumers how to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertised price of "Beauty and the Beast," among the best-selling video 
titles ever, was $8.95 -- after the $5 rebate and a $3 rental coupon. Consumers 
who purchased "Beauty and the Beast" found out after opening it that in order 
to get the rebate they had to purchase four boxes of Nabisco crackers and mail 
in the receipt for the crackers and the videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers who purchased "Batman Returns" had to purchase All detergent to get 
a $5 rebate. Other titles in the promotion included "Hook," "101 Dalmations" 
and a Cindy Crawford workout tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies that make the crackers, detergent and other products were not 
named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Monterey County Superior Court, said the advertised 
"after-rebate" price for the videos was misleading because consumers were 
required to spend more money to get the rebate. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit said that consumers were required to make the additional purchases in 
a very short time. The promotion started on Nov. 26, 1992, and receipts for the 
video and the additional merchandise had to be dated no later than Dec. 31, 
1992, a condition stated only on the rebate instructions that came with the 
video. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who bought the video at the end of the sale would have to run out that 
day and buy crackers to get the rebate," said Lydia Villarreal, deputy district 
attorney in Monterey County. "A lot of people probably just crumpled up the 
paper and threw it away."

DOW INDEX POISED TO TOP 4,000 AS OPTIMISM SPURS 33-POINT GAIN; MARKETS: 
ANALYSTS ALSO CREDIT SURGE IN JAPAN'S NIKKEI AVERAGE WITH DRIVING U.S. STOCKS 
TO A THIRD STRAIGHT RECORD HIGH.

<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average and other major market indexes surged to 
record highs Monday on strength in foreign markets and general optimism about 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's sharp advance, which put it within striking distance of the 
benchmark 4,000 level, was led by stocks of cyclical companies that benefit 
most from an expanding economy such as autos, heavy machinery and mining. On 
Friday, a government reading on the economy showed strong growth and low 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow set its third consecutive record, rising 32.93 points to 3,978.36, 
eclipsing its previous high of 3,945.43 set Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, long-term interest rates rose despite initially holding 
steady on suggestions from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that 
inflation remains under control for now. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume rose to 322.87 million shares, up from 313.14 million in the 
previous session. January was the busiest month on record for the exchange, 
with total share volume of about 6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The market started the day strong, following stock prices overseas, and never 
looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese stocks surged 7.8%, while rallies took key indexes in Mexico City, 
London and Paris to record high closes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei stock average soared 1,471.24 to 20,229.12, a 
three-month high, after the weekend approval of political reform plans by 
Japan's Parliament.  
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index ended 38.17 points higher at 2,781.37. In Frankfurt, 
the DAX 30-share average closed at 2,177.45 up 43.98 points, while London's 
Financial Times 100-share average closed at 3,491.8, up 44.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story of the day is Japan, and that's what's moving our market," said 
James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said Greenspan's comments to Congress that inflation may be lower than 
actually reported gave further confidence that the low-interest-rate 
environment is likely to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 The market paid little attention to Greenspan's main message that short-term 
interest rates are "abnormally low" and are likely to be moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
 While some interpreted Greenspan's testimony to mean a rise in short-term 
interest rates could come in six months, others said they thought the remarks 
meant that long-term rates could be moving lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, analysts said Monday's reading on the economy had little impact on 
stocks. The Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal income rose 
0.6% in December. Private economists had expected a 0.5% rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's 500, New York Stock Exchange Composite and Nasdaq 
Composite indexes also wound up in record territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq index rose 3.94 to a record 800.47, eclipsing the record high of 
796.53 reached Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 So-called cyclical stocks rose sharply. General Motors climbed 2 to 61 1/4, 
Ford gained 1 3/4 to 67, Chrysler added 1 5/8 to 61 1/2, Deere jumped 2 5/8 to

 Bond market analysts traced part of the rise in government bond yields to a 
wave of corporate borrowing, including a $1-billion deal from the Canadian 
province of Quebec. As part of corporate bond transactions, underwriters 
typically sell Treasury securities as a way to hedge against potential losses.

 Monday's sales were the first in a flood of expected corporate borrowing by 
foreign countries in the U.S. market this week.

 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield rose 6.23% from Friday's 6.21%. Its 
price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 5/16 point, or $3.13 per

</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, comments by Greenspan would drive bond prices lower. Higher rates 
on new securities devalue already-sold bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists expect the Fed at some point to nudge up rates to curb the 
threat of rising prices as the economy continues to grow. But bond prices edged 
higher as investors apparently focused on Greenspan's failure to offer a 
specific timetable for taking action.

SPOTLIGHT ON QVC'S DILLER AT DEADLINE TIME ON PARAMOUNT; MEDIA: SHOPPING 
NETWORK AND RIVAL SUITOR VIACOM ARE EXPECTED TO AGAIN RAISE THE ANTE FOR THE 
STUDIO AT THE 11TH HOUR. 
</P>

<P>
 With final bids for Paramount Communications Inc. due today, QVC Network Inc. 
Chairman Barry Diller practiced brinkmanship Monday by leaving his 5-week-old 
bid unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 By holding off, Diller ran the risk of losing Paramount had a majority of 
shareholders tendered their stock to archrival Viacom Inc. by 9 p.m. PST, when 
that company's cash-rich offer was set to expire. In effect, Diller called the 
bluff of Wall Street speculators who had threatened to tender their stock to 
Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street sources said he made a fairly safe bet, since most 
stockholders are likely to sit tight until after 2 p.m. PST today, the final 
deadline for both sides to submit revised bids. QVC and Viacom are expected to 
raise the ante, although neither side knows what the other will do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has got to bid blind," according to one investment banker involved. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50% of Paramount's stock is now believed to be in the hands of 
arbitragers, while more cautious institutional investors have reduced their 
Paramount holdings. In an informal survey, arbitragers said Monday that they 
had no intention of tendering their shares as long as there was a chance of 
improved offers from both QVC and Viacom. "If I were an arbitrager, I'd do the 
same damn thing," acknowledged one investment banker involved in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Under rules adopted by the Paramount board, the five-month contest should be 
drawing to a close with final bids due today. If changes are made in the 
existing tender offers, the expiration date will be extended 10 business days. 
Under the auction rules, the outcome will be determined when 50.1% of 
Paramount's shares are tendered to one of the two suitors. 
</P>
<P>
 During the battle, both QVC and Viacom have altered the mix of cash and 
securities they have offered to Paramount shareholders in their two-tier tender 
offers. Depending on the daily fluctuation of their stocks, the so-called 
blended value of the bids has varied accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of trading Monday, Viacom valued its bid at about $81 per share, 
while QVC's was worth about $85.50 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 But Viacom won the endorsement of the Paramount board 10 days ago because it 
boosted the cash component of its bid to $107 per share and promised Paramount 
shareholders some restitution if Viacom shares plummeted in value. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, QVC has been expected to offer some similar guarantee for the 
value of its own securities -- and possibly more cash. QVC is currently 
offering $92 per share for 50.1% of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion varied Monday on just how much Viacom or QVC would be willing to raise 
its bid. One investment banker said he expects the blended value of the offers 
to rise to a range of $85 to $88 for each share of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 One source in the Viacom camp scoffed at such predictions. "I don't think 
either side is going to do much, if anything," the executive said. "It's all 
about shoring up value, as opposed to giving more." 
</P>
<P>
 But another executive close to Viacom said, "I've got a feeling (Viacom 
Chairman Sumner Redstone) is going to go in again" with an improved bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Intending to make the deadline stick, Paramount issued a warning last week 
that it "fully intends" to hold to the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In trading Monday, Paramount closed at $79.625, down 25 cents, while QVC added 
25 cents to close at $44. Viacom A shares were unchanged at $39.50, while 
Viacom B shares fell 75 cents to close at $35.25.

 Xerox Reports Loss of $577 Million: The company said the fourth-quarter loss 
was due chiefly to costs associated with its previously announced plan to 
eliminate 10,000 jobs.It set aside $813 million after taxes to cover severance 
and other costs in its document-processing business. The restructuring should 
yield pretax savings of $350 million in 1994, Chief Executive Paul A. Allaire 
said. The company's stock jumped $5.50 to $98.125 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. The loss amounted to $5.63 a share and compares to a loss of $736 
million, or $7.80 per share, during the fourth quarter of 1992. Revenue was 
$4.18 billion, down 1% from $4.23 billion a year earlier.

 Rates Rise on T-Bills: The Treasury Department sold $12.6 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 2.99%, up from 2.96% last 
week. Another $12.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 3.16%, up from 3.14% last week.The three-month bill rate was 
the highest since they sold for 3.02% on Jan. 10. The six-month bill rate was 
the highest since they averaged 3.18%, also on Jan. 10. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors -- 3.06% for three-month bills with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,924.40 and 3.26% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,840.20. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill Auction:

 Treasury Expected to Borrow $45 Billion: The Treasury will announce Wednesday 
how it will sell the debt for the January-March quarter, including the makeup 
of refinancing auctions to sell three- and 10-year notes and 30-year 
bonds.Borrowing projection for the current quarter, which assumed a $20-billion 
cash balance on March 31, is $15 billion to $20 billion less than the 
Treasury's Nov. 1 estimate. The earlier figure assumed a $35-billion cash 
balance on March 31. The Treasury estimated that for the April-June quarter it 
will borrow $15 billion to $20 billion.

TEMPORARY HALT IS CALLED ON THE MERGERS OF MUTUAL S&LS; THRIFTS: THE MORATORIUM 
IS CALLED A GOOD FIRST STEP TO PROTECT DEPOSITORS WHEN THE INSTITUTIONS ARE 
ACQUIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a crackdown on windfall profits for some insiders, federal regulators 
imposed a moratorium Monday on mergers in which the stock of a depositor-owned 
savings and loan institutions is sold to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by the Office of Thrift Supervision was welcomed by Rep. Henry B. 
Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee. The Texas Democrat said it 
is a good first step to protect depositors when so-called mutual S&Ls are 
acquired by other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In calling a temporary halt to the merger activity, the OTS said it also 
intends to review standard conversions in which mutual S&Ls decide on their own 
to offer stock to the public. The agency said it will continue to process 
applications for standard conversions during the review. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud the OTS for its decision today to impose a moratorium on merger 
conversions, which are the most egregious type of conversion because the 
depositors . . . are not always able to purchase the savings bank stock, 
whereas the bank insiders always go home with their pockets lined," Gonzalez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to impose a similar temporary ban 
on merger conversions for mutual S&Ls. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC and OTS share responsibility for regulating the savings industry. 
</P>
<P>
 At a House banking subcommittee hearing last week, several lawmakers expressed 
concern that some insiders are getting rich in the deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting FDIC Chairman Andrew Hove promised the panel it will examine the 
conversions more closely. He said the agency is considering requiring special 
vouchers be issued to depositors when mutual savings institutions sell stock. 
The vouchers would let the holders buy stock, or they could be sold by 
depositors who so choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting OTS director Jonathan Fiechter said the moratorium will remain in 
effect until the agency drafts rules to protect depositors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual S&Ls have $250 billion in assets, about a fourth of the nation's 
savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 112 mutual S&Ls converted to publicly owned stock -- including 29 
that were bought by banks, industry groups reported. 
</P>
<P>
 OTS said managers of mutual thrift institutions often get lavish stock options 
and retirement pay when the S&Ls merge. It also said, acquiring banks can reap 
big profits by purchasing the mutual at a steep discount from its market value.

PACTEL THREATENS SUIT OVER FCC AWARDS; TECHNOLOGY: IT SAYS RIVALS WHO RECEIVED 
PCS LICENSES MAY HAVE BROKEN THE RULES THROUGH REPEATED CONTACT WITH THE 
AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Federal Communications Commission last year invited comment on rules 
to establish a new technology called wireless personal communications services, 
Pacific Telesis discovered that some of its competitors seemed especially eager 
to offer advice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two months leading up to a Dec. 23 decision awarding free franchises 
for the new technology, officials of two of the three winning firms were 
repeatedly in touch with the FCC, in possible violation of rules, PacTel 
complained last week. 
</P>
<P>
 PacTel, whose cellular phone business is threatened by the new PCS technology, 
called for a review and threatened to sue to overturn the award -- one of 
numerous challenges considered likely as this summer's high-stakes auction of 
further PCS franchises draws near. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the so-called pioneer's preference rule, by which those deemed to 
be technological leaders in a field are awarded free franchises while others 
must bid huge sums at an auction -- $250 million or more in the case of PCS. 
</P>
<P>
 The potentially lucrative franchises will launch businesses in a technology 
that will enable the transmission of voice, data and video communications via 
wireless transceivers that experts say will eventually be as portable and 
unobtrusive as a wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC voted last week to uphold the pioneer's preference rule. But 
Commissioner Ervin S. Duggan issued a statement warning of the policy's 
"potential dangers." He said those include "politicizing" the awards, 
difficulty in determining "what constitutes true innovation" and "being caught 
up in endless litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 PacTel complained that American Personal Communications of Washington huddled 
with FCC officials 25 times before winning a free franchise and that another 
firm, little Omnipoint Communications of Colorado Springs, Colo., contacted the 
FCC 11 times. 
</P>
<P>
 The contacts were permissible as long as they were limited to discussions 
about PCS technology. But in a five-page letter to the FCC on Friday, Pacific 
Telesis alleged that the discussions may have been aimed at influencing more 
important rule-making the FCC was undertaking at the time: a review of 
pioneer's preference rules themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three recipients of (PCS) awards . . . all made ex parte contacts" with 
the FCC, Michael K. Kellogg, a lawyer for Pacific Telesis, wrote in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the FCC had previously warned that failure to comply with its ex 
parte rules "could result in . . . (the) imposition of sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 concerns sought recognition for inventing PCS technology, but 
only three -- Omnipoint, American Personal Communications and Cox Enterprises 
of Atlanta -- received free licenses to provide PCS in Southern California and 
metropolitan New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Cox could not be reached. But American Personal Communications 
dismissed the allegation of improper FCC contact as "groundless," and Omnipoint 
President Douglas Smith said an overwhelming number of those who commented on 
the pioneer's preference rule supported Omnipoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not violate any ex parte rules, " said Smith, whose company employs 
about 100 people. "The fact that Pacific Telesis is bringing up an unfounded 
technicality as their objection shows you how weak their case is." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some critics say the PCS awards are less a reflection of the companies' 
inventiveness than of their influence in persuading FCC officials that they 
deserve credit for pioneering a technology that was being worked on by a host 
of firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also say the free licenses give the companies a huge competitive 
advantage over other firms that are expected to pay upward of $250 million each 
for similar licenses to operate on the public airwaves.  
</P>
<P>
 "This pioneer's preference is a stupid policy. The government doesn't go 
around setting aside oil leases for people who come up with an innovative way 
to drill for oil," said former FCC general counsel Henry Geller, who is now a 
private Washington communications lawyer for public interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Geller crusaded for such free awards when he worked for the FCC, but he now 
says his previous position was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the outcome the FCC envisioned when it adopted its pioneer's 
preference rule in 1991. The agency embraced the idea in an effort to reform a 
half-century-old license-approval process that many believed worked against 
entrepreneurs who had spent their time and money inventing new communications 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the early 1980s, the FCC allocated the airwaves through administrative 
hearings that subjectively evaluated competing applicants.

 McDonnell DC-X Rocket Gets Reprieve: McDonnell Douglas Corp. said its radical 
DC-X space-launch rocket, which was about to be mothballed after exhausting its 
initial government funding, will instead remain "in a readiness state" thanks 
to a $1-million infusion from NASA. In its first three flight tests last year, 
the DC-X fulfilled its goal of lifting off and then landing vertically, but 
plans for more flights were scrapped when the money ran out. NASA and the 
Defense Department will spend two months studying ways to finance the remaining 
tests, McDonnell said.

 Chicago Purchasing Index Falls: The city's economic picture took a slight dip 
in January, the Purchasing Management Assn. of Chicago said, the first 
indication that last month's harsh weather may have taken a bite out of the 
economy. The Chicagoland Business Barometer fell to a seasonally adjusted 59.6% 
in January from a revised 62.2% in December. An index below 50% signals a 
slowing manufacturing economy.

 Aetna Plan Draws Mixed Reviews: Aetna Life & Casualty Co.'s $1-billion 
restructuring plan was applauded by stock investors but criticized by rating 
agencies.Aetna's stock closed up $3.50 at $63.375 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange after some analysts recommended a buy. But Duff & Phelps downgraded 
the insurer's senior debt rating to AA-minus from AA amid concerns that the 
restructuring charges will weaken Aetna's earnings. A.M. Best Co. said it 
placed Aetna's "excellent" rating under review. The plan, unveiled Friday, 
involves 4,000 job cuts.

PERSONAL INCOME AND SPENDING INCREASE AT HEALTHY RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans' personal incomes and spending increased in 1993 at rates that 
economists see as harbingers of healthy expansion this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Incomes rose 4.7% last year, while inflation rose just 2.7%.Spending rose 
6.1%, the biggest increase since a 6.8 gain in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "These numbers do confirm a solid year of economic growth," said David Jones, 
an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. "There are hints that we ended the year 
on the stronger side, with a lot of momentum coming into 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest income and spending figures closely match economists' forecasts. 
For December, incomes rose 0.6% and spending rose 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts are concerned, however, that because spending outpaced incomes, 
consumers will be forced to slow consumption in 1994, reducing the rate of 
economic expansion. Yearly Increases Personal income

 Northrop Plans B-2 Layoffs: The company said 1,300 employees who work on the 
B-2 stealth bomber will be laid off this year as the program continues to 
gradually wind down. About 75% of the layoffs will occur at Northrop's Pico 
Rivera plant, the rest at its Palmdale facility, spokesman Edward Smith said. 
Northrop previously has said it plans to close the Pico Rivera plant -- which 
currently employs 6,800 -- in the late 1990s as production of the 20 B-2s on 
order nears completion.

 Saudis to Restructure Arms Payments: Saudi Arabia has signed an agreement 
under which the cash-strapped nation will restructure $9.2 billion in payments 
due over the next two years to five American defense contractors, U.S. defense 
officials said. The deal could also clear the way for a reported plan by the 
Saudis to buy $6 billion in commercial airliners.The officials said the deal 
was signed Saturday by representatives of the two governments and of McDonnell 
Douglas, Raytheon, General Dynamics, FMC and General Motors. The agreement 
chiefly affects a $9-billion deal by the Saudis to buy 72 McDonnell F-15 
fighters. Instead of taking delivery of two jets monthly beginning next year, 
the Saudis will buy one a month, said the officials, who asked not to be 
identified.

KHAN CONCEDES DEFEAT IN EFFORT TO OUST ICN CHAIRMAN PANIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rafi M. Khan, the dissident investor seeking to oust the chairman of ICN 
Pharmaceuticals Inc., conceded defeat Monday but vowed to keep pressing for 
management changes at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders are to vote at the company's annual meeting today on a proposal 
to replace Chairman Milan Panic and the other eight ICN board members with a 
new six-member slate that would include Khan, who owns 120,000 shares of the 
pharmaceutical company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may lose, but I am not a quitter," said Khan, who is also wrestling with 
criminal allegations that surfaced as a result of ICN's efforts to discredit 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan launched his effort to unseat Panic in April, accusing the 63-year-old 
chairman of drawing an excessive salary and of breaking federal laws by 
managing the Costa Mesa-based firm while serving as prime minister of his 
homeland, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Khan's campaign for changes in ICN's boardroom was all but scuttled when 
questions arose about his own past, including allegations that he fled the 
United Kingdom under a cloud of suspicion that he was involved in a securities 
scam to defraud the British government. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN officials, who had long predicted they would easily win the shareholder 
vote, responded to Khan's statement Monday with guarded enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate his concession," ICN spokesman David Calef said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company will not back off from its feud with Khan, whom it charges in 
a lawsuit with using inside information to wage a proxy fight, Calef said. ICN 
has already spent millions of dollars to fend off Khan's challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many investors share Khan's displeasure with ICN's management, the 
largest institutional shareholders, who control more than 10% of the company's 
stock, are expected to stand behind Panic. Some observers estimate that ICN can 
expect to garner 70% of the shares voted today, compared to the 30% pledged to 
Khan.

NEW SOROS FUND AND GE CAPITAL TO INVEST IN ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GE Capital Corp. and the fund group headed by George Soros, the Wall Street 
billionaire and philanthropist, are joining forces to invest in electric power 
plants in developing countries, the two sides announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Global Power Investments will raise at least $2.5 billion and invest 
it in building or running privately owned power plants, the partners said. The 
fund will initially focus on Mexico and Asia, particularly China, India and 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the rapid economic growth of numerous emerging markets around the world, 
this is an opportune time to invest in electrical power generating plants and 
to help facilitate their construction," said Gary Wendt, chairman of GE 
Capital, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Both GE Capital and Quantum Industrial Holdings, a new fund that will be 
managed by Soros Fund Management, will put up $200 million for the new fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Finance Corporation, the private financing arm of the World 
Bank, has signed a letter of intent to add $50 million to the new venture. The 
rest of the money will be raised from other investors. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital has $4.5 billion in investments in electric power projects, most in 
the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett J. Santos, a director with the International Finance Corp., said, 
"Foreign private investment is important for the growth of the power sector in 
developing countries. The demand for electricity can no longer be satisfied 
through financing from public sector sources or multilateral lending agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 While Soros is deeply involved in humanitarian efforts and projects supporting 
democracy in Eastern Europe, his new fund will be aimed at making profits for 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Soros' six investment funds have net assets of $12 billion and invest in 
stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and real estate. He is considered the 
highest-paid person on Wall Street, earning at least $650 million in 1992 from 
his fees and his stake in his investment funds, according to Financial World 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Published reports have said Soros' flagship Quantum fund earned a 65% to 70% 
return for investors last year. A spokesman for the company would not provide 
exact figures but said those numbers were in the correct range. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Soros fund plans to raise up to $1.4 billion from investors in four of 
its other funds. It may invest in other electric power generation projects in 
addition to Global Power Investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Soros' other funds, the new fund will be off-shore, closed to U.S. 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital is a subsidiary of General Electric Co., based in Stamford, Conn.

PEOPLE: LOCKHART NAMED PRESIDENT OF MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MasterCard International on Monday named Eugene Lockhart, a banking consultant 
who once ran a major credit card operation in Britain, its new president and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment came a week after the unexpected announcement that Alex W. 
(Pete) Hart, was leaving to run Advanta Corp., a major credit card issuer based 
in Horsham, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart, 43, has been executive vice president of First Manhattan Consulting 
Group since 1992 and prior to that spent six years at Midland Bank PLC in 
London, where he served as chief executive of U.K. banking and group 
operations. At Midland, Lockhart oversaw domestic banking, which included 3 
million credit cards and 1 1/2 million debit cards in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart also has been an executive at Marsh & McLennan Companies, a major 
commercial insurer, and the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart was widely respected throughout the credit card industry for 
reinvigorating MasterCard. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart served as chairman of the London Clearing House for Automatic 
Payments, which handles electronic payments. 
</P>
<P>
 He also served on a recent MasterCard task force concerning the future of 
debit cards, which allow consumers to deduct money from checking accounts 
instead of credit lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart's appointment will be effective March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 MasterCard, an association for banks that issue cards under the brand name, 
was accepted in more than 10.6 million locations and generated more than $258 
billion in transactions worldwide in 1992, the most recent figures available. 
Visa International had $458 billion in charge volume in 1992.

 California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest public 
pension fund with $80 billion in assets, named Sheryl Pressler chief investment 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler currently directs the $5.3-billion pension fund at the St. Louis 
aerospace giant McDonnell Douglas Corp. At CalPERS, she will succeed DeWitt 
Bowman, who is retiring after almost five years in the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler, who was unavailable for comment, will be responsible for deciding 
what percentage of assets should go into stocks, bonds and other instruments 
and for recommending specific investments to the fund's 13-member board. She 
will also supervise in-house money managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman has seen assets almost double and has been responsible for drastic 
changes in the fund's investments. Under Bowman, the fund began investing in 
international equities and bonds, which now account for about 16% of total 
assets.

 Like the October wildfire that razed more than 300 homes in Laguna Beach, the 
Jan. 17 earthquake that turned so many lives upside-down has also upended 
supply and demand in the Los Angeles-area housing market, bringing unlikely 
relief to many long-suffering property owners but only renewed grief to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and landlords whose wallets have been thinning for months because 
they were not able to sell their vacant houses or rent empty apartments say 
that they are now besieged by tenants displaced by the temblor.

quake's epicenter are spilling over into surrounding areas, creating a 
mini-sales boom from Woodland Hills to Agoura on the west and across the San 
Gabriel Valley in the east, real estate agents say. 
</P>
<P>
 The same sort of phenomenon occurred in Laguna Beach in the aftermath of last 
fall's 17,000-acre brush fire that destroyed 366 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a sizable amount of standing inventory removed from the market right 
after the fire" by victims looking for temporary housing, said Jim Vermilya, 
manager of the Grubb & Ellis-Better Homes & Gardens Realty office in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of homes that had been for sale for a long time but hadn't sold 
because of the soft market were grabbed up by fire victims determined to stay 
in Laguna Beach while their homes were being rebuilt, he said. Vermilya said 
his office "leased more than 100 units," most of them for one-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake, however, had little apparent impact on real estate activity in 
Orange County, according to brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to order a couple of reinspections on properties that were in escrow," 
said broker Sharon Larson of Prudential California Realty in Fullerton. "But 
that was for people moving here from out of the country. We didn't have any 
sales drop out of escrow; in fact, the day of the earthquake was a pretty good 
day for us. People here (in Orange County) have taken it pretty much in 
stride." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Los Angeles, many home shoppers have retreated to the sidelines while 
the ground continues to shake from aftershocks. And hundreds of home sales are 
in limbo because lenders are insisting that properties be reinspected for 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some opportunists have rushed in, hoping to pick up a bargain in a housing 
market that only recently had emerged from a prolonged and severe recession. 
Harried salespeople and lenders are working overtime, helping the new clients 
while trying to salvage the deals already in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like trying to navigate through the Bermuda Triangle," said Jamie 
Ramstead, a Northridge real estate agent trying to save the six sales he has in 
escrow while also repairing $60,000 in damage to his home. "Most of us have 
never been through something like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake rendered more than 15,000 homes and apartments unlivable, throwing 
more than 30,000 people onto streets from Santa Monica to Simi Valley, 
according to city agencies and disaster relief officials. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many families looking for new places to live, sellers who have lost 
thousands of dollars while their vacant homes sat unsold in a depressed market 
have been flooded with calls from prospective renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Kennedy has been making the $950-a-month mortgage payment on her home in 
Canoga Park that she vacated last July after finding a new job in Oregon. The 
house sustained little damage from the quake, so she flew back to Los Angeles 
last week and leased it to a displaced Northridge family for $1,850 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure I'll recoup what I've lost by the summer, and then I'll be making 
good money because the family signed a one-year lease," said Kennedy, who 
reviews contracts for the federal government.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for all those people who lost their homes, but it's nice to 
finally make something off this house. The last six months have bled me dry." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has also been a boon for sellers in many San Fernando Valley 
communities that were spared the most serious damage. Thus, some would-be 
buyers are steering clear of hard-hit Northridge and Reseda in favor of nearby 
Woodland Hills and north into southern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Bolin, sales manager of the Coldwell Banker real estate office in 
Woodland Hills, said his agents sold a half-dozen properties over weekend -- 
even though many buyers stayed home to watch the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the quake, we'd be happy with just three or four sales," Bolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many put their home-buying plans on ice after the quake hit, some new 
buyers have moved in to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Lipson, vice president of an executive search firm, lost her 
$535-a-month rent-controlled Santa Monica apartment in the quake. Because it 
would cost her twice that for a comparable apartment, she wants to buy a 
condominium, hoping her mortgage-interest deductions will keep her overall 
housing expenses at a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good deals on the West Side right now," Lipson said. As a 
bonus, she added, "it's a little easier to tell which buildings are well-built. 
Some of them have just fallen apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not all of those new buyers are being welcomed by real estate agents or 
their sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Lamb, co-owner of Century 21 Lamb Realty in Northridge, said she and 
her staff have gotten several calls from investors hoping to pick up homes at a 
tiny fraction of their normal prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten our share of bottom-feeders, but they're not having much 
success," said Lamb, whose home also sustained major damage during the quake. 
"The law says that we have to present their offers to our sellers, but there's 
nothing that says we have to like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many buyers and sellers who were waiting for escrow to close when the quake 
hit are in limbo. About 1,000 deals were pending in the San Fernando Valley 
when the earthquake struck, according to the local Realtors' association. A few 
hundred were in escrow in Santa Monica and adjacent communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lenders are requiring every house that they had agreed to finance in the 
county be reinspected for damage. As a result, some appraisers and inspectors 
have been busy taking a second look at properties more than 75 miles away from 
the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house I'm buying in Sherman Oaks didn't get hurt a bit, but I can't close 
the deal because my (appraiser) is busy looking at houses down in Long Beach," 
grumbled Nick Smith, who drives a delivery truck. "The whole thing is stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side is Rhoark Rollband in Encino, who had been trying to sell 
his condominium for nearly a year before the earthquake hit, and had already 
reduced the asking price for his two-bedroom loft to $124,000 from $129,000. 
The local housing market was showing signs of picking up, and he was confident 
the home would sell soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rollband's unit weathered the quake well, the temblor damaged several 
other buildings at the sprawling complex on White Oak Avenue and knocked out 
gas service for nearly two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Now he has slashed his price again -- this time to $109,000 -- and is willing 
to take even less to make a quick sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meet my price, and I'll even throw in my furniture," said Rollband, a 
salesman who says the quake finally persuaded him that it is time to move to 
Denver. "I just want to cut my losses and get out of L.A. as fast as I can."

 Infinity Reportedly Cleared to Buy KRTH-FM: The Federal Communications 
Commission today will announce that Infinity Broadcasting Corp. can proceed 
with plans to buy the big Los Angeles radio station, the New York Times 
reported in today's editions.The FCC's 2-1 vote came despite the agency's 
concern about purported indecent on-air remarks made by radio personality and 
Infinity employee Howard Stern, which also are the subject of at least two 
indecency complaints filed by the public. But the FCC's decision also levies an 
additional $400,000 in fines on Infinity, which already has been fined $1.2 
million by the commission in recent years because of Stern's comments, the 
newspaper said. Infinity is fighting the fines in court.

TAKECARE EXECUTIVES DEFEND ACTIONS IN SALE TO FHP OF FOUNTAIN VALLEY

<P>
 TakeCare Inc., which FHP Inc. in Fountain Valley is trying to acquire, said 
Monday that it has filed court documents denying shareholder accusations that 
top executives were trying to enrich themselves by arranging the pending sale. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP said last month that it offered to pay $829 million in cash and stock for 
its Concord competitor, which was less than the total value of a stock swap 
offered by United HealthCare Corp. in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP offered $62 a share in cash and stock, while United HealthCare offered 
$64.50 a share in an all-stock transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of TakeCare shareholders, led by a wealthy Pittsburgh family, filed a 
lawsuit alleging that the board majority rejected a better offer because the 
FHP deal would provide top TakeCare managers with more personal cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But TakeCare attorneys argued that executives acted properly in the FHP deal 
and had shareholders' interests in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, FHP spokeswoman Ria Carlson said that her company was continuing its 
work to acquire TakeCare. Carlson said she expects the deal to become final by 
June. JAMES M. GOMEZ

KAWASAKI MOTORS BUYS RELATED FIRM

<P>
 Kawasaki Motors Corp. U.S.A. has purchased Kawasaki Loaders Inc., a 
distributor of material loaders used in mining, construction, forestry, waste 
management and other heavy industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawasaki Loaders, based in Kennesaw, Ga., had been jointly owned by Sumitomo 
Trading Co. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, the parent of Kawasaki Motors. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Noda, president of Kawasaki Motors Corp., which was established in 
Irvine in 1969, said the acquisition is a logical step in broadening the 
company's markets in North America. Until recently, Kawasaki Motors was solely 
a consumer goods company. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 24, the company launched its expansion with the announcement that it 
had acquired exclusive North American distribution rights for Staffa Motors, a 
manufacturer of hydraulic motors used in heavy machinery applications, such as 
offshore drilling rigs and earth-moving machinery. Kawasaki Heavy Industries 
owns Staffa, which it purchased from British industrial giant Vickers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Staffa and Kawasaki Loader products, Kawasaki Motors Corp. 
distributes Kawasaki motorcycles, Jet Ski watercraft, all-terrain vehicles, 
utility vehicles, portable power generators and gasoline engines for lawn care 
equipment, construction machinery, and other industrial and commercial uses.

ARMOR ALL BUYS LINE OF HOME PRODUCTS; GROWTH: MOVE ALLOWS AUTOMOTIVE GOODS FIRM 
TO DIVERSIFY AND ESTABLISH A HOME-CARE DIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Armor All Products Corp. stepped out of the car and into the home on Monday 
with the purchase of a line of products from a Tallahassee, Fla., company. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Agri-Products Special Markets Inc., sold Armor All its E-Z D and 
E-Z Deck Wash brands. The products restore wood decks and home siding. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase "establishes our new home-care division, providing us with an 
umbrella for future growth in non-automotive products," said Kenneth M. Evans, 
president and chief executive officer of Armor All.  
</P>
<P>
 He added that a key growth strategy is to broaden the company's line of 
consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 Armor All's move is a good one from an investor's viewpoint, said Mark 
Matheson, an analyst with the Crowell, Weedon & Co. brokerage in Los Angeles. 
"I like it," he said. "One of the things that held back their stock is they 
were seen as a one-category company. This will diversify their risk." 
</P>
<P>
 It also allows the company to leverage its strength in the consumer 
advertising and marketing arenas, Matheson pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock was up 75 cents in Nasdaq trading Monday, to close at 
$21.75 exchange -- a 52-week high for Armor All. 
</P>
<P>
 E-Z Deck Wash is a leading manufacturer of exterior wood deck cleaning and 
restoring products, Armor All said, with a 65% market share. When applied to 
weathered, gray wood decks, fences and siding, E-Z Deck Wash cleans stains from 
mildew, algae and fungus while removing the grayness. 
</P>
<P>
 Other products include E-Z D brand cleaners: vinyl and stucco wash, pre-paint 
house wash, roof wash and aluminum wash. The products are sold in home centers, 
hardware stores and lumber and building material stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Armor All, which is best known for Armor All Protectant, also markets 
automotive waxes and polishes, carwash products and car cleaners, which are 
sold under the Armor All and Rain Dance brands. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first half of its 1994 fiscal year, Armor All reported profit of 
$9.5 million on revenue of $84 million. Armor All Products 
</P>

TECHNOLOGY: ON SUPERHIGHWAY, IN CYPERSPACE, THE BUZZ IS ON DIGITAL HUGENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Does anyone talk about the "global village" anymore? How about high-definition 
television? 
</P>
<P>
 Those buzzwords of years past have been drowned out by newer descriptions of 
techno-paradise: virtual reality, the Internet, cyberspace, cyberpunk, the 
information highway and superhighway, the digital highway, the electronic 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the names stick, and sometimes they fade out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a new word here for it all: Digital Hugeness, " said Martin Alper, 
president of Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc., a video game publisher in 
Irvine. "It reminds us there is a lot of hype out there, and we have to 
translate that hype into reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Alper's company makes interactive games and other products for the digital 
future -- whatever it might be called. Alper isn't fond of the highway 
metaphors, which he says will disappear in a year or so. Virtual reality has 
real applications, so it deserves the heavy usage. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes "cyberpunk," but only as it reminds him of a specific science-fiction 
theme that focuses on the computer hacker culture such as in William Gibson's 
"Neuromancer." And 500-channel interactive television reminds him of Bruce 
Springsteen's song, "57 Channels and Nothin' On." 
</P>
<P>
 So Digital Hugeness may have to do.

MONTGOMERY WARD TO PAY $310,000 IN FALSE AD SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Montgomery Ward & Co., the huge Chicago-based retailing chain, has agreed to 
pay $310,000 in civil penalties to settle a false-advertising lawsuit filed in 
June by the Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third time in a decade that the company has been ordered by 
California courts to halt misleading advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's settlement includes a permanent injunction that applies to all of the 
company's stores in California and prohibits misleading advertising tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Those tactics include increasing retail prices before applying discounts, 
adding items in advertised sale lists that are not offered at reduced prices, 
and stating that items are on sale for a limited time when the sale actually 
lasts much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Montgomery Ward could not be reached for comment. In agreeing to 
pay the fine and accept the injunction, the company did not admit any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Shade, the Orange County deputy district attorney who handled the case, 
said the civil complaint involved advertising campaigns as far back at 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the case was developed in conjunction with the Sacramento district 
attorney's office, which had obtained a similar injunction against Montgomery 
Ward in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting complaints from consumers," Shade said, "and we knew that 
there were two prior injunctions. We felt they weren't living up to them, so we 
decided to look at the situation again." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 1990 Sacramento County action, the chain was sued by the 
state attorney general's office in the early 1980s and was ordered by the court 
in that case to cease similarly misleading advertising tactics, Shade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County court order also requires Montgomery Ward to document all 
price reductions and maintain that documentation and copies of all sale 
advertisements for at least two years for review by the attorney general's 
office or any district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Montgomery Ward has stores in Buena Park, Fullerton, 
Huntington Beach, Santa Ana and Mission Viejo.

VIDEO GAME FIRM INVESTS IN START-UP; TECHNOLOGY: IRVINE'S INTERPLAY PRODUCTIONS 
HAS ACQUIRED A MINORITY STAKE IN PALO ALTO-BASED NORTHSTAR STUDIOS, WHICH IS 
DEVELOPING FUTURISTIC 'INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT' SOFTWARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Interplay Productions Inc., the second-largest video game publisher in Orange 
County, said Monday that it had acquired a minority stake in a Northern 
California start-up headed by a veteran of the video game industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Interplay said it invested an undisclosed amount of money and technology in 
Northstar Studios in Palo Alto, which is developing futuristic "interactive 
entertainment" software for video games. The deal calls for Northstar to 
develop games for Interplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Northstar was started in December by Ronald Spitzer, 33, who has worked as an 
executive and manager at several computer game companies. Most recently, he was 
licensing director for Crystal Dynamics Inc. in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ronald has a great ability to land key development talent," said Brian Fargo, 
president of Irvine-based Interplay. "This is a strategic move for us. We 
expect he will deliver a series of games that we will market over a period of 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Interplay's investment in Northstar Studios follows an industry trend for 
managing rising game development costs. Companies are teaming up with allies, 
subcontractors or investors, especially in preparation for the coming age of 
interactive games and TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Such alliances come in different forms. Two weeks ago, Blockbuster Video 
Entertainment invested $30 million in Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc., 
which is Orange County's largest video game company with 250 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 These deals are an acknowledgment of a coming convergence of digital 
industries, including Hollywood films, video game publishing, cable TV, 
consumer electronics and computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 Spitzer also has worked for Electronic Arts in San Mateo and in 1986 was a 
founder of New World Computing, which created the "Might & Magic" fantasy game 
series that sold more than 800,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northstar, Spitzer is rounding up a team of talented game developers from 
around North America, with offices in Texas, Northern California and on the 
East Coast. He envisions a company of about 100 people in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is to tap into the talent where they want to live," he said. "I don't 
want to be a publisher. Been there, done that. I want to develop great 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers manufacture, market and distribute games; developers create them. 
He has already recruited game producer Nicholas Beliaeff, who produced "Tony 
LaRussa Baseball" and the "Eye of the Beholder" computer game series. 
</P>
<P>
 Northstar is specializing in developing software for game systems that process 
data in 32-bit chunks. Such systems, which can process data much faster than 
the original 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System, are being developed by major 
industry players. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's 32-bit systems, including the recently launched 3DO "multi-player" and 
the Atari Corp.'s Jaguar machine, can run software faster and feature better 
quality graphics than conventional 16-bit systems such as the Sega Genesis or 
the Nintendo Super Entertainment System. Sega and Nintendo are also planning to 
launch game systems that can process data in 32 bits or larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Interplay is a 10-year-old private company founded by Fargo with 1993 sales 
estimated at $60 million. Its current hits include compact disc games entitled 
"Star Trek: The 25th Anniversary" and "Lord of the Rings."

YUEN BUYS BIG STAKE IN SOUND INNOVATOR; TECHNOLOGY: THE AST RESEARCH CO-FOUNDER 
GAINS CONTROLLING INTEREST IN YOUNG NEWPORT BEACH-BASED SRS LABS, WHICH HAS A 
SYSTEM THAT DISTRIBUTES NOISE IN THREE DIMENSIONS.

 Thomas C.K. Yuen, who made a fortune as one of the founders of computer maker 
AST Research Inc., said Monday that he has bought a majority stake in a young 
Orange County company striving to create the successor to stereo sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuen invested $2.71 million in SRS Labs Inc., a 7-month-old Newport Beach 
company. He will have a controlling interest and assume the titles of chairman 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 SRS purchased a novel sound technology developed by Hughes Aircraft Co., which 
decided last year to sell its sound retrieval system -- SRS -- to focus on its 
core aerospace business. The system distributes sound in three dimensions, 
taking it from standard stereo speakers and enriching it so that the listener 
has the impression of being immersed in it, said Stephen Sedmak, president of 
SRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuen, a computer marketing maverick, co-founded AST in 1981 and helped it grow 
to a billion-dollar company. He resigned in 1992 after a power struggle with 
co-founder Safi U. Qureshey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking into the multimedia area, which is in an emerging stage, 
and I stumbled on this company and its technology," Yuen said in an interview 
Monday. "The staff gave me a demonstration. But even though I have a hearing 
problem, it sounded great." 
</P>
<P>
 Sedmak, a part-owner, will remain as president and the top executive for 
day-to-day management. Yuen will act as a business adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "This accelerates our ability to establish SRS as a standard," Sedmak said. 
"We will use Tom's connections in the industry and his stature to reach our 
goals more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Investment banker Walter Cruttenden III will relinquish the title of chairman 
but remain an investor and board member, Sedmak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has seven employees, including Arnold Klayman, the inventor of 
SRS. Klayman, 67, spent 25 years developing sound technology at his small 
research company in Costa Mesa. Hughes bought the technology in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The first product was a component that adapted ordinary stereo systems so they 
could sport SRS sound. Since June, SRS Labs has licensed its technology to 
companies designing components for for personal computers and video games. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has also licensed the technology to a number of TV manufacturers. 
Through licensing, Sedmak said, he hopes to create a company with $30 million 
to $70 million in revenue within five years.YUEN, THOMAS C K

 Among the titles that Virgin Interactive has in development is a video game 
version of "The Lion King," based on an upcoming Walt Disney Co. animated 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin collaborated with Disney and Sega of America Inc. to create a video 
game based on the movie Aladdin. Now Alper says that cooperation, led by a 
15-person Virgin development team in Las Vegas, is being taken further in the 
Lion King project. 
</P>
<P>
 Alper says Disney tells him that the new film may top Aladdin in box-office 
receipts. If that is the case, the video game could be published this fall on 
both the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis formats, only a few months after the 
movie's summer release.

VIRGINIA LAWMAKERS BACK AWAY FROM DISNEY AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BAKER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawmakers said Monday that they plan to withdraw a proposal to have Prince 
William County borrow up to $50 million for water and sewer lines for a Walt 
Disney Co. theme park, saying they are looking at other options, including 
asking the company to pay for the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The company might be asked to put up the money and possibly recover it over 
time through tax breaks, said Delegate Harry J. Parrish (R-Manassas), a chief 
sponsor of Virginia Gov. George Allen's incentive package to help Disney build 
the park near Haymarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a switch would be a change to Allen's original proposal and a clear sign 
that Disney's America park faces a tougher time in the General Assembly than 
many originally predicted. Parrish said he will make a final decision after a 
meeting today of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, but he said 
that "we'll probably just strike the bills" from the docket. 
</P>
<P>
 Theme park opponents reacted with predictable support of the proposals, saying 
the state should not subsidize Disney's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The delegates and senators are hearing from back home. That's what's changing 
the landscape," said Robert Elliott, spokesman for Protect, a Prince 
William-based group opposing the park. Elliott said the group sent 50 people to 
lobby the legislators last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's proposed package calls for the state to spend $163.2 million for road 
improvements on and around the 3,000-acre site, relocation costs and a tourism 
promotional program. 
</P>
<P>
 While embracing the idea of luring Disney to Virginia, some legislators have 
complained that Allen gave away too much in negotiations with the 
multibillion-dollar corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Three studies by Disney, park opponents and the state have produced varying 
forecasts of the tax revenue and jobs that the park and its spinoff commercial 
and residential development would produce.

 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said Monday that it has 
awarded McDonnell Douglas Aerospace in Huntington Beach almost $1 million to 
continue its research and development of a reusable rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Delta Clipper DC-X program, which is developing a rocket that 
can take off and land without separating stages or using parachutes, was being 
tested at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. It completed three such 
tests successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional cash will allow the company to continue its testing of the 
rocket.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: PIONEER BANCORP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The holding company for Pioneer Bank on Friday reported a loss of $9.1 million 
for 1993, compared to a $1.9-million loss in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer Bancorp said most of last year's loss was attributable to bad loans 
and to real estate it wound up owning after having to foreclose. The 
Fullerton-based bank said it had to set aside $10.9 million during the year to 
cover those losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank said it improved its operating profitability enough to seek new 
capital. Pioneer said it had hired an investment banker in December to help it 
find new investors.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: GLENDALE FEDERAL CUTS LOSS TO $39.8 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Federal Bank said it cut its fiscal second-quarter loss in half from 
a year earlier, to $39.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale-based savings and loan attributed the loss in the latest quarter, 
which compared with a loss of $79.4 million in the same quarter a year earlier, 
to a large provision for loan losses and a decline in interest income from 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first six months ended Dec. 31, Glendale posted a loss of $59.7 
million, compared with a loss of $96.2 million during the same period in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Stephen J. Trafton, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Glendale Federal, said its troubled loans and foreclosed real estate have 
continued to decline. However, Glendale Federal also estimated that it has $1.5 
billion in real estate loans in the earthquake-affected areas of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Federal, which completed a $451-million recapitalization last fall, 
said the Office of Thrift Supervision declared on Dec. 31 that the thrift was 
adequately capitalized, meaning that it had sufficient money on hand to guard 
against sudden losses.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: GREAT WESTERN REPORTS LOSS OF $18.9 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Great Western Financial Corp. of Chatsworth reported a fourth-quarter loss of 
$18.9 million, compared with a loss of $97.3 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, the parent company of Great Western Bank said it turned a 
profit of $62 million, down 27% from a profit of $85 million in 1992.Great 
Western said its latest quarter loss was due to provisions for real estate and 
loan losses of $149 million, and restructuring charges of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring includes the elimination of 1,000 jobs, half through 
layoffs. As a result of the restructuring, the company said it expects annual 
savings of more than $100 million beginning in 1995. James F. Montgomery, 
chairman and chief executive officer, also said he did not expect a "material 
loss" from the recent Northridge earthquake. Great Western's assets as of Dec. 
31 were $38.3 billion, about the same as a year ago.

in. Three San Fernando Valley Sav-On stores are closed, along with their 
pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
 So for many local residents, the hunt is on for places to shop. And for the 
retailers that have managed to reopen, there is the opportunity to win some new 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among the people out in Northridge, I don't know that there's a great amount 
of understanding where we are located," said Allen Oblow, general manager of 
the Media City Center mall in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 So the shopping center is running newspaper and radio ads. It has banners hung 
outside announcing that it's open. Many people have called to ask for 
directions, so Oblow plans to include a locater map in the next series of ads. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past several days, traffic at the mall has increased 15% to 20% for 
this time of the year, and last weekend its corridors were crowded. Customers 
literally bumped against each other in Bullock's and at Ikea, a big home 
furnishings store. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's just a temporary thing and we can help people out, that's great," 
said Oblow. "If it becomes a permanent thing, that's great too." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolette Abernathy, Glendale Galleria marketing director, the largest 
shopping center in the Valley area, is hoping for a similar pickup in business 
based on the number of calls the mall is receiving from people asking how to 
get there. The mall has a Nordstrom, Robinsons-May, JC Penney, Mervyn's and 260 
shops, all of which are open. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local shopping centers that are at least partially open include the 
Panorama Mall in Panorama City, where some stores have reported a huge jump in 
sales; the Sherman Oaks Galleria, where about half the shops reopened last 
weekend, and the Promenade mall in Woodland Hills, which boasts the only 
operating Bullock's in the West Valley but is losing a Saks Fifth Avenue store 
that was damaged and will not reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shops at Woodland Hills' Topanga Plaza reopened on Friday. At Fallbrook 
Mall in Canoga Park, a Target and most of the smaller shops are back in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 But many open malls have anchor department stores that are still off-limits. 
That could prove a benefit for those centers with operating anchor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 In the parking lot at Topanga Plaza mall in Woodland Hills on Friday -- just a 
few hours after that mall partially reopened -- a man shouted frantically to 
another driver, "Is Nordstrom open? Any of the department stores?" Told they 
were all closed, he asked, "What about the other mall?" as he gestured in the 
direction of the Promenade a block away. When told the Bullock's there had 
reopened, he turned around and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the Promenade Bullock's, Bianca Wolter of Northridge shopped for her 
favorite brand of cosmetics. The Bullock's she usually patronizes, in the 
Northridge Fashion Center, collapsed in the earthquake and has been condemned. 
Bullock's says it wants to rebuild the Northridge store and is in discussions 
with the mall developer. 
</P>
<P>
 A table set up in front of the Promenade Bullock's advertised "Earthquake and 
Bridal Registry." Sales clerk Murray Rittner explained that customers can 
register for merchandise that their friends could buy to replace items lost in 
the earthquake, just as someone would register for wedding gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of the temporary shops set up in the mall to sell Bullock's housewares 
while the top floor of department store undergoes repairs, Marion and Frank 
Mendelson of Woodland Hills shopped for wine glasses to replace those broken in 
the quake. "I was serving wine in regular water glasses," said Frank. "It was 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Bethers, marketing director at Topanga Plaza, said she expects 
business to pick up when Nordstrom and housewares chain Crate & Barrel reopen 
in a few weeks, because both stores tend to be shopping destinations in 
themselves. The nearest Nordstrom stores at the Glendale Galleria and the 
Westside Pavillion are both open; the closest Crate & Barrel in Century City is 
also open. "We definitely will feel an effect because those stores are down," 
but when Nordstrom is up and running "we feel we'll do well," Bethers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Mueller, general manager at the Valencia Town Center in Santa Clarita, 
also expects business to gain steam. Because of severe traffic congestion due 
to a downed freeway interchange leading into Santa Clarita, many local 
residents who work in the San Fernando Valley might now shop at her mall 
instead of spending more time on the road going to shopping places in the 
Valley, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia mall has a Robinsons-May, JC Penney and Sears, all of which are 
open. Traffic was brisk last weekend as customers shopped for housewares, 
tools, televisions and mattresses, Mueller said. Another lure: The mall has 
started selling Metrolink tickets and "the service has just boomed" since the 
earthquake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the busiest places in the Valley during the past several days have been 
stores carrying housewares and home-repair products. 
</P>
<P>
 The Target store in Woodland Hills, which reopened two days after the quake, 
has been 30% busier than normal, said manager Joyce Atkinson. The chain has 
made supplying its Target stores that are open in the area a top priority so 
items remain plentiful, she said. "People are thanking us for being open." 
</P>
<P>
 At another Target store, in the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park -- where 
Mervyn's, Sears and the JC Penney Outlet store are closed -- Doris Dennis of 
Winnetka piled flashlights, paper plates and rubber containers into her 
shopping cart on Friday. "I'm going to eat off paper plates till I'm sure of 
the water supply," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away at Home Depot in Canoga Park, the parking lot was packed 
before noon Friday. Inside, shelves were well-stocked and customers shopped for 
everything from mirrors to pipes to cabinet latches. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Forrester of Chatsworth loaded three bags of dry stucco mix in his cart to 
fix earthquake cracks in his house and driveway. "I'm not too anxious to get 
started because I don't know if it's over yet," he said, referring to the 
frequent aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian Rennie of West Hills bought flashlights, batteries and gloves. "It's 
like closing the door after the horses have gone out," she laughed. But after 
groping around in the dark following the earthquake, she hopes to be prepared 
from now on. She even planned to buy fluorescent paint to make markers in her 
home that would be visible in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 But Home Depot store manager Bob Barnett said he has begun to see a shift in 
demand for products since the first days after the quake. "At first it was 
flashlights and tarps and emergency items to get back into homes," he said. 
"Now we're seeing things that are not as critical, but that need replacing, 
like brackets to hold shelves in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Stores that accept Red Cross and Salvation Army vouchers also reported big 
increases in business. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Kmart in North Hollywood, customer traffic has increased about 25% in 
recent days. Manager Mark Landis attributed the jump in part to the temporary 
closing of Kmarts in Northridge and San Fernando. But the vouchers are also 
generating so much business, he said, that three cash registers have been 
devoted just to voucher-paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest-selling items have been the obvious earthquake related items, 
Landis said -- bottled water, lanterns, flashlights and batteries. But he also 
recalled one customer who purchased a $500 necklace to cheer up his 
quake-rattled wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sav-On Drugs chain responded to the temporary closing of three 
earthquake-damaged stores in Sherman Oaks, Granada Hills and Woodland Hills by 
moving pharmacy files and automatically transferring phone calls to the nearest 
open Sav-Ons. Prescription drugs, bottled water and batteries have been the 
biggest-selling items, said a manager at the Studio City Sav-On, which is 
handling business from the closed Sherman Oaks store. "Cosmetic sales are also 
going up," he said. "Why, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 A few frayed nerves began to surface at retail outlets Friday. At the Circuit 
City store in Woodland Hills, a customer argued loudly with a manager over 
prices on a television and videocassette recorder he wanted to replace those 
lost in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At Topanga Plaza, Sunshine Beauty Supply assistant manager Audrey Veith glared 
at a pile of shampoo and cosmetics that workers had thrown into big plastic 
bags prior to removing some asbestos that had been dislodged during the 
earthquake. "It's really horrible," she said, noting that cans of hair spray 
had exploded and other products were ruined. Veith did manage to restock 
shelves with hair coloring kits. "I knew the ladies would want their hair dye," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for some customers, shopping was simply an opportunity to return to 
normal living. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig and Erin Johnson, who moved to Reseda from Texas seven months ago, 
visited Topanga Plaza on Friday to buy Dallas Cowboys T-shirts. Maclynn Larsen 
of La Crescenta and Marilyn Schuler of Ventura figured the mall would be a good 
place to meet for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 And at WaldenBooks, a prominent display inspired by the earthquake, featuring 
home repair and traffic guides, produced not one sale, said assistant manager 
Joyce McDougald. "People are just buying what they normally buy."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: AFTER QUAKE, FIRMS RUSH TO TELECOMMUTING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of the recent earthquake, Pacific Bell, Great Western Bank of 
Chatsworth and Cigna have signed long-term leases for space at the Valencia 
Corporate Telecommuting Center, a 30,000-square-foot telecommuting building 
that has been wired with fiber-optics and other voice and data networking 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's owner, Valencia-based Newhall Land & Farming Co., said several 
other major companies are considering signing leases to use the center, which 
is expected to be fully occupied soon.The center opened last December with one 
occupant, CareAmerica, the Chatsworth-based health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommuting center on Rye Canyon Road is part of the Valencia Industrial 
Center. It was designed for use by businesses during emergencies or as backup 
offices. The center accommodates various telecommunication needs, including 
video-conferencing and voice mail. Newhall Land is a real estate and 
agricultural concern that is developing the community of Valencia.

QUAKE EXPECTED TO AID SOME HOUSING MARKETS; REAL ESTATE: SOME BUYERS FROM THE 
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SEEK FIRMER GROUND IN THE ANTELOPE AND SANTA CLARITA 
VALLEYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deadly Jan. 17 earthquake that rocked the San Fernando Valley has sent 
some home buyers trucking to the Antelope Valley looking for firmer ground and, 
safer, more affordable housing, local builders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprising number of shoppers and buyers are a relief to local builders 
and realtors, who feared initially that damaged freeways leading to and from 
the Antelope Valley might discourage Los Angeles-area residents, whose homes 
were damaged by the 6.6-magnitude quake, from looking farther north for 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 50% of our traffic this weekend was from outside the Antelope Valley. 
The previous week, all of our traffic was local," said Scott Richter, president 
of Centex Homes, a new home builder based in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Centex salespeople in Palmdale sold five homes over the weekend, ranging from 
the low $100,000s to almost $200,000, Richter said. Three buyers were from the 
San Fernando Valley, including two people who were looking to move quickly into 
their new homes because their apartments were destroyed by the Northridge 
quake, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "This weekend was a whole lot better than our original expectations. If we 
could sell five homes every week, it would be great," Richter said. 
</P>
<P>
 His optimism was echoed by other Antelope Valley builders, who said that 
results from the two weekends after the quake suggest that things are not going 
to be as bad as originally feared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traffic was up significantly at our two tracts in east Palmdale compared to 
the previous weekend. The majority of our visitors were from the San Fernando 
Valley," said Ed Parker, vice president of sales and marketing for new home 
builder Epic Development in east Palmdale. "We sold three homes over the 
weekend: Two of the buyers were from the San Fernando Valley and the other from 
the Santa Clarita Valley. It's looking promising." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said the Epic homes sold over the weekend ranged from $129,995 to 
$154,995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Building Industry Assn. has urged its members to use the 
special FHA loan package for earthquake victims in their advertisements to lure 
potential buyers whose homes were damaged or destroyed in last month's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be advertising next week, telling people they can get an FHA loan with 
zero down payment for a new home if their homes were damaged or destroyed in 
the quake," said Richter. This special FHA loan package is good up to mortgages 
of $150,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While most Southlanders think of the Antelope Valley as a desert community 
isolated by earthquake-damaged freeways, local businessmen and politicians are 
touting the area as a place where the future has already arrived, thanks to 
last month's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 They are using the FHA loan package and newly expanded Metrolink as selling 
points to persuade earthquake victims to move to a "newer, more modern" 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake has also shaken loose a lot of things that had been on the back 
burner for a long time. These things are here now, and it's up to us to make 
potential home buyers and commuters aware that the future has arrived here," 
said Kimberly Maevers, director of governmental affairs for the Antelope Valley 
BIA. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Northridge quake shook more than just buildings and lives on Jan. 
17; it also has cut through government red tape. Plans are under way to widen 
and improve the Antelope Valley Freeway, which connects the Antelope Valley to 
the Los Angeles Basin. And the earthquake forced transportation officials to 
buy additional Metrolink cars that increased the number of commuters from the 
Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys more than tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Metrolink opened stations in Lancaster and Palmdale months ahead of 
schedule to save commuting time for Antelope Valley residents, part of an 
unprecedented effort to build a new transportation system for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Metrolink surprised hundreds of commuters by opening a Spartan but 
working station at Acton, on the Sierra Highway, south of Angeles Forest 
Highway. Metrolink officials said they are committed to serving the Antelope 
Valley for one year after the quake, but will maintain service thereafter if 
current ridership remains constant. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, the quake gave the housing market in both valleys an added boost 
over the long term, said local builders. They expressed confidence that housing 
starts in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys will grow even faster when the 
damaged freeways leading to and from those areas are repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the task for Maevers and other builders is to persuade San 
Fernando Valley residents that the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys are not 
only affordable places to live, but accessible too, despite the nightly 
television pictures of gridlock on the damaged Antelope Valley and Golden State 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question about it. You look at the newscasts every night and see how bad 
the traffic is going back to Santa Clarita and you know that's got to turn off 
some people. But when the repairs (to the freeways) are completed later this 
year, and with the transit system already in place, we think it's going to 
create a demand for housing in the Santa Clarita Valley," said Vance Meyer, 
executive vice president at Pardee Construction, based in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee is working on two housing developments of 100 homes at the Northbridge 
development in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes under construction in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys are built 
according to newer and stricter earthquake safety codes. According to Meyer and 
other builders, the new homes fared very well in the earthquake. Builders are 
using the stricter building codes as selling points for the newly constructed 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter said San Fernando Valley residents visiting homes built by his company 
throughout the Antelope Valley are "asking a lot of questions" about the new 
building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at it from the standpoint of the buyer. He can buy a used home in the 
San Fernando Valley that was weakened by the quake, or he can buy a new home 
for about the same price or cheaper up here and know that it was built 
according to the latest codes," said Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Heflin, president of the Antelope Valley Board of Realtors, said that 
affordable new and used homes in the Antelope Valley already makes the area an 
attractive place for home buyers. The quake will benefit an already prosperous 
housing market in the Antelope Valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long term, it will make more people in the quake area look at the Antelope 
Valley as an option. Housing is already cheaper up here, and now we have 
Metrolink, which makes the commute into Los Angeles much more enjoyable. Those 
are two powerful incentives for people to move here," said Heflin.

EXHAUST SYSTEMS FIRM REVS UP PERFORMANCE; TRANSPORTATION: BORLA MAKES A NAME 
FOR ITSELF WITH CAR BUFFS. THEY SPEND BETWEEN $330 AND $3,000 FOR ITS PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sell American high-performance auto mufflers to the Japanese on their home 
turf? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just a pipe dream for Borla Performance Industries. Last month the 
Oxnard company introduced its first product for the Japanese, an exhaust system 
for Corvettes, at a Tokyo auto show. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Borla, president of the 11-year-old company, said marketing his 
exhaust systems in Japan is a sound move. "We're riding the wave of American 
automobiles that are winding up in Japan. Every year I see more and more," as 
jeeps, sports cars and Harley-Davidson motorcycles are getting popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla's company, which Borla claims did $3 million in sales last year, has 
made a name for itself with a line of stainless-steel exhaust systems. The 
systems extract more power from an auto or truck's engine because they work 
more efficiently at getting the hot gasses out of the engine than conventional 
exhaust pipes, mufflers and catalytic converters. Most of his customers are 
baby boomers who remember the "muscle cars" of the '60s and are willing to 
spend more to squeeze extra power out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ford, General Motors or Chrysler produce a vehicle, the mufflers are 
designed to be as quiet as possible, Borla said. But about 10% of the owners 
are willing to put up with a bit more noise to improve acceleration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of spending $60 at Midas for a new muffler, these car buffs will spend 
from $330 to $3,000 for a Borla exhaust system. About 50 small companies in the 
U. S. make high-performance exhaust systems that they sell through specialty 
auto parts shops and the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla and its competition have thrived, independent experts say, because the 
exhaust system "is the cheapest, most effective way to get a rear-wheel 
horsepower increase in any kind of vehicle," said Dick Gazan, owner of Spectra 
Racing & Engine Development in San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sherman, a Huntington Beach racing-engine builder, said he uses less 
expensive exhaust systems that "perform as good or better" than the Borla 
models, but credits Borla with offering a quality product. "He makes everything 
out of stainless steel. Right away the price goes up," Sherman said. "But it 
should last about three times as long. You might say he has the Cadillac line 
of mufflers." 
</P>
<P>
 Borla Industries and its Japanese distributor, Startline Inc., hope to offer 
exhaust systems for the American vehicles most popular in Japan, including 
Camaros, Firebirds, Jeep Cherokees and Chevrolet Astro vans. "The Japanese are 
. . . heavily into the American auto scene so they want American parts on their 
cars and motorcycles," Borla said. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet Japan's emissions laws and other requirements, Borla recently became 
the first company based outside Japan to join the Japan Automotive Sports 
Muffler Assn. On his trip to Japan last month, Borla said he met with U. S. 
Ambassador Walter F. Mondale, who complimented him on working his way into the 
Japanese market. "He was very interested in how we became successful in Japan 
and interested in using the same formula to help other companies," Borla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla said that within five years, Europe and Asia, which now account for 10% 
of his company's sales, will increase to 25%. With the expansion into Japan, 
his goal is $600,000 in foreign sales in 1994. The company sells currently in 
Australia, England, Canada, Germany and New Zealand, the Arab Emirates, Brunei, 
Holland and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Borla's mufflers stand out? "You can take any of our mufflers and 
look right through it," he said. "Other mufflers have baffles -- or what I call 
'mazes and rat traps.' The hot exhaust gasses have to go all over the place," 
which diminishes engine power. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla has two patents and a third pending for a combination muffler and 
catalytic converter that enhances performance and reduces emissions. A big auto 
maker, Borla claims, has expressed interest in utilizing the technology under 
license for its exhaust systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a fast, agile set of wheels has always been a priority for Borla, a 
Romanian immigrant who was fascinated with autos as a teen-ager. In 1976 he 
started a New York company that made replacement exhaust systems for Rolls 
Royces and Bentleys. But his heart remained with sports cars and racing. "I got 
bored with the stodgy, old people who owned Rolls Royces. I wanted to get 
involved in performance vehicles," Borla said. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold the East Coast operation and moved across country, leased space and, 
starting with $7,000 and 10 new employees, opened his company in 1983. Over the 
years he got publicity by developing exhaust systems for the auto makers' 
"concept cars" exhibited at auto shows. He also advertises in about 30 auto 
magazines, including Car and Driver, Road & Track and Motor Trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla offers exhaust components for about 200 vehicles, from exotic Ferraris 
and Lamborghinis to more subdued Chevrolet Suburbans. When Borla started, he 
was in the highbrow Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche market. But he saw that the 
money was in volume, so he shifted the product line to the larger American 
market and started making exhaust equipment for Corvettes and full-size pickup 
trucks. Today his list prices range from $332 for a Chrysler Eagle Talon 
exhaust system to $3,048 for a Lamborghini Diablo. 
</P>
<P>
 "European cars have gotten so expensive. You can go out and buy a $20,000 
American car and blow away an $80,000 Mercedes," said Borla, who drives a 1993 
Ford Mustang Cobra equipped, naturally, with Borla mufflers. By the time he's 
through tweaking and adding a supercharger, he figures he'll have about 450 
horsepower under the hood. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall the company, which now has 50 workers, moved to a five-acre site 
that will include an emissions lab, an 1/8-mile drag strip, a slalom course and 
a skid pad to test cars fitted with Borla mufflers  
</P>
<P>
 To diversify, the company plans to eventually sell a turbocharging system for 
Harley Davidsons in Japan. But Borla's growth has been fueled by aggressive 
marketing. Sales of the company's mufflers and exhaust systems, which he said 
are available as dealer-installed options at Ford dealers nationwide this year, 
could produce another $800,000 in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We equipped some Ford pickup trucks which needed more power for towing. Going 
up a grade the trucks, towing a 15,000 pound load, could only go about 55 
m.p.h. With the exhaust system they can go 65 to 68 m.p.h.," Borla said. His 
company also has a deal to supply replacement exhaust systems for the United 
Parcel Service's local fleet of delivery trucks.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: 2 SIMI FIRMS RUSH TO KEEP BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Simi Valley businesses have acted quickly to maintain their operations 
without interruption, despite severe earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 One firm, First Interstate Bank, chartered a fleet of buses to carry more than 
500 employees of the bank's credit card center to Downtown Los Angeles 
daily.The three-story building that formerly housed the center has been closed 
indefinitely, 
</P>
<P>
 "It was critical that the operation continue without interruption," said First 
Interstate spokesman Rich Wyler. "All customer service, posting and billing for 
our statewide Visa and MasterCard programs was done from that building." 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate, California's third-largest bank, rented five buses to carry 
two shifts of workers back and forth to Los Angeles daily. By the end of this 
week, the bank expects to have temporarily relocated all 550 employees who 
worked in the Simi Valley building. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyler said bank officials will wait for engineering reports before scheduling 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to structural damage, the 180,000-square-foot facility suffered 
extensive water damage from broken lines, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another company, Advanced Compression Technology Inc., a producer of 
integrated communications systems, moved all 55 of its employees and all its 
equipment and supplies to Camarillo within three days of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's headquarters building on Cochran Street in Simi Valley was made 
uninhabitable, reported spokeswoman Marilyn F. Marme. "The walls were tilted 
outward, the ceiling was down and there was water throughout the plant," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marme said Advanced has already started shipping products from its new 
location on Flynn Street in Camarillo.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: FOOTHILL GROUP'S PROFITS FOR 4TH QUARTER SURGE 34% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Foothill Group, a financial services firm with headquarters in Agoura 
Hills and Los Angeles, said its fourth-quarter profit surged 34% to $3.53 
million, from $2.64 million a year earlier.The profit came despite a loss of 
$1.24 million from its thrift subsidiary, which Foothill spun off to its 
shareholders in December. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, the Foothill Group's profit climbed 55% to $18.7 million, 
from $12.1 million for 1992. Foothill attributed the better results to 
improvements in interest margins, growth of its asset-based loan portfolio and 
robust money management activities. Foothill said that at the end of 1993, it 
had total assets owned or under management of more than $1.1 billion.
