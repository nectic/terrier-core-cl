 CASHLESS: What do Washington and Los Angeles have in common besides a lot of 
hot air? Both were awarded $20-million federal grants to improve services for 
the homeless. But the San Fernando Valley's share of the local windfall will be 
only about $600,000, or 3%, above. . . . To reduce "visible homeless," most 
funds will be spent in a 60-square-mile area covering Skid Row, South-Central 
and East L.A. -- which have the heaviest concentration of local homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 POOR WITH US: Although their presence is not as obvious as it is in other 
parts of L.A., about 3,500 to 6,000 homeless men, women and children live in 
the Valley -- many in cars -- social service providers estimate. . . . About 
10% of Valley residents receive some form of welfare, ranging from medical aid 
to income maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 WINTER'S CHILL: Feeling the cold at night? Try sleeping outdoors. The Valley's 
cold-weather shelter for the homeless has opened only a few nights since the 
program began Nov. 14. That's because the decision whether it's cold enough to 
open the 155-bed shelter at the National Guard Armory in Van Nuys is made at 10 
a.m. -- and weather forecasts can be wrong. . . . Officials say they have too 
little in federal funds to open the shelter more often. 
</P>
<P>
 HELP ON WAY: Beginning Dec. 13, the Valley's cold-weather homeless shelter 
will be open every night through Feb. 28. L.A. Family Housing Corp. runs 
shuttle buses that pick up the homeless at several Valley locations. . . . The 
county's cold-weather shelter hot line can be reached by calling (800) 
548-6047. 
</P>
<P>
 NO BACKLASH: Unlike charities in some other areas, Valley agencies say that 
anti-illegal immigrant feelings spawned by Proposition 187 have not had a 
significant impact -- yet. As crucial holiday fund-raising drives begin, 
officials are hoping that local donors will not follow the example of some 
Orange County residents, who specified that their gifts go to legal residents 
or non-Latinos only. Homeless Grant

 ANIMAL VOTE: Pondering a visit to the zoo? If you live in zoo-less Ventura 
County and want to see exotic creatures on display, get ready for a trek to 
Santa Barbara, Los Angeles or San Diego. . . . On Tuesday, however, the Board 
of Supervisors will consider a proposal by a group of Los Angeles investors to 
build a zoo for endangered species in the east county (B5). The supervisors 
will also consider proposals for two golf courses. . . . For some residents, 
the concept of an endangered-species zoo sounds a bit like another former 
landmark: Jungleland. 
</P>
<P>
 FENCED OUT: A park is a terrible thing to waste. . . . At least that's the 
feeling of some Camarillo residents, upset about limited access to the new 
Woodcreek Park (B1). . . . Park officials say an agreement with the developer 
who built the park adjoining the new Woodcreek School called for "shared 
access" of the five-acre field. . . . Perhaps accustomed to teaching lessons 
about sharing, school officials say the agreement helped make the park a 
reality. "We thought it would be win-win for everyone," official Howard 
Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 GIFT OF GAB: What's scarier -- making a speech before a big crowd, or dying? 
Given a choice, some say they'd prefer death. . . . Helping speakers overcome 
such fears is where Toastmasters International comes in (B4). Members get a 
safe place to work through their phobias and master the art of talking to big 
groups of strangers. . . . "We learn to be comfortable here so we can be 
comfortable anywhere," said Jim Graham, a Toastmaster in one of six Conejo 
Valley chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 EXPANDING HORIZONS: Saturday marked the 26th anniversary of the annexation of 
the Pierpont Bay area to the city of Ventura. . . . The beachfront area 
encompassing a stretch of San Buenaventura State Beach north of Marina Park 
officially became part of the city Dec. 3, 1968. . . . The city's most recent 
expansion was the Cabrillo Village annexation. The 32-acre area became a part 
of the city in June.

GEORGE RAMOS: AN EDUCATOR'S LESSON FOR THE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darline Robles figured she'd spend her entire life in Montebello. She grew up 
there, went to school there, decided she wanted to be a teacher there and got 
her first classroom job there. After she got married, Robles and husband Frank 
knew there was only one town to live in. Eventually, her mother moved in next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed appropriate when Robles became the superintendent of the local 
school district in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd be here for life," she remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 All that's changed now. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, the 44-year-old Robles leaves home to become the superintendent of 
schools in Salt Lake City. The job pays less than the one in Montebello and 
it's in a part of the country that some Chicano activists might think is 
inhospitable to them. The good folks in Montebello begged the hometown girl to 
stay, but in the end she decided she wanted to go to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a place like Montebello, the reasons for moving on can range from the 
small-town political intrigue to wanting to spread one's wings to try something 
different. There was a little bit of that when Robles talked about her reasons 
for leaving the other morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main reason for saying adios to Montebello was her sense that 
California and her hometown aren't aggressively fighting for public education. 
</P>
<P>
 To her, we're no longer "ahead of the curve," seeking innovative ways to 
educate the diversity of kids in schools today. We're reacting to problems, not 
anticipating them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people who support public education have gotten . . . a little 
apathetic about it," she explained. "They probably think it'll take care of 
itself because it's the right thing to do. We need to be risk-takers. To me, if 
I'm just a teacher, I'm defending the status quo. The needs are so great now 
for our kids that you can't afford to be a regular educator. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta be a social engineer . . . putting your neck on the line for the 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 I stopped Robles right there, questioning whether her new employers in Utah 
knew that Robles, a product of the Chicano movement, was espousing something 
different than the three Rs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep up the enthusiasm for public education," she countered, 
explaining that innovative ideas can counter the blase attitude that seems to 
have set in among some public education advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 In Montebello, where nearly 89% of the 31,000 students are Latinos, Robles 
contended that support seems to be dwindling for the programs, such as 
bilingual education, that are intended to put some students on par with others 
who are fluent English-speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't make apologies for such programs, explaining that they work. The 
fact that she's Chicano has nothing to do with it. "I work for all kids," she 
said. "In Montebello, these programs have worked. They can work elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 And in Salt Lake City, where Latinos make up only 18% of the surprisingly 
small 25,000-pupil enrollment, such programs would be ahead of the curve. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles said another reason for leaving was her sense that L.A.'s power elite 
isn't fully behind public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh sure, the corporation captains of L.A. say the right things and 
occasionally do the right things. But she said they don't willingly give up 
their own time on behalf of public education. Too often, it seems the bigwigs 
delegate the investment of time to others who don't carry the influence their 
bosses do. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they do something, it's always on their terms," she said. "There's no 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Robles said that on a recent visit to Salt Lake City, she was shocked to learn 
that the top editor of one of the town's newspapers donates an hour a week to 
tutor kids. She was impressed by that newspaperman, knowing full well that such 
a commitment would be tough to equal in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are other reasons for concern about public education in California -- 
dwindling state monies and that proposition. But Robles doesn't intend her 
comments to be an indictment of home. It's more of a wake-up call to L.A. to do 
the right thing about public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let people know who we really are," she said. "We are a beautiful community, 
but the impression is that we're not. I think we are. We just don't let enough 
people know that. We can't go by other people's view of us. We need to be 
holding our heads up high. . . . We need not to be passive. We need to get that 
voice heard, and not hear what (other) voices say about us. We need to get the 
word out." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of our talk, Robles sounded like someone already set to come home.

 Several statements made by Samuel Aborne -- the business manager for The 
Shamrock, John F. Kennedy High School's student publication -- in the Nov. 21 
Youth Opinion ("Our Campus Has Been Really Divided on Proposition 187") need 
clarification. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to an article concerning the use of marijuana on Kennedy's campus, 
Aborne stated that "the administration found the article objectionable" and 
"the administration got scared at the survey results."He also stated that "the 
article appeared to indicate high usage on campus." None of these statements, 
however, is founded in fact. No administrator on our campus has ever made such 
statements. Furthermore, the article did not indicate high usage of marijuana 
on Kennedy's campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Even students can and have been sued for printing false information. To claim, 
"It's my opinion," is never a justification for printing erroneous information. 
This incident served as an effective lesson in our journalism class. Hopefully, 
other journalism students will benefit as well.

SUPER-HEROES: 'IT'S LIKE A SOAP OPERA'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an age when real-life heroes seem in short supply, many kids are turning 
the pages of comic books to find role models. For some teen-agers, their 
favorite super-hero may possess characteristics that mirror their own traits or 
represent a persona that they hope to achieve. JACQUELINE MAJERS, an editor for 
the Los Angeles-based youth magazine Mouth2Mouth, asked some young people at 
comic book stores around Southern California about their favorit e characters .

 Super-hero: Prime  
</P>
<P>
 Size of collection: 300-plus  
</P>
<P>
 Prime is a 13 year old kid who becomes a big Superman-like guy, with all the 
muscles. I can identify with him because at first he's this wimpy little guy, 
Kevin Green, then he transforms into Prime. He got his powers at birth because 
this weird doctor was doing experiments on his mom. He was captured by this 
government guy, who had him in manacles and shot electric shocks through him. 
Then this hero, Firearm, rescued him and transformed him into a new Prime, with 
chains and an earring. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of my friends do comics. But I don't know any girls who collect. Girls 
go, "Wow, what a nerd, he collects comics." BOAZ HEPNER

</P>
<P>
 Super-hero: Batman  
</P>
<P>
 Size of collection: 250-plus  
</P>
<P>
 Batman's a pretty normal guy who works his way up in life with no special 
talents. He reached the same status as super-heroes without being born with it. 
He has no powers, but has the potential of doing almost the same things as the 
other super-heroes with only the human body. Batman creates his own weapons and 
his own defense. The only person who he would have help him is Robin. And he 
trained Robin himself. Batman has to use his brain more. He is his own man.  
</P>
<P>
 I can't look up to someone who has powers. Take Superman: His personality is 
admirable, but if he lost his powers he wouldn't get very far. ROBBIE HAMADA 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Super-hero: The Wildcats  
</P>
<P>
 Size of collection: 1000-plus  
</P>
<P>
 These two alien races were fighting in outer space, crashed into Earth and 
mixed in with the population. The bad aliens, called Daemonites, try to take 
over the Earth, so the good aliens, the Wildcats, have to stop them. There are 
six Wildcats and thousands of bad aliens. They are a very secret team. Nobody, 
including the other super-heroes, knows about them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my favorite Wildcats is Vealot. She's a Coda, a group of people who 
study martial arts. She is so disciplined, a perfectionist. I'm really sloppy 
and forget things. If I were a Vealot, I'd at least have homework done. Vealot 
would probably have A homework. I have B or C homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Comics have to be drawn good. It could be a pretty good character but not 
drawn good and I wouldn't like it. For instance, Warblade's got a ponytail, all 
these coils from his stomach, and his hands are blades. Ponytails on guys are 
better in comics; I would never have one. ANGELO EAMES 
</P>

<P>
 Super-hero: Spawn  
</P>
<P>
 Size of collection: 250-plus  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I like the art and it's a good story line. Spawn is this demon superhero. He 
was a military assassin and was killed. He made a deal with the devil: The 
devil got his soul so he could come back to the world again, five years later, 
to see his wife. He has a whole lot of powers and he can pretty much do 
whatever he wants.  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of super-heroes, like Batman or Superman, are really rich and live in 
big mansions. Spawn, on the other hand, is a bum. He lives in an alley with a 
bunch of other bums. It's different. In a lot of comic books, the characters 
are just running around, getting the bad guy, killing people, doing super-hero 
stuff like that. But I like Spawn because the character has more of a 
personality. There's a little humor in it. CRYSTAL BASALDUA

<P>
 Super-hero: Rogue  
</P>
<P>
 Size of collection: 2,200 for family Rogue is a friendly country girl from the 
South. She is a mutant with the ability to absorb the memories and powers of 
anyone she has flesh-to-flesh contact with. She can't touch anyone for very 
long or she becomes a part of that other being. As a child, her father kicked 
her out. She wandered for a while until she met the doctor that takes care of 
the X-Men (super-heros). 
</P>
<P>
 I like her personality. She gets along with everyone. I feel sorry for her 
because she afraid if she gets close to anyone, she'll drain everything from 
them. Guys can become unconscious, depending on how long she touches them. Her 
first kiss put the boy in a coma and he's still unconscious. She can't even 
hold hands and her suit must completely cover her body because of how strong 
her powers are. 
</P>
<P>
 I hang with a bunch of girls and we all talk about comic books. It's like a 
soap opera.

 What do young people see as their landmarks? The Getty Conservation Institute 
in West Los Angeles asked that question in 1992.It got answers by loaning 
cameras to a group of ethnically diverse teen-agers who recorded places they 
found important. Their fresh, affecting images, including those at right, will 
be displayed starting Wednesday at the Henry P. Rio Bridge Gallery in Los 
Angeles City Hall. The show ends Jan. 6.

'PROP. 187 TOUGH TALK IS FLUFF TALK'; PORTRAYING UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AS ETHNIC 
BOGYMEN WON'T LAST BECAUSE THEIR ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS CRUCIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ERNESTO SILVA-VALDIVIA, Ernesto Silva-Valdivia is a teacher at Brooklyn 
Avenue Elementary School in East Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The political polls at the end of spring indicated that Gov. Pete Wilson was 
behind in popularity. So he turned to an old friend, the undocumented 
immigrant, to secure his reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us who live and work in the barrios recognized Wilson's cynical 
motives when he charged out to support Proposition 187. Wilson and his 
politician friends found a scapegoat for California's deteriorating schools, 
soaring medical costs and economic insecurity. The main supporters of 
Proposition 187 would have you believe that its implementation will drive 
undocumented immigrants out of the state and release California citizens from a 
heavy financial burden. 
</P>
<P>
 But the immigrant and the business person know that they need each other, 
regardless of what state and federal laws, county codes and city ordinances 
say. Most Latinos would acknowledge that many California business people -- 
restaurant owners, manufacturers, contractors, hotel and office building 
owners, landscapers, ranchers and farmers -- cannot economically prosper 
without cheap labor. The immigrant comes to work for the bosses' profit and 
convenience in return for, he hopes, just wages and decent treatment. Bosses 
get workers who have the necessary skills at the right cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 will not change the economic basis of that unspoken contract. 
This year's vicious attacks on immigrants will be forgotten when the next 
harvest arrives, or when another tract of desert needs to be developed for 
housing, or when the order arrives for the spring season in women's fashions, 
or when the next convention of professionals arrive to use a hotel's services 
and rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 History bears this out. The massive Depression-era deportations of Mexican 
immigrants didn't stop people from later returning and settling in California 
when the political climate improved. Despite negative campaigns against 
"Okies," Chinese railroad workers or whatever ethnic bogyman is in vogue, the 
demand for decent wages and jobs has matched the demand for qualified cheap 
labor throughout California's history. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember playing the barrio version of tag, La Migra, as a kid with my 
brother and sister and neighbors. One of our playmates would take the role of 
an Immigration and Naturalization Service officer. The rest of us would play 
ourselves, immigrants. The object of the game was to escape capture. 
</P>
<P>
 When the "officer" yelled "Migra!" everyone ran and hid. As the migra officer 
approached, the "immigrants" would twist and turn like contortionists on roller 
skates. Everyone, including the migra officer, laughed with delirium. When the 
game was over, we shed the roles and reverted to friends. Perhaps California 
entrepreneurs do not rub elbows in the same neighborhoods, schools, churches or 
night clubs with the immigrant. Perhaps we cannot call each other friends. But 
our relationship is friendly. Certainly we roll up our sleeves together at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the entrepreneur and the immigrant can chuckle, knowing that the 
politicians were only playing a make-believe game of chase for the television 
cameras and unsuspecting voters. Years from now, we can share anecdotes that 
the politicians' tough talk was only fluff talk and that only the uninitiated 
or naive would believe the Proposition 187 rhetoric.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Having gone to considerable lengths to stress serious concerns regarding 
trail-safety issues, I was most disappointed to see our most pertinent argument 
was edited from my statement in the Nov. 14 In the Neighborhood ("Arroyo Seco: 
Whose Needs Come First?") 
</P>
<P>
 Although we are by no means the only folks to object to changing the standing 
ordinance (restricting bikes on trails), we are the group that would be most 
severely impacted by the very real danger of serious accidents that can -- and 
have -- occurred with the advent of bicycles onto hiking/bridle trails.

 We love the Voices page with views of people from every walk of life. But the 
Nov. 14 Multicultural Manners, "Shoeless Salesman Lands on His Feet," about not 
jumping to conclusions about everyone whose ancestors came from a certain 
continental area like Asia, really struck me. What everyone should rely on is 
their own sense of fairness, consideration of others' feelings and compassion 
for the situation of others -- in short, plain good manners, not 
"multicultural" manners.

SANTEE ALLEY: A THRIVING LESSON IN REVITALIZATION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Revitalizing downtown Los Angeles may seem a daunting task. But all it took 
for two-block-long Santee Alley to become an economic engine for the center 
city was an enterprising wholesale merchant in the garment district, who one 
day in the late 1970s stuck a rack of clothes out the back door. A shopping 
bazaar was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of smaller stores can pay cash and buy small quantities, rather than 
establishing credit and waiting weeks for merchandise from the nearby apparel 
marts. Many wholesale tenants for blocks around now sublet space in front of 
their warehouses to sell retail. And despite the recession, construction is 
booming in the garment district. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson is that not all revitalization can be planned to the letter. 
Wonderful things often happen spontaneously. FREDDIE SHAHAMFAR

<P>
 People come here looking for a good deal. It's very competitive. You put a new 
dress design in a showcase and you will probably see it by the next week, 
either in the alley or other streets around here. 
</P>
<P>
 Most business owners in the alley now are Persian, with some Koreans, a few 
Chinese and others. I was born in Iran and my family came to the U.S. in 1983 
when I was 11 and the war was still going on. The shoppers are mostly Spanish, 
and tourists come from all over the world. PEDRO RODRIGUEZ

<P>
 I come here every month to buy clothes to sell in El Paso and Juarez (Mexico). 
I don't have a store -- I sell person-to-person. Some customers tell me before 
I come what they want, what color and what brand. I buy men's and women's 
clothing, T-shirts, pants, dresses, hats, watches -- at least $1,000 to $3,000 
per trip. I travel by bus, which takes about 14 hours and is cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is growing more in business because a lot of Mexicans and Latin 
Americans buy here. We have an opportunity to get good things here.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SECOND OPINION / 
OTHER MEDIA; QUESTIONING THE ISLAMIC STATUS QUO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Muslim world, with rare exceptions, has lain dormant for hundreds of 
years. Like the changes that took place during Rip Van Winkle's nap, the world 
has changed considerably since the Golden Age of Islam. It is because of this 
change that we, as Muslims, can no longer afford to make blanket statements 
about identity, law and norms. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking questions is an indication of an attempt to distance ourselves from 
harmful cultural practices that have invaded Islam, and through time, become 
synonymous with it. Whether it is the inhumane practice of female circumcision, 
the tolerance of tyrants as representatives of Muslim countries or the 
anti-intellectual attitude proudly exhibited by many Muslim countries, it is 
clear that holding these things open to examination is a healthy process. 
Questioning the status quo, as well as ideas or practices that are incorrectly 
considered Islamic, are not signs of heresy, but of piety. It is notable that 
the biggest "troublemakers" were the prophets, who were persecuted for calling 
to question the long-standing traditions of their forefathers. Perhaps we 
should do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be premature to discuss direction or goals on a community level before 
addressing the same questions on an individual level. Before we can ask, "who 
are we," we must ask, "who am I?" Each individual (. . .) must ask the 
implications of being a Muslim in America. The possibility of achieving an 
Islamic identity independent of culture is real. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the unique opportunities we have as Muslims in America, we need to 
be aware of the negative trends in "Americanizing" Islam. Whether it is the 
now-common corporate structure and bureaucracy of many (mosques) or the ugly 
tinges of racism creeping into these "homes of Allah," it is critical that we 
don't accept the negative realities in this society as our realities. 
</P>
<P>
 If we don't define ourselves and Islam, others will gladly do it for us. Our 
struggles in Bosnia, Palestine, Kashmir, south Asia and South-Central are 
evidence of the fear that special-interest groups manufacture about Islam.  
</P>
<P>
 Who am I, and who are we? Unless we ask the questions, others will give the 
responses. 
</P>
<P>

Muslim newspaper published at UCLA.

AZUSA: TURNING COLLEGE DREAMS INTO PRACTICAL GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Azusa, a predominantly Latino community east of Pasadena, many children 
come from families with little formal education; for them, college may seem a 
far-fetched dream. Two years ago, the city's only college, Azusa Pacific 
University, launched a program called College Headed and Mighty Proud (CHAMP) 
to introduce fourth-graders to the possibility of attending college. The 
private liberal arts university works with the Azusa Unified School District to 
incorporate into the curriculum a seven-week lesson that eschews inspirational 
speeches for a hands-on simulation of going to college. The goal is to expose 
children to a substantial college-oriented experience that involves families as 
well. One elementary school participated when the program began in February, 
1992. This year 240 fourth graders at four elementary schools will participate. 
Azusa at a Glance

WEEKS 1-3: ADMISSION AND PREPARATION 
</P>
<P>
 In two visits to fourth-grade classes, university students talk about college 
academic and social life. They distribute mock university applications, housing 
surveys and financial aid forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers help students complete and submit forms and build class projects 
about going to college and mapping a course of study. In one assignment 
students choose classes they will attend when they visit the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 University admissions and financial aid officers visit classrooms to deliver 
acceptance letters and financial aid awards and help plan the university visit. 
WEEK 4: CAMPUS VISIT 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-graders are matched with college-student buddies who escort them for 
the day and stay in touch after their visit. Here's what some Lee Elementary 
School students did: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Register 
</P>
<P>
 2) Take a Tour 
</P>
<P>
 3) Attend Class 
</P>
<P>
 4) Eat Lunch 
</P>
<P>
 5) Work Out WEEKS 5-7: COMMENCEMENT AND FOLLOW-UP 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-graders return to campus with their families for a formal "graduation" 
with speakers, diplomas, a slide show chronicling their college visit and a 
free lifetime pass to university athletic events for each family. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers help fourth-graders write thank-you notes to their buddies and create 
other art and writing projects based on their experience.  
</P>
<P>
 Participants receive letters from buddies and birthday cards each year. 
Families receive an annual newsletter from the university.

 "Fourth-graders usually haven't made a lot of decisions about who they are or 
are going to be. Later, peers become much more important and if there's a group 
who don't believe in college, that can create a distraction for those who want 
to set their sights on college. Fourth grade is a pivotal time developmentally 
because the children are highly impressionable." -- Bev Gonzales, Fourth-grade 
teacher at Azusa's Valleydale elementary school; organized the CHAMP program

COMPUTERIZED VOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julia H. Rahhal asks in her letter (Nov. 28) why paper ballots are used in 
California unlike voting machines common in many other states. Many California 
jurisdictions once used voting machines to conduct elections but these systems 
lost favor to paper-based alternatives.The reasons included cost savings, large 
numbers of candidates and measures which exceeded voting machine capacities, 
vote-by-mail usage requiring parallel processing systems and the lack of an 
effective audit trail to verify voter intent. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for California to move beyond the paper ballot to touch-screen, 
computerized voting. The voter would simply indicate choices by touching the 
screen. In order to provide an audit trail, the computer would produce a paper 
printout allowing the voter to verify choices. The printout would then be 
deposited in a "ballot box" for audit purposes. A pilot project in 1996 
experimenting with the system would be a good way to prepare California's 
elections for the 21st Century.

 "Cooperation builds barns; competition burns them down" is something my

</P>
<P>
 It is ever more evident as time goes by that it is more than barns that suffer 
from excessive competition. How many more poor people must live on the streets 
of America before we get the idea? In this disposable society, must we have 
"chuck-away" children?

 The trend in America toward "lean and mean" and many other excessive

 Re "Huffington Holds Out for Unlikely Victory in Race," Nov. 29: 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Huffington claims that Sen. Dianne Feinstein's victory rests on 
"overwhelming" fraud perpetuated by opponents of Proposition 187. I believe 
that an elected official should have a great deal of solid evidence before he 
levels a charge of voting fraud in the United States.Beyond that, though, if 
the opponents of 187 had committed fraud on such a "massive" scale, why did 
Proposition 187 itself pass? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I believe the charge of "widespread voter fraud" by Huffington and others 
should be taken a little more seriously. My wife and I recently moved to Los 
Angeles from New York. Since we missed the absentee ballot deadline to vote in 
New York and had not registered out here, we gave up hope in participating in 
Election Day '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Lo and behold, while walking to buy milk Nov. 8, we passed the neighborhood 
polling place and ventured inside ostensibly to register for the 1995 election. 
We were told that we could vote "right now." No questions asked. No documents 
requested. We were amazed. We filled out our envelope, signed it and proceeded 
to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightening. I could have been a 17-year-old illegal alien with a felony 
conviction and no one would have noticed.

 Now Huffington's privately financed army of volunteers will be going door to

How do we get rid of this guy?

CHARTER SCHOOLS: GAIN AND PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charter schools -- public schools that operate with greater autonomy under 
individual "charters," free of many state and district rules -- are an 
important education experiment allowed under a 1992 state law. Offering the 
freedom to tailor a school environment to the needs of the students, charters 
have spawned great success stories. Witness Vaughn Street school in the San 
Fernando Valley, which boasted a surplus of more than $1 million after just one 
year of operation, and Westwood in West Los Angeles, where parents recently 
camped out in the wee hours in order to sign their kids up for the 1995-96 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 But experiments, by definition, are test cases, and there can be no chance for 
unbridled success without the risk of failure. And that brings us to Edutrain, 
the first charter school in the Los Angeles Unified School District at risk to 
be shut down. The school administrator -- no longer in charge -- demonstrated 
flagrant judgment, driving an expensive, school-leased car and spending 
lavishly for graduation ceremonies and staff retreats. There's now a debt of 
about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAUSD board will meet today to discuss Edutrain's future. This comes on 
the heels of a major embarrassment: Fraud indictments were handed down Friday 
against operators of another school dropout program that allegedly bilked more 
than $700,000 from the district. Those indictments -- and the looming fear that 
a more conservative state Legislature will reconsider breaking up the LAUSD -- 
heighten the political pressure on the board to demonstrate that it doesn't 
take mismanagement lightly. But in their zeal to show they're tough 
administrators, board members must not forget the most important element here, 
the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain was established in 1993 to serve the needs of some of the district's 
most troubled dropout students. Fifteen percent of Edutrain students are on 
parole and at least 85% have arrest records. The district's other nine charter 
schools attract highly motivated students, typically with parents deeply 
involved in their children's lives at home and at school. Those watchful 
parents provide much of the steam that drives the success at charter schools. 
That steam wasn't there for Edutrain kids. Another missing element was proper 
oversight from the prestigious but lax governing board of the school. And the 
LAUSD, which must approve charter schools before they can begin operation, was 
slow to help address earlier complaints about school mismanagement. There's 
plenty of blame to go around for Edutrain's serious problems.  
</P>
<P>
 The school board should now hold Edutrain strictly accountable, by imposing a 
hard and short deadline for improvement, a time in which proper record-keeping, 
administration and student accomplishment must be clearly, publicly 
demonstrated. It's the kids who deserve a second chance.

NEW HOPE IN MEXICO AFTER A TURBULENT YEAR; PRESIDENT ZEDILLO IS OFF TO AN 
IMPRESSIVE START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This has been a tumultuous -- although historic -- year in Mexico, and more 
turmoil may be coming yet. That's one reason it was reassuring to see Ernesto 
Zedillo inaugurated last week as president in a largely peaceful process that 
almost seemed anticlimactic, given all that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
 As 1994 approached, Mexico prepared to celebrate both the new year and the 
nation's formal entry into the North American Free Trade Agreement with the 
United States and Canada; then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had boosted 
that monumental pact as his country's ticket to First World prosperity. Yet on 
New Year's Day Mexicans awakened to a jolt that reminded them that millions of 
their countrymen remain trapped in the Third World: an Indian uprising in 
Chiapas that remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, things got worse. In March the country was stunned by its 
first major political assassination in years -- the murder of the leading 
candidate to succeed Salinas as president, Luis Donaldo Colosio of the powerful 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Colosio's killer was captured at the scene, the shooting hangs as a 
question in the minds of many Mexicans. Was the killer a deranged loner or a 
puppet in some larger plot? The ongoing speculation was fueled in September 
when PRI Secretary General Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu also was gunned down by 
an assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 But in looking back on these events and other worrisome developments, such as 
a resurgence of drug violence and kidnapings for ransom, all would do well to 
also recall how Mexico kept moving forward in 1994 despite its traumas. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly noteworthy was the fact that in August the nation was able to 
conduct its most open and honest elections in a century -- voting in which 
Zedillo, a 42-year-old economist who had been Colosio's campaign manager, was 
elected. It is hard to envision an event that could be more reassuring to 
foreign investors worried that political turmoil could somehow stall the 
remarkable economic reforms, such as NAFTA, that Salinas began during his 
six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the former president, Zedillo is an Ivy League-trained technocrat more 
skilled at financial numbers-crunching than political glad-handing. And the key 
financial posts in Zedillo's Cabinet are manned by holdovers from the Salinas 
years, including Treasury Secretary Jaime Serra Puche and Commerce Secretary 
Herminio Blanco. Even Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria is a noted financial 
expert. Clearly Zedillo will stay the economic course. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Zedillo has also taken the unprecedented step of naming a member of 
the opposition National Action Party, Antonio Lozano, as his attorney general. 
If Lozano is allowed to do his job unimpeded, he could go a long way toward 
calming the fears of Mexicans that at least some of the violence that plagues 
their nation, including the political killings, stems from PRI political 
corruption paid for by drug money. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans also point with hope toward Zedillo's appointment of Arturo Warman, 
an expert on Mexico's indigenous tribes, as secretary of agriculture and 
natural resources. His expertize could help Zedillo settle the simmering Indian 
conflict in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the controversy that Salinas' economic reforms spawned, he left office 
as popular as any Mexican president in decades. Obviously Zedillo has a tough 
act to follow. But in his Cabinet appointments, Mexico's new president is off 
to an impressive start.

MINORITIES' USE OF NATIONAL PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Opening Parks to All of America" (Nov. 25), on the national park system and 
its lack of minority visitors, reinforced what I had been thinking about for 
several years now. I have visited many national parks, monuments, sites, etc., 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 And although I'm not a race-conscious person, I often notice that I am the 
only non-Anglo American on a trail, beach or at a historical site. The 
non-Anglos are usually tourists from East Asia or Latin America. The fact that 
one-quarter of blacks and Latinos are poor is one reason one does not see these 
groups. But what about the large black and Hispanic middle class, who have the 
money and the time to visit national parks? 
</P>
<P>
 People can't overlook the cultural aspect to this. From personal experience 
and observation, I know that for black and Latino families, vacation time is 
used to visit aunts, uncles, cousins and siblings. It isn't the time to go off 
to the great outdoors. Visiting national parks is only the side trip, if the 
family being visited lives near one. The idea of spending one's vacation time 
with the extended family is much stronger than the urge of going off with only 
the nuclear family on a quiet stroll through the woods or desert. This is 
something that cannot be easily changed, nor should it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Anglo-American nuclear families or couples, however, do not spend their 
vacation time with their extended families, choosing instead rather solitary 
communions with nature.

 It appears The Times delights in stirring up trouble. The parks are now and 
have always been open to any and everyone, just like attending a movie or any 
recreation of your choice. To infer any unfairness or problem, as your paper 
does, is pathetic. Next you'll want government-sponsored buses to bring certain 
groups to parks.  
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is, all Americans choose daily their lives, jobs, priorities 
and what to spend their time and/or money on. This ridiculous article could be 
applied to any area in our life, and is not only obvious but definitely not in 
need of any change. Let the public be responsible for their own choices and 
actions, and quit whining all the time.

 Anyone who thinks we need to "draw more minorities" to our national parks has 
never visited the Yosemite Valley on Labor Day or the July 4th. Spanish is the 
predominant language being spoken and the only items found in greater number 
than blaring boom boxes are empty beer cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than those guests staying at the Awahnee Hotel, the remainder of park 
visitors are far from being "white elitist." They are Generation X 
pseudo-hippies and yokels using their food stamps to buy supplies in the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, our national parks are a delightful cross-section of America. 
Let's not alter this delicate balance with more social engineering.

FOOD BANK ASSISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations go to Sonia Nazario for her thorough and insightful series 
regarding hunger in Southern California (Nov. 20-23). It's a painful and 
complex subject; she shed new light on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the series will be a reference source for some time to come, I did 
want to comment on some matters: 
</P>
<P>
 No food bank that I am aware of regularly charges handling fees for fresh 
produce and baked goods, which tend to be highly perishable and must be used 
quickly. Specifically, the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank provides nearly all 
produce free nearly all the time and all bread free all the time to all of its 
participating charities. It is not entirely accurate to state that food banks 
charge handling fees for breads and produce. The Los Angeles Regional Foodbank 
also administers a program which connects local charities with bakeries, 
supermarkets and the like in order to increase their access to free baked goods 
and other foods. 
</P>
<P>
 As to urban gardens, we are most grateful for the crucial role the Los Angeles 
Conservation Corps played in the start-up and development of the urban garden 
you describe as a crown jewel, as well as for the aid of Common Ground, in 
donations of free seeds and copious amounts of free soil amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 But this urban garden was begun with the help of Wendy Greuel of then-Mayor 
Tom Bradley's staff and has always been administered by the Los Angeles 
Regional Foodbank. The Foodbank leafleted community members to inform them of 
the garden's availability, raises money to sustain it, pays for water and a 
staff member who is the liaison between the gardeners and the Foodbank, and 
welcomes every opportunity to show others what can be done with unused, 
government-owned land in low-income communities. 
</P>
<P>
 We are grateful for the help of many community-based organizations, public 
entities and private businesses for their part in making the garden such a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have surrendered to the belief that there will always be poverty. 
Thus, they view hunger, a symptom of poverty, as a tired old issue. Nazario has 
shown that many people will not accept hunger as inevitable. Thank you for 
spotlighting many facets of the problem and the new approaches to help those 
struggling with tragic circumstances.

IRAQ SANCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article (Nov. 15) on Iraq that included reference to the effects of the 
sanctions makes me feel that the remarks by U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright 
and of an unnamed "American official" really insult the American people's 
intelligence by minimizing the Iraqi people's immense suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Assigning responsibility is not the issue -- leave that to children's 
playground quarrels.But, addressing the deadly effects on hundreds of thousands 
of ordinary citizens due to these sanctions is the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 These sanctions, as repeatedly noted by American officials, have failed. It 
must be asked: What are the functions of the sanctions? Are they to punish the 
regime or to punish the people? Clearly, they are not weakening Saddam Hussein; 
they are killing defenseless humans. We must remove them posthaste lest we 
again stand by idly over the holocaust of yet another people facing genocide.

THE REVOLUTION IN HEALTH CARE IS IN DELIVERY; REFORM: MANAGED CARE IS THE 
FUTURE AND THE SIGNS LOOK GOOD, BUT GOVERNMENT AND MEDIA MUST REMAIN VIGILANT 
ON QUALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DREW E. ALTMAN, Drew E. Altman is president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family 
Foundation, a private philanthropy that studies problems in the health system. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the next few months, the health-reform agenda for Congress will begin to 
come into focus. While comprehensive federal reform is now highly unlikely, 
there is a revolution under way in the practice of medicine in many parts of 
our country that is profound and probably unstoppable. The challenge ahead for 
government will be to decide when to step in and set the ground rules, and when 
to stay out and let the market do its thing.  
</P>
<P>
 Large managed-care plans in such disparate places as Southern California, 
Georgia and New York are now delivering care with vastly fewer hospital days, 
visits to specialists and diagnostic tests than the national averages for 
similar populations. Just one example: In the United States as a whole, 
commercially insured populations average just under 500 hospital days for every 
1,000 people; for some managed-care plans in Southern California, the average 
is under 150 hospital days per 1,000 enrollees. The differences for older 
people on Medicare are equally startling: 2,900 hospital days per 1,000 across 
the United States, as compared with less than 1,000 hospital days for some of 
these plans. It's a harbinger of the future and at least on the surface it 
appears to be getting results. Premium costs per member per month are way down 
in these plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Are these dramatic reductions in hospital care good or bad? Do they really 
save money or just skim healthier patients or shift costs to ambulatory care? 
Are people getting the care they need? The truth is that we don't know, and we 
have not really taken the steps necessary to find out. What some see as better 
coordinated, more cost-effective care, others see as "cook book" medicine and 
profiteering at the expense of sick people. 
</P>
<P>
 The year ahead will see a fierce debate in Congress about taking savings from 
Medicare and Medicaid to reduce the federal deficit. We will see the return of 
the health-reform debate, most likely in the form of incremental rather than 
sweeping proposals. And we will see an intensifying struggle between the states 
and the federal government about state health reform, with the states demanding 
federal financial participation in their reform programs and increased 
flexibility to carry them out. Those policy debates will dominate the attention 
of government and the media, but the changes occurring in health delivery 
deserve equal attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the national health-reform debate was covered by the media as a 
political rather than a people story, coverage of the changing health-care 
marketplace is usually left to the business pages, where stories emphasize the 
implications of mergers and acquisitions for investors. Much greater attention 
needs to be given by the media to how the changes occurring in the health 
delivery system are affecting people.  
</P>
<P>
 Congress and state governments need to begin to resolve a long list of tough 
questions. Do we want the nonprofit orientation of our health-care system 
replaced by an increasingly concentrated for-profit sector? Should managed-care 
plans be able to pick and choose only the doctors they feel provide the most 
cost-effective care, or should all qualified doctors be assured the right to 
practice in the plans of their choice? Should government require benefits to be 
standardized, so consumers can compare apples to apples when they buy? Should 
government require that employers offer their employees multiple choices, and 
should there always be a fee-for-service choice? Should big city public 
hospitals, community clinics and other nonprofits be afforded special 
protections so they won't lose out in the market shuffle? Should managed-care 
plans be required to take their fair share of the poor, the uninsured and the 
higher-cost chronically ill? The questions are big ones that we have barely 
begun to confront. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much that is good in the changing health system, including the 
potential for delivering much more cost-effective care. But there is also a 
need for government and the media to be the watchdog when the market goes 
wrong. Many elected officials felt they dodged a bullet when comprehensive 
reform died, but if the majority of Americans end up with a system that seems 
to them inflexible and unfair, there will be a political price to pay for those 
who failed to serve as their watchdogs.

2ND AMENDMENT: SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE; GUNS: SCHOLARLY RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE 
INTENTION TO HAVE AN ARMED CITIZENRY; IRONICALLY, THAT COULD MAKE CONTROL 
EASIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN HARLAN REYNOLDS, Glenn H. Reynolds is an associate professor of law at 
the University of Tennessee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Nov. 8 Republican victory brought with it GOP vows to emasculate landmark 
gun laws, including the Brady bill. Even if the threats prove to be only 
rhetoric, this is a good time to give the Second Amendment some serious 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
 This constitutional provision guaranteeing the right to keep and bear arms was 
until recently dismissed as obsolete by academics, pundits and policy-makers. 
Yet on examination, the Second Amendment offers answers to today's gun debate 
that are likely to please neither pro- nor anti-gun control zealots. 
</P>
<P>
 This point was made in a 1989 Yale Law Journal article by Sanford Levinson 
titled "The Embarrassing Second Amendment." Although generally considered a 
left-leaning scholar, Levinson raised tough questions about how the Second 
Amendment has been wished away. Law professors who had previously ignored the 
subject began researching and holding conferences. There isn't complete 
agreement, but the outlines of what the Second Amendment means are now clear. 
Its purpose was to ensure an armed citizenry. This wasn't to prevent crime, or 
encourage hunting, or defend the country against invasion; it was to ensure 
that the government didn't have a monopoly on force. With an armed populace, 
tyranny was thought unlikely. As Justice Joseph Story said, the right to keep 
and bear arms is "the palladium of liberties of a republic." Or, as Thomas 
Jefferson said, "The strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep 
and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether gun ownership promotes crime, the Second Amendment 
seriously limits gun control -- just as the First Amendment bars censoring 
crime reporting even though news reports sometimes promote "copycat" crimes. 
And the argument from both sides about preserving "legitimate sporting and 
hunting" misses the mark: The Second Amendment isn't about hunting ducks. Nor 
are weapons that are "only good for killing people" exempted from the Second 
Amendment's protection; they are at its core. The framers believed it was 
important for the people to have weapons that were good for killing, because 
they thought it essential for the populace to be able to defend itself against 
an oppressive government. 
</P>
<P>
 This won't please either pro- or anti-gun forces. Many gun-control opponents 
are hunters; they won't enjoy hearing that the Second Amendment is not about 
hunting. Nor is it a barrier to every kind of firearms regulation, any more 
than the First Amendment prohibits all regulation of speech. While the Second 
Amendment pretty clearly bans the sort of wholesale prohibition of firearms 
supported by some gun-control activists, it wouldn't prohibit reasonable 
regulation and licensing laws. In colonial times, all citizens were required to 
have arms and to present them for inspection once or twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the government could require citizens to show up in person for inspection, 
it's hard to argue that it can't require citizens to fill out a form. The right 
to bear arms was always limited to the law-abiding. So similar provisions would 
clearly pass muster today. Gun-control advocates, meanwhile, seem especially 
upset by private ownership of "military-style" weapons. But this is what the 
framers meant to protect: The semi-automatic assault weapons that they most 
dislike would thus be protected under the Second Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some say the Second Amendment is obsolete. But with armed citizens, 
this country has enjoyed a longer period of peace and stability than any other, 
while millions of citizens have been killed in this century by the authorities 
in European nations often held up as models of civilization by gun controllers. 
Had the millions of Jews and Gypsies annihilated by Nazis possessed weapons, 
their fate might have been different. Today, from Bosnia, to Cambodia, to Tian 
An Men Square, the enslavement or annihilation of the weak by the strong seems 
the rule, not the exception, and there is no reason that this country will 
always be immune. 
</P>
<P>
 Could armed citizens resist a tyrannical government now? True, modern armies 
have tanks and helicopters and civilians don't, but from Vietnam, to Lebanon, 
to Afghanistan, modern armies have consistently lost to armed civilians. So the 
role of an armed citizenry may not be obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, if we take the Second Amendment seriously it may actually make 
some gun controls easier. So far (as November's elections proved), barriers to 
gun control have been political, not constitutional. And opponents have been 
energized by their well-founded fear that many gun-control advocates want to 
outlaw guns completely. If the Supreme Court explicitly recognizes the right to 
keep and bear arms, fear of confiscation might go away, and reasonable 
regulations -- those that would disarm criminals, not honest citizens -- might 
fare better. 
</P>
<P>
 What's missing in today's polarized debate is trust. Gun-control advocates 
portray gun owners as depraved merely because they own guns; gun owners oppose 
any form of control because they see it as a step toward confiscation. Strong 
recognition of the right to bear arms might heal this breach and let us do 
something constructive.

PERSPECTIVE ON HUMAN RIGHTS; PATIENCE WORKS BETTER THAN BLUSTER; THE WINDS OF 
CHANGE THAT FOSTER DEMOCRATIC GROWTH ALSO UNDERMINE OFFICIAL CRUSADING. A 
STRONG U.S. IS OUR BEST POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN TONELSON, Alan Tonelson is a fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute 
in Washington. A longer version of this article appears in the winter issue of 
Foreign Policy magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Bosnia to China, from Haiti to Rwanda, America's human-rights policy is a 
shambles. Not only has Washington failed to significantly ameliorate 
human-rights problems around the world; many of its efforts also have 
threatened U.S. security and economic interests and antagonized even fellow 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the standard explanations -- allegedly naive campaign promises, 
allegedly inept diplomacy -- no longer suffice. Instead, the very idea of a 
government-centered human-rights policy has become obsolete in the post-Cold 
War era -- swamped, ironically, by the very forces that only yesterday 
generated widespread American expectations of a dawning human-rights golden 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 As both liberals and conservatives saw it, America would no longer have to 
back dictators for anti-Soviet reasons. Communism's collapse would bring the 
blessings of national self-determination to numerous captive peoples. And the 
global revolutions in communications and commerce would spread democracy and 
free enterprise to even the most repressive societies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet two of the main features of the post-Cold War world are overwhelming the 
impact of any government's policies on democracy's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The first entails the so-called failed states that have been exposed by the 
Soviet collapse in Eurasia and by the end of superpower confrontation 
throughout the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 The outrages in the world's Bosnias and Somalias are usually called 
"human-rights violations," but this phrase trivializes the problem. These 
horrendous conditions reflect nothing less than a monumental struggle not over 
the issues of democratization but of basic coherence. 
</P>
<P>
 If success is achieved -- and in many places, that's a big "if" -- it will 
result overwhelmingly from developments on the level of day-to-day human life, 
from the uncontrollable impact over many decades of the countless decisions 
taken by individuals and groups that ultimately define their identities. 
Outsiders' actions can only have marginal effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The second feature explains America's problems in pressing for human rights in 
more advanced repressive countries such as China: The accelerated global 
economic and cultural interaction lying behind so much recent human-rights 
optimism is the very force that has dwarfed government human-rights policies. 
Precisely because governments, businesses and individuals can now interact so 
easily in so many different ways, government actions inevitably get lost in the 
shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 Western and American values will not be the only seeds dropped by the gales of 
commerce, information and culture blowing around the world today. But if we 
want them to spread, then we should lead from strength. We should add 
energetically to America's already vast commercial, cultural and ideological 
influence around the world, rather than replace it with legislation or 
executive orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The China issue, along with last year's controversy over NAFTA, does highlight 
one rights-related issue that demands better U.S. government policies: the 
question of how most of our work force can benefit from American trade with 
countries that repress labor rights. American workers are already exposed to 
strong competition from hundreds of millions of workers in developing countries 
who are highly educated and highly productive in the service of the world's 
leading multinational corporations. Yet they earn a fraction of American wages 
and are usually denied the right to form independent unions, bargain 
collectively or strike. Lack of labor rights is hardly the only reason for 
their success, but it can create major competitive advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other human-rights issues, labor-rights issues directly affect millions 
of Americans. But they are best seen not as human-rights issues at all, rather 
as challenges in managing interdependence -- in ensuring that the great 
integrative forces shaping the world economy enrich, not impoverish, most 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can labor-rights problems be solved by acting out the stylized morality 
plays dominating human-rights policy today -- by issuing the same voluminous 
reports detailing rights and wrongs around the world and the same somber 
condemnations of wrongdoing, or by attempts to dictate the social and economic 
priorities of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, these problems require a raft of competitiveness policies designed to 
increase U.S. economic power and leverage. Flourishing U.S. markets and 
abundant supplies of U.S. capital and technology will give other countries 
powerful incentives to conform to our labor, environmental and other standards 
voluntarily -- not as acknowledgments of American moral superiority or as acts 
of surrender, but simply as the price of access. 
</P>
<P>
 Crusading for utopian change around the world will rarely achieve the goals 
Americans set. Our best bets are measures that enable this nation to survive, 
flourish and bargain successfully in the deeply flawed world that we will 
remain stuck with for many decades to come.

STREET SMART: TOSSING CIGARETTES ON STREETS CAN MEAN FINE -- NO BUTTS ABOUT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 My biggest pet peeve is people who throw cigarette butts out car windows on 
the freeway. I'm driving along and suddenly there's a spray of sparks. It 
always surprises me. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't be surprised if it causes some accidents at night because of the 
sudden shower of sparks that come at you. 
</P>
<P>
 May Fan 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 People who toss cigarettes out of car windows are akin to litterbugs and can 
be slapped with a fine of up to $1,000 if they are caught.  
</P>
<P>
 State law prohibits anyone, driver or pedestrian, from discarding a lighted or 
unlighted cigarette on any public or private road.  
</P>
<P>
 As with any littering, the mandatory fine for the first conviction is a 
minimum of $100. A second conviction has a mandatory fine of not less than $500 
and a third conviction carries a $750 minimum fine. 
</P>
<P>
 So, does the California Highway Patrol really enforce that law? You betcha. In 
1993, CHP officers wrote 4,261 tickets for it, agency spokesman Steve Kohler 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Here in San Clemente there is a sign problem with an Interstate 5 on-ramp. The 
Avenida Pico on-ramp to northbound Interstate 5 has two signs that state the 
lanes are going to end. But both these signs are placed around a blind curve 
and are very close together at the point where the lanes merge into one.  
</P>
<P>
 One or more signs should be visible sooner on this stretch, not where the 
lanes merge. I had a sports car pass me and its right wheels were off the 
shoulder of the freeway. He was showing me he could get by me.  
</P>
<P>
 I have seen slow trucks on the on-ramp at the merging point that don't put on 
their left-turn lights until it's too late to warn the regular slow lane 
traffic. I have seen older people and inexperienced drivers caught at that 
dead-end lane.  
</P>
<P>
 How about a warning sign somewhere before, or a flashing yellow light at the 
curve? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nelson 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 Based on your letter, Caltrans engineers investigated the Avenida Pico on-ramp 
and agreed with you.  
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Caltrans has ordered a sign installed before the on-ramp curves. 
Also, it has ordered all of the existing striping to be repainted. Part of the 
problem, said agency spokeswoman Rose Orem, was the badly faded striping. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Do you have thoughts on how to spruce up the sound walls on Orange County's 
miles of freeways? Maybe your ideas could transform these nondescript concrete 
canvases into ways of attracting additional business and tourism.  
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority and Caltrans are sponsoring two 
community workshops to gather ideas on how to enhance the appearance of 
freeways and other transportation corridors. Landscaping, public art and 
alternative aesthetic designs will be explored.

 Alabama fell out of title contention Saturday after losing to Florida, 24-23, 
in the Southeastern Conference championship game. The Crimson Tide (11-1) 
dropped from third to sixth in the AP rankings, while Florida (10-1-1) rose 
from sixth to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC game was the only one involving ranked teams on the final weekend of 
the regular season. 
</P>

NCAA SOCCER; INDIANA DENIES FULLERTON ANOTHER SHOT AT THE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY GRAHAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton came up just short of its second consecutive trip to the 
NCAA soccer tournament's Final Four as Indiana scored a 2-1 quarterfinal 
victory in front of 2,716 at Bill Armstrong Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The youngsters will take it hard, but I'm a little older and can look at it 
as the end of an excellent season," Fullerton Coach Al Mistri said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, who finished 14-7-2 after overcoming a series of injuries and 
illnesses earlier in the season, almost overcame a 2-0 second-half deficit. 
Freshman midfielder Martin Palos, who scored the Titans' only goal in the 68th 
minute off a Brad Wilson cross, earlier fired a shot that hit the right post. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana Coach Jerry Yeagley said the Hoosiers (23-2) never felt their lead was 
safe against the opponent responsible for one of their two losses this season 
(3-2, in overtime, at the UCLA tournament in October). 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the strongest opponent we faced all year," Yeagley said. "They have 
a lot of very talented players, in terms of technical ability, and also do a 
lot of great combination work." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers entered the match as the tournament's top seed, with an all-time 
NCAA tournament home-field record of 32-2. Indiana also was going for its 10th 
Final Four in 19 NCAA appearances over the last 22 seasons under Yeagley. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first half, the Hoosiers went ahead in the 52nd minute when 
a cross by Jeff Bannister deflected into the net off the back of Titan defender 
Peter Lak's leg. Caleb Porter scored the second Indiana goal in the 64th 
minute.

 Determined and confident, Montana quickly encountered the reality of women's 
volleyball, West Coast style. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending national champion Long Beach State overwhelmed the Grizzlies, 15-10, 
15-6, 15-8, Sunday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament's Northwest 
Regionals before 1,757 at the Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a little bit of a different level of play for them," Long Beach 
Coach Brian Gimmillaro said. "We play a little faster and a little higher than 
they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior outside hitter Brita Schwerm led the 49ers (26-5) with a match-high 17 
kills. Senior middle blocker Traci Dahl had 12 kills and seven total blocks. 
Nichelle Burton -- the 49ers' senior All-American outside hitter and Big West 
Conference player of the year -- also played well despite being slowed by a 
sprained right ankle. She contributed 11 kills and a match-high 13 digs. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, ranked seventh in the nation and seeded second in the region, will 
be host for the regional semifinals and final this weekend.

NCAA SOCCER; NINE-MAN UCLA BATTLES ITS WAY INTO FINAL FOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trailing by a goal with 10 minutes to play and reduced to nine men after two 
players had been ejected, UCLA was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bruins seem to thrive on such situations lately and did so again 
Sunday against the College of Charleston in the NCAA quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA scored two goals, the winner by reserve Greg Vanney with 1:12 to play, to 
defeat the Cougars, 3-2, in front of 1,500 at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory propelled the Bruins (18-4) into the NCAA soccer tournament's 
Final Four for the first time since 1990, when they won the title. UCLA will 
play Indiana Friday at Davidson (N.C) College. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's game was the second consecutive playoff match in which Vanney entered 
with only 10 minutes to play and scored the winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA led, 1-0, midway through the second half when Bruin goalkeeper Chris 
Snitko was given a red card for handling the ball outside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the 72nd minute, a long Charleston throw-in went through the hands of 
backup goalkeeper Matt Reis and a Charleston player shot toward the unguarded 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin defender Frankie Hejduk intentionally caught the ball to prevent the 
goal and was ejected. Charleston's Chad Carithers scored on the subsequent 
penalty kick, and teammate Javier Vivanco gave the Cougars (19-7) the lead, 
2-1, moments later with a header. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Eddie Lewis headed in a free kick by Ante Razov to tie the match in the 
81st minute.

SMITH DUNKS BELIEF THAT WOMEN CAN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlotte Smith of North Carolina became the first woman in 10 years to dunk a 
basketball during a game Sunday, making a one-handed jam during a rout of North 
Carolina A&T. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-foot senior intercepted a pass by Samara Dobbins and went in 
uncontested.Her right wrist cleared the rim and Smith pushed the ball through 
the basket only 17 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pass was just there, and the whole time I was going out, I was focusing 
on dunking and just getting it over with," Smith said after scoring 22 points 
for the fifth-ranked Tar Heels in a 113-58 victory. "I don't know exactly what 
happened as far as gripping it. It wasn't the most convincing dunk that I've 
done, but, hey." 
</P>
<P>
 The last woman to dunk during a game was Georgeann Wells, who had two dunks 
while playing for West Virginia in 1984.

BRONCOS DEFEAT CHIEFS IN OT; ELWAY INJURED; AFC: MILLEN STEPS IN TO LEAD DENVER 
TO WINNING FIELD GOAL IN 20-17 VICTORY. BONO PLAYS IN PLACE OF MONTANA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing takes the edge off an overtime victory for the Denver Broncos as much 
as watching John Elway being helped from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 While Elway was examined for a possibly serious knee injury Sunday, backup 
Hugh Millen engineered a 41-yard drive that set up Jason Elam's 34-yard field 
goal as the Broncos defeated Kansas City, 20-17, with 2:48 left in overtime 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, injured in the fourth quarter, will be examined further today after 
being diagnosed with a sprained knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "John may have (injured knee) cartilage," said Denver Coach Wade Phillips, 
adding he had no idea how long Elway might be out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you get John Elway on the bench, it's a relief," defensive tackle 
Joe Phillips said in the gloomy dressing room of the Chiefs (7-6), whose own 
future Hall of Fame quarterback, Joe Montana, sat out the entire game with an 
injured foot. "This is a very depressing loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief cornerback Mark Collins said, "This is just about the toughest loss, 
physically and mentally, that I can remember in a nine-year career. This game 
was a game of missed opportunities by both teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Bono, the former UCLA quarterback who started in place of the injured 
Montana, connected for touchdown pass plays of 61 and 62 yards for the Chiefs, 
who have lost three of their last four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs got within 17-15 on Bono's 62-yard touchdown pass play to Willie 
Davis with 7:08 left, then forged a 17-17 tie on Bono's two-point conversion 
pass to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the winning overtime drive, Millen, a onetime Ram, scrambled for 21 yards 
on third and 17. A few minutes later, Leonard Russell's 11-yard run put the 
ball at the 16 for Elam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs had a chance to win in regulation, but Shane Dronett blocked Lin 
Elliot's 37-yard field goal attempt as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, the teams traded blunders before the Broncos (7-6) drove 41 yards 
in nine plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in overtime, Darren Mickel sacked Millen, who entered the game in the 
fourth quarter, and forced a fumble, which Phillips recovered for the Chiefs on 
the Denver 35. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chiefs, already in field-goal territory, gave it back a moment later 
when Dennis Smith recovered Marcus Allen's fumble on the 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played this game a long time and losses are all tough," Allen said. 
"There are no words of reason. You just have to keep fighting. I should have 
secured the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Allen, the Chiefs' most reliable ball-handler, Chief Coach Mary 
Schottenheimer said: "Everybody from time to time will fumble it. It's 
unfortunate for us and him, but we had an opportunity to get a field goal and 
we didn't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Bono passed to Davis for 27 yards to the Denver 23 with 28 seconds left in 
regulation, and the Chiefs let the clock run down to :02 before Elliott tried 
to win it. But the kick was low and blocked by Dronett. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono wound up 18 of 37 for 323 yards. Elway was 18 of 22 for 256 yards before 
leaving with about seven minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos, aided by three Chief penalties, had a first-and-goal on the four 
midway through the fourth quarter. But the Chiefs' second defensive stand of 
the day forced the Broncos to settle for Elam's 34-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver held the ball for more than 10 minutes on the drive, but the Chiefs 
needed only 18 seconds to answer. After the kickoff, Davis got behind the 
secondary to haul in Bono's touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he got hurt, Elway was hot. In the third quarter, he connected with 
Anthony Miller for 57 yards to set up the Broncos' second touchdown. The 
Chiefs' Dale Carter, called for pass interference despite the catch, was helped 
from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment later, from the 24, Elway connected with Shannon Sharpe on the 20. 
Dodging Collins' attempted tackle, Sharpe went into the end zone for a 14-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bono needed only four plays to move the Chiefs 76 yards. J.J. Birden had a 
44-yard reception to the Denver 32 and Allen scored from the one to make it 
14-9. His two-point conversion run failed.

BILLS GET BOUNCES, DOLPHINS TAKE FALL; AFC: AFTER TRAILING, 17-7, AT HALFTIME, 
BUFFALO COMES ALIVE BEHIND KELLY FOR A 42-31 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With their playoff hopes dimming, the Buffalo Bills took advantage of several 
lucky bounces and rallied from a 10-point halftime deficit to defeat the Miami 
Dolphins, 42-31, Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kelly threw four touchdown passes, including a 72-yarder to Don Beebe that 
ignited the comeback in the third quarter, when Buffalo outscored Miami, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Reed scored on receptions of 21 and 83 yards, and completed the first 
pass attempt of his 10-year career to set up another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they're just better than us," Miami quarterback Dan Marino said. "Every 
time they play us, they just dominate us." 
</P>
<P>
 A loss by the Bills would have pushed the four-time defending AFC champions to 
the brink of elimination from the playoff race. Instead, they overcame a 17-7 
halftime deficit to complete a season sweep of first-place Miami and tighten 
the AFC East race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game just completely turned around," Miami Coach Don Shula said. "It 
keeps them alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo is 7-6, along with New England. The Dolphins are 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami has been on the verge of ending the Bills' AFC reign several times in 
the past. But Buffalo has won 15 of 18 games against the Dolphins since 1987, 
including eight of nine at Joe Robbie Stadium -- site of this season's Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich Stadium south," Kelly said. "This was a stepping stone for us. If 
everyone does their job, there's no telling what we're capable of. Everyone 
knows what we can do. You can't count the Buffalo Bills out." 
</P>
<P>
 On a rainy night, the ball repeatedly bounced the Bills' way as they scored 35 
points in a 24-minute span. Beebe's long reception was tipped; Reed dropped the 
ball, but picked it up before completing a pass to Bill Brooks for a 32-yard 
gain; Mike Dumas caught teammate Yonel Jourdain's fumble on a kickoff return 
and turned it into a 62-yard play to set up another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That ball was bouncing very strangely tonight," Miami guard Keith Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a couple of good bounces that helped them, but we have to be able to 
overcome those sorts of things," Shula said. "We came apart in that third 
quarter. It's really tough to deal with and live with." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly completed 18 of 28 passes for 299 yards with one interception. Miami's 
Dan Marino completed 25 of 42 for 311 yards and three touchdowns but had three 
passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo closed to 17-14 on the second play of the second half. Kelly's long 
pass deflected off safety Gene Atkins' hand, allowing Beebe to grab the ball in 
full stride and continue down the sideline for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some lucky plays," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said. "But you've got to do 
something with it after you get the lucky plays." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills quickly got the ball back on Matt Darby's interception, and they 
took a 21-17 lead nine plays later when Kelly connected with Reed for the first 
time, with Reed beating J.B. Brown on third down for a 21-yard touchdown 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Miami punt, Reed's pass to Brooks set up Carwell Gardner's one-yard 
touchdown run for a 28-17 Buffalo lead. The drive was sustained by a third-down 
pass interference penalty against Troy Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins closed to 28-23 when Marino passed to Keith Jackson on a 23-yard 
touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jourdain and Dumas teamed on the bizarre kickoff return to set up another 
one-yard touchdown run by Gardner, and Reed beat a blitz for an 83-yard 
touchdown pass play to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was," Levy said, "a huge win for us."

WIN OVER JETS LIFTS PATRIOTS' PLAYOFF HOPES; AFC: PUNT ON FAKE FIELD- GOAL 
ATTEMPT PLAYS KEY ROLE IN 24-13 VICTORY.

 Ricky Reynolds carried the ball -- and New England's playoff hopes -- into the 
end zone on an 11-yard interception return. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots defeated the New York Jets, 24-13, Sunday after Reynolds gave 
them a 17-13 lead with 3:51 left in the third quarter. Afterward, New England 
Coach Bill Parcells ran off the field, his right index finger raised toward the 
adoring crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unlikely sight for a team that was sinking with a four-game losing 
streak just a month ago. Now the Patriots have won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't pay attention to a lot of people," Parcells said of doomsayers who 
emerged during the slide. "We have a pretty good edge right now in terms of a 
mental edge and I'd like to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots (7-6) moved ahead of their AFC East rival Jets (6-7). There was 
little jubilation as the Jets trudged to their locker room after their third 
loss in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we'll find out how much character we have," Jet quarterback Boomer 
Esiason said. "It'll be very tough. We'll have to listen to doubters and we'll 
have to get them back on the wagon. We'll have to stay tight as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots aren't worried about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a young team with a lot of hungry guys," New England running back 
Marion Butts said. "You have to have three factors in order to make it to the 
playoffs and win and we have all three, motivation, desire and courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Art Monk tied Steve Largent's NFL record of 177 consecutive games with at 
least one catch on a seven-yard reception with 3:25 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been much more satisfying if we had won," Monk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The game turned on a fake field-goal try that became a punt and pinned the 
Jets at their one-yard line. After Richie Anderson ran twice for four yards, 
Esiason threw toward Ryan Yarborough on the left side. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds cut in front, caught the ball and cruised the rest of the way for the 
Patriots' first defensive touchdown of the year and New York's first turnover 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fake field-goal attempt, the Patriots had a fourth and seven at the 
New York 31. Punter Pat O'Neill, who also tries long field goals, lined up for 
a field goal. Instead, he placed a punt perfectly, and tackle Todd Rucci downed 
the ball at the one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fake field goal was the big play of the game," Jet Coach Pete Carroll 
said. "We couldn't get the ball out of there."

DALUISO KICKS GIANTS PAST BROWNS, 16-13; INTERCONFERENCE: HIS 33-YARD FIELD 
GOAL WITH 19 SECONDS LEFT PROVIDES THE DIFFERENCE AND KNOCKS CLEVELAND FROM TOP 
OF AFC CENTRAL FOR FIRST TIME.

<P>
 Suddenly the playoffs aren't such a sure thing for the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Daluiso's 33-yard field goal with 19 seconds left Sunday gave the New 
York Giants a 16-13 victory and knocked the Browns out of first place in the 
AFC Central for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 With difficult road games at Dallas and division-leading Pittsburgh coming up, 
the Browns (9-4) have some reason to worry. They haven't been to the playoffs 
since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be hard to put this loss completely behind us," said Vinny 
Testaverde, who threw two interceptions and lost a fumble for three of 
Cleveland's five turnovers. "We need to realize the opportunities that lie 
ahead. This loss has to be used as motivation to get us through the next two 
tough games on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants (6-7) led for most of the game, but Leroy Hoard's five-yard run 
with 4:24 left pulled the Browns into a 13-13 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Brown and the Giants, with the worst offense in the NFL, then went to 
work. Starting at his 26, Brown connected with Chris Calloway for 26 yards on 
third and 15, Mike Sherrard for 13 yards on third and nine and ran six yards on 
third and one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was taking the mentality that I wasn't going to screw this up," Brown said. 
"I played a little too cautious at times. . . . But once the two-minute drill 
came around, I realized there was nothing to lose by going out there and being 
more aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Daluiso hooked the winning kick inside the left upright as a light rain fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Daluiso, normally the Giants' kickoff specialist, made three field goals in 
the game after David Treadwell was benched for missing a 37-yard field goal 
late in the first half. Treadwell also missed two attempts last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants kept their faint playoff hopes alive with their third consecutive 
victory after a seven-game losing streak. All three victories were by three 
points of less. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland began the day with a chance to clinch a playoff berth. The Browns 
self-destructed, committing turnovers on four of their first five second-half 
possessions before finally tying it on Hoard's run. Rookie Derrick Alexander 
set up the touchdown with a 60-yard reception from Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown completed 17 of 33 passes for 226 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown 
pass to Aaron Pierce in the first quarter.

STEELERS SHOW THEY BELONG IN PLAYOFFS; AFC: MORRIS SCORES TWO TOUCHDOWNS, 
DEFENSE RECORDS FIVE SACKS IN 38-15 VICTORY OVER BENGALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers became a playoff team Sunday by finally playing like 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Bam Morris ran over the Cincinnati Bengals all afternoon and the pass rush 
brought Jeff Blake down to earth again and again in a 38-15 victory that was 
the Steelers' most emphatic of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh (10-3) didn't celebrate very much after clinching at least a 
wild-card berth -- there's still a little matter of the AFC Central title and 
home-field advantage to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers took a one-game lead over Cleveland when the Browns lost to the 
New York Giants, 16-13. In two weeks, the Browns and Steelers play in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers left rainy Riverfront Stadium knowing if they keep playing like 
this, they could be playing well into January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe in our talent. Right now, we're playing really well," said Rod 
Woodson, who returned one of the Steelers' two interceptions for a touchdown. 
"This team is so different. You can't even compare it to our teams the last few 
years that lost in the first round." 
</P>
<P>
 This Pittsburgh team is setting itself apart from the ones that lost 
first-round playoff games the last two years. It's been very consistent down 
the stretch, winning five in a row for the first time since 1983. And its 
defense is simply scary. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Blake, who came into the game as the AFC's top-ranked passer but had 
trouble with the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, sacked only eight times in the first five games, went down five times 
Sunday, all in the second half. He completed only eight of 19 for a season-low 
156 yards as the Bengals (2-11) were held to less than 200 total yards for only 
the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They opened up their offense and we opened up our defense," linebacker Greg 
Lloyd said. "This guy (Blake), he was like everybody else out there. They don't 
know where we're coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, there and everywhere. They forced two interceptions and Lloyd stripped 
Blake on a sack. 
</P>
<P>
 "They rushed outside, but they rushed inside too," Blake said. "I wasn't able 
to step up in the pocket like I usually do." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not all. The defense provided the pivotal moment with a goal-line stand 
from the two-yard line late in the first half. Derrick Fenner ran three times 
for 1 1/2 yards and Blake was forced into a hurried incompletion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't get it done, for whatever reason," Fenner said. "I don't know 
what to say. They played good defense -- how about that?"

WITH PEETE, COWBOYS DON'T MISS BEAT; NFC:AIKMAN STILL OUT, BUT SMITH AND IRVIN 
HELP FILL VOID IN VICTORY OVER EAGLES THAT CLINCHES EAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even without Troy Aikman, the Dallas Cowboys had more than enough firepower to 
clinch their third consecutive NFC East title. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with Emmitt Smith, who carried 25 times for 91 yards and two touchdowns 
to lead the Cowboys over the Philadelphia Eagles, 31-19, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss in Michael Irvin, who had four receptions for 117 yards and a touchdown, 
and it's not difficult to understand why the Cowboys (11-2) were able to hand 
the Eagles their fourth consecutive loss. It was Dallas' 14th successive NFC 
East victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us expect to win it. When you expect things and it happens, it is no 
big deal," said safety Darren Woodson, who made the biggest play for the 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned the momentum dramatically in Dallas' favor with a 94-yard 
interception return for a touchdown after Philadelphia got within 24-19 in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he (Cunningham) saw me coming out to the flat," Woodson said. 
"I jumped on the route." 
</P>
<P>
 A 49-yard punt return by Jeff Sydner gave the Eagles the ball on the Cowboys' 
12 before Woodson stepped in front of Randall Cunningham's pass intended for 
James Joseph. He sidestepped a diving Cunningham at the Dallas 30 and ran down 
the left sideline untouched for the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodson said the Dallas defense sensed that Sydner's punt return put 
Philadelphia back in the game and wanted to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the game was starting to turn and we need- ed to make a big play," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Peete, replacing the injured Aikman (sprained knee), completed 10 of 17 
passes for 172 yards and a touchdown in his first start for the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I didn't want to do was go out and do everything myself, because 
there's too many great players on this team," the former USC quarterback said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys scored 42 points in their last game with third-stringer Jason 
Garrett at quarterback. Smith said Peete's performance adds that much more 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be able to show that we can win with three quarterbacks," Smith 
said. "It's a great feeling knowing you can count on every quarterback you have 
on the roster." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham, who finished 29 of 46 for 327 yards, took the blame for Woodson's 
clinching touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just terrible," he said of the pass. "Put it on me. I threw the 
interception, don't blame my teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the losing streak, Cunningham said he saw signs the Eagles (7-6) 
aren't completely lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if we had flat out got beaten badly, it would have hurt," he said. 
"We know what we're capable of doing now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham completed 10 consecutive passes during the third and fourth 
quarters. The 10th went five yards to Maurice Johnson to cut the Dallas lead to 
24-19. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas increased its 14-6 halftime lead early in the third quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith had a 17-yard run and a 23-yard catch before going in untouched on a 
three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 21-6, the Eagles put together their first touchdown drive midway 
through the third quarter. Cunningham capped it with a 25-yard pass to Fred 
Barnett, who finished with seven catches for 99 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A 37-yard pass to Irvin set up the Cowboys' fourth score, a 19-yard field goal 
by Chris Boniol on the first play of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys took the lead late in the first quarter following a 49-yard drive 
that ended with Irvin crossing underneath the zone, taking a pass from Peete 
and sprinting into the end zone for the 19-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia responded with an interception by linebacker William Thomas, who 
grabbed a pass tipped by Andy Harmon and returned it to the Dallas 33.

LATE TOUCHDOWN GIVES BUCCANEERS A VICTORY; NFC: ERICKSON SNEAKS IN FOR WINNING 
SCORE WITH 32 SECONDS LEFT IN 26-21 VICTORY OVER REDSKINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A two-game winning streak isn't unusual unless you're the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Erickson's quarterback sneak with 32 seconds remaining Sunday gave the 
Buccaneers a 26-21 victory over the Washington Redskins and consecutive 
victories for the first time since September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The streak comes on the heels of a six-game slide that assured Tampa Bay of a 
12th consecutive losing record and revived speculation about Jimmy Johnson 
replacing Sam Wyche as coach next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning is the magic elixir. It heals all wounds. It's the seven-day wonder," 
said Wyche, 14-31 in three seasons with the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he took a jab at some of his critics among the crowd of 45,121. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a group of fans right behind our bench who can't wait for Jimmy 
Johnson to arrive," said Wyche, whose record as well as the Buccaneers 
impending sale make it doubtful he'll return in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't make a yard, they get into the chant. They were the ones who were 
mocking and making life unfun for me, especially of late. 
</P>
<P>
 "But beyond that little cowardly crew, it's been a tremendous crowd and 
they've stuck with us. We can't be happier for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson's winning touchdown capped an 11-play, 80-yard drive that featured 
the running of Errict Rhett, who gained a Tampa Bay rookie-record 192 yards in 
40 carries, and pass plays of 19 yards to Courtney Hawkins and 13 yards to 
Lawrence Dawsey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins, who used Andre Collins' 92-yard interception return and long 
scoring passes from Heath Shuler to Desmond Howard and Olanda Truitt to take a 
21-17 lead, squandered an opportunity to stop the march when a potential 
game-saving interception bounced off Darryl Morrison's chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay, which defeated Minnesota, 20-17, in overtime last week, improved to 
4-9. Washington (2-11) has lost five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson was 18 of 35 for 251 yards and one touchdown. Rhett, who has gained 
774 yards, broke Tampa Bay's single-game rookie rushing record as well as the 
season rookie record of 690 by Jerry Eckwood in 1990.

SANDERS RUSHES FOR 188 YARDS TO LEAD LIONS TO 34-31 VICTORY; NFC: RUNNING BACK 
SETS PERSONAL RECORD FOR YARDS IN A SEASON AS DETROIT DEFEATS GREEN BAY TO KEEP 
PLAYOFF HOPES ALIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Watching Barry Sanders run was almost like a religious experience for Detroit 
Coach Wayne Fontes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders rushed 20 times for 188 yards and one touchdown Sunday and the Lions 
held on for a 34-31 victory over the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing Fontes was almost speechless after the record-setting day by 
Sanders kept the Lions' hopes alive for an NFC wild-card berth and probably 
sank Green Bay's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will think I'm getting religion. But Barry Sanders is one of a kind," 
Fontes said. "I've seen them all. I watch miles and miles of film. I see 
hundreds each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when they made him, that's the prototype you want. Guys, he's the best 
I've ever seen. And he's a whale of an individual. He's just one guy you want 
on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 A 63-yard run by Sanders set up a go-ahead one-yard touchdown dive by Derrick 
Moore with 9:02 left. Sanders broke his single-season record of 1,548 yards, 
set in 1991, during the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders now leads the NFL with 1,594 rushing yards. That leaves him 406 shy of 
becoming the third player in history to rush for 2,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great one," Green Bay Coach Mike Holmgren said. "He's an awesome 
player, especially on the artificial turf field. No, he's a great player 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers drove to the Lions' 17 late in the fourth quarter, but Willie Clay 
came up with Detroit's second interception. The Packers got the ball back with 
1:51 remaining, but the Lions' defense never let them beyond their own 46-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was a payback for a 38-30 Green Bay victory three weeks ago when 
the Packers held Sanders to 47 yards in Milwaukee. The Lions (7-6) moved ahead 
of the Packers (6-7) in the NFC Central with Sunday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Favre completed 29 of 43 passes for 366 yards and three touchdowns for 
Green Bay, but had two costly interceptions. They were rare mistakes for Favre, 
who had thrown for 13 touchdowns with only two interceptions in the five games 
before this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's Dave Krieg was 18 of 30 for 196 yards and two touchdowns with no 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was 24-24 in the third quarter when Anthony Morgan, who had six 
catches for 103 yards, got behind cornerback Greg Jeffries for the second time 
in broken coverage and caught a 47-yard touchdown pass from Favre for a 31-24 
Green Bay lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hanson, who had a 27-yard field goal in the first quarter, pulled 
Detroit within 31-27 with a 34-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 There were three lead changes in the final 8:22 of the second quarter, when 
Detroit outscored the Packers, 21-7, for a 24-21 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers took a 14-3 lead on a 27-yard pass from Favre to Morgan and a 
96-yard kickoff return by Robert Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's rally started when Robert Massey picked off a Favre pass for 
Sterling Sharpe and returned it 17 yards to the Green Bay 29. Two plays later, 
Krieg lofted a 24-yard touchdown pass to Herman Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 On Detroit's next possession, Sanders carried three times for 68 yards, 
including a nifty 13-yard scamper around left end to give the Lions their first 
lead, 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Favre and Sharpe, who caught 10 passes for 115 yards, hooked up for a 22-yard 
touchdown pass play that put Green Bay ahead, 21-17. But the Lions, aided by a 
23-yard pass interference call against Dave Evans, scored on a one-yard toss 
from Krieg to Scott Conover, an offensive tackle who lined up at right end on 
the play.

YOUNG LEADS 49ERS TO A ROUT OF FALCONS; NFC WEST: QUARTERBACK ACCOUNTS FOR FIVE 
SCORES, DEFENSE FORCES FIVE TURNOVERS IN 50-14 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Steve Young threw for three touchdowns and ran for two more and the San 
Francisco defense forced five turnovers as the 49ers won for the eighth 
consecutive time Sunday, a 50-14 rout of the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our thing is to just keep that offense clicking, and that's what we were able 
to do," San Francisco tackle Steve Wallace said. "We just wanted to get first 
downs, keep the chains moving. Somehow, we ended up with 50 points, but I don't 
have a clue how we did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta mistakes had something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnovers led to 17 points and Deion Sanders limited Andre Rison to one 
catch, which came in the final minute of the third quarter. There were none of 
the fights that marked the first meeting between the former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just put it to us," said Atlanta quarterback Jeff George, who threw two 
interceptions and fumbled once. "They kicked our butts all day. They're the 
better team." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison, who had a second catch in the fourth quarter while Sanders was on the 
sideline with other San Francisco starters, said the two made their peace in a 
talk before the game and then enjoyed a friendly competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just like we were roommates," Rison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sanders: "He's their best receiver, I don't care who's covering him." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Sanders and Rison drew the pregame attention, it was a day for Young 
and the offense. His third touchdown pass, a nine-yarder to Jerry Rice with 
12:14 remaining, gave him 20 during San Francisco's streak. Seven of them have 
come in the two victories over the Falcons (6-7), whose wild-card hopes took a 
severe hit. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco (11-2) outscored Atlanta, 92-17, in sweeping the season series 
and maintaining its tiebreaker edge over Dallas in a race for home-field 
advantage throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The satisfying part about the (victory) is Atlanta upgraded its team and 
posed the biggest threat to us this year," Young said. "Now we want to keep the 
heat on . . . We've got to keep matching the top record in the league. I think 
we all understand we have to win the rest of our games." 
</P>
<P>
 Young did his part by completing 22 of 33 passes for 294 yards, shaking off an 
interception return for a touchdown by defensive end Chuck Smith that ended a 
string of 123 passes without being picked off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he's played well for the past few years, but this year he's in a 
zone, like when Michael Jordan gets hot," San Francisco tight end Brent Jones 
said of Young, bidding for a fourth consecutive passing title. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always been very accurate, but now he's just putting the ball right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 George completed 15 of 29 for 193 yards and a touchdown, but was intercepted 
twice by Merton Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
 George also fumbled after being sacked by Todd Kelly, and Charles Mann 
recovered, setting up Young's scoring pass to Rice. George bruised his ribs on 
the play and Bobby Hebert finished up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did what we said we couldn't do -- gave up turnovers," Atlanta Coach June 
Jones said. "We want to match them score for score, but we couldn't do that. 
They're playing awfully well, maybe the best I've ever seen."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; BEST PAL HITS STRIDE WITH LATEST VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone needed a confidence builder: Trainer Richard Mandella, jockey Chris 
McCarron, owners John and Betty Mabee, their racing manager Gayle Van Leer and, 
most of all, Best Pal. The not-so-creaky gelding, less than a month from his 
seventh birthday, delivered in his best style, circling the field at the top of 
the stretch for a four-length victory in Sunday's $109,000 Native Diver 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first time Best Pal had won a race under McCarron; it was Best 
Pal's first victory in a graded race in 16 months; and it was only the fourth 
in the last 16 starts for the Mabees' horse. The timing was right. Best Pal 
rarely loses at Hollywood Park -- Sunday's victory was his sixth in seven 
starts on dirt there -- and McCarron only fails to win the Native Diver when he 
doesn't have a mount in the race. Best Pal gave the Hall of Fame jockey his 
fifth consecutive victory in the stake, not counting last year when no trainer 
was smart enough to hire him for the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that Best Pal didn't respond at Churchill Downs, it was just that 
he didn't have his best stride," said McCarron, recalling Best Pal's 
fifth-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Classic last month. "He just wasn't 
handling the track. But after what he showed today, I'd say that he hasn't lost 
any steps whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal was at least six wide, in the center of the track, entering the 
stretch, but the way he cruised up to the leaders, out of last place and eight 
lengths behind with five-eighths of a mile to go, Mandella wasn't worried. Best 
Pal overhauled Tossofthecoin in mid-stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needed this win," Mandella said, "to let himself know that he's the big 
fish again. You can't keep running a horse this good and keep getting his 
brains beat out. But when this horse runs his race, I'm not afraid of anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Tossofthecoin, who has earned more than $400,000 without winning a stake, 
finished second for the 10th time, with Royal Chariot third, 3 1/2 more lengths 
behind. Sea Cadet, the other 6-year-old in the seven-horse field and second 
choice in the betting, was fourth, beaten by 10 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored Best Pal, carrying high weight of 121 pounds, paid $5 to win and ran 1 
1/8 miles in 1:48 2/5, a second slower than the stakes record. The richest 
horse in training, he earned $64,000 to surpass the $5.1-million mark, but he's 
still a distant third behind Alysheba and John Henry on the overall list. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal finished the year with two victories, two seconds and one third in 
seven starts. The first major goal for 1995 is the Santa Anita Handicap, a race 
that Best Pal won in 1992. Mandella figures on one prep race for the March 11 
Big 'Cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal's last 1994 race was supposed to be the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup 
next Sunday, but when the Mabees and one of their other trainers, David 
Hofmans, elected not to run Dramatic Gold in the Native Diver, Best Pal's 
assignment came a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some question about him getting the mile and a half next week," 
Mandella said Sunday. "But the way he looked today, I don't think that would 
have been much of a problem. I'm still not sure we did the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Valenzuela was the first jockey to win with Best Pal, in the horse's first 
race, at Hollywood Park in May 1990. The horse's 16 victories (in 38 starts) 
have been distributed among Valenzuela, Jose Santos, Kent Desormeaux, Corey 
Black and now McCarron, who had ridden Best Pal three times before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron's best previous finish astride Best Pal was a second behind Tinners 
Way in the $1-million Pacific Classic at Del Mar in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a different feeling there is riding this horse at Del Mar and Hollywood 
as opposed to back East," McCarron said. "It's the difference in the tracks. He 
just spins his wheels in that sand back there and doesn't get a good hold of 
it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux, the meet's leading jockey, was sidelined most of last week 
because of the flu and didn't ride Sunday.

 Three-time Olympic gold medalist Alberto Tomba of Italy began what he says 
will be his last season of competitive skiing with a World Cup slalom victory 
Sunday in Tignes, France.  
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, who won two golds in the 1988 Olympic Games and another in the 1992 
Games, was timed in 1 minute, 41.84 seconds for the two runs. He beat Michael 
Tritscher of Austria by 1.2 seconds. Third was Thomas Fogdoe of Sweden in 
1:43.03. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 34th World Cup victory for Tomba, 27, and his 23rd in the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba is fourth in overall World Cup career victories. He can catch Pirmin 
Zurbriggen (40) and Marc Girardelli (43) if he has an exceptional year. 
</P>
<P>
 The career leader is Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden, who won 86 races.

 Swiss veteran Heidi Zeller-Baehler rallied from third place after the first 
run to win a women's World Cup giant slalom in Vail, Colo., in a combined time 
of 2:14.86.

 Zeller-Baehler, 27, who earned her first World Cup victory in a giant slalom 
last week at Park City, Utah, solidified her hold on first place in this 
season's overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Vreni Schneider had a ragged start on her second run and had to 
settle for second place at 2:15.08. Marianne Kjoerstad of Norway was third in 
2:15.44.

Sunday in 7:19.27. Carla Zijlstra of the Netherlands was second, clocking 
7:26.69.

<P>
 Markus Prock of Austria kept his record perfect for the season, winning his 
third consecutive World Cup luge race in Winterberg, Germany, by beating 
Italy's Armin Zoeggeler and Duncan Kennedy of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Prock, the Olympic silver medalist, was timed in 1:44.682. Zoeggeler's time 
was 1:44.771, and Kennedy came in at 1:44.806.

 Think of an old-fashioned theater organ and you think of the once-grand 
downtown movie palaces of a half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's modest Plummer Auditorium probably doesn't come to mind.But this 
auditorium -- owned by the Fullerton Joint Union High School District -- is 
home to a mighty Wurlitzer organ. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in the 1930s, the instrument is probably the largest theater organ on 
public display in Southern California, said Bob Trousdale, owner of the 
Trousdale Organ Company. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70-year-old Santa Ana resident renovated the organ's electronic system in 
1993, and is now leading a volunteer effort to further enhance this "king of 
instruments," as theater organs are affectionately called.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; STRONG ARGUMENT FOR CARGO FLIGHT TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of Orange County's effort to remain competitive, a strong argument is 
being advanced for allowing a few all-cargo jetliner flights at John Wayne 
Airport. Last week the county Airport Commission approved a plan that would 
allow United Parcel Service and Federal Express to begin some flights in a 
two-year test. The County Board of Supervisors should do likewise when it 
considers the proposal on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's unanimous approval was an indication of the successful job 
that proponents have done in addressing any concerns that such flights would be 
loud, occur late at night, add to air traffic congestion or otherwise adversely 
affect the environment. The City of Newport Beach even released a statement 
consenting to the amendments before last week's hearing, contingent on 
confirmation from the Federal Aviation Administration that the agreement does 
not violate federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of air traffic over Newport Beach is always delicate, as shown by 
the 1985 court agreement aimed at reducing noise at John Wayne and by the 
enthusiasm Newport Beach has had for getting a commercial airport at the El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station. But the issue of cargo flights is an important 
one for businesses in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Since all the flights out of John Wayne now are passenger, it is only fair to 
allow some cargo flights. In the past, county supervisors have given passenger 
service top priority in assigning the scarce operational slots at the airport. 
But this has put the county, which generates 30% of the region's total air 
cargo load, at a disadvantage in the face of projections that the area's cargo 
load will increase substantially by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 As it now stands, United Parcel Service and Federal Express are forced to 
truck the packages of customers out before they can be flown to other parts of 
the country. This is much more than an inconvenience for the carriers. It 
forces local businesses to meet earlier deadlines for getting packages out, and 
in some cases can mean that needed medical equipment cannot be transported 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the lack of cargo service affects not only businesses and their 
customers but the entire community by adding to the county's street and freeway 
congestion and air pollution. The arguments over the future of the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station have turned in part on the lack of air cargo traffic 
capacity. But with the future of El Toro very much undecided, it makes sense to 
take action now to help Orange County stay competitive.

RAM LOSS TO SAINTS, EVERETT NO EASIER THE SECOND TIME; PRO FOOTBALL: L.A. SITS 
IN LAST PLACE IN NFC WEST AFTER 31-15 LOSS TO NEW ORLEANS AND FORMER 
QUARTERBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although John Shaw, team president, said no announcement about a possible move 
to St. Louis is imminent, the Rams have packed it in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams not only fell flat in losing to the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, 
31-15, but suffered the embarrassment of being beaten again by Jim Everett, 
their former quarterback, who was traded for a seventh-round pick in the 1995 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn right it's (humiliating)," said Ram cornerback Darryl Henley. "The guy 
kicked our butt. Twice!" 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, 2-0 against the Rams and 3-8 vs. the rest of the NFL, returned to 
boos and poor field position in his first trip back to Anaheim Stadium. 
However, after taking possession at his own one-yard line, Everett drove the 
Saints the distance, capped off by the first of three touchdown runs by Mario 
Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't ready to play," said Ram linebacker Roman Phifer. "We had them on 
the one-yard line to start the game and let them go the whole way. We didn't 
play with any intensity; we let them set the tone." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett went on to help the Saints to a 28-7 halftime lead before leaving 
because of an ankle injury in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was down there where the melon heads are and they always make a lot of 
noise," said Everett, who completed 13 of 22 passes for 161 yards, including a 
30-yard touchdown pass to Michael Haynes. "A lot of credit to the melon heads. 
Heck, maybe they'll wear them in Baltimore or St. Louis, or wherever the heck 
they are." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (4-9), assured of their fifth consecutive losing season, suffered 
their eighth consecutive loss to the Saints before 34,960, the fourth-smallest 
crowd at Anaheim Stadium since the Rams' arrival in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we can keep the streak going in St. Louis," said Saint Coach Jim Mora. 
</P>
<P>
 That's cold, as cold as the numbers documenting the Rams' plight: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 15-30 record, including a 7-18 mark in the last 25 games, under Coach 
Chuck Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An 0-6 record this season against NFC West opponents, 2-16 during Knox's 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 2-7 record for quarterback Chris Miller, who was hired to replace 
Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who completed 17 of 24 passes for 198 yards, passed for touchdowns of 
24 yards to Todd Kinchen and five yards to Jerome Bettis, but for the second 
time this season against New Orleans, he was forced from the game because of a 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' plan, which included a proposed four-game sweep over the Saints, 
Tampa Bay, Chicago and Washington to finish 8-8, was sabotaged by four 
turnovers, including two fumbled punts by Kinchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're a good enough team to overcome the adversity that we have 
been having," Bettis said. "I think we're a good enough team to win, but when 
you lay the ball on the ground four times . . . it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints scored 24 points off Ram turnovers, and were also aided by 10 Ram 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take responsibility for it because I'm the coach," said Knox, who called 
the loss the Rams' most disappointing this season. "We had four turnovers and 
some penalties and other things out there that shouldn't happen. But, that's 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen's fumbled punt in the closing seconds of the first quarter gave the 
Saints the ball at the Rams' 44-yard line, and after a 33-yard pass from 
Everett to Haynes, Bates opened the second quarter with an 11-yard touchdown 
run through the middle of the Ram defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints, last in the league in rushing, gained 137 yards on the ground, 96 
by Bates. Bates scored his third touchdown -- matching his season total -- 
later in the second quarter after a David Lang fumble at the Rams' 15-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Same old song," Ram safety Anthony Newman said. "Everett had nothing to do 
with it. No one cares about Jim Everett. We care about ourselves and winning 
football games. Win or lose, Jim has nothing more to do with this team. We just 
didn't do anything right today; that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams tried to mount a comeback in the final two minutes of the half, but 
after getting to the Saints' 40-yard line, New Orleans' linebacker Darion 
Conner forced Miller to fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints took over at their 49 and needed only four plays and 44 seconds to 
score again, with Haynes beating Henley and catching a 30-yard touchdown pass 
from Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know what to say anymore," said Ram cornerback Todd Lyght. "I've 
been here four years and it's the same thing: It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints backed off on defense in the second half and allowed Miller and his 
relief, Chris Chandler, to pass short and, as a result, run time off the clock. 
Running back Johnny Bailey, who finished with 11 catches for 116 yards, became 
the Ram offense and set up Miller's touchdown pass to Bettis with 11:29 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis ran for the two-point conversion, and after the Saints took almost 
seven minutes off the clock before punting, the Rams went on the offensive once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Wayne Martin breezed past rookie Ram tackle Wayne Gandy and 
sacked Miller, knocking him from the game with a concussion. Chandler, who was 
coming back from an ankle injury, got the Rams to the New Orleans one-yard line 
with 1:39 remaining. But on second and goal, Bettis was dropped for a one-yard 
loss, throwing the Rams into chaos and prompting Chandler to spike the ball to 
stop the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of timeouts and now stuck on fourth down with two yards to go, Chandler 
called his own number on the quarterback draw, but fell inches short of 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as it might have looked like it, I don't think we quit," said Ram 
defensive end Fred Stokes. "It's like a war zone with bodies everywhere and a 
dead feeling. The people getting shot up might look like they've given up, but 
there are still guys out there fighting on the battlefield. They might not be 
getting much done, but they're still fighting."

SEAHAWKS' HEARTS ARE NOT IN GAME; PRO FOOTBALL: PLAYERS' THOUGHTS ARE FOCUSED 
ON THEIR PARALYZED TEAMMATE, MIKE FRIER, AND NOT ON INDIANAPOLIS, WHICH COMES 
BACK TO WIN, 31-19. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They took the field with the bravado of heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 They left it in despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with what they thought was a chance to heal tragic wounds, the Seattle 
Seahawks realized something early in their 31-19 loss to the Indianapolis Colts 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wounds might never heal. This tragedy will never be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen game balls will not make teammate Mike Frier walk again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime during the process of blowing a 10-point lead and committing five 
turnovers, 45 men intent on winning one for the Gipper learned a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the Gipper is a lie. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was supposed to be an inspirational game for a teammate paralyzed in 
an auto accident three days earlier, the Seahawks left their hearts in their 
lockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A game ball would have been nice, but you know something?" asked safety 
Eugene Robinson. "When all the cheering stops, when all the lights are off, you 
still have a guy lying on his back, in a bed, fighting to walk." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what we did out there, as soon as the game ended, nothing would 
change," he said. "We still have a teammate fighting for his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Frier, a reserve defensive tackle, was paralyzed from the neck down in a 
one-car accident Thursday night that also caused injuries to starting running 
back Chris Warren and back-up running back Lamar Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, who suffered two cracked ribs, surprised his teammates by showing up 
Sunday morning ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 He then surprised the 39,574 fans at the Kingdome with 81 yards on 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that has happened, I know it affected the team today," said somber 
Seahawk Coach Tom Flores. "I mean, it has to." 
</P>
<P>
 Frier, a seventh-round draft choice from Appalachian State, had spent a total 
of only about two months with the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 He was with them during their 1992 training camp before being claimed on 
waivers by the Cincinnati Bengals, then he rejoined them last month after being 
released by the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 His Seahawk career consisted of only two games. He had no sacks, tackles or 
even assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistically, he was never here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he was in this locker room with us, he was one of us," said Joe Nash, 
Seahawk nose tackle. "And that was enough." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Seahawks did all the right things. And came up with all the wrong 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 They wrote his number 92 on their wrists. But those wrists threw two 
interceptions and lost three fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 They wrote his number on their shoes. But those shoes gained only 238 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 They prayed for him before the game, a prayer led by Robinson in the seclusion 
of their locker room. The Kingdome crowd offered a moment of silence minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the Seahawks played the sloppiest, most insensitive game of their 
season with 13 penalties for 124 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It almost got to the point of being ridiculous," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment that a vehicle driven by Smith crashed into a utility pole on 
a rain-slicked residential road near the team's Kirkland headquarters at 8:40 
p.m. Thursday, this incident has been just as confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the car belonged to Smith, Kirkland police claimed Warren was 
driving. After reportedly spotting beer in the car, amid estimates that the car 
was being driven at an unsafe 50 m.p.h. in the rain, police arrested Warren on 
investigation of vehicular assault. They also tested his blood-alcohol level, 
with results to be announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, though, representatives for both Warren and Smith announced that 
Smith was the driver. This story has since been supported by Frier in a 
conversation with his girlfriend, according to Rick Schaeffer, Warren's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a seldom-used rookie third-round draft pick from Houston, is probably 
out for the season with a chip facture in his back. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a very, very disturbing three days for everybody," Schaeffer 
said. "Besides the obvious tragedy of Mike Frier, you have the police saying 
something that just isn't true, with the worry that it will take a long time 
for something like this to be undone." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren is so worried that in a statement he released to NBC television before 
Sunday's game, the first sentence proclaims that he wasn't the driver. The rest 
of the statement asks for prayers for Frier. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Warren refused to answer questions about Frier, and said he was not 
thinking about his friend during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 100 percent into it mentally," he said. "This is my job." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has become so unsettled that all three men have hired lawyers. 
The tension is so thick that lawyers have not even allowed Warren to speak to 
Frier since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Frier's family, meanwhile, has been accompanied by security guards while 
tending to Mike in the intensive care unit at Overlake Hospital Medical Center 
in Bellevue. 
</P>
<P>
 Frier, 25, contracted pneumonia Saturday, according to doctors, who said such 
an ailment is common among newly paralyzed patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-5, 300-pound man was sitting in the back seat when the car bounced 
off a median while trying to overtake another vehicle. It crossed the other 
lane, and crashed into a utility pole . 
</P>
<P>
 Frier broke his neck either on the roof or a large stereo speaker on the back 
dashboard. Doctors have said there is a 90 percent chance he will not walk 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is something that none of us can even imagine," Nash said. "That is the 
really hard part. One day the guy is running around here like everybody else. 
And the next. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easier for Seahawk defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy to imagine. Several 
years ago, he lost one of his best friends, Jerome Brown, when that former star 
defensive lineman was killed in an auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you wish you had done a lot more things with somebody, gotten close 
to him," Kennedy said. "(Mike) was always spending time with his daughter, and 
I was spending time with my family. Now I wish I had just a little of that time 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy and teammates had hoped to compensate for those lost moments by 
impressing Frier on Sunday. They will try again next week. But they can't 
promise it will be any better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're just living through today," Flores said.

MORNING BRIEFING: NOTION OF ILL WILL IN RIVALRY ON MARK, BUT NEVER ON THE BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writes on the bitter 
Steeler-Raider rivalry, including claims by the Steelers that the Raiders once 
gave them a deflated football to kick in Oakland and wrote obscenities on the 
game ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Stabler, former Raider quarterback, admitted to Bouchette that dirty words 
were written on the balls, but it wasn't the way the Steelers thought.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Romanski, our equipment guy, used to write profanities on our balls to 
keep us from stealing them," Stabler said. "You wouldn't take a ball like that 
home to your kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Raiders: Frenchy Fuqua, former Steeler, on the Raiders: "I still pull for 
the other team when they play someone. I just recently accepted them into the 
human race." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: How old was Terry Donahue when he became UCLA's football coach in 
1976? 
</P>
<P>
 Reprieve: Phil Jackman in the Baltimore Sun: "No need for blow-by-blow 
announcers to get in a dither about how to pronounce Profit Sithbangprachan's 
name. The International Boxing Federation flyweight champ just gave up his 
title rather than fight Jose Luis Zepeda." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Gretzky? Luc Robitaille still holds Wayne Gretzky partly responsible for 
the trade that sent him from the Kings to the Pittsburgh Penguins during the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine a rookie who forgets to make a pass to the veteran and gets put in

SOCCER / JULIE CART; BALBOA LIKELY TO JOIN LEADING CLUB IN GREECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 U.S. sweeper Marcelo Balboa is expected to join Olympiakos of the Greek First 
Division this week, Luis Balboa, Marcelo's father and agent, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Balboa said the two sides have agreed on a contract, but the club still 
must drop one of its foreign players to make room for Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa currently is training with the U.S. team in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa's strong performance during the World Cup was no surprise, but his lack 
of a professional contract had been. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been two stumbling blocks: doubt about the condition of his 
reconstructed knee and problems in contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Balboa said a deal was struck with Puebla, in the Mexican First Division, 
but fell through last month when the club faxed one offer to Balboa in Los 
Angeles and -- after he and his father had flown to Mexico and Balboa had been 
introduced to fans and media -- reneged on it and reduced the money for the 
option year. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, Balboa played for Olympiakos in a games against Red Star in 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Balboa said his son also has had offers from teams in England and France. 
</P>

 On Nov. 11, Tab Ramos played in his first game since being knocked unconscious 
during the U.S. team's second-round World Cup match against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 The road back for Ramos has been frustrating and dangerous -- doctors told the 
veteran midfielder that his fractured skull would keep him off the field for as 
long as nine months. They didn't know how long the blurred vision and headaches 
would continue. 
</P>
<P>
 So, even though he played for only the last 10 minutes when his Spanish First 
Division club Real Betis played Atletico Madrid, Ramos was grateful to be 
playing at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long way back," Ramos said from his home in Seville. "It's been 
pretty difficult. The injury was delicate -- I have to be careful to protect my 
head all the time. Even at home, if I'm bending over to pick something up, I'm 
thinking I could hit my head on something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to the point over the summer that I thought if I can go back to playing 
normally, I will. But if I don't, I won't. It's not worth it. You can't take 
that kind of a chance with your head." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos began training the first week in September and began to practice with 
his team the second week in October. 
</P>
<P>
 In his absence, Real Betis brought in another "foreign" midfielder, making it 
difficult for Ramos to win his starting job back. Spanish teams may use only 
three foreigners per match. Even when Ramos is completely recovered, he'll have 
to fight to be among the allotted three players. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos already had let his club know he wanted a transfer, but his injury 
complicated matters. By the time he returned to Spain in late August he all but 
missed the signing period that ended Sept. 1. The next signing period is Dec. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos has turned down an offer from a team in Portugal, preferring to stay in 
Spain. But the key thing is to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play," Ramos said. "I don't want to be the fifth foreigner. If you 
are a foreign player and you don't start, you don't even sit on the bench. You 
sit in the stands. I want to go somewhere where I can play."

 Arguments are still raging about the recently announced World Cup bonuses, 
specifically Alan Rothenberg's total of $7 million. Kitchen-table discussions 
and bar-stool battles are one thing, but a Congressional debate is quite 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Post reported that members of a House subcommittee responsible 
for Defense Department appropriations have begun looking into the possibility 
of placing a lien on the World Cup's $60-million profit as a way of recovering 
some of the $14 million in federal funds spent on World Cup security. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranking members of the House Armed Service Committee's subcommittee on 
readiness sent letters to Attorney General Janet Reno and Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry asking about the possibility of freezing the World Cup's 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters were sent after published reports of Rothenberg's $7 million and 
the $9 million in bonuses to other World Cup employees. According to the Post, 
the letters state: "We strongly feel that before any profit or bonuses are 
dispersed, the taxpayer deserves a refund, especially considering the acute 
funding problems that are cited by Defense Department officials." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter to Perry includes this: "What we would like to know now is, 
specifically, how DOD funds were expended and to what extend the Department 
expects to be reimbursed from the organizing committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg had projected a $20 million profit and explained the eventual $60 
million profit as the result, in part, of the unexpectedly low security costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the subcommittee were said to be upset about the size of 
Rothenberg's compensation: a salary of $800,000 over five years and a 
$3-million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Another note about Rothenberg's bonus: It is very possible that his salary 
made him the highest paid executive of a nonprofit company. 
</P>
<P>
 After the president of United Way of America quit in 1992 amid allegations 
that he misused funds of the nation's largest charity, the country was aghast 
to learn the chief executive earned $390,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted a survey by the Chronicle of Philanthropy of the nation's 100 
largest charitable foundations. According to the survey, only three of the 100 
nonprofit organizations paid their chief executives more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest salary went to the chairman of the Keck Foundation, who was paid 
$624,500 in 1991, the second year of Rothenberg's five-year $800,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Last point: Rothenberg said his bonus should be based on financial success of 
the World Cup, which made $60 million. The Keck Foundation had assets of $821 
million.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: WINTER TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 COME ON UP: During the summer, Orange County draws its international tourists 
mainly from Europe and Japan. But when winter approaches, the Australians 
visit. . . . Most vacation between November and mid-January, their spring and 
summer months when seven jumbo jets a day arrive in Southern California from 
Down Under. . . . Most attracted to Orange County come to see Disneyland, says 
an Australian consular official, but just how many he doesn't know. "As long as 
they don't get into trouble, we don't know about them." 
</P>
<P>
 COME ON DOWN: Migrating waterfowl descend on the county's coastal wetlands 
each year, and close behind them come hundreds of "eco-tourists." At Bolsa 
Chica, Huntington Beach and Upper Newport Bay, they ogle the likes of 
black-bellied plovers, Belding's Savannah sparrows, Western sandpipers and 
short-tailed clapper rails. . . . "This area is renowned for its bird 
watching," said Chris Obaditch, president of the Sea & Sage chapter of the 
Audubon Society. "And winter is the height of the bird-watching season." 
</P>
<P>
 YULE ARMADA: Peak tourist season for waterfront businesses in Newport Harbor 
is December, when the Christmas Boat Parade draws an estimated 1 million 
visitors, mainly from nearby counties. . . . The demand for charter boats to 
view the nightly parade, which will start Dec. 17, is so intense that it 
provides half of the charter business for the year, says Bob Black, above, 
owner of Catalina Passenger Service. . . . Black even cancels his daily runs to 
Santa Catalina Island, because "we need all our boats out on the harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 COLD CASH: You'd think winter would cool down those beachfront vacation rents, 
but it doesn't. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day in Balboa, for example, 
waterfront properties rent for $2,300 per week and up, equaling peak summer 
rates. . . . The reason is strong demand from "snowbirds," the well-to-do from 
the Midwest and East who fly here to escape the snow. . . . One Balboa rental 
agent says that even after the holidays, demand persists and rents decline only 
about $300 a week or so.

ROMAN CATHOLICS HONOR PATRON SAINT OF MEXICO; RELIGION: ABOUT 400 PEOPLE JOIN 
IN THE DOWNTOWN SANTA ANA PROCESSION AND CULTURAL CELEBRATION FOR OUR LADY OF 
GUADALUPE DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Before Isabel Lopez's mother died several years ago, she whispered reassurance 
to her daughter, "remember, you still have the Lady Guadalupe." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, 62, did remember Sunday as she and about 400 other Roman Catholics 
participated in the annual Our Lady of Guadalupe Day, a downtown procession 
honoring Mexico's patron saint. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Virgin was the mother of the Americas," Lopez said. "She represents peace 
and everything to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The event along 4th Street offered festivities and a parade of folkloric 
dancers and young children dressed in traditional garb, representing various 
Mexican regions and cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrants from dozens of Orange County churches linked arms and surrounded 
Bishop Norman F. McFarland of the Diocese of Orange, who led them along with 
performers re-enacting the tale of the four apparitions of the Virgin, which 
contributed to the spread of the Catholic faith in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 According to tradition, a poor Indian named Juan Diego heard sweet music from 
the Tepeyac hill, just northwest of Mexico City, on his way to the Franciscan 
church. The Mexican Virgin then appeared to him on that day -- Dec. 9, 1531 -- 
and instructed him to have the bishop build a church on Tepeyac in her honor, 
so that she could be the merciful mother to Diego and his people.  
</P>
<P>
 But the bishop did not believe Diego when he arrived at the church. The Virgin 
appeared to Diego on four occasions, finally commanding him to climb the 
Tepeyac hill and gather flowers flourishing in the winter and to take them to 
the bishop.  
</P>
<P>
 And so Diego complied, the tale continued. When he went again to the bishop, 
the flowers he had gathered in his mantel fell to the ground, revealing the 
image of a brown-skinned Virgin in the cloth. The Basilica of the Lady of 
Guadalupe, whose image is known for a praying woman standing on a crescent moon 
with her head tilted to the side, is now at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Catholics of Mexican descent, the procession marked the early part of 
the novena, a nine-day period marked by prayers, leading to the Dec. 12 
commemoration of the Feast Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the unexpected cold weather Sunday, the event was enlivened by various 
cultures that transcended generations and borders, said organizers.  
</P>
<P>
 Different Mexican states and people proudly presented their cultures through 
dress and dance. The ceremony began with the Matechines, indigenous men and 
women dancing in red vests and long skirts, studded with bells and beads. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-aged girls in wide-bottomed and ruffled dresses in shades of purple 
represented the Jalisco state. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is such a spirituality for Our Lady and the people here," said 
organizer Juanamaria Amezquita, of the Diocese of Orange.

6 INFLUENTIAL CITY LEADERS TO LEAVE POSTS; POLITICS: MEMBERS OF COUNCILS FORMED 
FISCAL, TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. GOODBYS COME THIS MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stan Oftelie, chief operating officer of the Orange County Transportation 
Authority, is losing the heart of his starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year of passing the torch in local politics, six of Orange County's most 
influential city council members, four of them members of OCTA's board of 
directors, are leaving office this month. They are the Tom Foleys and Dan 
Rostenkowskis of local politics in terms of power and prestige, with a total of 
90 years of public service. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than just wielding power, these six are recognized as consensus 
builders who came out of their neighborhoods to become regional leaders in 
forming difficult transportation, environmental and fiscal policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping down are Daniel H. Young of Santa Ana, Gary L. Hausdorfer of San Juan 
Capistrano, William D. Mahoney of La Habra, Robert F. Gentry of Laguna Beach, 
Evelyn R. Hart of Newport Beach and Henry W. Wedaa of Yorba Linda. They will 
not be easily replaced, Oftelie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people represent a generation of leadership in this county," said 
Oftelie, whose transportation board oversees an $625-million annual budget. "A 
thread among them is that they have all won reputations for their integrity. 
I'm sure every one of them has made somebody angry at one time or another 
somewhere in the county. But you know what they stand for. That's admirable, I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 Departure is always bittersweet. At least two of the six -- Young and 
Hausdorfer -- had bright futures in politics at one time, both as potential 
candidates for Congress. Hausdorfer also was a strongly considered candidate 
for the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Oftelie said he thinks they would have been fine representatives for the 
county. He does not tire of talking about the two good friends -- now business 
partners in a public affairs company that, among other things, runs a minor 
league baseball park in Lake Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way I can estimate how much value Dan Young has contributed to my 
board or this county, no way I can place a value on it. It's been spectacular," 
Oftelie said, adding that Young "led the charge" for passage of Measure M, a 
transportation tax that will fund road improvements for decades in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about it. Here in this toughest of counties, where there hadn't been a 
tax revenue increase since the Eisenhower Administration, Dan Young was totally 
instrumental in getting all the cities to sign on to this," Oftelie said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young, now 43, a 1969 Santa Ana High School graduate, became the longest 
serving mayor in the city's history, from 1988 until this fall. Although 
criticized by many in the city's booming Latino population as insensitive to 
ethnic issues, Young maintains that politics in Santa Ana are less divisive 
today than in 1983 when he took office as a councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said his legacy will be that he helped restore Santa Ana's schools by 
forging a city-school district partnership called Education First and buoyed 
the local economy through redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was threatened with recall because the redevelopment agency was subsidizing 
a redevelopment project called MainPlace," Young said. "Everyone said we were 
throwing money down a rat hole. . . . No one is questioning those things 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Hausdorfer became the second chairman of the OCTA board and managed to mesh 
the four formerly disparate transportation agencies together while smoothing 
out what easily could have been major rifts between competing egos, Oftelie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went smooth primarily because of Gary's extraordinary effort to make sure 
everyone was heard and everyone had a voice," Oftelie said. "Gary has a real 
gift . . . to be able to bring up the most contentious and controversial topic 
in a way that doesn't offend anybody. He has an ability to create harmony that 
is almost magical." 
</P>
<P>
 Hausdorfer, 48, a 16-year member of the San Juan Capistrano City Council, was 
the mayor for nearly five years, longer than anyone in the city's history. He 
helped forge a local coalition to pass a $21-million bond issue in 1990 to buy 
open space in the city to save it from development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time and only time in the history of the city that the 
residents approved a municipal tax," Hausdorfer said. "I'm proud of that, not 
only because I was able to play a major role, but for the long-term benefits. 
One hundred years from now, these open lands will still be part of San Juan 
Capistrano." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry is the other one of the six outgoing council members with the poise and 
ambition to pursue further objectives in politics. But Gentry, California's 
first openly gay elected official, acknowledged that he's in the wrong county 
for a political future and there was no way he would leave his beloved Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the public policy process, and I have a great love for local 
government. But I happen to be a registered Democrat and openly gay in one of 
the most conservative counties in the nation," said Gentry, 56. "I am not in 
the closet about my homosexuality or my party affiliation. But there are other 
ways to participate." Although many people in conservative Orange County do not 
like Gentry's liberal politics, few people doubt his courage. He said openness 
and honesty are the keys to local politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to always respect the process of democracy and the citizens 
involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many local politicians, it was back-yard issues that got Gentry, 
Hausdorfer, Wedaa and Hart involved at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry was trying to save two pine trees in a lot next to his home. Hausdorfer 
was upset about dirt generated by a nearby development project. Wedaa did not 
like the proliferation of apartments in his city. Hart was irked by litter on 
the beaches and the lack of local recreation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, 63, who arrived in Newport Beach from Pomona in 1952, also found herself 
unhappy about such other relatively mundane things as bike trails and the 
disrepair of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found myself wanting to make decisions for my city," said Hart, an activist 
for her homeowners association who got some support and won a seat on the 
Newport Beach City Council in 1978. It was the year of Proposition 13, and 
Hart, like council members around the state, was thrown into a budget crunch 
when tax monies no longer came to city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We immediately had to shift gears and balance our budget," she said. "We're 
going through the same things now. It's always money. If it's plentiful, you 
can do more things." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart went on to become chairwoman of the county's Local Agency Formation 
Commission, a member of the OCTA and the Orange County Republican Central 
Committee. Her focus had to shift from bike trails to more heady problems, such 
as turmoil in the city's Police Department and a city administrator embezzling 
public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evelyn is a great team player -- she doesn't seek the spotlight," said Jim 
Colangelo, for five years the executive director of LAFCO. "Of all the people I 
worked with in Orange County, I can't think of anybody who cared more about the 
job she was doing. The thing that always struck me, when she made a decision 
that was unpopular, she always wanted to go talk to the people and explain to 
them that she understood why they felt the way they did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa was the first among the six to become a council member, back in 1970 
when Yorba Linda was a tiny rural town of about 6,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa, a physicist from New Jersey who worked in aerospace, did not like the 
talk of a proliferation of apartments in rural, equestrian Yorba Linda. These 
were the early days of the slow-growth movement in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 24 years on the council, Yorba Linda grew to a city of 56,000, and 
built City Hall, a local library, the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace and 
kept its rural flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a big believer in large lots and low-density developments," said Wedaa, 
70. "I had the opportunity to build the kind of city that families want to live 
in. That was one of my goals and I think we succeeded admirably." 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa's brush with controversy came during one of his many regional posts -- 
his three-year reign as chairman of the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. He was criticized by environmentalists for being too lax, by business 
people as too onerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win at that job," he said. "But I think the bottom line is, people 
are breathing cleaner air in this county." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney, 53, a La Habra probate attorney who has lived in the city for 34 
years, is known for his staunch conservatism and sound judgment. He said he 
never sought involvement in politics and was convinced to run for the council 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 He wound up a major player in regional politics as a member of the OCTA board 
and nine-year member of the 42-member Orange County Sanitation Districts board, 
including three years as its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney's interest has always been in economic development, and within the 
past few months two new businesses, including the Super Kmart Center, have 
arrived in La Habra, opening up 1,000 new jobs, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Finances are what pays the bills and keeps things moving along," Mahoney 
said, adding, though, that it's the people on the staffs of local government 
who make or break the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who do the day-to-day work make these organizations perform," 
Mahoney said. "They are directly responsible and deserve the credit."

 "Nobody could pray to God there," said Voronel of Tustin. "The closest 
synagogue was 80 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Voronel and his family celebrated Hanukkah openly for the first 
time, free from persecution. The Voronels and eight other Jewish families who 
recently emigrated from Belarus, Tajikistan and other former Soviet republics 
gathered at a Hanukkah party hosted by the Jewish Family Service in Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 Children screamed and laughed, playing with the usual trappings of the holiday 
for tots: blue and white tinsel, gold-wrapped chocolate coins and presents. But 
there also were lessons for adults, many of whom were hearing for the first 
time about customs other Jews have practiced for years and years.  
</P>
<P>
 "Several years ago, people couldn't wear Jewish dress or learn about the 
traditions," said Valeria Babayeva, 55, who moved to Mission Viejo from Moscow 
three weeks ago. "I had friends who were arrested for studying Hebrew. I'm very 
happy to be here now."  
</P>
<P>
 Babayeva and her fellow refugees traded stories from their homelands and ate 
Jewish culinary treats, including latkes , or potato pancakes, and golf 
ball-sized sufganiyot , or jelly-filled doughnut holes.  
</P>
<P>
 Charlene Edwards, director of social services at the Jewish Family Service, 
said some Jews only knew about their faith because they remember hearing their 
grandparents talk about customs they had practiced before the Bolshevik 
Revolution in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hear stories about their identity long ago," Edwards said.  
</P>
<P>
 After the feast, established Jews from Orange County gave the newcomers a 
refresher course on the reason they were celebrating, the religious and 
historical significance of Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights. The holiday 
symbolizes Jews' freedom to worship. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members from the Jewish Family Service recruited a dozen of the 
newcomers' children to participate in a play that related the story of the 
rededication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem in 165 B.C. More than 2,000 
years ago, Syrians took over the temple and commanded Jews to worship Greek 
idols instead of their own God, Edwards told the audience. But a leader, Judas 
Maccabaeus, formed an army, defeated the Syrians and smashed the idols. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate, about a dozen children who played Jewish soldiers wearing blue 
yarmulkes waved neon pink plastic swords at three other children who played 
Syrians. "Yeaaaa!" yelled the victors when their foes fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jews needed to cleanse the temple, but only had enough oil to keep lights 
burning for one day, Edwards explained. According to legend, a miracle 
occurred: The flame burned for not one day, but eight. So Jews celebrate the 
victory, and the religious freedom it represents, by lighting candles on a 
menorah for eight consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Roth, executive director of the Jewish Family Service, showed the Jewish 
families how to light the menorah, and led the group in a chant as he topped 
each candle on a brass candelabra with a flickering flame. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some of these people, they grow up knowing they're Jewish because of 
prejudice against them," Roth said. "It's written on their passports and 
documents." 
</P>
<P>
 But after perestroika and glasnost , some people in the former Soviet 
republics started to gather to rediscover their Jewish faith. Young Jews 
visited other nations to learn Jewish traditions; others listened to rabbis who 
traveled through Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I discovered Judaism," said Irina Shulkin, 31. "If you learn your roots, you 
start to love who you are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Behind you is a whole history, with a lot of heroes, and it makes me proud," 
said Shulkin, who emigrated from Lvov, Ukraine, three years ago and is now 
learning Hebrew. "For the people who grew up speaking it, it's their native 
language and nothing special. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for me," Shulkin said, "it's definitely a big deal."

STREET SMART / RICHARD SIMON: YOU CAN FILL UP IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE AT NEW 
BREED OF SERVICE STATION

 Regular, ethyl or cafe latte?  
</P>
<P>
 At Charles Khalil's gas station, you can now sit down at a table and sip 
cappuccino while filling your tank. 
</P>
<P>
 It's on Los Angeles' Westside, naturally, offering not merely premium coffee 
but gourmet cheese, fine wine, fresh flowers and holiday gift baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalil is not the only gas dealer to trade in his grease rack for a $15,000 
espresso machine. Gas dealers throughout Southern California -- who once relied 
on Blue Chip stamps, free glassware and other giveaways to attract business -- 
are finding new ways to appeal to customers' tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Unocal station at the Grapevine, customers can order a Nathan's Famous 
hot dog over a "talking pump." 
</P>
<P>
 The economic benefits of trying to refuel humans, not just machines, are 
clear: 16% of restaurant meals sold in the United States are ordered from 
automobiles; 10% are eaten in the car, according to a Chicago-area marketing 
firm, NPD Crest, which tracks the consumer habits of 13,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear whether the automobile is moving or stopped when the meal is 
being eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why car makers added cup holders. 
</P>
<P>
 And consider this new product arriving just in time for Christmas: a bib for 
commuters. It absorbs spills and contains a wide pocket to catch crumbs. 
(Rolls-Royces have trays for back-seat passengers, but no one has yet proposed 
trays in front.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, gas stations for years have sold items such as cigarettes, chewing 
gum and soda pop. But sales of food and other specialty items gained popularity 
only during the oil shortages of the 1970s. Stations underwent a 
transformation, from places where a friendly attendant would pump your gas, 
clean your windshield, check your oil and give you Blue Chip stamps to a place 
where you pay first to a stone-faced attendant behind a high-security window 
and then serve yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps speculating that energy-conscious drivers would want to avoid buying 
gas and then driving elsewhere for food and groceries, Arco opened its first 
AM/PM Mini Market in 1975 at the corner of Brookhurst Street and Trask Avenue 
in Garden Grove. It's still there (though no one has proposed that it be 
declared a landmark like Brentwood's famous Spanish Colonial-style gas 
station), and these days Arco rakes in about $500 million a year from sales of 
items in nearly 900 AM/PM Mini Market in five Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't open stores now that have just gasoline," said Arco spokesman Al 
Greenstein. "It is simply not as profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything and everything that is a convenience to the consumer is being 
tried," said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Los Angeles-based Lundberg 
Letter, which tracks petroleum and consumer trends. 
</P>
<P>
 One new trend is fast-food restaurants at gas stations. Rally's hamburgers are 
slung at a Unocal in Lakewood. Dunkin Donuts are sold out of a Mobil in 
Brentwood. And at a Texaco in Carson -- across the street, ironically, from the 
Arco refinery -- customers can buy a Subway sandwich or a Taco Bell burrito, 
withdraw cash from an ATM, shop for groceries . . . oh, yes, and fill their 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of selling cappuccino at a gas station began in the Pacific 
Northwest, according to industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fairly big up there, and it's just now coming down here in Southern 
California," said Ron Sharp, merchandising specialist for Chevron USA Products 
Co. Indeed, cappuccino carts have shown up at some stations in Riverside and 
San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But few gas dealers have gone as far as Khalil, whose Mobil station is at 
Olympic and Westwood boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalil said he got the do-it-yourself cappuccino machine because he wanted to 
improve the gasoline buying experience -- and maximize his bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see the trend," said Khalil, a Lebanese immigrant who admittedly 
doesn't know how to change a tire. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think of a gas station, the first thing you think of probably is the 
smell. Gas stinks," he noted. But now, the smell of brewing coffee wafts 
through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to create something that truly fits the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 A cup of cappuccino or cafe latte sells for $1.50. A single espresso is 99 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't stop at the cappuccino machine, said Khalil, who invites visitors to 
see the bathroom. It is decorated Grecian style with imitation marble tile and 
plaster columns and automated sensors that activate the sink and toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalil's wife, Kaaren, said the couple is contemplating a "cut-through" window 
where the magazine rack is now, installing a deli there so you can yell out 
your sandwich selection from the pump and get it after your fill-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal is testing a TV screen on gas pumps at a station in Saugus. The talking 
screen instructs customers how to use the pump, but also plays commercials -- 
without, they insist, subliminal advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, there have been no reports of Southern California gas station 
owners imitating their British counterparts.  
</P>
<P>
 In some British stations, motorists are treated to a free five-minute massage 
of the head, shoulders and hands aimed at "alleviating stress and combatting 
road rage among drivers." British officials point out that road rage was first 
identified in America.

EDELMAN LEGACY: YEARS OF QUIET ACCOMPLISHMENT; POLITICS: CONCILIATORY 
SUPERVISOR'S VICTORIES WERE WON WITHOUT FANFARE. HE REJECTS CLAIMS HE HAS NOT 
BEEN STRONG ENOUGH LIBERAL VOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly 30 years in public office, Ed Edelman still seems ill at ease 
with the sort of press-the-flesh interplay expected of a successful politician. 
</P>
<P>
 His expressions can sometimes seem stilted and inelegant, and his words are 
surprisingly halting. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Los Angeles County supervisor, who retired Friday, stood in his 
office away from the confines of the board's hearing room one day last week, he 
was far more relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 He skirted packed boxes, eagerly showing a guest the portrait of himself with 
President Jimmy Carter en route to Washington on Air Force One, a pen used by 
President John F. Kennedy to sign key labor legislation and the telegram 
inviting him and his wife, Mari, to Washington for the signing of the 
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, here's Pete Wilson bowing down to me," he says, laughing at a snapshot 
of the governor stretching out his arm for a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman is animated and engaging, a far cry from his cautious, scholarly, 
hardly-like-a-politician-at-all public persona. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while he is considered politically astute, Edelman's perceived lack of 
fire in the belly is the biggest rap against him. His critics, and even some 
friends, say he is too lawyerly, too much of a compromiser and too unwilling to 
get fired up to fight for the liberal vision of Los Angeles County he has long 
espoused. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he departs the office he held for 20 years, he is betting that a record 
of good works, accomplished quietly and with little flair, will dominate future 
examinations of the Edelman legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many times overshadowed by more colorful colleagues such as folksy 
Kenneth Hahn and fiery Gloria Molina, Edelman has often been ahead of the curve 
in championing such things as protections for abused children, consumers, AIDS 
patients and others who lack political clout. But to the chagrin of many fellow 
liberals, he has done so without really shaking up the entrenched system in 
which he has worked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He is perhaps most tormented by the nasty redistricting battle of 1990, in 
which he was cast as a civil rights foe. A federal judge ruled that Edelman and 
his colleagues intentionally discriminated against Latinos in drawing district 
boundaries in order to protect their own seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman's Westside supervisorial district was redrawn and the final map spared 
him from a potential Latino challenge that he had feared. Even so, some accused 
him of fighting to save his own political hide at the expense of enfranchising 
the county's Latino residents.  
</P>
<P>
 Edelman calls criticism of his position "political hype" and a "superficial 
analysis of the issue."  
</P>
<P>
 Even some of his critics agree that he was in a difficult spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were moments during the litigation that we were angry with him, but we 
understood why he did some of the things he did, and toward the end he became a 
friend," says Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 And concerning his failure to change the system? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed was in a very difficult position. . . . Even if he had tried more, I don't 
think he could have accomplished much," she says. "He probably did as much as 
he could given the (conservative) composition of the board." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some contend that Edelman settled far too easily into a 
go-along-to-get-along style common on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The persistent joke around the Hall of Administration is that his greatest 
legacy to the county is Pasqua's, an upscale sandwich shop he lobbied for. 
</P>
<P>
 After liberals grabbed a majority on the five-member board two years ago, 
critics say, Edelman failed to provide much leadership. And as he leaves 
office, the county is still grappling with an increasing homeless problem, 
welfare benefits have been slashed to the bone and cuts continue to be made in 
other social programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Just where Edelman, 64, will fit in the firmament of Los Angeles' political 
notables is unclear.  
</P>
<P>
 But many are already bemoaning his departure, seeing him as one of the last 
vestiges of a certain style of decorum in government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed represents . . . a civil approach to public policy that is getting more 
and more scarce," says Larry Berg, a professor of political science and 
director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman is well aware of both the negative and positive aspects of his public 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been accused of being a mediator and conciliator, and I accept that," he 
says. "But I think people have underestimated my willingness to be the single 
vote on an issue. I have raised my voice on behalf of causes that needed to be 
heard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also feels that his style has worked well within the restrained confines of 
county government, where he has often been on the wrong side of a conservative 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have stayed here for all of these years had I not thought I was 
being effective," he says. "I haven't won them all, but I've raised the issues, 
I've worked the system." 
</P>
<P>
 First elected to the Los Angeles City Council in 1965, Edelman has frequently 
championed liberal causes that ran counter to public opinion, for example 
opposing the popular tax-cutting Proposition 13 and advocating increased taxes 
to support health and welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he has lost his share of battles, he has won many, including an 
anti-AIDS-discrimination law, establishment of the county Commission for Women 
and funding for the Hollywood Bowl and other arts programs. He was instrumental 
in creation of a special court in Monterey Park to handle cases of child abuse, 
and in pushing for formation of the Kolts Commission, which led to reforms in 
the Sheriff's Department after allegations of brutality were reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 But those achievements have been won in relative anonymity. If they were asked 
to name a prominent local politician, it is not likely Edelman would spring to 
the minds of most county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Ballenger, onetime press deputy to the retiring supervisor, sees two 
opposing impulses in his former boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't want to be viewed as the typical politician," says Ballenger, an 
executive assistant with the county's Department of Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hates to grandstand, but at the same time he wants the credit and 
recognition for accomplishments. I think he is one of the most underappreciated 
politicians in Los Angeles, but I think he will be respected more in 
retrospect." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ballenger believes that Edelman suffers in comparison to someone like former 
Supervisor Hahn, whose affable style ensured popularity and a ready spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kenny's style was: If something happened, bring a motion in at the next board 
meeting," Ballenger says. "He was a fast, reactive politician. Ed didn't work 
that way. He was much more behind the scenes: What are the problems and what is 
the best way to solve this." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn is effusive in his praise for his colleague and those very same 
behind-the-scenes skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a very judicial mind, and every time the board was in a conflict of 
decision he would go into executive session and come up with the right 
solution," says the 74-year-old Hahn, who retired two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Edelman who urged Hahn to return to work after a serious stroke in 
1987. "I said, 'Ed, don't you know my left side is paralyzed and I can't walk,' 
and he told me if FDR could run a country and win a war in a wheelchair I could 
come back to the county and help run it," remembers Hahn. "It was like a 
command, and I did it. I really looked to Ed for leadership and to be the point 
man on issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman was fair almost to a fault, says Hahn. "One time we had a particularly 
difficult case of zoning. . . . Ed had got three of us to vote with him, but he 
wanted to continue the case. I said, 'Ed, what's wrong with you? You've got the 
votes.' But he wanted to hear all sides on the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Fisher served for four years on the county Regional Planning Commission 
as an Edelman appointee and says he never second-guessed her, even if their 
views on an issue did not entirely mesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pretty much of the same mind, but still, he was willing to take 
guidance from my insights and to understand what I was trying to do when I was 
there," says Fisher, who is now chief deputy to Councilwoman Ruth Galanter.  
</P>
<P>
 One hallmark of Edelman's tenure seems to be that he was able to get along 
with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed is a reasonably liberal Democrat and I could be described as a terrible 
conservative, probably as philosophically as far apart as anyone. Yet there was 
never an occasion where I dealt with Ed that was not completely comfortable," 
says Richard Dixon, the county's former chief administrative officer, who 
resigned under a cloud of criticism for his financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time I ever saw him unhappy with someone was when they wouldn't tell 
him (their) honest opinion. He and I never had any friction, because I do speak 
my mind and he appreciated that. He never personally attacked me and treated me 
the same way when I had a good solid, board majority as when I didn't have any 
majority at all." 
</P>
<P>
 In retirement, Edelman will return to his roots, working part-time as a 
professional mediator and joining the RAND Corp. as a fellow on public policy 
issues. He clearly wants to maintain a role in county politics and could become 
the closest thing Los Angeles has to Jimmy Carter, a distinguished elder sought 
after to resolve seemingly intractable disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a love of public policy issues and in seeing improvements," says 
Edelman. "I'm not just going to walk out and say goodby. I want to be a voice."

MERRY MOTORCYCLING; HARLEY-DAVIDSON ENTHUSIASTS PARADE IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The holiday season came in with a thundering roar Sunday, as thousands of 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle enthusiasts were welcomed to exclusive Rodeo Drive, 
in Beverly Hills' first-ever black leather Christmas parade -- at least the 
first official one. 
</P>
<P>
 The unorthodox celebration -- "Happy Harley Days/Rejoice on Rodeo" -- brought 
Harley fans of all types, from "Rolex riders" to Hells Angels, to the parade 
and bike show. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, in conjunction with Los Angeles Harley-Davidson and Permanent 
Charities, was expected to raise $50,000 for Camp Ronald McDonald for Good 
Times, a program for children with cancer and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 From perhaps the only tattoo booth in Beverly Hills, camp counselor Nicole 
(Corky) Lesley hailed potential customers, offering temporary rub-on tattoos 
for $2 and $4 to give people the Harley look -- for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Business had been marginal: "We keep trying to get people to get (the 
rub-ons), but they're all saying, 'No, we already have the real ones,' " she 
lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodeo Drive, with its reputation as the shopping mecca of the polished, 
pampered and bejeweled, was a sea of black leather jackets as bikers -- some 
wearing Santa hats over their helmets -- joined gawkers, strolling down the 
street and sipping gourmet coffee after the block-long parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an unusual sight," admitted Beverly Hills Councilman Tom Levyn as he 
and his children sat on the curb and watched the parade, led by actress Cher 
astride her own Harley. "I never thought Rodeo Drive would be taken over by 
bikers, but it certainly is fun and everyone is in the holiday spirit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Camp Ronald McDonald officials, no one was more joyous than the Rodeo 
Drive merchants association, which gauged the event with a decidedly commercial 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demographics showed us that the average Harley-Davidson owner has a 
household income of $100,000 a year, and their average age is between 35 and 40 
years," said John Petterson, president of the Rodeo Drive Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, affluent bikers are just the clientele Rodeo Drive needs, he said. 
Petterson, vice president of Tiffany & Co., added: "In fact, many of these 
Harley owners already live, shop and dine in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob and Mary Beth Van Dine were just the bikers the merchants association had 
in mind for Happy Harley Days. The couple, preparing to join the procession of 
about 1,600 gleaming Harleys on their chrome-decked monster, said they lived in 
Beverly Hills before moving to Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came today because I wanted a picture of my bike out in front of Carroll & 
Co., where I buy my clothes," said Bob Van Dine, vice president of St. Ives, a 
company that sells hair and body care products. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the owner of four Harley-Davidsons, he said: "We figured out that we have 
more money in motorcycles than we spent on our first house."

SURFBOARDS BUILT FOR TWO; COUPLES HANG TWENTY AS TANDEM SPORT RESURFACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Jason Peters swung his 94-pound female partner over his head and onto his 
shoulders with one graceful, seamless effort, then held her as she hooked one 
small foot around his arm and extended the other into a perfect point. 
</P>
<P>
 All this while riding a fast-moving, crashing wave onto shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt incredible," Peters said of the perfect tandem surfing lift, the 
"arrow," that he and partner Mel Ferrer completed Sunday at the U.S. Team 
Trials at the San Onofre State Beach. "We hit it and it felt so solid. It was 
liberating. It as like we were on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 But even better was learning that the Dana Point couple's performance Sunday 
won them a trip to France along with four other local American couples to 
compete at the European Biarritz Surf Festival next July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The tandem surfing event included eight teams, all doing breath-taking lifts 
to the cheers of a crowd of about 40 who braved the chilly December air. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle was proof that tandem surfing, an almost-forgotten art that 
combines gymnastics with wave-riding, is enjoying a rebirth in Orange County, 
where it was introduced in the 1930s by two local surfers. Now the American 
sport is about to be given international exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides surfing for the European title, the five couples will introduce tandem 
surfing as a new sport to Europe, said Steve Boehne, 47, of Dana Point, who, 
along with his wife, Bari, 46, organized and helped judge the event Sunday. The 
two are the reigning tandem surfing world champions, and are considered the 
best tandem trainers in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight local couples who competed Sunday were trained by the Boehnes. The 
other winners Sunday included Mark and Debbie Gale of Capistrano Beach; Bobby 
Friedman of Dana Point and Anna Shisler of San Clemente; and Chris and Steve 
Farwell of Costa Mesa. All of them are looking forward to showing off the 
American sport, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boehnes will be the fifth couple heading for France because of their 
championship status. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great opportunity to show the world something new and be a part of 
history," Shisler said. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting it big in the 1960s, the sport, which requires a larger than 
average board, at least nine feet, fell out of favor with the advent of 
shorter, more maneuverable boards that became popular with high school and 
college-age kids in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got so that if you showed up on the beach with a long board, you'd be 
ridiculed," Boehne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd say, 'You geek with the long board, get out of here,' " added John 
Taylor of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, 47, a former tandem surfing world champion, is credited along with the 
Boehnes with carrying the torch for tandem surfing to its present resurgence. 
All three began tandem surfing in their teens during the sport's heyday in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four years, with their encouragement, long board and tandem 
surfing teams and competitions have begun springing up in most beach towns in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Boehne attributed tandem surfing's comeback to the increasing popularity of 
long boards among surfers in their 30s and 40s who no longer have the 
incredible agility that short boards require, but want to keep surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 The die-hards brought the boards back to the beach despite the sneers, Boehne 
said, and as long boards started regaining popularity, so did tandem surfing. 
Now tandem is spreading to Orange County kids as young as 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers compare the sport to pairs figure skating, but with the added 
challenge of gliding on an unpredictable burst of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors are judged on wave-riding, presentation and the degree of 
difficulty of their lifts. Successful partners often include women who have 
gymnastics or ballet training. The men tend to be muscle-bound and the women 
petite. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport has always remained popular in Hawaii, where it began in Waikiki in 
the 1920s when "beach boys," handsome young surfers hired by local hotels to 
entertain guests, would take female tourists out on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's Pete Peterson and his friend Lorin Harrison, both now deceased, 
are credited with bringing the sport to Huntington Beach in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Most surfers said they loved the way the sport combines getting out into 
nature, tough training and a little romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot of fun," Friedman said. "Men with muscles and women in bikinis 
-- what could be better?"

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; TROY HIGH SCHOOL TO HOLD BLOOD DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troy High School is sponsoring a blood drive Thursday that is named for an 
accident victim, both as a tribute to her and to raise awareness about the 
dangers of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The Linda Bloedel Blood Drive will be from 8 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. on the high 
school campus at 2200 E. Dorothy Lane. The public is encouraged to donate 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloedel, 33, a mother of three, was hit by a drunk driver last month while 
driving home from work. Her car was so badly damaged that emergency crews had 
to pry her out. She was rushed to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where she was 
treated for massive head and body injuries and internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 She credits donated blood with saving her life, which is why Bloedel's friends 
decided to honor her with the blood drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a goodwill gesture," Shaun Hughes said. "We hope this blood drive 
will help other people who need blood to survive accidents like Linda's and 
maybe make people think twice before deciding to drive while drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make people think about how drunk driving can wreak havoc in 
the family and in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloedel, who is recovering at home, is bedridden and still suffering from a 
broken skull, pelvis, spine and neck. She has had to stop nursing her 
5-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things can happen so quickly, and they can change your life," Bloedel said. 
"I think the blood drive is just wonderful, because when I needed blood, I got 
it, and it saved my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty scary to be hit by a drunk driver. I feel very fortunate to be 
alive and I hope when people go out to party and have fun that they not drive 
while drunk, because they can hurt or even kill other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Gadd, 17, who is organizing the blood drive, said that 150 people have 
already signed up as donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll get a lot more donors because of Linda," she said.MIMI KO

<P>
 The city tentatively has agreed to amend its settlement with the county over 
noise from John Wayne Airport to allow 10 cargo flight departures a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors is expected to give final approval Tuesday to 
a plan that will allow United Parcel Service and Federal Express to operate 
all-cargo jetliners at John Wayne Airport, possibly as soon as the end of the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The amended settlement would allow each freight line to send one flight a day 
out of the airport on weekdays through the 1997 access plan year. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, Newport Beach City Atty. Robert Burnham said, the county will not 
extend any runways at the airport during those two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-year-old settlement agreement, reached in a federal lawsuit, and the 
county's Phase 2 Access Plan had limited departing flights by noise-regulated 
aircraft to 73 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 The amended settlement terms the two daily cargo flights as "interim." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach has steadfastly opposed cargo operations at John Wayne Airport, 
contending the county's Environmental Management Agency did not adequately 
consider the use of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station as a commercial airport.  
</P>
<P>
 The settlement deal does not rule out that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's decision assumes "the willingness of UPS and Federal 
Express to consider cargo operations at El Toro upon the elimination of any 
political or legal obstacle to joint use," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's agreement to the deal is contingent on confirmation from the 
Federal Aviation Administration that the changes do not violate a 1990 federal 
law governing plane noise and capacity. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 Police officers and Explorer Scouts on Tuesday will clean and repair an 
elderly woman's house, which was vandalized by a local gang that includes her 
daughter, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not identify the woman, but said her 35-year-old daughter invited 
members of the 17th Street Gang to live in the house while her mother was 
vacationing in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. Dave Abrecht said the gang members destroyed the inside of the 
house and rendered it uninhabitable. The daughter, who has a criminal history, 
was arrested for outstanding warrants and is being held at County Jail, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrecht said that the clean-up effort will demonstrate that "we will not 
tolerate the senseless, destructive and violent behavior . . . of gang members 
who have no regard for people and their property." 
</P>
<P>
 Code enforcement officials and volunteers also will help clean the home on 
Havenwood Street. BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Juan M. Garcia will begin his third year on the City Council as the city's 
first Latino mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 His colleagues on the council voted unanimously last week to give Garcia, 42, 
the mostly ceremonial post, in which he will conduct meetings, award 
proclamations and represent the city at special events.Steven C. Anderson will 
serve as mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia now leads a city in which 34% of the population is Latino, according to 
1990 U.S. Census figures. City officials said, however, now estimate that 
number at 40% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that by my being mayor now, Latinos might feel a little more at ease 
in coming to City Hall and addressing their concerns," Garcia said. "I come 
from a background that gives me a very good understanding of the culture, and I 
will try to be as consistent and fair as possible, regardless of what a 
person's race or background might be." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said that he will ask the the council next month for a list of goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will put (the goals) up on a chalkboard and start trying to ensure that all 
are going to be met," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who was born in Nueva Rosita, Mexico, has lived in La Habra since 
1957. He and his wife, Kathy, have a daughter, Stephanie, 16, and son, Adam, 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 The new mayor attended La Habra High School and graduated from Cal State 
Fullerton with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1979. He is a 
business coordinator at Chevron Petroleum Technology Co. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOL BOARD TO STUDY DARE PROGRAM AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The school board Tuesday will again tackle what has become an increasingly 
controversial issue: a DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program for 
middle school students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Teachers Assn. is opposed to the $90,000 program, which would be 
funded equally by the city and the Irvine Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers haven't had a raise in three years," said school board President 
Michael B. Regele. "But they also realize that $45,000 is a drop in the bucket. 
I think it's a symbolic protest." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board backed away from taking a vote on the program Nov. 15 after 
questions were raised about the effectiveness of DARE in preventing students 
from using drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a growing number of reports that have been critical of DARE," 
Regele said. "You have to ask yourself, 'Is this the best way to get here from 
there?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The program was approved by middle school teachers last month who reviewed the 
DARE curriculum. It was planned to begin during the current school year in 
eighth-grade physical education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Tom Burnham said a delay in implementing the program is 
unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DARE program is not only an education program, it's also a community 
policing program to put kids in touch with police officers," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the cost of the program, Irvine Unified is considering assigning a 
district teacher who also is a reserve Irvine police officer to teach the 
class.RUSS LOAR

<P>
 A few vulgar, silly rhymes, a few expletives, a few initials -- all were once 
spray-painted underneath the Hamilton Street bridge along the Santa Ana River 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the wall is adorned by a huge mural of a roller-blader stopping on a 
dime, with sun and waves in the background, thanks to 20 art students from 
Century High School in Santa Ana who felt like burning off a little artistic 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Their art teacher, Ross McElfresh, sketched the mural and helped paint it over 
three consecutive Saturdays. A ceremony was held last week to celebrate its 
completion under Operation Clean Slate. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Environmental Management Agency provided bright orange traffic 
cones to forewarn bikers that artists were at work, and sandbags to keep the 
river from reaching the precious paint during high tides. 
</P>
<P>
 Lily Hoang, 15, a sophomore, said the work was her way of helping the 
community. Rhonda Espinosa, 16, a junior, said she took up the brush because 
she liked the idea that it was a group working toward a common good. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Howard, a math teacher at Orange County Juvenile Hall, started Operation 
Clean Slate, a growing program to clean up graffiti and replace it with murals. 
</P>
<P>
 The year-old program is intended to impress upon students all over the county 
that art can be an alternative to graffiti.  
</P>
<P>
 Ken Stokesberry, coordinator of student activities at Century High, thought 
the message might be sinking in. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we finished the mural we forgot about the paint and brushes and left 
them out. And you know what? When we came back, nobody had touched it or 
painted over it or ruined it. Isn't that great?"TOM RAGAN

 The Orange County Fire Department is asking homeowners to prevent fires during 
the winter by maintaining chimneys and furnaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials recommend the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chimneys should be cleaned every year by a reputable professionals.Creosote, 
a flammable oily build-up commonly found in chimney chutes, is a contributing 
factor to some house fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Older chimneys should be inspected carefully for cracks and flaws. Such small 
openings can allow fire to seep into walls and onto roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 * All chimneys should have a spark arresters to prevent sparks from landing on 
the roof. Shaped like a chimney cap with a mesh screen to prevent sparks from 
escaping, spark arresters can be purchased at most hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials recommend against purchasing a flat spark arrester screen, 
where tree leaves and branches can settle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trim tree branches away from the chimney area. Keep dry leaves and trash off 
the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep a protective screen on the fireplace hearth to prevent flying sparks 
from igniting carpet and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Furnaces should be completely cleaned every year with a vacuum cleaner and 
all filters replaced. An unusual noise, odor or erratic performance should be 
repaired promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 * The gas company will inspect and adjust all natural gas fire equipment at no 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be careful to keep electric space heaters at least three feet from any 
paper, clothing, furniture or flammable liquids.

7 HELD IN RAID ON METHAMPHETAMINE LAB IN POMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pomona police raided a clandestine drug laboratory just one block from 
department headquarters early Sunday morning, arresting seven people and 
seizing about $50,000 worth of increasingly popular methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, officers swooped down on the lab shortly after midnight, also 
confiscating several guns along with the chemicals used to make the illicit 
stimulant, said Lt. Greg Hamill. Police estimated that the lab was producing 
about half a pound, or $50,000 worth, of the drug daily, but they did not know 
how long the facility had been operating. 
</P>
<P>
 Long the drug of choice among outlaw biker gangs, methamphetamine has become 
popular among some teen-agers hooked by its potent, addictive high. A central 
nervous system stimulant, methamphetamine is similar in effect to cocaine, but 
its high can last much longer, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be coming back and spreading outside of the biker gangs," 
Hamill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug -- known on the street as speed, crank, tweak or ice -- is easily 
manufactured with chemicals largely available at drugstores. It is often 
snorted but can be smoked or injected. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested at the Pomona lab were Richard Fraley, 27; Mario Baca, 23; Leonard 
Gutierrez, 24; Dustin Kordeki, 20; Dereke Beellen, 18, and two juveniles whose 
names and ages were not released, Hamill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were allegedly working in a back-yard toolshed, which is 
separated from police headquarters by a fire station and a National Guard 
armory. Hamill said the lab may have only recently been set up because police 
had not received complaints about strong chemical odors common in such 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 As officers approached the shed from an alley, he said, they could smell the 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's action was the latest in a number of lab seizures in the east San 
Gabriel Valley, which authorities say has one of the highest concentrations of 
speed labs in the nation. Nearly three-fourths of the labs raided this year by 
a regional task force in four Southern California counties have been in the 
east San Gabriel Valley.

<P>
 Laguna Hills High School topped 47 other high school teams to win the annual 
Orange County Academic Decathlon for the seventh straight year.  
</P>
<P>
 Results of the academic tournament, held Nov. 19, were announced at an awards 
ceremony last week at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim.The Laguna Hills team 
qualified for the state championship in March in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not satisfied with the county championship," said Gene Bastnagel, one 
of three seniors on the team. "We want to win the state and national 
championships." 
</P>
<P>
 Each team consisted of nine students: three with A averages, three with B 
averages and three with C averages. They competed in mathematics, science, 
social science, economics, language, literature, fine arts, essays, interviews 
and speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills scored 48,505 points out of a possible 60,000 points. Trabuco 
Hills High School was second with 44,161 points, and Sunny Hills finished third 
with 44,306 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley High School won Division II with 36,577 points, followed by 
Orange High School with 34,958 points and Brea-Olinda with 33,848 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave up a lot of social hours, a lot of TV and a lot of parties," said 
Khanh Bui, adding that the team studied more than 30 hours a week to prepare 
for the tournament. "Now, we've moving to the next level," she said. "It will 
take a lot of hard work, but it's great." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 schools are expected to compete in the state championship, where 
Laguna Hills finished third last year. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COMA VICTIM'S FAMILY GRATEFUL FOR 
SUPPORT 
</P>

<P>
 Donna Tomlinson hasn't abandoned hope that one day her 26-year-old daughter 
will come out of the coma she has been in since February, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Tomlinson was injured when the car she was riding in was hit head-on by 
a drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family has refused to place her in an institution. Instead, for the past 
two years, Tomlinson has been caring for her daughter at their home. Tomlinson 
and her husband, Steve, along with other relatives, have dedicated their lives 
to giving Cindy Tomlinson the 24-hour care she needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see improvement," Donna Tomlinson said. "It's been slow, but she's making 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her daughter smiles and stays awake during the day, in a 
semi-comatose state, although doctors say she is in a coma.  
</P>
<P>
 But taking care of Cindy Tomlinson at home has taken a financial toll on her 
family. Medical costs are ongoing, including the hiring of nurses to help with 
her care. 
</P>
<P>
 To help offset the costly medical bills, the family held a fund-raiser 
Wednesday at the local El Torito restaurant. El Torito is donating 25% of 
guests' checks to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Tomlinson, who stays up at least three nights a week to care for her 
daughter, said the public's outpouring of support and generosity over the past 
two years has helped the family get through the trying times. 
</P>
<P>
 She said people have donated time to help with her daughter's nursing care and 
therapy and contributed to a fund at Fidelity Federal Bank in Placentia to pay 
for her medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the people out there in the community who have helped. Just their 
believing in Cindy has been really important to me," she said. "I'm grateful 
for the supporters and all the prayers that have been said for Cindy." DEBRA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY PICKS 10 PROJECTS FOR FUNDING REQUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A housing improvement program for low- and moderate-income residents is at the 
top of the list of community projects city officials hope to launch in fiscal 
year 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects would be financed with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development's Community Development Block Grants, which are designed to 
revitalize neighborhoods, spur economic growth and provide facilities and 
services for low- and moderate-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week voted to seek more than $500,000 in block grants 
from Orange County, which administers the federal program for small cities. 
With a population of just over 12,000, Los Alamitos does not receive the grants 
directly, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the money requested, $60,000 would be set aside for the home improvements 
in the form of low-interest loans, deferred payment loans and grants. Another 
$60,000 would be available for business improvements, such as new storefronts, 
signs, parking and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest chunk, $100,000, would be used to put underground utility lines in 
the Apartment Row, Carrier Row, Old Town West and Old Town East neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Elizabeth Binsack said that all projects may 
not be funded. During the 1994-95 fiscal year, the city requested $450,000 for 
nine projects but received only $80,000 for five projects. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that, of the 10 projects submitted for funding, it is likely that 
just four or five may be allocated money. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposed projects include the improvement of alleys between Bloomfield 
Street and Lexington Drive, alleys at Old Town West and renovation of Little 
Cottonwood, Roberts, Sterns and Soroptimist parks. BERT ELJERA

MAIL THEFT AND FORGERY ARE ON RISE, POLICE WARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a frantic Buena Park woman discovered that her checking account had been 
cleaned out by a check forger -- on the day before her wedding -- police Sunday 
issued a warning: Mail theft and forgery are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last month or two we have been getting calls every day on forgeries 
in progress," said Sgt. Jeff Kingsbury of the Buena Park Police Department. 
"It's not just a problem in Buena Park, it's happening all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually in the darkness of night, thieves canvass neighborhoods or business 
parks searching mailboxes for checks and credit cards, Kingsbury said. With 
phony identifications and chemicals, the checks can then be altered and cashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people work in the middle of the night," Kingsbury said. "They collect 
mail, sort through it and 'wash' the checks they find, cleaning everything off 
but the signature." 
</P>
<P>
 A Buena Park Police Department female employee who left several checks in 
envelopes in the mailbox overnight recently lost $6,400, Kingsbury said. One 
check was later altered from $80 to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case last Friday, the day before her wedding, 21-year-old Kristen 
Andersen of Buena Park discovered her checking account had been emptied by 
someone forging stolen checks, Kingsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of money going into this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrests are being made, and police believe that two men being held in Orange 
County Jail on suspicion of possession of stolen property and forgery were 
practicing the scam, Kingsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Alado, 23, and Real Sabio Tojot, 23, both of Long Beach, were arrested 
about 5:50 a.m. Nov. 25 by police who found more than 100 stolen items in their 
car, including checks, credit cards, bank access cards and Social Security 
cards, and a small amount of methamphetamine, according to Kingsbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Police advise that no mail be left in mailboxes overnight, and that checks, 
credit card slips or identifying information be torn up before being discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone sees someone going through mailboxes at night, call the police," 
Kingsbury said.

MAN SHOT AND WOUNDED IN RESIDENTIAL AREA OF BREA; 2 MEN SEEN FLEEING SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 33-year-old man was shot at least twice and left bleeding on a street, 
authorities said Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 The man, whom police did not identify, underwent surgery after he was shot on 
the 1800 block of Moorpark Street about 8:40 p.m. Saturday.Brea police said the 
man was lying on the pavement in the residential area when units arrived. His 
parked car was discovered nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a high-crime area," Lt. Douglas Dickerson said. "We usually don't 
have problems there." 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses told police they saw two men flee, Dickerson said. They were 
last seen driving away in what appeared to be a maroon-colored large 
American-made sedan, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 A Brea Fire Department helicopter airlifted the man to a local hospital, 
Dickerson said. Surgeons operated on him Sunday morning, and he remained in 
intensive care Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are not releasing the victim's name or the name of the hospital where 
he was taken because they fear his attacker or attackers may try to retaliate, 
Dickerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea police investigators are following several leads and hope to talk to the 
shooting victim to get more details on the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no known motive for the shooting, and no weapons were recovered at 
the scene.

LEGAL REPRESENTATION RULES TO BE CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a step toward possibly replacing the city's legal firm, council members 
will meet tonight to consider the requirements for any new firm representing 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has contracted legal services from Rourke, Woodruff & Spradlin for 
more than three decades.Councilman Jim Potts said that after such a long time, 
the city now needs "to see what's out there." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager William A. Huston presented a draft list of qualifications for 
legal firms at the last council meeting. Discussion on the matter was 
postponed, however, so Potts and Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli could both submit 
revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agree that legal matters will take on increasing importance in 
coming years as the city grapples with complex land use issues, such as the 
future of the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station. ALAN EYERLY

HE'S GLAD HE'S GONE; PACERS' JACKSON SAYS PLAYERS MUST SHARE MUCH OF THE BLAME 
FOR THE CLIPPERS' DISMAL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a scowl and a pretzel, Mark Jackson was in no mood for kidding around. 
There he sat in front of his locker at the Sports Arena, hearing the latest 
Clipper joke. 
</P>
<P>
 The one about the Clippers losing their television deal with Channel 13? Yeah, 
they're moving to the Comedy Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson must have found it quite unfunny because he had this unpleasant look 
on his face, gosh, like somebody forgot to put some mustard on that pregame 
pretzel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to trash that team," Jackson said. "That's not my job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows about management and the mistakes that they've made. 
Everybody knows how that is." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, we know. The Clippers aren't funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Winless, maybe, but also humorless. As an Indiana Pacer, Jackson is one former 
Clipper who isn't laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ex-Clipper Club has a long and glorious roster of those who signed up for 
any number of valid reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were released, some were traded or retired, and some simply got out of 
town faster than you could say unrestricted free agent. Or the instant their 
contracts ran out, whichever came first. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's membership falls under the trade category. He couldn't wait to go, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very blessed to be out of here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, three weeks before the end of last season, Jackson said he didn't 
want to be around for more losing and that the Clippers needed to get serious. 
</P>
<P>
 They did. They traded him two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers sent him to the Pacers last June, along with the rights to Greg 
Minor, in exchange for Pooh Richardson, Malik Sealy and the rights to Eric 
Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Jackson is in a three-way tie with Dominique Wilkins and Ron Harper 
for the honor of newest, most prominent member of the Ex-Clipper Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his stature, Jackson came to play against his former teammates on his 
former home court in his former home of two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome home, Mark? 
</P>
<P>
 "This ain't my home," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glad to see your friends, guys you used to play with? 
</P>
<P>
 "They ain't my friends," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes for Mark Jackson, an ex-Clipper who does not look fondly upon 
his two seasons at point guard, mainly because his point is that he didn't like 
the majority of people on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got some friends on this basketball team," Jackson said of the Pacers. 
"It's not hard to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing with guys in the (1992-93) playoffs against the Houston Rockets 
and after Game 3, they're shipping their cars back home and packing their 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had no commitment to winning. It was a sad event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Management is certainly a big part of why things are so bad, but I don't even 
look at that. We just never had 12 guys committed to winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said only three players on last season's Clipper team played to win, 
himself and two more he would not identify. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not even five players, that's sad," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper management provided the players with charter flights, comfortable 
hotels, plenty of food and financial rewards, but Jackson said the players came 
up short in their end of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 For Clipper bashers, Jackson presents a new target. It wasn't all management's 
fault, it was the players' fault too. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had a few guys busting their tails to win and four or five guys on the 
bench laughing, hoping someone would eat you alive," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're still doing it. It's no secret. Hey, that's no way to be. Guys had no 
respect for each other. Last year the second unit told the first unit they 
could beat us in a seven-game series and they could win in the Western 
Conference playoffs if they were a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they were saying this to Dominique Wilkins, a future Hall of Famer; Ron 
Harper, one of the top guards in the league; and me, and I think I've 
accomplished a few things in this league. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of respect people had for one another and their job, well, you 
don't win no championships when the most important thing is to play Ping-Pong 
in the locker room." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's problems with his peers were sort of lost in the Clipper shuffle 
last season, mainly because there already was a crowded agenda of Clipper 
catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal among them was the Danny Manning saga. Faced with the prospect of 
losing him for nothing, the Clippers sent free-agent-to-be Manning to the 
Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins, a soon-to-be free-agent who wanted $21 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers offered $10 million for three years. Wilkins coughed and 
eventually signed with the Boston Celtics for $11 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, another free agent, wanted $20 million for five years, but the 
Clippers figured he'd never get it. He didn't. He got $19.4 million for five 
years from the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 If you mix in the usual trauma associated with the insecurity of being a 
Clipper coach -- which Bob Weiss felt, with good reason -- it's easy to see how 
Jackson's complaints might have fallen on deaf ears. There was already too much 
yelling going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fitch, who inherited Weiss' job, said he understands Jackson's plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he really felt that way about the guys he was playing with, it's probably 
good for him that he's gone," Fitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, we're happy with what we have. It would have been a factor of his 
numbers, his age, things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's numbers were down slightly from the previous two seasons. His 
scoring average dipped from 14.4 to 10.0 and his shooting percentage fell, but 
his assist average of 8.6 was eighth in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 As for age, Jackson and Richardson are both 28. They were born on the same day 
in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brown, who coached Jackson with the Clippers in 1992-93 and now has him 
in Indiana, said Jackson and others have painted an unflattering picture of 
last season in Clipperland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys were more interested with what was going to happen to them than with the 
team," he said. "I heard that all last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When your best player comes in and gives you a list of 10 demands like new 
uniforms, a new arena, new music, then you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was referring to Manning, who had an extensive want-list when he was 
negotiating a contract extension in the summer of 1993, one that was never 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Since owner Donald Sterling had enough problems, General Manager Elgin Baylor 
wasn't with the team every day and Weiss was too busy trying to stay on the 
job, who should have taken care of the player problems, assuming Jackson was 
right? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always said you have to have basketball people making basketball 
decisions," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, one former Clipper basketball person is making basketball 
decisions in an Indiana Pacer uniform. Jackson has no friends, only business 
acquaintances, among the Clippers and may have sent the Clipper Blame Squad off 
running in a new direction. The locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, won by Indiana, Jackson put the Pacers and Clippers in their 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good teams finish off teams like that," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants you to know which one he plays for now.

CONTEST THAT WAS A TURNING POINT FOR THE SEASONS OF BOTH TEAMS. 
</P>

<P>
 It was the defining moment of the season for two teams headed in opposite 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders supposedly had a Super Bowl in their future. The San Diego 
Chargers supposedly had no future. Not in 1994. Not according to the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers had won their first three games. But all of their opponents -- 
the Denver Broncos, Cincinnati Bengals and Seattle Seahawks -- were suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had lost two of their first three. But quarterback Jeff Hostetler 
had played as if he had a sore arm, incapable of throwing an effective spiral 
although he said he was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth week of the season, with Hostetler again appearing sound, the 
Raiders and Chargers met at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 With 7:01 to play, it appeared the Raiders had won that test as cornerback 
Lionel Washington stepped into the end zone to complete a 31-yard return after 
an interception to give the Raiders a 24-23 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the field, San Diego quarterback Stan Humphries lay 
writhing on the ground, clutching his left knee after getting hit on the play. 
A team doctor told Humphries he was finished for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Not by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries limped back onto the field in the closing minutes and drove his club 
to victory, John Carney kicking a 33-yard field goal with two seconds to play 
for a 26-24 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers went on to win their first six games and now sit atop the AFC 
West at 9-3. The Raiders, their defense repeatedly showing an alarming softness 
in the fourth quarter, have continued to struggle, splitting their first 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was crucial for us not to let something go we worked so hard that 
game for," said Humphries in looking back at that September meeting. "It was 
good for this football team to see that there's never any quit in us." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight comes another test, this one at San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium, where 
the Raiders and Chargers meet again. 
</P>
<P>
 The goals this time, however, are considerably different. San Diego is trying 
to clinch the division title. The Raiders are merely trying to stay alive. A 
loss would drastically dim their hopes of qualifying for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 To win, the Raiders are going to have to shut down the Charger offense. To 
most teams, that would mean bottling up running back Natrone Means. San Diego 
is third in the AFC in rushing, led by Means, who began the weekend leading the 
conference in rushing with 1,101 yards. That total puts him third in the league 
behind Detroit's Barry Sanders and Dallas' Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 But Means is not the Raiders' biggest worry. Run-stuffing is their specialty. 
With 300-pounders Chester McGlockton and Jerry Ball in the middle of their 
defensive line, the Raiders are fourth in the AFC in run defense. 
</P>
<P>
 No, their biggest concern might be Ronnie Harmon, who is described by Charger 
Coach Bobby Ross as "one of the better third-down backs in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 He'll get no argument from the Raiders, who sometimes don't seem to have a 
clue how to stop Harmon. Time and again, he has slid out of the San Diego 
backfield to catch crucial passes. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened on the final drive of that September game, Harmon catching an 
eight-yard pass from Humphries on a fourth-down play to keep San Diego moving. 
Harmon caught a game-high six passes for 74 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last five games against the Raiders over three seasons, Harmon has 
caught 20 passes for 295 yards. That averages out to four catches for 59 yards 
per game from a running back. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, Harmon doesn't just pick on the Raiders. He is San Diego's leading 
receiver with 42 catches for 435 yards and caught his first touchdown pass last 
week against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider offense must overcome a few problems if it is to be effective. 
Hostetler is expected to play, but he will be trying to shake off any lingering 
effects of a concussion that knocked him out of last week's loss to the 
Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are trying to strike a balance in their passing game between 
getting the ball to leading receiver Tim Brown too much, which drew criticism 
from those who labeled their aerial attack too one-dimensional, and not getting 
the ball to Brown enough, which drew criticism from the receiver last week. 
After catching only three passes in a 21-3 loss, Brown blasted the game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 As if all this weren't enough to worry about, there is also Junior Seau. The 
Chargers are now moving their star linebacker around more, giving him more 
opportunities to get into the opposing backfield. Seau, who was bothered by a 
pinched nerve in his neck last week, has 5 1/2 sacks, 1 1/2 short of his career 
high.

MIKE DOWNEY: EVERYONE LOVES A LOSER, GIVE THEM A COMMUNITY HUG

<P>
 The time has come to get behind Your Los Angeles Clippers. Come to a game. 
Come one, come all. Be there for tonight's loss to Charlotte. Get your tickets 
while they're cold. My friends, you can see ordinary basketball any time, any 
place, any nexus. But a team like this comes along only once in a lifetime. 
Come, feel the magic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are a dream come true. No, make that a nightmare come true. 
You've heard of the Dream Team? Say hello to the Nightmare Team. You think Tom 
Cruise and Brad Pitt are scary? Ha! Interview these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 I wore my Clipper cap to a college basketball game. "Why?" everyone there 
asked. I replied: "You say, 'Why?' But I say, 'Why not?' " Because you gotta 
believe! The Clippers can do it! They are 0-15! They can go 0-82! Which has 
never been done! I promise never to remove my Clipper cap until the Clippers 
win a game! Sworn this day, Dec. 5, 1994. Man, is my scalp going to smell by 
February or what? 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers just lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves. At home. This was the 
NBA equivalent of Beavis beating Butt-head. I believe the public-address 
announcer said: "Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Your Los Angeles Clippers! 
The names have been changed to protect the innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 The Five Stooges ran right out and lost again. Poor saps. I feel so sorry for 
these mugs. They should wear hoods. Maybe masks. Maybe unlisted numbers. And 
their poor fans. I hear Clipper season ticket-holders are applying for the 
federal NBA Witness Protection Program. And I don't mean just some of their 
season ticket holders. I mean both of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal. Charles Barkley. Scottie Pippen. These are only a few of the 
basketball players who could defeat the Clippers single-handedly. Patrick Ewing 
and any four thugs from New York could defeat the Clippers. Come to think of 
it, the Knicks are Patrick Ewing and any four thugs from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on. Get your lazy butt out of your chair and come to tonight's Clipper 
basketball defeat. Our Clippers need our help. Wear your Clipper cap, the way I 
will. Buy more Clipper merchandise. Trust me, it will be very valuable some 
day, like Edsel automobiles and Jeffrey Dahmer autographs. Clipper souvenirs 
will be worth so much, Bruce McNall will use them for collateral. This team 
could make a fortune selling brown paper bags with eye slits. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget: You could be there the night they win! What a night that 
will be. The crying, the shouting! Not by the Clippers. By whichever team they 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Go to a game. Now, before it's too late. I mean, who wants to cheer for a 1-15 
team? An 0-15 team is special. An 0-25 team would be extra-special. An 0-35 
team could be super-special. An 0-81 team would be the hottest ticket in NBA 
history. An 0-82 team could mean books, songs, made-for-TV movies. Think of it. 
The losin'est team ever! Memories are made of this. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I say: Get out there. Cheering for the Clippers in an NBA game is 
like cheering for Lithuania in the Olympics. It's that special feeling you get 
from supporting the needy. It's that holiday spirit that makes you fall to your 
knees and be thankful that no matter how much you suffer, at least you're not a 
Clipper. It makes children sit on Santa's lap and say, "Please, give me toys, 
dolls, underwear, anything but Clipper stuff." Even the naughty ones. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe we should back our team. I believe if we all get out there and 
really, really, really pull for our guys, we can lose every game. I know, it 
would take a miracle. But this is the season of miracles. We can lose every 
game with Sacramento. You think we can't? Can and will! Dallas doesn't scare us 
one bit. The Mavericks never saw the day they couldn't beat us. New Jersey? 
Man, you think we can't lose to New Jersey? You bet we can! Can and have! 
</P>
<P>
 Look, we've already had Showtime. Been there, done it, seen it. But this, this 
is different. This is NoTime. This is a team for the ages -- either Dark or 
Stone, I haven't decided. Bring your NoTime banners. Wave your NoTime placards. 
I might even copyright NoTime, pull a Pat Riley. You have to think ahead in 
this business. After all, the Clippers are going for a NoPeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, say, the Charlotte Hornets as they dress for tonight's game. What 
must they be thinking? Maybe Larry Johnson suggests that everyone on his team 
wear a dress. Maybe Alonzo Mourning suggests that everyone plays without shoes. 
You know, in their stocking feet. Make things a little more even. Give the 
Clippers a chance. Maybe Muggsy Bogues will start at center. He's what, 5 feet 
4? For the Clippers, he could start at center. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe, just maybe, the opponents will sink to their knees. To pray: "Dear 
Lord, don't let it be us." Pray to not lose to the Clippers. Pray to not be the 
first. Because they would never, ever be able to go home to North Carolina 
again. To face their loved ones. To enter a restaurant. Parents would say: 
"Don't look, son. He's a Hornet. He lost to the Clippers." Little kids would go 
up to Alonzo and say, "Say it ain't so, Zo! Say it ain't so!" 
</P>
<P>
 Scary thought. But it could happen. Could happen tonight. Could happen this 
week, this month, this season, somewhere in America, at a gymnasium near you. 
Better not miss it. Better be there. Bring your Clipper cap. Teams like this 
don't come along every day. Just lose, baby.

NCAA SOCCER; INDIANA PAYS BACK TITANS IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY GRAHAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton fell just short of a second consecutive trip to the final 
four as Indiana prevailed, 2-1, Sunday in front of 2,716 at Bill Armstrong 
Stadium in the NCAA men's soccer quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, who finished the season 14-7-2 after overcoming a series of 
injuries and other maladies, nearly surmounted a 2-0 second-half deficit. 
Freshman midfielder Martin Palos, who scored the Titans' only goal at 67:07 off 
a Brad Wilson cross, had earlier fired a shot that caromed hard off the right 
goal post. Earlier, Indiana scored in the 52nd minute when Jeff Bannister's 
cross deflected off Titan defender Peter Lak into the net to take a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers (22-2) never felt their lead was safe against the Titans, who 
were responsible for one of their losses this season, a 3-2 overtime defeat in 
the UCLA Classic on Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told their coach and their team that they were the strongest opponent 
we faced all year -- I can't even say how many ranked teams we played (11)," 
Indiana Coach Jerry Yeagley said. "They have a lot of very talented players, in 
terms of technical ability, and also do a lot of great combination work." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Coach Al Mistri had similar sentiments about the Hoosiers. Before the 
match, Mistri said, "They're the best team we met all year, by far, and 
possibly the best team in recent memory in terms of being complete -- with 
talent from goalie to striking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The youngsters will take it hard, but I'm a little older and can look at it 
as the end of an excellent season."  
</P>
<P>
 The Titans were facing more than just the Indiana players on the field in 
terms of intangibles too. The Hoosiers entered the match as the tournament's 
top-seed team, with an all-time NCAA home-field record of 32-2. They also were 
seeking their 10th final four in 19 NCAA appearances over the last 22 seasons 
under Yeagley. 
</P>
<P>
 And, after a first half that was about as entertaining as scoreless soccer can 
be, the odds against a Titan upset lengthened considerably as the Hoosiers 
tallied twice in relatively short order after the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bannister's goal at 51:08, Indiana scored again at 63:37. All-American 
midfielder Brian Maisonneuve sent a nifty slip-head toward the goal off a feed 
from Mike Clark. Indiana forward Craig Ginsberg beat a defender to chase down 
Maisonneuve's pass on the right wing. Ginsberg drew Titan goalkeeper Justin 
Johnson to the near post, saw Indiana freshman Caleb Porter make a run into the 
box, and fed Porter for the point-blank score. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton nearly retaliated immediately as junior striker Matt Bradbury broke 
loose up the gut to get a one-on-one chance against Indiana goalkeeper Scott 
Coufal. But Coufal came off his line aggressively to smother the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans cut the deficit in half when Wilson hustled to save a ball that 
appeared headed over the end line and fed Palos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brad looked up and saw me, but the ball went off a defender's foot and I was 
really just in the right place at the right time," Palos said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first goal allowed in the tournament by Indiana's nation-leading 
defense, which held firm for the duration of the match. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans played Indiana even-up, which is reflected in the final statistics. 
The Hoosiers had one more shot (13-12), the Titans one more corner kick (7-6), 
and each keeper made five saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana will play UCLA, a 3-2 winner over the College of Charleston, in next 
week's semifinals at Davidson, N.C.

VOLLEYBALL; CSUN WOMEN BLOCK PATH OF SAN JOSE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense wins championships. 
</P>
<P>
 That axiom is frequently used when talking about football, but it also applies 
to volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the Cal State Northridge women's team, which defeated San Jose State, 
15-4, 15-13, 13-15, 15-6, to win the National Invitational volleyball 
championship at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (23-8) had 16 total team blocks to San Jose State's eight, and 
out-dug the Spartans, 61-44, to win their 11th match in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge clinched the title on a block by Ana Kristich. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were a powerful team," Kristich said. "The key was not to get 
down and keep siding out. We were ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge trailed, 3-2, in the first game before scoring the next 11 points 
for a 13-3 advantage. The Matadors didn't trail in the second game, but blew a 
12-9 lead in the third before winning the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (San Jose State) played well in the third game," Kristich said. "We 
didn't let up. We just picked it up another notch in the fourth game." 
</P>
<P>
 The title was Northridge's first in postseason play since the Matadors 
defeated Central Missouri State for the 1987 NCAA Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimee Stone had a match-high 19 kills for Northridge and Missy Clements (.455 
hitting percentage) and Heather Anderson added 16 each. But it was the blocking 
of the 6-foot-2 Anderson and the 6-1 Kristich that shone brightest. 
</P>
<P>
 Each had nine blocks and freshman Rene Goth added six. 
</P>
<P>
 Setter Kathleen Shannon had 44 assists, three service aces and three blocks 
for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Paolo Paz-Soldan led San Jose State (23-12) with 18 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors swept Iowa State, 16-14, 15-6, 15-4, in a semifinal match Sunday 
morning, and Jose State defeated San Diego, 15-10, 19-17, 7-15, 12-15, 15-9.

RAM NOTEBOOK; CONCUSSION PROBLEMS CONTINUING FOR MILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY and CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller, who missed two games after suffering a concussion in 
an Oct. 23 game at New Orleans, gave no evaluation of his status after 
suffering another concussion Sunday in the Rams' 31-15 loss to the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller complained only of a headache after the game, but offered no guarantees 
on his status for this week's game at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure right now," Miller said of his status. "I'm not going to make 
any determination on it. I don't know what the trainers want to do with me. I'm 
still pretty coherent." 
</P>
<P>
 Saint defensive end Wayne Martin beat Ram rookie tackle Wayne Gandy and sacked 
Miller for a seven-yard loss with 4 minutes 45 seconds left to play. Miller had 
to be helped off the field after hitting his head on the grass.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got dinged," he said. "My head slammed into the turf pretty good and it's 
not as bad as the last one. It's just sore." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller suffered post concussion syndrome after hitting his head on the 
artificial turf after a hit by Ernest Dixon in the Rams' 37-34 loss to New 
Orleans in October. Miller complained of dizziness and headaches, and had 
trouble focusing for three weeks after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 2-7 as the Rams' starter this season, returned to the starting lineup 
three weeks ago at San Francisco. On Sunday, he completed 17 of 24 passes for 
198 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did get the ball knocked away by Saint linebacker Darion Connor in the 
second quarter that led to the Saints' fourth touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Chandler, coming off an ankle injury, replaced Miller and completed nine 
of 13 passes for 86 yards. But Chandler failed to get the Rams into the end 
zone on second and goal from the one with 1:39 left. Tailback Jerome Bettis 
lost a yard on second down, Chandler spiked it to stop the clock on third down 
and he was stopped short on a quarterback draw on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Ram injuries: rookie defensive tackle D'Marco Farr (dislocated left 
elbow), cornerback Darryl Henley (left hip) and right guard Leo Goeas (sprained 
ankle). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saint defensive back Othello Henderson came up with two big plays Sunday. He 
recovered Todd Kinchen's fumble on a punt. Then, he recovered running back 
David Lang's fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 The first turnover was expected, according to Henderson. He and his teammates 
had seen Kinchen on film. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he would cough up the ball at least once," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second fumble came as more of a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was coming in to make the tackle and the ball came at me," Henderson said. 
"Everything happened so quick. The ball hit me in the chest and I just held 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Both turnovers led to Saint touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Mario Bates has become comfortable and effective as the Saints' 
primary ball carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates, taken in the second round, gained 96 yards and scored three touchdowns 
Sunday, doubling his season total. It was his second biggest game of the 
season, which was interrupted when teammate Lorenzo Neal broke his jaw outside 
a nightclub, causing him to miss five games in the middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little rusty. I mean I was a lot rusty," Bates said. "I wasn't 
comfortable until a few weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints were more comfortable after that. Bates gained 141 yards and scored 
two touchdowns in his first start, a 33-32 victory over Atlanta on Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates continued to run strong Sunday. He scored on runs of 26, 11 and one 
yard, all in the first half. It gave the Saints a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bates' emergence has made Derek Brown an afterthought. Brown, rushed for 346 
yards as the Saints starting back, has seen limited duty since Bates took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a Servite High graduate, had 30 yards in seven carries against the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I have limited playing time and I don't like it," Brown said. "I 
know I'm a good player. I know I'm a good athlete. My day will come, if not 
here, then somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's contract runs through next season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add quarterbacks: The only Ram player to sack Saint quarterback Jim Everett 
was defensive end Fred Stokes, one of Everett's best friends during his days in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett struggled with the Rams last season and was eventually benched in 
favor of T.J. Rubley. Has Stokes noticed a difference in Everett since the Rams 
traded him to the Saints? 
</P>
<P>
 "His confidence level has gone way up," said Stokes, who was among the first 
of a handful of Rams to congratulate Everett after the game. "I was surprised. 
When he scrambled on fourth down and he threw low outside (to Michael Haynes 
for a first down) I said, 'Whoa.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a new Jim Everett, he's still the same person. But his mind-set is 
different, he has the mind-set he can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett completed 13 of 22 passes for 161 yards and a touchdown Sunday, 
beating his former team for the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crowd count: The crowd of 34,960 was the fourth-smallest to watch a Ram game 
at Anaheim Stadium, but it did outdraw the crowd of 30,065 that came to the 
stadium Friday night for the Mater Dei-Los Alamitos Division I high school 
semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In case you missed it: The Rams got the fans fired up before the game by 
showing highlights of their 31-17 loss at San Diego on their big-screen 
television in the north end zone.

COMMENTARY; WHETHER RAMS STAY OR GO, IT IS TIME FOR KNOX TO LEAVE

 "Is time running out? Yes. We've been here for two years and we've built this 
football team in Chuck's image. The expectancy is there. The performance must 
be there and we have got to be held accountable for what we do."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach, September 1994 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me three years and I'll give you the playoffs." That was the Chuck Knox 
guarantee that floored them, time after time, in job interviews around the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 After two decades, the resume was unassailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired by Rams in 1973, won NFC West title in 1973.  
</P>
<P>
 Hired by Buffalo in 1978, won AFC East title in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired by Seattle in 1983, won AFC wild card in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, how will the last line read? 
</P>
<P>
 How about: Hired by Rams in 1992, fired by Rams in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The handwriting is no longer on the wall; it's everywhere one chooses to look. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Anaheim Stadium scoreboard Sunday: Saints 31, Rams 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In the NFC West standings: Rams are in last place at 4-9, 0-6 against division 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ram record book, filed under "Lowest Winning Percentage by a Ram Head 
Coach": 05,06,16,09,09,06 Pos. Coach Years W-L-T Pct. 1. Hugh Bezdek 1937-38 
1-13-0 .071 2. Bob Waterfield 1960-62 9-24-1 .265 3. Harland Svare 1962-65 
14-31-3 .323 4. Chuck Knox 1992-94 15-30-0 .333 Footnotes to history: Bezdek 
didn't make it through the first month of the 1938 season, Waterfield resigned 
after the eighth game of the 1962 season, and Svare was fired immediately after 
the 1965 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Knox headed for a similar fate? 
</P>
<P>
 Are the Rams headed for St. Louis? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed it hasn't gotten done," Knox said Sunday during the 
post-mortem of a dreadful five-fumble, six-turnover performance. "And I'm the 
head guy, so I should be held accountable. I have to take responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Vitt, the staunchest soldier in Knox's tight coterie of loyal assistants, 
stood outside the Ram coaches cubicle, back pressed against a wall, and said, 
"You either do it or you don't do it. You can't . . . . everybody: 'Well, the 
turnovers did it,' or 'We had injuries.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You either accept the challenge and do it, or you find another line of work." 
</P>
<P>
 That the job hasn't gotten done is so painfully obvious, it hurts merely to 
watch. Since taking over a 3-13 can of Alpo from John Robinson in early 1992, 
Knox has added Sean Gilbert, Jerome Bettis, Shane Conlan, Fred Stokes, Jimmie 
Jones, Joe Kelly, Marquez Pope, Troy Drayton and Chris Miller to the talent 
base and watched the Rams' performance actually regress. 
</P>
<P>
 After 13 games in 1992, the Rams were 5-8. At the same stage in 1993, they 
were 4-9. Now, again, they are 4-9, only winless against the NFC West for the 
first time under Knox and quite possibly bound for 4-12, which would represent 
another first for Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox declined to answer queries about his job security because "that's 
speculation, and I'm only concerned with what I can control and that's 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he added, "It's not over yet. We have three games left. I'd like to 
win each and every one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Three games -- at Tampa Bay (2-0 in its last two, a feat unmatched by the Rams 
of Knox II), at Chicago (less talent than the Rams but tied for the lead in the 
NFC Central) and against Washington on Christmas Eve, with "Dear John, we're 
going to St. Louis" notes left in the stocking of each remaining Ram fan. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is still open, but that's about it. Everyone knows how this story is 
going to end, and it doesn't look good for the steely-eyed Irishman. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrast the reputation with the reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Reputation: Knox wins division championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: Since returning to the Rams in 1992, Knox is 2-16 against NFC West 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Reputation: Knox rebuilds defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: The Rams have yielded 31 points in each of their last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Reputation: "Ground Chuck." 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: Jerome Bettis has rushed for three touchdowns this season. New 
Orleans' Mario Bates, making his fourth career NFL start, matched that Sunday 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Reputation: Knox teams don't quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: This Knox team had quit written all over it Sunday, all the way down 
to the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 28-7, in the waning seconds of the first half, Knox had quarterback 
Chris Miller take a knee and run out the clock amid a cacophony of boos. Same 
score, third quarter, Rams have the ball on their own 42 -- fourth and one -- 
and Knox sends in the punt team. 
</P>
<P>
 By afternoon's end, surrender had become so embedded in the Ram game plan that 
reserve quarterback Chris Chandler was moved to bizarrely spike the ball on 
third and goal from the New Orleans two-yard line with 1:15 left. The clock was 
running, and the Rams owned no more timeouts, but they had two throws into the 
end zone if Chandler hurried to the line and called an audible. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the ball is spiked, bringing on fourth down, and Chandler, bizarrely 
again, tries a quarterback sneak that is buried at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram fans can only hope the drivers of the moving vans take the same tack when 
they arrive at Rams Park this winter. If they do, the vans will never get out 
of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing you can't do after a loss is make excuses," Vitt said. "You 
can't line up the alibis. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Knox) wants to be held accountable, that's fine by me. Count me in too. 
I'm on his bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
 So it's a convoy, then. Moving vans, Chuck Knox bandwagon, all of them headed 
in the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of town.

RAMS CAN'T SEEM TO GET HANDLE ON SUCCESS AGAINST SAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was there for the taking, and Rams defensive end Robert Young knew it. He 
just couldn't reach out and grab it. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation: Scoreless game, New Orleans pinned at its one-yard line and 
Young is chasing Saints quarterback Jim Everett in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect-case scenario: Young buries Everett for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst-case scenario: Everett completes an 11-yard pass to Wesley Walls for a 
first down, keeping alive a 99-yard touchdown drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday turned out to be a day of worst-case scenarios for the Ram defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Young missed the sack, Everett got the completion and his second victory this 
season over his former teammates as the Saints rolled to a 31-15 victory at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was coming and we just couldn't stop it," Young said. "We knew Jim 
was coming with the bootleg there. He just got the ball off." 
</P>
<P>
 While Everett and the Saints celebrated, the Rams were left alone in the NFC 
West cellar with a 4-9 record, guaranteeing them a fifth consecutive losing 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds me of last year," linebacker Shane Conlan said. "You can come up 
with a lot of excuses, but we didn't play well. That's the bottom line. We've 
got three games left, and we're not going to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 But have they already? The Ram defense, considered the team's strength in 
September, has given up 31 points in each of the past three weeks -- a 31-27 
loss at San Francisco, a 31-17 loss at San Diego last week and Sunday's 
16-point loss to the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave up 137 yards rushing to a Saint offense that's last in the 
league in that department. Mario Bates, the Saints' tailback making his fourth 
career start, rushed for 96 yards and three first-half touchdowns, one shy of 
the season scoring total for Ram tailback Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett was sacked only once -- a nine-yard loss by Fred Stokes -- and the 
Rams spotted the Saints a 14-point lead, as they did in a 37-34 loss at New 
Orleans on Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even like Jim Everett," said strong safety Marquez Pope, who was 
traded from San Diego to the Rams after the club sent Everett to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know him and I don't care to. And that's not in a bad way. He's 
probably happy that he got his two victories." 
</P>
<P>
 Credit the Rams' offense and special teams for setting up Everett and the 
Saints' offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints held a 28-7 halftime lead, but their average time of possession on 
the four touchdowns was only 1 minute 53 seconds. The Saints can thank Todd 
Kinchen, who fumbled away two punt returns, tailback David Lang (one fumble) 
and quarterback Chris Miller (one fumble) for giving them decent field position 
all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got our butts kicked today -- offense, defense and special teams," Ram 
safety Anthony Newman said. "Everything went the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially on the Saints' 99-yard touchdown drive. Everett picked apart the 
Ram defense, throwing under the coverage and completing four of five passes for 
49 yards. Bates finished them off with a 26-yard run around the right side. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was pathetic," Newman said of the drive. "That's terrible. That's the 
worst we've ever played as a defense. It was just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier last week, Young said the key to the game would be the defense's 
ability to rattle Everett, who has a reputation for being jittery in the 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, the team leader with 6 1/2 sacks, didn't produce a sack Sunday. But he 
did knock Everett out of the game briefly with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was my worst game," Young said. "I wasn't making plays, missing tackles 
and I had a chance at the sack, and I missed it. That's a terrible game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams played without starting defensive tackle Jimmie Jones, who's out 
because of an ankle injury. His replacement, rookie D'Marco Farr, went out with 
a dislocated left elbow in the first quarter. That left backup tackle David 
Rocker, and, at times, defensive end Gerald Robinson to replace Farr. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out flat," Young said. "You just can't do that, and we've been doing 
that the past few weeks."

EVERETT LEAVES TOWN A WINNER THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Everett knew there could be days like this. Other quarterbacks had 
experienced them. 
</P>
<P>
 He was standing at the south end of Anaheim Stadium, a victory behind him and 
fans cheering in front of him. Everett had seen the scene often in eight years 
with the Rams. Now it was his turn. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just helped New Orleans to a 31-15 victory over his former teammates. 
The approval of Saint fans washed over him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was great coming off the field," Everett said. "There has always been a 
lot of fans from the other teams come out here. I often wondered what it would 
be like to be the opposing quarterback in this stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 There were many a Ram fan who wanted him to have that experience. Those nifty 
strolls by opposing quarterbacks were many times caused by Everett's 
performance as Ram quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram fans knew that, and they were not about to forgive or forget. They came to 
bury Everett, not praise him. 
</P>
<P>
 He was booed and heckled from the start. The fans cheered when he ducked for 
cover on one pass play. They jeered when his pass was intercepted. They were 
downright delirious when he briefly left the game because of a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was the extent of Ram fan happiness. Everett's joy lasted longer. He 
won and got to take that victory walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it's like now to be in a city whose fans are very supportive," 
Everett said. He came back to notch his second victory over his former team. 
Everett had thrown for 206 yards and a touchdown in a 37-34 victory in October 
at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 But this one was different. It was in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very focused all week," Everett said. "My teammates had to come to me 
to ease my excitement. They said, 'We're going to win this as a team. Just do 
your part.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Everett led the Saints on a 99-yard scoring drive on their first possession. 
He closed the first half by throwing a touchdown pass to Michael Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
 He left for good because of a foot injury in the fourth quarter. By then, he 
had completed 13 of 22 passes for 161 yards and one touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jim's been hyped up all week," Haynes said. "You always want to beat the team 
you left. You want to see your old teammates do well, but you still want that 
organization to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 If that was the case, Everett hid it well.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams traded him for a seventh-round draft pick. But Everett isn't bitter, 
or so he claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really live for vindication," he said. "There's no pay backs. Life 
has gone on. Life has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe in some places, but not in the stands Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram fans were ready for a quick collapse when he ran onto the field with the 
Saints a mere six inches from their goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 But on second down, Everett rolled right in the end zone and threw to tight 
end Wesley Walls, who made a diving catch for the first down. Everett turned to 
the stands and pointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were getting on us pretty good, but it was good to see them fired up 
around here," Everett said diplomatically. "I really didn't hear anything they 
were saying."  
</P>
<P>
 Everett completed his first four passes for 49 yards on the drive, which ended 
with a 26-yard touchdown run by Mario Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 "That 99 1/2-yard drive set the tone," Everett said. "It was nice to get that 
done in a stadium in which I have so many good memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram fan memories were revived on the Saints' second possession. Everett hit 
the ground just in front of the rush on third and 18. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Saints got the ball back on a fumble by punt returner Todd Kinchen and 
Everett didn't waste the opportunity. He hit Haynes for a 34-yard gain to the 
Ram 11. Bates scored on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett didn't waver under pressure the rest of the day. Late in the half, 
Everett, with Sean Gilbert in his face, hit Haynes for a 30-yard touchdown pass 
to give the Saints a 28-7 lead with 19 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett suffered a foot injury, when Robert Young tackled him from behind in 
the third quarter. Everett hobbled back, but was not effective and did not play 
in the fourth quarter. By then, the Saints led, 31-7, and his job was done. 
</P>
<P>
 He had come back to Anaheim and won. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was different being over in the other locker room," Everett said. "I can't 
describe the feeling I had walking away after that win. I have seen visiting 
quarterbacks have good days here. Now I've gotten to experience that.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: UCLA, USC HITTING THE TRAIL FOR PREP TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Donahue sounded like a man on a mission. Bags packed, ready to rumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's duck huntin' season again," the UCLA coach said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday was the first day that college football coaches could visit 
prospects at home or school, and Donahue was primed for the recruiting chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to college football's second season. Between now and Feb. 1, the first 
day that high school seniors can sign letters of intent (community college 
players can sign beginning Dec. 21), the recruiting process intensifies as 
coaches go during the week to meet players and make evaluations, then return 
home to play host to weekend campus visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a disappointing 5-6 season, Donahue turned serious quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get some guys who are what I call 'difference-makers,' guys who 
can help us win a national championship," he said. "It's the one thing I 
haven't been able to do at UCLA, and that's our goal." 
</P>
<P>
 So how does Donahue define a difference-maker? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm talking about a pass rusher like Jamir Miller and receivers like J.J. 
Stokes and Kevin Jordan," he said. "Big-play guys. We are so obviously a 
different team with guys like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said the Bruins probably will sign between 15 to 20 players. Of that 
group, he hoped "two or three" would be from community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a pass rusher in the worst way," said Donahue, "and we need to get 
more physical. Of course, you always need offensive linemen." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for Donahue is that dominant pass rushers usually are in short 
supply, and competition for them is fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 At USC, which had an outstanding recruiting class last year with wide receiver 
Keyshawn Johnson, running back Leonard Green, defensive lineman Darrell Russell 
and defensive backs Brian Kelly and Mario Bradley, assistant coach Mike Sanford 
said the Trojans need to keep upgrading their talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to have another top-five recruiting class," said Sanford, who 
coaches wide receivers and coordinates USC's recruiting, along with new 
defensive coordinator Keith Burns and offensive line coach Mike Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 Like UCLA, Sanford said USC probably will sign a class of 16 players, 
including two or three from community colleges -- down from the 10 of last 
year. The Trojans have made quarterback, linebacker and wide receiver a 
priority this year, "because we lose a lot of seniors at those positions." 
</P>
<P>
 "The offensive line is always an important position, and I think it's a good 
year in California for offensive linemen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' top offensive line recruits include Mark Manskar (6-7, 245) of 
Canyon Country Canyon, Brett Samperi (6-5, 275) of San Clemente, James Sherman 
(6-4, 250) of Whittier and Kris Farris (6-8, 275) of Santa Margarita. Farris 
took a weekend recruiting trip to USC, along with tight end/linebacker Brody 
Heffner (6-5, 220) of Del Mar Torrey Pines and defensive lineman Eboni Wilson 
(6-3, 250) of Los Angeles Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to find its quarterback of the future in this class, USC is making a 
strong pitch (and is considered the co-leader, along with UCLA) for John Fox 
(6-3, 185) of Corona Centennial. Coach John Robinson visited only one home last 
Thursday night, and it was Fox's. 
</P>
<P>
 Other quarterbacks on USC's short list are Tom Brady (6-4, 200) of San Mateo 
Serra, Quincy Woods (6-1, 180) of Park Forest, Ill., and strong-armed Brock 
Huard (6-5, 215) of Puyallup, Wash., considered by most talent evaluators as 
the top quarterback prospect on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-handed Huard is the brother of Washington quarterback Damon Huard. 
However, he is not considered a lock to follow in his brother's footsteps. The 
Huard family was upset when Damon was benched during Washington's final game of 
the season, against Washington State. And earlier this season, although the 
Huskies were playing at home against Arizona State, the younger Huard traveled 
to Pullman to see Washington State (another school he is considering) play 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford believes that playing in the Cotton Bowl (Jan. 2 against Texas Tech) 
will be a boost to USC's recruiting in Texas. The Trojans have done well in the 
state in recent years, having signed players such as Brian Williams, John 
Herpin, Shawn Walters and Delon Washington. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA received its first football commitment from highly regarded offensive 
tackle Gene Waters (6-7, 295) of Walla Walla (Wash.) Community College. Waters, 
a second-team All-American selection by the Santa Ana-based J.C. Grid-Wire, 
also visited Arizona State.  
</P>
<P>
 The leader of Mater Dei's outstanding offensive line, tackle Matt Motherway 
(6-4, 255), has recruiting trips planned to California (Dec. 16-18), Stanford 
(Jan. 13-15), UCLA (Jan. 20-22) and Colorado (Jan. 27-29). He might also visit 
Oregon. Motherway, whose brother Ryan played football for two years at UCLA 
before a back injury ended his career (he'll graduate next quarter), projects 
as a guard or center in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast running back Jeff Clayton (6-0, 205), an honorable mention 
All-American selection after rushing for 1,067 yards (4.9 yards per carry) and 
11 touchdowns on a 2-8 team with a young offensive line, has a trip scheduled 
to Texas this weekend. His other visits will probably include Oregon, Colorado 
State and Pittsburgh. Michigan also requested film recently on Clayton, who 
played at Trabuco Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 Another running back who put up good numbers this season despite playing for a 
losing team was Santa Ana Valley's Dwayne Cherrington (5-11, 180). Though the 
Falcons finished 3-7, Cherrington rushed for 1,115 yards (6.2 per carry) and 14 
touchdowns. Coaches from Oregon and Colorado State were in his home over the 
weekend. He probably will take trips to those schools, along with Colorado and 
Arizona State. Other schools still recruiting him include USC, Washington and 
Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoop report: An interested observer at Saturday's John R. Wooden Classic at 
The Pond was Inglewood High standout Paul Pierce, a 6-7 guard-forward 
considered the top senior prospect in California. Pierce was there to see two 
of his top five college choices play: Kansas and UCLA. He took his first 
official recruiting trip to Kansas Nov. 25-27, where his host was point guard 
Jacque Vaughn, who played at Pasadena Muir. Pierce is still awaiting results of 
his Scholastic Aptitude Test. Basketball players who have not been cleared by 
the NCAA Clearinghouse are allowed to take paid recruiting trips after the 
one-week November signing period has ended. Pierce watched the Jayhawks beat 
San Diego, and said he was surprised when the student section began chanting 
his name during a timeout. Other finalists for Pierce are Cal, Arizona and 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's considered a very long shot, UCLA is still recruiting the top 
guard in the country, 6-1 Stephon Marbury of Brooklyn. Marbury will probably 
visit UCLA during the basketball season, then sign with either Syracuse (the 
favorite) or Georgia Tech.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; GOLDEN WEST WINS SECOND STATE TITLE IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Becca Foltz earned her second consecutive most valuable player award as Golden 
West won its second consecutive State women's volleyball title with a victory 
over Cerritos on Sunday at DeAnza College in Cupertino. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz, a sophomore outside hitter from Foothill High, had 17 kills in the 
title match as the Rustlers swept, 15-12, 17-15, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa Dahl added 15 kills for Golden West, which has won four of the last 
five State titles under Coach Albert Gasparian. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl and Christine Heims, along with Foltz, were selected to the 
all-tournament team for Golden West (25-2). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers' two losses this season came to Cerritos in a tournament in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos (22-2) lost twice to Golden West, both times in the State tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put it together as a team for a weekend," Gasparian said. "You could tell 
Tuesday against Mt. San Antonio (in a playoff game) that we were starting to 
click." 
</P>
<P>
 In the College of the Sequoias women's basketball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West 75, Fullerton 52 -- Deana Itow and Julie Murdent each scored 19 
points and April Van Sweden added nine to lead Golden West (9-3) to the 
consolation title. Lupe Janos and Vanessa Trujillo each scored 13 points for 
Fullerton (6-4).

LONG BEACH STATE ROUTS MONTANA IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Determined and confident, Montana quickly encountered women's volleyball West 
Coast-style. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending national champion Long Beach State overwhelmed Montana, 15-10, 15-6, 
15-8, Sunday in the second round of the NCAA Northwest Region tournament in 
front of 1,757 at The Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a little bit of a different level of play for them," Long Beach 
Coach Brian Gimmillaro said. "We play a little faster and a little higher than 
they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior outside hitter Brita Schwerm led the 49ers (26-5) with a match-high 17 
kills. Senior middle blocker Traci Dahl had 12 kills and seven total blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichelle Burton -- the 49ers' All-American senior outside hitter and Big West 
Conference player of the year -- also played well despite being slowed by a 
sprained right ankle. She contributed 11 kills and 13 digs. Sophomore Heather 
Hofmans, the starting setter, had 35 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really, really proud of how Heather and Brita added to the match," 
Gimmillaro said. "Nichelle probably shouldn't have played, so it was really 
necessary for us to get some help. We got the help from Brita and Heather, and 
Traci played her normal excellent match." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Montana left impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt about it -- we went against a very good team," said Montana Coach 
Dick Scott, whose Grizzlies finished 25-6. "We have some extremely good 
athletes, but they had a little bit more size on us and like athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big West and (Pacific 10) compete against tough teams all the time. In 
conference, we have teams that we really can walk through and that hurts us 
sometimes. (Long Beach has) to compete hard every match." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, ranked seventh in the nation and seeded second in the region, will 
play host to the regional semifinals and final Friday and Saturday at the Gold 
Mine gym on campus. The four-time defending Big West champion, Long Beach will 
play either Idaho or Hawaii at 8 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this was the best post-season run in the Grizzlies' history. 
</P>
<P>
 Making its third tournament appearance, Montana won Wednesday in the opening 
round at home. It defeated Arkansas State, 14-16, 15-10, 15-9, 17-15. Montana, 
which entered the tournament ranked No. 23, is co-champion of the Big Sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to go against the best to see where you are," said Scott, who 
recently completed his 17th season in Missoula. "We felt very excited about 
getting selected and hosting the first round, winning that and coming to the 
next round against the defending national champions. What could be better?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, winning would be one guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana started quickly, taking a 6-1 lead in the opening game on a kill by 
senior middle blocker Heidi Williams, who had 12 kills. Then the 49ers took 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, Gimmillaro called for a timeout and encouraged his charges to 
start playing in earnest or at least wake up. They listened and scored seven of 
the next nine points to tie the score at 8-8 on Dahl's kill. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to play determined and relaxed, and it's very difficult for young 
people to do both," Gimmillaro said. "Either we're too relaxed or we're hyped. 
But we're working on it. I knew we'd be OK if we continued to concentrate on 
what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana scored only twice more in the first game. A kill by Burton completed 
Long Beach's rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have such high expectations coming into this tournament," Schwerm said. "I 
think anytime you have goals it's understandable to have nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a little overanxious, a little nervous, and I think once we got that 
out of our system we played a little more comfortably."

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: CURING SONY'S ACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sony's recent $2.7-billion write-down of its Hollywood studio has raised the 
issue of whether the Japanese electronics giant and its top U.S. executive, 
Michael P. Schulhof, have been too hands-off in managing Sony's Hollywood 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. A brochure circulating last week among employees at Sony 
Pictures shows that things have become very much hands-on, at least in one 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochure touts "body focus" massage services offered at the Sony Pictures 
Athletic Club in the studio's TriStar Building. Prices range from $30 for a 
half-hour to $120 for a two-hour full-body massage. 
</P>
<P>
 Included is a section on "How to Receive a Massage." Among the tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The best way to receive a massage is with the body completely unclothed. 
Your therapist is sensitive to the need for privacy and will keep your body 
covered except for the area being massaged. If this arrangement is not 
comfortable, you may wear underwear." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Very often, as the body releases tension during a massage, the mind will 
release emotion. If you suddenly feel sad, angry or joyful, do not be alarmed. 
Allow yourself to express these feelings by crying or laughing. At the very 
least, feel free to sigh with relaxation or hum with pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Be limp, like a rag doll, and do not try to help move your arms, legs or 
head. Your therapist is a trained professional who will not do anything to hurt 
you. However, feel free to speak up if anything they do is too painful or 
ticklish or uncomfortable in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Many people fall asleep during a massage, an indication that the body and 
mind are releasing stress and tension. Your therapist will gently wake you when 
it's time to turn over or end the massage." No Money-Back Guarantee 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping channel QVC may be a shoppers' paradise, but the company hasn't had 
much luck so far when it comes to buying into joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 In Securities and Exchange Commission documents, the company says it recorded 
a $350,000 loss backing a media company formed by former Wall Street Journal 
Executive Editor Norman Pearlstine. The firm, Friday Holdings, is being 
dismantled now that Pearlstine is joining Time Warner as editor-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Another loss stemmed from a venture to produce and distribute the Joan Rivers 
program "Can We Shop?" The documents say QVC's share of the operating loss on 
the joint venture with Tribune Entertainment and Regal Communications totaled 
$831,000. Briefly. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tribune, owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, says the baseball strike 
hurt its third-quarter earnings by about $5.3 million. . . . Buy low, sell 
high: Newport Beach investment manager Norman Yu suggests the best market 
strategy is "to sell the losers and keep the winners" . . . . Fun facts: The 
$1.5-billion investment loss suffered by Orange County works out to about $582 
per person in the county. . . . Some 20% of sports executives polled by 
International Sport Summit said figure skating would benefit from the current 
labor strife in professional baseball and hockey.

JACK SMITH: FROM THE RUINS OF LINGERIE AND PERFUME RISES LIBRARY OF LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "It's still boarded up," my wife said gloomily the other night as we passed 
Bullocks Wilshire on the way home from the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 It was true. Shutters darkened the windows that in past seasons would have 
been alive with stylish mannequins or Santa and his reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullocks Wilshire has long been considered the most beautiful commercial 
building in Los Angeles. It has been called a modern cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Art Deco landmark was built in 1929, the neighborhood was in the 
suburbs. The store was built for the automobile, with its opening on the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hailed as a piece of art that would define a generation, designed to 
project an aura of modern luxury, down to its radiator covers and drinking 
fountains. Its famous rose marble interior walls and modern-style murals remain 
intact, as does the granite and copper exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 In the parking lot -- or "motor court" -- uniformed valets helped shoppers out 
of their cars at the porte-cochere under a richly colored ceiling fresco 
depicting a brave new world of transportation: a Zeppelin, an airplane, a 
luxury steam liner and Mercury, the winged god of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The store was acquired by R.H. Macy & Co. in 1988, and was closed shortly 
after Macy's went bankrupt. When it closed its doors on April 13, 1993, a pall 
fell over the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 When my wife and I drove by the boarded-up store, I was reminded of a letter I 
had received a day or two earlier from a Connecticut man who had worked for 
Bullocks Wilshire and for Robinson's in his youth. He had read a magazine 
article I wrote recently about Bullocks Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the shock of my life," wrote Jack Bryant of Cornwall, Conn., "when I 
read in your column that Bullocks Wilshire was boarded up. I worked at 
Robinson's and what we used to call BW when I was a senior at Los Angeles High 
School. A lot of fast kids got their clothes at BW and I thought I'd go for the 
glamour." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant liked Robinson's better than BW because it was more humane in its 
treatment of customers, who were called patrons. But BW had experience with 
bogus buyers and con artists. Some said they (the glamorous) were the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left Robinson's to go to BW it was like I had gone over to the enemy. 
A nice Catholic boy. Why did I go there? All those snooty people. The Fremont 
Place crowd. Christmas trees made of ostrich feathers. Chartreuse and cranberry 
Christmas wrappings. Whores in the lingerie. Face lifts in the tearoom. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the interior of the store remains as it was. As The Times described 
it, "Intricate bronze-colored doors welcome the shopper into a cosmetics hall 
more like a marble basilica than a store, with vertical stripes of lights 
reaching from the pale, rose-colored walls across the ceiling. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 When I was in high school I used to wander with feigned nonchalance through 
that basilica, breathing its exotic perfumes and ogling the pretty counter 
saleswomen. I never bought anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when I became more affluent, I sometimes had lunch in the tearoom, 
sipping white wine and watching the models slink down the steps to parade in 
the latest fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the store was sold to Macy's, it was discovered -- to the 
horror of Los Angeles culture buffs -- that numerous articles and fixtures were 
disappearing and turning up in I. Magnin stores (which are also owned by Macy's 
and now also will all be closed). 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who were disaffected by this rapacious practice was Mayor Richard 
Riordan, who wrote a letter to Macy's asking that it desist. Riordan and Los 
Angeles preservationists strongly urged that missing items -- such as 
chandeliers from lingerie and massive light fixtures from the former saddle 
shop -- be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shocking was the revelation that some of the missing chandeliers were 
found hanging in an I. Magnin store in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's agreed to return some of the missing pieces and to talk about the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 After reminiscing about his days in the store, Bryant wrote: "I now come to 
the point of my letter. What's going to happen to BW's beautiful building?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 The cathedral of commerce is about to become a cathedral of education. The 
39-year lease owned by Macy's has been sold to the Southwestern University 
School of Law, whose academic and business offices are nearby.  
</P>
<P>
 As much as possible, the old building and its treasures will be kept intact. 
The first two floors will be converted into a library for the university's 
340,000 books. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lee H. Taylor, dean of Southwestern, renovation is already under way. 
"One of the most admired and significant structures in the country, the 
Bullocks Wilshire building will, over the next year and a half or so, become 
Southwestern's Law Library. We've only just begun." 
</P>
<P>
 Where young women used to go for lingerie and perfume, they will hereafter be 
able to peruse Sir William Blackstone's commentaries on English law and the 
most significant decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.

 In the news: Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on O.J.'s lead attorney, Robert 
Shapiro, saying the defense would "now take the high road" in its public 
statements: "He then told Johnnie Cochran Jr. to go see if he could find a 
Thomas Bros. Guide. . . . Shapiro later announced that he and Cochran would 
enter a 12-step program for media addicts." 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Argus Hamilton, on conservative Republicans being angered by Sen. Bob 
Dole's willingness to compromise with President Clinton on GATT: "Sometimes 
when you're in the middle of the road, you get hit by cars going both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, on the CNN poll that shows voters think the GOP will do the best job 
on the economy, defense, taxes, crime and welfare reform: "The Democrats won 
out only on the environment. Republicans don't do yardwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Johnny Robish, on the Jeffrey Dahmer killing: "Officials say the suspect 
believed he was Jesus Christ and killed Dahmer because Dahmer believed himself 
the devil. Gee, who would have ever imagined that this would turn into a Bible 
story?" 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling an old joke ("I can't be overdrawn; I still have checks left"), 
reader Ken Bash of Malibu says Mike Huffington has given it a new spin: "I 
can't have lost the election; I still have money left." 
</P>

 Jay Leno, on Newt Gingrich writing a novel: "Actually, this is not his first 
attempt at fiction. That was the Contract With America." 
</P>

<P>
 Science week: Comedy writer Bob Mills, on discovery of a gene controlling 
appetites in mice and humans: "That explains why some guys take a girl out to a 
big, expensive dinner and then act like a rat." 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Kaplan says the gene was easily identified: "It was the only one visible 
without a microscope." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Gary Easley says scientists already know how to predict if an 
unborn baby will grow up to be a lawyer: "But the really hard part is getting 
its mother to admit that she had sex with Satan." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on the study that shows women have more brain cells 
than men: "In a test of intellect, all the women thought analytically and 
reflectively. All the men thought about was sex." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On rumors of a Michael-Lisa Marie split: 
</P>
<P>
 * "There are even more troubling rumors about the Gloved One. Allegations have 
surfaced that he made improper advances on his inner child." (Peyser) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lisa Marie's lawyers told her that if she plans to charge him with 
adultery, she'll have to file the charges in Juvenile Court." (Mills) 
</P>
<P>
 * "The good news is that Brooke Shields will have a date for the Grammy Awards 
after all." (Leno) 
</P>
<P>
 * "The problem is children. She wants them immediately; he likes to buy them 
dinner first." (Ray)

<P>
 I can't wait for your holiday party. You may think I'm coming for the food 
(could you make those little spinach balls again?), but all I'm really 
interested in is beginning my annual snoop-a-thon. 
</P>
<P>
 I leave no stone unturned, so if you are spending hours with a toothbrush 
polishing tile grout, you might want to shift gears. Consider the underbelly of 
your couch, your medicine and bathroom cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, don't act so surprised; inquiring minds want to know and dig to look 
for the real thing. You have no secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 It's because your stuff always looks better to us than our own does; it's the 
consumer equivalent of the Groucho Marx theory: "You never want to be in a club 
that will have you as a member." Likewise, another woman's mediocre grooming 
products are another woman's treasured loot. 
</P>
<P>
 I usually indulge in a hour or so of meaningless party chitchat ("Didn't 
Clinton look ridiculous in that batik shirt?") before I slip into the covert 
world of the nooks and crannies you never dreamed I'd be investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to you, I've already checked out the fabric content of your throw 
pillows. (Really, you should have popped for silk.) I checked to see if your 
sofa was vinyl or leather (don't worry, your Naugahyde secrets are safe with 
me). I even peeked in the fridge after overdosing on Price Club taquitos. I 
ended up stashing the partially frozen one I sampled under your couch. It's 
smushed, resting alongside that empty Pez dispenser and your husband's 
dog-eared Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the bathroom, door locked, I usually start with innocent, seemingly 
helpful gestures. Such as retrieving an extra roll of paper from your cabinet. 
(Nevermind that the one on the spindle is new; I mean, hey, I'm just trying to 
help.) I might laugh at your old hair net, but this is only a warm-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop, your medicine cabinet. I will usually count how many jars of Prozac 
you have, etc. If I'm feeling bold, I might steal a few of your birth control 
pills for my plants (did you know they make the best fertilizer?). I might peek 
inside the top bathroom drawer, particularly if I forgot that perfect shade of 
lipstick. (Don't worry about getting my germs; I travel with my own lip brush.) 
</P>
<P>
 If my indulgent spirit takes over, I will sneak a spritz of Chanel to combat 
any perspiration resulting from the requisite mingling. While I am at it, I may 
try that new Chanel powder you paid a fortune for that is way beyond my means. 
</P>
<P>
 If your party is really boring and you have more than one bathroom in your 
house, I might fish around for some nail polish. So when you're at the store 
stocking up on cashews, I'd appreciate it if you would pick up some of the 
vermilion Borghese tint I like so much. And some of that quick-dry spray; last 
time I came over you were out. Come to think of it, you were kind of low on 
cotton balls too. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think for one minute that this is a sport with only one player. Nosiness 
is a national pastime. One friend of mine who has a Hitchcockian "Psycho" 
phobia cannot use the facilities without peeking behind the shower curtain 
first for any possible Norman Bates incarnations. By the way, you might want to 
wash your shower curtain to get that nasty mildew off, or at least use a little 
Tilex on it. And for those of you who hire baby-sitters, be advised: When I was 
13 years old, I read "The Sensuous Woman" out of a seemingly private drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most adult snoops, however, impose some boundaries when it comes to domestic 
espionage. I would never brush my teeth with your brush, you may be relieved to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, I would never go into a person's dresser drawers or closet. 
Underwear drawers are verboten too, but apparently Woody Allen has other ideas. 
In "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex," Allen included a vignette 
about a male dinner guest who sneaks into the hostess's bedroom to slip into 
her clothing and unmentionables. 
</P>
<P>
 And you thought your underwear needed to be clean only in case of a car 
accident.

FOR TWO BOYS, A TEST OF SPIRIT AND LOYALTY; THE EXAMINATION BY MALCOLM BOSSE ; 
FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX $17, 296 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Believe it or not, there once was a society that valued smart boys as much as 
we value boys who can dunk a basketball or throw touchdown passes. It was 
16th-Century China, under the Ming Dynasty. Boys smart enough to pass 
examinations at the local, provincial and national levels won respect and 
acclaim, tax exemptions, the glances of marriageable girls and offers of top 
government jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich city boys had the edge, of course, as they always do. (Rich girls had 
their feet bound and were condemned to be merely decorative.) But China was 
enough of a meritocracy so that even poor country boys, if they were smart 
enough, had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm Bosse's latest novel makes heroes of two such boys, the Lao brothers. 
Skinny, dreamy Chen is the scholar. Brilliant enough to overcome being the son 
of a drunkard in remote rural Sichuan, he begins the triumphant progress that 
will take him to the Forbidden City in Beijing for the ultimate exam in the 
presence of the emperor. 
</P>
<P>
 Robust, practical Hong, the younger brother, is smart in a different way. He 
is Taoist rather than Confucian at heart: a man of action and instinct rather 
than an intellectual. Hong figures that if he can protect Chen from the dangers 
and temptations that await them as they journey across China, his fortunes will 
rise along with his brother's. 
</P>
<P>
 This was about the time in history when China began to fall behind Europe. 
Bosse shows us some reasons why. Hong meets soldiers who have guns but disdain 
them in favor of "close-contact weapons." Chen meets a gifted inventor whose 
science is still tangled up with alchemy. Political reformers plot to overthrow 
tyrants but can't conceive of changing the system. The grip of the past is too 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
 To pass the exams -- to demonstrate his competence to help rule the country -- 
Chen has to display mastery of a remarkably limited and arcane body of 
knowledge based on the Confucian classics: 
</P>
<P>
 "Each form of essay involved special rules. A rule governed the number of 
words in a paragraph, the number of paragraphs and their length, the type of 
language used -- either highly formal or conversational. A dozen rules 
determined the stages of argument to be developed according to patterns of 
debate a thousand years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chen understood that not only must a young scholar have a splendid memory but 
his handwriting must be elegant in five different styles. . . . His poetry had 
to display competence in the use of three modern and two ancient rhyme schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because science and math were not required . . . Chen hardly learned to 
count." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosse has written 14 books for adults ("The Vast Memory of Love") and for 
young people ("Deep Dream of the Rain Forest"). This novel is probably aimed at 
youth. Its style is straightforward, its form frankly that of an adventure 
story. Bosse uses Western dates and measurements to convey a huge amount of 
information about China that isn't restricted to what his teen-age heroes might 
be expected to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Chen and Hong are heroes who brave all perils and maintain 
their mutual loyalty.They travel thousands of miles on foot and by riverboat, 
through battle, flood and a plague of locusts. Pirates capture them, separate 
the brothers and threaten Hong (who has joined a secret revolutionary society, 
the White Lotus) with the dreaded Death by a Thousand Cuts. Would-be mentors 
and jealous rivals try to distract Chen from his chosen path, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is subject matter here for grown-ups to chew on, as well. Few 
stories have weighed the active life and the contemplative life with such 
evenhanded respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The harrowing sights Chen sees on the journey humanize him, force his abstract 
Confucianism to address the problems of the real world. He learns from Hong 
enough shrewdness to sidestep the snares of the imperial court. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong, destined for a military career, learns from Chen the power of idealism. 
Enough of the rich culture that has sustained China through centuries of 
calamity seeps into his consciousness so that his life will be more than a mere 
struggle to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither brother "wins." Life itself is the examination, Bosse seems to say; 
there is more than one way to pass.

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; CAST CHANGES IN 'ROMEO' PROVIDE AN INTERESTING MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The final weekend performances of "Romeo and Juliet" at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion offered several major casting firsts in the new San Francisco Ballet 
staging. On Friday, Yuri Posokhov danced as a member of the company for the 
first time, playing Romeo opposite the previously reviewed Elizabeth Loscavio.  
</P>
<P>
 Posokhov had been a fine Romeo in the Bolshoi Ballet production at the Shrine 
Auditorium four years ago, and his dancing Friday provided plenty of Bolshoi 
intensity along with the elegance and mastery of expressive detail honed during 
his seasons with the Royal Danish Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 At once deeply thoughtful and surprisingly spontaneous, his Romeo also offered 
refined virtuosity and superb partnering: a memorable debut indeed. In 
contrast, Jeremy Collins provided a generalized wash of feeling and 
audience-courting, in-your-face bravura on Saturday afternoon, when he danced 
Romeo opposite Sabina Allemann's Juliet for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Both had appeared in Helgi Tomasson's version with different partners and, 
beyond the technical mishaps in their Saturday duets, they made a very odd 
couple. Best known locally as an American Ballet Theatre principal, Collins 
couldn't seem to dance in character, but breezed through big jumps and 
intricate turns, while Allemann (formerly with National Ballet of Canada) 
gloried in passages of lyric flow. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he played Romeo as a reckless airhead swooning over the one girl he 
can't have, and she kept emphasizing Juliet's alarm at how dangerous this love 
affair could be. 
</P>
<P>
 The approaches clashed. Her brooding, curiously prosaic interpretation and his 
relentlessly flighty one turned the relationship upside down: The ballet became 
"Romiette and Julio," star-cross'd in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, Allemann's most effective moments of character 
interaction came in her scenes with the Nurse, a loving woman of homespun 
practicality as played by Lola de Avila. Emil de Cou conducted on Friday night 
and Saturday afternoon, leading a forceful, persuasive account of the score on 
each occasion. LEWIS SEGAL

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; JEFFREY GAINES, PAULA COLE: HEARTFELT PRESENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM * Jeffrey Gaines and Paula Cole play tonight at the Roxy, 9009 
Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, at 7:30. $18. (310) 278-9457.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Passion is no ordinary word, to quote Graham Parker. In the Jeffrey 
Gaines/Paula Cole show Friday night at the Coach House, passion was enough to 
raise the level of the young East Coast singer-songwriters' performances far 
above the level of their songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 Headliner Gaines is a 28-year-old Pennsylvanian with two albums to his credit, 
and Cole, 26, is a Massachusetts-based newcomer with one release. Both offer 
material that is intelligent, deeply felt and melodically attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, supported by a backing guitarist and percussionist, was a commanding 
presence who aimed for the grand gesture and pulled it off. Her dark, plaintive 
songs about stunted lives became short dramas that swept the audience away. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines' firm, richly grained, soulful voice was well-suited to songs that 
often addressed the insecurities and fears that can disrupt relationships or 
stop people from pursuing their own free path in life. 
</P>
<P>
 His unflagging commitment and uncommonly personable stage manner through a 
long solo-acoustic set enabled him to put on a more involving show than some 
superior but less impassioned singer-songwriters could have delivered. MIKE 
BOEHM * Jeffrey Gaines and Paula Cole play tonight at the Roxy, 9009 Sunset 
Blvd., West Hollywood, at 7:30. $18. (310) 278-9457.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; COLVIN ENDEARS; MITCHELL HAS CAMEO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Humility isn't necessarily the hallmark of the singer-songwriter. What helps 
make Shawn Colvin -- a pretty good writer and even better singer -- more 
endearing than most is a properly reverential attitude toward her forebears and 
even contemporaries.First and foremost, Colvin, who performed Saturday at the 
Wiltern Theatre, seems to be a fan . 
</P>
<P>
 That's evident enough from her third album, "Cover Girl," which consists 
entirely of other writers' material. Half these songs showed up in the show, 
aided by musician's musicians Stewart Smith on guitar and Larry Klein on bass 
-- including pretty versions of Tom Waits' "Heart of Saturday Night" and Steve 
Earle's "Someday." 
</P>
<P>
 The humility was more evident still when, mid-set, Colvin acknowledged the 
tremor in her voice as she introduced Klein's ex, Joni Mitchell, who emerged 
and did two numbers of her own, even as the adulatory host briefly exited the 
stage. Inviting your heroine to take over your show, then deigning to follow 
that rapturously received spot -- now that's chutzpah. Or perhaps foolishness. 
</P>
<P>
 But Colvin didn't seem unduly foolhardy as she resumed bringing to bear on 
songs a sweet, gliding voice that seems to combine the best qualities of honey 
and air. When, as her traditional encore, she further acknowledged roots by 
turning her own "Polaroids" into a comically endless medley of snippets of 
every pop hit that ever enjoyed a remotely similar groove, she made you want to 
hear every allusion at full length. CHRIS WILLMAN

JAZZ REVIEW; AKIYOSHI AT HOME WITH BIG-BAND SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billy Strayhorn is often credited with saying that Duke Ellington played the 
piano but his real instrument was his band. The same can be said of Toshiko 
Akiyoshi. 
</P>
<P>
 The composer-pianist, whose orchestra played Bovard Auditorium on the USC 
campus Friday, makes her most lasting statements with her pen. 
</P>
<P>
 Though her keyboard work is full of Bud Powell-like character, it's only one 
ingredient in the grand scope of her music. Akiyoshi's most impressive 
achievement, on full view at this performance, is the sweeping, symphonic 
nature of her compositions; pieces that couple the rhythms of jazz with the 
tonal colors of the classical impressionists. 
</P>
<P>
 As an orchestrator, Akiyoshi has no contemporary peer. Here, trumpet fanfares 
gave way to vigorous lines from trombones and rhythm section, followed by a 
translucent blend of bass clarinet, piccolo, soprano saxophone and bass 
trombone. Shifting lines from four flutes and the bass clarinet were touched by 
the quiet fingerprints of muted trumpets. Rousing, full-bore passages from the 
entire orchestra were balanced by Akiyoshi's understated fills from the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's principal soloist, Lew Tabackin, looked deep into the history of 
the tenor saxophone, playing with the robust, slightly raunchy tone of Ben 
Webster on "And Yet Another Tear" in lines that climbed persistently and with 
little break. An aggressive flutist, Tabackin worked up breathy, virile solos 
that spilled phrases one upon another in tenacious succession. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabackin gave Akiyoshi's "Autumn Sea" its Japanese flavor, playing his flute 
in the style of the Japanese wind instrument shakuhachi as drummer Terry Clarke 
added Eastern touches with his mallets. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the orchestra's other soloists came close to matching Tabackin's high 
style and the band's ensemble play was not as polished as heard on the 
orchestra's recent recordings for Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this was a solid performance of Akiyoshi's tonally ambitious charts 
that showed she has few equals among today's decidedly thin crop of big-band 
composers. BILL KOHLHAASE

TV REVIEW; BRONTE'S LOVERS BROOD AGAIN IN 'HEIGHTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a week it has become for adaptations of classic 19th-Century English 
novels. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, cable's TNT airs the U.S. premiere of Emily Bronte's "Wuthering 
Heights," with Ralph Fiennes starring as the primitive, pagan Heathcliff. That 
follows last night's "Hallmark Hall of Fame" production on CBS of Thomas 
Hardy's "The Return of the Native." 
</P>
<P>
 True to the novels, never has the television screen seemed so full of brooding 
heaths and rippling moors. Both movies, British productions shot on craggy, 
forbidding English landscapes, fully exploit the novels' sense of place. The 
difference is that in "Wuthering Heights," the movie mirrors the feeling that 
you're not in the real world at all but between heaven and hell -- which, of 
course, is exactly where those tragic, tortured lovers, Catherine (Juliette 
Binoche) and Heathcliff, abide. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably the most faithful of the four attempts to turn Bronte's nightmare 
romance into a movie, this version, directed by newcomer Peter Kosminsky and 
adapted by Anne Devlin, happily covers the entire book (spanning 30 years and 
three families at the end of the 18th Century). 
</P>
<P>
 The famous 1939 movie, with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, falsely 
concluded at the point where Catherine died, halfway through the novel, totally 
ignoring the working out of Heathcliff's revenge against the young heirs of his 
despised Earnshaw and Linton families. (The other "Wuthering Heights" movies, 
both disappointments, were by director Luis Bunuel in 1954 and director Robert 
Fuest in 1970.) 
</P>
<P>
 The common deficiency in these four productions is that they dramatize 
altogether a much less fierce, savage love affair than that created by Bronte, 
a quiet, insular woman with a remarkably artistic imagination. Subsequently, 
Heathcliff and Catherine's redemption through death is impossible to convey 
cinematically. 
</P>
<P>
 At least in this newest movie, the tone is personal enough to suggest that, 
psychologically, if the author Bronte can't have Heathcliff, no one can. 
</P>
<P>
 This, by the way, is the Fiennes performance, in a production shot in 1992 for 
a theatrical release in Britain, that prompted Steven Spielberg to cast him as 
the evil commandant in "Schindler's List." Torn between love and hate, he's 
demonic enough here that when he slaps Catherine to the floor, he touches the 
animal/beast by way of the mistreated orphan youth whom we first see. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Binoche's Catherine appears to be a victim of the movie's 
editing. Her wild, passionate, willful side is muted, throwing off her 
chemistry with Fiennes. Her deathbed scene is terribly truncated (it runs to 60 
pages in the book), and she often seems more giggly than possessed. In short, 
it's not clear why Heathcliff would fall for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the script follows the novel in surprising ways. Bronte's moody 
opening on a stormy night is kept intact, hurling you like a stranger into the 
story. And the book's unusual point of view, told from the all-seeing eye of 
the loyal housekeeper, Ellen Dean (the wonderful Janet McTeer), is subtly 
maintained in a medium that doesn't naturally lend itself to a first-person 
point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wuthering Heights" airs today at 5 p.m. and again at 7:30 p.m. on TNT.

OFFICIALS PLOT STRATEGY FOR SAFER SCHOOLS IN MOORPARK; EDUCATION: TEACHERS, 
INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT CAMPUS VIOLENCE, PLAN TO ASK THAT THEIR WORKING 
ENVIRONMENT BE FORMALLY DECLARED DANGEROUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of several violent encounters on campus and reports of students 
with weapons, Moorpark school officials are plotting a strategy to make schools 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though surveys show that students feel safe in school, teachers have 
become increasingly vocal about the dangers they face in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The local teachers union, now in contract negotiations with the Moorpark 
Unified School District, plans to ask county and state officials this week to 
declare Moorpark schools unsafe working environments because of the incidents, 
union President Richard Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis went through a list of episodes, including one last week when a middle 
school student tried to break a teacher's fingers. In another incident, Gillis 
said, a teacher's aide was injured when a student tried to choke her. And a 
teacher had to go on disability leave after she was attacked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the campuses are declared unsafe by the state superintendent of schools 
office or by the county superintendent of schools, Gillis said, any teacher 
injured by violence would qualify for double workers' compensation benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had these incidents of violence without a remedy," he said. "We want 
this treated like other safety hazards." 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators and school board members will meet Tuesday to begin 
developing a plan for dealing with school violence, a plan that could involve 
committees of teachers and administrators at every school. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they point to a recent survey jointly conducted by the county 
superintendent's office and UC Santa Barbara showing that district schools are 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will review the findings from the extensive safety survey, in which 
students said they were worried more about grades than school violence, with 
about 80% of them saying they felt safe on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, some of the information from the survey of students, teachers and 
parents worries board members. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that in recent months, 5% of Moorpark students had been 
threatened with a gun at school, while 6% had been threatened with knives, and 
nearly 3% of teachers surveyed said they had often seen weapons on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the results were surprising for me," board member Clint Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that the teachers union is exploiting the recent reports of 
violence on campus as part of a bitter salary dispute that has dragged on for 
years. Still, he said the survey begs the question about why the board has not 
heard about these incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had indications from some faculty members that they had seen weapons 
on campus, but those reports don't correspond to these numbers," Harper said. 
The results, he said, seem to indicate that teachers and students "are seeing 
weapons at a higher rate than we see reported to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers union has hammered the board and administrators for not taking 
more aggressive action to deal with violence. The union first publicized the 
series of violent encounters at schools after the board voted last month not to 
expel a middle school student caught with a knife on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis said teachers have made an effort to keep reports of violence from 
students, which may be why students reported feeling safe at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, maybe that was not a good idea," he said. "There have always 
been problems, but this year it's really coming to a head, and the board is not 
dealing with them in a direct and forceful manner." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 teachers, parents and staff members signed a petition asking for 
"no tolerance" of weapons on campus. The petition calls for automatic expulsion 
if a student is caught with a weapon or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 As it now stands, students caught with weapons automatically face a 
closed-door expulsion hearing with the school board, but board members are not 
obligated to expel a student if they believe that expulsion is inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does that mean that you expel every kid that brings a pocketknife to school?" 
Harper asked. "I am against kids bringing knives or weapons to school, but I 
believe that each case deserves reasonable judgment by the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the teachers union's assessment of the situation, the survey generally 
indicates that Moorpark's schools are safe, said Richard Morrison, who 
conducted the study for the county superintendent of schools. And the district 
administration, he said, was doing a good job of addressing safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their performance is really laudable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison, who will be at Tuesday's meeting, said he will help interpret the 
data and go over ways to make school grounds even safer. He said that although 
much has been made of violence on campuses across the country, his studies have 
found schools much safer now than they were 10 years ago. Still, he said it is 
unacceptable for even one student to feel unsafe at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite what has been made of the issue, only a very small fraction of the 
students feel unsafe on campus," he said. "But guess what? Those are the kids 
that we find are failing. Improving their environment improves learning."

UNIQUE ZOO, 2 GOLF COURSES ON COUNTY AGENDA; SUPERVISORS: BOARD WILL CONSIDER 
PROPOSALS TUESDAY. BUT ANGRY MOORPARK OFFICIALS HAVE REQUESTED A DELAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eastern Ventura County could eventually get two new golf courses and a 
one-of-a-kind zoo for endangered species under two separate proposals being 
considered by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the first proposal, developer Ralph Mahan is seeking to build two 
18-hole golf courses at Happy Camp Regional Park in Moorpark. Officials 
estimate that the project could generate between $250,000 and $500,000 annually 
for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate proposal, a Los Angeles-based group wants to lease a county park 
between Moorpark and Simi Valley that it plans to eventually develop into a zoo 
for endangered animals. Supporters say the zoo would be a world-class tourist 
attraction that would pump millions of dollars into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Moorpark officials agree that the projects could prove beneficial to 
their city, they believe that the county is moving too quickly on both 
proposals and are upset that the city has not been allowed more input. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors will consider entering into lease agreements with 
both Mahan and the backers of the zoo project at its meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason, however, said his city would like more time to 
gather information about both projects and has asked the board to postpone its 
consideration of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to be involved in the process, and the county for whatever reason 
has chosen to keep us uninformed," he said. "And we're a little perturbed about 
it. No, we're very perturbed about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard, whose district includes Moorpark, was unavailable for 
comment. And Mahan, who proposed the golf course project, declined to talk 
about the development. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of the Department of Recreation Services have argued that the 
golf courses could generate additional revenues for the county that could be 
used to pay for upkeep of other parks. In exchange for using the site, the 
developer would be required to return at least 5% of its profits, which could 
range from $250,000 to $500,000, to the county each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Moorpark officials said they are concerned that building golf courses 
at Happy Camp, just north of the city, could greatly increase traffic through 
Moorpark and spur further development in the area. They also point out that 
there are already plans for three golf courses in Moorpark and worry that five 
may be too many for the area to support. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, "we're going to get all of the impacts and none of the 
benefits," Lawrason said of the proposed golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also concerned about potential traffic problems that would 
result if a zoo being proposed by a nonprofit group were built between Moorpark 
and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Endangered Species Zoological Society of Los Angeles wants to build an 
open-air zoo for more than 500 rare animals at Oak Park, a 115-acre 
county-owned park situated between the Simi Valley Freeway and Los Angeles 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a world-class tourist attraction that we think will be of 
great benefit to Ventura County," said Mark Cartland, president of the 
zoological society. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartland said the Endangered Species EcoPark would be the first in the nation 
to house only rare animals in a wildlife preserve setting. He said the park 
would also serve as a major educational center by providing visitors with 
valuable information about the environment and endangered animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixty-thousand schoolchildren live within 15 minutes of the park, and that is 
our real audience," Cartland said. The park, he added, would provide new jobs 
and additional revenues for local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartland said his group will be asking the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to 
approve a lease agreement, which would give the organization one to four years 
to secure funding and get construction plans approved for the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Once built, the zoo could draw up to 250,000 visitors a year, he said. While 
this could present some traffic problems, Cartland said he believed that these 
could be resolved through good planning. He also noted that some of the roads 
in the area now handle less traffic than they are designed to accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorpark Councilman Bernardo Perez said he is concerned about who will pay 
for traffic improvements if they are needed. He said the zoo could greatly 
increase traffic at the Collins Drive exit off the Simi Valley Freeway as well 
as on nearby side streets. 
</P>
<P>
 If this were to occur, Perez said the city would probably ask the county to 
pay for traffic and road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez also pointed out that development of a zoo would mean that Oak Park 
would no longer be able to provide other recreational activities to the public. 
The park is now equipped with overnight camping facilities and has a field set 
aside specifically for model airplane enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is questioning the value of a tourist attraction," Perez said. "But we 
have to look at all the impacts. The big question to me is, 'Why doesn't the 
county include Moorpark early on in the process of evaluating these projects?' 
I don't know what we have to do to say that more clearly or loudly." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials were not available for comment on the zoo; however, the 
city did not file any complaints with the county over the proposal.

NEW OXNARD COUNCILMAN REAPS SOBERING REALITIES; GOVERNMENT: ELECTION EUPHORIA 
HAS PASSED FOR DEAN L. MAULHARDT, NOW ADJUSTING TO LIFE IN THE SCRUTINIZING 
LIMELIGHT OF POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Friends and relatives worried that Dean L. Maulhardt, a soft-spoken 
businessman and descendant of two prominent farming families, was making an 
embarrassing mistake earlier this year when he decided to run for the Oxnard 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The shy Maulhardt, who had worked on the family farm for 20 years growing 
lemons, strawberries and avocados, was simply not political timber, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their animosity came across like 'Dean, what are you getting yourself into?' 
" said Michael Clarke, a longtime friend. "The Maulhardt family has always been 
involved in politics, but kind of behind the scenes. This was a big jump into 
the limelight." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Maulhardt, also known by family members and business associates for his 
steadfastness, went forward with his plan to bring a member of Oxnard's 
founding families back to power, prodded by another friend, outgoing Councilman 
Michael A. Plisky. 
</P>
<P>
 His announcement was quickly followed by strong support from his 
well-connected relatives, other local farmers such as the McGrath family and, 
in turn, the city's business establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Maulhardt emerged second in a field of 11 candidates seeking two council 
seats, beating out John C. Zaragoza, who was widely favored to win along with 
incumbent Tom Holden, who was the top vote-getter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the election euphoria has passed, however, the conservative Maulhardt 
is sobering up to the realities of public office. 
</P>
<P>
 His opinions on touchy issues such as city-subsidized housing and 
redevelopment are being closely scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
 And his once-private finances -- such as the $176,000 he owes in back taxes 
and assessment payments as a partner in a botched land deal -- are now part of 
Oxnard's public discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit I'm naive when it comes to politics, but I see that as a plus," 
Maulhardt said. "Working with city managers and city leaders is a business 
relationship. That probably is a naive statement, but I plan to approach 
government like a business and get acquainted with politics as I go along." 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth-generation Oxnard farmer, the 44-year-old Maulhardt is a descendant 
of the pioneering Borchard and Maulhardt families, which settled in the Oxnard 
Plain about 140 years ago. He is also related to the Friedrichs, another early 
farming family. 
</P>
<P>
 One of five children, Maulhardt grew up in the wholesome environment of his 
father's ranch in an era when Oxnard still felt like a small town and the 
Maulhardts were well known to the city's residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maulhardt attended what is now Loyola Marymount University to study business 
and prepare for a career in law. But he missed the farm, and he drove home from 
college almost every week to help his father tend to the difficult strawberry 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I graduated from college, I was kind of tired," Maulhardt said. "I said 
I was going to go to law school, but I wanted to farm one year to rest. I never 
went back." 
</P>
<P>
 Maulhardt and his four brothers and sisters formed a partnership and bought 
out their father's operation shortly afterward, with Maulhardt farming his 
father's land along with some rented acreage. He farmed for about 20 years, 
including his college days. 
</P>
<P>
 Maulhardt met his wife, Toni, while in college in 1970, and they married two 
years later. They have two daughters, Stacy, 20, and Jaime, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 With his sister, Donna, and her husband, Gary Stiles, Maulhardt bought the 
family farming operation in the early 1980s and formed the Maulhardt Stiles 
Co., which grew, packed and shipped produce. Maulhardt bought out Stiles a few 
years later, but eventually disbanded the company. 
</P>
<P>
 He was tired of struggling as a small farmer and was seeking a new career, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After working several years as a computer consultant, last year Maulhardt and 
two partners started an agricultural packaging business, Quality Packaging & 
Supplies Inc., which he now manages. 
</P>
<P>
 During his career as a rancher, Maulhardt considered becoming an Oxnard 
councilman, a position held by his cousin, Edwin Carty, in the 1950s. But he 
decided that he did not have the time. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until Plisky and Maulhardt's cousin, developer Stephen Maulhardt, 
urged him to run for the council this year that he seriously considered public 
office. Maulhardt's relatives, friends and business partners -- even his wife 
-- were all stunned when he decided to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dean's just not a very outgoing person," Toni Maulhardt said. "I didn't feel 
he would be comfortable speaking in public." 
</P>
<P>
 Maulhardt's pro-business platform was similar to Holden's successful formula, 
emphasizing the need for more police officers and Neighborhood Watch programs, 
and pledging to cut Oxnard's government and run the city like a business. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he lacked the speaking skills of some other candidates, Maulhardt had 
one advantage over them all -- name recognition, which he admits probably 
helped his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he is Oxnard's newly elected councilman, Maulhardt has received 
advice from Plisky on sticking to his guns, refusing to sell his ideas short 
and avoiding the pitfalls of elected office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he declined to comment on Plisky's admittedly uncompromising approach 
to the City Council, Maulhardt said he will try to work together with his 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think in one mind, but we have to make decisions as a group," Maulhardt 
said. "Coming from a large family with substantial business dealings, you 
haven't seen any negotiating until you have seen us." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet one family business venture has put Maulhardt and his siblings in debt to 
Oxnard and the county for about $176,000 in back tax payments and assessments, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Maulhardt, his brother Richard Jr. and their other three siblings 
sold 33 acres of farmland in northeast Oxnard to the Latigo Investment Group, a 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The land, in Oxnard's $45-million northeast industrial assessment district, 
was paved over by the city, which also put in streets and storm drains for the 
40 lots the developer divided. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latigo was unable to sell any of the lots. The developer could not make 
its regular payments to the Maulhardts for the land, or to the city and the 
county for the improvements and property taxes, Maulhardt said. Consequently, 
the Maulhardts were forced to take the property back in 1993 through 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck with a vacant parcel they were unable to sell or farm, the Maulhardts 
were forced to make back payments on the land of $130,000 for one year by 
borrowing money against the family farm, Maulhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
 They have yet to make last year's or this spring's payments, and will not be 
able to make the Dec. 10 payments, said Richard Maulhardt Jr., who was in 
charge of the investment until the foreclosure, when Dean L. Maulhardt assumed 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Maulhardt, who owns one-fifth of the property, said he and his siblings intend 
to find a way to pay, and they will continue to try to sell the land. He 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Oxnard will move forward with foreclosure proceedings against 
Maulhardt and other delinquent property owners in the assessment district, said 
Jim Fabian, city financial analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the unwanted attention to his business dealings and private life, 
Maulhardt said he is beginning to enjoy his new status, attending community 
events and meeting with city officials to learn what his job is like. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Oxnard community leaders and advocates for the city's poor 
say they are trying to learn what Maulhardt is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen McCarthy of California Rural Legal Assistance said she hopes that 
Maulhardt's experience as a grower made him sympathetic to the plight of farm 
workers and their need for low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hopeful that as someone who has worked in the agricultural community, he 
understands the needs of farm workers," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maulhardt said he understands the life of a farm worker, but he downplayed 
their role in the affordable housing issue, saying most Oxnard residents in 
need of low-cost housing do not work the fields. He added that farm work is not 
as bad as some have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some farm working pays very well, especially considering the educational 
level of the workers," said Maulhardt, who supports building city-subsidized 
condominiums to relieve the affordable housing shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Maulhardt said his friends, relatives and fellow farmers are 
enjoying the fruits of his success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we have come full circle, but we are back in power," 
Maulhardt said. "Hopefully, there will be more generations of Maulhardts in 
politics in Oxnard."

STREET SMART: CALTRANS DOES KNOW THE EXACT LOCATION OF CALL BOXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I called Caltrans to report a sprinkler that was watering the Ventura 
Freeway instead of the foliage next to it. 
</P>
<P>
 I told the person taking my call the exact location: next to a call box whose 
number I had written down. 
</P>
<P>
 This person then told me that Caltrans does not have a map indicating call-box 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 How can this be? 
</P>
<P>
 I know the Highway Patrol has the location of the boxes, so why not Caltrans? 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Marshall, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, although the state Department of Transportation is not responsible 
for maintaining the call boxes, the agency does know where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 The county and the cities provide the funding for the call boxes and are 
responsible for installing and caring for them. Caltrans' only input is in 
advising where the boxes should be located. 
</P>
<P>
 Each call box is assigned a number, which corresponds with a number that 
Caltrans uses to indicate post miles along the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, not everybody here is aware that the numbers on the call boxes are 
the same numbers we use for reference," said Bob Houle, traffic engineer for 
Caltrans. "But the fact is, we do know where all the boxes are." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for your column. It is the first thing I read after the front page. 
</P>
<P>
 My problem has to do with the Santa Rosa-Pleasant Valley off-ramp from the 
eastbound Ventura Freeway. At the top of the ramp, turning left to Santa Rosa 
Road is a frightening experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever painted the lanes seems to have made the turns too sharp. The 
left-lane car invariably ends up with its front end projecting into the second 
lane. To avoid a collision, the second-lane car is forced into an unmarked 
third lane. 
</P>
<P>
 There must be a better way of angling the lanes at the turn, so that cars are 
able to stay in their own lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is not corrected, there will be a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Cele Porges, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your concern puzzles Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency completed an overhaul of this off-ramp in 1992, and the angle of 
the turns conforms with state codes, engineer Luu Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen observed traffic at the intersection and checked accident reports for 
the area, but found nothing to indicate that the turn is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing unusual about the angle of this turn," Nguyen said. "Perhaps 
if drivers slow down, it will solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Driving west on the Simi Valley Freeway as it connects with the southbound 
Moorpark Freeway, I find a lack of signs until I am just at the point where the 
two freeways come together. 
</P>
<P>
 This can be very confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't there be signs along these freeways alerting drivers to the change so 
that we will know we are going the right way? 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Spivak, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Not only could there be signs, there should be signs informing drivers of the 
connection of the two freeways, says Bob Houle, traffic engineer for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 After sending a crew out to survey the area, Caltrans discovered that there 
are not enough signs to adequately warn drivers about the transition between 
the two freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, the signs were never installed after the freeway connector 
was completed in the fall of 1993, Houle says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it is now, it is very confusing," Houle said. The lack of signs "was 
an oversight." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs should be up within the next several weeks. STREET-LIGHT ALERT 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Ventura residents have been flooding the city's traffic 
department with complaints about burned-out street lights. The city wishes to 
inform residents that Southern California Edison is responsible for the upkeep 
of the lights. To report a burned-out light, please call Edison at 647-9250 or 
(800) 442-4950.

BUYING INTO HOLIDAY SPIRIT; THOUSANDS VISIT STREET FESTIVAL IN VENTURA TO SHOP 
FOR GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Two giant cardboard lollipops in his right hand and a wallet full of cash in 
his pocket, Clarence Dobbe of Ventura was searching for the ideal Christmas 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a long way to go," the 64-year-old machine shop worker said as his 
wife, Betty, wandered up from a nearby crafts booth. "So we'll collect each 
other and start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dobbes were among the thousands of people who flooded Ventura's downtown 
Sunday to shop at the 18th annual Holiday Street Festival, an arts and crafts 
fair that stretches along six blocks of Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come every year," said Betty Dobbe, 60. "We bring our whole family." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers called the festival a success, despite overcast skies and the 
daylong threat of rain. About 450 artisans offered everything from wind chimes 
and jewelry to handmade clown figures and crystal wands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Year after year we get these crowds," said Faye Campbell, fair director and 
special events coordinator for the city of Ventura, which hosted the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people just love these street fairs," Campbell said. "They love to shop; 
they run into friends and they can munch out." 
</P>
<P>
 At the food booth run by the Buena High School marching band, volunteers 
wearing red Santa caps dispensed funnel cake and nachos to hungry shoppers to 
raise money for a musical competition in Calgary, Canada, next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has been brisk," said Janna Valenzuela, whose daughter, Maddie, 
plays in the band. "They're mostly buying the funnel cake. It's very sinful 
because it's fried, it's got whipped cream, fruit toppings and powdered sugar. 
They're wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Clark of Ventura started cruising Main Street at 11 a.m., when the 
street fair got under way. She brought her 11-year-old daughter, Sara, and 
their next-door neighbor, Carolyn Kleider, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Both young girls wore freshly painted faces and T-shirts emblazoned with the 
street fair logo. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came this morning and decorated the stages, so they got free shirts," 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara and Carolyn proudly displayed their sole purchases: $5 bottles filled 
with colored sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got to fill them up ourselves," Carolyn said, licking the last of her 
chocolate-dipped cone. "I got all the good colors. I'm going to put it in a box 
and wrap it for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Doughty of La Mirada makes about 80 musical clowns a week, dressing 
them up in colorful clothes and selling them at street fairs like the one in 
Ventura for $27 to $30 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll play 10,000 times, and (customers) get to pick out whatever tune they 
want," the vendor said. "Everybody likes a clown. Everybody likes to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the corner of Main and Chestnut streets, Ventura homemaker Wendy Raines 
was struggling with several bags of arts and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already made one trip to the car," she said, looking down at the bags 
filled with wreaths made from dried flowers. "We spent well over $100." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Barbara Geyer, piped in quickly: "Add another $100 for the food. 
We've been eating since we got here." 
</P>
<P>
 Parting with the money did not bother Geyer, who said she shops at the 
downtown street fair every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff is homemade," she said, pointing to a $22 basket of dried flowers. 
"People go to a lot of trouble to do this. And there's a real Christmas spirit 
here."

BARRED DURING SCHOOL HOURS FROM FIVE-ACRE PLOT NEXT TO CAMPUS. THEY CONTEND 
IT'S A PUBLIC PARK. ISSUE IS TO BE DEBATED WEDNESDAY.

<P>
 It looks like your average, standard-issue chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 But to many residents around Tierra Linda School in Camarillo's Mission Oaks 
area, the fence that surrounds a grassy five-acre field does not represent a 
safety precaution for schoolchildren, but a barrier excluding them from what 
they believe is a public park. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the Pleasant Valley School District finished construction of 
the elementary school this summer, the area's park and recreation district 
ordered that a six-foot-high fence be installed around the play field adjacent 
to the new school for kindergarten through third grade. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, residents along Lynwood Drive and other nearby streets thought that 
the parks district was simply enclosing the lot to allow newly seeded grass to 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
 However, soon after the grass grew in, they discovered that the barrier was 
permanent and that they would be able to use the grassy expanse only after 
school and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "They basically gave our park away," resident Johanna Milford said. "The 
ironic thing is that from what we can see is that this was always intended to 
be a public park. You can see it on Thomas Guide maps and you can see it on the 
tract map that was recorded by the county." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, both a Ventura County tract map and the 1994 Ventura County Thomas 
Guide show a Woodcreek Park at Woodcreek Road and Lynwood Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eldred Lokker, general manager of the Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park 
District, said a 1991 agreement with the school district committed the parks 
district to build a park to be shared by the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Although entrances at various points along the fence have been installed, they 
have been sealed from use by the public. Those wanting to use the facility must 
enter through a main gate next to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time the agreement was made, officials did not anticipate that the 
shared-use concept would create any controversy, Lokker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There lies the crux of the problem," he said. "It is an open question whether 
or not members of the public can use the facility during school hours. There's 
nothing in the agreement that addresses that." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials say that although the facility is open to the public 
during after-school hours and on weekends, safety concerns for schoolchildren 
require that the entire play field be closed when school is in session. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bulletin distributed Nov. 29 to parents, Tierra Linda Principal Dianne 
Quinby-Anders said she and the school's Parent Teacher Assn. "adamantly oppose" 
any public use of Woodcreek Park during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors say they were led to believe that the site would be a park and 
not under control of the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who purchased homes in this neighborhood did so believing they would 
be located near a public park," said Joel Granath, a 10-year resident of the 
neighborhood. "What we have now is just a school playground, and we are not 
welcome there." 
</P>
<P>
 Milford and Granath, along with some of the 200 Woodcreek-area residents who 
signed a petition against the fence and the shared-use plan, said they will 
argue their case before the board of directors of the Pleasant Valley 
Recreation and Park District during its meeting at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At that meeting, the parks district board is expected to reach a decision on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors opposed to the school's use of the park say they will seek to have 
the fence line along Lynwood Drive moved back from the street, effectively 
leaving about half of the play field for the public's use. 
</P>
<P>
 Lokker, in an attempt to offer a compromise, suggested to officials earlier 
this year that a section of the play field facing Woodcreek Road be fenced off 
and dedicated to the public's use. The parks district would install such 
amenities as picnic tables and play equipment for young children there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They accepted the positioning of the picnic tables and play equipment, but 
balked on the idea of installing a second fence," Lokker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Hamilton, the school district's associate superintendent, said he 
understood the concerns of the neighbors, but said it was his district's 
decision to build Tierra Linda that in turn prompted the parks district to move 
up the facility on its list of priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "One decision prompted another," he said. "That place would still be in 
tumbleweeds if it wasn't for the fact that we needed to build that school there 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was a good, cooperative agreement," he said. "We thought it 
would be a win-win for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's meeting, Hamilton said school officials hope that the parks 
board will honor its shared-use agreement and will ask that the play field's 
fences be kept where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Sherri Varnum, who has a daughter in the first grade at Tierra Linda, 
the issue should not be about what stimulated the park's development, it should 
be whether the public has access to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, my position on this hasn't made me the most popular parent" at 
the school, Varnum said. "But I just don't feel it's right for the school to 
take over a park for most of the day." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District board of directors will 
consider the issue of public access and fence locations at Woodcreek Park 
during its meeting at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday. The directors will meet at the 
Camarillo Community Center, 1605 E. Burnley St.

NOT JUST FOR SMALL TALK; TOASTMASTERS HELP PEOPLE GAIN CONFIDENCE IN PUBLIC 
SPEAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Make no mistake about it, most people don't like to get up before a large 
group to give a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's what members of the six Conejo Valley chapters of 
Toastmasters International will tell you. 
</P>
<P>
 Toastmasters is a group in which people learn to step up to the microphone 
with confidence. And members explain their involvement by reciting their view 
that the fear of public speaking outranks the fear of death 2-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 They add that public speaking would surely outrank the fear of flying, fear of 
the dark, and even the fear of sipping from a sick friend's straw, if such a 
survey were ever undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the No. 1 thing people are afraid of," said Laraine Ferguson, who 
presides over 200 club members in the Conejo Valley. "A lot of people don't 
realize it until you put them up in front of a room full of people. Then 
they'll know exactly what we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Every week, secretaries and business executives, real estate agents and 
retirees slip away for two hours to practice public speaking in a controlled 
environment, where meeting halls act as incubators for self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a speaker's sandbox," said Jim Graham, a Toastmaster and former FBI 
agent. "We learn to be comfortable here so we can be comfortable anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The groups largely comprise people who work in such professions as real estate 
and sales, where presentations are a staple. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the local clubs are sponsored by corporations -- two by State Farm 
Insurance Co. and one by bioengineering giant Amgen Inc. Members of each of 
those clubs practice their speaking skills with company co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The other groups are open clubs, and members are diverse in age, gender and 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 At every meeting, Toastmasters stick to an established routine that begins 
with two extemporaneous speeches. Members are chosen at random and provided 
topics to speak on for three to five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with this daunting task, some speakers speed through the five-minute 
talk while others lose focus and stumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, warm cajoling is accompanied by the frequent clang of a bell, 
tapped to alert the speakers that they have tripped over a word, or 
accidentally slipped on an "um" or an "ah." 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to walk a line where we're supportive but we also give gentle 
criticism," said Patrick Millar, one of the leaders of the Thousand Oaks club. 
"The goal is improvement, and if we give no evaluation of the speeches, then no 
one's going to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 After the impromptu speeches, two members present prepared talks of five to 
seven minutes. When they are finished, other members step forward to offer 
their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, what we try to do is give the evaluation like a sandwich," said 
Erich Briggs, president of one Thousand Oaks club. "We surround the meaty, 
critical remarks with compliments." 
</P>
<P>
 The friendly approach has a purpose, Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each one of these people has come to the group for a reason, and we don't 
want them to be afraid to get up and give this a try," he said. "The 
encouragement is an essential part of helping people overcome their fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as real estate agent Linda Carson, joined after several other 
self-help courses and groups had failed her. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fear of communication goes back to my childhood," Carson said. "I was deaf 
in one ear, so when people spoke to me, I sometimes said the wrong thing in 
response." 
</P>
<P>
 Teased and taunted by other children, Carson said she became introverted and 
shy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the idea of speaking in public made my knees shake," she said. "This 
became the major issue in my life that I needed to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said she joined Toastmasters because it forced her to speak up. And 
every speech is a triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even describe how it makes me feel," she said. "It gives you a great 
sense of accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Toastmasters International was founded 70 years ago in the basement of the 
Santa Ana YMCA. With 8,100 chapters worldwide and more than 170,000 members, 
the group has capitalized on the business community's increasing need for 
people who can communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "People realized they could get ahead in business if they could get up in a 
board room and give a well-prepared, organized presentation," Ferguson said. 
"That's why corporations latched on to the idea with such enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
 Major corporations such as Rockwell International Corp., McDonnell Douglas 
Space Systems Co. and Bergen Brunswig Corp. all have Toastmasters chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 And Toastmasters graduates include such top executives as Paul Orreffice, 
former chairman of Dow Chemical Co.; Peter Coors, chief executive of Coors 
Brewing Co., and Les McCraw, chief executive of Fluor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as many members, however, are independent business people looking for 
ways to excel in crowded markets, and homemakers hoping to build their 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Graham, a published poet who joined the Thousand Oaks club two years ago, 
said preparing and practicing her short speeches has actually aided her 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has helped me organize my thoughts and it taught me to set and meet 
goals," Graham said. "And you become very aware of the need to be judicious 
with language." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Graham said, Toastmasters has offered a unique atmosphere in 
which to bond with strangers from her community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very eclectic group," she said of the Thousand Oaks club that meets 
Thursday nights. "You develop an immediate connection with everyone because you 
know you're all feeling the same things." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, longtime member Bill Ferguson said, members realize that the task 
at hand -- improving public speaking -- is a vehicle for a range of 
accomplishments that vary from person to person. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, Toastmasters is a safe haven," he said. "You try things out 
here that you can't try in the real world because it doesn't cost you anything 
to fail."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: WESTLAKE; FESTIVE HOMES DRAW 2,000 FOR HOLIDAY TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Looking for some holiday cheer -- and last-minute decorating tips -- nearly 
2,000 people toured the homes of four Westlake-area families Sunday during the 
third annual Wellness Community's Holiday Home Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for being allowed a peek inside the elaborately decorated homes, the 
crowd paid up to $12 apiece for tickets.The event netted an estimated $20,000 
for the Wellness Community, which provides counseling to cancer patients and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people like this event because it gives them the chance to see what 
the inside of these lovely homes look like," said Diana Malmquist, event 
chairwoman. "These people go all out in decorating their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the homes on the tour was that of Jerry and Karen Orefice in Sherwood 
Country Club Estates. The huge home, constructed in a traditional colonial 
brick and wood design, used poinsettias and other elaborate holiday floral 
arrangements in every room. 
</P>
<P>
 A professional floral designer, Karen Orefice said she personally prepared 
each room's presentation for the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lines started forming at 11:30 a.m. and it's been a steady stream ever 
since," Orefice said as she sat on a kitchen stool and greeted a long line of 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people have been so nice. It has been a joy to do this because Wellness 
does so much good out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other houses on the tour featured an old-fashioned Christmas, Southwest and 
French country holiday themes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lindy Noe of Agoura, the tour was an excellent way to kick off the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fabulous," Noe said. "I can't believe what trouble these people go to."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RESIDENTS MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR SPEED HUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The average cost of installing a speed hump is $2,000, and that is how much 
county residents in unincorporated areas may have to dole out to have the 
traffic-control devices installed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors will consider Tuesday a proposal that makes it easier 
for residents to request the humps, but at the same time requires petitioners 
to pay the cost of installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, only three county roads have speed humps, with the last installed 
in 1989, according to a report prepared for the board by William Britt, deputy 
director of public works. The humps, which measure about four inches high and 
12 feet wide, have been effective in slowing traffic an average of seven m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, Britt notes that in the last five years, his office has 
received about 50 requests for speed humps. All were turned down, however, 
because they did not meet county criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of limited funds for traffic officers, Britt notes in his report that 
alternative methods for controlling traffic are needed in some areas. He 
recommends that the county ease its criteria. CARLOS V. LOZANO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; CITY COUNCIL WILL PICK MAYOR TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of newly elected Councilwoman Laura Flores Espinosa's first official acts 
will be to cast the deciding vote for mayor of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after Espinosa and Councilman-elect Don Johnson are sworn in tonight, 
the council is scheduled to choose the city's mayor for the next year.The 
council appears to be split 2 to 2 between Mayor Pro Tem Robin Sullivan or 
Councilman John Melton. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinosa's is the fifth vote. "I haven't made up my mind yet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, who has been on the council two years, said she should be appointed 
mayor because she served as mayor pro tem this year; "it's kind of a natural." 
Johnson said he will vote for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the last 12 Santa Paula mayors served as mayor pro tem immediately 
before their appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Alfonso Urias said he will forgo tradition and nominate Melton. 
Urias unsuccessfully nominated Melton last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the same political stances," Urias said. Melton, who served as mayor 
in 1986-87 and 1991, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting has been moved to the Santa Paula Community Center, 530 W. 
Main St. The heating system in the City Council chambers releases carbon 
monoxide when it is used and is awaiting repairs, City Administrator Arnold 
Dowdy said. PAUL ELIAS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; POLICE GANG SWEEP NETS 30 SUSPECTS

<P>
 An Oxnard Police Department gang sweep resulted in more than 30 arrests, 
including for four felonies and the recovery of a stolen firearm, officials 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's gang-enforcement team contacted more than 115 suspected gang 
members over three nights ending Saturday, Sgt. Charles Hookstra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers made four felony arrests, two misdemeanor arrests and 25 arrests 
for alleged violations of the city's curfew law. Of the four felony arrests, 
three of those taken into custody were Oxnard juveniles arrested on suspicion 
of stealing a car, burglary and possession of a .357-Magnum revolver, Hookstra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased enforcement was planned in response to an escalating series of 
gang incidents over the past several weeks, including three drive-by shootings, 
he said. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CHURCH SERVES FREE HOLIDAY MEAL TO NEEDY 
</P>

<P>
 It's a good feeling to be remembered at Christmas. Especially when you feel 
forgotten, or at least that's what Sally says. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old disabled heavy-equipment operator lives in a van with her 
unemployed 20-year-old son. But Sally -- in a red and white Santa's cap -- took 
advantage of some holiday cheer and a free meal provided by Oxnard's First 
Baptist Church on Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally and her son, Cory, were among about 70 men, women and children who were 
welcomed into the 5th Street church for a Christmas dinner, carols and a warm 
place to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "They serve good food on clean plates," Sally said. "Somehow, even when you 
have no food, God will provide it, but it's nice to have something like this 
once in awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 The church started serving free suppers in March to all comers on the first 
Saturday of each month. But Saturday's dinner was special, featuring a 
traditional baked ham, mashed potatoes and an assortment of more than 30 
home-baked pies.

 Two private planes collided over Santa Paula Airport on Sunday afternoon, but 
both pilots suffered only minor injuries from the accident and were able to 
walk away from the wreckage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2:30 p.m. accident occurred after a westbound Grumman monoplane flown by 
Jeffrey Jacobs, 54, of Simi Valley collided with an eastbound Great Lakes 
biplane flown by Joe Lansden, 56, also of Simi Valley, according to Santa Paula 
Police Agent Carlos Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez said the two pilots were attempting to land when their planes collided 
over the east end of the runway. No other injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 When rescue units arrived at the airport, both pilots were out of their 
planes, Juarez said. Lansden was taken to Santa Paula Memorial Hospital where 
he was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the crash, the Great Lakes biplane caught fire, but the blaze was 
quickly extinguished. J.E. MITCHELL

BALLPLAYER PLUNGES TO HIS DEATH OFF FREEWAY; ACCIDENT: MINOR LEAGUE PITCHER 
DAVID EGGERT, A FORMER VENTURA COLLEGE AND CSUN STANDOUT, APPARENTLY FELL 
ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Minor league pitcher David Eggert was killed early Sunday after he apparently 
fell asleep at the wheel of his car and crashed into a tree near the junction 
of the Ventura Freeway and California 126, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggert, a former Ventura College and Cal State Northridge standout who signed 
a contract with the Montreal Expos baseball club in 1992, died at the scene of 
the crash about 2:15 a.m., Ventura County medical officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old Ventura native had come home for the off-season and was 
preparing to report to spring training in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could hit a baseball a long way," said his father, also named David 
Eggert. "He was a strong boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Deputy Coroner Zelmira Isaac said Eggert was traveling south on the 
Ventura Freeway just miles from his home when he lost control of his white 1991 
Ford Escort and plummeted down an embankment near the California 126 turnoff. 
</P>
<P>
 He was alone in the car and died instantly when it struck a eucalyptus tree, 
Isaac said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident left the athlete's family in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping that he would make Triple A this year," his father said. 
"Given the opportunity, he was going back out there and giving it another shot. 
He loved it more than anything. It's all he'd been groomed for his whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 Eggert's high school coaches remembered him Sunday as a star athlete in both 
football and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an excellent player," Ventura High baseball coach Dan Smith said. "We 
went to the semifinals that year (1987). He didn't pitch much in high school, 
but he was a dandy." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and former teammates described Eggert as an aggressive left-handed 
pitcher who always worked as hard as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good competitor," said Mike Sims, a minor league catcher who caught 
Eggert's pitches at CSUN. "He went out there all the time and gave 100%. He was 
a guy that made people laugh off the field, but once he got on the field, he 
was all business." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, Eggert had attended a party with co-workers from his 
off-season job at the Big 5 sporting goods store in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found no evidence that he had been drinking, but toxicology 
tests will be performed, Isaac said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not a heavy drinker, not ever," Eggert's father said. "But that 
doesn't mean he couldn't have had some. (Investigators) feel like he had just 
gone to sleep at the wheel. That's what all indications were." 
</P>
<P>
 Eggert played right field and was a relief pitcher for Ventura High School 
before enrolling at Ventura College. There, he helped his team take the 1989 
Western State Conference title in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most talented pitching staff we'd had," said Don Adams, an 
assistant at the time, now the Ventura College baseball coach. That team had a 
record of 29-9, and Eggert was an all-conference utility player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was intense," Adams said. "His goal was to make it to the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 He next played two seasons at CSUN before being drafted in the 21st round of 
the 1992 amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggert is survived by his wife, Julie; a 3-year-old stepdaughter, Brittnee, 
and a 2-month-old son, Shawn. He is also survived by his parents, David and 
Cindy-Lou Eggert; a brother, John, and sister, Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral arrangements are pending.

SHOP TALK: BONUS PAY FOR HOLIDAY WORK IS NOT REQUIRED BY LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or 
call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice-mail message with your name and where you 
live. Questions of general interest will be answered in this column on Mondays.

 Question: I work at a small company with about 25 part-time employees who are 
paid on an hourly basis. There are only a couple of people on staff. The owner 
is contemplating opening for business on Dec. 26 and Jan. 2. Will we need to 
pay twice the regular hourly rate for employees working on those days when the 
Christmas and New Year's Day holidays are generally observed? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No. Although double-time pay for holidays is often provided under a 
union contract or company policy, there is no law requiring that employees be 
paid extra simply for working on holidays. Normal overtime laws would apply, 
however. If non-exempt employees would be required to work more than 40 hours 
in a workweek as a result of your being open for business on a holiday, they 
would be entitled to the applicable overtime premium.

 Question: Can an employee be required to work a split shift, such as 7 a.m. to 
2 p.m. and then have to come back for one hour, from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m., in 
order to make up an eight-hour workday? And then can the employer require the 
employee to come back at 8 a.m. the next morning? 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.E., El Toro 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes, the employer does have a right to schedule employees to work 
different hours to meet business obligations. Let's also define what is a split 
shift. Whenever an employer-established work schedule is interrupted by an 
unpaid, non-working period other than regular rest or meal periods, it becomes 
a split shift. If an employee, however, requests the interruption in the work 
schedule, or time off for their personal convenience, technically it is not a 
split shift. 
</P>
<P>
 If on the other hand, an employer requires the employee to work the split 
shift, then a split-shift premium must be paid. Typically the obligation would 
affect only employees whose hourly rate of pay was at minimum wage or slightly 
higher.

 Question: I work as a temporary engineer for a small company. I'm paid on an 
hourly, W-2 basis. I was told that if your hourly wage is either five or seven 
times greater than the state's minimum wage, then you are only entitled to 
straight time for any work performed over eight hours in a day or 40 hours in a 
week. What are the rules regarding overtime for employees such as myself? 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.R., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: One of the most misunderstood and abused labor laws in Southern 
California concerns overtime rules. The Shop Talk column appears to answer more 
questions regarding overtime than any other topic. According to the more 
protective state rules, non-exempt employees working more than eight hours in 
one day or 40 hours in one week receive 1 1/2 times their normal compensation 
for those hours. Employees working seven days in a row receive for the seventh 
day 1 1/2 times their normal compensation for the first eight hours and twice 
beyond that. Employees working more than 12 hours in any one day receive twice 
their normal compensation for such time. 
</P>
<P>
 According to federal rules, if you are not paid on a salary basis, you are 
non-exempt and entitled to such compensation. There are other rules that have 
been discussed previously in this column regarding exemptions. There is no rule 
restricting you from receiving overtime compensation if your hourly wage is 
five or seven times greater than the state's minimum wage, as your employer 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
 The only exception that even comes close to this is one for mercantile, retail 
or service establishments that make employees exempt if more than half of their 
compensation is in the form of commissions and their compensation is more than 
1 1/2 the minimum wage rate. As an engineer, who is presumably not an a 
commission basis, you do not qualify for this exemption. Thus, you would be 
entitled to the appropriate overtime compensation.

 Question: I worked for a Fortune 500 company. The division I worked for was 
sold to a company in Texas, and I decided to give Texas a chance. If I now 
decide the commute isn't working, because my fiance and my children are here, 
would I be eligible for unemployment? -- B.F, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You are disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits if you quit 
your job without sufficient work-related cause. Such cause could include some 
change in the job or working conditions caused by your employer that would make 
a reasonable person quit under the circumstances (e.g., if an employee worked 
the same shift for a period of time and the employer changed the shift against 
the employee's wishes and the employee was unable to work the alternate shift 
for some good reason). Another reason might include the employer requiring you 
to travel frequently and you can't accommodate the schedule to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty in your case is that you are working for essentially a new 
employer in Texas, and it was your choice to commute. The fact that the commute 
is not working out is likely not due to a change in job or working conditions 
caused by your employer, which means you probably are not eligible for 
unemployment compensation benefits.

 Question: We're all salaried customer-support representatives for a computer 
software company. We were told that our regular work week was 45 hours, and 
that we don't receive overtime after working 45 hours. And when we do get paid 
overtime, it is paid at a rate of our weekly salary divided by 45, not by 40. 
</P>
<P>
 In April we were told orally that we would receive a weekly pay raise. On our 
paychecks, the amounts are not broken out an hourly basis, so it is difficult 
to determine how much the raise actually was. When I ultimately figured it out, 
I found that the raise was about $20 a month less than what I and five other 
employees were promised. Do I have any rights in this regard? 
</P>
<P>
 Are companies required by law to detail base pay on paychecks and break it out 
from overtime and commissions? Also, just two months ago we were told -- again, 
not in writing -- that we could no longer receive overtime but would have to 
take it in compensatory time. Is that legal? 
</P>
<P>
 -- P.D., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Your question raises a number of issues: 1) Wage and hour laws require 
overtime pay for any hours worked in excess of 40 per week, and an employer 
generally may not require an employee to accept compensatory time in place of 
overtime pay. In certain situations, however, an employee may request 
compensatory time. 2) While employers who pay hourly wages must provide 
employees with the total hours worked, I am not aware of any legal requirement 
that a paycheck break out overtime and commissions from base pay. 3) Absent a 
specific agreement, a promised pay raise is probably not enforceable.

 Question: I was recently laid off from my job as a building and equipment 
mechanic at McDonnell Douglas. Before I was let go, I applied for two openings 
for the same job classification at the company's plant in Long Beach. Despite 
15 years' experience with the company, the jobs went to two other people -- 
including a former co-worker with less experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I really think I was not hired for those jobs because I have a reputation as a 
whistle-blower who has filed numerous grievances about work being removed from 
our job classification. And though I'd like to think this has nothing to do 
with it, I'm African American and the two men hired were white. 
</P>
<P>
 My former union says it's not a union matter, so I have to pursue it on my 
own. Do I have a case regarding discrimination in hiring? 
</P>
<P>
 -- E.T., Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Whistle-blower protection laws apply in cases where the employee 
reports an employer's violation of state or federal law. This generally occurs 
in cases where an employer breaches a government contract or knowingly 
manufactures a product in violation of government standards. For the most part, 
an employee is not entitled to whistle-blowing protection when he reports an 
employer's violation of an employment contract or collective bargaining 
agreement. Instead, the proper recourse for your claim may be an action for 
breach of contract or filing an unfair labor practice charge with the National 
Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
 A race discrimination claim requires some proof your employer relied on your 
race as a determining factor in denying you the position. Your initial burden 
is to show that you are a member of a racial minority, you applied and were 
qualified for the position, you were denied the position, and the position 
remained open or was given to another person not of your race. 
</P>
<P>
 An employer can successfully rebut your case by showing it had a legitimate 
business reason to deny you the position, such as you were not qualified or the 
selected candidate was more qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, you should contact the California Department of Fair Employment 
and Housing and/or the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to 
determine if you should file a race discrimination claim.

 Question: Eighteen months ago, I was offered and accepted a wonderful job as 
general manager of a nonprofit trade association representing an industry I had 
worked in for 35 years. I report to a board of directors consisting of 
volunteers from various phases of the industry. They are unpaid and serve for 
two or three years as "trustees." On July 1 of this year, a new president of 
the board began a one-year term. On July 12, he began a quiet campaign to 
persuade me to retain the services of his son, a CPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, he wants me to switch our account from the accounting firm that 
has done our work very satisfactorily for five years to his son's firm. I am 
not inclined to do it for many good reasons but primarily because I am quite 
sure the membership at large would not approve of it and I would take the heavy 
hit if I did it. 
</P>
<P>
 I am reluctant to put the issue before the board because it would embarrass 
him or he would deny having made the request. I had hoped the issue would "go 
away of its own weight," but it hasn't. What does the law say about this kind 
of situation? Do I have any legal recourse or possible support from the state 
Labor Department? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You probably have no recourse from any state agency. There is no 
statute or case law that addresses conflicts of interest of the nature that you 
have described. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is possible that the president's actions violate the by-laws of 
your organization. If they do, you could point that out to him, and perhaps he 
would back off. If he does not, however, I see no recourse other than raising 
the issue somehow with the full board or, if there is one, the executive 
committee of the board.

O.C. JAZZ REVIEW; STILL FLYING TO MOON; TONY BENNETT BRINGS HIS IN-PERSON MAGIC 
TO CERRITOS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there anyone who's seen just a little too much of Tony Bennett this year? 
It seems the singer has made appearances on almost every music awards show you 
can think of, while his recent albums continue to hang near the top of the jazz 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
 He sang in May to a crowd of 6,000 members of the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons at the Anaheim Convention Center -- about the same time that he could 
be seen crooning with Elvis Costello and k.d. lang on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one could have enjoyed him Saturday night without attending his 
concert at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts (where he also sang 
Friday) as KCET-TV simultaneously was carrying his special, "Tony Bennett Live: 
Watch What Happens." So why bother to get off the couch? 
</P>
<P>
 Simple reason: No matter how engaging he may be on the TV screen, the strength 
of Bennett's singing and the enthusiasm he carries for his music gain almost 
magical proportions when he is heard in person. 
</P>
<P>
 His show here varied only slightly from those other recent performances, right 
down to the same between-song gags he's been pulling for the last few years (he 
announces that the Japanese have a new national anthem, and then says that 
instead of singing "I'll Take Manhattan," he'll do "We'll Sell Manhattan"). But 
we don't go to Tony Bennett concerts to hear him sing new material. We go to 
hear "Fly Me to the Moon," "San Francisco" and "The Man I Love." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite its predictability, Saturday's show was one of his best in recent 
memory. His voice was in particularly fine shape and he was especially playful 
in his rhythmic delivery. His sustained tones did not wander off key as they 
had in Anaheim, and he seemed to have the wind of a long distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, during the instrumental break in an up-tempo version of Duke 
Ellington's "Caravan," he did run in place, dancing at a furious pace while 
swinging to and fro to face all sides of the house. Despite the vigorous 
workout, Bennett -- hardly looking winded -- gave the tune his customary 
big-time ending. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most significant difference this time, though, was his willingness 
to close tunes in understated style, instead of ending them all in the strong, 
sustained way that has been one of his trademarks. His tones were unusually 
soft during "A Foggy Day in London Town," and he worked quietly against bassist 
Douglas Richardson's walk on "Just a Lucky So-and-So." As usual, he sang a pair 
of tunes without amplification, sending his voice to the rafters, modestly 
crediting the room and its architect for the feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Another good reason to catch Bennett live is his supporting trio, led by 
pianist Ralph Sharon. The visual excitement of drummer Clayton Cameron juggling 
his brushes while doing a double-time on a single snare (as he did Bennett's 
MTV "Unplugged" special) is heightened in person, while the sound of 
Richardson's bass is decidedly stronger and more woody. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Bennett gives each of these musicians his due, applauding the 
work right along with the audience. He often works as a cheerleader, not only 
for the guys in the band but for his own performances, cuing the audience's 
applause with sweeping arm gestures and wiggles of his fingers that seem to say 
"give it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also seeks applause for the composers and lyricists, both living and 
dead, whose material he has embraced for some 40 years. Seeing Tony Bennett is 
an education in what he calls "The Great American Songbook," the music of Cole 
Porter, the Gershwins, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern and others, including 
contemporary artists including Charles DeForest, from whom he has taken his 
showstopper, "When Do the Bells Ring for Me." 
</P>
<P>
 And that may be his biggest contribution to the popular song, a form once 
endangered by rock and its various offshoots: He carries it to a new generation 
while making it breathe with life. As the old song goes, Tony Bennett "is here 
to stay."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JEFFREY GAINES, PAULA COLE: A PASSION PLAY IN 2 ACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Passion is no ordinary word, to quote Graham Parker. At the Jeffrey 
Gaines/Paula Cole double feature at the Coach House Friday night, passion was 
enough to raise the level of the young East Coast singer-songwriters' 
performances far above the level of their songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines, 28, has two albums to his credit and Cole, 26, is a newcomer with one 
release. They aren't songwriting slouches: Both offer material that is 
intelligent, deeply felt and melodically attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 But they nevertheless reflect the general slippage of songsmithing in an era 
when video is triumphant and text is in retreat. The result is a bluntness of 
expression, a rush to make an emotional point, that precludes experimentation 
with the sound of words, with imagery, and with methods of poetic indirection. 
Gaines and Cole are good enough to write songs with themes and situations and 
core feelings that make an impression; neither thus far has generated verses 
that stick in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bob Dylan of "My Back Pages" trusted his listeners to derive meaning from 
an enigmatic but evocative refrain: "But I was so much older than, I'm younger 
than that now." If Gaines or Cole were to write a song with the same lyrical 
thrust as Dylan's, which voiced deep reservations about the enterprise of 
political songwriting, they probably would give us rhyming position papers 
rather than Dylan's strands of oblique verse rich in implication. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it wouldn't hurt if each did write such a position paper and stuck 
to it. When it comes to social commentary, Cole and the somewhat more able 
Gaines are about as subtle as a paid political advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 But reservations like those, based on the singers' recorded work, were swept 
aside in the absorbing rush of two impassioned performances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, who opened, was a commanding presence, looking like a sexy St. Joan in 
cropped dark hair and a simple, clingy, sheath-like dress. 
</P>
<P>
 She clearly aimed to make the grand gesture with her kinetic delivery (at 
times she seemed to be urging herself on as she swung her free right hand as if 
it were a jockey's whip) and she backed that intention with a rich, unstinting 
voice, summoning Toni Childs-like muscle in her middle range and a breathy, 
delicate, Joni Mitchell-ish quality at the top. Her dark, plaintive songs about 
stunted lives became short dramas that completely swept up the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, who mainly just sang, was backed by a guitarist and percussionist who 
brought a tonal and rhythmic charge to the more aggressive songs in the 
45-minute set.

 "Suwannee Joe," an unrecorded song, is a sultry, bluesy rocker. Gerry Leonard 
applied the grit with acoustic slide guitar bolstered by fuzztone distortion 
while Cole sashayed suggestively and laid on dusky embellishments with a 
clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
 She and percussionist Eric Gabow powered her feminist lament "Watch the 
Woman's Hands" with intense, syncopated hand-claps; Gabow was so caught up in 
the performance that he looked like a transported supplicant at a charismatic 
Christian prayer meeting. Touches like these gave Cole far more impact live 
than she musters with the full-band arrangements of her album, "Harbinger." 
Even "Hitler's Brothers," an indictment of bigotry burdened by obvious, 
threadbare writing, came across with persuasive thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching to folkier modes, the Massachusetts-based Cole recalled splendid 
fellow-New Englander Cheryl Wheeler as she delivered the swelling melody and 
full-hearted, lovelorn lament of her most attractive song, "I Am So Ordinary." 
With "Bethlehem," she put her own spin on the high-school alienation theme of 
Janis Ian's "At Seventeen," resorting to a wistful tone that called to mind 
Shawn Colvin. 
</P>
<P>
 For an encore, she highlighted her taste for big-scale drama with a version of 
Dolly Parton's "Jolene" that featured a human beat box routine drawn from the 
rap lexicon, and heavy rhythmic breathing straight out of the Beatles' "Lovely 
Rita." Between songs, she was able to step out of her intense-diva persona for 
humorous, down-to-earth patter. Many in the small audience of about 100 
probably weren't familiar with her, but were thoroughly smitten with what they 
saw and heard and sent her off with two standing ovations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines, playing solo-acoustic, walked on stage with an amiable observation 
about his touring partner: "Paula Cole was amazing. To be honest, I don't know 
where the hell I'm gonna take you from there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But, far from the nervous confession of a headliner fearful of being upstaged, 
this was the first gambit in a winning game plan. Personable and completely at 
ease, the Philadelphia-based Gaines took the audience into his confidence and 
disarmed it simply by saying what was on his mind from moment to moment as the 
show progressed. His running observations on his songs, on his wandering 
thoughts, and on the methods and strategies of concertizing turned into one of 
the most engaging color commentaries heard since Dandy Don Meredith left the 
broadcast booth of "Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a touch of egocentricity in Gaines' discourses about his 
life-and-times and the enterprise at hand. But it was more than offset by his 
emphasis on the "we"-ness of performance: It was pretty clear that he wasn't so 
much trumpeting himself as trying to establish a sense of a 
concert-as-shared-experience between artist and listeners, in which both sides 
would benefit from a friendly insider's instant analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 His strategy paid off in tangible ways that heightened the music. After a long 
opening sequence of ballads, Gaines -- whose current album, "Somewhat Slightly 
Dazed," tries to position him as more of a rocker than the introspective 
troubadour on his 1992 debut -- broke into a brisk, semi-funk strum. But he 
soon stopped, expressing doubts whether anything that assertive could work in 
the solo context. Fans urged him to continue with the song, "Nursery Rhyme," 
and weighed in with keep-the-beat hand claps and whooping that gave the moment 
just the kind of energy the much-pleased Gaines had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't just talk -- in fact, in a time-tested solo-folkie strategy for 
pacing a concert, after establishing a firm connection early on with his chat, 
he cut back during the second half and embarked on an uninterrupted string of 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 His singing was firm, richly grained and soulful, its hues recalling John 
Lennon or a huskier, deeper-voiced Elton John. This sincere, fervent cast was 
well-suited to songs that often address the insecurities and fears that can 
disrupt relationships, or stop people from pursuing their own free paths in 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was telling that he encored with a passionate version of Peter Gabriel's 
"In Your Eyes," which explores the process of overcoming such hurdles. Gaines 
sang everything with impressive conviction, and the way he swayed, bent his 
lanky frame or jumped in place when songs hit an emotional peak gave physical 
evidence that he was tapping into powerful feelings, and drawing strength and 
pleasure from the very act of pouring them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Sameness was the chief obstacle in the nearly two-hour performance. Gaines' 
emphatic but simply-strummed guitar accompaniments didn't offer much variety or 
counterpoint to his singing, and the material fell into a repetitive range of 
slow and medium tempos. The melodies all were attractive, but not distinctive 
enough to really stick in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a mighty voice, unflagging commitment and uncommon willingness to 
treat listeners as his confidantes and confederates allowed him to put on a 
more involving show than some superior but less impassioned singer-songwriters 
could have delivered.

 Here's good news about the script of "Goldeneye," Pierce Brosnan's coming 
debut as James Bond. It will not be politically correct! 
</P>
<P>
 This means -- among other things -- plenty of surgically enhanced lovelies who 
want to kill 007 or bed him. Or both. (I see "The Girls of Goldeneye" in a 
future edition of Playboy!) 
</P>
<P>
 The film's two bad guys are Sean Bean (you might remember his well-muscled 
anatomy from "Lady Chatterley's Lover") and Robbie Coltrane (A&E's "Cracker"). 
Robbie plays the head of the Russian Mafia.

 Sophia Loren agreed to do only one magazine interview promoting her appearance 
in Robert Altman's "Ready to Wear" ("Pret-a-Porter"). And that magazine is the 
delicious Detour. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't miss Sophia on the cover, photographed by Greg Gorman. Her 
cheekbones, lips and incredible cleavage are apparently indestructible! 
</P>
<P>
 Altman certainly thought so. He persuaded Sophia to re-create her famous 
striptease from "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow" for his movie. 
</P>
<P>
 When writer Jim Turner asks Sophia how it feels to be 60, Loren replies 
cheerfully, "I am not 60. I am three times 20!" The enduring star adds that 
"inside, I am still 12 years old."

 'Tis the Season for 'Santa Clause': "The Santa Clause" is going to town. The 
Disney movie featuring sitcom star Tim Allen was No. 1 at the box office for 
the second weekend in a row, according to early industry estimates. The film, 
in its fourth week of release, took in a moderate $11.5 million during the 
weekend and appeared likely to hit $100 million in total gross by late this 
week. There was a sharp drop to second place during a typically slow time at 
the box office between Thanksgiving and the Christmas moviegoing rush: 
Paramount's "Star Trek: Generations" took in $5.5 million. Universal's "Junior" 
and Warner Bros.' "Interview With the Vampire" earned $5.35 million and $5.3 
million, respectively, for third and fourth. And in fifth place was Disney's "A 
Low Down Dirty Shame" with $4.9 million. "Trapped in Paradise," the 20th 
Century Fox film starring Dana Carvey, Nicolas Cage and Jon Lovitz, had a 
disappointing opening with $2.8 million for seventh place. STAGE

six-page letter is addressed to the McCartneys and urges Linda to "get off your 
high horse." It appears to be in response to her criticism of remarks that 
Lennon made about the Fab Four in an interview. Other big-ticket items at the 
auction included a Martin acoustic guitar that Elvis Presley used during the 
last months of his life, which sold for $54,625. Seven hours of taped telephone 
conversations between reclusive actress Greta Garbo and her friend Raymond Daum 
sold for $43,125. QUICK TAKES

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; WARMTH, VIRTUOSITY FROM MORCA TROUPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beckman Auditorium at Caltech is not kind to flamenco dancers: A low stage and 
shallow rake prevent most everyone from having a clear view of flashing feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it has the advantage of intimacy, and on Saturday night the four members 
of Morca Dance Theatre created a warm flamenco cafe mood, with all the 
spontaneous virtuosity and vibrant personality shifts that image evokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Bellingham, Wash., husband-and-wife company co-directors Teodoro and 
Isabel Morca are veteran dancers whose skill extends to programming.  
</P>
<P>
 In the first act, everyone had a light touch, from Isabel's swiftly fluttering 
arms and Teodoro's graceful tattoo of tapping feet, to the stunningly soft, 
smooth voice of Oscar Nieto and Gerardo Alcala's gentle persuasion of the 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Teodoro Morca excels at this light "chico" style, although the second half of 
the program proved he could stamp out fire with the best of them. However, the 
elegant breeziness of his early solos left the afterglow. 
</P>
<P>
 Morca also has an impish comedic side, which got full play in "El Zapatero y 
las Botas Magicas," a little "Red Shoes" number in which he's a cobbler 
controlled by magic boots. It's also reminiscent of Astaire's "I've got shoes 
with wings on" number -- in Morca's case, an appropriate association. JENNIFER

OPERA; S.F. 'LUCIA': HIGH NOTES, LOW SURREALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Lucia di Lammermoor" used to be a simple opera in which Donizetti used the 
skeleton of a novel by Sir Walter Scott essentially as an excuse for a fine 
vocal circus. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the quintessential concert in costume. No one paid much attention to 
the bloody drama. Everyone came to savor the soaring love music, the zonking 
sextet, the tenor's pretty death scene and, above all, the extended high-wire 
act in which the virtuosic soprano daintily went bonkers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it was in San Francisco with Lily Pons (for 11 seasons between 
1932 and 1950), Joan Sutherland (1961) and Beverly Sills (1972). That's the way 
it was with numerous coloratura-diva wanna-bes before, between and after. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent seasons, however, "Lucia" has been usurped as a vehicle for the 
stage director and/or designer. Francesca Zambello transformed the innocent 
opus into a symbolist nightmare at the Met, and Andrei Serban took comparable 
liberties when he brought his own vision of a romanticism in decay to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, San Francisco is mucking about with poor "Lucia" too. Gerard Howland, the 
overworked and under-budgeted designer for all reasons at the War Memorial 
Opera House, has come up with a cheap -- also ugly and impractical -- unit set 
that sets all perspectives askew. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, pretension. Ah, obfuscation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucia's world is defined by a castle that has been turned on its side. 
Ravenswood is shown from the bottom up, as if the viewer were lying on the 
floor and gazing at the ceiling or the sky (via clumsily projected backdrops). 
</P>
<P>
 The concept leaves no room for development. The distortion is there from the 
start. More disturbing, the concept, as instituted here, necessitates some 
jarring contradictions. Props that stand straight do so at now-illogical 
angles, and characters who move normally look as if they are literally climbing 
the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the decorative superficiality of Howland's other designs this season, 
one should at least be grateful for the definition of a scenic concept -- any 
scenic concept. Unfortunately, the result in this case is neither useful nor 
theatrical, and it finds no resonance in the stage action. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Bernhard, the conscientious traffic-cop on duty, simply ignores the set 
and its bad-dream conceit. She moves the cast around the playing area as if 
this were just another stock "Lucia" in Messina back in 1926. For better or 
worse, this director lacks the designer's modernist convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Toms' costumes were actually lifted from an old-fashioned production 
first seen here 22 years ago. Enough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances one had to be grateful for small musical favors. The 
key word, alas, is small. Nello Santi conducted with his usual competence -- 
that is, the dull, leisurely, cumbersome competence of a longstanding 
routinier. His most important achievement probably was restoration of the 
wrongly maligned Wolf Crag scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast, though hardly inspired, tried valiantly on Friday to surmount the 
obvious obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Ann Swenson, remembered for her blonde and bland Lucia in Costa Mesa last 
season, sang with enough stratospheric bravado, enough agility, enough lyricism 
and purity to win the thunderous ovations that come with the bel-canto 
territory. She seldom ventured beyond physical and vocal cliches, however, in 
defining the heroine's plight. Her climactic E-flats emerged wiry, and her 
phrasing tended to droop a la Sutherland. Perhaps with stronger leadership. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Marcello Giordani partnered her as -- surprise -- a tall, dark and dashing 
Edgardo. His lovely, slender tenor is growing with the passage of time, and it 
has taken on something of a metallic edge. On this occasion he sometimes 
sacrificed lyric suavity for dynamic thrust. Still, he was always ardent, 
always precise and always stylish. Within the dreary musical and dramatic 
context, that meant a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Servile introduced a grainy baritone and a blustery manner as nasty 
Enrico. Alastair Miles' gentle basso and histrionic restraint could do little 
to enliven the clerical platitudes of old Raimondo. The others faded into the 
silly scenery.

SCREENING ROOM: 'JO-JO,' 'GROUND ZERO': TWO FIRST FILMS AT FILMFORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Filmforum is presenting tonight at the Hollywood Moguls, 1650 Schrader Blvd. 
(formerly Hudson Ave.), two powerful and distinctive first films: Britta 
Sjogren's "Jo-Jo at the Gate of Lions" (at 7:30) and Craig Schlattman's "At 
Ground Zero" (at 9:30). The first is an eloquent, understated portrait of an 
attractive, engaging young woman (Lorie Morino) whose apparent hearing of 
voices increasingly governs every aspect of her life, complicating her 
relationship with the likable, understandably puzzled young man (Chris Shearer) 
who is falling in love with her.  
</P>
<P>
 What makes the film unusual is the force of its crisp, succinct images, 
heightened by exceptional performances in well-written roles. Sjogren had a 
tremendous assist from the makers of the delightful "A Little Stiff," Greg 
Watkins (who was "Jo-Jo's" superb cinematographer) and Caveh Zahedi (who 
handled the sound). Morino and the lanky Shearer are most impressive, as is 
David Schultz, who plays a slick guy, also in pursuit of Morino. 
</P>
<P>
 Less demanding but just as impressive, "At Ground Zero" is a raw, edgy tale, 
shot through with dark humor, about a couple of young druggies (well-acted by 
Tom Elliott and Aysha Hauer) and their reckless adventures on the road from the 
West Coast to Minneapolis. Schlattman, who also stars as a sniggering, weaselly 
type who gives the couple a ride, directs with terrific wit and immediacy. 
There's also a winning portrayal by Brian Brophy as a singularly ineffectual 
would-be suicide who joins the duo for a spell. Separate admissions; (213) 
466-4143. 
</P>
<P>
 German Road Picture: The Goethe Institute, 5700 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 110, 
continues its German Comedy: East Meets West series Tuesday at 7 p.m. with 
Detlev Buck's slight but sweet-natured "No More Mr. Nice Guy" (1993). Joachim 
Krol stars as Rudi Kipp, a diminutive, wistful innocent, granted a temporary 
release from a mental institution in western Germany, to join his burly brother 
Moritz (Horst Krause) on a trip to former East Germany to claim their late 
grandmother's estate.  
</P>
<P>
 This Mutt-and-Jeff duo, soon joined by a good-looking Soviet army deserter 
(Konstantin Kotljarov), become caught up in a series of dryly amusing mishaps. 
Along for the ride, much later on, is striking, witty Sophie Rols as a shrewd, 
redheaded waitress. The film can be taken as wry comment on life in reunified 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Vadim Glowna's intimate, insightful "Rising to the Bait" (1992), which screens 
at the Institute Thursday at 7 p.m., is a highly complex, serious comedy 
centering on an implacable agent of MAD, West Germany's CIA, attempting to grab 
the property of a matronly woman (Elsa Grube-Deister), an idyllic site along 
the Baltic but also adjacent to a military base still under Soviet control. 
Grube-Deister, in a warm, commanding portrayal, comes across as the ultimate 
clever peasant quick to get the hang of free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Working from Knut Boeser's script, Glowna touches upon many thorny issues of 
reunification: the plight of those with a Stasi past, that of a young woman 
left in the East by her parents in their escape to the West, and above all a 
paranoid mind-set left over from a divided Germany. Glowna, who is also a 
well-known international film actor, even manages to work in a delightful love 
story. Preceded by "Two to One" (1991), Rita Kalbe's clever three-minute 
celebration of reunification.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: AT 72, SHE'S NOW A DRIVING FORCE IN STAND-UP COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Betty Perry is the Valley's answer to Milton Berle. 
</P>
<P>
 She's never heard a joke she didn't want to steal. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, who lives in Encino, is, according to her business card, an 
actress-comedian-writer-producer-tank driver, although her tank driving days 
are now over. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas many people work their way through college, Perry, who's 72, says 
she's working her way through old age doing comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why she has chosen comedy, she says because she doesn't know how to 
type. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also, however, a natural healer, a spiritualist and the subject of much 
interest by the psychological community. "I may not have been a centerfold in a 
girlie magazine, but I have had a picture of my naked hand produced in the 
magazine Beyond Reality," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is fascinated by the pictures taken of me using Kirlian 
photography," Perry explains. Kirlian photography purports to show energy 
fields emanating from the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who wouldn't know a Kirlian photograph from a potato chip can see 
the energy field emanating from Perry. No special photography needed. This is a 
woman who keeps a manager, commercial agent, acting agent and print agent busy, 
keeping her busy and in work. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she has also written a book and has done about 100 other odd jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Modesty probably prevented her from mentioning that she sky-dives when things 
get dull. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about Perry's early years on a farm in western Illinois 
because that's the way she likes it. When asked about it, she sputters in 
exasperation: "It's too boring. I don't want to go into that." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry says her life really started when she was in her 60s and she first did 
stand-up comedy in a hotel just outside Denver. Asked how she got her start in 
comedy, she says she put together some material and got up on the nearest 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why she would want to tackle a job as hard as stand-up, she answers, 
"because I'm funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course. 
</P>
<P>
 What could we have been thinking of? 
</P>
<P>
 Another topic that bores her is her marriage to a military man and their 
different postings around the world with three children. Except when it comes 
to one of her favorite stories about driving a tank: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working at a military installation in Tacoma issuing parts for combat 
equipment, when one of the men asked if I'd like to go for a tank ride," she 
remembers. She agreed, then agreed again when he asked her if she'd like to 
take it herself for a little test drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got in a lot of hot water for that," she says, adding that when called on 
the carpet by his superiors, he said she was the only person he ever took for a 
test drive who didn't need driving instructions. "It was just like driving the 
Caterpillar I used to wheel around the farm," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry says she has given up her short career in tank driving to concentrate on 
comedy. "And a lot of my comedy's none too clean," she adds with a satisfied 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why she left Denver for Los Angeles, she says because this is where 
all the action is. 
</P>
<P>
 Show business is now her life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is suggested to her that 60-something may not have been the optimum age to 
get her break in Hollywood. She says, well, it is true she hasn't done a lot of 
acting yet, but the commercials have come through. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first commercial was for a bank, and at the audition she was asked to 
improvise a couple of lines. The scene was that she was supposed to be in bed 
on her birthday when her husband brings her breakfast. She was told to take it 
from there. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the first thing that came into her head was, "Oh, I'm so happy you 
remembered to crack the eggs this year before you scrambled them." Not a 
world-beater, but the patter was snappy enough to get her that job, and others 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 She has appeared in commercials for Nestle's tollhouse cookies, Mr. Coffee, 
the Dreyfus Fund and Little Caesar's. The pizza ad ran in early 1993 and was 
set in a psychiatrist's office during the wedding of two dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she also won $3,459 as a contestant on America's Funniest People, 
before that TV show was booted off the airwaves, and that she's won other 
awards and contests in clubs all over Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for the key to success in this field, she says, "I remember every joke I 
ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I don't do is sit around listening to my hair grow," Perry says. "As I 
told a man at Universal who was interested in making a video with me, not all 
old people just drool on themselves, have memory loss and pass gas." 
</P>
<P>
 She is currently up for a couple of commercials and is now planning her next 
stand-up appearance at the Calabasas Community Cabaret, Dec. 16 and 17 at 8 
p.m. at Calabasas High School. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she will be doing about five minutes of clean stuff. Then adds, "For 
me that's a stretch." Making Room for Baby, Even When Face Down 
</P>
<P>
 When Judy Leyton of Van Nuys was pregnant with twins eight years ago, the idea 
of sleeping on her stomach was only a dream that she's since figured out how to 
make a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 What she's come up with is a 4-foot-long foam pillow with a depression in the 
middle that she says lets pregnant moms sleep on their tummies through the 
ninth month. 
</P>
<P>
 When the baby is delivered and mom no longer needs the pillow, voila , and it 
becomes a neat and cozy little baby's bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I had the twins, I became a massage therapist and had a lot of pregnant 
women as patients. They have found massage a good way to lessen upper and lower 
back pains, but it was awkward working on them because they had to lie on their 
side," Leyton says. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyton gave the matter a lot of thought and consulted with her husband, David. 
The pair came up with a drawing of the pillow, had a prototype made and got a 
firm to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, they started a mail-order business for the pillows, which sell for 
$159 and $199, depending on whether they are ordered in cotton or vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyton says the response to Prego Pillow has been good with the medical 
professions and with individual mothers-to-be. She says that, in addition to 
being pleased that she and her husband have created a business together, it 
makes her feel good when she sends each order out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish it had been around when I was carrying Casey and Cory," Leyton 
says. "I was huge." Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that they've discovered the gene that causes fatness in human beings and 
obesity may go the way of whooping cough and measles, I'm going to put my 
customers into anything that makes chocolate anything."

O.C. ENTERPRISE: DRAWING NEW CUSTOMERS; TECHNOLOGY: EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE COULD 
OPEN ADDITIONAL MARKETS FOR TUSTIN-BASED PUBLISHER OF HOW-TO ART BOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ross Sarracino quit drawing when he was 11 because it was not much fun and he 
got wrapped up in sports. The president of Walter Foster Publishing, a maker of 
instructional art books, knows palpably why he has few teen-age customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walter Foster is now getting into educational software -- and that could 
open up new markets for the 74-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Foster's how-to-draw books provided the contents for Dabbler, a 
software program that enables users to sketch and paint on the computer, using 
a mouse or a stylus. Developed by Fractal Design in Northern California, under 
a licensing agreement with Walter Foster, Dabbler hit computer stores last 
spring. And early next year, the publisher's book on animation will be the 
basis for a CD-ROM to be marketed by Motionworks of Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to grow in the future, we need to move into this type of technology," 
says Sarracino, adding that his company is teaming up with other multimedia 
enterprises to convert even more of its 161 titles for software use. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarracino would be happy to get a tiny piece of the booming educational 
software pie. With millions of children now having access to computers at home, 
analysts say, sales of such products for home use will approach $500 million 
this year -- nearly double that of 1993 and roughly the same as the total 
market for the art supply industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of the century, there will be phenomenal growth," says Seth 
Feinstein, an analyst at Crowell, Weedon & Co., an investment banking firm in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is even more potential at schools, which are already spending more 
of their textbook dollars for software. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the future, rather than young children picking up crayons and 
watercolors, they're going to sit in front of the terminal to get their 
introduction in art," says Brenda Lugannani, who buys art materials for 
Michaels Stores, the nation's largest art and craft shop chain. "We have to 
prepare for that future." 
</P>
<P>
 At Walter Foster, Sarracino does not see sales of software eclipsing sales of 
its printed books any time soon. The private firm, which has annual revenue of 
about $6 million, does not have the wherewithal to develop multimedia products 
on its own or get into them in a big way. Nor does it want to. 
</P>
<P>
 But income from licensing fees and other multimedia joint ventures could 
provide a big lift to Walter Foster as it heads into its 75th year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, founded in 1921 by hog-medicine salesman Walter Foster, has 
become the nation's leading publisher of how-to art books and is known to 
artists and cartoonists worldwide. But in the past decade, the company has 
struggled in a declining industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of its key markets are children and older adults, mainly homemakers who 
take up art as a hobby. But more women are working today than in past 
generations, and financially strapped schools have cut back on art funding. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Walter Foster's sales were down to less than $3 million in 1988 
when Sarracino, a former Price Waterhouse accountant, and other investors 
bought Walter Foster from the founder's grandson, Lyle Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the publisher has refurbished old titles and added dozens of new 
ones, including a children's line with books such as "How to Draw Lion King," 
which Walter Foster put out under a licensing agreement with Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Foster also recently introduced how-to kits that include its 
step-by-step drawing books, sketching paper and drawing pencils -- and they are 
selling not in dusty mom-and-pop art shops but in upscale stores that cater to 
baby boomers and their kids, such as Learning Smith and Natural Wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The party we'd like to crash are young people," says Paul Hegness, a Newport 
Beach attorney who is one of Walter Foster's four directors. The others are 
Sarracino, Andrew McNally IV of the Rand McNally map-making family in Chicago 
and Illinois businessman Rhett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 McNally had eyed Walter Foster earlier for possible investment, Hegness says, 
so one day in 1988 Hegness "cold-called" him, and McNally sent a $25,000 check 
via overnight mail as a deposit on Walter Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Hegness, a longtime neighbor of Sarracino in Irvine's Turtle Rock area, says 
that he invested in Walter Foster because of its reputation and broad 
distribution channel. Walter Foster's products are in about 15,000 mass-market 
and specialized stores globally, and its name is virtually synonymous with 
how-to art books. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I thought about what I would use for the contents for the Dabbler, I 
immediately thought of Walter Foster," says Steve Manousos, vice president of 
sales at Fractal Design. "When I was a kid, I used Walter Foster." 
</P>
<P>
 Manousos says that Dabbler, which retails for about $65, has been selling at a 
rate of several thousand a month. Manousos declined to say what Fractal pays 
Walter Foster, but it figures to be significant because Dabbler comes with a 
manual that is largely a reprint of Walter Foster's how-to-draw books and a 
separate Walter Foster instruction book on the use of colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dabbler is sold by computer retailers such as Egghead and Comp U.S.A. But it 
will be at least a year before such software programs appear in key Walter 
Foster distribution points, which are not sure that traditional art customers 
are ready just yet to enter the computer age. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to watch what goes on," says Lugannani, the buyer for Michaels, 
which has 372 stores and carries Walter Foster's books and kits. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the long run, Lugannani and others believe, computer software will be 
as important to fine art as it is now to graphic design. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Wenrick, senior buyer for Aaron Brothers Art Marts, says that she just 
finished a test of Dabbler at the company's store in Brea. "Some customers were 
very excited," she says, but others were intimidated by something so different 
from canvasses and paint. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Wenrick says, art-related software will be available at some of 
Aaron Brothers' 70 stores next year. "We're going to go real slow with it," she 
says.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: INTEREST RATES -- THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Short- and long-term interest rates suddenly are diverging in dramatic 
fashion, presenting investors with a virtual embarrassment of riches. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, a renewed jump in short rates is making money market funds, 
Treasury bills and bank CDs more appealing than at any time since early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, long-term bond yields have begun to tumble, ending -- at 
least temporarily -- the erosion of bond holders' principal, and forcing some 
investors to consider whether it's time to lock in long-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The fixed-income markets' split personality has been developing for the past 
two weeks, but it may have become apparent to many investors only on Friday, 
after the government released the November employment report. 
</P>
<P>
 News that the economy created 350,000 new jobs in November -- far above most 
experts' estimates -- sent short-term interest rates rocketing on the 
assumption that the Federal Reserve Board will have to raise short rates yet 
again to restrain the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on one-year Treasury bills leaped from 6.93% on Thursday to 6.99% on 
Friday, the highest in nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
 As a measure of how quickly that yield has risen just in the last few weeks, 
consider that a buyer of a one-year T-bill on Nov. 22 got a yield of 6.58%, or 
0.41-point less than Friday's yield. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, longer-term bond yields had the opposite response to Friday's 
employment report. Despite the clear indications of economic strength and the 
implied probability of another Fed hike in short-term rates in the near future, 
long rates actually fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds slumped to 7.90% Friday from 8.01% 
Thursday, and now is well below its recent peak of 8.13% reached Nov. 17. The 
five-year T-note yield fell to 7.71% Friday from 7.81% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As most bond investors are painfully aware, long-term yields had been rising 
almost nonstop in tandem with short yields this year as the Federal Reserve 
tightened credit six times -- most recently on Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 So why are long yields now declining, even in the face of continued robust 
economic growth? 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Streeters pointed Friday to elements of the November employment 
report that suggest there still isn't much upward pressure on wages -- and thus 
inflation remains under control -- despite the economy's boom. 
</P>
<P>
 A big increase in wages, so the theory goes, would guarantee a new upward 
spiral in prices of goods and services, simply because consumers would have 
more to spend and thus would be willing to pay more for what they really 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the unemployment rate drops and workers become harder to find in 
some areas of the country, employers overall aren't raising wages much. Wage 
inflation has been running between 2.5% and 3%, annualized, for most of this 
year, not much above the increase in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 All year, one argument used by the bond market to justify higher long yields 
was that higher inflation was "just around the corner," ready to erode the 
returns of anyone dumb enough to lock up money for any length of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the most optimistic economists believe that the market is in the midst of 
a St. Paul-like conversion about inflation -- i.e., that investors see the 
light, and understand that high inflation isn't coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 That mind-set was reinforced last week as investors dumped gold and silver, 
sending the metals' prices plummeting, in an apparent rejection of the need to 
hold an inflation "hedge" anymore. Gold's price sank $9.10 for the week, to 
$375.50 an ounce by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the rally in long-term bonds continues early this week, it could well 
become powerful enough to drive the 30-year T-bond yield down to 7.5% by year's 
end, some Wall Streeters say. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the bond market is probably overdue for a rally, and with 
year-end portfolio adjustments in full swing among both institutional and 
individual investors, fear of missing the boat on a substantial decline in long 
yields may quickly overtake the market. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors tempted to suddenly bet the farm on long-term bonds ought to 
remember that yields on short-term investments are lucrative and getting more 
so, because Wall Street assumes the Fed will continue to boost short rates well 
into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if this economic and interest-rate cycle plays out normally, at some 
point next year short yields -- such as on 3-month T-bills, now paying 5.8% -- 
will equal or even exceed long yields, such as on 30-year T-bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what typically happens at the end of economic booms, as the Fed keeps 
driving short rates up while the bond market begins to look ahead to the next 
recession, lower inflation and lower long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the economy's strength, many investment pros say the best strategy is to 
keep a healthy amount of cash in short-term accounts such as money funds, 
reaping the benefit of rising short yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Many pros also say investors should be patient in committing new money to 
long-term bonds: While yields are admittedly attractive, historically speaking, 
the bond market remains vulnerable to renewed selling. Chances are that 
long-term yields aren't likely to drop as much over the next six months as 
short-term rates are likely to rise, if the economy stays on track.

DISNEY TO GET INTERACTIVE WITH START OF NEW DIVISION; ENTERTAINMENT: THE UNIT 
WILL PUBLISH VIDEO GAMES AND CD-ROM SOFTWARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. is scheduled to formally hop on the interactive bandwagon 
today with the launch of a new division that will publish video games and 
CD-ROM software. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is the last of the major entertainment conglomerates to launch its own 
interactive publishing arm. The move is significant because it represents a 
major commitment to the emerging industry by the company that has been perhaps 
the most skeptical of the so-called digital revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has scheduled a press conference with company Chairman Michael Eisner 
to announce its new efforts. The division will be headed by Steve McBeth, 
executive vice president of Disney Consumer Products, sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit will be dubbed Disney Interactive -- in the tradition of such 
entertainment industry forerunners as Time Warner Interactive, Fox Interactive, 
Universal Interactive and Paramount Interactive. It plans to publish five 
cartridge games and about a dozen CD-ROM titles by next Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago at the "Superhighway Summit" at UCLA, Eisner decried the 
"interactive multimedia" craze and insisted that his was "not a technology 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 But the company began to change course last spring, when Eisner and 
then-Disney Studio Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg showed off the "Lion King" video 
game that the firm had jointly developed with Irvine-based Virgin Interactive. 
Eisner said the technology had advanced to the point where creative input could 
make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Disney's first publishing efforts will be games based on its TV series 
"Gargoyles" and its coming animated film "Pocahontas." 
</P>
<P>
 McBeth will report to Rich Frank, chairman of the firm's Television & 
Telecommunications group, and to Barton Boyd, chief of Consumer Products. The 
goal is to give the new division access to all of the company's resources, 
including theme parks, magazine and book publishing, and film. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every media company in the world is experimenting with the interactive 
format as a potential source of revenue -- though Hollywood's ventures in the 
area have thus far not been overly successful. The number of homes with CD-ROM 
drives expected to reach 10 million by the end of this year, and annual revenue 
for the video game industry is $6 billion, exceeding the figure for annual U.S. 
box-office receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts said, Disney's chances are better than some because of the 
fame of its characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming an extremely crowded market, and margins are very thin," said 
Bruce Ryon, multimedia analyst at Dataquest. "But the thing about the video 
game market is, if you've got good character identification your chances of 
success are much higher. If they leverage those character identities they have 
a pretty good shot."

A NEW MODEL FOR GOVERNMENT-BIG 3 RELATIONS?; CAR SAFETY: THE GM DISPUTE HAD THE 
POTENTIAL TO POISON THE GOODWILL CLINTON HAS NURTURED WITH THE AUTO INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Oct. 18, John F. Smith, chief executive of General Motors Corp., snubbed 
President Clinton by refusing to attend a ceremony celebrating the one-year 
anniversary of the government-industry effort to build a "super car." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: He was upset by Transportation Secretary Federico Pena's "initial" 
decision the day before that GM's C/K 1973-87 pickup trucks had a safety defect 
and should be recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Pena backed away from that earlier finding and signed an 
unprecedented agreement with GM. Under the settlement, the government will drop 
its recall effort and GM will provide $51 million for safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A recall could have cost the nation's No. 1 auto maker more than $1 billion, 
seriously damaged its reputation and resulted in more lawsuits and higher 
settlements in the 50 or more cases already pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a clear win for GM," an industry official in Washington said. "Pena 
backed down." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena, however, portrayed the decision as a victory for the public, arguing 
that GM's money will be used to save more lives immediately than could have 
been accomplished if he just closed the case or pursued a costly and uncertain 
recall in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena also said the decision was his alone. But industry and government sources 
said there almost certainly was pressure from the White House, which had 
received a flood of complaints from Congress and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the safety dispute had the potential to poison the good relations 
Clinton has for the past two years nurtured with the auto industry, which is 
creating the jobs and revenue fueling the economy. And in the wake of strong 
Republican gains in the midterm elections, the White House can ill afford to 
alienate an industry that has backed its health care and trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pena thing cast serious doubts about whether the very-much-improved 
relationship with the Administration would continue," a GM spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of many, Clinton has pursued cooperation over confrontation 
with the auto industry in his first two years in office. Most important, 
industry officials feel they are being heard and understood in Washington for 
the first time in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Big Three and the federal government committed themselves to a 
10-year effort to work together to produce a super car -- an affordable 
non-polluting vehicle that could get up to 80 miles per gallon of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 While the super-car research is going forward, the Administration appears to 
be satisfied to not push for higher fuel-economy standards. The Administration 
is also seeking an industry-backed compromise on electric vehicles in the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto industry is a strong backer of Clinton's ill-fated health care reform 
package. In trade, Detroit was disappointed that recent talks did not produce 
an agreement with Japan on auto and auto parts, but believes that the 
Administration's efforts will result in progress next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are disagreements on some things, none is as controversial as 
the safety dispute between GM and Pena. The industry united on the issue, which 
it believed could create a bad precedent and regulatory turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern was evident at the super-car ceremony as top officials of the Big 
Three talked with Clinton and Vice President Al Gore as they stood on the dais 
before the proceedings began. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were asking what the hell happened," an industry lobbyist said. "The 
President seemed surprised and was apologetic." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute is one of the most complex and emotional to face the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration since its creation in 1966, a year after 
consumer activist Ralph Nader wrote his seminal book "Unsafe at Any Speed." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency began a defect investigation in 1992 after the Center for Auto 
Safety asked for a recall. The center said the vehicles were defective because 
the gas tanks were located outside the frame rails and could explode when 
involved in side-impact crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 GM steadfastly maintained that the pickups were safe and met all federal 
safety standards. Under the Chevrolet and GMC nameplates, the company sold 9 
million C/K pickups with side-mounted tanks before the vehicles were redesigned 
in 1988 with the tanks inside the frame. About 5 million C/K pickups with 
side-mounted gas tanks are still on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle became a brawl in which GM aggressively took on not only the 
nation's top transportation official, but also trial lawyers, consumer 
advocates and the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Most safety issues involving autos are resolved between the manufacturer and 
regulators without litigation. Since the NHTSA's creation, only eight recall 
orders have been challenged, with the agency winning in all but one. 
</P>
<P>
 The GM case has been highly publicized since late 1992, when a federal judge 
in Texas unsealed 70,000 pages of GM documents submitted in a product-liability 
case. Among them was a memo that Clarence Ditlow, Center for Auto Safety 
president and one of GM's sharpest critics, argues proves that GM knew the 
dangers of the design in the early '70s but resisted changing it until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long afterward, the TV program "Dateline NBC" aired a critical report that 
purported to show GM pickups erupting into flames when hit in the side. The 
next month a Georgia jury awarded $105 million to the parents of Shannon 
Moseley, who died at 17 when his C/K pickup burst into flames after being 
broadsided. The award included $101 million in punitive damages, which jurors 
later said was intended as a message to GM to recall the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the auto maker went on the offensive. In a bravura performance at a 
January, 1993, press conference, GM Executive Vice President Harry Pearce 
methodically showed how "Dateline NBC" had rigged crash tests by using toy 
rockets to ignite fires. The network retracted the story. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also appealed the Moseley decision, and an appeals court 
overturned it in June, 1994, saying the plaintiffs' attorney had improperly 
introduced evidence of other deaths and the NHTSA investigation. The case was 
returned to the lower courts for a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 GM refused a NHTSA request for a voluntary recall in April, 1993. The agency 
continued its investigation, with engineers reviewing more than 400,000 pages 
of documents, conducting crash tests and doing extensive statistical analyses. 
By September, 1993, the agency's staff had decided that the vehicles should not 
be recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Gauthier, former director of NHTSA's office of defect investigation, 
said his staff concluded that although GM pickups posed a slightly greater 
safety risk of fire-related fatalities than Ford or Chrysler pickups in 
side-impact crashes, the risks were not "unreasonable" when compared to the 
performances of other cars and trucks. They recommended that the case be 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 No action was taken by Pena for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In his initial decision, Pena rejected the NHTSA recommendation and instead 
found that C/K pickups were defective and did pose an unreasonable safety risk. 
Pena said 150 people had died in fiery collisions in the C/K pickups and that 
32 more would die in subsequent years. He said that even though GM knew the 
side-mounted fuel-tank design was dangerous, it placed "sales over safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena also said that even though the GM pickups met all federal safety 
standards, the manufacturer still had an obligation to produce vehicles that 
operate safely in real-world conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 GM was outraged by the decision. Spokesman Bruce MacDonald declared the 
decision "totally unjustified" and called the suggestion that GM put sales of 
ahead of safety "outrageous and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said statistics show that C/K pickups are as safe as 
comparable Ford and Chrysler trucks and that all are about twice as safe as the 
average passenger car. They note that more than 50 other vehicles also use 
designs that place the gas tank outside the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the legal and scientific arguments, there was an emotional side to 
this debate that GM feared. NHTSA had scheduled a public meeting for Dec. 6 on 
the C/K pickup at which more than 30 burn victims or their relatives planned to 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
 GM sought to have the meeting canceled, and when that failed, it negotiated 
with the agency over the format. It was during those discussions last week that 
the settlement talks began. The agreement was reached early Friday and the 
meeting canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement will save hundreds of lives -- far more than ever have been 
saved by proceeding with a recall or closing the case," Pena said in a press 
conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumer groups harshly criticized the agreement as "unprincipled and 
irresponsible." They vowed to fight it in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement requires GM to help fund a government fire safety research 
laboratory; contribute to research for burn and trauma victims, crash-test 
dummies and drunk-driving, and to expend $8 million for child safety seats for 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said the settlement is an opportunity to improve auto safety through 
government and industry cooperation, and he took great pains to absolve Smith 
and other current GM executives of any taint in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have said a number of times the new management team in Detroit is a far 
more thoughtful group of leaders perhaps than many, many years ago, when safety 
wasn't as high a priority as it is today," Pena said.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; INVESTMENTS WITH A CAPITAL 'I'; AFTER NEARLY 
VANISHING, VENTURE CAPITAL IS ONCE MORE BECOMING AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been tough in recent times for a young company to get seed money from 
private investors or even for a struggling public company to raise cash from 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But Virtual Computer Corp. in Reseda picked up $75,000 recently to help it 
start production, and Platinum Software Corp. in Irvine won a fresh start with 
$13.8 million in new money. 
</P>
<P>
 Venture capital, once plentiful in the 1980s but nearly nonexistent in recent 
years, is once again becoming more available. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, 21 Southern California companies raised $84.2 million from venture 
capitalists during the third quarter of this year, according to the first 
nationwide survey detailing private investments into new, fledgling and rebuilt 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash is part of nearly $1 billion in venture capital invested in 293 
mostly small, privately held companies throughout the country, according to the 
survey by the Big Six accounting firm Price Waterhouse. The firm plans to track 
venture capital investments quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
 Price Waterhouse, which has reported on the New England venture capital market 
for more than a year, rolled out its national version mainly to collect and 
analyze information that could be useful to its high-technology clients. But 
the survey also acts as a barometer of regional and national economic health, 
said Janet F. Boling, a Price Waterhouse spokeswoman in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "From looking at other sources, I didn't think there was much venture capital 
around here at all," Boling said of Southern California. "But when we polled 
$84 million, I was very surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 More than $52.1 million went to 10 companies in the greater Los Angeles-Orange 
County area in the third quarter, and more than $31 million went to 11 San 
Diego firms, according to the survey. In addition, venture capitalists poured 
more than $228 million into 72 Northern California companies, mainly high-tech 
Silicon Valley operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Casselman is happy venture capitalists are back, because he hadn't been 
able to find new financing for his Virtual Computer, which builds auxiliary 
central processing units called co-processors that help the main microprocessor 
-- and heart of the computer -- run faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Casselman had won a $500,000 government contract -- most of it coming in the 
spring of 1991 -- through the federal Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) 
program. But that money only got him out of his living room and into an office 
with a few engineering employees. He needed more to develop the computer chip, 
produce it and market it worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had advertised in the Wall Street Journal for investors, and I advertised 
in Asian publications," he said. "I had a lot of calls, but none amounted to 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 Most, in fact, were crank calls, and Casselman got nowhere talking to venture 
capital firms and other possible investors. 
</P>
<P>
 But venture capitalist Tim Draper of Draper Associates in Redwood City called 
Casselman about two years ago to ask about another company Draper wanted to 
invest in. That conversation led to talks about Virtual Computer and, last 
year, to Draper's agreement to invest $300,000 in return for a 20% stake in 
Casselman's company. The venture firm funded $75,000 of that commitment during 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, Virtual Computer, with five employees, began shipping 
co-processors for large Sun Microsystems workstation computers. Casselman said 
he hopes to develop generic co-processors early next year for IBM and Apple 
computers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 His good fortune continued last month when his company won one of three SBIR 
Technology of the Year awards from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Virtual Computer and most other companies attracting venture capital, 
Platinum Software was an established, though battered, public company. Last 
April, the accounting software company's top managers resigned after announcing 
that revenue for the previous two fiscal years had been overstated by more than 
$18 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelo J. Santoro was brought in as chief executive to restructure and revive 
the 10-year-old company, which was facing a Securities and Exchange Commission 
investigation and lawsuits by its investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I did nothing, we would have been bankrupt by August or September," 
Santoro said. "I started thinking of raising about $10 million to $15 million, 
but with the SEC investigation and the unsettled lawsuits, there was no way I 
could go to a public offering." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he called two venture capitalists he had worked with on other 
projects. Santoro told them Platinum was in trouble but sensed that the 
problems could be fixed and the company could prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 They balked at first, worrying that any money they brought in would go to the 
attorneys in the civil lawsuits. Santoro soon settled the class-action 
lawsuits, though the settlements are awaiting court approval. The SEC 
investigation is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the venture capitalists stepped in. Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & 
Byers in Menlo Park and New Enterprise Associates in Baltimore led an investor 
group that paid nearly $13.8 million for 2.5 million shares of preferred stock, 
which can be converted to common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us credibility," Santoro said about the investment. "The money is 
going to stay in the bank. I now believe we will turn the corner and show a 
positive cash flow during this fiscal year with the money we had left. We need 
the (venture capital) money in the bank to give customers confidence that this 
company is not in financial jeopardy." Start-Up Funds 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California companies have raised $84.2 million in venture capital in 
the third quarter of this year, a sign of increased availability of funds for 
startup companies. About a third of total went to firms in the 
healthcare/biotechnology sector.

 Beyond GATT: With many Southern California businesses eagerly looking forward 
to their expected expanded world trade opportunities resulting from the U.S. 
Congress' approval last week of the expanded General Agreement on Tariffs, a 
conference this week will take a more sobering look at the aftermath of the 
approval of the agreement. The three-day meeting beginning Friday at 9 a.m. at 
UCLA's Griffin Commons Conference Center will explore the impact of the new 
GATT agreement on different trading blocs around the world and "the emerging 
threats to the world trading order." California has more global trade than any 
other state.

 Economic Prospects Explored: Chapman University economists roll out their 
annual economic forecast for Orange County on Thursday. With recent signs 
pointing to the beginnings of a long-awaited recovery from the 1990-92 
recession that gripped much of California, expect Chapman President James Doti, 
the originator of the forecast, to draw a sizable crowd to the $100-per-person 
event at the private campus in the heart of Orange.Local business leaders use 
economic forecasts to help with their advance planning. In addition to the 
Chapman report, now in its 17th year, Cal State Fullerton issues an annual 
Orange County forecast and UC Irvine prepares a yearly survey of executive 
attitudes toward the economy. Chapman's 1995 prognosis and a companion 
five-year forecast by Esmael Adibi, director of the university's Center for 
Economic Research, will be unveiled Thursday at the campus' Memorial Hall 
beginning at 2:45 p.m.

PCS LICENSE AUCTION GETS GOING TODAY; TELECOM: BIG PLAYERS DOMINATE WHAT'S 
EXPECTED TO BE THE BIGGEST FCC WIRELESS PERMIT SALE YET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of publicity and financial jockeying, a surprisingly large number 
of companies will sit out today's start of the federal government's 
multibillion-dollar auction of licenses for a new generation of wireless 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
 But the absence of numerous prospective bidders is unlikely to dim the luster 
of an event that will be presided over by Vice President Al Gore and Federal 
Communications Chairman Reed E. Hundt, and has attracted many of the biggest 
names in telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's auction of 99 broad-band licenses to launch an affordable mobile phone 
network for the masses will be by far the largest and most important in a 
series of controversial license sales that began this summer and have so far 
widely exceeded financial expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be one of the defining moments for wireless communications," said 
Todd Wolfenbarger, a spokesman for McCaw Cellular, the nation's largest 
cellular phone operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal communications services, or PCS, license auction will offer a 
rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what some predict will become 
a booming $40-billion-a-year market for wireless communications by early in the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
 PCS holds the promise of go-anywhere mobile communications that will permit 
consumers to send and receive phone calls, computer data and faxes through 
devices as small and as unobtrusive as a wristwatch. They could be available in 
major cities within a few years at a monthly rate below that for cellular 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the nation's perspective, the auction is important in paving the way for 
vigorous hand-to-hand competition in wireless markets," FCC Chairman Hundt 
said. "In the very near future, mobile communications is going to be (as 
commonplace) as the sale of bread . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The auction, which will likely last several days, is expected to generate more 
than $10 billion over the next five years -- more revenue than Uncle Sam has 
raised over the past half a century selling offshore oil-drilling rights to 
private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 74 applicants met a registration deadline to bid on licenses for the 
wireless telephone technology, just 30 later submitted the hefty cash deposits 
to qualify them to bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute no-shows in the FCC auction include such prominent players as 
the computer data giant EDS of Plano, Tex., Radio-fone Nationwide Paging 
Services of Matarie, La., and U.S. Airwaves, headed by a former US West 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a recent Standard & Poor analysis determined that some of the biggest 
auction participants could borrow as much as $5.6 billion to pay for PCS 
licenses, the large number of no-shows has added to concern that bidding in the 
FCC's richest auction may not be as spirited as the first one in July. That 
event drew $800 million in bids -- about 10 times more than expected -- for 10 
nationwide licenses for a new wireless paging service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department has been investigating whether some recent alliances 
formed to bid in the PCS auction could violate federal antitrust laws. The 
probe was launched after several big telecommunications companies -- including 
three of the regional Bell telephone companies as well as two of the nation's 
biggest long-distance carriers, AT&T and Sprint Corp. -- began forming 
partnerships or acquiring rivals to fortify their financial war chests for 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 The competitiveness of the bidding might be further undercut by the fact that 
the FCC has already awarded -- at below-market prices -- three lucrative PCS 
licenses covering Southern California, New York City and Washington, D.C., 
under a controversial preference policy to reward PCS technology innovators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that the average PCS price will be all that high," said Betty 
Massick-Columbo, a telecommunications analyst at S.G. Warburg & Co. in New 
York. "The alliances that are being formed dramatically reduce the number of 
bidders for each market (and) . . . the business case for the financial 
viability of PCS is unclear enough that the companies will be very careful in 
their bidding strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Damianakes, a spokeswoman for PSC Primeco, the PCS limited partnership of 
Bell Atlantic, Nynex, US West and AirTouch Communications, would not comment on 
the strategy of her partnership, but agreed that bidding could be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to be very clear on your strategy and price points," she 
said. "It's going to be a long chess game." 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC has spent nearly $400,000 to outfit a vacant postal service room near 
the Capitol with more than 20 bidding booths and a dozen operator phone banks 
to field bids from auction participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Bids will be entered on the computer terminals and conducted in 
three-hour-long rounds, and participants will be allowed to re-evaluate their 
initial bids or drop out of competition for 20 minutes after each bidding 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhausting bidders' financial resources could take some time, however, since 
the 30 participants include many telecommunications heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
 All seven of the regional Bell companies are bidding, for instance. Three of 
them -- US West, Bell Atlantic and Nynex -- are part of a consortium headed by 
cellular provider AirTouch Communications and have plunked down a deposit of 
$55 million to bid on 26 PCS licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Another consortium made up of long-distance carrier Sprint Corp. and three of 
the nation's largest cable TV companies is also bidding on more than two dozen 
licenses. Other deep-pocket bidders include AT&T and its recently acquired 
McCaw Cellular unit, GTE, Pacific Telesis Mobile Services and a new company 
called ALAACR Communications, which is headed by cellular phone mogul Craig 
McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Several PSC applicants that dropped out of competition said they were deterred 
by the financial firepower of these big players. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitelcom, the wireless subsidiary of the Virgin Island telephone company, said 
it applied to bid and was financially prepared to submit a multimillion-dollar 
deposit but was scared off by the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not the deposit but the financial commitment overall and what it would 
take to play seriously against these other companies," said John W. Hunter, a 
Washington communications lawyer who represents Vitelcom. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of a diverse PCS ownership pool for the large licenses, however, 
could thwart development of the kind of intense competition that drove down 
long-distance phone rates following the breakup of the AT&T monopoly, some 
critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some auction participants now concede that PCS won't compete head-on with 
the cellular phone network but, rather, will compliment it because so many PCS 
bidders are made up of cellular firms looking to fill holes in their coverage 
areas with new wireless technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think more and more people are not looking at PCS as replacement 
technology, but looking at it as an extension of cellular at a different 
(radio) frequency," said Wolfenbarger of McCaw. That synergy, he added, is what 
attracts companies like McCaw to PCS.

63% WOULD CONSIDER BUYING AN ELECTRIC CAR, SURVEY FINDS 
</P>

<P>
 Roughly 63% of Californians who expect to buy a new car would consider 
purchasing an electric vehicle -- far higher than the estimates of most auto 
makers, according to a market-research survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, a third of the 400 Californians questioned said they would be willing 
to pay more for an electric car than for a gasoline-powered model, according to 
the telephone survey, commissioned by Automotive News and done in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the random survey are being made public to coincide with the 
12th International Electric Vehicle Symposium, on through Wednesday in Anaheim. 
</P>

 "If I were a manufacturer forced to sell these products, I would be pleasantly 
surprised to see these figures," said Doug C. Dohring, chairman and chief 
executive of Dohring Co., the Glendale firm that conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer acceptance of electric cars -- which could cost more initially while 
offering more limited performance -- has been hotly debated. The auto makers, 
and some other surveys, have showed more skepticism for electric cars' market 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 Gallup Poll of U.S. drivers found that 49% would be "interested" in 
buying an electric car. Last year, however, no more than 25% of new car buyers 
said they would be willing to "consider" an electric car, according to a survey 
by J.D. Power & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "there has been a lot more exposure" to electric cars in the past year, 
Dohring said, offering one explanation for his survey's more optimistic 
results. The Dohring poll found that 64% of the respondents have now seen an 
electric vehicle, at least on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Another survey, still being evaluated by the Institute of Transportation 
Studies at UC Davis, also indicates that people apparently like electric 
vehicles the more they know about them. In that survey so far, half the 450 
households polled -- all of which had at least two cars -- would be willing to 
buy an electric car that costs about the same as a gas one but that has a much 
more limited range.

industrialized nations, with annual growth of 6.4%, according to official 
figures. The July-September quarter gain was a jump from revised growth of 1.4% 
in gross domestic product for the April-June quarter. The rate exceeded 
analysts' expectations for a quarterly GDP of 1% and annual growth of 5.5%.

THE PACIFIC; JAPAN LOOKING TO GATT TO EASE TENSIONS; TRADE: BUT THE NEW ACCORD 
IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE ANY IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON TOKYO'S DISPUTES WITH U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan, which made some key concessions to be included in the new world trade 
accord approved by its lower house of Parliament on Friday, believes the 
agreement will eventually make it easier to resolve international trade 
frictions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the expanded General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which passed the U.S. 
Congress last Thursday, will have little immediate effect on U.S.-Japan 
disputes, particularly tensions over the huge U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 
automobiles and auto parts. Such trade accounts for about two-thirds of the 
overall $60-billion U.S. deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, Tokyo and Washington disagree on whether the dispute-settlement 
mechanism of the World Trade Organization, established under the expanded GATT, 
is appropriate for the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has threatened sanctions against Japan under Section 301 of U.S. 
trade law if Japan refuses to take measures to increase purchases of 
replacement auto parts. Tokyo has said that it would probably appeal any U.S. 
actions under Section 301 to the WTO. But Washington has insisted that nothing 
in the agreements setting up the WTO would block use of such retaliatory trade 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the new accord does not address specific points of the dispute 
over automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has pressed especially hard for Tokyo to agree to 
"results-oriented" measures to boost exports of American automobiles and auto 
parts to Japan. The United States has suggested that the Japanese government 
relax various regulations that discourage the import of foreign auto parts. 
Washington also wants Tokyo to help boost the number of dealerships in Japan 
that carry foreign automobiles, and to encourage Japanese auto makers to 
increase their purchases of foreign parts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tokyo insists that it cannot yield to many of the key U.S. demands. 
Japanese officials have described regulations in the replacement auto parts 
market as necessary for safety, and have said some other key U.S. requests 
would require improper interference by the government in the affairs of private 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Japan have not set a date to resume talks on automobiles 
and auto parts. Negotiations are moving forward, however, in some other areas. 
The two sides are due to meet this week in Washington to try to hammer out a 
final agreement on market-opening measures for Japan's $4.5-billion flat-glass 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere for the bilateral talks may be helped by renewed enthusiasm in 
Japan for the new world trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's upper house of Parliament is expected to approve the GATT agreement 
this week, having largely defused domestic opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 As a key part of last year's global agreement to expand GATT, Japan promised 
to gradually open its rice market to foreign imports, promising to allow in 
rice supplies equal to 4% of domestic consumption in 1995, with that figure 
rising to 8% by 2000. Japanese farmers bitterly opposed the concession when it 
was first made. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, as part of a package of legislation to approve the agreement, 
Tokyo is enacting a six-year plan to spend about $60 billion in rural areas to 
help farmers cope with the impact of liberalized agricultural trade. This plan, 
which includes direct subsidies to farmers and funding for rural infrastructure 
projects, helped to ensure easy passage by Japan's parliament of the 
legislation to approve the trade accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese government officials and business leaders place high hopes in the 
idea that multilateral rules set up and enforced by the WTO will make it easier 
to avoid bilateral disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all Japanese businessmen care very much about what happens in the 
future with WTO," said Masaru Yamano, vice chairman of Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. 
"For world peace management, it's the United Nations, but as for economic 
matters, the WTO should play the same role as the (United Nations). The 
settlement of international disputes should be done through the WTO."

 Foreign Investment Rises 44%: In the first 10 months of the year, foreign 
investment in China rose 44% to $25.234 billion, the official China media 
reports.What investors have pledged to spend in the future continued to drop, 
however, with $62.58 billion promised for 37,735 projects through October. This 
year is certain to top last year's $26 billion, according to the newspapers. 
Last year only the United States attracted more foreign investment, with $32 
billion. Overseas companies are keen to tap into the world's fastest-growing 
economy and most-populous market. Since China began opening to the world in 
1978, foreigners have invested $83 billion.

 Car Exports to Europe Boost October Gain: Japan's vehicle exports in October 
registered their biggest gain in 20 months, the result of a 50.8% surge in 
sales to Western Europe, a trade association said. The Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Assn. said total exports of cars, trucks and buses rose 4.0% from 
last October to 364,439 units.The increase, led by Toyota Motor Corp., was the 
biggest year-on-year rise in any month since March, 1993. Exports to the United 
States fell 2.6% to 125,334 units and exports to Asia also fell 2.6%, to 51,203 
units, the industry association said. Exports to the European Union rose, 
however, to 62,564 vehicles. The percentage gain in exports to the EU was so 
large chiefly because exports a year earlier were very low, said Keith 
Donaldson, an auto analyst at Salomon Bros. Japan's car exports fell sharply 
and without interruption through the last half of 1993 and the first half of 
this year, as auto makers seeking to escape the effects of the strong yen moved 
production out of Japan.

AN APPRECIATION; SHE USED HER 'UNIQUE GIFT' TO HELP KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 "She could have done something smaller. It was like an enormous storm came 
into her life and she absorbed its power. Her sails opened and she harnessed 
the power of the wind." 
</P>
<P>
 That was Elizabeth Glaser, according to Josh Baran, who was among the friends 
on Sunday recalling her fierce dedication and tireless efforts to raise money 
and awareness of AIDS. Glaser died Saturday from AIDS-related complications at 
the age of 47. 
</P>
<P>
 While she raced against an ever-ticking clock, Glaser never lost her love of 
life and continued to inspire those around her even as she struggled with the 
devastating effects of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her very public work, "Elizabeth became more of who she already was," 
said Susan DeLaurentis, who with Glaser and Susan Zeegan co-founded the 
Pediatric AIDS Foundation. At the end of 1993 the group had raised $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said we have the answers if we look inside ourselves, and she used a lot 
of that inner strength to go and make the difference that she did," said 
DeLaurentis.  
</P>
<P>
 "She instilled a sense of adventure in everyone. If you wanted to be her 
friend, you had to be adventurous, you had to throw caution to the wind and 
embrace life. She would challenge me to do things, not just with the 
foundation, with everything, going on a trip somewhere, from the mundane to the 
magnificent." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Zeegan: "The work she did was a lifeline, and it helped her find the 
strength to be vocal and pro-active. . . . More than anything she taught us to 
appreciate every day and live life the best we can, knowing that we've been 
loving and kind each day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Glaser was her hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have one-tenth of her courage as I lead my public life and my private 
life," she said, "I will indeed be fortunate. She came to me when I was serving 
on the budget committee of the House of Representatives. She taught me that 
pediatric AIDS needed special attention and it was getting none. I got her 
appointments with the speaker of the House, the leader of the House and the key 
players in Congress. I also brought her before the budget committee to testify. 
I knew once the door was open she would never be denied. She wasn't. But now we 
must continue to fight, as lonely as it will be without (her)." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was always looking on the constructive side of things, never on the 
competitive," said Dr. Michael Gottlieb, Glaser's personal physician and a 
member of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation's advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole spirit of the foundation was to break down the walls between the 
labs -- to get scientists and doctors to brainstorm and cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gottlieb said, it was Glaser's "strong competitive spirit" that fueled 
her dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never got on a tennis court with her, and for good reason," he said. "She 
went full-throttle with whatever she did. She realized she had what it took to 
move people, move people to give money for this cause, and that she had a 
unique gift. . . . I think there was an initial phase in confronting the HIV 
virus and accepting it, and then she quickly moved beyond the fear and 
discovered she had the power to change things." 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser contracted the HIV virus through a blood transfusion in 1981, then 
passed it on to her two children. Her daughter, Ariel, died in 1988, and son 
Jake, now 10, has been diagnosed HIV positive. Her husband, director Paul 
Michael Glaser, did not become infected. 
</P>
<P>
 Baran, a public relations consultant who worked with Elizabeth Glaser, 
recalled being in her dining room when she was just forming the Pediatric AIDS 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was late one night and she asked me to come over. Her daughter was in the 
hospital, and she said she couldn't save Ari, but she had to do something to 
raise awareness. I said, 'Here are the choices. You can do fund-raisers and 
bake sales, small things, or you can do big things.' And she said, 'I want to 
do the biggest possible thing. I don't have time. I'm on a different timetable. 
I have no patience.' . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a few weeks we were meeting with senators, and with President Reagan. 
She had an enormous fire in her belly and determination that was unstoppable. . 
. . Everything she did was about saving the lives of her children and other 
children. I don't think she even thought about saving her own life." 
</P>
<P>
 Baran was with Glaser at the Democratic National Convention in 1992 when she 
gave an impassioned speech about the need to take action in the fight against 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an extraordinary moment," he recalled. "She had so memorized her 
speech that it allowed her to make it completely come from her heart. Suddenly 
the rabble became quiet and you could feel the connection, could feel her 
touching the hearts of millions of people at that moment. She later said she 
felt the presence of her daughter holding her hand at the podium. After that 
she was in a state of exhilaration. We went out and drank tequila until 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "To us that speech was remarkable -- but no more remarkable than the rest of 
her life."

HAPPILY EVER AFTER?; A BITTER CUSTODY BATTLE, CHILD-MOLESTATION ALLEGATIONS 
AGAINST HER EX-HUSBAND AND A JAIL TERM. NOW ELIZABETH MORGAN HAS JUST ONE WISH: 
TO RETURN TO THE U.S. WITH HER DAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA BLUMENFELD, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been five years since a tense, gaunt Elizabeth Morgan emerged from the 
District of Columbia jail where she had spent 25 months for refusing to 
disclose her daughter's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The plastic surgeon from suburban Virginia had waged Washington's most costly, 
nasty custody battle, alleging that her doctor-husband, Eric Foretich, had 
sexually abused their baby daughter, Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
 When a court ordered unsupervised visitation for the father, Morgan instead 
sent Hilary, then 5, into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilary was here, living in a motel with her grandparents. She had a new name, 
Ellen, and a new life in the flat, green calm of Christchurch. Eventually, her 
father tracked her down, but he could not bring her back. By then Morgan was 
out of jail, and a New Zealand court awarded her custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at first glance, Morgan seems happy. Ellen, now 12, seems happy too. 
They are living in a place of tearooms and garden cottages, surrounded by deer 
farms and apricot orchards, a city of prim eccentricity where musicians with 
sorcerer's bells on their shoes roam the cafes playing flutes, where the 
official town wizard in black velvet robes preaches to a lunchtime crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals know the story of the American runaways, but few bring it up; 
Christchurchers do not pry. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a strange life. Elizabeth Morgan is a doctor who cannot practice 
medicine. She has drained her mother's savings account and has broken into her 
own retirement fund. They cannot leave the country without permission; their 
passports are under lock and key at the New Zealand family court. If Morgan 
returns to the United States, she could face the same contempt-of-court charges 
that put her in jail. Until 2000, when Ellen turns 18 and the custody case 
becomes moot, they are stuck here. 
</P>
<P>
 To Morgan, home is as concrete as Washington, D.C. To Ellen, home is less a 
city than a feeling, an untroubled state of mind she would like to know. For 
now, though, mother and daughter remain in their respective exiles. And beneath 
the tranquillity of their days is something forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The truth of what happened nine years ago may never be known. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical testimony was inconclusive. Doctors found physical trauma that was 
consistent with abuse, but if the girl was abused, no one could say by whom. 
Ellen names her father with an unshakable conviction. The father denies it. 
</P>
<P>
 Can a child be brainwashed into believing a lie? Can two children be 
brainwashed? 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate custody battle, Ellen's older half-sister also reported that her 
father had sexually abused her. Later she recanted, and later still she accused 
him again. In that case Foretich was denied visitation because the visits upset 
the girl. He was never charged with a crime, nor was there ever a ruling that 
he had abused a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth may no longer even exist, reality having long ago been overtaken by 
perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, Morgan came across as an unpleasant woman: vindictive, manipulative, 
messianic. But wouldn't any mother -- convinced that such an unspeakable 
betrayal had taken place -- behave just like that? 
</P>
<P>
 The father seemed evasive, creepy, cold, filled with aggressive fury. But 
wouldn't any father -- wrongly accused of raping a child -- behave just like 
that? 
</P>
<P>
 The only accessible truth is what we see in Christchurch. Morgan has agreed to 
talk to a reporter at some personal risk. The local court has warned her not to 
speak to the press about Ellen. But public support helped free Morgan from jail 
once. Maybe it could work for her again: She wants out. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan is 47, her dramatic black hair now softened with gray. She is likably 
unconventional, patient with her daughter, quick to admit to and sometimes 
laugh at the tumult that is her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen is a spirited child. She has grown nine inches in the past year and a 
half and is filled with adolescent fizz. She cuddles stray cats, goofs around 
with her girlfriends at the ice rink and perks up at TV kissing scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a third Morgan living here -- Elizabeth's mother, Antonia, 80. She 
wears good wool cardigans and carries floral handkerchiefs, looks frail but can 
still hop a fence. It was Antonia who, with her husband, helped spirit Hilary 
away. (Bill Morgan returned to the United States three months after his 
daughter arrived here.) 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a year, Morgan's new husband visits. He is a federal judge who lives in 
Washington, a white-haired, black-jeaned gentle man named Paul Michel. Distance 
tests their marriage: His monthlong visits jangle with urgency. He could never 
live here, he says: "It's like living on Mars." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Ellen is a typical Kiwi girl -- athletic, uncomplicated. Unlike 
Morgan, a bookworm who by the age of 12 had skipped two grades, Ellen thrives 
on a newfound passion: ice skating. Her mother's and grandmother's intellectual 
musings exasperate her. ("There's no need to philosophize about candy -- just 
eat it," she teases.) Ellen's main goal is to skate in the Olympics, 
representing New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go to college in Sweden," Ellen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not raising you in Sweden. I'm not learning Swedish." 
</P>
<P>
 "Start learning." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad you've settled our life, Ellen." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, Switzerland. We'll train for the Olympics there." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no! I want to go back to America." 
</P>
<P>
 But what of America does Ellen remember? Trick or treating once in a Care Bear 
costume, living near the White House, taking a nap one time in kindergarten -- 
that's it, Ellen says, her hands in fists. Fiercer impressions, the ones she 
has shared with her mother and Antonia, she does not volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's family night out. Morgan's husband is here on one of his visits. Michel, 
53, looks like a slightly goofy aristocrat: a man of noble bearing who wears 
crimson socks and white sneakers and an expression of stubborn good cheer. He 
is a federal Court of Appeals judge, a man of formidable power. He is a puppy 
on Ellen's leash. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cobb & Co. restaurant, a hostess shows Morgan, Michel, Antonia and 
Ellen to a table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ellen, I'll sit across from you," Michel says. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time I saw her, she was hiding under a table, facing the wall.  
</P>
<P>
 "Can you survive without us?" Morgan jokes as the adults head for the salad 
bar. Michel turns back. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen eats a potato wedge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ellen, I like to see you enjoy yourself," Michel says. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking her to visitation was like seeing her go through chemotherapy, 
stone-faced, pale. Halfway back, I stopped the car. Ellen wasn't breathing 
normal; I thought she might faint or die.  
</P>
<P>
 Ellen is talking about the "queen witch," a schoolteacher: "I hope I don't get 
her next year, I'll kill myself." Michel laughs at this. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end she was suicidal. She asked her mother: If I throw myself down the 
stairs, will I be dead?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For 2 1/2 years, Ellen's only stable landmark was McDonald's. She wandered the 
world with her grandparents -- Nassau, the Bahamas; Toronto; Vancouver, B.C.; 
Glasgow, Scotland; England; Singapore; Auckland, and Christchurch. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids in the Bahamas called her "little white girl"; kids in New Zealand called 
her "little English girl." All the while her grandparents reminded her that she 
was a little American girl on the run from her daddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill and Antonia Morgan seemed perfect for the journey. Both are 
psychologists. He is a former spy for the Office of Strategic Services. They 
posed as a retired couple taking their granddaughter on a pleasure trip. In 
fact, they were a bleak threesome: a rheumatic British woman and the blustering 
American man who had divorced years before, and a 5-year-old clutching her pink 
blanket, "Quilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen refused to have her hair cut -- she was afraid Morgan wouldn't recognize 
her. She had to write her mother a letter for an assignment at school in 
England. Ellen asked the teacher: "How do you spell jail ?" 
</P>
<P>
 They had a pay phone installed in their Plymouth, England, apartment so that 
overseas calls couldn't be traced. They saw an ad in the British press offering 
$50,000 for Ellen's return. "How much?" she asked, amazed. "For a girl like 
me?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was time to move on -- to a country that hadn't signed the Hague 
Convention, where there was no fear of deportation, where America was far away 
enough to forget -- New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 And then in February, 1990, after all their precautions, the police rapped on 
the door of the Morgans' room at the Diplomat Motel. Eric Foretich had found 
them. The police were followed almost immediately by news photographers, who 
swarmed outside their ground-floor suite, banging on the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arms linked, backs bent, mother and daughter are quacking around the patio. 
"We're having a duck conversation," Morgan says to Michel. She and Ellen are 
feeding lettuce leaves to wild ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ducks reject the lettuce. "Maybe you didn't quack correctly," Michel says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was quacking quite correctly," deadpans Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a black-and-white photograph: glossy black hair and matte white skin, 
dark lips and inkwell eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's playful, not afraid to do things," Michel says warmly, looking up from 
a legal brief. "Other people would think she's bonkers." 
</P>
<P>
 Other people do. As Morgan puts it: "I have had to deal with the fact that 
most people assumed I was insane." 
</P>
<P>
 For 25 months she lived in a 6-foot-by-11-foot cell, slept four hours a night, 
had to use a toilet in front of guards of both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 She sobbed into her blanket and cursed out loud the judge who put her there. 
She studied ballet from a textbook, gripping her bunk as a barre. She 
interviewed inmates about their childhood abuse, material she is now using for 
a doctoral dissertation in psychology. She scrawled in crayon on the dirty 
cinder-block wall, "Was mich nicht zugrunde richtet macht mich starker" (what 
doesn't kill me outright makes me stronger). 
</P>
<P>
 But Morgan was frailer than ever when a special congressional bill released 
her in September, 1989. During her early days in Christchurch, she snapped 
easily, talked constantly, subsisted on chocolate and 13 cups of coffee a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the spring of 1991, there came a turning point. Morgan was weeping, 
sitting on a log by a flowering magnolia tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what you have," she said. "The tree is beautiful and your child is 
safe and what you do with the rest is up to you." If she didn't recover, she 
reasoned, neither would Ellen. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Michel arrived for a visit and saw a dark-haired woman at the 
airport, waving and laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attractive woman," he thought, and then he was stunned. It was his wife. He 
didn't recognize her -- she was smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan smiles a lot now -- a smart, intense, grand-lipped smile. But 
melancholy is close to the surface. Walking through town one afternoon, she 
passes an ambulance: "I miss medicine. There was a time people had a problem 
and I could fix it." She still carries her card from the Medical Society of the 
District of Columbia to remind herself who she once was. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spring break is over, back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen, in a kilt and blazer, runs down the schoolyard path, joining a group of 
classmates in straw derbies. They are nice to Ellen, but there's the sense that 
she isn't one of them. Her mother doesn't bake bread like the other mums. Her 
mother taught her to omit male references to God during prayers. Ellen's two 
best friends at school are outsiders, too -- one Chinese, one Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
 Most days, while Ellen is at school, Morgan works on her dissertation on 
childhood trauma. This day, she talks about her daughter: "This case comes down 
to Ellen -- whether she's a crazy, brainwashed robot and lied." 
</P>
<P>
 So this afternoon, Morgan agrees to try something new, to let Ellen speak 
publicly, for herself: "Now that Ellen is healed, it's a matter of her 
reputation." Morgan picks her up from school, and they drive to Ellen's 
favorite restaurant -- McDonald's, where a kiwi bird perches on the golden 
arches. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen dissects a cheeseburger and chats happily about school. The best part of 
her day: The French teacher was absent. Then Morgan stammers, "Ellen, darling. 
. . ." And something in her voice warns Ellen. "Yes," the girl says, in the 
haughty tone she adopts when she feels threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason the reporter is here is to let you speak for yourself. You can be 
mad at me if you want. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen looks more scared than angry. Finally, she speaks: "I would like to go 
back to America." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are there people in America you don't want to see? It could be me too." Now 
it's Morgan who looks frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why wouldn't I want to see you?" Ellen asks. Her cheeks redden and then: 
"There are lots of people I'd like to do some really inhumane things to." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, sweetheart, so you don't feel pressed, I'm going to go get some more 
hot chocolate." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan walks away. Ellen looks as if something inside is breaking apart. She 
jumps up and follows her mother. A few minutes later, she returns on Morgan's 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was saying," Ellen says, sitting very straight, "I'd like to go home and 
see my cousins. But I wouldn't like to see Judge Dixon or the Foretiches." 
</P>
<P>
 She decapitates a french fry on Foretiches . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How can this story end happily? 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean if I could wave a magic wand?" says Morgan, her face brightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would live in Maryland, Chevy Chase. We would live with Paul. Ellen would 
go to high school at Holton-Arms with her cousin. I would set up a clinic at 
the D.C. jail for the abused children of criminals. I would teach surgeons 
about psychological recovery from trauma. I would earn money and support us for 
a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul would still be a judge and we'd meet for lunch every single day of the 
week at the grill at the ANA Westin Hotel. Antonia would live with us. She 
would be in good health and she would see all her grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "My most important wish is just to walk around the Tidal Basin with Ellen and 
Paul. I want to see the cherry blossoms again." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Ellen is asked the same question, for her version of a hocus-pocus 
happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a silly question," she says, taken aback. "I don't have a magic wand."

 "We had decided to get married before moving in together. But then plans were 
lagging. So over dinner one Friday evening, I said, 'If you don't plan to get 
engaged soon, this would be a nice weekend to move out.' Within 45 minutes we 
went to the Glendale Galleria and bought a ring."

together the television show, 'Will You Marry Me?' They needed six surprise 
proposals (to film). I set up a mock karaoke contest at the Media City Center. 
My girlfriend gets up in front of 50 people and picks a card telling her what

 "She was told to watch the video monitor. There was a couple walking on the

backstage, held both her hands and said, 'Kelly Irene Miller, I love you madly.

it quits.'  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember trying to talk her into it. She was backing up and backing up. I 
talked to one of her friends who said, 'You can't make her . . . ' At least a 
month later she started talking about the wedding, who to invite, where to have 
it. And I said, 'Wait a minute, you haven't said yes. Will you marry me?' And 
she said, 'Yes, I will.' "

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; POPPING THE QUESTION; SOMETIMES, WHEN THE TIMING'S 
ALL WRONG, IT'S ALL RIGHT 
</P>

<P>
 She had her chance. Two glasses of Merlot. A Duraflame in the fireplace. 
Sinatra on the CD player. Our two dogs snoozing in the middle of the living 
room. The two of us in our customary places on the sofa, where we have shared 
so many great conversations.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is It," I thought to myself. I didn't think it, exactly. The idea seemed 
to pop up on its own, an unexpected voice-over interrupting a stock domestic 
scene we had reprised night on night for almost two years. 
</P>
<P>
 When a man says, "This is It," to himself, he is either having a heart attack 
or about to ask a woman to marry him. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a pretty good idea which one I was dealing with. We had talked about It, 
hinting around It, even sort of planned for It, eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 But before we could do It, we needed The Right Moment.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, we're not a couple you'd ever find on a Harlequin cover. We don't go in 
for bodice ripping. (Have you priced bodices lately?) Nor are we particularly 
big on knee-bending, ring-flourishing, heart-fluttering or violin-serenading. 
</P>
<P>
 Our postmodern sensibilities recoiled at the idea of manufacturing The Right 
Moment from some cheesy, B-movie script. We're more Kafka than Capra. For us, 
The Right Moment would have to be subtle, sublime. It would have to insinuate 
itself, give a little tap on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, as the male, it was up to me to recognize -- and presumably seize 
-- The Right Moment whenever it happened along. This was implicitly understood. 
We're not that postmodern. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is It," the voice in my head announced. It sounded alarmingly like James 
Earl Jones intoning "This . . . is CNN." 
</P>
<P>
 I smiled over at her, trying to look nonchalant, but she's too sharp. She saw 
something in my face.  
</P>
<P>
 "What's the matter?" she asked. It's too late to turn back now, James Earl 
Jones said. Go for it, Sylvester Stallone added. It's now or never, Elvis 
opined.  
</P>
<P>
 I conducted a quick atmospheric check. Fire, crackling. Dogs, cute. Wine, a 
little young, but not impertinent. Sinatra --  
</P>
<P>
 "Love and marriage. Love and marriage. They go together like the horse and 
carriage. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget it. No way. I can't ask this woman to marry me with the theme from 
"Married . . . With Children" as the soundtrack! Corniness like that can get 
you arrested in this town.  
</P>
<P>
 "This I tell you, brother," sang Frank, "you can't have one without the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's up?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing," I said.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a short song. The next one was "I've Got You Under My Skin," which just 
so happens to be my all-time favorite Sinatra song. All right. We'll just sit 
tight for another minute or so and then. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I smiled at her again. She smiled back, but then a look of startled surprise 
crossed her face. Damn, she's on to me! 
</P>
<P>
 She leaped from the couch and practically ran to the CD player. "Melrose 
Place!" she cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't have one . . . " Frank sang.  
</P>
<P>
 "Can't it wait one more minute?" I appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't have none . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's on right now ," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't ha-" 
</P>
<P>
 Click. Off went Frank. Click. On went the TV. Even the dogs got up and left.  
</P>
<P>
 Like I said, she had her chance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I had done my best. I wasn't going to wait for The Right Moment anymore. Thus 
snubbed (although, in fairness, the snubber was completely unaware of the 
snubbing), I vowed to wait for precisely The Wrong Moment.  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't have long to wait.  
</P>
<P>
 The very next weekend, for reasons that make sense only on a Sunday afternoon, 
we ventured out to take a close-up look at the Hollywood sign. After a few 
wasted hours of driving and walking up and down endless, twisting streets, we 
somehow wound up on the CityWalk at Universal Studios.  
</P>
<P>
 On the list of things I hope will be destroyed in the next earthquake, 
Universal Studios ranks behind only strip malls and the Angelyne billboards. My 
girlfriend doesn't like it nearly that much.  
</P>
<P>
 Fatigued and famished, we grudgingly decided to stop at Gladstone's along the 
CityWalk for a bowl of chowder and a view of the fake beach. We sat outside in 
the cold and watched the tourists. I sat with my back to a giant, neon-rimmed 
King Kong. Our waiter futilely tried to light the gas torch above our table. 
The Rolling Stones' "Dead Flowers" blared over the loudspeaker.  
</P>
<P>
 Perfect.  
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to get married?" 
</P>
<P>
 She smiled. I can see I'm not going to get off that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this a proposal?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pause. Millisecond of prickly panic. Then: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it is."  
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute! Whose voice was that? It sure didn't sound like mine. Didn't 
sound like James Earl Jones, either. It sounded more like my dad.  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 I said, wait a minute! Hold on! Did we just do what I think we did? Has this 
actually happened? Did I really want it to? Oh, God . . . OK, get a grip. 
Exhale, try not to faint, and for Pete's sake, act happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugs. Kisses. Chowder everywhere. Then, without warning, she punched me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew you were going to do this to me!" she said. "Now I'll have to tell 
everybody for the rest of my life that I got engaged at Universal Studios!"  
</P>
<P>
 I rubbed the new bruise on my arm, and only now do I know that, somehow, some 
way, I managed to pick The Right Moment.  
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it picked me.  
</P>
<P>
 You may be happy to learn, as I was, that even in this graceless age, a man 
may care about a woman so much that in the moment between his proposal and her 
reply, a hideous chasm may yet open beneath his feet. Whatever cool he thought 
he possessed vanishes in the moment he tells her his fondest wish, and waits 
for her to grant that wish or deny it.  
</P>
<P>
 Look at him sitting there, with sourdough bread crumbs down the front of his 
shirt, a neon gorilla over his shoulder and undisguised terror in his eyes, and 
try not to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like in a Harlequin romance, he's undone by love.

COMMITMENTS; POPPING THE QUESTION; WHILE TRADITION AND ROMANCE STILL REIGN, 
MARRIAGE PROPOSALS OFTEN FALL SHORT OF THE FANTASY -- EVEN, IT SEEMS, AMONG THE 
RICH AND FAMOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Bill asked Hillary, he took the romantic route: "I bought that house you 
like, so you'd better marry me because I can't live in it by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Track star Al Joyner was even more traditional, although it took him seven 
years after meeting Florence Griffith to get down on his knee in the rented 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hef, the almost-eternal bachelor, tested the waters by talking in general 
about marriage to Playmate Kimberley Conrad. Then he popped the question by the 
Playboy Mansion's wishing well. 
</P>
<P>
 A marriage proposal is surely one of a couple's most private moments -- yet, 
much like labor and delivery sagas, it's often too irresistible not to share 
with family, friends and total strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Los Angeles authors Betty Goodwin and Wendy Goldberg set out to 
chronicle the proposals of famous couples, they weren't surprised when only 
three couples begged off (they won't name names). 
</P>
<P>
 After an industrious year of tracking down records, researching and 
interviewing, they had uncovered the courtship stories of 35 legendary couples 
for their new book, "Marry Me!" (Angel City Press, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, the duo found that legendary folks often don't broach the Big 
Question much differently than do everyday types, although the carats and hotel 
rooms cost much more -- an observation confirmed by therapists who counsel 
merging couples. And, no matter how famous or moneyed the couples-to-be, 
proposals can fall short of fantasies and self-imposed deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors also found more tradition than they'd bargained for: Among the 35 
couples, none of the women did the asking. ("That's not to say women weren't 
orchestrating the plan for the gentlemen to ask," quips Goldberg, married for 
22 years to television and movie producer Leonard Goldberg). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some famous folks, like the rest of personkind, found themselves tongue-tied 
or unable to utter the traditional "Will you marry me?" Others danced around 
the question for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the authors found, the type of proposal seems to mirror 
personality type. Roy Rogers, for instance, asked Dale Evans while both were 
astride their horses.  
</P>
<P>
 Lyndon Johnson didn't pussyfoot around. "He came on strong," Goodwin says, 
proposing to Claudia (Lady Bird) Taylor at the end of their first date. When 
she put him off, he kept asking. And won her hand after her father advised her, 
"Some of the best deals are made in a hurry."

 Bruce Willis was the in-control type. He and Demi Moore had gone to Las Vegas 
to see a boxing match. Around 10:30, Bruce told Demi: "I could make one phone 
call to one guy (the hotel's owner) and he could get us married by midnight." 
Moore disappeared to their room to think things over and accepted a little 
while later, recalls Goodwin, a frequent contributor to The Times who got 
engaged while writing the book and is now married.

 Whether a woman is angling for a millionaire or the guy next door, she has in 
mind the ideal proposal, says Kate Wachs, a Chicago psychologist and 
relationship expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women still want romance," Wachs says. "They also want a verbal component. 
They want a guy to go out of his way." It helps if there are flowers, candles, 
a limo, some element of surprise or any combination of these, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Wachs says, women probably expect too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in today's romance novels, proposals have gotten more realistic. Take the 
story of "From Drifter to Daddy," a new Harlequin romance by Mollie Mole, 
president of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Romance Writers of America, who 
writes as Mollie Molay. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, the heroine takes over the care of her niece and nephew -- and their 
ranch -- after her single-parent sister dies. Naturally, the aunt falls in love 
with the day laborer who works on the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The actual proposal starts when he's reading bedtime stories to the kids," 
the author says. The kids offer to ask their aunt for him. Thus prodded, he 
finally turns romantic, finds her in the kitchen and formally asks her to wed. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, there are those real-life proposals that fuel the fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Prutting of Valencia had been dating Mara Quigley for a year and a half, 
spending many evenings on the Staten Island ferry, enjoying the breeze while 
they ate fresh bread and sipped wine. One spring night, most everyone else was 
inside the cabin while they braved the chill on the back of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were sea gulls, stars and the New York City skyline in the background," 
he recalls. The timing seemed perfect. "With my arms outstretched, I got down 
on my knee and said, 'Honey, will you marry me?' " recalls Prutting, now 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Her response was immediate and unforgettable: "Are you joking?" 
</P>
<P>
 Prutting, discouraged but not defeated, didn't skip a beat: "Mara, I'll do 
this one more time." 
</P>
<P>
 He did. 
</P>
<P>
 She came to her senses. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a tear come to her eye and said, 'I would love to.' " That was 12 
years and four kids ago. (In her defense, Mara, 35, explains: "I was a little 
stunned and biding for time. But it was very romantic.") 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Jeff Rose, 31, of Los Angeles, was feeling the pressure. Two 
friends of his girlfriend, Melanie Morris, 29, were getting married. Jeff and 
Melanie had been dating for a year and a half. He hadn't proposed but had 
thought about it. Now, he developed his grand scheme: While they were in 
Chicago for the second wedding, he would propose in front of his grandparents' 
old house.  
</P>
<P>
 Much easier said than done, Rose recalls. First, he had to find a suitable 
hiding place for the diamond, finally settling for an empty dental floss 
container. Then he had to persuade one of Melanie's friends, in town for the 
wedding, not to ride along with them. He had to navigate unfamiliar city 
streets and find the old house. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finally did, he got more enthused than Melanie expected about seeing 
the old homestead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you so excited?" she asked.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because this is where I am going to propose to you," he said, getting down on 
a knee (and then smartly snapping a picture of her accepting the ring with the 
camera he'd conveniently toted). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, women who aren't sure their potential mate carries the romantic 
gene could always do the asking -- Leap Year or not. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a growing phenomenon but still far from common, Wachs says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jana Olson-Collins, 36, of Toluca Lake, readily admits that she proposed to 
her husband of three years, Bill Collins, with whom she worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the car, en route to a business meeting in Orange County," 
Olson-Collins says. "We'd been friends for a year and dating for six months." 
She turned to him and said, "You know, this is such a great partnership." But 
what she also wanted, she told him, was a committed relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 He mentioned living together. She mentioned marriage. He suggested a five-year 
try at marriage, and she's not sure if he was joking or not. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they exited the freeway, "he had said OK," she recalls. Quickly, 
she accepted, saying, "I don't want the five-year deal." 
</P>
<P>
 More commonly, a woman will skirt the issue or drop large hints rather than 
ask outright. One woman recalls telling her beau: "It's OK now if you want to 
ask me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the "point-out-the-options" approach. "My roommate was getting 
married," recalls one Los Angeles woman who had been dating a man for two 
years. So she told her guy: "I am either moving into my own apartment (as in 
'by myself') or I am moving back home." At that point, he said, "Well, well, 
wait a second here," and they got out their calendars to compare schedules and 
set a wedding date. That was 18 years and one teen-ager ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men feel more pressure when the women propose," contends Alvin Baraff, a 
Washington, D.C., clinical psychologist and director of MenCenter Counseling. 
They feel they must respond quickly. "When she proposes, his response is often 
'uh-oh.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it's common, Wachs and Baraff agree, for a couple's timing not to be in 
sync. One will want to marry; the other's not so sure. A few months later, 
their positions can switch. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also common to "try on" the fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people talk about 'what if,' " Wachs says. "As in, 'What if we were 
married . . .' " as a way to ease into a discussion of the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Wachs says, a man will offer what sounds like a proposal -- and the 
woman's not sure if he's kidding or serious. 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably no accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the woman says no," Wachs notes, "you can always say you're just joking."

ATTORNEY LESLIE ABRAMSON TO PEN THE STORY OF HER LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense attorney Leslie Abramson, of Menendez brothers' trial fame, has agreed 
to write her memoirs for a reported $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Simon & Schuster confirmed Friday that Abramson has signed on but 
would not release the financial terms.The figure seems likely, however, since 
several top publishers bid for the memoirs at a New York City auction last 
month, according to Publishers Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 The book will be edited by Alice Mayhew, who has guided several successful 
authors, including journalist Bob Woodward. Abramson, who did not return calls 
to her office, will also have the aid of Miami writer Richard Flatse. A 
publication date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson, 51, defended Erik Menendez in his first trial, which concluded with 
a hung jury last January. She will defend the younger of the two brothers again 
in a second trial set to begin next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 A feisty, frizzled blond known for her tart tongue, Abramson was widely 
praised for her performance in the Menendez trial. She successfully persuaded a 
majority of jurors to view "the boys" as victims of parental abuse and 
deserving of sympathy for the 1989 shooting deaths of their parents, Jose and 
Kitty. 
</P>
<P>
 It's uncertain, however, how much of the Menendez saga will find its way into 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book is about her life. The book is not, principally, about the Menendez 
trial," said a Simon & Schuster representative. 
</P>
<P>
 The book will detail Abramson's life growing up poor in Queens, her years 
slugging it out as a public defender and her efforts to save individuals from 
murder convictions. In 1988, for example, she defended 17-year-old Arnel 
Salvatierra, who was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter -- down from 
first-degree murder -- in the death of his father. Abramson claimed the youth 
was a victim of his father's physical and psychological abuse.

THE CALARTS JAZZ OPEN; MUSICIANS JAM FOR CHANCE AT COLLEGE EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Hey, this is like a jam session," said a young musician, instrument case in 
hand, as he walked into Watts Towers Arts Center on Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 And he was right. At one end of the center's large main room, six jazz players 
were grooving through a spontaneous blues number, tossing choruses back and 
forth with friendly enthusiasm. Other musicians clutching a variety of 
instruments were sprinkled around the audience seats, listening carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way," said David Roitstein, chairman of CalArts' Jazz Department, "it is 
a jam session. Even though we call it an audition." 
</P>
<P>
 As the piece wound to a somewhat ragged, but spirited conclusion, the players 
nodded to each other and shook hands as one or two packed up their instruments. 
Despite their easy musical familiarity, they had just met, brought together by 
a common interest in attending California University of the Arts in Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The audition session -- which was open to all and has taken place annually for 
the last five years at the Watts Center, as well as at Plaza de la Raza in 
Lincoln Park -- was an outreach attempt by the university to make it possible 
for students from inner-city areas to become part of its jazz program. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief break over, the music began once again -- a different blues tune, 
this time -- with a new saxophonist, guitarist and drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous when I first came in," said Zane Musa, the 
saxophonist, a 15-year-old senior from Van Nuys High School. "But when I saw 
that we were going to just be jamming, I felt a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for Musa to make an impact. Whipping his way into a series 
of choruses on alto saxophone, he played with a skill and imagination that 
belied his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting aside his alto, he picked up his tenor and turned to the other 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "How about 'Well, You Needn't?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The Monk tune?" replied one. "Sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking as though every trace of nervousness had departed, Musa played a 
stretched-out solo filled with rapid runs and edgy high notes. Remarkable for a 
musician with his limited experience -- he's been playing for just five years 
-- he managed to push open his improvisational envelope with surprisingly 
off-beat rhythmic accents and avant-garde honks and squeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good one," said Roitstein, watching with a smile. "I'd say he's got an 
excellent chance of making the program after he graduates from high school." 
</P>
<P>
 At the drums, keeping crisp be-bop time behind the younger players, was a 
graying musician whose high school days had clearly ended a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 50 years old," said William Madison, "but they told me there were no age 
limits for these auditions, so here I am. I've played drums on and off since I 
was a kid, and I've worked from time to time as a professional musician. But 
with the kind of stuff I've been through in my life, I never really had the 
chance to study the music -- to fill the gaps, you know? So that's what I'm 
hoping to do now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Musa and Madison represented the outer age limits of musicians auditioning for 
placement in the CalArts undergraduate and graduate jazz program. Most of those 
accepted will be eligible for scholarship support. And those who are members of 
what the university describes as "a traditionally under-represented group" will 
also be considered as candidates for aid from the Charles Mingus Scholarship 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a very wide range of students at CalArts," said Glenna Avila, 
director of the Community Arts Partnership, "some as young as 12 years of age. 
Our primary concern is reaching out to bring in students who would otherwise 
not necessarily have the opportunity to go to college. So we're receptive to 
anyone who can fit into the program." 
</P>
<P>
 As the jam session/audition continued, other musicians joined the group, with 
one or two ringers from the CalArts graduate school occasionally added on piano 
and bass. Guitarist Demetrius Dennis Wilson took the lead, spinning long, 
single-string lines balanced by brisk chording. Nattily dressed, with a slight 
smile on his face, he appeared to be enjoying every moment. And with good 
reason. After having been passed over at last year's auditions, he was back for 
another try, and feeling fine about his playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really important to me," he said. "And this time I'm really ready." 
</P>
<P>
 "Demetrius is one of the rare ones," said Roitstein. "A lot of kids, when you 
tell them they're not quite ready for the program, and suggest some steps they 
should take, they'll say, 'Yeah, sure,' and you never hear from them again. But 
last year, when I told Demetrius that he had to work a little harder in some 
areas, he went right out and did it. He's really come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson agreed. "I knew," he said, "that I had to go out and acquire certain 
kinds of musical nutrients that I needed to lift my playing. I started out 
playing rock and blues and ska music before I came to jazz, so I had a lot to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the quality level of the applicants was very high in general, and 
most of those who participated will receive consideration for admission to 
CalArts. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's approach to jazz -- and to the arts, in general -- differs from 
typical state university programs. Individual development and expression are 
given precedence over academics and large ensemble performance techniques. 
While traditional musical methods are taught, students are encouraged to expand 
their creativity individually and in combination with artists from other 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach would seem to make the program more appealing to students with 
excellent natural skills who may lack traditional scholastic achievements. Yet, 
if there was a disappointment about the auditions, it was the relatively small 
number of minority musicians in attendance, especially given the location of 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate," said Roitstein. "And what we hear from some of our 
students is that young black musicians often simply don't think of going to 
college as a viable option. The other problem is that this generation doesn't 
hear all that much jazz when they're young. They're plenty familiar with rap 
and hip-hop, but jazz isn't that much a part of their listening experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Arts Partnership, which sponsors numerous concerts and workshops 
at area high schools -- with a special focus on the inner city -- is the 
university's prime tool for spreading the word about jazz, as well as to 
advance the possibility of a university education in the field of the arts. 
There already have been some successes. Out of approximately 40 students now 
enrolled in the CalArts Jazz Program, 15 or so are African American, Latino or 
Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just going to take some time," said Avila, "and we know that. We're also 
concerned about the fact that there were no females auditioning today. But 
we're convinced that if we keep on going out there and spreading the word about 
this music, that we will eventually have a mix that reflects the real cultural 
and racial diversity in Los Angeles."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; REVEALING GAYNESS ON TV TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When is it appropriate for a gay man to announce his sexual orientation in 
front of a television camera? 
</P>
<P>
 Is November better than December? January is out because of the Super Bowl. 
But is February better better than March? Naturally April wouldn't do. Already 
too crowded. You know, Easter, National Secretaries Day, the start of Daylight 
Savings. But is May better than June? Forget summertime, which is vacation 
time. Fall brings school. October? What, and be eclipsed by the buildup for 
Halloween? Man, oh man. Is nothing ever simple for our friends in television 
news? 
</P>
<P>
 All right, let's see if we have this right. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett Glaser, who reports on entertainment for KNBC-TV Channel 4, wants to 
acknowledge on the air that he's gay. According to a Times article last week, 
he had hoped to do so in a story especially relevant to the gay community, one 
that was to have run last month. But the story was canceled when other stations 
acquired the ever-coveted list of mini-documentaries Channel 4 planned to run 
during the November ratings sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why would this cause Channel 4 to abort or alter its initial sweeps agenda? 
Don't ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Channel 4's acting news director, Kenny Boles, says there now are no 
"specific plans" for Glaser to use a Channel 4 newscast to announce his gayness 
-- something Glaser has previously acknowledged in print, by the way. But Boles 
says that if Glaser were allowed to declare his sexual orientation in a Channel 
4 newscast -- which Boles regards as "an important thing to do" -- it would be 
something the station would consider for the February or May sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice to see a gay person who's open about his sexual orientation. Even in 
relatively sophisticated Los Angeles, such declarations can harm careers. Yet 
the more who do "come out," the easier it is for other gays to follow suit and 
rip the closet door from its hinges. 
</P>
<P>
 But oh, brother! What Boles appears to be saying is that Channel 4 will allow 
Glaser to affirm his homosexuality in a Channel 4 newscast only during a 
ratings sweeps, one of those monthlong periods of intense audience measurement 
that are crucial to setting local advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the Glaser story, touted as relevant to gays, apparently is 
relevant to gays only during a ratings period. Otherwise, forget it.  
</P>
<P>
 Glaser told The Times he was unconcerned about the change of plans. Boles did 
give Glaser "permission" to acknowledge his homosexuality during an October 
stint on Marilu Henner's syndicated talk show that airs on Channel 4. 
Permission? As if the station owned the airwaves or had the right to veto or 
even regulate Glaser's non-workplace comments about his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think by now, given the publicity his homosexuality has received outside 
Channel 4, that anything Glaser said about his sexual orientation on the air 
would be redundant. In case some haven't gotten the skinny, however, this 
column is ready to assist Glaser in spreading the word. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are a Channel 4 news viewer, read this now: GARRETT GLASER IS GAY! 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, I had planned to disclose my heterosexuality today, but my editors 
at The Times ordered me to delay my announcement until after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 REAL BULL. That characterizes KCOP-TV Channel 13's advertising campaign for 
its again-slender "Real News" at 10 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 After bombing with a costly, over-produced, heavily promoted 10 p.m. hour -- 
in which walk-around anchors and other choreography often overshadowed the news 
-- Channel 13 returned to its former half-hour size last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Old dimensions, new promotional twist. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears the station was only joshing when it touted its previous fatter 
product. After telling viewers for months that its news hour was indispensable, 
Channel 13 now boasts that its latest effort -- a variation of its pre-"Real 
News" half-hour that always badly trailed other 10 p.m. newscasts in the 
ratings -- is even more indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because, say the revisionist ads, it provides the same news as the 10 
p.m. competition in half the time. Saving precious minutes for "Last Call," the 
grating syndicated series that follows. 
</P>
<P>
 You applaud the ingenuity. Now, if only KCOP could think of a way to provide 
the same news in just 15 minutes. Or no minutes. 
</P>

 MR. TUBERHEAD. It turns out that Dan Quayle is not the only one with a 
Potatogate problem. 
</P>
<P>
 John D. Ibson of Claremont writes about my review of the recent "Scarlett" 
miniseries on CBS: "I was astonished and disappointed to see you casually refer 
to Irish country folk as the local potatoheads, a term no less offensive than 
'fag,' 'dago' or similar epithets. . . . As an historian of the Irish American 
experience, I'm especially interested in how persons who aspire to tolerance 
nonetheless feel free to stereotype the Irish quite unbecomingly, in ways they 
would never dream of dealing with blacks, gays or Jews, for example." 
</P>
<P>
 And talk about my double standard, Doris Kelly Cantore of Calabasas noted how 
outraged I'd be if someone on TV "flippantly used insulting and demeaning words 
like 'bagelhead' or 'tacohead' to characterize other groups." 
</P>
<P>
 These are a sampling of the angry responses to my "potatohead" reference; all 
of the callers and letter writers concluding that this Rosenberg guy is either 
prejudiced or flat-out ignorant. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much of a choice. Nonetheless, opting for No. 2, I plead ignorance. Hard 
as it may be to believe, I had no idea that "potatohead" was derogatory. I was 
reaching for a colorful word, and came up with this one, the wrong one. 
Obviously. I shouldn't have used it. Like that spelling monster, Quayle, 
though, I'm educable. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you spell nudnik? H-O-W-A-R-D.

WHY BOTHER TO MAKE REMAKES?; MOVIES: FILMS ARE UPDATED BECAUSE THEY HAVE A 
PROVEN STORY LINE. BUT THEY CARRY A LOT OF BAGGAGE. AND, GENERALLY, THEY DON'T 
DO BETTER THAN ORIGINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD NATALE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remakes have no better track record than original movies. Yet they continue to 
be made. 
</P>
<P>
 For the two redos that worked fairly well in the last year, "Angels in the 
Outfield" and "The Three Musketeers," there were many more that failed big, 
such as "Miracle on 34th Street," "Love Affair," "The Getaway" "Black Beauty," 
"Lassie," "Body Snatchers," "Frankenstein" and "The Browning Version." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, there are a number of remakes already in the pipeline, including "The 
Women," "Sabrina," "Godzilla" and "Dodsworth." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasoning behind remakes is "there's already a solid story there that a 
whole new generation will buy into if it's done correctly," says Tom Sherak, 
distribution head at 20th Century Fox, the maker and distributor of John 
Hughes' new version of "Miracle on 34th Street." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a paucity of good material, that we sometimes -- too quickly -- 
look to material that's worked well in the past," says former Hollywood 
Pictures chief-turned-producer Ricardo Mestres. 
</P>
<P>
 But that straight-line logic is fraught with all kinds of sharp curves, from 
the actual development of the project to selling it to the public. "The fact 
that it's a remake can bring some goodwill," says entertainment attorney Nigel 
Sinclair, "but it's only marginal to the success of the film because audiences 
are always looking for something fresh." Such films as "Speed," "Forrest Gump" 
and, most recently, Disney's "The Santa Clause," became hits because they 
provided a clear alternative to audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of remakes itself isn't necessarily unsound, however. Such 
respected directors as Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford pursued remakes of their 
own movies. Hitchcock made two successful versions of "The Man Who Knew Too 
Much," as did Ford with "Red Dust" and the retitled "Mogambo." Occasionally it 
takes several tries to get it right. John Huston's 1941 version of "The Maltese 
Falcon" was a vast improvement over earlier attempts. Still, some material is, 
by its very nature, sacrosanct. Often, remakes are a damned-if-you-do 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics are more likely to disdain remakes of cherished movies. "There's no 
reason to ever remake a Preston Sturges comedy," says Tom Pollock, chairman of 
Universal Pictures. "It's not possible to do it better. Yet hardly a week goes 
by that someone doesn't approach me with a remake of 'Sullivan's Travels.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor -- rarely given consideration -- says Times movie reviewer 
Peter Rainer, is that the success or failure of many movies has as much to do 
with when they are released as with their content. "If you're just trying to 
recapture the magic, you're almost doomed to fail," he adds. "There has to be 
an overriding reason why it was made." (The same has been true lately of 
sequels. "Star Trek: Generations" being one of the few exceptions.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both "Miracle on 34th Street" and "Love Affair" (and its more recent remake, 
"An Affair to Remember") were perennials with a great deal of residual 
affection. 
</P>
<P>
 A remake of the Christmas film failed, says one executive, because of the 
tenor of the times, which seems to demand that sentimentality be leavened with 
an edge of healthy sarcasm (note: "The Santa Clause"). And "Love Affair" also 
seemed stuck in another era, according to Rainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some compelling reasons on the surface don't always justify doing it 
again. For instance, one studio executive was considering a remake of "Lolita," 
arguing that the 1962 Stanley Kubrick adaptation did not fully explore the 
obsessive pedophilia in Vladimir Nabokov's novel. But, in tackling the material 
more honestly, "we would have made a movie that could be seen as morally 
repugnant, so we passed," says the executive. (The project has since gone into 
development at Carolco Pictures with Adrian Lyne to direct.) 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps best not to have a strong precedent against which to be 
measured. Martin Scorsese's recent "Cape Fear" had a modest pedigree -- the 
original 1962 film, starring Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, was a routine 
bad-guy-versus-good-guy thriller. Scorsese and screenwriter Wesley Strick made 
the good guy (Nick Nolte) more ambiguous and the bad guy (Robert De Niro) 
almost mythically monstrous. "They made it more complicated. And they also had 
more fun within the confines of the original story," says Pollock, whose studio 
released the remake in 1991, grossing about $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign film remakes have a slightly better success ratio (e.g.: "Three Men 
and a Baby" and "Down and Out in Beverly Hills") because the American public is 
usually unaware of the original, says Sinclair. But, even so, there are 
missteps. 
</P>
<P>
 Reworkings of old TV series on the big screen also manage to maximize 
familiarity without breeding contempt -- "The Fugitive," "Maverick" and "The 
Flintstones." On the downside there was "The Beverly Hillbillies." Certain 
larger-than-life themes like the Robin Hood and King Arthur legends, and 
particularly mythic monsters (vampires, werewolves), are generally given good 
grades as remakes. "There's a fascination with those subjects that transcends 
the generations," says Gordon Armstrong of the Entertainment Marketing Group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even these films, Armstrong says, do best when they distance themselves 
from previous versions, both in their making and marketing. "Body Heat" was 
inspired by "Double Indemnity," although was not directly based on it and 
therefore was perceived as a new movie, while the most recent remake of "The 
Postman Always Rings Twice" in 1981 came with all the encumbrances of the past 
film versions. The makers of the new "Godzilla" will be going in the exact 
opposite direction of the cheesy Japanese original -- super-real special 
effects, the best today's technology can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the hope is that creators of such upcoming new versions of "The Women," 
"Sabrina," "The Jungle Book," "Little Women" and "Dodsworth" will bring a new 
twist to these tales, lest they wind up in ever-increasing scrap heap of failed 
remakes.

LIFE IN ANY LANE'S OK WITH EBTG'S WATT; MUSIC: BRUSH WITH DEATH HAS GIVEN THE 
SINGER-SONGWRITER NEW OUTLOOK. DUO PLAYS COACH HOUSE TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All in all, marking his 32nd birthday on tour in San Juan Capistrano instead 
of relaxing at home in England is all right with Ben Watt, half of the pop duo 
Everything But the Girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birthdays have taken on a strange kind of quality in the last couple of 
years, seeing as I nearly didn't have any more," said Watt, who isn't sure how 
he and partner Tracey Thorn will celebrate on Tuesday when they finish a 
two-night stand at the Coach House, the last stop on a 40-date tour, their 
longest-ever performing trek through the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything But the Girl rebounded this year after Watt's almost-fatal bout 
during 1992-93 with Churg Strauss syndrome, a rare disorder in which the 
autoimmune system attacks the body instead of protecting it. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease literally has taken a lot out of Watt, who lost a substantial 
chunk of his digestive track to surgery and saw his weight dwindle from 165 to 
115 pounds as a result of the illness and the restricted diet he has had to 
follow since his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crisis provided Everything But the Girl with plenty of emotional grist 
for "Amplified Heart," its first album of new material since 1991. And it gave 
Watt and lead singer Thorn, who are a couple as well as a musical partnership, 
a special appreciation for being able to count off another year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year's (birthday) was very emotional," Watt said in a recent phone 
interview from a tour stop in Austin. "We had a party at home. I had a lot of 
close friends come around, and there was a lot of reflection on (his brush with 
mortality). I don't think many people have birthdays like that. I felt quite 
moved by it all but very dislocated as well. At least this one will be very 
different." For one thing, he will have 480 fans on hand to wish him well. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his illness -- and Thorn's assumption of responsibility as his primary 
care-giver -- put Everything But the Girl's music-making on hold for about a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wired up in hospital for three months, flat on my back for 24 hours a 
day, unable to move. After that I went home and I was really disconnected from 
the whole routine of writing and performing for about six months before I came 
back on line mentally. Even so, the first few songs I tried to write didn't 
have very much to offer. They were very generic, formulaic songs, things I'd 
said before." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in September, 1993, songs he considered worthwhile "came out in a 
rush," marking his return to effective musicality. Thorn and Watt, who share 
the songwriting, often have drawn on intimate, reflective moods in the course 
of an album discography that dates back to 1984. "Amplified Heart," with its 
subtext of illness and mortality and its stripped-down, folk-based 
arrangements, burrows deep into quiet moments of thoughtful melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
 Watt says they were determined to avoid making a musical diary of his illness. 
What they wanted was to preserve the emotional gist of the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly didn't want to make it self-obsessed. That was the one thing I 
realized early on I mustn't do. If I was to articulate the emotions stirred up 
by the whole experience, I had to make them accessible in a more general form 
that would deal with the uncertainties and vulnerabilities we all feel -- (such 
as) the death of a parent, or a relationship that goes terribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all hit rock-bottom in our lives, where we've had to reassess what's 
very important. I had to take the songs into that territory to make them work, 
because there'd be nothing more sickening than a lot of ER-type dramas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Watt's illness may have interrupted Everything But the Girl's career but it 
didn't deflect the duo from the path it already had begun to follow in recent 
years in performances marked by simplified arrangements and a quiet, intimate 
sound. On such albums as "Baby, the Stars Shine Bright" (1986) and "The 
Language of Life" (1990), EBTG had gone in for record-making with-the-works, 
employing horns and strings on the former and the slick, high-tech sound 
produced by an array of Los Angeles session pros on the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we came to the end of the road in terms of experimenting with ornate 
production techniques," Watt said. "I began to wonder whether that layering of 
texture got in the way of what we were trying to say, whether Tracey wasn't 
more expressive and moving with less surrounding her, whether our songs said 
more with less ornament." Even before Watt's illness, EBTG had gone to an 
acoustic duo format for its live shows, and it has continued to perform as an 
unadorned duo this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Watt and Thorn began working together after meeting as students at the 
University of Hull in 1981. She was a member of an all-female band, the Marine 
Girls, and he had launched a solo career. Both put out albums of their own 
before deciding in 1983 to concentrate on Everything But the Girl. In 1984 they 
embarked on a stylistically diverse series of albums that have incorporated 
everything from cool, lush R&B to touches of rock, country and folk. 
</P>
<P>
 They took their band name from what Watt describes as the "revoltingly cheesy" 
slogan of a furniture shop in Hull that promised it could provide "everything 
but the girl to make your home complete." EBTG's intention, Watt says, has been 
to carry forward the punk rock ethic that calls for shaking up established pop 
formulas, without trying to disguise the fact that Thorn's beautiful and 
emotive alto gives the act a strong basis for traditional pop appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The early '80s in the U.K. were very much about an inversion of sexual 
politics, bands which wouldn't adhere to the myths of rock 'n' roll. If punk 
did anything, it blew the rock 'n' roll myth out of the water and left this 
vacuum where bands were encouraged to draw on (styles of) music that weren't 
specifically rock. Everything But the Girl is an attempt to remain somehow 
contradictory and independent-spirited, (while) making a form of music which 
isn't traditionally regarded as rebellious." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While enjoying occasional chart hits in its home country (Thorn also scored a 
U.K. hit recently as guest vocalist on "Protection," the title song of a new 
album by the group Massive Attack), EBTG remains a cult-level item in the 
United States. Some of its most popular tracks have been renditions of popular 
hits, including songs written by Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper 
and the oft-covered Crazy Horse ballad "I Don't Want to Talk About It." Current 
shows include an acoustic rendition of "Kotton Krown," an uncharacteristically 
romantic number from noise-merchants Sonic Youth that originally appeared on 
the 1987 album "Sister." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm realistic enough to realize that the songs we write naturally aren't all 
that commercial," Watt said (although the current album isn't without its 
contenders: The tense, pining "Missing" brings to mind the Eurythmics of "Here 
Comes the Rain Again;" "We Walk the Same Line," Thorn's warm missive of 
devotion and encouragement to Watt as he struggled with illness, is a 
near-ringer for the dusky Christine McVie-Fleetwood Mac sound). 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it pointless trying to bend what comes naturally to me in a commercial 
direction," Watt continued. "But I do realize there is something commercial 
about our sound. Tracey has a very accessible voice, and I see no problem in 
accessing a mainstream audience sometimes with songs that are more commercial 
than ours." 
</P>
<P>
 * Everything But the Girl plays tonight and Tuesday at 8 p.m. at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Both shows are sold out.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'JUNIOR'S' BABY IS NO JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA BROWN, Laura Brown is a free-lance writer and mother who lives in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found Kenneth Turan's review of the Ivan Reitman comedy "Junior," starring 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, to be as light and fluffy as he claims the film itself 
is ("Arnold's Mommy Syndrome," Calendar, Nov. 23). 
</P>
<P>
 The main objection I had to the film: the worship of technology to the point 
of devaluing human life. For all of its appearance as a comedy, this film puts 
forth the notion that life is and should be under the control of a laboratory, 
and a "mother" is whomever (or whatever) scientists decide it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the impossibility of an embryo growing in a man's abdominal cavity or 
Schwarzenegger's ridiculous "labor pains" as he prepares to give birth. The 
notion that children can and should be created by scientists and grown like so 
many hatchlings in Aldous Huxley's imagined laboratories is put forth as being 
in the proper scheme of things. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Op-Ed piece reports that the National Institutes of Health wants 
government funding to experiment on human embryos. The NIH will be "creating, 
manipulating and then destroying 'developing human life' " in the name of 
research ("A Brave New World Is Hatched," Opinion, Nov. 27). With real-life 
events like this going on, I find Reitman's view of babymaking in the lab, for 
reasons as specious as testing a new drug, to be arrogant and irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 The "experiment" undertaken by Danny DeVito and Schwarzenegger places the 
human embryo in second position, behind the drug being tested. "We made it -- 
we do what we want to with it," is the attitude permeating "Junior," as though 
DeVito just came up with a better computer chip. 
</P>
<P>
 If we can make babies inside any warm repository of tissue, how about in a St. 
Bernard? Is nothing sacred? Reitman shoves his cameras into the most intimate 
of human experiences, the delivery room, and manipulates us with scenes of the 
tearful Schwarzenegger holding "his" newborn. No need to mention that the child 
exists mainly as the byproduct of an attempt to make a bundle in 
pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think Schwarzenegger was offensive in "True Lies," where he kidnaps 
Jamie Lee Curtis and forces her to play the part of a prostitute, he goes even 
further in this movie, showing unparalleled invasiveness in his actions toward 
Emma Thompson. Sure, in the sugary Reitman style, it's all softened in an ooze 
of tearful schmaltz. In the movies, it's apparently OK to plunder someone's 
genes in the name of science. In real life? Let's hope not.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'ALL-AMERICAN GIRL': IS IT GOOD OR BAD TELEVISION?; A POSITIVE 
LOOK AT THE SITCOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP W. CHUNG, Philip W. Chung is a writer who formerly worked on the 
staff of the Korea Times English Edition. He is the co-founder of Yolk 
magazine, a new publication devoted to Asian American entertainment and pop 
culture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After only a handful of episodes of "All- American Girl," ABC's new sitcom 
about a Korean American family starring comedian Margaret Cho, some Asian 
Americans, particularly Korean Americans, had already started their assault 
against the show. From newspapers and talk shows to Koreatown cafes and the 
Asian American boards of computer on-line systems, the criticism was flying -- 
the show's not that funny, the cast isn't Korean, the Korean culture is being 
misrepresented, etc. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I can understand and share the concerns of my Korean American brethren since 
the predominant media image of Korean Americans has tended to be negative, 
usually of the foreign-liquor-store-owner-with-a-gun variety. But "All- 
American Girl" remains one of the few potential bright spots in an otherwise 
bleak landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the show could be improved. Yes, I often cringe when I hear the actors 
attempt to speak Korean. Yes, some of the cultural references are confusing. 
But there's much about the show that is cause for joy. 
</P>
<P>
 The most incredible thing about the series is that it even exists. As anyone 
working in the television industry will tell you, it's nearly impossible to get 
a program on prime-time network television. The fact that a show revolving 
around an Asian American family is on the air is phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the continuing criticism surrounding the program seems to be coming 
from people who feel "All- American Girl" doesn't match their vision of what a 
Korean or Asian American show is. What we need to understand is that this is 
only one program and, therefore, cannot possibly be all things to all people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, on an English-language talk show on Korean radio station KBLA, 
listeners called in with their (mostly negative or less-than-supportive) 
opinions about the show. One point of contention was the accents used by the 
actors. Some listeners felt the use of accents was demeaning and stereotypical 
while others felt they were necessary to add a realistic element to the 
immigrant characters. This example illustrates that no matter how this Korean 
American family is portrayed, there are still going to be those who will be 
unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 No show can single-handedly carry the burdens of an entire community. No one 
looks at the family on "The Brady Bunch" as a representation of all white 
families but, unfortunately, due to a lack of any real Asian American presence 
in the media, "All-American Girl" must become a symbol to a certain degree. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to remember that "All- American Girl" is first and foremost a 
situation comedy, which means its main purpose is to entertain viewers and is 
limited in certain respects. Also, the show's emphasis might be on the more 
"universal" aspects of Korean American culture in order to attract a broader, 
non-Asian audience. Hopefully, as the series builds a strong following, it will 
feel freer to explore more fully the specific issues and concerns that confront 
Asians in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Many successful shows such as "Cheers" and "Star Trek" went through early 
growing pains. Knowing the caliber of the talent involved in "All American 
Girl," particularly with the wonderful Asian American cast members, I have no 
doubt that it can be a potentially groundbreaking series for television in 
general and Asian Americans in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of this show cannot be understated. Depending on how 
successful this series is over the long run, it could open the doors for other 
shows with Asian American perspectives to hit the airwaves, each program adding 
to the complex and diverse tapestry of the Asian American experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, anyone concerned with the representation of Asian Americans in 
mainstream culture should be concerned with "All-American Girl." If something 
about the show strikes us as offensive or grossly inaccurate we should 
constructively let the producers know about our problems but our support for 
the show must be constant. Watch the show, encourage others to watch it, write 
letters letting the producers know what you do or don't like. "All-American 
Girl" can be a defining moment for Korean and Asian Americans. Let's work to 
ensure that it does become that.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'ALL-AMERICAN GIRL': IS IT GOOD OR BAD TELEVISION?; ASIAN 
AMERICANS PUT ON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL Y. HAMAMOTO, Darrell Y. Hamamoto is a lecturer at Cal State Long 
Beach, in the Department of Asian and Asian American Studies. He is the author 
of Monitored Peril: Asian Americans and the Politics of TV Representation 
(Minnesota, 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many others in the diverse Asian American viewing audience, I anxiously 
awaited the debut of "All-American Girl" on ABC starring Margaret Cho, starved 
as we are for substantive representation on prime-time network television. And 
as a student of America's most potent art form -- the situation comedy -- I 
wondered how well the Cho show would fare among competitive programs. Moreover, 
I hoped for a commercially successful program that did not compromise Cho's 
formidable talent as an Asian American performer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its sometimes feeble humor, flaccid gags and prodigious 
underutilization of talent -- B. D. Wong and the other co-stars probably could 
carry a program by themselves -- I found "All-American Girl" to be no more, no 
less banal than most other sitcoms. But what rankles most is the underlying 
assumption that people of Asian descent living in the United States are somehow 
less than "All-American." The very title of the program begs the question. 
</P>
<P>
 In a book I wrote about the relationship between postwar American society and 
the TV sitcom, "Nervous Laughter" (1989), I discuss the proliferation of shows 
beginning in the late 1960s that featured African Americans. Until "Julia" 
appeared in 1968, African Americans had been virtually excluded from TV as 
featured performers. Today, African Americans are actually overrepresented on 
TV, according to a recent report issued by the Center for Media and Public 
Affairs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond their respective superficial differences, 1970s-vintage programs such 
as "Julia," "Sanford and Son," "Good Times," "That's My Mama," "The 
Jeffersons," "What's Happening!!" and "Diff'rent Strokes" attempted to 
normalize and "regulate" a restive African American population after nearly two 
decades of civil rights struggle. Sitcoms such as these helped admit African 
Americans into mainstream society on a "probationary" basis. It might be argued 
that Asian Americans -- currently the fastest-growing immigrant population -- 
are undergoing a process akin to that of African Americans more than 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Asian Americans have become an increasingly foreign-born population 
due to the 1965 revision of national immigration law that once discriminated 
against Asians, it should be kept in mind that Asians have had a productive 
presence in the United States over 150 years. Like immigrants from Europe, 
people of Asian descent have contributed to the vast social wealth of the 
United States for most of the Republic's existence. Yet as each of the episodes 
of "All-American Girl" has dramatized, Asian Americans are still very much on 
"probationary" status. This time it is the fictional Kim family who bears 
responsibility for "normalizing" a diverse group that is beginning to assert 
its presence in institutions that were once the exclusive preserve of European 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surrounding the week of interviews with Judge Lance Ito 
granted to reporter Tritia Toyota of KCBS news notwithstanding, the most 
noteworthy aspect of the broadcasts was that for the first time the viewing 
public was permitted to observe a bright, articulate, witty, compassionate and 
wryly humorous Asian American individual speak for himself without others 
scripting the words, as in "All-American Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Henry Cho does a great job hosting "Friday Night" (NBC) during fringe 
hours (1:30 a.m.) while Johnny Yune presides over a Korean-language program on 
KSCI, but it was the television appearance of Ito that ironically demonstrated 
the virtual absence of Asian Americans capable of speaking for themselves on 
perhaps the most important of communications media. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the program represents a significant step toward democratic 
representation on TV, it is not enough for "All-American Girl" to feature a 
predominantly Asian American cast. For Asian Americans to escape this insidious 
form of social containment, they must gain access to positions where 
substantive decisions are made: producing, writing, directing. But for this to 
occur, the television industry must reform exclusionist practices that prevent 
minorities from occupying such positions.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, the "Hollywood Writers' Report" (1993) commissioned by the 
Writers Guild, West,states that "non-minority writers still account for over 
95% of employment in television." There are few professions so racially 
segregated as TV and film writing. The situation is simply unacceptable in a 
multiracial, democratic society. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho can be applauded for her welcome efforts in making the absurdities of 
Asian American life the basis of her art. (Yes, why is it that Asian Americans 
-- regardless of Asian ethnicity -- always celebrate family occasions at 
Chinese restaurants?) Still, it is the art of the probationer, an adaptive 
strategy derived from continually being pressed to justify one's existence in a 
society where Asian Americans are viewed as a perpetually alien presence. It is 
this undercurrent of anti-Asian racial intolerance that put the parents of 
Lance Ito in a relocation camp for most of the war years. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary media-induced celebrity of Ito should not blind us to the fact 
that even his presence on the bench has little effect on the probationary 
status of Asian Americans so long as exclusionist practices reign in key 
institutions such as those selfsame media industries.

PENTAGON FACES A SHARP NEW CUTBACK IN BASES; MILITARY: PLANNERS FEAR COSTS OF 
POSTS WILL DRAIN FUNDS FOR MODERNIZATION. CALIFORNIA IS CERTAIN TO BE HIT HARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon is preparing to launch another major effort to close down 
unneeded military bases, with signs that this one will be the biggest -- and by 
far the most painful -- in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department strategists believe that this coming round of base closings 
may be the most crucial of all. In drawing down the Cold War military, the 
Pentagon has slashed the total number of troops, but it has not reduced 
infrastructure -- bases and depots -- as sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon budget-makers fear that unless the services get rid of large numbers 
of those unneeded bases this time, they will be stuck with hefty overhead costs 
that will leave them unable to channel money into critical weapons systems and 
modernization programs. 
</P>
<P>
 California, which saw 11 of its major military bases ordered closed in last 
year's round, is certain to be hit hard again, if only because the state still 
has a disproportionate share of bases. About 67 of the nation's 470 remaining 
military installations are in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, as military leaders are painfully aware, this next round of base 
closings may well be their last chance. Congress already authorized 
base-closing efforts in 1988, 1991 and 1993 -- and may not be willing to launch 
another after this one in 1995. The bases left intact may be around for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Gaskin, a former Pentagon strategist, points out that the pain in 
the coming round is likely to be exacerbated by the fact that "all the easy 
choices have been made." The really marginal bases were closed long ago, Gaskin 
said. "Now, we're getting into bone." 
</P>
<P>
 To top it all off, the actual closing of targeted bases has been slower than 
expected -- partly because of delays in environmental cleanup -- and the 
shutdowns so far have yielded far smaller savings than Pentagon policy-makers 
had been counting on. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, planners in all four services are predicting that the 1995 list 
of targeted bases is apt to be the biggest of them all. Former Defense 
Secretary Les Aspin has forecast that it will be "the mother of all base 
closings." 
</P>
<P>
 As has been the case in previous base-closing rounds, the bulk of the 
decision-making will be left to an independent panel known as the Defense Base 
Closure and Realignment Commission, a seven-member body set up to review the 
services' recommendations and make final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, which acts as a sort of insulator and political lightning rod, was 
essentially set up in 1988 as a way to save Congress from itself. Lawmakers, 
unable to face the firestorms that inevitably followed votes on base closings, 
set up the commission and left it with the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the panel comes up with its final recommendations, lawmakers need vote 
only if they want to override the panel's decision. By law, Congress must 
consider the entire package at once -- sparing lawmakers the need to cast votes 
on each base individually. 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers agree that, a few glitches aside, the process has generally 
worked well. Over the years, the commission has ordered the closure of most of 
the bases recommended by the Pentagon. And, by and large, it has kept politics 
out of the base-closing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan J. Dixon, a former U.S. senator from Illinois who will head the panel for 
the 1995 round, said in an interview that he plans to continue the same 
"openness" practices that have stood the commission in good stead with the 
public in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners, for example, will hold public hearings all over the country, 
and they will personally visit every base on the Pentagon's hit list to make 
sure that they have heard all the evidence from local communities that would be 
affected by shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel will deliberate in public in order to avoid any appearance that it 
may have yielded to untoward political influence. (Because the base-closing 
process is largely independent of Congress, the shift of the House and Senate 
to the GOP next year is not expected to affect the outcome.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Dixon said he has no illusions about the challenge facing the panel 
next year. After three previous rounds of base closings, he said, "only the 
hard choices are left. You don't want to be giving away a lot of good bases," 
but the infrastructure must be reduced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon says he also wants to get the commission to consider some 
recommendations for dealing with the increasingly difficult problem of ensuring 
that bases are closed rapidly once the panel has ordered them shut. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent report by Business Executives for National Security, a 
defense-monitoring group, alleged that of the 67 bases the commission has 
ordered shut in the past few years, a third have either never actually closed 
or have reopened for a new government function. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon disputes that report. 
</P>
<P>
 A General Accounting Office study published last month calculated that partly 
because of the slow pace of base closures, the revenue generated by the sale of 
property once used for military bases -- projected at $4.9 billion -- totals 
only $69.4 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon also wants to leave another legacy when the commission's current mandate 
expires -- a set of recommendations on how to handle base closures in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the principal authors of the base-closing legislation, he said he is 
painfully aware that few bases will be shut in the future if the job is left 
entirely to Congress, as it was before the present process was established. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost impossible for a lawmaker to vote to shut a military installation 
in his own district, Dixon said, or to vote against another Congress member's 
bases, knowing that he will be able to vote on yours. "I did my own share of 
squawking," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Dixon nor the Pentagon is willing to speculate on which bases may be 
targeted in the coming round. Defense Department strategists say the individual 
services have not yet completed their own preliminary proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost all analysts are confident that California will once again be in 
the national spotlight. The state has more than twice as many bases as any 
other state, including some big supply and maintenance depots. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few days, the Defense Department will propose any last-minute changes 
in the criteria for deciding which bases to shut. In March, the Pentagon will 
submit specific recommendations, and the commission will begin its own work. 
Final decisions will come next fall. The Base-Closing Process: What Happens

SERBS PERSIST IN HARASSING U.N. PEACEKEEPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.N. soldier trapped by Serbian gunmen in Bosnia's besieged Bihac region 
died of a lack of medical treatment, and rebels thwarted the rescue of a 
hostage peacekeeper with a life-threatening heart condition, U.N. officials 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest evidence of harassment of the U.N. Protection Force -- coming even 
as the Serbs released a token number of peacekeeper hostages -- coincided with 
a visit by the British and French foreign ministers to Belgrade, the Yugoslav 
capital, to warn that U.N. troops may pull out of Bosnia-Herzegovina within 
weeks unless rebel Serbs agree to peace terms. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bosnian Serb gunmen loyal to warlord Radovan Karadzic have made it clear 
that they want the peacekeeping contingent to leave, and they have spurned the 
international community's proposals for a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bangladeshi peacekeeper from among the 1,200 deployed within the besieged 
Bihac pocket died Saturday of a heart attack brought on by bronchial asthma 
that was aggravated by a Serbian blockade of supplies for the troops, mission 
spokesman Paul Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
 One 15-truck convoy was finally allowed into the peacekeeping bases Sunday, 
and U.N. officials were hoping to evacuate the body of the dead soldier with 
the trucks returning to Zagreb, Croatia's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bangladeshi battalion was deployed hurriedly by the U.N. mission in 
October, without adequate food, fuel, medicine or winter clothing, and Serbian 
gunmen had been refusing to allow vital supplies through the surrounding 
territory they hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were clear contributing factors to his death," Risley said of the 
desperate conditions that have resulted from the Serbian blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite repeated pleas for the urgent evacuation from Banja Luka of a 
seriously ill U.N. military observer, Bosnian Serb officials have failed to 
respond to the appeals from U.N. headquarters here, Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb nationalists continued to refuse medical evacuation for the 
unidentified Jordanian officer in Banja Luka whose congenital heart disease has 
been seriously aggravated by his having been used as a human shield against air 
strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Risley said that the ailing 
officer and three others have been forced to lie on the runway at the Banja 
Luka military airfield at least twice when their captors feared that NATO was 
about to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic continued to taunt U.N. officials here by holding more than 350 U.N. 
peacekeepers as pawns in a high-stakes confrontation with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. special envoy for the Balkans, had claimed to have 
obtained Karadzic's promise to release all captive peacekeepers after weekend 
meetings that U.N. sources described as embarrassingly unproductive. Only 53 of 
412 captive troops -- 20 British and 33 Dutch peacekeepers who had been held in 
eastern Bosnia for more than a week -- were released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs and their Croatian Serb allies continued their coordinated 
assault on the U.N.-designated "safe area" of Bihac, and heavy artillery fire 
was concentrated on the northern town of Velika Kladusa, the former power base 
of ousted Muslim warlord Fikret Abdic. 
</P>
<P>
 A quisling for the Serbian nationalists who have occupied all the Bosnian and 
Croatian territory surrounding the Bihac pocket, Abdic has mobilized at least 
5,000 vanquished Muslim supporters from refugee camps and led them into battle 
against the Bosnian government in hopes of recapturing his private fiefdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe took what six months ago was termed a "take-it-or-leave-it" peace 
plan for Bosnia to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to discuss possible 
revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurd told the British Broadcasting Corp. that the U.N. mission might be within 
weeks of a pullout unless the Bosnian combatants end the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will take a little time to do that, but if it fails, then I think lift and 
withdraw -- that is to say, the lifting of the arms embargo preceded by the 
withdrawal of the U.N. forces -- may become unavoidable," Hurd told the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The "leave and lift" option appears to have supplanted "lift and strike," an 
earlier push by the U.S. government to lift the arms embargo shackling the 
Bosnian government and protect endangered Muslims with NATO air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference following his talks with Hurd and Juppe, Milosevic 
reiterated his support for the peace plan. But it remained highly uncertain 
that the Serbian strongman can exert any influence over the Bosnian Serbs, whom 
he armed and instigated but now claims to have cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. reluctance to use force against recalcitrant Serbs for fear that such 
a move would provoke retaliation against peacekeepers has neutralized what 
little clout Western diplomats had to insist on Serbian acceptance of the peace 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal by the five-nation Contact Group -- the United States, Russia, 
Britain, France and Germany -- seeks to bring peace to Bosnia by dividing it, 
with 51% destined for Bosnian government rule and 49% for the Serbian 
nationalists behind Karadzic. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States sent its former special envoy for the Balkans, Charles E. 
Redman, to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, and the rebel stronghold of Pale for 
parallel talks over the weekend. But Redman reported no progress in winning 
Serbian compliance with the peace plan, nor was Washington trying to strong-arm 
the underdog government into making further concessions, said sources familiar 
with the Sarajevo discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs and Croats also escalated their battles along the Bosnian-Croatian 
border over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic has accused the Croatian government of sending troops and equipment 
to back Bosnian Croats in southwestern Bosnia and has threatened to "target 
Zagreb" if the cross-border support continues. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials say they have no firm evidence that the Croatian government is 
involved in fighting in the area of Livno, 30 miles inland from the Adriatic 
Sea port of Split. But the mission has for weeks been denouncing Croatian Serb 
involvement in the assault on Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 In another likely indication of mounting Serbian-Croatian hostility, the 
explosion of a military helicopter at an airfield near Zagreb prompted U.N. 
officials to speculate that the chopper was being used to ferry ammunition to 
the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saturday night blast was heard throughout the Croatian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting between Croatian army troops and Serbian gunmen in Croatia's 
breakaway Krajina region has been steadily intensifying in recent days as 
government forces seek to distract the Krajina Serbs from the Bihac offensive. 
A Mission for Peace 
</P>
<P>
 At least 36 countries have contributed to the U.N. peacekeeping force in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia and Macedonia. Here are some of the nations 
contributing troops: France: 4,489 Britain: 3,405 Jordan: 3,367 Pakistan: 3,017

SIMPSON CASE INFAMOUS BUT INTEREST MAY NOT ENDURE; CULTURE: SEX, RACE AND 
CELEBRITY FUEL FASCINATION WITH THE MURDERS. BUT THEY MAY NOT JOIN CRIMES OF 
CENTURY CATEGORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack the Ripper. Lizzie Borden. Bruno Hauptmann. Charles Manson. Lee Harvey 
Oswald. 
</P>
<P>
 Guilty or innocent, the names of these people have become synonymous with 
crimes so compelling, shocking or gruesome that they fascinate successive 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
 And now comes another so-called Crime of the Century: the O.J. Simpson case, 
in which a Heisman Trophy winner is accused of slashing and stabbing his 
gorgeous ex-wife and her handsome friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Some think this case, like others before it, is rich in "primal archetypes" 
that endure to tell much larger truths about modern existence. Others think 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years from now, the O.J. Simpson case will be a footnote in sports trivia 
questions games," predicted Ronald Allen, professor of constitutional criminal 
procedure at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminologists, legal experts and cultural historians may differ on the 
Simpson case, but they agree that certain crimes transcend their times, 
provoking works of art and scholarly discourses, inspiring conspiracy theories, 
creating cadres of followers. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts say there are several ingredients that move a crime from headlines 
into history books. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the deed itself must be especially brutal, audacious or grisly -- most 
likely the first of its kind. The crime makes us feel vulnerable, because it 
either plays upon primal fears or upsets the social order. It usually involves 
a hero or public figure. And it remains just mysterious enough, despite a trial 
and punishment, to leave the door open for conspiracy theorists and doubters. 
</P>
<P>
 But a crime becomes truly historic when, like an eclipse, its timing brings 
into alignment many profound and often troubling questions about society, say 
the experts. Acting as a prism, the macabre crime has the power to show the 
spectrum of various ongoing struggles in the culture, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Jack the Ripper is not just the story of a 19th-Century killer who 
mutilates the bodies of London prostitutes, but a cautionary tale about the 
unspeakable evils that awaited farmers who moved to the city in Post-Industrial 
Revolution England. Or a grotesque parable of men's physical and political 
subjugation of women. 
</P>
<P>
 The rampage by Manson's followers in Benedict Canyon becomes Middle America's 
worst nightmares about moral breakdowns among the free love generation in the 
1960s. The Leopold and Loeb case becomes the triumph of arrogant depravity over 
genius and advantage during the uninhibited 1920s Flapper Era. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is there have been quite a number of 'crimes of the century,' " 
said Paula Fass, professor of social and cultural history at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "In each case, the crime seems to encapsulate something about the particulars 
of the time that make people want to describe it in those terms," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some heinous acts are unquestionably in a class by themselves: War crimes such 
as Auschwitz and assassinations such as that of President Kennedy change 
history as well as define it by transcending contemporary politics to live on 
in the popular imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside that realm, among the most enduring cases is that of Lizzie Borden, 
the spinster acquitted of hacking her tightwad father and overbearing 
stepmother to death with an ax in 1892. At the time, the crime served as a 
touchstone for society's struggle over the virtue of family life and the nature 
of women. It played out conflicts between suffragettes and the Victorian notion 
that women are frail innocents who should be protected, said Cal State 
Fullerton professor Wayne Hobson. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1930s, however, the public consensus was that Borden had committed the 
murders but her actions were only Freudian payback for a repressive father, he 
said. In the 1970s, Borden became a feminist icon, striking out against 
sex-based limitations. Now there's a theory she took revenge against a father 
who molested her and a stepmother who covered it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lesbian angle for a while, that she was caught in a tryst with 
another woman," said Hobson, who has taught a course on "Images of Crime and 
Violence in American Culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Borden's symbolic power has earned the crime a cult-like following, spawning 
28 books, two operas and one ballet (choreographed by Agnes DeMille). Two years 
ago, more than 500 scholars and enthusiasts gathered in Fall River, Mass., to 
mark the centennial of the crime with a conference, hosted by a local community 
college instructor who edits a Lizzie Borden quarterly for 700 subscribers in 
seven countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may be hard to imagine in the midst of the media frenzy over the 
Simpson case -- more than 10,600 stories have been published about it in 147 
newspapers -- some believe that it will never come close to sustaining such 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I would pick up a textbook 30 years from now, would (the Simpson case) 
appear in the book? Probably yes," said UC Berkeley's Fass. "Would there be 
more than two sentences? Probably not." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Bugliosi, the former Los Angeles deputy district attorney who 
prosecuted Manson and his followers before writing a best-selling account of 
the killings, said the Simpson case is hardly worth a serious book. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will always be a famous case, but I don't perceive it as a case where the 
interest is sustained throughout the years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that will last is, 'God, can you imagine what happened to this 
guy, O.J. Simpson?' But how do you write a book about something like that? It 
(the crime) is so circumscribed." 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, these observers say, the Simpson case will go the way of Roscoe 
(Fatty) Arbuckle, the silent-screen comic who was drummed out of Hollywood 
after his acquittal in the 1921 death of a 25-year-old model who had been raped 
and killed during one of his orgiastic parties. At the time, the Arbuckle case 
was big news, with its lurid accounts of debauchery, but it has faded from 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet others predict the Simpson case will endure because the horrific double 
murder on Bundy Drive pushes society's hot buttons -- race relations, 
interracial romance and domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the case will be remembered for the same reasons people remember the 
Lindbergh baby kidnaping and murder -- celebrity and media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniably one of the world's most widely recognized and beloved figures of 
the century, Lindbergh was the universal object of sympathy when his child was 
abducted in 1932. If this could happen to Lucky Lindy, people reasoned, it 
could happen to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the interest, the criminal investigation, arrest of Hauptmann 
and his trial in the hamlet of Flemington, N.J., drew unprecedented attention 
-- in part because of the escalating competition between newspapers and the 
emerging power of radio, which beamed live bulletins about the legal 
proceedings to foreign continents. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the competition is between newspapers, radio and tabloid television. 
And the added wrinkle isn't that a celebrity is involved, but that a celebrity 
is the one facing murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never before in American culture has a crime this serious been suspected of a 
celebrity this big," said Jay Rosen, a media critic at New York University. 
"There have been bigger celebrities caught in the media maw, and there have 
been equally big crimes, but I don't think there has been such a combination of 
those two factors." 
</P>
<P>
 To Frank McConnell, UC Santa Barbara English professor and author of several 
detective novels, the Simpson tragedy imitates art too closely to be forgotten. 
The point hit home, he said, when he sat transfixed by television coverage of 
police cars following the white Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned to my wife and said, 'The next time I teach 'Othello,' I'll have to 
talk about this,' " recalled McConnell. "At the end, Othello confesses his 
guilt and slits his own throat. O.J. takes that long ride with Al Cowlings." 
</P>
<P>
 McConnell said the improbability of Simpson's fall from grace also strikes a 
deep chord. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Jack the Ripper incarnates our fears about the big city, if Lizzie Borden 
incarnates our fears that the traditional small-town family may be evil at its 
heart, and if Charlie Manson incarnates our fears that the younger generation 
may not be the young visionaries but small boys with long knives . . . then 
O.J. incarnates our fears that the most distinguished and beloved may 
themselves be capable of evil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Temple University, psychology professor Sonja Peterson-Lewis got a glimpse 
of the crime's symbolic power when she was forced to abandon plans to use the 
murder case to teach her students how to construct a simple questionnaire for 
psychological surveys. The thought of writing some questions with the 
assumption Simpson was guilty evoked strong emotions among the mostly African 
American students, many of whom argue vehemently that the football star had 
been framed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not O.J. the person. It's O.J. the idea," she said. "There's an 
identification, and in some cases over-identification, with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my students have been stopped by police and accused of something they 
did not do," she said. "I've had students leave home an hour and a half ahead 
of time to allow for the possibility that they were stopped by police and asked 
for identification." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson-Lewis said the incident has prompted her to research why people 
believe Simpson is guilty or innocent, the conclusions of which she will 
present as moderator of a Popular Culture Assn. panel scheduled to discuss the 
implications of the case in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Her co-moderator, University of New Mexico professor Jane Caputi, said the 
case has become a "myth narrative," playing out sexist and racist instincts of 
the culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the fusion of sexism and racism," said Caputi, a feminist historian 
who has written about Jack the Ripper. "O.J. and Nicole somehow act out a 
paradigm of what sexist America believes to be Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, she said, becomes the racist stereotype of brutal, lascivious, black 
masculinity. Nicole, she said, personifies the racist notion of the blonde 
bombshell -- "the ultimate thing" -- to be possessed. 
</P>
<P>
 On a different level, others say, it will be the mystery of exactly what 
transpired between O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson that will keep pulling 
people back into the story like some kind of psychological undertow, whatever 
the jury decides. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as Simpson continues to say that he is innocent . . . it will go on 
for a long, long time," predicted Stuart M. Kaminsky, author of popular 
detective novels and Florida State University film professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he says he's guilty, it's pretty much over. There will be new headlines 
in the Enquirer." The Simpson Case

COLUMN ONE; YAROSLAVSKY TURNS A NEW PAGE; THE SAVVY L.A. COUNCILMAN HAS EVOLVED 
WITH THE CITY OVER THE COURSE OF 19 YEARS. TODAY HE JOINS THE COUNTY BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS MUCH AS HE JOINED THE COUNCIL -- AS A REFORMER.

<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky stands amid the packing boxes and the political trophies, 
preparing to leave behind Los Angeles City Hall -- the setting over the past 19 
years for his transformation from shaggy-haired political upstart to consummate 
political insider. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, 45, is embarking on a short but important journey -- for himself 
and for the world of local politics. The councilman's trip up the hill to take 
a seat today on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors -- a powerful but 
often insulated and sluggish body that Yaroslavsky aims to shake up -- means 
saying goodby to the institution where he earned fame, influence and access. 
</P>
<P>
 Crammed into the packing boxes are photos of Yaroslavsky with President 
Clinton, Yaroslavsky with ex-LAPD chief Daryl F. Gates, Yaroslavsky with two 
prime ministers of Israel, Yaroslavsky with the Queen of England, Yaroslavsky 
with Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would have ever thought that a 26-year-old kid, three years out of 
college, would have had the opportunity to play as large a role as I have in 
running the second largest city in the United States?" Yaroslavsky muses. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with savvy, ambition and the solid support of the Jewish community that 
elected him, Yaroslavsky was more often than not a dominant player in virtually 
every municipal initiative of note since he joined the City Council in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 His evolution in many ways has mirrored the city's own. 
</P>
<P>
 In his early days at City Hall, a black liberal mayor backed by a powerful 
black-Jewish political alliance was itching to take on the Police Department -- 
a deeply conservative institution with a powerful political machine of its own. 
Yaroslavsky, fresh from his days as a student activist at UCLA, joined the 
forces pushing for change in the LAPD and made a name for himself as someone 
not afraid to tangle with then-chief Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, as rampant development emerged during the high-flying 1980s, 
Yaroslavsky made that his issue, ultimately co-sponsoring a successful ballot 
initiative to curb development citywide. His reputation grew -- although some 
pointedly noted that big developers were among his largest contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Yaroslavsky's considerable ambition, the mayor's office eluded him. He 
seriously considered running against Tom Bradley in 1989 but decided against 
it. Four years later, after the municipal landscape had been transfigured by 
the riots and by Gates' departure and Bradley's impending retirement, 
Yaroslavsky again declined a chance to try for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it went to Richard Riordan, a Republican venture capitalist who won 
on the slogan "Tough Enough to Turn L.A. Around." 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the maturing Yaroslavsky, sensing the power of the purse, had 
reinvented himself as the council's budget czar -- a key position as the 
economy went bad, and hard-nosed pragmatism became a prized municipal virtue. 
Now the insider, he inveighed against term limits and laid the groundwork for 
establishing a family political dynasty by backing another Yaroslavsky, his 
wife, Barbara, to take over his City Council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 As he moves to the Board of Supervisors today, Yaroslavsky enters a new 
incarnation -- assuming again the mantle of a reformer, vowing to take on a 
massive and entrenched bureaucracy and open its secretive practices to greater 
public oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky's political artistry -- one part media mastery, one part 
fund-raising prowess, one part instinct for shifting realities -- has been 
widely recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 At Yaroslavsky's going-away party, Mayor Riordan gave him a copy of that 
classic treatise on the dark art of politics, Machiavelli's "The Prince." 
Everyone laughed. "It was like carrying coals to Newcastle," quipped one City 
Hall aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky could be found in the City Hall pressroom more often than any 
other public official, sometimes trying out comments on a topical municipal 
issue in a blatant attempt to get quoted in a news story. 
</P>
<P>
 And it worked. A computer review found that Yaroslavsky's name appeared in 
almost 3,500 separate articles published in The Times over the past ten years. 
By contrast, John Ferraro, the council's president during most of that same 
period, was mentioned in 2,200 articles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the master of the sound bite," Ferraro said. "If he went to your news 
conference, before long he'd make it his news conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's gift for raising campaign money was helped by the fact that his 
district was a hot spot of development during the 1980s and that his 
constituents are some of the city's most affluent residents. 
</P>
<P>
 He also brought a certain dedication to the task. He would attend a 
fund-raiser for another politician and quickly begin working the contributors' 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
 His passion for politics -- and for sensing which way the wind was blowing -- 
sometimes took on an air of low comedy. On at least one Election Day, 
Yaroslavsky accompanied his staffers as they rummaged through trash bins at 
polling places to retrieve the discarded sample ballots of voters who had 
marked the booklets to guide them in voting. From the marked sample ballots, 
Yaroslavsky had his own exit poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine anyone doing this just to get an idea of the results only a 
few hours earlier?" said one City Hall aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes his passion for winning the political game got him into trouble. 
Earlier this year, the councilman was discovered tearing down a street-side 
campaign sign of his main opponent in the supervisor's race. The incident 
proved a wholly unnecessary embarrassment given the fact that Yaroslavsky was a 
shoo-in in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, Yaroslavsky's moves are far subtler. Even opponents have admired his 
keen sense of political timing. 
</P>
<P>
 After being elected to the Board of Supervisors in June from a district with a 
much larger San Fernando Valley base than his council district, Yaroslavsky 
surprised some when he told an interviewer how much he admired the curmudgeonly 
ex-Councilman Ernani Bernardi -- a beloved political fixture in the Valley, 
although in some ways Yaroslavsky's antithesis. 
</P>
<P>
 "My jaw dropped to the floor when I read it," said a former colleague. Pure 
calculation, speculated another City Hall veteran, designed to smooth 
Yaroslavsky's way politically as he prepared to represent a constituency where 
Bernardi was popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say Yaroslavsky's style transformed the chairmanship of the City 
Council's Budget and Finance Committee into a powerful and highly coveted post. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a function of personality as much as position," noted Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong personality who placed himself at the center of big municipal issues, 
Yaroslavsky has not been without critics and foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, who butted heads with Yaroslavsky during the 1980s, declined to 
return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-chief Gates labeled Yaroslavsky "nothing but a politician -- who played to 
the masses." 
</P>
<P>
 Another high-ranking City Hall veteran said: "He could demagogue with the best 
of them, and he could play righteous indignation better than most." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were working with him, he was a powerful ally. If against him, he was 
a formidable foe," said Councilman Joel Wachs, a onetime adversary who 
nevertheless admires Yaroslavsky's talents. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of immigrants, Yaroslavsky spent his early years in Boyle Heights. His 
mother died when he was 10. His parents taught him to give back to the 
community, he said, explaining his entry into public life. Others think it may 
have grown out of a large appetite for attention, a need to feel important and 
rub shoulders with the rich and famous while influencing the course of events. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all like that, but Zev's appetite was bigger," said one of the city's 
top officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's own assessment as he leaves City Hall: "I don't want to sound 
vainglorious, but no moss has grown on my rear-end here. For better or worse, I 
made things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 His involvement took him overseas. He relished his official trips to Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union, where history was in the making as 
countries there emerged from decades of Communist rule. He rolled up his 
sleeves, acting as an election observer in Romania and as an adviser to newly 
elected city officials in Russia and the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same vein, Yaroslavsky clearly enjoyed the access to legendary figures 
that his post afforded him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members were regularly invited to the famous birthday parties 
of late industrialist Armand Hammer, Yaroslavsky was "disinvited" for years as 
he led the fight against Occidental Oil's plans to drill in Pacific Palisades. 
Later, when Hammer asked for Yaroslavsky's help in winning approvals for his 
Westwood museum, Yaroslavsky used the occasion to work his way back onto the 
guest list. He chuckles as he recalls finagling a lunch with former Nixon aide 
Bob Haldeman to talk about the Watergate years. (The date was made as Haldeman 
sought Yaroslavsky's backing for a zoning variance in Westwood for a client.) 
</P>
<P>
 For all his sharp instincts, some say, Yaroslavsky sometimes missed the mark 
at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes his economic views did not square well with a business agenda," 
said Ray Remy, executive director of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, 
citing Yaroslavsky's anti-development actions and his support for taxes that 
fall heavily on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just didn't get it -- that there's been a fundamental shift and that Los 
Angeles is no longer a competitive urban market," said a prominent lobbyist for 
business interests. "But it's due in part to the fact that Zev's never been in 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton political science professor Raphael Sonenshein, a student 
of Los Angeles politics, said that Yaroslavsky, while thoughtful on the issue 
of the historic liberal alliances between blacks and Jews, never actually built 
a solid bridge to the black community himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Others fault Yaroslavsky for not living up to his early billing as a reformer 
and champion of the underdog. "I haven't seen the reformer," said 
Ridley-Thomas, who represents South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 To Ridley-Thomas, that was apparent when Yaroslavsky fought a plan to shift 
city housing funds to the central city, at the expense of Yaroslavsky's white, 
middle-class constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, he put his not inconsiderable talents to bad use . . . to 
divide the city and strain relations between communities," Ridley-Thomas said 
of the housing funds fight -- which Yaroslavsky won. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To win his first City Council election in 1975, Yaroslavsky -- a Hebrew 
schoolteacher and leader of a Soviet Jewry group -- had to beat Fran Savitch, a 
member of Mayor Bradley's inner circle and the favorite of the affluent-liberal 
Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yaroslavsky walked precincts and endeared himself to the older, 
middle-class Jewish residents of the Fairfax district -- many of them recent 
immigrants -- and scored an upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, Yaroslavsky was embroiled in several popular crusades of the day 
that, in retrospect, show how Los Angeles and Yaroslavsky have changed over 
nearly two decades. Those fights included his support for killing a plan to put 
a diamond lane for car-pooling commuters on the Santa Monica Freeway and his 
opposition to an unpopular and hugely costly federal program to require the 
city of Los Angeles to stop dumping sewage sludge in Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was on the police issue that he made his strongest mark. 
</P>
<P>
 A product of 1960s campus skepticism about law enforcement, Yaroslavsky 
tangled with the LAPD over police spying on dissident groups, including his own 
Southern California Council on Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Yaroslavsky championed a plan to end the use of the chokehold by police 
amid growing evidence that the restraint was being used to deadly effect mostly 
against blacks. The chokehold controversy in some ways foreshadowed the city's 
painful encounter with police brutality after the 1991 beating of Rodney G. 
King was televised around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky began to see himself as mayoral material. He started building a 
massive campaign war chest, hoping that Bradley would be elected California's 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Bradley failed in races for governor in 1982 and 1986, Yaroslavsky 
prepared to challenge him head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky tapped into the powerful quality-of-life fears of the city's 
middle-class homeowners, who felt that their neighborhoods were imperiled by 
the traffic and aesthetic incursions of the 1980s commercial building boom. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman drew on credentials he established in 1986, when he and 
Councilman Marvin Braude unveiled Proposition U, a bold measure to trim 
development citywide that handily won in the face of tepid opposition from 
Bradley and the city's business and labor interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the summer of 1988, a memo to Yaroslavsky from Michael Berman, his 
political adviser in the mayor's race, was leaked to The Times. The memo's 
observations -- that Bradley was not bright and that Yaroslavsky should lean 
heavily on his wealthy Jewish connections -- caused an uproar about the dangers 
of ethnic stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcry forced Yaroslavsky to dismiss Berman, leaving his fledgling 
campaign without a guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Bradley turned the anti-development tables on Yaroslavsky, whom 
neighborhood groups thought was too soft on a plan to expand the Westside 
Pavilion. Bradley stepped in and blocked part of the project. The move signaled 
that the mayor -- with the support of homeowner activists -- was ready to 
aggressively challenge Yaroslavsky's anti-growth credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 By January, 1989, Yaroslavsky had decided -- after seeing a poll that showed 
Bradley's popularity was remaining constant -- to abort his run for the mayor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a low-water mark. Yaroslavsky still had substantial power as chairman 
of the budget committee, but during the tough economic times that started in 
the late 1980s, the city's budget-making process has involved a constant, 
joyless tightening of the screws. 
</P>
<P>
 People remarked that Yaroslavsky seemed frustrated and bored. Yet in 1993 
Yaroslavsky again decided not to run for mayor. Some say it was a failure of 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 He toyed with the idea of taking on Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, 
privately boasting that he thought he could beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end he was spared such a clash and given an opportunity to escape 
the confines of City Hall when Edelman unexpectedly decided to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 Council President Ferraro was with Yaroslavsky in Tokyo when they got the 
news. They had planned to fly back to Los Angeles in two days, but Yaroslavsky 
-- anxious about losing even a moment's opportunity -- got on the next 
available plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro savored the memory: "I think he would have swum back if he hadn't got 
that earlier flight." 
</P>

U.S. UNVEILS SCIENCE CLASS STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Influenced by reforms long under way in California, a group of prominent 
scientists and educators has unveiled the first national standards for science 
education that they hope will transform the teaching of a subject that relies 
too heavily on textbook learning and rote memorization. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem in the nation's public schools is that they have "not enough 
science -- and it's the wrong kind of science," said Bruce M. Alberts, chairman 
of the National Research Council in Washington, which oversaw the development 
of the standards. "Drills and learning science words are what schools do now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about science as a process of inquiry. We want it to be problem 
solving, not just a recitation of terms." 
</P>
<P>
 The draft document, in the works for three years, urges educators to teach 
more science in the elementary grades and change the way they teach middle and 
high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 It sets priorities for what students ought to learn by the end of the fourth, 
eighth and 12th grades, and establishes standards for training teachers and 
designing tests that will measure whether students have developed a deep 
understanding of scientific concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by a 38-member panel whose work was funded by $6.5 million in federal 
grants, the standards will be the subject of nationwide reviews before becoming 
final next year. As voluntary standards, they are intended to serve as a guide 
for school districts that want to upgrade science teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 The standards were developed as part of a larger national movement set in 
motion by President Bush and embraced by the Clinton Administration to define 
how students should be taught and what they should learn in a wide range of 
subjects. Standards have been developed for mathematics, arts, geography and, 
most recently, history. 
</P>
<P>
 The history standards, released in October, riled political conservatives, who 
said the guidelines slighted familiar historical figures such as Ulysses S. 
Grant and the Wright brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft science standards, released last week, recommend teaching about 
evolution theories starting in the fifth grade but do not directly address the 
sensitive issues of whether creationist beliefs should be included in the 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines urge teachers to show students the connections among the 
sciences and link other disciplines, such as mathematics and writing, to 
science learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberts and other experts say the standards will mean substantial 
readjustments in the thinking of the nation's science teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest challenge teachers face is overcoming all of the socialization 
they had in thinking about what science learning is," said UCLA education 
professor Jeannie Oakes, who helped write the standards. "Science has 
traditionally been something you learn about; teachers teach about science. 
Instead, we should think of science learning as a way to . . . (create) 
understanding of the world we live in." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the guidelines will prompt little change in the way science is 
taught. Teaching science as a process of inquiry is already the guiding 
principle of the state's science framework, adopted in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started the hands-on movement long before so many other states did," said 
David Hammond, head of the science and environmental education unit of the 
state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the nation's schools today are not teaching in accord with the new 
science standards, its authors say. Most schools do not ask students to 
actively engage in scientific inquiries that they consider important or 
interesting, and consequently, too many youngsters never achieve a deep enough 
understanding of scientific concepts to apply them to daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberts cites the Pasadena Unified School District's science education program 
as an exemplary exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Pasadena schools launched a collaboration with Caltech to overhaul 
its methods of science teaching. Adopted districtwide in 1990, the program 
encourages teachers and students to cast off textbooks as the focus of learning 
and engage in a more hands-on approach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth grade, for example, students spend a full quarter -- about eight 
weeks -- immersed in experiments with batteries and volts. "Instead of saying, 
'Here is an electrical circuit and this is what it does,' the teacher says, 
'here're some batteries, set up a circuit and a switch and see how the whole 
thing works,' " said Jennifer Yure, the district's science education 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher finds out "what students think they know and what they would like 
to know. Then students design the experiments. And they end up with a 
conceptual understanding of electricity," Yure explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a different approach to teaching -- more of an inquiry approach, where 
the teacher helps facilitate the question rather than answering the question," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The big difference Yure said she and other teachers have noticed since the 
inquiry methods were deployed is that students' natural curiosity has been 
kindled. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started, the older children were afraid to ask questions, afraid to 
raise their hand. Now, when we look at students who have been in the program 
since the beginning, there aren't many questions they are not willing to sit 
down and figure out. It's opened the door to them becoming critical thinkers." 
</P>
<P>
 California has also been a leader in developing new tests to measure science 
learning. Called performance-based or authentic testing, the science tests 
require students to perform experiments that demonstrate their mastery of basic 
concepts. For instance, to gauge understanding of force and friction, a student 
might be given a toy dump truck and some weights and asked to determine how 
much weight is needed to pull the truck over a smooth road versus a gravel 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Another portion of the exam is called the enhanced multiple choice, in which 
students not only have to pick an answer from several options but write why 
they think their answer is the best one. About 390,000 fifth-graders have taken 
the new science tests and the results are scheduled for public release later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The new tests are more time-consuming, lasting 15 to 30 minutes longer than 
the ones used previously. But state education officials say they are pleased 
with the results so far and hope that the national standards will boost support 
in California for the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Most teachers feel pressure to "teach to the test," no matter what the 
subject. So a new test will "help drive the right kind (of science teaching)," 
said Kathy Comfort, science assessment consultant for the California Learning 
Assessment System, or CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 The science test is one in a series of new subject-area exams the state has 
developed that have been beset by controversy. The recent administration of the 
language arts CLAS test brought charges that it contained questions that were 
too personal, too political and too vague and led state officials to cancel 
funding for the tests next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The crafters of the national standards agree that new forms of assessment are 
key to fueling fundamental change in the way science is taught. The traditional 
reliance on tests that ask for short answers and on multiple-choice formats 
tends to reward rote learning and memorization, and experts say that is a major 
reason why improvements in science education will take time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is enormous tradition and inertia" in science teaching, said Bill 
Aldridge, executive director of the National Science Teachers Assn. "What these 
standards will do is assist the reformers. It is a very powerful device. And if 
it causes the test makers to change the tests, that will help." 
</P>
<P>
 Retraining teachers in the new methods is also critical. In California, there 
are a variety of government and privately funded initiatives to bring knowledge 
of the reforms to the trenches of public education. The Pasadena school 
district, for example, has received a National Science Foundation grant to 
train 14 other school districts in the inquiry method over the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, California educators acknowledge that the state, even with its head 
start, has a long way to go. Many teachers remain loyal to the old ways of 
teaching science. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in a process of major transformation," said UCLA's Oakes. "In 
California, people have come to view science education in a very different way. 
But the enormity of the task of making those changes in daily practice, behind 
classroom doors, is very different."

DRILLING ADVANCE REKINDLES SANTA BARBARA OIL WARS; ENERGY: MOBIL WANTS TO 
REMOVE OFFSHORE RIG, USE NEW METHOD TO BORE BENEATH OCEAN FROM COAST. FOES CRY 
FOUL.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since the world's first offshore oil well was dug at the end of a 
Summerland pier a century ago, residents here have been battling big oil. 
</P>
<P>
 All around are reminders of their defeats: Unsightly oil platforms dot the 
ocean. In some places, the faint odor of petroleum wafts through the air. Tar 
seeps from the sea floor and lingers on beaches. And many people still recall 
the 1969 Union Oil spill that spewed 4.2 million gallons of crude into the 
ocean, killing birds and contaminating beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, casting itself as a protector of the marine environment, Mobil Oil Corp. 
is proposing to use new land-based technology to recover oil from a coveted 
offshore deposit that is closed to ocean drilling. Using new "extended reach" 
techniques, Mobil wants to bore wells on the UC Santa Barbara campus and burrow 
under the ocean to reach the oil field two miles from shore. 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, Mobil's plan could set a precedent and open the California 
coastline to new onshore oil operations, with companies drilling horizontally 
under the sea floor as far as three miles to extract offshore petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would basically open up a new generation of oil and gas development off 
our coast," protested Linda Krop, a lawyer with the Environmental Defense 
Center in Santa Barbara. "We don't want to see drilling from onshore." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argue that land-based drilling for oil off Santa Barbara County 
would mean development of a major industrial facility, with a 17-story drilling 
tower and accompanying potential toxic hazards near a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil officials, however, say the new directional drilling method would allow 
the recovery of valuable oil without the possibility of offshore spills. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling its proposal "Clearview," Mobil has offered to remove an aging oil 
platform -- long an eyesore off UCSB and its student enclave, Isla Vista -- in 
exchange for permission to drill. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also promises to build a new pipeline to transport its oil to a 
Torrance refinery and halt the riskier practice of barging the product. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the amount of reserves we can produce, it's good for Mobil, 
it's good for the county, and it's good for the whole state," said Shauna 
Clarke, the Mobil official heading the effort. "The state and the county will 
have the revenue, and it will eliminate the possibility of an offshore spill." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mobil's proposal, to be unveiled formally early next year, sets the stage 
for renewed battle over offshore oil just as opponents in Santa Barbara 
believed they had something to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature designated all state 
waters -- which extend three miles from shore -- as a sanctuary where no new 
offshore drilling will be allowed. In addition, some offshore platforms are 
nearing the end of their useful lives and will soon be removed, beginning next 
year with four rigs off southern Santa Barbara County that will not be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sanctuary law does not ban drilling under the ocean from land. And 
Mobil may benefit from a conservative shift in key government agencies produced 
by the 1994 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Barbara County, for example, pro-business candidates won a majority 
on the Board of Supervisors this year. And with Republicans taking charge of 
the state Assembly, the GOP is expected to control a majority of the Coastal 
Commission for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there is going to be more of a shift toward pro-business after the 
beginning of the year," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Human use of the region's oil deposits dates back thousands of years to Native 
Americans sealing their boats with tar. The first commercial development began 
in 1890 with an asphalt mine where the university now stands. 
</P>
<P>
 The first protests over "desecration" of the coastline came in 1896, with 
construction of the first offshore wells at Summerland. Two decades later, 
drilling from piers at Ellwood 20 miles west sparked renewed outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was protest right from the beginning (of offshore drilling)," said Bob 
Sollen, a retired Santa Barbara reporter who is writing a book on the history 
of offshore oil. "It was a mess because there were no regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcry over the offshore operations at Summerland and Ellwood ultimately 
led to the state's first offshore sanctuary in 1955, protecting a limited area 
off the coast of Santa Barbara between the two oil fields. Although only 
vestiges of the piers still stand, contamination at Summerland and Ellwood 
remains, Sollen said. 
</P>
<P>
 As technology improved in the 1960s, oil companies began building offshore 
platforms out beyond the protected area. When Union Oil's offshore well blew 
out in 1969, it created one of the nation's worst environmental disasters and 
helped ignite the modern-day environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil, which proposes basing its operation on sites left from the heyday of 
the Ellwood Field, acknowledges that the region is one of the most hostile to 
oil development in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we thought it was crazy to go into Santa Barbara," said Ken Miner, a 
Mobil operations manager. But the possibility of extracting the oil without 
drilling offshore was intriguing enough to persuade Mobil to try. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was the brainchild of Charles Warren, a longtime Democratic 
assemblyman from Los Angeles who helped draft the state's Coastal Protection 
Act in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 As executive director of the State Lands Commission, which oversees offshore 
oil drilling, Warren envisioned a trade-off that would recover oil, produce 
government revenue and remove Platform Holly, the rig perched since 1966 off 
UCSB and Isla Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading how the new high-tech wells could recover oil at great 
distances, Warren said he realized the technique could be used to reach 
offshore oil anywhere within the state's three-mile limit, and he brought the 
idea to Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means we don't have to build platforms offshore," Warren said. "And any 
risk of oil spills offshore could be eliminated if we could find acceptable 
sites onshore." 
</P>
<P>
 While familiar with Santa Barbara's resistance to oil drilling, Warren said it 
was the logical place to try the technique because of the known reserves 
sitting just off UCSB in the South Ellwood Field. In the North Sea, such wells 
have been used to extract oil from more than four miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought at the time that this would be acclaimed, not only as an economic 
masterstroke but also as an environmental masterstroke," lamented Warren, who 
retired earlier this year. "I'm still bewildered by the vehemence and the 
nature of the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 The about 105 million barrels of oil sought by Mobil lie in two deposits, one 
3,000 feet and the other 10,000 feet below the ocean floor -- next to the Holly 
field but out of reach of conventional drilling technology. 
</P>
<P>
 It is just east of Holly that oil and gas seep from vents in the sea floor, 
casting a smelly, oily sheen on the ocean and coagulating into tar that sticks 
to swimmers and washes up on county beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil, which estimates that up to 4,000 gallons of gas and oil seep into the 
ocean there daily, captures some of the escaping petroleum with giant 
underwater tents. Company geologists say the seepage is natural, but critics 
contend that it is exacerbated by oil production. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco, which once owned rights to the field, sought to build three platforms 
and tap the oil but was turned down in 1987 by the county and the State Lands 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 When Warren took his idea of onshore drilling to Mobil, the company liked it 
so much it bought out Arco's interests and began developing the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mobil has not finalized its plan, it proposes to drill from shore at 
the old Ellwood Marine Terminal, where it now stores and ships the oil produced 
by Holly. 
</P>
<P>
 The company would build a 175-foot-tall drilling tower -- making it one of the 
tallest structures between Los Angeles and San Jose. The landmark would 
probably remain standing throughout the 25-year life of the project, Clarke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil produced by the wells would be sent by pipeline to Torrance, although 
Mobil must build a 26-mile pipeline to Carpinteria to connect with an existing 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural gas -- containing a high level of deadly hydrogen sulfide -- would be 
piped two miles west to the Ellwood Onshore Facility, an existing Mobil plant 
that would be upgraded to process the increased volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil officials tout a variety of environmental benefits. In addition to 
removing Platform Holly and transporting oil by pipeline, they say pumping out 
the oil would reduce the natural seepage. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists and homeowners -- including many UCSB faculty members -- 
say Mobil has picked a poor site to drill because it is near schools, a 
residential neighborhood, a popular beach and Devereux Slough, part of a noted 
nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Labeling the project "Drillview" because of the tower, these opponents say 
that it will produce visual blight and that its 24-hour-a-day operation will 
mean increased traffic, noise and light. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more serious, they say, is the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the 
natural gas pumped up by the wells. Although Mobil insists it can handle the 
gas safely, critics fear a leak could pose a serious threat to nearby homes and 
the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Clearview would do is shift the hazards onto land and extend them for a 
longer period," said Bruce Bimber, a political science professor at UCSB who is 
leading homeowner opposition to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, who argue for an end to use of fossil fuels, say there is 
only enough oil in the field to supply the nation for seven days -- not enough 
to warrant building facilities that would last more than a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes also contend that Mobil's offer to remove Platform Holly is hollow 
because it is running out of oil and will soon come down anyway -- a contention 
disputed by the oil company. As long as prices remain high, Mobil says, there 
is enough oil to keep Holly in production until its lease expires in 2016. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil officials also say they can run a safe operation and mitigate most 
environmental effects, such as noise, lighting and traffic. In many places, 
including the Los Angeles area, oil operations coexist peacefully with 
residential and commercial neighbors, they note. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents' best chance to block the project appears to lie with the 
university, which recently became Mobil's landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to build new faculty and student housing, UCSB recently acquired a 
174-acre parcel that includes the proposed drilling site. Under its lease, 
Mobil can continue using the property to store and ship oil until 2016, but 
cannot drill without UCSB's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials say they have not reached a decision, but acknowledge 
that Mobil's proposal may not mesh with their plan to build homes that would 
draw star professors from throughout the country. Indeed, some current faculty 
members threaten to bolt UCSB if the drilling project is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the face of it, it would appear incompatible," said Bob Kuntz, assistant 
UCSB chancellor for budget and planning. "However, Mobil believes they can make 
it compatible." 
</P>
<P>
 At the popular Devereux beach just below the proposed drilling site, UCSB 
students and surfers were hostile to Mobil's plan -- even if it would mean 
removing Platform Holly from view. "It's all about money," said psychology 
student Jack Seidler. "They (Mobil) don't care about the environment. They're 
looking out for themselves and sugarcoating it with an environmental plea." 
Drilling Plan 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil Oil Corp. proposes to use new directional drilling technology to bore 
under the ocean from shore and recover offshore oil reserves now off limits to 
drilling. Calling its proposal "Clearview," the company would remove the aging 
offshore Platform Holly and end the barging of oil. But environmentalists 
oppose the plan because it would mean construction of an industrial facility 
including a 17-story drill tower onshore near UC Santa Barbara, the Isla Vista 
community, faculty homes and a nature preserve including Devereux Slough. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellwood Onshore Facility: Now used to process oil and gas produced by Platform 
Holly. It would be upgraded to handle increased production. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellwood Marine Terminal: Now used to store oil and load it on barges to Los 
Angeles. It is the proposed drilling site, where gas and oil would be 
seperated. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW IT WOULD WORK 
</P>
<P>
 1) Mobil would use new "extended reach" drilling techniques, angling a well 
almost 90 degrees and boring horizontally under the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Ellwood Marine Terminal onshore, Mobil would drill 500 to 1,000 feet 
straight down, then gradually turn every 100 feet until the turn is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 2) The petroleum would be pumped to the marine terminal, where the oil and gas 
would be separated. Oil would be pumped through a proposed pipeline to 
Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
 3) The gas, which contains deadly hydrogen sulfide, would travel by underwater 
pipeline to Mobil's existing onshore processing plant, next to the Sandpiper 
Golf Course.

S. AFRICA BLACKS RECLAIM THEIR ANCESTRAL LANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a bitter winter morning in 1974 when heavily armed white police 
suddenly stormed into this quiet rural community with dogs, trucks and 
bulldozers to forcibly move thousands of terrified blacks to distant dumping 
grounds in so-called black homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was asleep," recalled Aaron Thamaga, who was then 12. "But then there was a 
light in the house. The roof of my father's house was grass. . . . And they 
were burning the roof. Then they knocked all the walls down." 
</P>
<P>
 The brutal attempt to erase what was called a "black spot" from a white area 
drew little notice two decades ago. Doornkop was only one of hundreds of 
nonwhite communities cruelly demolished under apartheid's "forced removals" 
policy. Its residents were among about 3.5 million people uprooted at gunpoint 
by the white minority regime. 
</P>
<P>
 But justice is finally coming. The dispossessed now can begin to reclaim and 
resettle their property under South Africa's new land restoration law, the most 
significant legislation to redress the wrongs of apartheid since the country's 
historic all-race election in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The denizens of Doornkop went home filled with bitter memories and ambitious 
dreams last week, the first community to move back since the far-reaching law 
was enacted two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ancestors are buried here," Thamaga said emotionally, pointing to a 
dilapidated, weed-choked cemetery filled with broken headstones and rusting tin 
crosses. "I think they are happy today to see my face. I'm so happy. This is my 
land." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of 45 families -- about 200 people in all -- were trucked back to 
reclaim the 2,000 acres in the rolling green hills of the Eastern Transvaal 
that were settled by their forebears nearly a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyous singing, ululations and solemn prayers of homecoming soon echoed across 
the desolate fields, empty but for broken bricks and a cluster of 
bullet-riddled walls under nearby trees. That's all that remains of a poor but 
vibrant farming community that once boasted livestock, orchards, shops and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very peaceful place," 54-year-old Deborah Kgoroba recalled. "We were 
almost all churchgoers. We were almost all family too, because so many people 
married. And we plowed our gardens and vegetables. There was no hunger at all. 
And they moved us to places all covered with stones, and trees with thorns, and 
snakes all around." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her parents were trucked to an impoverished township in Lebowa, about 
50 miles away, while all their belongings disappeared somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost everything," she said. "I went to where the police said to complain, 
but to this day, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The eviction was typical. Although 283 Bapedi-speaking farmers jointly held a 
deed to the land, the government officially declared Doornkop a "black spot" in 
1964 and ordered it removed. Not surprisingly, the residents refused to move. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the next decade, the area saw an influx of thousands of black migrants, 
most made homeless by other forced removals and evictions from white farms. It 
also saw repeated attacks and arrests of community leaders and harassment of 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police finally cleared the site in June, 1974, after four days of 
house-to-house searches. Accompanied by snarling police dogs, they shot locks 
off doors, beat and arrested those who resisted and forced the rest onto trucks 
as bulldozers leveled the village while a police helicopter clattered overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was horrible," said Helen Makatelele, 38. "They are shouting at us. They 
don't give us a chance to pack. All our cutlery is broken. And we cannot take 
our sheep, our cows and our chickens. I was crying so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were taken to three rural townships built on arid parcels of land, 
but many later migrated to Soweto and other slums around Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 No one today publicly justifies those policies. How to right the wrong, 
however, is another question. The restoration of land to the dispossessed is 
one of the thorniest problems facing South African President Nelson Mandela's 
new government. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cases date to 1913, for example, when the Natives Land Act banned blacks 
from owning land outside tiny reserves, later called homelands, in the 
country's poorest and least arable areas. That was more than three decades 
before apartheid was created. 
</P>
<P>
 Later laws, particularly the Group Areas Act of 1950, added harsh new 
restrictions by decreeing where members of each race could live, work or go to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the land seized under the segregationist laws was sold at rock-bottom 
prices to white farmers, who then often hired black laborers in a feudal-style 
system of farm tenancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The land and group areas acts were repealed in 1991. But their pernicious 
effects are entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites, who make up 13% of the population, own an estimated 80% of the land. 
Nearly half the black population still ekes out an existence in the 
overcrowded, overgrazed and underdeveloped homelands where so many were sent. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, people can file claims to property they say was taken 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 A commission will be created to verify claims and mediate disputes. Claims 
that cannot be settled will go before a Land Claims Court, which can rule to 
restore ownership, award compensation or reject the claim. The court will sit 
for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela has pledged to redistribute 30% of the agricultural land to blacks 
within five years, largely by giving away government-owned property and by 
buying acreage back from whites. He has taken special pains to reassure nervous 
white farmers that their land will not be expropriated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can be done without depriving people of their property or farms," 
Mandela insisted when he signed the land restoration law. "There is no need for 
the widespread concern in the farming community." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 95 claims involving up to 1 million people from displaced 
communities have been submitted to the Department of Land Affairs, said Nico 
van Rensburg, director of land allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is already negotiating to buy land from white farmers in several 
contested areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only talking about buying at fair market value," he said. "And the 
farmers are under no obligation to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the resettlement of Doornkop took 18 months of contentious 
negotiations -- and that was government-owned land. The South African police 
had turned the then-empty land into a firing range in 1988 and later added a 
small conference center. 
</P>
<P>
 Spent shells and grenade casings still litter the earth by the 
shrapnel-shattered walls of four former school and church buildings that police 
used for target practice. A sign warns in three languages that the ground 
"contains unexploded bombs, shells and cartridges." 
</P>
<P>
 But its former -- and future -- residents ignored the dire warnings as they 
drove up one morning last week in six trucks and a convoy of cars and taxis. 
Margaret Matlala, 54, waved a huge new South African flag from one van and kept 
waving it as she paraded around the dusty field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought it special for today," she said. "Now I feel like crying. And I feel 
like singing." 
</P>
<P>
 The men quickly unloaded their belongings from the trucks, dumping heaps of 
rusty tin roofing, torn sofas, broken bedsteads, grimy mattresses and even a 
porcelain sink onto the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon, the first tent had been erected. A water tanker truck and 
portable toilets, sent by the Department of Land Affairs, soon arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalushi Kalushi, a spokesman for the residents, said they had decided not to 
wait until proper homes could be built and sanitation provided, as the 
government had offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will improvise somehow," he said. "We will survive. . . . The rest will 
take care of itself. That's the general attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to plan, the land department will help a community 
foundation provide town planning, schooling, electricity and other development 
needs. The project will be eligible for special funding under the government's 
reconstruction and development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's in the future. Most Doornkop residents were far too happy about 
finally coming home -- if only to red dirt and rubble -- to worry about such 
mundane matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dreaming," declared a toothless Josephina Ngcobo, 78, grinning as she 
spoke. "Really, I'm dreaming today." 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed a bony finger at the cemetery where her parents, her brothers and 
three children are buried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say I will never die until I go back to Doornkop," she said. "Now I 
can die in peace."

CLINTON AIDES, GOP CLASH OVER BOSNIA; BALKANS: GINGRICH AND DOLE CALL FOR 
PULLOUT OF PEACEKEEPERS AND BOMBING OF REBEL SERBS. PERRY AND CHRISTOPHER ARGUE 
MOVES WOULD WIDEN CONFLICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration clashed sharply with top GOP lawmakers Sunday over 
U.S. policy in Bosnia, with the Republicans calling for the withdrawal of U.N. 
peacekeepers and the bombing of the Serbian nationalists, and key Cabinet 
members countering that such moves would mean a wider war. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day of cross-fire on the Sunday television talk shows, incoming Senate 
Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said 
that the Administration's push for a diplomatic solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is unworkable and urged a more aggressive stance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry insisted that pulling peacekeeping troops out and lifting the arms 
embargo against the Bosnian Muslims, as the Republicans proposed, would only 
lead to increased killing in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, it's a war strategy," Christopher said on the ABC program "This 
Week With David Brinkley" in an interview from Hungary, where he is attending a 
conference on European security. The others spoke on NBC's "Meet the Press" and 
the CBS program "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry also said that evacuating the more than 22,000 U.N. peacekeepers now in 
Bosnia would require at least 10,000 allied ground troops and would be a risky 
and "very difficult" operation. He said U.S. troops "would participate" in any 
evacuation but insisted that the size of any U.S. force is still to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that if the U.N. forces leave, their departure would "give up 
the advantage" that the peacekeeping troops have provided -- that is, reducing 
the intensity of the conflict and in the process saving the lives of thousands 
of civilians who otherwise might have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration and the GOP leadership have been at odds over the Bosnia 
question for several months, but their war of words has intensified since the 
situation there began deteriorating a few weeks ago and since Republicans won 
control of the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans' call for lifting the arms embargo and increasing the allied 
bombing of the Bosnian Serbs has drawn far more attention recently since it 
became clear that they could have the power in January to force the 
Administration to follow some of their prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole just returned from a series of consultations in Europe that included 
briefings at the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 
Brussels and talks in London with leaders of the British government. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole charged Sunday that the U.N. peacemaking effort in Bosnia has been 
ineffective and that the British, Canadian, French, Dutch and other 
peacekeeping troops there have "become hostages for the Serbs." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich echoed Dole's assertions that the U.N. troops should be withdrawn, 
calling the United Nations incompetent in dealing with any serious dispute. 
"It's fine as long as it's there . . . doing good things," he said. "When you 
get to a serious problem . . . (it) is literally incompetent, and it kills 
people by its behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Dole and Gingrich urged lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian 
Muslims and then bombing Serbian emplacements all around Bosnia, not just near 
the six designated U.N. "safe areas." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is in full retreat now," Dole said, ". . . trying to accommodate 
the Serbs. And I assume if you accommodate the Serbs enough, they'll say, 
'Well, we have peace,' but peace at what price?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher contended that Dole's proposals for ending the conflict are 
"essentially . . . a war strategy" that ultimately would force the 
Administration to send in ground troops and "would mean war for the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said the Administration's current hope is to "reinvigorate" the 
peace process by prodding the nationalist Serbs to accept a negotiated peace 
settlement. "Our main aim in this, at the present time, is to prevent the 
spread of the war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry warned that if the allies were to lift the arms embargo against the 
Bosnian Muslims, that would prompt Britain, Canada and other allies to withdraw 
their U.N. peacekeepers, forcing the United States to help evacuate them. 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied that the United States has abandoned hopes of using NATO air 
power once again to help pressure the Bosnian Serbs into agreeing to a brokered 
settlement. "We will continue to propose that when appropriate," he said.

SUPERVISORS CALL EMERGENCY SESSION ON FUND FOR TODAY; FINANCE: O.C. OFFICIALS 
SPEND SUNDAY IN SERIES OF BRIEFING MEETINGS. DISMAY BUILDS OVER SELECTIVE 
NO-LOSS GUARANTEE. 
</P>

 Scrambling for a strategy after last week's announcement that Orange County's 
investment portfolio has lost $1.5 billion this year, officials spent Sunday in 
a series of briefing sessions, and the Board of Supervisors called an emergency 
meeting for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republican activists began calling for the ouster of County Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron, manager of the investment fund and the county's 
only elected Democrat. And some investors in the county fund expressed dismay 
on learning that Citron had given a special no-loss guarantee to three school 
districts and the Orange County Board of Education, which borrowed a total of 
$200 million for the sole purpose of reaping profits through the investment 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was wrong in my mind," said Andrew Czorny, treasurer for the Orange County 
Water District, which has $87 million in the fund. Citron "was putting 
potential returns of other participants in the county at risk. . . . We 
experienced losses because of this side deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis involving the county's investment pool erupted Thursday with the 
disclosure that risky financial maneuvers directed by Citron had cost the 
equivalent of 20% of the actual amount, excluding leverage, put into the pool 
by 185 cities, school districts and other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, acknowledging that some of his fellow 
Republicans are calling for Citron to step down, said he would not pass 
judgment "until I get a further briefing on how bad this situation is." But if 
Citron's resignation "would facilitate a speedy resolution of this problem," 
Stanton said, "I am not going to stand in his way." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Citron, however, describe him as a fighter who is not likely to 
walk away, especially if he sees the likelihood of financial recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert C. Politiski, Citron's friend of 48 years, said he would be "very, 
very, very surprised" if Citron "even had any thought" of resigning. "He does 
not turn or run from anything," Politiski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe, designated as the county's spokesman on the 
investment fund crisis, could not be reached for comment Sunday. County Counsel 
Terry C. Andrus and County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider worked in 
their offices Sunday but did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is going nuts right now," said Tustin City Councilman Jeffery M. 
Thomas, a longtime foe of Citron. The situation, he said, "is like a bunch of 
cockroaches going for cover now that the lights have been turned on." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, meanwhile, remained in his Santa Ana home and would not speak with 
reporters. Neighbors who have seen him over the weekend said he is handling the 
crisis well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just says he's focusing on straightening things out, and that he's 
confident they will straighten out," said Dan Miller, who lives next door in a 
neighborhood of elegant homes, expansive lawns and circular driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the treasurer had attended the rare Sunday sessions at the Hall 
of Administration in Santa Ana, Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley 
emphatically said, "No." 
</P>
<P>
 While county officials worked on damage control, longtime Citron critics said 
they are considering a recall campaign. Eight local Republicans meeting Friday 
about the financial crisis determined that they would need about 75,000 
signatures to mount such a campaign. It would cost about $180,000, said Thomas, 
who backed Citron's opponent, accountant John M.W. Moorlach, in the June 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was also a topic of discussion at political gatherings Saturday, 
including a holiday party hosted by state Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach) and a fund-raiser for presidential hopeful U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm 
(R-Texas), several GOP activists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) "has been approached by several people to 
possibly head up, or be involved in, a recall campaign," said James Bieber, 
Conroy's legislative aide. "He's still mulling it over." 
</P>
<P>
 But County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said that the response to the 
investment fund loss should not be a political issue. "I think we ought to stop 
this partisan bickering," she said. "Scapegoating is no answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of several city councils -- including Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach and 
Irvine -- said they have scheduled special agenda items or closed sessions this 
week to discuss their investment situation. 
</P>
<P>
 A notice was posted Sunday at the Hall of Administration announcing today's 
special Board of Supervisors meeting at 2:30 p.m. "related to the county's 
investment bond pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said the supervisors have also added a closed session to their regular 
Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Among actions to be discussed at today's meeting, supervisors said, is whether 
to form an oversight committee of the pool's four largest investors, who would 
be consulted before any major investment decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest investors, the Irvine Ranch Water District, has said it 
will withdraw its remaining $300 million from the fund later this month unless 
a committee of the top investors is given full disclosure of the portfolio's 
activity and the opportunity to approve strategies for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 No investor can take any money back now, beyond normal withdrawals, without 
waiting 30 days and suffering a 20% loss, the amount that the portfolio's 
market value has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 The two major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Services and Standard 
& Poor's Rating Group, have been reviewing the county's financial condition, 
and Standard & Poor's Friday signaled that it may lower the rating for Orange 
County bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 If the now-stellar rating is downgraded, the county would have more difficulty 
borrowing and would have to pay higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Another proposal is for an oversight group comprising the 11 top investors, 
who have a total of $2.5 billion in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get in a tough situation, you go into this denial thing first where 
you close your eyes and hope it goes away," Irvine Ranch Water District's 
chairman, Peer Swan, said Sunday. "But when you get into a tough situation, 
what you want to do is get smart people together immediately to help you. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county invested our money, then went upside-down with it. I want 
agreement as a non-county player that, before they do anything, I will be able 
to review the situation and have outside analysis." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of limiting such a committee's membership to only large investors did 
not sit well with some municipal officials, though. Newport Beach City Manager 
Kevin J. Murphy said he is concerned that the panel might not represent smaller 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have anybody fending for us," said Murphy, whose city has $18 
million in the pool. "We're small potatoes . . . but we need our money just as 
badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Other investors expressed concern about the special deal that Citron struck 
with the four school groups in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 All 31 of the county's school districts have money invested in the pool, 
including about $350 million in borrowed funds used to cover operating expenses 
while the districts await tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 But four agencies -- Newport-Mesa Unified School District, Irvine Unified 
School District, North Orange County Community College District and the Orange 
County Department of Education -- borrowed an extra $200 million and invested 
it through Citron, armed with oral and written guarantees that the overall pool 
would back their investment so that none of it would be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The districts agreed to the unconventional arrangement in an attempt to raise 
badly needed cash as state funding for education dwindled. Their investment 
earned them about $1 million each in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other investors wondered Sunday why they were not offered the same terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rather upsetting," said Don Watson, treasurer of Huntington Beach, which 
has $43.5 million in the county fund. "If you are in a pool, you should all be 
under the same circumstances.' 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Mayor John Collins, who also sits on the board of the Orange 
County Sanitation District, said he is "very, very upset" to learn of the 
arrangement. "I don't see how Citron could do that, quite frankly," Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas R. Mueller, a securities attorney who specializes in public finance, 
said the idea of backing some investors' risk with other investors' money 
"raises some questions." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I can tell you on a Sunday afternoon that it's illegal, but it 
raises questions as to whether the treasurer acted within his authority in 
granting preferential treatment," said Mueller, who lives in Fullerton and 
works in the Los Angeles office of law firm Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue. "I 
just find it somewhat astonishing that he finds that authority and thinks it's 
prudent to make that guarantee." 
</P>
<P>
 Most investors have said they will wait for more information before deciding 
whether to move their investments out of the county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad, sad day for Orange County, and we don't need to make it worse," 
said Costa Mesa City Councilman Joe Erickson, whose city earlier this year 
reduced its holdings in the county pool from $14 million to $2.6 million now. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Irvine Mayor Michael Ward, echoing the sentiments of many investors: "The 
big decision is, 'Are we going to pull our money out?' That hasn't been decided 
yet. We don't want to be the ones to start the run on the bank."

SANTA ANA LAW ON CAMPING TO BE ARGUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States attorney general, a trio of retired state Supreme Court 
justices and some of the country's most prestigious constitutional law 
professors are throwing their weight behind the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than 90 city attorneys from throughout California, plus several 
conservative legal foundations, are standing firmly behind the city of Santa 
Ana in a showdown that comes Thursday. The state Supreme Court will then begin 
its review of a city ordinance that would prohibit camping or the storing of 
belongings on public property. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which critics say effectively expels the homeless from Santa Ana, was 
enacted in 1992 but overturned by a state appellate court that sharply derided 
it as an unconstitutional "punishment for poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the attention of cities throughout California and the nation is riveted 
on the Santa Ana case, which legal experts say could help resolve the issue of 
anti-homeless ordinances once and for all, possibly in front of the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that whether or not the regulations on the books in many 
cities will be allowed is going to depend on this case, and if this is allowed, 
there's no doubt that many cities are going to adopt similar ones," said Erwin 
Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at the USC School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly frustrated by growing homeless populations and the crime, public 
health hazards and eyesores that can accompany life on the street, more and 
more cities are passing laws to push the homeless off public property. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Miami, Dallas, Baltimore, San Francisco and Seattle have all 
passed ordinances directed at the homeless that have landed in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's case marks the first time the United States has filed a brief on 
behalf of the homeless, homeless advocates said. But the government filed the 
brief only last week, and it remains unclear whether the application will be 
accepted or denied, a clerk of the court said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the law say the appellate court decision on Santa Ana's 
ordinance ties cities' hands in their efforts to govern and wrongly creates a 
constitutional right to live on public property. 
</P>
<P>
 "If homeless people are given a constitutional right to camp, what does it do 
to the quality of life in our cities? What does it do to our liability?" asked 
Santa Ana Assistant City Atty. Robert Wheeler, who will argue the city's case 
in front of the state's highest court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. E. Thomas Dunn Jr., who will also ask the 
court Thursday to overturn the appellate ruling, said the city "ought to have a 
right to keep (public areas) clean for the rest of us. There's no reason why 
there ought to be a Republic of the Homeless, like an abdication of a piece of 
territory to those who are above the law." 
</P>
<P>
 But those arguing on behalf of the homeless say there are many ways cities can 
keep public areas clean, including passing less restrictive laws banning 
camping in parks or forbidding people to erect shelters or tents, both 
unchallenged laws already on Santa Ana's books. 
</P>
<P>
 "By making it a crime to use sleeping bags and blankets in every public area 
of the city at a time when the city has a substantial population of people who 
have no place to house themselves, Santa Ana is essentially making it a crime 
to be homeless in the city," said Harry Simon, an attorney with the Legal Aid 
Society of Orange County who will argue the case for the homeless with two 
other attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not claiming that the homeless are some sort of protected class. What 
we're saying is that this is a pretty transparent attempt to drive the homeless 
from the city," Simon said. "They can't drive anyone from the city. They 
couldn't decide they wanted to drive blue-eyed people from the city." 
</P>
<P>
 If the court upholds the law, homeless advocates warn, cities will scramble to 
enact similar ordinances for fear of becoming the enclave into which other 
cities force their poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange and Fullerton enacted similar laws following Santa Ana's but have not 
enforced them under threat of litigation, and at least four other Orange County 
cities were poised to do so when the state court put Santa Ana's ordinance on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California alone, five other cities passed anti-homeless 
ordinances in the same 18-month period, said Maria Foscarinis, executive 
director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington. 
Those cities are West Hollywood, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Santa Ana is pushing out its homeless population, those people will have 
to go somewhere, and the fear is they'll go into the neighboring cities," 
Foscarinis said. "Nationally, as municipality after municipality adopts this 
kind of ordinance, our fear is that homeless people will be banished and not 
permitted to remain anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the homeless contend that Santa Ana's law violates the state and 
federal constitutions by punishing people because of their "status" of 
homelessness and restricting their right to travel. It also is 
unconstitutionally vague and overly broad, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the ordinance say it legally punishes the conduct of living in 
public places, not the status of being homeless, and that many people choose to 
sleep outside. Anyone who can prove they did everything they could to find 
other options would not be prosecuted, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana ordinance prohibits camping, use of camping equipment, including 
sleeping bags or blankets, or storage of any personal belongings on any public 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the city adopted the sweeping ordinance in 1992, hundreds of 
people had set up camp in the Civic Center area, erecting tents and shelters. 
Some relieved themselves, had sex, and used and sold drugs in view of 
government employees, said Wheeler, whose City Hall office borders the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how many times I had to step around pools of feces and pools 
of urine," he said. "There were rats out there." 
</P>
<P>
 By the city's estimate, there are 3,000 homeless people in Santa Ana, which 
has only 330 shelter beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Enactment of the law followed years of increasingly hostile actions against 
the homeless by the city staff. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 city memo details instructions to a city "Vagrancy Task Force" to 
confiscate property and sleeping bags stored by homeless people. And in August, 
1990, Santa Ana police arrested 64 homeless people in the Civic Center area, 
took them to a nearby stadium where they were marked with numbers, then chained 
them to bleachers. Those who were homeless were cited for offenses ranging from 
littering to jaywalking. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials argue that none of the actions taken by city workers were part 
of a formal city policy. The anti-camping ordinance does not discriminate 
against the homeless, Wheeler said, and applies equally to Boy Scouts and 
business people. 
</P>
<P>
 But challengers say the chain of events leading to the law, and the way it was 
enforced, indicate that city officials created it specifically to force 
homeless people from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be applied to judges and lawyers and businessmen, but the fact of 
the matter is people aren't sleeping in the Santa Ana Civic Center because they 
think it's a neat place to camp," Simon said. "This law is pretty obviously 
aimed at the homeless, particularly in light of the city's long history of 
attempts to rid itself of homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal cases of about a dozen homeless people cited under the law were 
stayed when the Orange County public defender's office challenged the 
constitutionality of the ordinance. That case has been consolidated with the 
civil matter and will also be argued in front of the state Supreme Court by 
Dunn and Deputy Public Defender Kevin Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 If the law is upheld, the Orange County district attorney's office will be 
free to proceed with the prosecution of those cases plus at least a dozen 
others involving homeless people arrested under the ordinance in early 1993, 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety California city attorneys endorsing Santa Ana's position joined in a 
friend-of-the-court brief drafted by San Francisco Deputy City Atty. Michael E. 
Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Several conservative legal groups are also siding with Santa Ana, including 
the Sacramento-based Pacific Legal Foundation and Criminal Justice Legal 
Foundation, and the Washington-based American Alliance for Rights and 
Responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you accept the basic premise from the Court of Appeal, then where do you 
draw the line? On a bad weather night, I suppose you'd have to make the 
argument that you have to open your public buildings to the homeless," said 
Anthony Caso of the Pacific Legal Foundation, which predominantly defends the 
rights of property owners. "Simply because an individual has a need, that's not 
converted into a right to be fulfilled at public expense." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high enough that the U.S. government argued in a 24-page brief 
filed with the court last week that the Santa Ana ordinance violates the Eighth 
Amendment by "criminalizing homeless persons' sleeping in public even when no 
shelter is available." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has "a clear responsibility . . . to engender respect 
for the human dignity of the homeless," said the brief, filed by Deval L. 
Patrick, assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Also filing briefs on behalf of the homeless were Foscarinis' organization, a 
group of 40 of the nation's top constitutional law experts, three retired state 
justices, the American Civil Liberties Union and a dozen youth and religious 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a responsibility that a government has -- a country, a state, a city 
-- to take care of its own and not to say, 'The way we're going to solve this 
is to force these people to leave our jurisdiction,' " said retired state 
Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso, now a law professor at UCLA who joined in 
one of the briefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Supreme Court of California rules that they can't do this, then it's 
going to force the cities to put pressure on Washington, to start trying to 
resolve the issues of the homeless in a more global way. . . . The issues are 
very important social, economic and political issues, and as happens so often 
it has landed in the lap of a court, and the court will have to struggle with 
it."

LIBEL SUIT FIGURE TO TEACH NEWS CLASS; JOURNALISM: SOME UC BERKELEY STUDENTS 
QUESTION HIRING OF JEFFREY MASSON FOR ETHICS SESSIONS. HE LOST CASE AGAINST NEW 
YORKER WRITER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARAH KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 10 years, Freud scholar Jeffrey Masson waged a futile legal battle to 
persuade jurors that magazine writer Janet Malcolm violated journalistic ethics 
in a controversial profile she wrote about him. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal court jury disagreed and exonerated Malcolm last month. But next 
spring, Masson will get another chance to argue journalism ethics -- from the 
front of a classroom at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 In an appointment that has stirred protests among journalism school students, 
Masson has been asked by Tom Goldstein, dean of the graduate school of 
journalism, to conduct a five-week portion of Goldstein's 15-week course on 
"Ethical Issues in Journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy -- which pits notions of academic freedom against questions of 
professional qualifications -- comes on the 30th anniversary of the Free Speech 
Movement's inception, which has drawn visitors from all over the country to the 
school to commemorate the protest that earned students the right to debate 
political controversies on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalism students are challenging Masson's standing as a journalist and his 
qualifications as an ethics instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't worked in daily journalism," said second-year student Ann Lopez. 
"Since he hasn't been out there facing the deadline pressure -- making quick 
ethical decisions when reporting -- I don't think he should play a major role 
in this class." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Madison, a second-year student, said she is trying to organize a 
boycott of the elective course to protest the appointment. "If (Masson) felt he 
was libeled, he did the right thing to sue," Madison said. "It doesn't mean he 
has to teach here." 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldstein has defended the hiring of Masson in meetings with students and 
letters to the faculty. Masson will conduct the portions of the class that deal 
with issues of privacy in profiles and biographies. He will be paid $1,500 for 
eight lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't worked in a newsroom, but as the author of half a dozen nonfiction 
books in the last decade, he is certainly a journalist in the broadest and best 
sense," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein said Masson, as a scholar and biographer -- as well as the focus of 
intense media scrutiny -- has considered the same issues confronting the class. 
</P>
<P>
 Masson has a Ph.D. in Sanskrit from Harvard University and taught a course 
called "Media Harms" at the University of Michigan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is best known for his protracted legal battle with New Yorker writer 
Janet Malcolm over whether she libeled him by using quotes out of context and 
fabricating incidents in a profile she wrote after he was dismissed from a 
prestigious job as curator of the Freud Archives in London because of his 
renegade views about Sigmund Freud. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm argued that she never intentionally misquoted Masson, and a jury found 
acceptable her practice of stringing together quotations from different times 
and places without indicating their context. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein is a friend of Masson, and at the time of the verdict called 
Malcolm's compression of quotations into a single monologue "regrettable" 
because it goes "against what I consider to be good journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldstein said last week that he disagrees with Masson "on some 
fundamentals. I do not think he should have brought his case and have told him 
that for five years. But in his lawsuit . . . he is not the one who admitted to 
compressing quotations, which I think violates fundamental norms of 
journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Masson has yet to arrive on campus, but said in a telephone interview that he 
is baffled by the strong reaction his appointment has generated. "I don't 
understand the controversy," he said. "Do they think I will poison the 
atmosphere or twist their minds?" 
</P>
<P>
 The syllabus for Masson's section of the course asks students to compare and 
contrast the biographies of several public figures -- including Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt, Edward Kennedy, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton -- to determine how 
writers treat the intimate details of a subject's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Masson said he hopes the class will define what constitutes a fair and 
accurate portrayal of a person -- the issue at the heart of his legal battle 
with Malcolm. Her 48,500-word magazine article used details of Masson's sexual 
exploits to portray him as an egomaniac obsessed with sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Masson said he plans to address in the course what he sees as a trend in news 
to illuminate the sensational details of someone's life without making a larger 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will look at what does it take to know someone, how deep do you have to 
go, what does it mean to be fair," Masson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although faculty members agree that Masson's presence will spark discussion, 
some professors worry that the appointment may suggest that the school has 
taken a side in the Masson-Malcolm case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It raises the appearance of impropriety -- as if we were in some way giving a 
stamp of approval to his quarrel with Janet Malcolm and the New Yorker," 
cultural reporting professor David Littlejohn told the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Rasky, acting associate professor and former New York Times reporter, 
said she is also concerned about the school's reputation and worried that the 
choice of Masson "may open the school up to ridicule." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Rasky said, "in the end . . . it comes down to academic freedom. I am not 
prepared to go to the wall and jeopardize that." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of -- or perhaps because of -- the disagreement over Masson's 
involvement in the course, many other students said they welcome his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what goes on in ethics classes normally is just empty rhetoric," 
said Charlie Le Duff, a second-year student. "People say, 'I wouldn't write 
about O.J.' But sure they would. They need to face the reality of the downside 
of it all and Masson embodies that. I don't think we should be afraid of what 
he has to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Another student said the journalism school should invite more people who 
challenge media practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to hear from people who feel they've been wronged by 
the press," said Lisa Weaver. "Once you get into the job market, there will be 
pressure to beat the competition. This is the place to hear different views."

EMERGENCY MEETING ON FUND TODAY; FINANCE: ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISORS PLAN 
SPECIAL SESSION ABOUT IMPERILED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Scrambling for a recovery strategy after learning that Orange County's 
investment portfolio has lost $1.5 billion in value this year, officials spent 
Sunday in a series of special briefing sessions, and the county Board of 
Supervisors called an emergency meeting for today. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis was triggered by Thursday's disclosure that risky financial 
maneuvers had cost the investment fund the equivalent of 20% of the money put 
in by various government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Today will be critical as the financial markets, closed for the weekend, 
re-evaluate the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 While city and county officials held strategy sessions Sunday, some Republican 
activists began calling for the ouster of Treasurer Robert L. Citron, the only 
elected Democrat in the county government. 
</P>
<P>
 And some investors in the fund expressed dismay on learning that a special 
guarantee was given to three school districts and the Orange County Board of 
Education, which borrowed a total of $200 million for the sole purpose of 
reaping profits through Citron's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The special arrangement "was wrong in my mind," said Andrew Czorny, treasurer 
for the Orange County Water District, which has $87 million in the pool. Citron 
"was putting potential returns of other participants in the county at risk. . . 
. We experienced losses because of this side deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, acknowledging that some of his fellow Republicans 
are calling for Citron to step down, said he would not pass judgment "until I 
get a further briefing on how bad this situation is." But if Citron's 
resignation "would facilitate a speedy resolution of this problem, I am not 
going to stand in his way." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Citron, however, describe him as a fighter who is not likely to 
walk away, especially if he sees a possibility for financial recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe, designated as the county's spokesman on the 
investment fund crisis, could not be reached for comment Sunday. County Counsel 
Terry C. Andrus and County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider did not 
return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, who managed the nearly $20-billion investment fund, would not speak 
with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is going nuts right now," said Tustin Councilman Jeff Thomas, a 
longtime foe of Citron. The situation, he said, "is like a bunch of cockroaches 
going for cover now that the lights have been turned on." 
</P>
<P>
 While county officials worked on damage control, longtime Citron critics said 
they are considering a recall campaign. The issue was a topic at political 
gatherings Saturday, including a Christmas party hosted by state Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) and a fund-raiser for presidential hopeful U.S. 
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), several GOP activists said. 
</P>
<P>
 But County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said the response to the investment 
fund loss should not be a political issue. "I think we ought to stop this 
partisan bickering," she said. "Scapegoating is no answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Among actions to be discussed at today's meeting, supervisors said, is whether 
to form an oversight committee of the pool's largest investors, who would be 
consulted before any major investment decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest investors, the Irvine Ranch Water District, has said it 
will withdraw its remaining $300 million from the fund this month unless a 
committee of the top four investors is given full disclosure of the portfolio's 
activity and the opportunity to approve strategies for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors expressed concern about the special deal that Citron apparently 
made with the four school groups in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 All 31 school districts in the county have money invested in the pool, 
including about $350 million in borrowed funds to cover operating expenses 
while the districts await tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 But four agencies -- the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, Irvine Unified 
School District, North Orange County Community College District and Orange 
County Department of Education -- borrowed an extra $200 million and invested 
it through Citron, armed with oral and written guarantees that the overall pool 
would back their investment so none of it would be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies agreed to the unconventional arrangement in an attempt to raise 
badly needed cash as state funding for education dwindled, and their investment 
earned them about $1 million each in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other investors wondered why they were not offered the same terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rather upsetting," said David Watson, treasurer of Huntington Beach, 
which has $43.5 million in the county fund. "If you are in a pool, you should 
all be under the same circumstances.' 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas R. Mueller, a securities attorney who specializes in public finance, 
said the idea of backing some investors' risk with other investors' money 
"raises some questions." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I can tell you on a Sunday afternoon that it's illegal, but it 
raises questions as to whether the treasurer acted within his authority in 
granting preferential treatment," said Mueller, with the Los Angeles office of 
law firm Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue. "I just find it somewhat astonishing 
that he finds that authority and thinks it's prudent to make that guarantee." 
</P>

NEW DAY IS DAWNING FOR STATE LEGISLATORS; CAPITOL: THE SHIFT IN POWER BROUGHT 
ABOUT BY THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS GETS PUT INTO PRACTICE THIS MORNING AS THE 
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OPEN SESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new, more conservative Legislature convenes today, bringing with it the 
likelihood that Willie Brown's 14-year reign as Assembly Speaker will end, 
along with his role as a dominant figure in state government. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans will control the selection of Speaker -- probably their Assembly 
leader, Jim Brulte -- for the first time in 25 years. Gov. Pete Wilson, buoyed 
by the new Republican majority in the Assembly and by gains in the Senate, 
already has conferred with GOP leaders about developing a legislative agenda, a 
sort of contract with California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans pledge to pass more anti-crime bills and are talking about 
steps to further reduce welfare grants, tackle new education reforms and pare 
back environmental laws and regulations they deem bad for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also intend to attack Democrat-protected laws mandating 
affirmative action in hiring and say they will attempt to change the tort 
system by limiting the ability of injured people to collect damages in civil 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 When they were in the minority, Republicans called for general tax cuts. 
However, now that they face the prospect of taking the lead role in putting 
together a state budget, there have been no such promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several new lawmakers are so-called moral conservatives, and some 
predict moves to restrict abortions by requiring minors to obtain parental 
consent, veteran Republicans insist the GOP agenda will not include such 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kinds of social issues," said Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia), 
"are frankly less important to the great bulk of Californians than providing 
for public safety and an environment in which jobs are created, and for getting 
government off the backs of the honest, hard-working middle class." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Democrats, with Brown's power waning, Senate President Pro Tem Bill 
Lockyer stands to emerge as the most influential party member in town. But the 
Democrats cling to a bare majority of 21 seats in the Senate, and Lockyer must 
contend with a Republican governor, a feisty new GOP majority in the Assembly 
and more conservatives in his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats hold out hope that Brown, a veteran of past speakership wars, 
can somehow retain his post. But with their new majority of 41 seats in the 
80-member lower house, Republicans are confident they can elect one of their 
own as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my expectation that (Brulte) will be the Speaker," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The speakership brings with it the power to hand out choice offices and prime 
parking spaces for the majority party, as well as shape legislative agendas and 
make appointments to committees. 
</P>
<P>
 On their arrival in the Capitol today, the lawmakers will be sworn in, elect 
new leaders, then attend mixers -- many are courtesy of lobbyists -- where they 
will meet new colleagues, as well as lobbyists. Unless the speakership fight is 
drawn out, they will be gone in a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 The new legislators will receive annual salaries of $72,000, thanks to a 37% 
pay increase granted them earlier this year by a commission created under a 
voter-approved ballot proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Assembly will have a far different look from the one just departed. In 
the Assembly, 28 of the 80 members are new, and 61 have been elected since 
1990. The turnover is due mainly to the 1990 voter-approved initiative limiting 
Assembly members to three terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Senators are limited to two four-year terms. Six of the seven new senators are 
moving up from the lower house. The 40-member Senate likely will be more 
conservative, with the loss of one Democratic seat, and the addition of former 
Assemblymen Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) and Ray Haynes (R-Temecula). 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer vowed that the Senate will get off to a fast start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be a little more expeditious, but I emphasize that the quality of work 
is more important than haste," Lockyer said, adding that his approach will be 
"to try to maintain the civility and nonpartisan nature of the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Committees will start taking up legislation when the session begins in 
January. One certainty is that the 1995 session will result in still more 
anti-crime bills, even though the 1994 Democrat-controlled Legislature approved 
104 measures lengthening prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said some anti-crime measures stalled in the Assembly, adding: "The 
increased numbers of Republicans will make it much easier to pass those." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's power in the Assembly was eroding even before the Nov. 8 election, 
largely because of turnover brought about by the term limit initiative. But 
unlike Brulte, he has fought for the speakership before and is not expected to 
go easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown won the job with Republican votes in 1980, emerging as the compromise 
candidate after a yearlong war between then-Speaker Leo McCarthy and 
then-Assemblyman Howard L. Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown survived in 1987 when five dissident Democrats split from him and sought 
to form a coalition with 36 Republicans. But then-Assemblyman Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale) helped Brown retain his post. 
</P>
<P>
 During his years as Speaker, Brown often used the trappings of his office to 
upstage even governors. He is renowned here for his wit, Brioni suits, 
Ferraris, taste for fine restaurants and his flashy fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 He attends the Academy Awards and travels to the Kentucky Derby, often at the 
expense of special interests. Clint Eastwood and Barbra Streisand were at his 
60th birthday party. All the while, he has carried on a law practice in San 
Francisco, guiding developers through the city's maze-like permit process. 
</P>
<P>
 "For good or ill, his political skills shaped not only the course of 
legislation, but the debate," said Johnson, a Republican rival who voted for 
Brown as Speaker in 1980. He called Brown "a consummate political actor (who) 
played the game as well as it has ever been played . . . and certainly raised 
political fund-raising to unimagined heights." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte, the likely new Speaker, is a 38-year-old career politician from the 
San Bernardino County suburb of Rancho Cucamonga whose main diversion seems to 
be going to movies. Brulte has worked overtime keeping Republicans in the fold, 
and assuaging potential Democratic supporters by assuring them he will be fair. 
Brulte insists he has the support of all 41 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 As the drama unfolds, one player to watch is Republican Assemblyman Paul 
Horcher of Diamond Bar. Entering his final Assembly term and having lost a run 
for the state Senate, Horcher's career appears stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 While Horcher has said he may vote for himself as Speaker, Republicans insist 
Horcher is in Brulte's tent. One reason for their confidence may be that 
Horcher is $280,000 in the red from his various campaigns. Horcher has been 
incommunicado for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Brulte gets 41 votes today, his majority will be tenuous. Mountjoy was 
reelected to the Assembly in November, but also won a special election for a 
Senate seat. Mountjoy plans to stick around the lower house long enough to vote 
for Brulte as Speaker, then walk to the Senate, where he will be sworn in. 
During the months it will take for Mountjoy's replacement to be elected, 
Brulte's majority would be 40-39. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP's hold may be weakened further early in 1995 when Johnson and possibly 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) run for the Orange County Senate seat 
vacated by Marian Bergeson, who was elected to the Board of Supervisors there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential for legislative inaction is great," said Assemblyman Phillip 
Isenberg (D-Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Joe Baca, who like Brulte hails from San Bernardino County, is one 
of several moderate Democrats Brulte has called in search of support. Baca said 
he asked Brulte to make him chairman of the Utilities and Commerce Committee. 
"He wants my vote, but he is not willing to promise me anything," Baca said. 
Unable to extract a commitment, Baca said he is undecided about his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he said, "I play poker." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brown may be out as Speaker, he will remain an influential Democrat, 
particularly when it comes to the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson needs to get two-thirds of the Assembly, or 54 votes, to win approval 
of his budget. Even if all 41 Republicans vote for a budget, itself unlikely, 
Brown would be called on to deliver 13 Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "How does Brulte get those 13 votes?" asked Tim Hodson, who directs the Center 
for California Studies at Cal State Sacramento. "He goes to Willie Brown and 
says, 'Help.' Willie Brown says, 'Here's my price.' His price will be a budget 
that doesn't destroy what he believes in." More on Legislature

CAPITOL JOURNAL: A DAY WHEN ONE VOTE WILL REALLY COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is "show-me" day in the Capitol. It's the day little-known Assemblyman 
Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga must show Democrats whether, in fact, he really 
has the 41 Republican votes to topple legendary Willie Brown as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 No more boasts, predictions or gloating over Nov. 8 election results. Just the 
votes. Republican votes. All 41 -- even peeved Paul Horcher's. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher, from Diamond Bar, crossed his GOP colleagues two years ago by 
accepting Brown's appointment to a coveted committee vice chairmanship. Brulte, 
then the new minority leader, had recommended another Republican favored by the 
GOP caucus. The wily Speaker was teaching Brulte manners and was making 
mischief. Republicans got so riled they treated Horcher like dirt, childishly 
shunning him as an outcast for the entire legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Horcher can take his revenge by withholding the 41st vote needed to elect 
a GOP Speaker. But he probably would be committing political suicide, inviting 
a recall by the GOP voters who sent him to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 24 years of Republicans being in the minority, I can't imagine how 
anybody -- no matter how mad or how dumb -- could refuse to vote for a 
Republican as Speaker," observes Senate GOP Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds are that Horcher, in the end, will vote for Brulte. It was Brulte, 
after all, who saved him from being booted completely out of the GOP caucus. 
But Horcher has gone into hiding. And if he doesn't vote for Brulte, it's not 
likely any Democrat will either. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte needs to show the 39 Democrats that the GOP can sweep them out of power 
without any treasonous help from themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone either has 41 votes or he doesn't," notes Assemblyman Louis Caldera, 
a rising Democratic star who represents Downtown Los Angeles. "If Jim Brulte 
has 41 Republican votes, then there are some Democrats who should consider 
voting for him as a show of good faith. I would consider that. But I'm not 
going to be his 41st vote. I'll be surprised if any Democrat breaks ranks to be 
the 41st vote for Jim Brulte." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is the sort of fix Brulte had in mind last fall when he privately was 
telling people that his "worst nightmare" was to wake up on Nov. 9 and learn 
that 41 Republicans had been elected to the Assembly. He was only half joking. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, he said, Republicans would gain six seats and have 39. They then 
could exert more pressure on Brown, demand better committee assignments and 
plot for a solid majority after 1996. But 41 Republicans were a very shaky 
majority, especially when they included the unpredictable Horcher and one 
member (Richard L. Mountjoy of Arcadia) destined soon to leave for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nailing down the speakership could be tricky enough, Brulte realized. But that 
would be easy compared to actually running the house while watching your 
backside for festering coups. It was a formula made for gridlock: Only a 
one-vote majority and a lame-duck Speaker confined by term limits to a two-year 
reign. 
</P>
<P>
 To aggravate matters, Democrats control the Senate, also by a one-vote 
majority. The Legislature hardly could be more evenly divided. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Republican Speaker assumed the post under similar circumstances, but 
without the term limits. He lasted only two years anyway because Democrats 
regained control at the next election. Like Brulte, GOP Speaker Bob Monagan in 
1969 succeeded a legend: Jesse (Big Daddy) Unruh. 
</P>
<P>
 To survive, Monagan gave four Democrats committee chairmanships. "Brulte needs 
to build alliances with responsible Democrats," Monagan says. "They've felt the 
public wrath in this election. So they might be willing to work with 
Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 But will Horcher? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte, 38, is a shrewd, skillful operator with a disarming, jovial 
personality. A former White House advance man, he has been active politically 
most of his life, having acquired the bug as a 10-year-old slapping on bumper 
stickers in Ronald Reagan's first gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 He's more pragmatic than ideological, a conservative whose chief cause -- 
besides Republican success -- is boosting the economy. On social issues, he's a 
GOP centrist -- approving of abortion in cases of rape, incest and threat to a 
mother's life and favoring a classroom moment of silence rather than prayer. Of 
far more interest to him are environmental, regulatory and tort "reform," all 
through the eyes of business. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brulte has not yet really been tested. Playing opposition leader is a snap 
compared to prevailing as Speaker and finessing bills through a closely divided 
house. And his first test will be to count 41 Republicans. If he can't, it's 
gridlock already.

CLINTON TO MAKE QUICK STOP AT EUROPEAN SUMMIT; DIPLOMACY: PRESIDENT WILL SPEND 
ONLY SIX HOURS AT TWO-DAY SECURITY CONFERENCE. THAT REFLECTS U.S. AMBIVALENCE 
ABOUT ITS ROLE IN CONTINENT'S FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the bloodiest European war in almost half a century raging nearby and 
America's post-Cold War relationship with Russia turning a bit chilly, 
President Clinton will swoop in here today to reassert a U.S. role in Europe's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton plans to spend just six hours at the two-day summit of the 
53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a schedule that is 
symbolic of Washington's ambivalence about its place in European affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrived in Budapest on Sunday in 
advance of the President, hopes to turn the CSCE -- which includes the United 
States, Canada and almost every European nation -- into a forum capable of 
heading off ethnic wars like the one in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Most U.S. officials, however, concede that the CSCE, created in the mid-1970s 
as a Cold War bridge between East and West, has a long way to go before it 
reaches that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said Sunday that Washington wants the CSCE to have a military 
peacekeeping role similar to that of the United Nations' "blue helmet" forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strengthened CSCE with some peacekeeping formula under which they would be 
able to engage the armed forces of various countries can make them effective," 
Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Bosnia has been such a tragedy . . . should not cause us to 
simply throw up our hands and fail to engage in conflict resolution wherever we 
can, wherever conflicts arise, and the earlier the better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is far from clear how a CSCE-established peacekeeping force could be 
more effective than the U.N. force, which has failed to exert the military 
muscle needed to force the warring factions in Bosnia to make peace. Unlike the 
United Nations, where the 15-nation Security Council controls peacekeeping 
operations, the CSCE operates by consensus, meaning that a single member can 
veto any activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the first test of CSCE peacekeeping probably will be an effort to 
resolve the conflict between the former Soviet republics of Armenia and 
Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Other ethnic conflicts 
in the former Soviet Union are also candidates for CSCE peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 But some U.S. officials are concerned that Russia might try to dominate such a 
force, in effect using the CSCE as a cover for solidifying its influence 
throughout the former Soviet empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said the Russians should be allowed to contribute something less 
than half of the troops in any CSCE force. But it is not clear where the rest 
of the soldiers would come from. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kornblum, a top State Department expert on Europe, said that several 
nations have expressed interest in contributing troops to a CSCE force in 
Nagorno-Karabakh and other post-Soviet hot spots. But he did not name any of 
them and said it was unlikely that the United States would participate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Russia is advancing a newly assertive foreign policy that 
could interfere with U.S. interests, although no one expects the situation to 
reach Cold War-style tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's refusal by Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev to 
participate in a long-scheduled ceremony intended to mark military cooperation 
between Moscow and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was only the latest 
and most visible example of U.S.-Russian friction. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin has proposed giving the CSCE authority over 
all regional security matters and abolishing NATO, the military alliance that 
the United States considers the anchor of its policy in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher insisted that there is no realistic danger of the abolition of 
NATO. He said U.S.-Russian relations remain basically sound, although he 
admitted: "We'll always have areas of disagreement. . . . We'll always have 
things to talk through and work through together, as two major powers naturally 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The CSCE summit, coming on the heels of a contentious meeting of NATO foreign 
ministers last week in Brussels, underscores the evolving nature of 
Washington's relationship with Europe. From the U.S. standpoint, NATO and the 
CSCE are the key European institutions because they are the only ones in which 
the United States is a full member. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Clinton's short schedule in Budapest has raised some questions 
about the importance that the United States attaches to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, however, said, "The fact that he is coming at all, and the fact 
that he is going through schedule contortions to be here, is a reflection of 
his interest and concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike during the Cold War years, the United States has indicated that it is 
not willing to routinely take the serious military risks that have been 
required for NATO leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 David P. Calleo, director of European studies at the School of Advanced 
International Studies of Johns Hopkins University, said it is time for the 
United States to play a lesser role in NATO and in the defense of Europe 
generally. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Washington should "not pretend to be playing the old role and then not 
do it. . . . What causes the bad feeling is to talk about playing the old role 
and not do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department's Kornblum, a former chief of the U.S. delegation to the 
CSCE, said the organization gives the United States and other democracies a 
framework for challenging human rights abuses in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CSCE was the first structure . . . which established that it was 
internationally acceptable to talk about behavior inside another country," 
Kornblum said. "It had been considered to be an absolute taboo. . . . This is 
very, very innovative." BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Created in the mid-1970s as a forum for East-West dialogue, the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe includes nearly all European states, the 
United States and Canada. It started with 35 members, but the collapse of the 
Soviet Union swelled its ranks. It now comprises 53 nations, although the 
membership of the rump Yugoslav state has been suspended. The group has no 
military structure or armed forces of its own but works to ease tensions and 
help prevent conflicts. It can act only if all members agree, and this 
principle of consensus has brought charges that it is unwieldy and ineffective. 
But it is the only security body to include nearly all states in Europe and 
link them with North America. The CSCE has helped to coordinate the enforcement 
of U.N. sanctions against the rump Yugoslav state and sent small missions to 
help ease tensions in the Baltic republics, Tajikistan, Georgia, Moldova, the 
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia and Ukraine. It is headquartered in 
Prague, Czech Republic, and a committee of officials meets every week in Vienna 
to discuss key issues. Summits are held every two years.

3 ARE KILLED, 21 WOUNDED AS GUNMEN ATTACK SWEDISH DISCO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunmen fired on a trendy nightclub here early Sunday, killing three people and 
wounding 21. Police believe the killers were looking for revenge after being 
turned away from the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The slayings were the latest in a string of murders that have shocked Sweden, 
which once experienced very little violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Police raided the apartment of one suspect in a working-class neighborhood 
south of the capital, but no one was there. Police said two other men also were 
involved in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen, dressed in military camouflage jackets, fired an automatic rifle 
through the doors and windows of the Sture Company discotheque at 5:15 a.m., 
about an hour after a dispute with the club's doormen, said police spokesman 
Walter Kegoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several people were turned away by the doormen earlier, and a scuffle broke 
out. They came back later," Kegoe said. 
</P>
<P>
 People inside the central Stockholm disco said the shooting set off a panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I walked down the stairs, I saw blood spurting everywhere," one man told 
Swedish TV. "Then I saw people just fall everywhere, and then I heard people 
say 'Run!' so we ran back into the club." 
</P>
<P>
 A doorman and two women were killed, police said. At least two of the wounded 
were in critical condition.

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: CLINTON DRAWING VISIONARY BLUEPRINT OF GLOBAL ECONOMY; HE 
CLEARS PATH FOR U.S. TO TAP INTO VIBRANT ECONOMIES AS HE HEADS FOR HEMISPHERIC 
SUMMIT IN MIAMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald Brownstein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his congressional victory on the world trade treaty behind him and a 
market-opening hemispheric summit convening Friday in Miami, President Clinton 
is compiling a more ambitious record of trade liberalization than any President 
since at least Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
 This record inverts the predictions -- common here and even more so abroad -- 
that Clinton's election would give protectionists the reins over U.S. trade 
policy. Today, the spearhead of protectionism is a conservative populist 
movement led by Ross Perot and Patrick J. Buchanan. (Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole's painful hesitation before finally endorsing GATT was a weather vane of 
their growing clout in the Republican Party.) And it is Clinton who is 
sketching the expansive, even visionary, blueprint of a new architecture to 
guide international economic relations into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 The first piece came last year when Congress approved the North American Free 
Trade Agreement linking Mexico and Canada with the United States; the second 
last week, when Congress approved the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
which should cut tariffs worldwide by more than a third. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially, the next two steps are even more sweeping. Last month, Clinton -- 
and Indonesian President Suharto -- steered 17 Pacific Rim nations, including 
China and Japan, toward a broad commitment to eliminate trade barriers in the 
region over the next quarter of a century. This Friday, 33 Caribbean, Central 
and South American nations will gather at the Summit of the Americas, where 
they are expected to endorse a free-trade zone stretching through the Western 
Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton can't take all the credit for this. The GATT train began chugging 
under President Ronald Reagan; President George Bush negotiated the heart of 
NAFTA and fleetingly floated wider arrangements in Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Clinton who carried the NAFTA and GATT initiatives past 
international and congressional hurdles to conclusion. And he has planted the 
seeds for agreements that, if fulfilled, would reshape our economic dealings 
with the world's two fastest growing regions -- Asia and Latin America. "It 
adds up to a pretty substantial achievement," said I.M. Destler, a trade 
scholar at the Institute for International Economics. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in the Clinton Administration underestimates the practical difficulties 
of putting flesh on free-trade visions across Asia and the Americas. While 
Latin American countries are generally enthusiastic about uniting with the 
United States, the frustration attending U.S. efforts to open markets in China 
and Japan could foreshadow what's ahead in Asia. "Integrating the Latin 
American countries won't be that hard," said C. Michael Aho, senior 
international economist for Prudential Securities Inc. "The real problem is 
going to be South Korea, Japan, China." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is not without leverage in these discussions: Most Asian 
countries want the United States to maintain a strong military presence in the 
region -- partly as an offset to China -- and enhanced market access could be 
at least an implicit quid pro quo. (Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
suggested as much at the first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in 
Seattle last year.) And the move toward new trade ties is rooted in the same 
force that is prompting developing nations around the world to deregulate their 
domestic economies: hunger for the foreign investment that fuels development. 
"What's driving the quest for open trade . . . is a very competitive culture of 
economic liberalization," said Commerce Undersecretary Jeffrey E. Garten. "If 
it wasn't for that, we never would have gotten to this point." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the Latin and Asian countries are sincere, enormous difficulties 
remain in marrying into open trade zones economies and societies built on such 
divergent principles. The difficulty of bolstering environmental and labor 
standards in Mexico almost sank NAFTA; but Mexico is practically a workers' 
paradise compared to Asian countries like China, which suppresses basic civil 
liberties, or Malaysia and Indonesia, which deny the rights of workers to 
establish independent unions in key sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorting through all of this will take years. It's possible that such 
inevitably prolonged negotiations may become meaningless or even worse: an 
excuse for deferring action on immediately pressing problems, such as providing 
greater market access for American firms in Japan or China. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding such delays is one reason Administration officials understand that 
these efforts must demonstrate tangible progress along the way. In Asia, they 
envision advancing "horizontally" with regionwide agreements on questions such 
as an investment code and harmonizing technical standards; in Latin America 
they want to proceed "vertically" by adding countries sequentially to NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can predict whether Clinton's successors will reach the finish line of 
free trade throughout this hemisphere, much less across the deeper cultural and 
economic divides that separate us from Asia. But with America searching for 
foreign policy principles to replace the obliterated moorings of the Cold War, 
even setting the goal provides order and direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of an expanding hemispheric free-trade zone through South America 
could reinforce economic reform and democracy throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia, the stakes are even larger. Japanese companies are now better 
positioned than American firms to profit from dynamic Asian growth; by 
unmistakably signaling America's commitment to the market, the APEC 
negotiations should encourage U.S. firms to follow the flag with investment and 
trade. At the same time, the project should preempt exclusionary efforts to 
form an Asia-only bloc, and reassure Asians that America remains committed to 
the region's stability and balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Clinton's trade agenda will be judged less for its impact on 
political stability abroad than its contribution to opportunity at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressional fights over NAFTA and GATT underscored the skepticism that 
many Americans feel about lowering trade barriers at a time when wages are 
already stagnant or slipping. Those fears shouldn't be dismissed: While 
economists disagree on the magnitude, it is difficult to deny that absorbing 
millions of Third World workers into the world economy will intensify the 
downward pressure on wages, especially for American workers without advanced 
training and education. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no turning off the globalization process creating those 
competitors in Mexico or China; it would continue if the United States voted 
down GATT and dissolved NAFTA. The real question is how America can prosper in 
this difficult new world economic order. 
</P>
<P>
 Any long-term project to lower trade barriers adds to the urgency of greater 
public investment in training and education (although Clinton may have 
difficulty convincing the new Republican Congress). But unless America can 
export more to the rising nations that are manufacturing products that used to 
be built here, we are unlikely to generate new jobs to replace those inexorably 
drifting to lower-wage countries. Today, Asian and Latin American nations are 
in the market for the ligatures of modernization -- telecommunications systems, 
roads, power plants, hospitals -- and eventually a growing middle-class will 
open its wallets for Jeeps, software and movies. America can't prosper without 
securing its share of those sales. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when protectionist pressures are growing, Clinton has grasped that 
main point. Notwithstanding all the practical and political hurdles that loom 
ahead, he is clearing a path for the United States to tap into the world's most 
vibrant economies. If he has hesitated on other foreign policy challenges, in 
this contentious arena Clinton is doing precisely what a President is supposed 
to do: attacking insecurity by confidently defining the future. Trade Trouble 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is trying to broaden American access to some of the world's 
fastest-growing economies. Our economic relations with many of these nations 
are seriously unbalanced: The United States is running a cumulative merchandise 
trade deficit with the APEC nations and those that will gather this week in 
Miami for the summit. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. merchandise trade balances, January-September, 1994 (in millions of 
dollars) Deficit APEC*: -91,712 Japan: -47,268 China: -21,089 Canada: -9,503 
Summit*: -7,100 S. Korea: -1,447 Brazil: -1,212 Surplus Chile: +547 Hong Kong: 
+1,483 Mexico: +1,796 Argentina: +2,010 Australia: +4,860 * Includes all 
countries in the prospective trade zone.

ACHILLE LAURO SURVIVORS PRAISE CREW; DISASTER: CRUISE DIRECTOR'S EFFORTS ARE 
HAILED. SOME OF THOSE RESCUED FROM THE SHIP ARRIVE IN DJIBOUTI AND KENYA.

 Survivors from the Achille Lauro luxury liner, which caught fire and sank, 
said they owe their lives to the ship's cruise director and her staff, who 
calmly shepherded passengers into groups for evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire broke out early Wednesday in the ship's engine room, and the Achille 
Lauro sank 125 miles off the coast of Somalia after a final explosion ripped 
through its bow at dusk Friday. The ship had been on a cruise from Italy to 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour guides Renate Strumberger and Elfi Hettwer, speaking aboard the 
Gettysburg, a U.S. guided-missile cruiser, said Nadia Eckhard, the South 
African cruise director, was the heroine in the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nadia and her team, both South Africans and Britons, whose job really was to 
organize entertainment and everyday life for the passengers, is the real 
heroine of the fire," Hettwer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They organized the passengers into nationality groups so everyone would 
understand orders in their own language, and they're the ones who really 
handled the evacuation," said Hettwer, who is from Bamberg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Other survivors who have arrived at the Red Sea port of Djibouti told of their 
miraculous escape from the inferno that engulfed the Italian liner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most critical moment was putting the passengers into a lifeboat, and the 
ship behind us was burning," said South African Christopher Hills, an 
entertainer aboard the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the paint was peeling off the wall, and we were struggling to get them in 
fast enough . . . and suddenly you could feel the heat right behind you. It was 
a very frightening moment." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the crew helped passengers slide down ropes at the stern of the 
blazing ship. Some passengers fell into the sea, and crewmen dived in to save 
them. "There was a lot of confusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right away there was smoke everywhere, and the light dimmed," said South 
African passenger Peter Lategan. "I ran through the corridors to find my wife, 
and it kept getting darker and darker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doors were slamming everywhere -- probably fireproof doors closing the ship 
into sections," Lategan said. "That was awfully frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Achille Lauro crew members arrived Sunday in Mombasa, Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other ships carrying about 500 of the liner's passengers and crew members 
were expected Sunday night, and those survivors would disembark today, shipping 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian coast guard reported that an elderly Dutchwoman died after being 
rescued from the ship. Evernentia Spiekermann, 74, was the third passenger from 
the ill-fated cruise to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiekermann apparently suffered an intestinal blockage aboard the SKS Spirit, 
one of 10 ships taking the more than 900 Achille Lauro passengers and crew to 
African shores, coast guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other elderly passengers died in the incident. Arthur Morris of Britain 
was killed by a blow to the head as he tried to board a lifeboat, and Gerhard 
Szimke of Germany suffered a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly Dutchman remained unaccounted for in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Achille Lauro made headlines in 1985 when Palestinian guerrillas hijacked 
it in the Mediterranean, killed Jewish American passenger Leon Klinghoffer and 
dumped his body overboard.

PRESIDENT RESHUFFLES ALBANIA GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Sali Berisha dismissed eight Cabinet ministers Sunday and abolished 
seven ministries in the biggest government reshuffle since his Democratic Party 
of Albania came to power nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-expected reshuffle was announced a month after Albanian voters 
rejected a government draft constitution in a referendum.The moves, announced 
by Albanian state television, were the third alteration to Prime Minister 
Alexander Meksi's Cabinet since the Democrats won a landslide victory over what 
was then the Communist Party in parliamentary elections in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight ministers were dismissed, one resigned, seven ministries were abolished 
and four new ones were created in the reshuffle, state television reported. 
Berisha brought the governor of Albania's Central Bank into the government as 
finance minister. His replacement at the bank was not announced.

BAGHDAD WRONG TO INVADE KUWAIT, IRAQ OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A top Iraqi official has told a Swedish newspaper that the 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait was a serious mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement by Barzan Ibrahim Tikriti, a half brother of Saddam Hussein and 
head of Iraq's U.N. mission in Geneva, came in an exclusive interview published 
Sunday by Svenska Dagbladet. It was the first time a high-level official has 
admitted publicly that the invasion was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's regrettable that Iraq invaded Kuwait," Tikriti said. "I wish it would 
not have happened since the consequences have been terrible for the Iraqi 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 He expressed frustration over the United States' unwillingness to talk to 
Iraq, which last month officially recognized Kuwait's borders and independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They refuse to see us, but the United States is willing to meet with 
dictators like North Korea's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do everything we can to put things right again. The United States and Iraq 
cannot continue to be enemies; we need each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Tikriti is the youngest of Hussein's three half brothers from his mother's 
second marriage. His father is a brother of Hussein's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Tikriti has had his ups and downs with Hussein, but the blood relationship 
seems to have endured. According to Western intelligence agencies and Iraqi 
defectors, he heads Hussein's intelligence network in Europe, one of the key 
links in the Iraqi leader's terror apparatus, and handles the family's 
investments abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for the United States and Iraq to normalize relations," he said in 
the interview. "We want to have an open and honest dialogue with the Americans. 
. . . There is no longer need for tough sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has led opposition to the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed 
on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in August, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Tikriti has been shunned by the diplomatic community in Geneva, which 
considers him little more than a thug dressed as a diplomat. He once beat up 
his chauffeur at a diplomatic reception when the man was late picking Tikriti 
up.

SUSPECTED SUICIDE BOMBER WOUNDED IN GAZA STRIP

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Palestinian carrying a bomb in a backpack was wounded in a failed suicide 
attack Sunday when his explosives only partially exploded near an Israeli 
checkpoint and troops opened fire, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker, identified as 26-year-old Mahmoud Sharif of Gaza City, 
reportedly ignored orders to stop as he approached troops checking papers of 
Palestinians crossing the Gaza Strip's northernmost checkpoint into Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharif apparently set off the detonator of a bomb he was carrying in his 
backpack, prompting soldiers to open fire, the army said. He was hospitalized 
with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Army sources said the attacker, who had no permit to enter Israel, carried a 
makeshift bomb built of cans and nails.

NATIONAL BOYCOTT OF CALIFORNIA OVER PROP. 187 MAY BROADEN

<P>
 Activists planning a national boycott of California over its anti-immigration 
measure said Sunday that they may also target Disney, Chevron, ARCO, and 
Mervyn's department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the corporations contributed to Republican Gov. Pete Wilson or 
the Proposition 187 campaign.Wilson's strong endorsement of the ballot measure 
helped his Nov. 8 reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which is on hold pending court challenges, denies educational, 
health and other benefits to illegal immigrants.

 Some organizations, including a Latino journalists' group and the Mexico 
City-based World Boxing Council, have already canceled meetings they had 
planned in California.

GOP REPORT ON ARMED SERVICES FINDS U.S. READINESS SAGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. military readiness is sagging across all the armed services, according to 
a new Republican assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, released Sunday, found Army tank crews forced to pretend they were 
driving their tanks during training exercises, tank commanders put in the field 
before they had trained with their platoons and Air Force crews in Europe badly 
overextended by missions over Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, by Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), also said 28 Marine and Navy 
tactical air squadrons were forced to ground half their planes in September, 
and it found a decline in readiness ratings for ships in the Atlantic and 
Pacific fleets. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence, who is set to become chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, 
disputed Clinton Administration claims that below-par military preparedness has 
turned up only in isolated instances. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-page report signals that congressional Republicans aren't ready to 
accept President Clinton's assurances that the readiness problem is under 
control. It also signals that Republicans are dissatisfied with Clinton's 
proposal last week to pump $25 billion more into defense spending over the next 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said unexpected overseas actions in Haiti, Cuba and 
the Persian Gulf late in the fiscal year sapped training funds for backup 
units.

INJURED WHALE STRAYS INTO DELAWARE RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An injured right whale that took a wrong turn ended up in the Delaware River, 
swimming in slow circles as rescuers tried Sunday to steer it back toward the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 The young mammal, which may have been separated from its mother, strayed north 
into Delaware Bay instead of moving south for winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The whale's head was bleeding from an apparent run-in with a boat during its 
80-mile trek from the mouth of the bay at Lewes, Del., to Philadelphia, where 
it was first spotted Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or it could have been hit out in the ocean, possibly resulting in some 
disorientation," said Bob Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding 
Unit in Brigantine, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-foot whale appeared to be lethargic and could be hungry, Schoelkopf 
said from a police boat. He said it appeared to be about a year old. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine biologists had guided the whale to within about 60 miles of the 
Atlantic by Sunday night. But Schoelkopf wasn't sure whether the animal would 
reach the ocean before dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther south, officials were monitoring a second whale that was meandering in 
the Potomac River, the Coast Guard said. They were trying to determine if the 
two whales were related.

MAN STABBED WITH GOLF CLUB SHAFT, LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man miraculously survived being beaten, stabbed, choked and having a broken 
golf club shaft jammed through his head, police and hospital officials said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Delongchamp was listed in critical condition Sunday at Highland 
Hospital, where doctors had to surgically remove the shaft, spokesman Marty 
Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can thank God he is alive," Boyer said. "He was extremely lucky the shaft 
did not hit one of the two main arteries that feed blood to the brain. It 
appears he had one tremendous stroke of luck, but it's too soon to tell if 
he'll survive this unscathed." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Delongchamp was attacked for almost two hours by his roommate, 
Daniel E. Bauer, 29, who eventually called police and was taking a shower to 
wash off blood when officers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer has admitted attacking Delongchamp sometime after midnight Thursday 
after the men got into an argument over marijuana, but then called police 
because "his roommate told him he wanted to live," Police Sgt. Mike Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer started beating Delongchamp in the head with a marijuana pipe and it 
broke, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant got a golf putter he had given Delongchamp and beat him with it, 
Clark said, and when the club head broke off, he shoved the shaft into 
Delongchamp's head behind the ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer was booked for investigation of attempted murder.

SEARCH CONTINUES FOR 3 MISSING ON PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Search teams canvassed the Kern County area Sunday in hopes of learning what 
had happened to three Long Beach men aboard a single-engine plane missing for a 
week after an apparent crash, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the day's efforts provided few new leads, and bad weather in the region 
grounded air crews for a second consecutive day, said Lt. Col. Sydney J. Wolfe 
of the Civil Air Patrol. Because of stormy weather, officials do not expect to 
resume air searches for the trio until Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing are pilot Peter J. Deleo, 33, and two passengers, Waverly Hatch, 49, 
and Lloyd Matsumoto, 55. Wolfe said the three men left Long Beach Airport on 
Nov. 27.

MOORHEAD OVERLOOKED BUT UNBOWED; CONGRESS: LONGTIME LAWMAKER'S AMIABLE NATURE 
COST HIM KEY COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Newt Gingrich's eyes, Rep. Carlos Moorhead was just too nice a guy. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though Moorhead's gentle, congenial nature cost him the chairmanship 
of a key congressional committee, it's one thing he won't give up. Ever the 
good foot soldier, the get-along guy refuses to bad mouth Gingrich (R-Ga.), the 
incoming House Speaker who decided that despite 22 years in Congress' minority 
party, Moorhead wasn't aggressive enough to be one of the top power brokers in 
a new Republican era. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his shortcomings in the eyes of Gingrich, Moorhead said, "I just don't 
want to be a mean person." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead has been on an emotional roller coaster since the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, Moorhead won his 12th term at age 72, and a Republican wave swept 
the nation, giving the GOP control of the House of Representatives for the 
first time in 40 years. Moorhead would be part of the in crowd after laboring 
for decades in a House dominated by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Moorhead was 
in line to be appointed chairman, with the power to steer debate on a broad 
range of business, health, environment and technology issues. Moorhead also was 
the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee but had agreed to forgo 
the chairmanship of that committee because he was more interested in Energy and 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hard-nosed Gingrich was dealing the cards and the time-honored 
seniority system of appointing committee chairmen went out the window as it has 
on occasion over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich told Moorhead he would have to be satisfied with a chairmanship of a 
judiciary subcommittee on intellectual property, which handles copyright 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think mine is a little different style perhaps than what Mr. Gingrich is 
looking for," said Moorhead, who is known for encouraging bipartisan 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Moorhead said he is satisfied with the subcommittee 
chairmanship, which will enable him to influence copyright issues, an important 
topic in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to tell you I think I shouldn't have had it (the committee 
chairmanship), because I do," said Moorhead, whose district includes Pasadena, 
Glendale and Burbank. "But there is something to be said for the new leadership 
of the Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the election in 1996 will tell what kind of damage the intraparty 
jostling will have on Moorhead's political future should he decide to seek a 
13th term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it was handled didn't have anything to do with his ability or 
record," said political scientist Larry Berg of USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead, who has a reputation as a staunchly conservative, hard-working but 
dull politician, was first elected to the state Assembly in 1966. He won two 
more terms in the Assembly before winning a seat in Congress in 1972 at the age 
of 50. 
</P>
<P>
 He first made a name for himself as a member of the House Judiciary Committee 
in 1974. He was part of a minority voting against the first article of 
impeachment against former President Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last-ditch defenders of Nixon, Moorhead admitted after the 
President resigned that the evidence against him was damning. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmaker has backed one conservative cause after another over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, he was targeted for defeat by the National Organization for Women 
because he voted against an attempt to revive the Equal Rights Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 He voted for aid to the Contras in Nicaragua and was a strong backer of the 
"Star Wars" Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Moorhead voted against the Clinton Administration crime bill, 
which included a ban on assault rifles. He also opposed President Clinton's 
proposal to have employers pay for employees' health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Moorhead consistently draws rave reviews from conservative 
interest groups, while receiving failing grades from liberal groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorhead generally avoids the spotlight in favor of spending a lot of time 
on committee assignments on technical issues. His tendency to be a low-key 
lawmaker has cost him points with his own party over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Moorhead survived a challenge by Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. 
(R-Va.) to assume the coveted position of the ranking Republican on the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee. Moorhead was next in line to succeed retiring 
Rep. Norman R. Lent (R-N.Y.), but Bliley portrayed himself as a stronger 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich now has chosen Bliley over Moorhead to chair the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that matters now, Moorhead said. He is looking forward to supporting 
the "Republican Contract with America" when Congress reconvenes. The contract, 
drafted by Gingrich, urges passage of a balanced-budget amendment, term limits 
for members of Congress, welfare reform and tax-reduction measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican Party has a big job to do," Moorhead said.

MAN OBSESSED WITH VICTIM, FRIENDS SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>

 A Canoga Park man arrested on suspicion of stabbing his former girlfriend -- a 
woman he shot in 1991 -- was described Sunday by family and friends as a family 
man with a dark obsession with his victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Dale Harden, 54, who was released from state prison a month ago, is 
accused of chasing down and stabbing Diane Pierce-Hamrick, 49, Saturday outside 
her apartment in the 8200 block of Owensmouth Avenue in Canoga Park, said Los 
Angeles Police Officer Vic Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce-Hamrick remained in critical condition at a local hospital Sunday, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harden was arrested Saturday after he showed up at his sister's house in 
Fontana covered with blood and with a stab wound to his leg, said Sgt. Terry 
Boess of the Fontana Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how Harden was injured, Boess added. 
</P>
<P>
 Harden was treated and released at a local hospital before being arrested, 
Boess said. He is being held at Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $500,000 
bail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harden's sister, Barbara La Clair, said Harden and Pierce-Hamrick had lived 
together for 20 years and raised Pierce-Hamrick's three children and Harden's 
two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really a family man," said La Clair, who added that Harden worked hard 
to support both his step- and natural children. "But then he just turned into 
this different personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Don and Jean Smith of Canoga Park, longtime friends of Harden, said the 
couple's rocky relationship initially ended in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce-Hamrick "had a lot of problems and he was always there to help her," 
said Jean Smith, a confidant of Harden's. "They had a rough relationship in the 
end because she lost a son and her daughter was burned in a car accident." 
</P>
<P>
 After the breakup, Smith said, Harden learned that Pierce-Hamrick was dating 
another man. Consumed with jealousy, he shot her. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce-Hamrick recovered from her injuries and Harden was sent to prison, said 
Don Smith. While in prison, Harden kept in touch with the Smiths. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was tormented," Jean Smith said. "He was having nightmares and 
dreaming of her in prison. He was obsessed with her." 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved her and he hated her," said Don Smith, who rented a room to Harden 
and worked with him at his construction business. "He just couldn't let her 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Harden and Pierce-Hamrick were estranged while he was in prison, they 
attempted a reconciliation during Thanksgiving -- despite a special restriction 
in Harden's parole to stay away from Pierce-Hamrick, family and friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parole office was very shocked that she would write a letter saying it 
was OK for him to come around her," Don Smith said. "She opened the door for 
him and he took advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Police speculate that Pierce-Hamrick may have tried to end the relationship 
when Harden attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had another side to him," Jean Smith said. "A dark side that was violent. 
I never saw it, but he spoke of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved him," said Don Smith, "but I don't condone any kind of violence. We 
feel responsible because he was here at our home. We had no idea what he was 
going to do."

WEEKDAY GETAWAY; CHATSWORTH LAKE RESIDENTS AVOID CONGESTION OF CITY LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The narrow, bumpy streets are glorified trails that dip and wind and dead-end 
abruptly. Many of them are posted with ominous signs that warn outsiders to 
"Keep Out, Private Road." Yards are cluttered with a life's collection of 
stuff. Cannibalized cars and trucks dot lots. Barking dogs are often the only 
signs of life. 
</P>
<P>
 You have entered Chatsworth Lake, an enclave 10 minutes west of Chatsworth 
that straddles the Ventura-Los Angeles County line. If time didn't completely 
forget the place, it's at least a few hours behind the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable television is available, but not natural gas or a sewer system. There is 
one small market, but no gas station. There are no sidewalks and few street 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is why folks live here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved here to get away from all the b.s. down below," said Julius Seregi, 
71, who moved to the area in the late 1950s. "As long as people don't bother 
me, I don't bother them." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love it here," said Candece Deanne, 27, an art student who moved here 
four years ago. "It's away from the city. It's very quiet. You don't hear any 
car noises or police sirens. It's like being out in the country, but yet the 
city is really close." 
</P>
<P>
 The eclectic nature of Chatsworth Lake -- which lies just north of the now dry 
Chatsworth Lake Reservoir and south of Simi Valley -- is seen in its people, 
houses and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a place for families with children, as well as members of the Hells 
Angels motorcycle club. Modern $200,000 multistory homes are next door to 
50-year-old ramshackle buildings. Ford Broncos are parked alongside faded 
pickup trucks with cracked, deflated tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have named streets after loved ones, such as Sara Lynn Drive and Ida 
Place, while others have sought to make a statement with their street names, 
such as My Way Lane and Corvette Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a unique area," said Los Angeles County Fire Engineer Duane Swanson, who 
has been based at Fire Station 75 on Lake Manor Drive in the heart of the 
community since 1981. "They are canyon people just like those who live in 
Topanga Canyon or Kagel Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most folks here keep to themselves, three years ago residents rallied 
together to persuade Los Angeles County supervisors not to close their fire 
station as part of proposed budget cuts. The station also serves the Ventura 
County side of the community, even though emergency calls are handled through a 
Ventura County fire dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood was founded in the 1920s as a weekend getaway spot. Lots were 
subdivided into tiny 25-by-70-foot parcels suitable for cabins and sold for as 
little as $25, according to an old sales brochure that called the area 
Chatsworth Lake View Place and Chatsworth Highland Springs at that time. The 
area has also been called Lake Manor. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochure gave directions to the site as "Hollywood to Sherman Way in 
Lankershim, follow the Pacific Electric tracks to Owensmouth, turn right at 
railroad station to Chatsworth or until you see our signs." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Shirley's father bought a lot in 1927, and Shirley himself moved there 
permanently 15 years ago.

 "My dad bought the land when I was 9," Shirley, now 76, recalled. "It was 
totally country, full of brush and rattlesnakes and rabbits. I still love it up 
here. We're above the smog, and we can look down over the orange blanket. It's 
always been marvelous for fresh air and sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, the area was a rustic getaway for actors working on 
location shooting Westerns. Water filled Chatsworth Lake back then, and the 
celebrities could enjoy it in privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The area remained mostly undeveloped through the 1970s, inhabited "mostly by 
outlaws and artists," according to real estate agent Bob Wood, who lives in Box 
Canyon and has sold property in the area since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said that newer homes began popping up on empty lots in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 During the building boom, many of the small lots were combined to accommodate 
larger houses for more affluent residents. Currently, there are about 500 homes 
with about 2,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For some unexplained reason, residents here seem to collect inoperable cars. 
Some people cover them and park them in their yards. But others, lacking space, 
just keep them on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Deanne owns four old Mercedes-Benz sedans, but only one runs. The others line 
the street. "My friend and I were going to work on them, but we just haven't 
got around to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some longtime residents are not happy with the new neighborhood growth, 
complaining that it has destroyed the peaceful nature of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 One 26-year resident of the area, who asked that her name not be used, 
complained that traffic takes a shortcut through the neighborhood because the 
city of Los Angeles never built a Valley Circle Boulevard detour out of her 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most residents find Chatsworth Lake still to be the quiet getaway 
advertised in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no graffiti, there are no drive-bys, there is virtually no crime," 
Wood said. "And it is not a problem that the roads are bumpy because they keep 
out the outsiders."

4,000 MARCH IN CHAMBER'S HOLIDAY PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of San Fernando Valley residents -- toting chairs, blankets and 
containers of hot cocoa -- lined Chatsworth Street in Granada Hills on Sunday 
for the 11th annual Holiday Parade.This year's festivities included 4,000 
participants from more than 150 groups, making it the Granada Hills Chamber of 
Commerce's largest parade to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark and Caren Pinson were among the first to stake out a prime curbside spot. 
Although they've been coming to the parade for years to watch some of their 
eight children march through the streets, this was the first year that the 
entire brood made it onto one float. "One way or another, they've all been 
involved," Mark Pinson said.

LANCASTER COUPLE MISSING; CRIME: SHERIFF LAUNCHES MURDER INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF CARLOS AND DELIA GUEVERA. A BULLET WAS FOUND LODGED IN THE 
WALL OF THEIR HOME.

<P>
 The suspicious disappearance of a young Lancaster couple four days ago has 
prompted Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies to launch a murder 
investigation, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was sparked by the discovery of a bullet lodged in a wall at 
the home of Carlos and Delia Guevera in the 42000 block of Alep Street, Deputy 
Rich Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies found the bullet after they entered the house to check on the couple. 
A friend reported the Gueveras missing Saturday after neither reported to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Delia Esther Guevera, 26, is an assistant manager at a Palmdale fast-food 
restaurant, a co-worker confirmed. Her husband, Carlos, also 26, works at a 
Best Buy retail store near the Antelope Valley Mall, said Deputy Brian Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's car, a maroon 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, was reported missing as was 
personal property from the home, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to neighbors, the couple had only lived at the home a couple of 
months and kept to themselves most of the time. They had installed automatic 
lighting and sprinkler systems that made it difficult to tell when they were 
home, said a neighbor who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cleaned out the yard, did improvements on the house and that was about 
it," the neighbor said, adding that he saw visitors at the couple's home only 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Guevera was described as about 5-foot-8, 170 pounds with black hair and 
brown eyes. Delia was described as 5-foot-8, 130 pounds with brown hair and 
brown eyes.

COALITION WORKING ON MASTER PLAN TO TACKLE YOUTH PROBLEMS; SANTA CLARITA 
VALLEY: SERVICE AGENCIES, CHURCHES AND EDUCATORS ARE CREATING A 20-YEAR 
BLUEPRINT COVERING TOPICS FROM PRENATAL HEALTH CARE TO KEEPING YOUTHS AWAY FROM 
GANGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The problems of youth -- from gang-banging to drunk driving -- have been the 
topics of countless studies and endless conversations. But now a coalition of 
service agencies, churches and educators in the Santa Clarita Valley is trying 
to solve the problems by working together. 
</P>
<P>
 They are formulating what they call a "Youth Master Plan," a sort of 20-year 
blueprint for the city's youth that will cover everything from prenatal health 
care to keeping youths away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the plan said that by working together they can make the effort 
more than just another set of unused guidelines and forgotten proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our church by itself cannot address all the problems," said Gary Sumner, 
youth pastor at Grace Baptist Church for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's parks and recreation department can't deal with it by themselves. 
The Sheriff's Department can't. The business community can't. It's going to 
take an integrated effort on all their parts to deal with these." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is modeled after a similar undertaking in Claremont, where projects 
such as a youth center to keep teen-agers from drinking and driving already 
have gotten under way. Organizers of the Claremont effort said they were one of 
the first small cities in the country to devise such a plan. Ten to 15 cities 
have expressed interest in duplicating it. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of Santa Clarita businesses, schools, churches and nonprofit 
organizations are right now trying to determine what the area's needs are, said 
Edward Redd, chairman of the master plan committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Several local youths also have been recruited. 
</P>
<P>
 The steering committee that will oversee development of the plan began meeting 
in November and asked residents this week to contact city officials if they 
wanted to participate. Public meetings will also be scheduled between now and 
February, when the actual plan is to be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner said he wants the plan to address the children of two-career and 
single-parent families. He said these children are often alone for much of the 
day as parents commute to and from Los Angeles. And when parents are around, 
they often are too tired to take an interest in their children's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 So some youths turn to drugs or gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, we've always been a conservative area, but now a lot of people 
are moving in from other areas to our valley," Sumner said. "There's also a 
disintegration within caused by a change of values." 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner suggested parenting classes and support groups -- both as a preventive 
measure and for those with troublesome children -- as options to include in the 
Master Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Placerita Junior High agreed that the city needs to offer more 
recreational activities and facilities to youths, both as a diversion and as a 
way to keep teen-agers away from gangs. Suggestions included an ice-skating 
rink, a larger mall and additional sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more groups that aren't costly so everyone can get into them," said 
Joanna May, 13, who was on her way to an after-school ballet and tap-dancing 
class. Many of her classmates said they were going home to empty houses and had 
no plans except homework. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bonita De Amicis, a member of the Santa Clarita Anti-Gang Task Force, said 
she hopes the master plan will make young people aware of the programs that 
already exist. For example, she said, more youths should take advantage of a 
Friday Night Live program that offers dances and other activities. She said 
young people also should help think of activities that would appeal to their 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager George Caravalho said the idea of a master plan surfaced in 
casual conversations more than a year ago. Recruiting community leaders to take 
part began about six months ago. He said that despite a tight budget, the city 
would be willing to make a substantial investment in the plan because it might 
save money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're spending a lot of money reacting to the problem on things such 
as law enforcement, absenteeism (from school), and putting police and security 
people on campus," he said. "What we have to say is we're going to make an 
investment in these people so they become taxpaying citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner said that his church might not be able to provide much money, but that 
he thinks many congregants would volunteer their time for projects. Redd said 
he hopes local businesses can be persuaded that contributing to the plan would 
be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 Advice for the master plan came from Anne Henry, one of two people in charge 
of the Claremont plan. She said larger cities such as Seattle have hired 
experts and prominent officials to draft such plans. But Claremont wanted one 
based on input from anyone interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry said Santa Clarita has an advantage over Claremont because it already 
knows what most of its problems are. But, she said, it will have a tougher time 
solving them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems there are probably more advanced than Claremont's are," she 
said. "Ours were more focused on prevention, not intervention. Santa Clarita 
will have to do a little bit of both." 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont spent $100,000 to remodel and reopen a building used as a teen 
center in the 1960s, which opened at the beginning of this school year, Henry 
said. She said about 300 to 400 youths have been at the center after recent 
football games. 
</P>
<P>
 And a pool of volunteer doctors is being established to handle prenatal and 
early childhood health care for young women. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers in Santa Clarita hope that by developing their master plan they 
will get youths interested in the process of implementing it, something that 
has often failed with other efforts, Redd said. If that happens, he said, the 
plan has a much greater chance of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids say this is not a youth-family community," he said. "I'd like to change 
that perception. We have to show the youth in this community we care about 
them."

FIRE IN LONG BEACH AUTO SHOP SENDS 3 TO HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine people were treated for smoke inhalation caused by a small but stubborn 
fire Sunday at a Toyota auto body shop in Long Beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, caused when a welder's torch ignited flammable oils, broke out 
about 9 a.m and was extinguished 30 minutes later by 50 firefighters, who had 
difficulty maneuvering hoses and equipment into a small spray booth where the 
fire started. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like working in a dungeon," said Battalion Chief Reed Bingham of the 
Long Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the victims were treated at the scene of the blaze, in the 6400 block 
of Paramount Boulevard, Bingham said, and the other three were taken to local 
hospitals, where they were reported in good condition.

NOTORIOUS? SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE; RUTH WEBB'S TALENT AGENCY REPS 'STARS' 
KNOWN FOR SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Joey Buttafuoco starring in comedies a la John Belushi? Tonya Harding wowing 
them in an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical? John Wayne Bobbitt -- well, doing 
anything on camera except looking vaguely stunned? 
</P>
<P>
 Watch out, Mike Ovitz. When it comes to never-say-never talent management, no 
one outstrips the Hollywood-based Ruth Webb Entertainment, Inc. "At first 
people thought I was kidding," cheerfully admits agent Sherri Spillane, who 
began Webb's new "scandal" division in June. The ranks have since swelled to 
include Buttafuoco, Harding, Bobbitt, Norma Jean (Cop-Turned-Call-Girl) 
Almodovar, Tammy Faye Bakker and Mayflower Madam Sydney Biddle Barrows. Kato 
Kaelin was recently, albeit briefly, also a client. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough crew, it seems at first, for genteel ladies such as Spillane and Webb. 
Not your typical Hollywood talent agents, they don't wear headsheets. They 
don't do lunch ("Cocktails, yes"). Offices are in Webb's Nichols Canyon home, 
where a parrot, raccoon and occasional peacock frolic before a clutter of 
chandeliers, Broadway posters and white shag carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know how it is to be the targets of media frenzy," Spillane says. History 
bears her out. Spillane danced on Broadway in the '60s, caused a ruckus dating 
Sammy Davis Jr., and posed nude on the cover of a book by her detective-story 
writer ex-husband, Mickey. Webb, whose first association with Spillane was as 
her theatrical agent, is no shrinking violet either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I was no-TOR-ious!" sings out 70-something former cabaret crooner Webb, in a 
dramatic style Spillane describes as "a combination Auntie Mame and Zsa-Zsa 
Gabor." "Both Sherri and I made headlines around the world! I was married to a 
guy named Albert Benajam -- 'In a Jam' Benajam. We were known in the press as 
'The Battling Benajams.' The Mafia put out a contract on me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the New York Daily Mirror headlines wielded are circa 1955, a 
time when an exceptionally bad apple might "spend the night in the pokey." 
Never mind that the talent listed on last year's promo sheet looks a bit 
creaky: Dorothy Lamour, Elke Sommer, Imogene Coca.  
</P>
<P>
 The point is, scandal is always scandal. Show business is always show 
business. They've done it all and can do it again. Spillane describes how she 
got the idea to combine the two: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching the whole Olympic scandal with Tonya and thinking to myself, 
'My God -- they are going after this girl like she was a Manson killer!' 
Totally blowing it out of proportion! Then one day we heard that a Lloyd Webber 
production -- 'Starlight Express' -- was going to Las Vegas." Her voice becomes 
irresistibly upbeat. "And I thought, 'We could turn Tonya's career around by 
putting her in a major skating show! We can give her a second chance!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Harding could well be the leading lady Andrew Lloyd Webber has come to 
deserve, but her image makeover into America's newest sweetheart is not in the 
bag yet. Her new boyfriend nixed a softball "Entertainment Tonight" interview 
on the set of "Breakaway," a low-budget film in which she had a small part. 
(Neither Harding nor her agents will say how much she was paid.) Her fan club 
just disbanded, citing Harding's repeated demands for money. Spillane admits 
those recent graphic Penthouse shots too were a setback, although she protests, 
"Tonya had nothing to do with them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the "notorious" talent roster are also coming along a little more 
slowly than the Ruth Webb Agency would like. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to do something with Kato Kaelin," Webb declares flatly. "Got him 
two auditions and he can't act. He flunked out." 
</P>
<P>
 "He just went on one," says Spillane, struggling to her ex-client's defense. 
"It was for a lead guest role on an episodic. They said that he . . . wasn't 
that strong an actor. I personally thought he was wonderful on 'Talk Soup' -- 
but that's a comedic thing. He wants to be a serious dramatic actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt has received two offers: "The first was a music video with Weird Al 
Yankovich. It was something he really wanted to do. But when I checked the 
dates, his manager said John was probably going to be in jail that day. Then he 
went off and did that porno thing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Spillane's shoulders slump; for a split second she concedes defeat. "Once he 
went the porno route, it limited what we can do. We don't get into X-rated 
projects. We only go so far." But then another idea hits her. "Didn't . . . 
Sylvester Stallone make a porno film when he was young?" 
</P>
<P>
 "So did Joan Crawford!" Webb roars in encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at the history of these things," Spillane is back in sell 
mode. "Charles Dutton was in jail (for manslaughter). Stacy Keach was in jail 
for drugs . . . and still got his series back. Tim Allen was in jail for drugs. 
So this is not such a terrible thing we're doing -- it's a chance for people to 
turn their lives around." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they say, compared to some of the nightmare stories about so-called 
"regular" clients (don't get them started on the subject of child actors), Joey 
Buttafuoco is "an angel." 
</P>
<P>
 "Joey booked his very first audition -- it's a small role in an independent," 
Spillane says. "He plays a cabbie in 'Cul-de-Sac.' His wrap party's tonight. 
They're also interested in him for an Off-Broadway show. And there was a 
producer interested in him for a film with Frank Gorshin. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously any Italian picture would be great for him," Webb is thinking out 
loud. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's also comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fun."  
</P>
<P>
 "I can see him doing some of the Belushi things. He could star in his own 
films. He's a talented man. Who knows how far we'll go?" Spillane says. "We're 
just getting started with Joey, just getting started."
