 NEW LAW: It was not the centerpiece of Jack O'Connell's legislative agenda. 
But the Ventura County assemblyman decided it was about time that the state of 
California free its horses to legally mate in public. . . . O'Connell's bill 
purging 42 obsolete laws was signed recently by Gov. Pete Wilson. Lawmakers 
chuckled while axing laws that demanded damages for "seduction," banned the 
selling of quicksilver and forbade dueling. "These laws belong in history," 
O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW WAR: So much for the cease-fire in Ventura's hospital war (B1). . . . A 
lawsuit announced Tuesday by Community Memorial Hospital is a costly new step 
in that private hospital's assault on the county's expanding hospital system. 
The suit was drafted by the Los Angeles office of an old-line New York law 
firm. "I'm sure they're going to bill in the $300-per-hour range," a top Los 
Angeles lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW WIFE: Talk about courtroom twists. Prosecutors were stunned Tuesday when a 
key witness in the case against a former Newbury Park football star declared 
that she had married the defendant three weeks ago in Las Vegas (B4). . . . "It 
took me 15 seconds to collect my wits," said Deputy Dist. Atty. James Grunert. 
. . . Leodes Van Buren is charged with shooting into a home occupied by the 
witness, Marcie James, and their 2-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW TITLE: Even as Oxnard boxing phenom Fernando Vargas won the national 
junior lightweight title over the weekend, he cast an envious glance at his 
contemporaries at the Goodwill Games in Russia (C8). . . . Fernando is the 
reigning U.S. amateur champ at 132 pounds regardless of age. But he could not 
compete in St. Petersburg because he is only 16. . . . "I'm sitting there 
watching and I'm thinking, 'Dang, if only I was 17." . . . However, in winning 
Sunday, the boxer did qualify for the world junior championships in Istanbul in 
September, where he will face a talented Cuban. "I'm pretty sure I'm ready," he 
said.

DODGERS LEFT TWISTING IN THE WIND, 12-5; BASEBALL: THE BULLPEN GIVES UP SEVEN 
RUNS TO THE GIANTS IN THE SEVENTH INNING AFTER HERSHISER RETURNS FROM INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers, suffering from wind-burn, are still in first place, but the sting 
felt after Tuesday's 12-5 loss to the San Francisco Giants is obviously not 
soothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger bullpen, called in to relieve Orel Hershiser after five innings, 
gave up seven runs in the seventh inning, turning a two-run deficit into an 
insurmountable one. The strong wind at Candlestick Park didn't help, but both 
teams played on the same field, as Raul Mondesi can attest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard because you don't know where the ball is going -- sometimes it goes 
in, sometimes it goes out," Mondesi said. "Their guy, (center fielder Darren 
Lewis), he's good." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, which came before 55,771, was the Dodgers' ninth in 12 games and cut 
their lead in the National League West to one game over Colorado and 1 1/2 
games over the Giants with one game remaining in the series. The Dodgers won 
the first game Monday night, 10-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you (the media) make more of (today's game) than we do, " said Brett 
Butler, who played for the Giants for three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will go home in first place, we got them (Monday) night, they got us 
(Tuesday), we have to go out and get them (tonight). Did anybody expect 
anything different than this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Only two balls went out of the park Tuesday, Matt Williams' major 
league-leading 38th, a two-run shot in the fifth inning that put the Giants 
ahead, 5-0, and a three-run homer by Mike Piazza in the seventh that made the 
score 5-3. But in the bottom of the seventh, after Rudy Seanez had pitched a 
perfect sixth inning, Jim Gott and Roger McDowell combined to give up seven 
runs on five hits, including a popup behind first base that fell between three 
fielders, loading the bases.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody called for it, because we didn't know where it was going," Mondesi 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the ball had been caught for the second out it would have changed the 
inning for Gott, whose earned-run average soared to 6.09. But entering the game 
with two out, McDowell couldn't stop the Giants either, giving up six runs. He 
gave up four hits, including a two-run single to pinch-hitter Dave Martinez and 
a two-run single to center by Jeff Reed. Pinch-hitter Mark Leonard hit a 
run-scoring triple to right field that went over Mondesi's head to the wall as 
he skidded on the warning track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurt," Mondesi said, looking at his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 What has hurt the Dodgers more is their pitching, with the bullpen soaring to 
a 6.46 ERA over the last 12 games, and the starters' ERA at 6.52 during that 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do better there -- there is no question about it," Fred Claire, 
Dodger executive vice president, said when asked about the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser (5-5) hadn't started a game since July 8. Before his last scheduled 
start, July 16, he suffered a strained muscle in his left side and had been 
sidelined since. He said he felt fine Tuesday, but gave up five runs, three 
earned, and six hits before departing after five innings.  
</P>
<P>
 Todd Benzinger, who had a .444 career average against Hershiser before the 
game, drove in the Giants' first run in the second inning, when he tripled to 
right field and drove in Darryl Strawberry, who had singled. 
</P>
<P>
 But why Manager Tom Lasorda didn't order Benzinger walked intentionally during 
the next inning was puzzling. The next batter, Royce Clayton, has a career 
batting average of .080 against Hershiser. With two out and runners on second 
and third -- with the help of an error by Tim Wallach, a wild pitch by 
Hershiser and Williams' first stolen base of the season -- first base was open. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Benzinger said Hershiser threw him five consecutive curveballs, but he took 
advantage of the fifth one, getting a two-run single into center field to put 
the Giants ahead, 3-0. Manager Dusty Baker called Lasorda's decision a turning 
point.  
</P>
<P>
 "Did it work for (Baker) last night when he walked Mondesi?" Lasorda snapped 
in response. "We just tried to pitch around him, but he (Hershiser) made a bad 
pitch and didn't get the ball where he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Giant starter William VanLandingham (6-1) and three relievers, the 
Dodgers stranded 10 runners, seven in scoring position. They scored twice in 
the ninth inning, and Piazza had four RBIs, giving him 85, but the deficit was 
too large. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't say, 'What if?' " Eric Karros said. "It's the way that things end 
up."

 Seattle lost its second cornerback for the season because of a serious knee 
injury.Kirby Jackson, who was supposed to be a backup, tore the anterior 
cruciate ligament in his right knee in a non-contact drill at the Kirkland, 
Wash., training camp last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, 29, was signed as an unrestricted free agent on June 9 after seven 
years in the NFL. He was on the Buffalo Bills' injured reserve list last season 
after a preseason right-knee injury 
</P>
<P>
 Another acquisition from Buffalo, Nate Odomes, hurt his knee in a pickup 
basketball game and is also lost for the season.

MORNING BRIEFING: PADRES ISSUED STORM WARNING BY NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Class A Lake Elsinore Storm didn't win Monday night's attendance battle 
with the National League's San Diego Padres, but now they would like to do 
battle on the baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we couldn't beat them at the gate," Storm General Manager Kevin 
Haughian said, "it might be fun to see how the players would size up on the 
field. We might not have won the attendance record, but we sure had fun 
trying." 
</P>
<P>
 The Storm, capitalizing on the Padres' poor attendance, had urged baseball 
fans to help the team outdraw the Padres. It wasn't to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Storm, an Angel farm team, drew 6,108 to the 7,566-seat Lake Elsinore 
diamond to watch the team beat the Stockton Ports, 3-2, and move into a tie for 
first place in the California League's Southern Division. About 60 miles south, 
at 46,510-seat Jack Murphy Stadium, 9,195 watched the Padres lose, 4-3, to the 
Colorado Rockies.

 A novel idea: Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has a recommendation 
for major league baseball -- a profit cap. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "It would go something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Pick a fair figure, say, $5 million or $10 million. Once profits go above 
that amount, the cap goes into effect. Immediately, ticket prices are cut in 
half, concessions are cut by two-thirds. If there are profits above the cap at 
the end of the season, the money goes to charity."

ANGELS, LOSERS AGAIN, LOOKING TO CLOSE A BIG DEAL SOON; BASEBALL: A'S WIN, 6-0. 
CALIFORNIA GOING AFTER AGUILERA, WETTELAND, MYERS OR MONTGOMERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, realizing now they were only fooling themselves in believing they 
could contend without a closer -- even in the American League West -- are 
trying to acquire a proven veteran before Sunday's trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, according to highly placed sources, are focusing their attention 
on Rick Aguilera of the Minnesota Twins, John Wetteland of Montreal, Randy 
Myers of the Chicago Cubs and Jeff Montgomery of Kansas City. They are all 
available, and each have contracts through at least the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who lost Tuesday to the Oakland Athletics, 6-0, for their fifth 
consecutive defeat, in front of 20,156 fans at Anaheim Stadium, recognize that 
time is of the essence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels not only are fading out of the American League West race, but need 
something to rejuvenate their spirits. The Angels, 42-59, dropped to 
season-high 17 games below .500, and are 6 1/2 games behind the 
division-leading Texas Rangers, equaling their season's biggest deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, they gave up hope that right fielder Tim Salmon's hamstring 
would improve by this week and placed him on the disabled list, retroactive to 
July 18. They recalled Garret Anderson, who was batting .346 with 10 homers and 
82 runs batted in at triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels certainly could use more than Anderson and a closer to get back in 
the race, but if they don't find a closer before the 1995 season, they're 
convinced they'll be in the same predicament next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' hope is that most of the teams in the market for a closer get 
scared away because of the tentative Aug. 16 strike date, enabling them to 
acquire one before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you're going to win, you have to have a closer," said Angel 
Manager Marcel Lachemann, who demoted Joe Grahe and will employ a 
bullpen-by-committee. "If you look at most of the teams who win, they have 
closers. If they don't, you'll hear and read that they're looking for one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very, very important part of a ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at Oakland. Tony (La Russa) is the master of the bullpen, but if he 
doesn't have (Dennis) Eckersley in the back of it, it doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 This night, however, it wouldn't have mattered if the Angels had Eckersley in 
their bullpen. The Angels were out of this game by the second inning, and the 
only lingering suspense was whether they would reach second base before the 
game's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 La Russa ruined that challenge when he removed starter Steve Ontiveros after 
seven innings. Ontiveros (6-3), who was out of baseball in 1992, had restricted 
the Angels to only two singles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels were able to avoid the dubious embarrassment when second baseman 
Harold Reynolds -- who was being showcased for a possible trade to Oakland -- 
stretched a two-out single into a double off reliever Bob Welch in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that was the highlight of the Angel offense, which was limited to three 
hits, suffering their first shutout since the last time they played these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, the Angels have now been shut out three consecutive games against 
Oakland, failing to score in the last 31 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Angel starter Chuck Finley (7-10) had one rotten inning, and it 
didn't take long for him to realize it would haunt him. The Athletics, leading 
1-0, scored five runs in the second inning, including a two-run double by 
former Angel Stan Javier, putting the game out of reach. Javier wound up with a 
career-high three doubles, tying the franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley yielded only one hit after the second inning through his eight-inning 
stint, but it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Oakland and Texas coming up," Finley said, "we thought this was a chance 
where we could get something going. I kind of threw that plan out the window 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Angels can only watch to see if the Athletics (45-54), the hottest 
team in baseball since June 16, can pull off one of the most dramatic comebacks 
in history. Remember, these guys were 16-40 on June 6.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ASTROS' BAGWELL SURPASSES 100-RBI MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell hit his 33rd home run to become the first major leaguer with 100 
runs batted in, and the Astros rallied after blowing a five-run lead to beat 
the Reds, 6-5, at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Gonzalez doubled home the go-ahead run in the seventh inning to move the 
Astros to within a game of Cincinnati in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston built a 5-0 lead off Jose Rijo behind Bagwell's two-run homer, which 
gave him 101 RBIs in 101 games. It didn't occur to him at the time that he had 
become the first to hit triple digits -- not Frank Thomas, not Ken Griffey Jr., 
not Matt Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm as surprised as much as anybody else that I've got 101 already," 
Bagwell said. "It helped tonight, which is all I wanted. That was the big 
thing. It helped win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds rallied against Pete Harnisch in the sixth when Deion Sanders leveled 
Scott Servais at the plate to score the tying fifth run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him coming around third," Servais said. "He's playing hard, I'm playing 
hard. I'm not going to give any ground. Now I know what guys in the NFL feel 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had collisions before like that, but nothing that intense," Sanders 
said. "It was a big play, but we still lost. I'm so disappointed we didn't win. 
It would have been so much better if we'd have won." 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 5, Atlanta 3 -- The Expos took advantage of four unearned runs to 
gain their eighth consecutive victory by defeating Greg Maddux and the Braves 
at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos opened a 3 1/2-game lead over the Braves in the East Division, 
turning errors by Maddux and shortstop Jeff Blauser into a three-run seventh 
inning for a 5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Henry (8-2) gave up only three hits and two runs in seven innings. Both 
runs came on a homer by Charlie O'Brien in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than that one pitch, he was almost perfect," said Montreal Manager 
Felipe Alou. "Maddux had his good control and stuff, but they made a couple of 
errors -- some mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves held a players-only meeting before the game, but still lost for the 
seventh time in 10 games. They've lost two consecutive games to Montreal and 
seven of 10 to the Expos this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux (13-6) lowered his earned-run average to 1.68, best in the majors, 
despite the loss. He had retired 13 consecutive batters until the seventh, when 
leadoff hitter Wil Cordero reached on Blauser's error. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 6, San Diego 5 -- Mark Thompson won his major league debut and the 
Rockies moved within one game of the first-place Dodgers by defeating the 
Padres at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, Colorado's second pick in the 1992 draft, became the first player 
taken in an amateur draft by the Rockies to appear in a big-league game. He 
gave up three runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings, walking four and striking 
out two. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Reed got the last out, striking out Derek Bell with a runner on third, 
for his second save. Scott Sanders (3-8) lost his fourth consecutive decision. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 10, St. Louis 9 -- Rico Brogna drove in four runs, two on a 
game-winning home run in the 11th inning at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Brogna, who tied a club record with five hits Monday night, has hit safely in 
his last 12 starts and is batting .488 (21 for 43) in those games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Maddux (2-1) pitched a scoreless 10th to pick up the victory and John 
Franco earned his 24th save. Franco was the eighth New York pitcher, tying a 
club record. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 10, Florida 8 -- Ricky Jordan hit a tie-breaking single in the 
12th inning as the Phillies blew a six-run lead but rallied to win at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Eisenreich led off the 12th with a single and took second when right 
fielder Gary Sheffield overran the ball for an error. Jordan then singled off 
Robb Nen (4-5) and scored on an infield single by Kim Batiste, who had four 
hits and three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 8, Pittsburgh 4 -- Mark Grace and Rick Wilkins hit eighth-inning home 
runs and the Cubs overcame Anthony Young's injury-shortened start at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, activated off the disabled list before the game, lasted four innings 
before leaving with fatigue in his right elbow and forearm. Young had been on 
the disabled list since July 10 because of a strained elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's bullpen survived Tom Foley's solo homer in the sixth and Dave 
Clark's two-run homer in the seventh to finish up for Young, who is 1-0 with a 
1.00 ERA in three starts against Pittsburgh this season.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MARTINEZ AND BELLE LEAD INDIANS TO SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Martinez allowed just two hits in eight innings and Albert Belle had 
three hits, including his 32nd home run, as the Cleveland Indians defeated the 
Orioles, 9-2, Tuesday night to gain a split in the first day-night doubleheader 
at Baltimore since 1961.  
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, Harold Baines ended a long homer-less drought with two solo 
shots in the Orioles' 10-4 victory. Rafael Palmeiro and Leo Gomez also homered 
for Baltimore, which withstood homers from Belle and Eddie Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was a carbon-copy of the first game," Cleveland Manager Mike 
Hargrove said about the nightcap. "This time, we scored all the runs and they 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Belle, who is playing while appealing a 10-game suspension for using a corked 
bat, has six home runs in his last eight games. He had three runs batted in 
Tuesday, giving him 93 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland took command of the second game in the first inning, using a run 
scoring double by Belle and a three-run double by Manny Ramirez to go up 4-0. 
Belle hit a solo homer against Mike Oquist (3-3) in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "The home run to Belle was right down the middle," Oquist said. "They don't 
miss mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 That was more than enough offense for Martinez (10-5), who had a no-hitter 
until Brady Anderson's two-out, RBI single in the sixth. Martinez, 9-1 since 
May 11, walked two and struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
 After not hitting a home run in 69 at-bats since June 27, Baines homered in 
the fourth inning, and again in the sixth in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both were line drives," Baines said. "It really wasn't that I was trying to 
hit home runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben McDonald (12-6) faced just one batter over the minimum through six 
innings. He allowed seven hits in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 7, Toronto 5 -- Jody Reed -- who had been in a one-for-25 slump -- 
celebrated his 32nd birthday by hitting two singles, scoring a run and driving 
in two more in the Brewers' seven-run first inning at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was struggling for so long, trying everything," Reed said. "I go out there 
and relax and 'bam', two hits in one inning. It doesn't pay to get wound up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Bones (10-7) went eight innings to win his third consecutive start and 
help the Brewers end their three-game losing skid and snap the Blue Jays' 
season-high eight-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Guzman (10-10), who has a 30.90 earned run average against the Brewers 
this season, took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 3, Chicago 2 -- Wally Joyner had two run-scoring singles at Kansas 
City, as the Royals stretched their winning streak to four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gordon (10-6) improved to 7-1 lifetime against the White Sox, helped by 
relievers Billy Brewer, Rusty Meacham and Jeff Montgomery. Gordon allowed two 
runs and six hits in 7 1/3 innings. He walked five and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
 "After two bad starts, I was able to relax and throw strikes when I had to," 
said Gordon, who had given up 15 runs over nine innings in his previous two 
starts. "All my pitches were working and you have to have all of them against a 
good-hitting team like the White Sox." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Alvarez (11-6) gave up six hits and three runs in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 9, Seattle 1 -- Travis Fryman broke a hitless streak of 26 at bats 
with two doubles, two triples and four RBI at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The win was the 2,125th of Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson's career, leaving 
him one behind Joe McCarthy for fourth place on the career-wins list. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wells (4-6) allowed just one run on five hits in his fourth complete 
game of the season. Jim Converse (0-3) continued to struggle for Seattle, 
allowing six runs on nine hits in 5 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 10, New York 7 -- Tim Naehring and Mo Vaughn hit two-run home runs in 
the sixth inning to lift the Red Sox over the Yankees and Jimmy Key at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Naehring's seventh homer of the year came off Key (15-3) and capped a Red Sox 
comeback that began after the Yankees scored five runs in the first inning off 
Boston's Chris Nabholz (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Xavier Hernandez walked John Valentin and Vaughn then hit his 22nd 
homer to give the Red Sox an 8-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 8, Minnesota 7 -- Rusty Greer's run-scoring single with two outs in the 
eighth inning led the Rangers at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Strange's run-scoring pinch single in the bottom of the eighth against 
Rick Aguilera (1-4) tied the score, 7-7. Both Ranger runs were unearned. Manuel 
Lee reached second when his line drive hit off the glove of left fielder Shane 
Mack for an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee scored on Strange's hit off the glove of first baseman Kent Hrbek. One out 
later, Greer delivered his game-winner.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; BONDS JOINS FATHER IN 250/300 CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Bonds stole the 300th base of his career in the first inning and 
promptly picked up the second-base bag. He handed it to his father, Bobby 
Bonds, who gave it to a batboy to take into the clubhouse. But the Giants 
couldn't get another base right away, so it was put back until after the 
inning, when it was exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds became the sixth player in major league history to hit 250 home runs and 
steal 300 bases. The others are Willie Mays (660 home runs, 338 stolen bases); 
Bobby Bonds (332 home runs, 461 stolen bases); Joe Morgan (268 home runs, 689 
stolen base); Andre Dawson (427 home runs, 314 stolen bases) and Vada Pinson 
(256 home runs, 305 stolen bases). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tom Candiotti can't remember if he has pitched in every city on a trip before, 
but when he starts today against the San Francisco Giants, it will be his 
fourth city of this 13-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team has needed me to give them some innings, and I'm glad to be able to 
take the ball," said Candiotti, who started in Philadelphia and Montreal and 
pitched seven innings of relief in New York. "Even as a knuckleballer, you 
still get sore and you still have to lift weights and get ready to pitch, but I 
enjoy it. I told Perry (pitching coach Ron Perranoski) all along to start me. 
One time two years ago when we had all those doubleheaders, I wanted to start 
both games. I would fit in well with a rotation of four guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti, who will start on three days' rest, pitched on two days' rest when 
he was called in to relieve Ismael Valdes in the second inning, then came back 
four days later and started another game. He has a 1-1 record and has given up 
four earned runs in 20 innings for a 1.80 earned-run average on the trip.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: TUNA FINALLY GET HUNGRY, PROVIDE FEAST FOR ANGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week ago, business was so bad in San Diego that Phil Lobred, manager of H&M 
Landing, made the comment: "We're dying on the vine down here." 
</P>
<P>
 And it wasn't a case of sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been dead down here," agreed Dan Sansome, owner of nearby Pt. Loma 
Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was a week ago. The phones are ringing steadily now as the tuna that 
have been so finicky have turned voracious. And at least some of the fish are 
making their way north, which means they might be within range of San Diego's 
huge overnight fleet any day. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, those aboard the multiday boats are working huge bluefin and 
bouncing to smaller yellowfin tuna and dorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Sansome's American Angler returned from a four-day trip Sunday with 297 
yellowfin averaging about 15 pounds. The 19 passengers were able to land 48 
bluefin ranging from 70 to 113 pounds, but they lost hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were using 60- to 100-pound test line and it was just full on for seven 
hours," Sansome said. "It was rough, and that didn't help matters. I would say 
they probably lost six or seven fish for every one caught." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same aboard the Vagabond, which brought back 58 bluefin, 22 of 
which weighed more than 100 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sansome said the biggest concentration of tuna is still between 200 and 250 
miles southwest of Pt. Loma, but skippers have metered fish as close as 100 
miles away. Another 20 or miles north and they will be ripe for the taking by 
the overnight fleet. Providing they want to eat, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Mike Schulz stepped off the Mustang on Saturday, his left arm was hanging 
limp by his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "My left bicep feels like somebody has beaten on it with a hammer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schulz wasn't complaining. He and 24 others spent the better part of the 
day battling big yellowtail off the backside of San Clemente Island. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, they had put 111 fish on deck, making it the most successful 
yellowtail trip this year out of 22nd Street Landing in San Pedro. Schulz 
landed seven, all weighing more than 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest was a 38-pounder by Ken Mook of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable, dude," Schulz said. "We ran out of bait halfway through 
the trip. Otherwise we could have caught them all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 But could they have pulled them in? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, little Lake Barrett is in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass fishermen by the thousands have expressed interest in fishing the San 
Diego City-run reservoir, and for good reason. The lake has been closed to 
angling since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 It will open again Saturday, and fishing is expected to be outstanding. But 
there are plenty of snags to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake will be open only on weekends, and only 20 boats -- none with motors 
-- will be allowed on the lake at a time. Fishing will be limited to 
catch-and-release.  
</P>
<P>
 A lottery system will be used to pick prospective anglers, who can participate 
by mailing a self-addressed card to San Diego City Lakes, Barrett Lottery, 5540 
Kiowa Dr., La Mesa, CA. 91942. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't hold your breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've basically received a couple of thousand cards already," said Jim Brown, 
manager of the lakes. "And we've already drawn through the last Sunday in 
August." 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 BAJA FISHING -- Robert Montford last Saturday caught a 484-pound blue marlin 
aboard the Gaviota II to highlight the past week off Cabo San Lucas. Montford, 
48, of Tustin, said hooking the big blue "was like hooking into a train." Two 
fishermen from Bakersfield were fishing aboard a boat called Blue Marlin, but 
caught a 418-pound black marlin, one of only a handful caught this year. An 
even more unusual catch was a white marlin, again aboard the Gaviota II. Huge 
tuna -- one reported at 210 pounds -- and dorado are also being caught. Fishing 
at the East Cape has been equally good, with tuna to 80 pounds and dorado 
providing plenty of action. Blue marlin and sailfish are fairly plentiful as 
well. There were unconfirmed reports of a 690-pound blue, but most have been in 
the 200- to 300-pound range. Roosterfish are abundant along the beaches, but 
getting them to bite has been difficult. Farther up the gulf, at Loreto, dorado 
fishing remains outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 POACHING -- It's becoming a problem at Puddingstone Reservoir. DFG warden Mark 
Jeter patrolled the lake's shores three times this month -- and has captured 
poachers each time. Most are throwing nets at night and escaping with hundreds 
of bluegill, catfish, crappie and bass. The latest to be caught illegally using 
a throw-net in the lake: Jose L. Bonilla, 36, and Florentino Lopez, 31, both of 
Pomona. Bonilla was cited and released. Lopez was detained because of 
outstanding warrants. They were arrested on July 16 at 1 a.m. Using illegal 
gear is a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of $1,000 and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- Deer hunters in Zone A figure to have little company for this 
summer's hunt. A total of 48,000 tags remain for the coastal zone, which 
includes much of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The season opens on Aug. 
13. An abundance of tags also remain for various hunts beginning later this 
summer or fall. 
</P>
<P>
 CALENDAR -- Crowley Lake is one of the most popular trout fisheries in the 
state, but Sacramento perch will be in the spotlight next week. Crowley Lake 
Fish Camp's second annual perch derby will run Monday through Friday, with 
$10,000 going to anyone who can break the current record of 3 pounds 10 ounces. 
Many fish topping two pounds have been landed in recent days. Cost is $5 and 
registration is available at the lake any time before Monday. . . . The Mako 
del Rey shark fishing tournament -- sanctioned by International Gamefish 
Tournaments, with a first prize of up to $5,000 -- will be held out of Marina 
Del Rey Aug. 13-14. Details: (714) 573-1415.

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; AZINGER HAS NEW OUTLOOK ON HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those pro athletes who feel invincible, who think it will never end, should 
listen to Paul Azinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all think we're in control of our lives, but we're not," Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months after learning he had a cancerous tumor, it might be that 
Azinger, 34, now has a better understanding of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 He has completed radiation treatments and an outpatient surgical procedure to 
remove a fatty tumor in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm encouraged, I'm cured," he said. "I'm thankful when I wake up and can see 
the ceiling. A lot of people take sight for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger is planning to resume his career in the PGA Championship Aug. 11-14 at 
Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably wouldn't have targeted the PGA for my return if I wasn't the 
defending champ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been speculation that Azinger might start his comeback last week in 
the New England Classic, which he also won last year, but the surgery set him 
back three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger did stop by Pleasant Valley Country Club in Sutton, Mass., to say 
hello. For the rest of his life, he said, he will know how fortunate he has 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm eternally grateful to those who went before me," Azinger said. "Lymphoma 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've realized how easy it is to lift someone's spirits by just writing or 
saying something. I've got a new calling -- I need to be an inspiration to 
people. I have a chance to reach out." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his golf game, Azinger has been spending a lot of time with clubs in 
his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't chip good, it's not because of lack of practice," he said. "My 
swing isn't pretty, but it repeats." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger said he hit his first three-irons, three-woods and drivers last week. 
He said he didn't hit them very well, but hit them hard and felt no discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no pain in my shoulder whatsoever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he thinks he will perform on the course, Azinger said he has learned 
a lot about expectations. "I feel like I'll be as competitive as ever," he 
said. "I know initially it will be tough to concentrate with all the 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but for inspiration, all Azinger has to do is look at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High Price: How confident was Nick Price in his putting at the British Open? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently a lot more than he was in June at the U.S. Open, where he put five 
putters in his bag. At Turnberry, Price had only one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More Price: For what it's worth, Price finished 35th in the Masters and missed 
the cut in the U.S. Open, the two previous major events this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's mental, right? What percentage of golf is physical and what percentage is 
mental? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the million-dollar question, isn't it?" said Patrick J. Cohn, a sports 
psychologist in Naples, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ask any player, if you've got a good swing, it's 80% mental," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn is part of an expanding breed of golf helpers in the clinical field, even 
if his clinic is the golf course. He works with PGA Tour players Trevor Dodds, 
Grant Waite and Kelly Gibson and consults with golfers on the LPGA, Nike and 
Asian tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn, who earned a doctorate in sports psychology at the University of 
Virginia and taught the subject at Miami of Ohio and North Texas, is the author 
of two books, "The Mental Game of Golf" and "Mind Power Putting." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to staying on top of your golf game is to maintain your confidence, 
Cohn said, adding: "Players need to learn to accept mistakes and be a little 
more kind to themselves." 
</P>
<P>

 Michael Schumacher's dominance of the Formula One season was sidetracked 
Tuesday, and the two-week suspension he received for breaking the circuit's 
rules could cost him the points title. 
</P>
<P>
 International Automobile Federation (FIA) officials barred the German driver 
from the next two Grand Prix races, giving Damon Hill a chance to win the title 
Schumacher appeared to have locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher, who has won six of eight races this season with seconds in the 
other two, had no comment, but was on the verge of tears when he left FIA 
headquarters.

 Schumacher was penalized for passing Hill on a warm-up lap and temporarily 
ignoring a black flag during the British Grand Prix. Boxing

 Nevada boxing authorities believe the death of former Olympic champion Wangila 
Napunyi of Kenya was unavoidable.

 "We watched the film from the fight and there were no clues at all," said Marc 
Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission. "Everything 
was very normal. Napunyi gave as good as he got until the ninth round and even 
landed a lot of good punches in the eighth." 
</P>
<P>
 Napunyi, 26, was fighting David Gonzales of Houston in a scheduled 10-round 
welterweight bout Friday night. Referee Joe Cortez stopped the contest in the

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; HANDFUL OF REFUGEES FLEEING CZAR AND STALIN LIVE ON 
FAITH; LOST IN THE TAIGA ONE RUSSIAN FAMILY'S FIFTY-YEAR STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL 
AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE SIBERIAN WILDERNESS, BY VASILY PESKOV , TRANSLATED

<P>
 "Lost in the Taiga" is one of the most remarkable stories to emerge from the 
smoke and rubble of the former Soviet Union, a shining saga of survival in the 
Siberian wilderness that also serves as a kind of parable about the function of 
faith and tradition in the history and destiny of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The story begins in 1978, when a party of Soviet geologists was surveying a 
remote stretch of wilderness by helicopter in search of iron ore deposits. To 
their astonishment, they observed a rough-hewn cabin and a cultivated garden in 
an otherwise pristine and wholly inaccessible portion of the vast coniferous 
forest known as the "taiga." 
</P>
<P>
 What the geologists had discovered -- and what Soviet journalist Vasily Peskov 
went on to investigate in intimate detail -- was the refuge of a family of "Old 
Believers" who fled from the worst excesses of Stalinism in the 1930s and who 
managed to preserve themselves for nearly a half-century on the strength of 
their survival skills and their abundant faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their existence, squalid in the extreme," observes Peskov, "consisted of 
prayers, reading prayer books, and a genuine struggle for existence in nearly 
primeval conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 When a party of curious but cautious geologists, bearing both gifts and arms, 
finally reached the mysterious encampment, they found a scene "like something 
halfway between Peter the Great and the Stone Age." The Lykov family dressed in 
rough burlap, they lived on pine nuts and potatoes, they drank out of 
birch-bark vessels -- and suddenly they were face to face with the 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greetings, grandfather!" one geologist hailed the long-bearded patriarch of 
the family, Karp Lykov. "We've come to visit." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for our sins, our sins!" cried one of the women who huddled in fear 
in a dark corner of the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the family belonged to a sect that had broken away from the 
Russian Orthodox Church in the days of Peter the Great. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the long-dead czar and his churchmen "were for Karp Osipovich 
implacable, intimate, and personal foes." And it was the religious fervor of 
the Lykov family that sustained them over the long years of self-imposed exile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often conversation was broken off by their impulse to go pray that very 
second," recalls Peskov. "The prayer stopped as abruptly as it had begun, and 
the conversation took up where it left off." 
</P>
<P>
 Peskov visited (and wrote about) the Lykovs over more than a decade, and he 
watched as the family slowly acquainted itself with the history and technology 
of the world they had shunned. 
</P>
<P>
 They rejoiced at gifts of a piece of canvas, a kitten, a spinning wheel, but 
they refused a box of matches: "Sinful fire," says Karp Lykov, who refused to 
give up the flint and tinder that he used to strike a flame. "Our trick is 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Peskov, the Lykovs came to welcome the intrusion of the outside 
world, and he refuses to depict their experience as a casting out from Eden. 
"We were starting to wear out," says Agafia, Karp Lykov's daughter. "We were 
eating without salt." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a faint trace of Adam and Eve in his tale, and Peskov observes 
that "an avid curiosity awoke in (the family), a desire to learn and 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the Lykov family is so remarkable, so moving and so well-told 
that I wondered at first if they were not a kind of Siberian version of the 
Tasaday tribe of the Philippine rain forest: Was "Lost in the Taiga" a good 
yarn made even better by some colorful embellishments? 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we have no reason to believe that Peskov is not telling us exactly what 
he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the last survivor of the Lykov family is Agafia, a 50-year-old woman 
who lives utterly alone in the taiga and refuses to seek the company of other 
human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shall live as we have always lived," vows Agafia, and her words resonate 
with larger meanings as we contemplate not only her own curious fate but the 
destiny of Russia itself.

from last year's $114,600. Total festival attendance was 21,800, up almost 
1,000 from last year. Not surprisingly, the giddy "The Adventures of Priscilla, 
Queen of the Desert" was voted by the audience as the favorite feature of the 
festival; it opens at selected theaters Aug. 10. "Coming Out Under Fire," in 
which gays and lesbians tell of their experiences in World War II, was chosen 
as best documentary. The top short film was "Death in Venice, CA" and the top

enormously popular at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The show has drawn 
more than 200,000 visitors during the first six weeks of its Met run. If 
attendance continues at the same pace until its Sept. 4 closing, "Picasso" will 
be the museum's most heavily attended summer exhibition since 1978. The show

THEATER REVIEW; 'PARKING' HEATS UP L.A. PROJECT ONE-ACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One-act play festivals have been flooding Los Angeles in recent months. Now, 
the Ensemble Studio Theatre's L.A. Project dives into the spate with "Summer 
Shorts," a collection of five one-acts at the Fountain Theatre. The offerings 
range from genuinely amusing to mere drops in the bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 James Morrison's "Parking," one of the shorter plays, is also the best, a 
warp-force and furious comedy that taps into the most universal and powerful 
emotion of the technological age -- urban traffic Angst .  
</P>
<P>
 Ray (Barry Kramer) is not characteristically this splenetic; it's just that he 
has been blocked into a parking place for 35 minutes on the busiest shopping 
day of the year by Gene (James Dumont), a blithe Yuppie who thinks the world 
revolves according to his Filofax.  
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, Morrison's premise is deceptively slight, but Ray's passionate 
diatribe is nothing less than a thinking man's outcry against the decline and 
fall of Western civilization. Director Anne O'Sullivan and her fine cast make 
this point -- hilariously.  
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, Garry Williams' "A Blooming of Ivy" is also slight. Dig deeper 
down, and you'll find it is still slight -- but that isn't bad. Williams' 
engaging romance about the wooing of a longtime widow by her newly widowed 
farmer neighbor is distinguished by its Shaker-like simplicity. Kate Baggott 
directs efficiently and affectionately, eliciting charming performances from 
Barbara Tarbuck and Charles Parks, old-shoe actors who are so worn in and 
comfortable that you hardly realize they're "on." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Merson's "Star Train" also features the coming together of two lonely 
people, a widowed mother of three (Ann Talman) and an aging, flamboyant 
songwriter (Jake Dengel), who meet on the back platform of a cross-country 
train, circa 1955. Merson goes out on a sentimental limb and lands in schmaltz 
in her sweet but stilted drama, which has been somewhat haltingly directed by 
Art Wolff.  
</P>
<P>
 Another failed effort is Keno Rider's "New York," about an HIV-positive artist 
fed up with the brutality of city life. The play ends with an extreme gesture 
of love and self-sacrifice by the man's lover that is intended to both shock 
and move us. This is risky stuff- but the risk doesn't pay off. Unfortunately, 
since Rider has not sufficiently developed the dynamic between his characters, 
the ending seems merely manipulative.  
</P>
<P>
 The entire second act is occupied by Carole Real's "Why the Beach Boys Are 
Like Opera," an intermittently funny piece buoyed by a likable cast. If you 
liked the film "Where the Boys Are," you'll probably go for this light-spirited 
comedy, in which a trio of three longtime gal pals kvetch over the appalling 
state of modern romance while searching for their dream man. Although Real's 
take on women may seem reductionist to some, the play is pleasurably escapist 
fluff in which happy endings are enjoyed by all, including the audience. 
</P>

ANGELS LOSE AGAIN, LOOK TO CLOSE DEAL; BASEBALL: A'S WIN 6-0. CALIFORNIA GOING 
AFTER AGUILERA, WETTELAND, MYERS OR MONTGOMERY.

<P>
 The Angels, realizing now they were only fooling themselves in believing they 
could contend without a closer -- even in the American League West -- are 
trying to acquire a proven veteran before Sunday's trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, according to highly placed sources, are focusing their attention 
on Rick Aguilera of the Minnesota Twins, John Wetteland of Montreal, Randy 
Myers of the Chicago Cubs and Jeff Montgomery of Kansas City. They are all 
available, and each have contracts through at least the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who lost Tuesday night to the Oakland Athletics, 6-0, their fifth 
consecutive defeat, in front of 20,156 fans at Anaheim Stadium, recognize that 
time is of the essence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels not only are fading out of the American League West race, but need 
something to rejuvenate their spirits. The Angels, 42-59, dropped to 
season-high 17 games below .500, and are 6 1/2 games behind the 
division-leading Texas Rangers, equaling their season's biggest deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, they gave up hope that right fielder Tim Salmon's hamstring 
would improve by this week and placed him on the disabled list, retroactive to 
July 18. They recalled Garret Anderson, who was batting .346 with 10 homers and 
82 runs batted in at triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels certainly could use more than Anderson and a closer to get back in 
the race, but if they don't find a closer before the 1995 season, they're 
convinced they'll be in the same predicament next year. The Angels' hope is 
that most of the teams in the market for a closer get scared away because of 
the tentative Aug. 16 strike date, enabling them to acquire one before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you're going to win, you have to have a closer," said Angel 
Manager Marcel Lachemann, who demoted Joe Grahe and will employ a 
bullpen-by-committee. "If you look at most of the teams who win, they have 
closers. If they don't, you'll hear and read that they're looking for one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very, very important part of a ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at Oakland. Tony (La Russa) is the master of the bullpen, but if he 
doesn't have (Dennis) Eckersley in the back of it, it doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 This night, however, it wouldn't have mattered if the Angels had Eckersley in 
their bullpen. The Angels were out of this game by the second inning, and the 
only lingering suspense was whether they would reach second base before the 
game's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 La Russa ruined that challenge when he removed starter Steve Ontiveros after 
seven innings. Ontiveros (6-3), who was out of baseball in 1992, had restricted 
the Angels to only two singles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels were able to avoid the dubious embarrassment when second baseman 
Harold Reynolds -- who was being showcased for a possible trade to Oakland -- 
stretched a two-out single into a double off reliever Bob Welch in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that was the highlight of the Angel offense, which was limited to three 
hits, suffering their first shutout since the last time they played these guys. 
Incredibly, the Angels have now been shut out three consecutive games against 
Oakland, failing to score in the last 31 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm personally embarrassed that guy (Ontiveros) got me out three times," 
designated hitter Chili Davis said. "He's a trickster. The guy we're facing 
(today) is a trickster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely going out there in a trickster frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Angel starter Chuck Finley (7-10) had one rotten inning, and it 
didn't take long for him to realize it would haunt him. The Athletics, leading 
1-0, scored five runs in the second inning, including a two-run double by 
former Angel Stan Javier, putting the game out of reach. Javier wound up with a 
career-high three doubles, tying the franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley yielded only one hit after the second inning though his eight-inning 
stint, but it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he could only watch the Athletics (45-54) vault past the Angels and 
put themselves in serious contention for their fifth division title in the last 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Oakland and Texas coming up," Finley said, "we thought this was a chance 
where we could get something going. I kind of threw that plan out the window 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Angels can only watch to see if the Athletics, the hottest team in 
baseball since June 16, can pull off one of the most dramatic comebacks in 
history. Remember, these guys were 16-40 on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put it this way," La Russa said, "I think to be legit -- to say you've had a 
winning season -- you have to break 90 wins. But look at Kansas City in '84 and 
Minnesota in '87. I don't think those teams said, 'Boy, we had a great year.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like us, I don't think anybody around here is saying, 'We're having a 
great year.' But you persevere, you perform better than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 "It just cost you some strutting points. You can't walk around like you kicked 
everyone's butts."

OP PRO SURFING CHAMPIONSHIPS; THIS COULD BE THE LAST TIME ROBB HAS TO WORK HIS 
MAGIC IN DARKNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an all-too-familiar scenario for Kalani Robb. A little surf, solitude 
and . . . darkness? 
</P>
<P>
 Robb, the world amateur surfing champion from Sunset Beach, Hawaii, got off to 
a quiet start at the Op Pro championships Tuesday, winning his first-round heat 
in the junior competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad hardly anyone saw it. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing the first heat of the contest, Robb emerged from the competition area 
on the south side of the Huntington Beach Pier at 6:20 a.m. to find a couple 
dozen people on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was still dark out there," said Robb, who edged Scott Finn, 17.76 to 
17.73, to win the heat. "But the crowds really pick up later in the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Robb, 17, learned first-hand last year when he finished second in the Op 
Junior. He surfed on the final day in front of more than 15,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was great," he said. "We went off right before the men's finals, and 
there were people everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 But was Tuesday's solemn setting a disappointment for Robb, whose ocean 
creativity has earned him a pro contract and the attention of a Hollywood 
agent? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little nerve-wracking for me last year, with the big crowds," he 
said. "I'm used to surfing back on the North Shore, when I'm sitting out at 
Pipeline or Rocky Point on a stormy day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great, just me and a friend riding waves. Nobody would dare come out to 
watch in that weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the top amateur surfers have used the Op Junior as a springboard to 
the pro circuit, including world-tour stars Kelly Slater (1989 junior champion) 
and Rob Machado (1991 junior champion). 
</P>
<P>
 So Robb can hide in the cloak of obscurity for only so long. He has caught the 
eye of surfing's top pros since he first started hanging out on the North Shore 
breaks as a 9 year old. 
</P>
<P>
 He befriended Machado eight years ago, when Machado was an amateur, and the 
two have surfed together at every opportunity. And when Machado's not around, 
Robb is riding Pipeline with Sunny Garcia, a former Hawaiian triple-crown 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Machado really got me interested in surfing," Robb said. "I saw what he was 
doing out there (in the water) and I said, 'I want to do that, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Robb polished his moves on the North Shore, rolling through barrels at 
Pipeline and making aerial moves in smaller waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, he developed a knack for creativity in small surf, just like 
Machado. He's small and thin, just like Machado. 
</P>
<P>
 Those characteristics make for a versatile surfer who can compete in almost 
any conditions. And the Assn. of Surfing Professionals' world tour certainly 
tests a surfer's versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kalani is just doing things that the other guys aren't doing out there," said 
Les Walker, a photographer from Newport Beach who shoots most of the top pros. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes what Machado does and takes it to another level. He puts his 
signature on it. I don't know where Kalani gets so much speed and agility on 
such a small wave." 
</P>
<P>
 That ability has helped Robb win two national amateur titles before taking the 
world amateurs last May in Brazil, a prize only a few surfers have won on their 
way to the pro ranks. Former world pro champion Slater didn't do it. Neither 
did Machado, the defending U.S. pro champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb's success in Brazil, coupled with his results in Bud Pro Tour events the 
last two years, have convinced the surfing industry that he's a potential pro 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Surfboards has signed Robb to a three-year contract, which will pay him 
a salary when he turns pro next year. Hollywood agent Bryan Taylor, who has 
helped Slater land lucrative endorsement deals, is signing Robb as a client. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty has already put Robb in a surf video, which will premiere Aug. 5. When 
asked about the footage of him surfing Rocky Point and Pipeline, Robb grins and 
says: "It's insane." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's some pretty up-to-date stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Kingsbury, Op Pro media relations director, found some other adjectives 
to describe Robb's surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's hot," Kingsbury said. "I was watching it, and some of the stuff Kalani 
was doing is Slater-caliber. At first, I thought it was Slater." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Robb is doing just fine as an amateur, no comparisons please. He's 
surfing the Bud Pro Tour but is accepting no prize money. He's already ranked 
19th after reaching the finals, semifinals and quarterfinals so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being one of the favorites at the Op Junior, Robb also will surf in 
the men's pro competition this week. He needs the Op qualifying points to make 
the world tour next year. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be free to travel as a pro, having received his high-school degree a 
year early. His parents schooled him at home, and he finished with the 
equivalent of a 3.8 grade-point average, not an easy task considering he 
studied and took tests while traveling the world to compete in amateur 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never home, so I was always lugging these book bags everywhere," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the only luggage Robb carries is the burden of being one of the top 
amateurs. At the Op Junior, everyone is gunning for Robb and defending junior 
champion Chris Strother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the final last year and got off to a good start," Robb said, "but for 
the next 10 minutes, I couldn't catch a wave. There was nothing. So I'm hoping 
I can do better this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Robb had similar problems in his main-event heat at last year's Op, and lost 
in the first round. That will provide a little motivation for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Op (main event) is my main concern this year," Robb said. "I'm looking at 
that even more than the junior competition this year."

HUNTINGTON BEACH'S ALLERTON ADVANCES IN THE WAKE OF A LEGEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Eve Allerton surfed against Frieda Zamba in the semifinals of the Op Pro 
last year, Allerton felt lucky just to lose to the surfing legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamba, a four-time world champion, had won the contest five times. Allerton, a 
Huntington Beach native, was competing in her first Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the two met again in the second round of trials, and after 20 
minutes of tension for Allerton, both advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamba, as expected, dominated from the opening siren. Scoring four- and 
five-point waves to her competitors two- and three-pointers, Zamba's appearance 
in the main event was never in doubt. The only reason she started with the 
trials is that, in semi-retirement now, she hasn't surfed enough events to be 
seeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Allerton, at the other extreme, was in third place with two minutes left in 
the 20-minute heat. Finally she caught the wave she needed, scored a 3.17 and 
then closely guarded her lead as the clock ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real heart-stopper out there," Allerton said. "I got lucky at the 
end and then I just sat on that other girl. I got so close to her, I didn't 
want her even looking at another wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Oceanside's Liz Motshagen, 28, the other girl, missed the cut by .51 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Allerton began surfing at 14 and surfed competitively for Edison High. She 
continued competing for Golden West College, where she won the national 
collegiate championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no stranger to tight heats," she said. "But this was a little too close. 
I'm definitely going to enjoy this tonight. I'll probably take all my friends 
out for drinks. This is like the Olympics for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Allerton, Zamba and others who advanced will surf again in the main round at 
4:20 p.m. Thursday. Joining them will be 16 of the world's best surfers, 
including Nea Post of Huntington Beach, Alisa Schwarzstein of Laguna Beach and 
Lisa Andersen from Ormond Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first round of men's surfing, Scott Finn of Dana Point, David Pina of 
Anaheim, Billy Oswald and Barry Deffenbaugh of Huntington Beach advanced to the 
second round of trials, which begins today at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Op Junior, the high score went to Corey Lopez of Florida. He scored 
24.03 on four waves and will surf again in Heat 4 of the quarterfinals, 
scheduled for 4:40 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Today's schedule: 6-11:20 a.m., men's surfing trials Round 2, Heats 1-16; 
11:20 a.m.-4:40 p.m., men's surfing trials Round 3, Heats 1-16, 4:40-7:20 p.m.

DUKES GRAB A THIRD WEST DIVISION TITLE; TENNIS: A 28-17 VICTORY OVER CHARLOTTE 
PUTS NEWPORT BEACH IN THE PLAYOFFS AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only about 600 fans were at the John Wayne Tennis Club to see it, but the 
Dukes clinched their third consecutive West Division title in convincing 
fashion Tuesday night with a 28-17 victory over the Charlotte Express in World 
TeamTennis action. 
</P>
<P>
 In running their winning streak to 11 matches, the Dukes also clinched the 
WTT's best record, which gives them a first-round bye in the playoffs and 
automatically qualifies them for the semifinals next Friday or Saturday in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the St. Louis Aces and the Phoenix Smash, who the Dukes play twice, stand 
in the way of an undefeated season for the Dukes. However, the Dukes' Kelly 
Jones tried to stay away from talk about a perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's distracting if don't think about the next match and you start looking 
ahead," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charlotte's Johan Kriek said the Dukes shouldn't have anything to worry 
about. He doesn't see the Dukes losing this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're too strong," Kriek said. "If they keep Zina (Garrison Jackson) 
strong, nobody's going to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 As well as Charlotte (5-6) played early in the match, the Dukes couldn't 
afford to look ahead. Garrison Jackson, who returned seven hours before the 
match from her whirlwind trip to Germany for the Federation Cup, got off to a 
slow start with her doubles partner, Larisa Neiland. The WTT's top-ranked duo 
lost to Jenny Byrne and Mercedes Paz, the ninth-ranked team, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garrison Jackson recovered nicely as she beat Paz, and Byrne, who replaced 
Paz at 0-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really tired, but I didn't feel the jet lag until I sat down (after 
playing two sets)," she said. "I was attacking really well in singles." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Trevor Kronemann began attacking Kriek and Byron Talbot after 
Kronemann's serve was broken and Charlotte took a 4-1 lead in the set. Jones 
and Kronemann took four consecutive games and eventually won the set, 6-5, in a 
tiebreaker during which they trailed 4-2 with Kriek serving. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones and Kronemann picked on Talbot to take the last three points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Byron pulled a back muscle last week and he was playing hurt," said Kriek, 
defending his partner's poor play. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriek and Jones then played maybe the most entertaining sets of the home 
season as they traded spectacular shots. Jones wound up winning, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing some great points," Jones said. "It's nice to play tennis 
like that, especially when the crowd's really into it." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how small that crowd might be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to be disappointed when the people that do come are really into the 
match," Jones said. "If the ones that are here are having a good time, that's 
what matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Kronemann and Neiland closed out the match with a 6-1 victory over Kriek and 
Byrne.

DIGEST: GASTON WINS U.S. WOMEN'S AMATEUR GOLF QUALIFIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Something about the Old Ranch Country Club in Seal Beach appeals to Andrea 
Gaston of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston shot a four-under-par 68 at Old Ranch on Tuesday to take medalist 
honors in a sectional qualifier for the U.S. Women's Amateur, to be held next 
month in Hot Springs, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston, 36, won a qualifier for the U.S. Women's Open on July 8 at Old Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston hit 16 of 18 greens and holed a chip shot for a birdie on another hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a real hard day for my caddie," Gaston said. "She just kept handing 
me the putter every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston led a list of six area players who qualified at Old Ranch -- Linda Chen 
Olsen of Granada Hills, who shot 74 to finish in a two-way tie for second; 
Clarissa Childs of Glendale (77); Jody Duclos of Moorpark (78); Elise Kimm of 
Valley Village (79) and Sylvia Kim of Chatsworth (79).

NEWSWIRE: A SUSPENSION FOR SCHUMACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Schumacher's dominance of the Formula One season was sidetracked 
Tuesday, and the two-week suspension he received for breaking the circuit's 
rules could cost him the points championship. 
</P>
<P>
 International Automobile Federation (FIA) officials barred the German driver 
from the next two Grand Prix races, giving Damon Hill a chance to win the title 
Schumacher appeared to have locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher, who has won six of eight races this season with seconds in the 
other two, had no comment, but was on the verge of tears when he left FIA 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher was penalized for passing Hill on a warm-up lap and temporarily 
ignoring a black flag during the British Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver's Benetton-Ford team called the punishment "harsh" but declined 
further comment, saying it was still deciding whether to appeal. Jurisprudence 
</P>
<P>
 A jury ruled that former Detroit Lions player Reggie Rogers must pay $375,000 
to the family of one of three teen-agers killed when he ran a stopsign while 
drunk and struck their vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The defensive end was convicted of negligent homicide in the 1988 crash in 
Pontiac, Mich., and served 12 1/2 months of a 16- to 24-month prison sentence. 
Rogers broke his neck in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 William Hardy, the first player in English rugby to be prosecuted for a death 
on the field, was found not guilty of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Harness driver Danny Ricco Jr., 27, pleaded guilty to sports bribery charges, 
saying he agreed to lose a race in exchange for bribes at Monticello Raceway in 
White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Smith, the former Boston Celtics guard convicted in the hit-and-run 
deaths of two college students, was released after more than two years in 
prison. Smith, 26, returned to Washington, his hometown. His lawyer, Dennis 
Kelly, said Smith would not grant interviews. Tennis

 U.S. Naval Academy officials said they've decided to eliminate rules allowing 
athletes to miss inspections and marching drills. Such rules gave the wrong

California Lutheran, was listed in serious condition at Simi Valley Hospital 
and Health Care Center after an automobile accident Sunday night. Tapp,

 Stocks sagged Tuesday under the weight of disappointing corporate earnings and 
worries about rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, long-term Treasury bond yields rose after the market 
swallowed $17.25 billion in new two-year notes. Unimpressive quarterly results 
from a few blue chip companies depressed the Dow Jones industrial average, 
which finished off 6.16 points at 3,735.68. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers led gainers by about 5 to 4 on the Big Board, where the trading pace 
remained sluggish. New York Stock Exchange volume came to 231.14 million 
shares, compared to Monday's even lighter 213.47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mexican stocks surged to their highest level in six weeks amid 
optimism that second-quarter earnings for leading companies will meet 
expectations. The Bolsa average climbed 79.46 points to 2393.40. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the positive earnings news of Telmex, Grupo Carso and other companies," 
investors bought shares of other companies that will report second-quarter 
earnings later this week, said Al Hassinger, a trader at Abaco International. 
</P>
<P>
 Other foreign markets also closed higher. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX 
average ended up 15.74 at 2,151.96, while Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average 
closed at 20,345.37, up 47.71 points. London's Financial Times 100-share 
average rose 11.1 points to 3,117.2. 
</P>
<P>
 The downturn on Wall Street coincided with an uneasy atmosphere in the bond 
market as the Treasury sold $17.30 billion in two-year notes. The market failed 
to improve much in the afternoon even though demand for the new paper turned 
out to be slightly better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing down bonds were lingering concerns that today's auction of five-year 
notes might get a cool reception, which would tend to push interest rates 
higher. The fact that the calendar is crowded with Treasury debt sales in the 
near future added to the anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the key 30-year bond rose to 7.54% from 7.52% on Monday. Its 
price dropped 3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 in face value. Yield and price 
move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 But prices of shorter-term maturities were unchanged to 1/32 point higher, and 
intermediate securities fell between 1/32 point and 1/8 point, the Telerate 
Inc. financial information service said.  
</P>
<P>
 While watching the edgy bond market, equity investors monitored corporate 
earnings reports. Three stocks that are components of the Dow industrial 
average -- Boeing, Chevron and Eastman Kodak -- were among the issues that 
suffered earnings-related setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Digital Equipment rose 1 to 19 3/4 after reporting a fourth-quarter loss but 
vowing to claw back to profitability by the end of the calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boeing fell 7/8 to 45 1/8 after posting a 48% drop in its second-quarter 
profit due to sharply lower sales. It said commercial jet deliveries are 
expected to remain low through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chevron took a hit in heavy turnover, falling 3/8 to 43 after posting a low 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Results from Eastman Kodak came in close to predictions, but the stock still 
tumbled 1 5/8 to 47 7/8 in active Big Board volume. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurer Lincoln National tumbled 4 5/8 to 38 1/4 on disappointing results. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer chip maker Cirrus Logic rose 2 to 27 7/8 after reporting a sharp 
rise in its first-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seagull Energy fell 1 1/2 to 24 3/8. Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on 
the stock to "market performer." 
</P>
<P>
 * Software company Powersoft slid 7 1/2 to 43 in heavy Nasdaq trading after 
company officials said third-quarter earnings would be even or below those 
posted in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just nothing compelling to make investors either buy or sell, and as 
a result they're doing nothing," said Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst at 
Kidder Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
 With the likelihood of the year's fifth Federal Reserve Board hike in 
short-term interest rates hanging over the market, no one is feeling too 
adventurous, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors are not really expecting a lot out of the stock market right now," 
said James Walline, vice president of equities at the Lutheran Brotherhood 
investment firm. "I think they're biding their time." 
</P>
<P>
 Worries about rising lending rates, coupled with the steady stream of 
quarterly earnings reports, kept traders focused on single stocks rather than 
broad trends, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're just in there trying to cherry-pick the ones that can do well and just 
trying to avoid getting swamped by macro-trends that you have little or no 
control over," said Douglas Myers, vice president of trading at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar ended mostly lower against key currencies in a second 
consecutive session of quiet trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar was quoted at 98.28 Japanese yen, down from 98.75 on 
Monday. It also fell against the German mark, ending at 1.584 marks, down from 
1.590. 
</P>
<P>
 In the commodities market, platinum futures prices shot to their highest level 
in more than 3 1/2 years on forecasts for strong Japanese demand and worries 
about supply disruptions in South Africa and Russia, the two largest producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum for October delivery surged $9.40 on the New York Merc to $430.50 an 
ounce, the highest settlement for near-term deliveries since November, 1990. 
September palladium rose $4.15 to $153.95 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices also advanced. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold rose $2.20 
to settle at $387.10 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 On other commodity markets, crude oil futures fell; coffee weakened; grains 
and soybeans were mostly higher; livestock and meat futures ended mixed.

 Party on Bill: Jay Leno, on the President attending his high school reunion 
last weekend in Arkansas while his wife was on the health-care reform bus in 
Oregon: "He said he danced until 2:30 a.m. and then played cards in his hotel 
room with a bunch of guys until four in the morning. Look, if Hillary buys it, 
who are we to question it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he noticed that things had changed since high school graduation, 
reports comedy writer Mark Miller: "For example, Missy Swanson said that she 
would go out with him now, and that, in retrospect, it was a mistake to have 
passed Bill by for Eddie 'The Booze Hound' Jacobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Top 10 things overheard at the reunion, according to David 
Letterman: 
</P>
<P>
 * "More Whitewater punch, Mr. President?" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Howsabout lowering taxes for your old gym class buddy?" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bill, do you plan to move back to Arkansas in 1996?" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Well, Mr. Bully isn't so tough now that I control nuclear weapons, is he?" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Run for your lives! He's got the saxophone!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the news: Comic Argus Hamilton, on the meeting between Israel's Yitzhak 
Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein: "President Clinton wept as he watched a 
socialist and a playboy vowing to get along. It reminded him so much of his 
wedding day." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, on the popularity of Washington as a tourist attraction: "There's 
nothing like all the pomp and pageantry. Twice a day, tourists line up around 
the White House to see the Changing of the Haiti Policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Bob Mills says Haitian military leaders have notified Washington 
that they're prepared to surrender if the U. S. Army has any plans to air-drop 
emergency supplies to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on Rohan Marley, a college football player and son 
of the late reggae star Bob Marley, pleading not guilty to trying to hit a 
police officer with his truck: "When asked about other alleged attacks on local 
cops, Marley replied: 'I shot the sheriff, but I did not kill the deputy.' "

LAUGH LINES; FOR A BIT MORE, WE'LL THROW IN STEAK SAUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLIE WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I had stopped by the market last week to pick up some steaks for dinner when I 
noticed four guys with cheap suits and fresh haircuts milling around the meat 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon one approached and extended his hand: "Hi, I'm Dave." I told him my name, 
and he asked if he could help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly hope so," I replied. "I can't find the $1.89 steaks my wife told 
me to pick up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave said that I had found the right guy, that he was a Customer Service 
Account Adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 I told him that I had never heard of such a thing in a grocery store; he said 
it was new and assured me it was to benefit the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then can you tell me where the cheap sirloins are?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those babies were gone five minutes after the doors opened this morning," 
Dave said. "Ron over there moved one unit, Ted closed a deal and I sold one 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 I apparently looked puzzled, so he continued: "I can't believe people don't 
read the fine print. Our ad stated that we had only three steaks available at 
that special $1.89 price. It even had the serial numbers for the sale steaks." 
</P>
<P>
 He offered to show me some others, and pointed out some Kansas City strip 
steaks: "I saw you eyeing these babies. I can put them on your table for a nice 
price." 
</P>
<P>
 I said $5.99 a pound was too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget the sticker," he said. "Nobody pays that. And this month we've got a 
slaughterhouse rebate, first-time buyer's incentive and a program for college 
grads. We can negotiate: Just tell me what I have to do to earn your business." 
</P>
<P>
 I was confused: "So how much is the KC strip, bottom line?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dave ignored me, saying, "Make an offer I can take to my manager." 
</P>
<P>
 I said I could probably afford around $4 a pound, but wasn't sure if I really 
wanted strip steaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave's voice raised a notch, he talked faster: "You gotta trust me here, 
Charlie . . . it's Charlie, right? . . . I'm working for you here, Charlie, and 
will bust my butt to get you a great deal. But my boss won't even look at an 
offer of less that $4.50. I want you to have these steaks, Charlie. This is not 
just about me selling you something, this is about us developing a continuing 
relationship, Charlie." 
</P>
<P>
 I told him to offer $4.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave disappeared for a few minutes, then returned with his assistant manager, 
Larry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a slight problem here, Charlie, and I apologize in advance," Larry 
said. "Dave's working very hard for you and I'm on your side, too, but we don't 
have many strips left. I don't know if you saw the couple standing by the 
strips earlier. Well, they're making an offer right now for all eight we have 
left. I can probably get you four, Charlie, but not at $4.50." 
</P>
<P>
 I glanced at my watch: "OK, I'll go $5.50 on the strips, if you throw in a 
loaf of garlic bread." 
</P>
<P>
 They reached for my hand in unison and Larry spoke: "Done. Dave'll take you to 
the finance office to work out the details and paperwork with Debbie." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie shook my hand and, when Dave left, whispered: "You made quite a deal, 
you ought to teach a negotiating class. I've never seen them give free garlic 
bread for KC strips at $6 a pound." 
</P>
<P>
 I smiled, pleased she appreciated my skills. Then it sunk in and I protested: 
"But I only agreed to $5.50." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," she said, "the steaks you bought already had custom trim. That's 50 
cents extra. We can't put the fat back on now, can we?" 
</P>
<P>
 I was too tired to argue, but she never missed a trick: "Do you want any 
special seasonings -- we now offer Cajun, barbecue, aromatic Sichuan and our 
newest and most popular, pesto -- or bacon wrapping? It's just a bit extra. Did 
you want tenderness insurance?" 
</P>
<P>
 I declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave walked in as I was writing a check and escorted me to the door: "Enjoy 
those steaks, Charlie -- it's Charlie, right? Here's my card, tell your friends 
about me. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you need some nice mushrooms for those steaks, here's my brother 
Tony's card. He just started over in produce and can get you a helluva deal on 
mushrooms."

THE FAMILY FILE: 90S FAMILY; LOOKING FOR THE CHILD CARE MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from Times staff and news services. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In search of a model to address the "quiet crisis" afflicting this country's 
youngest children, Columbia University family policy experts Sheila B. Kamerman 
and Alfred J. Kahn have turned their sights toward Europe, where paid and 
job-protected maternity/paternity leave are universal, and where child care is 
not considered the purview solely of "at risk" families. 
</P>
<P>
 In their report, "A Welcome for Every Child: Care, Education and Family 
Support for Infants and Toddlers in Europe," the researchers note that in many 
European countries, child care and family support services are seen as vital to 
the cognitive and social development of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Child care services in these countries are expensive, but heavily subsidized, 
Kamerman and Kahn report; parent fees for child care constitute less than 10% 
of the average income of families who use them. 'Work Won't Love You Back' 
</P>
<P>
 There's a new manual for dual-career couples with the chillingly apt title of 
"Work Won't Love You Back" (W.H. Freeman, 1994). The book, by psychologists 
Stevan E. and Ivonne H. Hobfoll -- a husband/wife team with three children -- 
urges parents to make family-centered accommodations, because "no one on their 
death bed has ever wished they had spent more time at work." Hints at the 
Causes of Child Behavior 
</P>
<P>
 Write what you know, the old axiom goes, and so Cathy Rindner Tempelsman has 
penned "Child-Wise" (Morrow, 1994). The book, a "compassionate" guide to 
parent-child relationships, draws on Tempelsman's own experiences as the 
working mother of three children to help parents as they react to everyday 
problems with their children. While no one can explain why children do what 
they do, this author offers earthy and empathetic insights into the mystery of 
child behavior. Unmarried-Couple Category Mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
 A Census Bureau study, "Marital Status and Living Arrangements: March 1993," 
has found that there were 3.5 million unmarried-couple households in 1993, up 
from just 523,000 in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 It also found that the median age for first marriage was 26.5 in 1993 for men 
and 24.5 for women, up from 23.2 and 20.8 respectively in 1970. The number of 
women living alone rose 94% from 7.3 million to 14.2 million between 1970 and 
1993. In the same period men living alone increased 167% from 3.5 million to 
9.4 million.

RSVP; THE PARTY GOES ON -- AS DOES THE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though the elections in South Africa were three months ago, the party's not 
over yet. At least that's what was said at "Free at Last: A Celebration of 
South Africa" held Monday at Georgia, a restaurant on Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been celebrating since the election," said musician Lebo M., "I won't 
stop until I get tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Celebration was just part of the evening's message. The other was political: 
Apartheid might be gone, but many problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first step has been accomplished. Now we have to be engaged just as much 
as before," said Danny Glover, who co-founded Artists for a Free South Africa 
in 1990. AFSA hosted the event with the Reebok Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the party was as much a media event as a fund-raiser, there was a large 
press contingent wandering through Georgia's patio. "Information goes out in a 
form that's digestible, a media blurb here, a media blurb there," said Glover. 
"People sense what's happening in the world through media blurbs. Hopefully, 
then you can take them a little further in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 The process at Georgia began with a reception where 275 guests -- among them 
Tom Hayden, Holly Hunter, Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, Robert Guillaume, Max 
Gail and Mike Farrell -- reached for hors d'oeuvres of spareribs and fried 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 In the crowd, South African singer Letta Mbulu said Los Angeles reminds her of 
Durban. Frik Schoombee, the South African consul general, praised his country's 
Cabernet Sauvignon, "the product of 300 years of intensive wine making," which 
is available here now that the boycott is over. Howard Hesseman showed off his 
shirt that featured Nelson Mandela's picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding his presidential shirt, Hesseman quipped, "You could have a Bill 
Clinton shirt, but you couldn't keep it on." 
</P>
<P>
 The formal part of the program varied between speeches and performance. A 
general rule: The music was fantastic, the speeches somewhat less than 
fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
 High points included the reading of a Mongane Wally Serote poem by Roscoe Lee 
Browne in his stentorian voice; remarks by Glover and Alfre Woodard and -- best 
of all -- the performance by Lebo M., who's best known for his music in "The 
Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to say here," said AFSA director Sharon Gelman, "is the 
struggle was victorious and the work has just begun."

FAMILY; CIRCUS TROUPE GETS AUDIENCE INTO ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The judge is an octopus, the lawyer is -- what else -- a shark, and a killer 
whale sings the blues because the groupers laugh at his tutu. These eccentrics 
are part of San Francisco's 21-year-old, one-ring Make*A*Circus, visiting 
Southland parks with its crowd-pleasing, kid-friendly combination of offbeat 
comedy theater, circus stunts, audience involvement and live jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The professional troupe is performing its three-hour, free family show Friday 
at Paramount Park, Saturday at Wilson Park in Torrance and Sunday at Beach Park 
in Bakersfield. In mid-August, it returns for shows at several other Southland 
locations. The Make*A*Circus formula: troupe members put on a scripted comedy 
filled with circus derring-do and high jinks, take a break and teach audience 
members of all ages a few rudiments of juggling, tumbling, pyramid building and 
stilt-walking, then they pop the new performers into a second scripted 
"community" show. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody gets into the act in this year's second show, "Water World," about a 
greedy developer who builds an underwater shopping mall/amusement park and is 
put on trial by angry sea creatures.  
</P>
<P>
 "All the children in the workshops get to be different animals living on the 
coral reef," said artistic director Peggy Ford. There are "dolphins, dancing 
shrimps, spider crabs on stilts . . . and then we have a big ring dance where 
we invite the whole audience to come up and celebrate the end of the day with 
us," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Audience participation is part of the first company show, too. "Pirates!" is 
about shipwrecked buccaneers who try "to scrape up a new crew" at the circus, 
according to writer/director Drew Letchworth, who was with comedy troupe 
Fratelli Bologna for 12 years and was a Make*A*Circus performer in the early 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the emphasis is comedy, there is a message underneath all the 
clowning, comic chases, jokes, stilt-walking, bungee jumping, pole-climbing and 
trapeze stunts, Letchworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's seeing that while pirates are romantic and glorified -- just like gangs 
-- and people join to belong to something cool, you have to deal with the fact 
that the pirate's job is to pirate -- to maraud, burn and kill," Letchworth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My emphasis as a writer, actor, director and comedian are generally not 
social -- I'm looking for broad characters and broad comedy. But we wanted that 
theme to be the pulse of the circus." 
</P>
<P>
 So, although the circus "kids" (circus professionals in their 20s and 30s) 
"really get into" pirating at first, they have second thoughts. Meanwhile, the 
captain learns some manners, sort of, and his parrot (aerialist Nikki Byrd) 
learns to fly. 
</P>
<P>

TV RATINGS; NBC'S 'FRASIER' STANDS ALONE AT THE TOP

 There were cheers for "Frasier" this week at NBC as the hit Thursday night 
comedy recorded its first win in the national A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, which 
were released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, which stars Kelsey Grammer, had tied for first place the week of May 
16 with its lead-in, "Seinfeld," but had never before reached the No. 1 spot on 
its own.The win gave NBC extra reason to feel confident as "Frasier" gets ready 
for its upcoming move to Tuesday nights at 9 this fall to do battle with either 
of ABC's powerhouses "Roseanne" or "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Those daytime crime-fighters "The Mighty Morphin Rangers" also scored points 
in their first prime-time outing last Thursday at 8:30 p.m. on Fox. The special 
won out over its competition locally and also drew respectable national 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing less than respectable numbers was the CBS Reports special "Hitler and 
Stalin: A Legacy of Hate" Thursday, hosted by Charles Kuralt and H. Norman 
Schwarzkopf. The documentary landed in 57th place, tied with "Dr. Quinn, 
Medicine Woman," "Lois & Clark" and "Picket Fences." Southland Ratings

MIKE PENNER: MAGIC MUST SETTLE FOR PLAYTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been two years since the Dream Team pulled out of Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more months and the "retirement" press conference that put his face on 
the cover of Time and Newsweek will mark its third anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want to do," Magic Johnson said Tuesday night in Irvine, "is own a team 
and relax." 
</P>
<P>
 And about that triple-double Magic rolled out there on the Bren Center floor 
minutes earlier? 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four points. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh that ?  
</P>
<P>
 "Aww, you know, I'm just an old guy trying to stay in shape," Johnson said, 
beaming like a Cheshire cat in XXXL sweats, his head rocking to and fro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I just got lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe Coach Magic would still have his job if he could have activated 
Point Guard Magic instead of bumping him upstairs alongside Jerry Buss. Can 
Magic still play? "That's not the question," said a fairly awe-struck Adam 
Keefe, who happened to be on the right side of the ball for the second annual 
Magic Johnson Classic. "The question is if he'd be MVP." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 With or without a Michael Jordan comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been hearing, just talking to the guys, that he has not missed a step," 
Keefe said, still huffing and puffing after a 155-149 victory by the Magic 
Johnson All-Stars over the NBA Pros. "And some people think he's even gotten 
better. With all this time off, he's been working on his shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see: 13-of-24 from the field, including a three-point set shot; 39 
minutes played, more than any of his teammates; more than a point per minute in 
a game that began as a footrace and ended as a shotgun scramble from baseline 
to baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is crazy, I know," Magic said, "but I am in better shape now. I'm bigger 
up top, because I've been lifting weights. I can take a blow better and give a 
blow back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys out there were saying, 'Man, look how big your arms are. Your chest.' I 
tell them, 'Hey, I been working out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Keefe, who grew up near where the Bren Center stands, playing his high school 
ball at Woodbridge, had only watched Magic from afar before Tuesday's 
exhibition provided a life experience. Incredibly, Keefe was out there running 
the floor in front of 4,920 screaming fans -- about 2,920 more than usually 
visit the Bren for UC Irvine home games -- and he was running the break 
alongside Magic, taking feeds from Magic and calling him by his given name by 
the final buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Old friends, after 155 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a blast, playing with Earvin," Keefe said. "I was looking forward to 
this game as much as any I've ever played. He was just like you always remember 
him -- fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I had to do was run the floor and put my arms in the air. You know he'll 
always get you the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 For $6 a seat, Magic gave the crowd triple-double its money's worth -- and if 
this was the opening act for NBA-ready Orange County, what are the Clippers 
going to do to follow it up? 
</P>
<P>
 How're you going to get them down to The Pond once they've seen Magic go for 
44? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to get out there and play and still do what you can do -- or do 
what you used to do," Magic said. "People sometimes think, 'Aw, he's not in 
shape, he's too old.' I like to lay to rest in their minds that nothing's 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Banned by Karl Malone and the Raging Paranoids of the HIV-Afraid NBA, Magic 
gets most of his PT in exhibitions such as this, or with his globe trotting 
all-star team that just returned from tuning up the Puerto Rico national team 
before the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we got a 12-game schedule in Europe coming up in September," Magic said. 
"And six games in Australia. We're going to Argentina. I'm getting a lot of 
games in. I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Magic doesn't play for the rings or championship banners to further 
wallpaper the inside of the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he plays for the double-takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm driving, going to the right hand, then to the left hand, then to the 
basket and I hear someone say, 'Man, this guy's retired!' " Magic said, 
laughing one more time. "I like to show the people that I haven't lost a step. 
I still have all my quickness." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind Horace Grant and Danny Manning, the free agents du jour that Magic 
and Jerry West are considering throwing wheelbarrows of cash at. 
</P>
<P>

CSU, HUFFMAN GET OUT-OF-COURT DEAL; JURISPRUDENCE: THE SYSTEM AGREES TO PAY 
FORMER TITAN VOLLEYBALL COACH $1.35 MILLION PLUS LEGAL FEES IN WRONGFUL 
TERMINATION CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 2 1/2-year legal battle between former Cal State Fullerton volleyball 
Coach Jim Huffman and the Cal State University system ended Tuesday when 
attorneys reached an out-of-court settlement of the coach's 
wrongful-termination case. 
</P>
<P>
 The CSU system has agreed to pay Huffman $1.35 million and an additional 
$300,000 in attorney fees -- the exact amounts a Superior Court jury and judge 
ordered the system to pay Huffman last winter. In exchange for dropping its 
appeal of the Feb. 8 verdict, the CSU system will not have to pay any interest 
on the award, which had been accruing at a rate of 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides have confirmed the agreement by letter, and Huffman is expected 
to sign formal settlement papers today, after which the CSU system will have 30 
days to pay the former coach. The money will come out of its general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to sound overconfident, but we didn't think they would win an 
appeal," said Huffman, who said he was unfairly fired after he fought and 
blocked Fullerton's effort to drop the women's volleyball program in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to know this won't drag into next year. I'm definitely ready to 
move on. It's going to be nice not being in the paper every other week." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement brings to $2.6 million the amount that the San Francisco firm 
of Boyd, Huffman & Williams has won for clients in six cases against the CSU 
system in the last 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm netted $375,000 in San Diego State volleyball Coach Rudy Suwara's 
wrongful-termination suit, $328,000 in San Jose State administrator Mary 
Zimmerman's sex-discrimination and wrongful-termination suit, $200,000 in 
attorneys fees for California National Organization for Women cases against CSU 
and San Jose State, and $108,000 in attorney fees in the Fullerton volleyball 
team's sex-discrimination case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see if CSU has learned a lesson worth $2.6 million," said attorney 
Jared Huffman, Jim's brother. "I think if they were a little more open-minded 
and had better leadership, that figure would have been a lot lower and a lot of 
careers would still be intact." 
</P>
<P>
 The CSU system hired the San Francisco firm of Sedgwick, Detert, Moran & 
Arnold to handle the appeal in the Huffman case, but attorney Fred Baker 
deferred comments to the CSU system office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weighed the risks, and looking at 10% interest and (additional) 
attorneys fees, they decided it was fiscally prudent to settle it now," said 
CSU spokeswoman Colleen Bentley-Adler. "It was time to wrap this up. . . . We 
would have preferred winning the case, but this allows the campus to get along 
with its program and look ahead, not back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Huffman, who had a 25-80 record in three years as Titan coach, was fired 
in March, 1992, one working day after a judge signed a preliminary injunction 
blocking the school's January, 1992, attempt to drop volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 The university contended it acted properly when it fired Huffman. But 
Huffman's attorneys successfully argued during a three-week trial last winter 
that the coach was fired in retaliation for his sex-discrimination lawsuit that 
saved women's volleyball, forced changes in the school's athletic policies and 
embarrassed the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman, who works at an Anaheim sports apparel company, was awarded $350,366 
in projected financial losses and $1 million in non-economic damages. Two 
Fullerton administrators, including former Athletic Director Bill Shumard, were 
ordered to pay a total of $4,500 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Huffman's attorneys, CSU officials turned down a settlement offer 
of $350,000 last November, just two months before the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at it objectively, this was a case they had to settle," Jared 
Huffman said. "They sized it up and did the proper thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Huffman, 35, said he would like to return to Division I college coaching, 
"but I'll have to sit back for a couple years to let this really die down 
before I test the waters again," he said. "I'll probably have to start off 
again as an assistant. I'll be almost 40, an assistant . . . it's not real 
inspiring, is it?"

HULL ISN'T SMILING ABOUT THE THOUGHT OF PLAYING FOR KEENAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much of St. Louis is delirious over the arrival of Mike Keenan -- as if the 
Stanley Cup will inevitably follow after he serves a 60-day NHL suspension for 
jumping from the New York Rangers to the Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 But one prominent citizen isn't sure the relationship is going to work: Brett 
Hull. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull said diplomatically Tuesday that hiring Keenan as coach and general 
manager is "great for the organization," but admitted that he has misgivings 
about how he will get along with Keenan, who brought the Rangers their first 
Stanley Cup in 54 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I play the game is totally different from the way he would like his 
players to play the game," said Hull, in Anaheim for a youth hockey camp. 
"Like, I can't play without smiling out there. I can imagine when he sees me 
smiling out there in Chicago Stadium or Maple Leaf Gardens, he'd absolutely 
have a conniption fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great coach, a great hockey man. But I play the game with a lot of fun 
and high spirits. And the more serious you try to make the game, the worse I'm 
going to be. So, to me, I find it hard to believe that my personality and his 
are going to get along too well. Although he's a great man away from the game, 
from what I understand about his coaching style, I just can't imagine him 
enjoying the way I play." 
</P>
<P>
 Hull, a five-time All-Star right winger who has led the NHL in goals three 
times but is thought by many observers to be a one-dimensional player, has 
become emblematic of hockey in St. Louis. However, he has become increasingly 
disgruntled in recent years because of the trades of linemate Adam Oates in 
1992 and close friend Garth Butcher last season. This year, there has been 
speculation that he, too, might be traded before completing the final two years 
of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 If he were to have any say in it, such a trade would be to the Kings, to play 
with close friend Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my dream," Hull said. "For a goal-scorer to be able to play with the 
greatest there ever was, or is . . . in L.A. I'd like to play with Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always tough to say, but I think I've traveled my course in St. Louis 
and it's time for me to move on. . . . I love St. Louis and I'll always love 
it. Right now, at this point in my career, I think I need a spark, something to 
make the game fun again." 
</P>
<P>
 One trade rumor before the June draft had the Kings offering defenseman Darryl 
Sydor, forward Mike Donnelly and the No. 7 choice to St. Louis for Hull. But 
the Blues are said to have wanted defenseman Rob Blake instead. Both teams 
denied to agent Michael Barnett, who represents Hull and Gretzky, that they 
discussed a deal. And Barnett said the Blues have never told him that they've 
considered trading Hull. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that hasn't kept Hull and Gretzky from entertaining the idea of playing 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're such good friends, there's always that dream of one day having 
the opportunity to play together," said Gretzky, who was at The Pond of Anaheim 
along with Hull for the Coca-Cola/Wayne Gretzky Hockey Camp. "Obviously, he's 
probably the most natural goal-scorer the game has seen in a long time, other 
than maybe Mike Bossy. Yeah, I think obviously any team would love to have 
Brett Hull. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a player of that caliber becomes a problem because it becomes somewhat of 
a dream. Teams find it difficult to trade players of that caliber, but anything 
is possible in this sport and anything can happen. Sometimes dreams become a 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 As for any interest on the Kings' part, Gretzky said: "When you miss the 
playoffs and there is a possibility of getting a player of that caliber, I 
don't think there's any discussions that need to take place." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers have been quick to wonder what kind of fit Hull and Keenan will be, 
but until now, both had downplayed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of respect for him, and I believe he respects me," Keenan told 
reporters. "At this point in his career, Brett will get the opportunity to 
develop his leadership skills and to raise his game to the next level. This is 
his chance to become a total team player. He's going to thrive here." 
</P>
<P>
 Hull praised Keenan, but with reservations, saying: "It's great for the 
organization because he knows what he wants. He's in charge and he'll make all 
the decisions, and he's proved over the years that where he goes, he brings 
winners."

MIKE DOWNEY: GO PRO? AND GIVE UP LEARNING ZULU? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he ambles across campus wearing a UCLA Bruins shirt inside-out, J.J. Stokes 
looks the picture of summer contentment. He is so pleased not to have a job. 
Everybody was fooled when he passed up the paydays of pro football to come back 
to college and catch passes, but what everybody forgot is that pro football is 
work. And that J.J. would much rather go to school than go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will you be studying?" Stokes is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The usual, sociology and psychology, he says. "Oh, and Zulu." 
</P>
<P>
 "Zulu?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," UCLA J.J. says, kicking back, cool as can be. "I need a language and I 
already know enough Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Work can wait. His father worked hard for many years for San Diego Gas & 
Electric. His mother worked hard at a naval base. One of his three much-older 
brothers works hard as a postman. Another is looking for work. The other is 
head chef at one of Switzerland's four-star hotels. So there is only so much 
time to enjoy life, before responsibilities weigh you down and you have to 
account to someone for every hour. 
</P>
<P>
 In no hurry to get where he is going, UCLA J.J., the ultimate letterman, is a 
record-breaking wide receiver about to begin his senior term. Stokes ran 
seventh in last season's Heisman Trophy voting, whereupon the six players ahead 
of him promptly turned pro. Agents assumed Stokes would follow suit. So did 
teammates. Even his quarterback, Wayne Cook, said he had set his mind that his 
favorite target was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rose Bowl game against Wisconsin approaching, UCLA's coach, Terry 
Donahue, checked to see what was on Stokes' mind. Donahue has a splendid 
description of Stokes -- he calls him "a difference-maker" -- so naturally the 
coach was curious as to his plans. Stokes said his plans were to play for UCLA. 
He didn't even intend to test the market. He was staying, so why push 
temptation? 
</P>
<P>
 When the game was over and the Bruins had lost, Cook was feeling pretty lousy 
until Stokes sidled over and said don't worry, we'll win this thing next year. 
The quarterback immediately felt better. 
</P>
<P>
 And J.J.? 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, as soon as the clock ran down, I felt more relieved than anything," 
Stokes says. "It was such a long season. I thought, now I've finally got a 
chance to relax. I could finally lay back and do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then everybody starts up with the big 'Are you going pro?' decision. I kept 
telling them there was no decision to make. For one thing, I had promised my 
parents that I would get my degree. But the other thing is, I'm enjoying 
college. Why should I be in a hurry to go to work, get up every morning, 
practice, lift, run, watch film, practice some more, day in, day out, beating 
on people all day? What for?" 
</P>
<P>
 A guy smiles and says, "For money?" 
</P>
<P>
 And Stokes busts out laughing and says, "Well, yeah. That's a good reason." 
</P>
<P>
 But not good enough. Truth is, next person who suggests that J.J. is gambling 
with his future, he might wipe away that happy face of his and scream. Yes, 
Stokes needs 15 catches to pass Sean LaChapelle as the school's leading 
receiver, and yes, LaChapelle did postpone turning pro and then got his rib 
cage racked. This simply prompts J.J. to say: "Everybody's talking about me 
getting hurt, LaChapelle this, LaChapelle that. He got hurt trying to cut-block 
a 285-pound lineman. I will run out of bounds if I have to. If I'm surrounded, 
I don't mind saying hello to the turf." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes might not catch as many passes as he did last season, primarily because 
opponents will go into their "Where's J.J.?" defense. But on the other hand, he 
might fool everybody again. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you say "Heisman Trophy" in Zulu? 
</P>
<P>
 Should he never make another catch, Stokes will always have that 90-yard 
touchdown reception of Nov. 21, 1992, a day J.J. did to USC what O.J. once did 
to UCLA. And that wasn't even Stokes' longest. He took a little flip against 
Washington last season and went 95 yards, looking over his shoulder at midfield 
with a "where'd everybody go?" 
</P>
<P>
 Today he's the best catcher in L.A. this side of Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl, Jon and Jeffrey Stokes used to take their baby brother out for a game 
of catch to show him how it was done. Darryl was a receiver for Long Beach 
State who later played some USFL ball in Chicago. Even though they were 
considerably older, J.J. says with a laugh, "They used to tackle me until I'd 
start crying." 
</P>
<P>
 His brothers are now 33, 32 and 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother and father wanted one last try for a female," J.J. says. "Too bad!" 
</P>
<P>
 On those days when he wasn't being tackled by an older brother, he was being 
fed by one. Jon Stokes used to whip up a seven-layer wedding cake, easy as pie. 
No one in the Stokes household knows for sure why the second-oldest son felt so 
at home in the kitchen. Before long, Jon was graduating from a culinary 
institute and on his way to Lucerne to the elegant Hotel des Alpes, where he 
was visited by J.J. last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, J.J. hasn't gone anywhere. But that's OK with UCLA. The Bruins 
like it when J.J. stays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just hanging around going to movies?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," he says. "Hard for me to go to a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 "How come?" 
</P>
<P>
 J.J. pats his pockets. He says: "No money."

GOODWILL GAMES; JOYNER-KERSEE WINS HEPTATHLON, BUT IT TAKES BEER, SWEAT AND 
TEARS; TRACK AND FIELD: GOLD MEDAL ALMOST GETS LOST IN RUSSIAN TRANSLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was a noble idea that Ted Turner had to bring two former cold warriors 
together in the spirit of friendly athletic competition. But then a little 
alcohol got involved, and the next thing you know, some people were crying, 
some were arguing and it seemed like only a matter of time before some would be 
taking their shoes off and banging them on the seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Joyner-Kersee won her third Goodwill Games heptathlon championship 
Tuesday, but the competition became almost as draining for her emotionally as 
it was physically when a Russian official threatened to disqualify her after 
the sixth of seven events, the javelin throw. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the only controversy at Petrovsky Stadium, where hardly anyone 
seemed to be exuding much good will. After finishing fourth in the 100 meters 
the day before, Carl Lewis withdrew from the long jump, reaping criticism from 
the winner of the event, Mike Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was an intramural dispute among Americans, nothing like the 
international incident that was almost started after the meet's assistant 
referee, Viktor Karashan, accused Joyner-Kersee of throwing a javelin that was 
flying under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode started innocently enough. While Joyner-Kersee was in the stands 
between her events, watching the men's long jump, a fan spilled a beer on the 
two javelins that were underneath the heptathlete's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 As they were the only two javelins she had, Joyner-Kersee took them to the 
room where all of the competitors' implements are tested to determine whether 
they are legal and did not give them another thought until they were delivered 
to her moments before warm-ups for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that the grips were still wet, she chose to take advantage of the 
rule that allowed her to use a javelin belonging to one of the other women. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of her three throws was 139 feet 11 inches, which was fifth best 
among the eight competitors but still earned enough points to give her an 
almost insurmountable lead entering the final event, the 800 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when Karashan approached her with an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'You used beer to give your javelins a glue effect so that you can 
get a better grip,' " she said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee defended herself, explaining, first, that the javelins were 
tested and cleared before the event and, second, that, even so, she did not use 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'You broke the rules,' " Joyner-Kersee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You mean I'm disqualified?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Yes, you broke the rules. You're disqualified.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Joyner-Kersee found her coach/husband, Bob Kersee, in the stands, she was 
in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kersee charged onto the track, he was enraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Karashan said the interpreter had misinterpreted. What he had actually said, 
Karashan said, was that Joyner-Kersee risked disqualification if she ever 
entered another competition with a loaded javelin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a warning," said Karashan, who came to the post-competition news 
conference with Joyner-Kersee to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotionally taxed and also concerned that the swirling wind that was kicking 
up dust would trigger an asthma attack, Joyner-Kersee finished last in the 800 
meters, stepping gingerly on the finish line and refusing to run one extra 
step. Her total of 6,606 points was still enough to win by 114 over Russia's 
Larisa Turchinskaya, but it was Joyner-Kersee's lowest total since she finished 
second in the 1984 Olympics, and her smallest margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Joyner-Kersee, Powell saved his best effort for last. Erick Walder 
jumped 27 feet 6 1/2 inches on his first effort, which held up until the sixth 
round when he was doomed by an act of God. Just as Powell was about to jump, 
the strongest wind of the day, 2.4 meters per second, came up from behind and 
gave him an extra push as he leaped 27-8 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was serving as a television commentator during the event, so it was only 
fair that Powell was asked later to comment on Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't even thinking about Carl Lewis," he said. "Carl Lewis hasn't jumped 
since the 1992 Olympic Games. I only think about the guys who are not only 
trying to beat me but are beating me." 
</P>
<P>
 He talked so much about Lewis, however, that it was obvious Powell has not 
been able to jump out of his rival's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jump whatever the weather, cold, wet, windy, hamstring sore, back sore," 
Powell said. "Whatever, I put it on the line. I don't think it's good that the 
Olympic champion wasn't out there to defend his title." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Lewis cannot defend his Olympic title until 1996. But he could have 
defended his Goodwill Games title, and when he chose not to do so because of 
soreness after Monday's 100 meters, the organizers were not pleased.  
</P>
<P>
 The Lewis camp, meantime, complained that the organizers should have scheduled 
the 100 for Sunday, two days before the long jump, but did not because they 
wanted that race for Turner's network, TBS, instead of ABC, which is 
broadcasting the competition on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwill Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Americans Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan won the women's gold in beach 
volleyball by beating Monica Rodrigues and Adriana Samuel of Brazil, 12-9, 
12-1. The Norwegian pair of Jan Kvalheim and Bjorn Maaseide won the men's gold, 
beating Americans Carlos Briceno and Jeff Williams, 12-8, 12-6.

COLLEGE, MINOR LEAGUE SITES LIKELY FOR TWO SEATTLE TEAMS

 The Seahawks will play at Husky Stadium and the Mariners might head to Tacoma 
while crews scrape loose ceiling tiles off the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the stadium's week-old tile problem, the Seahawks said Tuesday they 
will move their home exhibition opener on Aug. 13 against Tampa Bay to the 
University of Washington's stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners are awaiting complete league and union approval to use Tacoma's 
Cheney Stadium for their Aug. 2-10 home stand, which includes three games 
against the Angels. The Tacoma outdoor stadium, home of the Pacific Coast 
League's Tacoma Tigers, seats about 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 19, four 26-pound tiles fell 180 feet into the empty seats behind home 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Abe, spokesman for County Executive Gary Locke, said workers hope to 
have all the tiles removed by Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Abe said experts believe the bare concrete of the dome's massive roof would 
reflect so much sound that it might make the public address system useless or 
the building uncomfortably loud. 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath the off-white tiles is a black coating and gray concrete. Without a 
new covering, light levels in the dome might not be adequate, Abe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has no estimates on when or how these problems might be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there an estimate on the cost.

 The Raiders and Denver Broncos took it easy in preparation for their 
exhibition opener in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFC West rivals arrived in Barcelona on Tuesday after 12-hour-plus 
overnight trips, shook off the jet lag long enough to have brief workouts and 
then took guided tours of the Mediterranean city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and Broncos will play Sunday at the Olympic Stadium. Barcelona, 
host of the 1992 Summer Olympics, drew 45,330 for its first American Bowl last 
year. The city was the home of the World League of American Football's 
Barcelona Dragons for two seasons.

HE FINDS THINGS HAVEN'T CHANGED MUCH

 In the dim kitchen of Valery Sokolov's shelter, 72-year-old Alexei Kuzmin, an 
energetic man with a sharp wit, paces angrily. "I have to stay here for the 
next two weeks, out of sight," he said. "I'm afraid to go out during the 
Goodwill Games." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1939, Kuzmin, then 17, asked at a workers' meeting whether rumors that 
Stalin had freed the Georgian people of the obligation to pay taxes were true. 
The question cost him four years in a mental hospital, and then -- when he was 
old enough to be tried -- four years in a labor camp above the Arctic Circle as 
an "enemy of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Freed from jail in 1947, he returned to Leningrad (which this city was then 
called), hoping to get back his apartment, obtain a propiska and then find a 
job. But two days after he registered his arrival with the police, he was 
arrested and shipped "to the 101st kilometer." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next four decades, he got by on odd jobs -- repairing roofs, fixing 
cart wheels, chopping wood. He had difficulty getting hired because of his 
record of time in jail. A few years ago, he returned to Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard of this rehabilitation for political prisoners," he said. "If I got 
rehabilitated, I could get a propiska. Then I could get a pension, medical 
help."  
</P>
<P>
 Kuzmin turned for help to the KGB, the human rights group "Memorial" and the 
mayor's office. "But they all open up my passport, see I don't have a propiska 
, and that's all they need to know, they throw me out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police say, 'OK, grandpa, get lost.' I turn to (Mayor Anatoly) Sobchak's 
office, but everyone's too busy trying to please Ted Turner. If I could just 
get some legal advice on this rehabilitation, I'd be a happy man. But what help 
do we get? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're told to stay out of sight . . . . Thanks, Sobchak." MATT BIVENS

POSTCARD: ST. PETERSBURG; YOU MIGHT NEED MORE THAN A RABBIT'S FOOT TO SURVIVE

 The taxi screeched to a halt, lurching the passengers forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell?" one of us asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver did not speak English, but understood the question. He pointed 
toward a black cat that had darted across the road in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 We laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 He laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 He, however, did not proceed. Instead, he pulled over to the side of the road 
and parked. 
</P>
<P>
 It was early in the morning. The drawbridges across the Neva River are raised 
at 1:30 a.m., and if you do not get to the island of your choice before then in 
this city of canals, you are stuck where you are for 4 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we waited. For what, we did not know. But then another car passed us, 
nullifying, we decided later, the jinx of the black cat and allowing us to 
continue the trip to our hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Russian superstitions are similar to ours in the United States. Some are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 According to "St. Petersburg, the Rough Guide" by Rob Humphreys and Dan 
Richardson, "Russians consider it bad luck to kiss or shake hands across a 
threshold, or return home to pick up something that's been forgotten. If you 
step on someone's foot, they are duty-bound to do the same back to you. Before 
departing on a long journey, Russians gather all their luggage by the door and 
sit on it for a minute or two, to bring themselves luck for the journey." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman from Atlanta who works for the Goodwill Games went outside her office 
one day last week for some fresh air and sat on a concrete wall. Almost 
immediately, two Russian women grabbed her by the arms and coaxed her back to 
her feet. A friend explained to her later that Russian women believe that 
sitting on a cold surface will make them infertile. 
</P>
<P>
 That explains the problem that confronted local organizers of the Goodwill 
Games when it was suggested to them by their partners from Turner Broadcasting 
System that they replace the wooden benches inside the track and field venue, 
Petrovsky Stadium, with ones made of aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers eventually agreed, but not until Turner officials forwarded to 
them the annual birth rates in several U.S. cities where stadiums have aluminum 
benches. My sources within TBS insist this is a true story. RANDY HARVEY

COMING TO A FORK IN THE RIVER; MIDDLE FORK OF SAN JOAQUIN ISN'T FAR FROM 
CIVILIZATION, BUT IT IS A HOT SPOT FOR TROUT 
</P>

<P>
 For David Moss, there is nothing like standing in the middle of a cool-running 
river, surrounded by grassy meadows and an evergreen forest. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Moss used to work in the garment district of downtown Los Angeles. 
Standing in the middle of a mud puddle would be fine with him, as long as it's 
a mud puddle up here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have to go to Los Angeles on family business sometimes," Moss says. 
"But that's fine, as long as I know I get to come home." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss, 57, now owns a car rental company in town, but most days he can be found 
waist-deep in water somewhere on the outskirts, trying to get a rise out of a 
trout. 
</P>
<P>
 If he does, chances are the trout will soon be at the end of Moss' line. Moss 
is also one of Mammoth Lakes' top fly-fishing guides.  
</P>
<P>
 And for a price -- he works out of Kittredge Sports and charges $100 for four 
hours or $150 for a full day -- he will introduce you to the Middle Fork of the 
San Joaquin River, one of the best-kept secrets in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "People hear San Joaquin and they think you're talking about the Delta," says 
Dick Gaumer, a La Crescenta-based marketing consultant who works for the city 
of Mammoth Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss knows better. 
</P>
<P>
 The Middle Fork of the San Joaquin, with headwaters in the back country above 
town at Thousand Island Lake, runs just west of Mammoth Mountain through some 
of the most beautiful country in the state, before meeting up with the main 
river of Delta fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildflowers and cottonwoods provide a brilliant display of color each fall. 
Deer graze in the meadows, and bears sometimes wander the river's banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may be prejudiced, but I think this is prettier than Yosemite," Moss says. 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Payne, 38, a local hotel owner and avid fisherman, describes a trip to 
the San Joaquin as "a Yosemite-like experience without the crowds." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Moss and Payne are quick to point out, however, that what makes the San 
Joaquin unique is that it is the only place within a stone's throw from town -- 
it's accessible 10 minutes down the road from the U.S. Forest Service gate at 
the end of the ski area parking lot -- where an angler has an opportunity to 
accomplish a grand slam of sorts, catching four species of trout -- rainbow, 
brown, brook and golden -- in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the goldens are actually a hybrid, the result of mixed breeding with 
stocked rainbows, which are planted every other week at some of the 
campgrounds. But there are some pure goldens, differentiated by their brighter 
gold coloring, swimming the upper reaches of the river as well.  
</P>
<P>
 "Or you can try for the super grand slam," Moss says, referring to stocked and 
wild rainbows, browns, brookies and both types of goldens.  
</P>
<P>
 Such a feat is difficult, but far from impossible. The wild trout in the San 
Joaquin are simply wild about flies, or lures and bait for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The San Joaquin is a classic dry-fly stream," says Moss, who fishes the river 
about 35 days each season. "Particularly if you get away from the campgrounds 
(where the hatchery fish are stocked and tend to hold). But if they aren't 
farmed out (before the next plant), even a stocked fish will rise to a dry fly 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 So unique is the fishery that it has become a candidate for Wild Trout Stream 
status, a state listing that, if approved by the Fish and Game Commission, will 
mandate the Department of Fish and Game to take a more active role in 
protecting the wild trout in the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Restricting vehicle access helps keep the pressure down. The U.S. Forest 
Service allows cars through the gate only before 7:30 a.m. and after 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 And Steve Parmenter, a fishery biologist with the DFG, says a big step toward 
protecting wild trout populations was taken 25 years ago when the DFG stopped 
planting hatchery-raised fish in the Devil's Postpile and Soda Springs areas, 
leaving large stretches of river inhabited almost solely by wild trout. 
</P>
<P>
 So for now, the fishery seems to be in fine shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now in one riffle you may catch a brown, a brook, a (wild) rainbow and 
something resembling a golden, and there might even be some genuine goldens in 
that riffle as well," Parmenter says. "In that little valley you have that 
whole spectrum of fish." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the fish are particularly big -- a 20-inch brown is considered a prize 
catch -- but they are full of spirit. And they are apparently as plentiful as 
the mosquitoes that torment those who dare venture into the valley without 
dousing themselves with repellent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon for us to go down there and in a period of a few hours 
catch hundreds of fish," Payne says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One recent balmy afternoon, Moss set out to prove how productive the San 
Joaquin really is. 
</P>
<P>
 He parked near Pumice Flats Campground and was soon ready in waders and boots. 
Stan Elmore, a volunteer caretaker at the campground, stopped by and said he 
had to chase a bear away the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss smiled and took off along the river bank, watching the water along the 
way. He stopped about a hundred yards from the camp and carefully stepped in. 
Soon he had the fly working beautifully through the air, landing it in a shaded 
pool and drifting back through the ripples. After a few casts, a fish rose to 
the fly. On the next cast, it struck. Moss set the hook, and the fish went 
skittering across the narrow river. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss soon landed the fish, a brown trout about six inches long. He carefully 
unhooked the fish and it disappeared in a flash. 
</P>
<P>
 Working his way down the river, casting perfectly to pools beneath the 
overhanging brush, he landed a larger brown, then caught a brook trout about 
eight inches long. 
</P>
<P>
 Shadows from the pines were forming over the meadow behind the fisherman. 
There was nobody else in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour passed, and Moss, after catching and releasing several more 
brown trout and a few more brook trout, landed a golden trout that was more 
yellow than gold, with a red streak running down its side. 
</P>
<P>
 With time running out, Moss decided to go back to the campground. He waded 
into the water, mosquitoes buzzing around his head, and after about a dozen 
casts he hooked up again. The fish, a planted rainbow about 12 inches long, put 
up a decent fight, but Moss successfully brought it in, completing the grand 
slam. 
</P>
<P>
 He smiled as though he has never done this before. "So what if some of the 
fish are only three or four inches long," he says. "The idea is to fool the 
fish, any fish." 
</P>
<P>
 And there seem to be plenty of fools in the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin.

UC IRVINE'S BAKER STUDIES POSSIBLE RETURN TO SETON HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine Coach Rod Baker, who has a 23-63 record with one year remaining on 
his contract, is considering a return to Seton Hall as an assistant to recently 
hired Coach George Blaney, who was his college coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to (consider it)," said Baker, who was an assistant to P.J. Carlesimo 
at Seton Hall before taking the Irvine job in 1991. "It's a legitimate offer in 
a place where I'm comfortable, and it's something I have to investigate." 
</P>
<P>
 Blaney, 54, was named Friday to replace Carlesimo, now coach of the Portland 
Trail Blazers. Blaney had coached the previous 22 seasons at Holy Cross, 
Baker's alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine program has yet to turn the corner after three seasons under Baker. 
The Anteaters' best record since Baker replaced Bill Mulligan was last season's 
10-20 mark, punctuated by a Big West Conference tournament run that took the 
Anteaters to within a victory of their first NCAA tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem facing Baker is whether to return to Seton Hall, leaving behind a 
head coaching job and a somewhat promising team for next season, or stay, and 
risk being without a job if next season's record doesn't improve dramatically 
enough to persuade Athletic Director Dan Guerrero to renew his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it here, honestly and truly," Baker said. "I would like to get it done 
here. That's it. I really want to do well here. I want to change things." 
</P>
<P>
 Blaney said that though no formal offer has been made, the assistant's job is 
Baker's if he wants it.

 "He's like my son," Blaney said. "He's such a bright, bright guy. I'd love to 
have him, but we have to do what's right for him and right for the programs. 
He's just a terrific friend and obviously a terrific coach. . . . We're in a 
process of just talking to see if it makes sense for everybody."

MANY OF THE HARDEST WORKERS AT DEL MAR WILL BE COMMUTERS; OPENING DAY: FOR 
VARIOUS REASONS, SOME TRAINERS WILL STABLE THEIR HORSES IN L.A. AND SHIP THEM 
SOUTH AS NEEDED. 
</P>

 The I-405/I-5 corridor between Los Angeles and Del Mar, frequently a 
time-consuming obstacle course for motorists, might have more congestion this 
racing season because of horse vans rolling in and out of Hollywood Park and 
Santa Anita. As Del Mar's 43-day season opens today, a number of trainers, 
including Bobby Frankel, Neil Drysdale and Paco Gonzalez, will be drop-in 
participants, stabling and training their horses in the Los Angeles area and 
shipping them south as the races require. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel won't stable horses at Del Mar because of what he perceives to be a 
safety factor. With Drysdale, it's mainly an economic move. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Gregson, who won the 1981 Del Mar Futurity with Gato Del Sol, the year 
before the colt won the Kentucky Derby, is also tightening his stable's budget 
and is glad to be away from the crowded conditions at Del Mar during morning 
training hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the stay-away trainers don't plan to run fewer horses during Del Mar's 
55th season, but Frankel, who has won 234 races and 33 stakes at the track, 
including the last two runnings of the $1-million Pacific Classic, thinks the 
trend might affect the size of some fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got a borderline horse," Frankel said, "you'd be more likely to run 
if you're right there, but you might think twice about running if you've got to 
ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Other trainers who will be vanning horses from Hollywood Park and Santa Anita 
include Mark Hennig and Sandy Shulman, who finished second to Ron McAnally in 
the standings at the recently completed Hollywood meeting, winning 24 races 
with 109 starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar officials don't think the ship-in trainers will affect the quality of 
their Wednesday-through-Monday season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first heard about the situation, I was concerned," said Joe Harper, 
the track's general manager. "But actually we've had the biggest demand we've 
ever had for stall space, and we've even looked for extra space where we might 
add a few stalls." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper estimated Del Mar has 2,300 stalls and said the requests have reached 
about 4,000, compared to the 3,500 range in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 If opening-day entries are indicative, Del Mar will not be part of the 
national horse-shortage problem, which has been caused by too much racing and 
cutbacks in the breeding business. Today's nine-race card drew 104 entries, and 
for the sixth consecutive year the Oceanside Stakes for 3-year-olds will be 
split into two divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of horses entered for Thursday drops to 82, one of them Bertrando 
in the $60,000 Wickerr Stakes at one mile on grass. Bertrando won last year's 
Pacific Classic and has earned $3 million, but didn't race the first half of 
this year because his owners gave him an early start at a stud career. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel used to train the Eclipse Award-winning Bertrando, saddling him for 
his last start, a second-place finish behind Arcangues in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic at Santa Anita in November. But he didn't agree with the idea of 
breeding the 5-year-old before resuming his racing career. Bertrando underwent 
surgery for a chipped knee after the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's wrong with the (Del Mar) track," Frankel said. "All I 
know is that I break down a lot of horses there." 
</P>
<P>
 Drysdale started only 13 horses at Del Mar last year, but his two victories, 
in the San Clemente Handicap and the Del Mar Oaks, were important, helping pad 
a record that led to an Eclipse Award for Hollywood Wildcat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is the major factor," Drysdale said. "The prices we're charging 
to train have stayed the same, but our expenses have gone up. Vanning is not 
that big of a deal. What does it take, 45 minutes to get a horse from Hollywood 
Park to Santa Anita? Then it's only about an hour and a half from Hollywood to 
Del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners have been leaving the game in alarming numbers, and consequently many 
trainers are reluctant to increase their daily rates per horse, which are in 
the $70 range at the high end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of a trainer who's raised his rates in the last three or four 
years," Gregson said. "When you're stabled at Del Mar, you subsidize your 
stable crews because of the high summer rates down there, and I can't justify 
that any more. Part of the fun of the game is the owners going to Del Mar to 
see their horses train and race, but I didn't get any pressure from my owners 
to stable there this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track is so crowded down there in the mornings that it's not the best 
place to train. The track has so many horses on it that it can make your horses 
nervous. They did widen the track several feet, but I don't think it's helped 
that much. We (trainers) wanted a real training track, something more than the 
(half-mile) pony track that can only accommodate a couple of a horses at a 
time. Instead, they gave us an $80-million grandstand." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Two of this year's Triple Crown horses, Powis Castle and Numerous, are entered 
in races today. Powis Castle, winless this year, is the probable favorite in 
the first division of the Oceanside as he makes his first start on grass. After 
running second in the Jim Beam at Turfway Park, Powis Castle was eighth in the 
Kentucky Derby and ninth in the Preakness. Gary Stevens will ride him for the 
first time today. After winning the Derby Trial, Numerous broke poorly in the 
Preakness and finished fifth, then a bruised hoof knocked him out of another 
race on the Belmont Stakes card. His return might come at the right time for 
trainer Charlie Whittingham, who will try to use Del Mar to recover from one of 
his worst Hollywood Park seasons. In the meet that ended Monday, Whittingham 
won with only four of 70 starters and didn't win a stake at a track where he 
has won a record 817. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Free of the Daily Racing Form doesn't believe that trainers working their 
horses away from Del Mar will be an immediate handicapping factor. "These are 
all trainers who know what they're doing," Free said. "But of course if some 
sort of pattern develops after the meet starts, you'd have to start paying 
attention to it." . . . The meeting runs through Sept. 14, with first post at 2 
p.m. except on Friday, Aug. 5, when the races will start at 4 p.m. "We'll see 
how we do, and then see if it's worth doing some more next year," General 
Manager Joe Harper said. "We don't have lights, but you have to be impressed by 
the number of people Hollywood Park puts into their track on Friday nights." . 
. . For the record: Hollywood Park's daily average on-track attendance of 
12,759 represented an increase of 2.4% over the previous season.

GOLF / STEVE ELLING; FIELD AGES AS WOODS RUNS AWAY

<P>
 The waiting is the hardest part. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Woods of Cypress and Chad Wright are both 18 years old. They have 
battled innumerable times on the many junior circuits locally and nationally, 
with Woods almost always coming out on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, of Ventura, who finished 10th in his first Southern California Golf 
Assn. Amateur Championship over the weekend, is a fine player who earned a 
scholarship to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the frustration. Woods finished 10-under at the SCGA to smash several 
long-standing tournament records. 
</P>
<P>
 "They started playing together when they were about this tall," said Wright's 
father, Jim, holding a hand at belt level. "I kept telling Chad, 'Don't worry, 
you'll close the gap in a couple of years.' 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years went by and the gap didn't close. A couple more went by, 
same thing. We're still waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 So are a few hundred others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crowded out: Playing in the same threesome with Woods in the final round was 
Don Baker of Canoga Park, who said he felt like excess baggage at times and was 
a little overwhelmed by the considerable gallery of approximately 200 that 
followed Woods' every move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I'd be nervous," said Baker, who played on the PGA Tour in 
1977-78 before regaining his amateur status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really nervous, but I couldn't relax, either. I haven't played in 
front of a gallery forever." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Baker said he had trouble making his way through the throng in his 
electric cart. There were no gallery ropes, so the crowd wandered around with 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get to see him play much," Baker cracked. "There were too many 
people in the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker shot 74, which left him in a two-way tie for fourth place and gave him 
his second consecutive top-10 finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fast facts: Woods' play on the par-five seventh hole epitomized his 
record-breaking effort in the SCGA at Hacienda Golf Club. Saturday, he holed a 
sand shot from a green-side bunker for an eagle. Sunday, he made a twisting 
35-foot putt from the fringe for an eagle. Two eagles in as many days on the 
same hole -- all without so much as being on the green. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg and Mike Turner of Sherman Oaks have accepted invitations to play in 
the 28th Pacific Coast Amateur, which begins Tuesday at the Jack 
Nicklaus-designed Bear Creek Golf Club in Murrieta, Calif. The tournament 
features players from California, Utah, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Nevada, 
Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and British Columbia. This year marks only 
the sixth time it has been held in the Southland. It is a 72-hole, stroke-play 
event. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ladin of Westlake Village, who at age 61 was the oldest player in the 
SCGA field, finished with a final-round 72 that left him tied for 36th at 303. 
Ladin, the 1993 State Senior Amateur champion, next will play in the British 
Senior Amateur Championship Aug. 3-5 in Manchester, England. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of San Fernando Valley products had their SCGA records obliterated by 
Woods' scintillating effort Saturday. Woods' third-round score of 62 shattered 
the competitive course record of 66 at Hacienda set by Dave Olsen of Toluca 
Lake in 1992 and also broke the SCGA single-round mark of 64 set by former Taft 
High standout Duffy Waldorf at Stockdale Country Club in Bakersfield in 1982. 
Waldorf, who lives in Valencia, plays on the PGA Tour. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The SCGA will be played next summer at the Santa Ana Country Club, a par-72 
layout that measures 6,543 yards from the championship tees. Like Hacienda, 
built in 1919-20, Santa Ana is one of the older courses in the Southland. It 
was built in 1929. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Emilee Klein of Studio City finished with an 11-over 82 in the final round of 
the U.S. Women's Open at Lake Orion, Mich., but was still the second-lowest 
amateur in the field with a 72-hole total of 295. Carol Semple Thompson of 
Sewickley, Pa., was low amateur at 291. This weekend, Klein is playing for the 
United States against Great Britain in the biennial Curtis Cup competition in 
Chattanooga, Tenn.

NEW LAKER BURYING THE HATCHET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Lakers' introduction of first-round draft choice Eddie Jones, signed 
Tuesday to a six-year contract worth $13.5 million, Jones was asked if he held 
any grudge against former college opponent and new Laker teammate Nick Van 
Exel. 
</P>
<P>
 The two squared off when Jones was at Temple, Van Exel at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no, he's my teammate now," said Jones, Atlantic 10 player of the year as 
a senior. "I've got to love him. I'm going to be encouraging him to take more 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Vice President Jerry West interrupted to say: "You better hope he passes 
more. You're the one who is supposed to be the shooter." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a quick exchange, but could be indicative of the Lakers' plan for the 
6-foot-6, 190-pound shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyebrows were raised when the Lakers, already deep with shooting guards, 
drafted Jones 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Christie, Sedale Threatt, Anthony Peeler and Tony Smith have started at 
that position in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to play," West said. "There was not a better athlete in the 
draft." 
</P>
<P>
 According to West, the Lakers will continue to listen to trade offers for any 
of their guards. His confidence in Jones came in response to doubts, expressed 
Tuesday by Jones himself, that the guard can readily adjust to the NBA's 
man-to-man defense after playing in the regimented zone defense of Temple Coach 
John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something I have to work on," Jones said. "Temple had a great system 
and I enjoyed it, but we played mostly zone with Coach Chaney. Well, 100% 
zone." 
</P>
<P>
 "They play a matchup zone," West said. "We actually think his defense is one 
of his pluses." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he is working with weights to reach a playing weight close to 200. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm strong for my size," he added. "(The Atlantic 10) is a physical league. 
You get scratched and pushed and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' contract is for slightly less than previously reported.

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; DESPERATE REDFERN FOUND FAST RELIEF 
FROM PERSUASIVE INFIELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six games in six days can deplete a pitching staff. Or, as was the case with 
Valley North, it can expand a staff, too. 
</P>
<P>
 With last week's District 20 playoffs requiring Pete Redfern to wring every 
possible inning from his pitchers, the Valley North coach looked to Danny 
Martin. Martin was a utility infielder who offered his pitching services to 
Redfern in the past -- in American Legion play and at Chatsworth High -- but 
Redfern never took him up on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent him down to get loose one day and I watched him and he looked like he 
was throwing good, so I said, 'What the heck. Give it a shot,' " said Redfern, 
a former major league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, a recent graduate of Chatsworth, made his first pitching appearance, 
in Legion or at Chatsworth, on Thursday against Sun Valley. He pitched 2 2/3 
scoreless innings and picked up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks like he's got a heck of a hook," said Redfern, referring to Martin's 
curveball. "I don't know what he was throwing out there, but he did a heck of a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin pitched each of the next two days. He finished the playoffs with a 2-0 
record. He allowed one run in nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like I found a relief pitcher," Redfern said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On to Area 6: The six teams that will compete for the Area 6 championship this 
week at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium are set. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, which includes players from Camarillo, Moorpark and Rio Mesa highs, 
will face St. Bernard, from Playa del Rey, in the first game Thursday at 10 
a.m. Valley North, of Chatsworth, will face Arcadia at 2 p.m., and 
Westlake-Royal will meet Westchester at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The double-elimination tournament concludes Sunday, with the winner advancing 
to the Southern California finals in Upland. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, incidentally, is the same team that has been called Rio Mesa, but 
Coach Ron Regalado prefers the name Camarillo because that's where the Legion 
post that sponsors the team is located. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who's on first?: During the playoffs, Van Nuys East's Justin Bunch was thrown 
out stealing first base. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bunch at first, another runner at third and Rich Igou at the plate, Bunch 
took off on a hit-and-run play. Igou tipped the pitch, but it went straight 
into the catcher's glove. The umpire signaled foul-tip, but said the runner 
could advance because the ball was caught. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent misunderstanding, Bunch trotted back toward first base. 
Woodland Hills West pitcher Justin Balser alertly threw to first baseman Craig 
Carlton, who tagged Bunch for what would have been the first out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the home-plate umpire then awarded Bunch second base, explaining that he 
was deceived by the foul-tip signal. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 10-minute argument, Igou hit a three-run home run on the next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's back: Actually, Area 6 Commissioner Charlie Hatfield never went away. 
</P>
<P>
 He planned to retire his position at the end of the year because he wanted to 
return to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to (retire), but I got a call last week that said, 'Guess what? 
You've been nominated (to be commissioner) for three more years,' " Hatfield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatfield can reject the nomination, but figures to take it and leave the 
coaching to others. "I'm 73 years old," he said. "I'm getting too old to handle 
these kids anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger they are . . .: Antelope Valley South started the District 20 
playoffs as the top-seeded team. Two games later, South was the top-seeded team 
whose season was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very disappointed," Coach Mike Eberhardt said. "I think our biggest 
problem was we got to where we were with our hitting and in that last game, it 
just never made it to the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley South hit six home runs during its 13-12, 12-inning defeat to 
Woodland Hills West on Wednesday, but managed only three hits in a 4-1 setback 
to Encino Thursday that knocked the team from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 South played until 10 the night before against Woodland Hills West, and with 
the drive back to Lancaster, most players didn't get home until midnight, 
Eberhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not using that for an excuse, though," Eberhardt said. "Encino is a 
good team and their pitching did quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All-Stars: The fifth annual North-South All-Star game will be played Tuesday 
at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. The game matches players from the northern 
and southern halves of Southern California. The dividing line cuts through the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Local players selected to the game include Van Nuys South's Aaron Amitin, 
North Hollywood's Tyler Atwood, Woodland Hills West's Justin Balser, Antelope 
Valley South's Eric Cole and Chris Tapia, Newhall-Santa Clarita's Aaron Dean 
and Lucas Solomon, Westlake-Royal's Phil Derryman, Valley North's Jim DeBiase, 
Encino's Brad Farlow, Verdugo Hills' David Gantt, Camarillo A's Nathan Kaup, 
Granada Hills West's Jim Landress, Camarillo B's Mike Muller, Palmdale's Chris 
Paxton, Mission Hills' Jon Tucker and Newbury Oaks' Andy Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tourney tidbits: Woodland Hills West's Billy Burnette had a streak of four 
consecutive games in which he homered. Burnette's streak was stopped by Van 
Nuys East on Thursday at Burroughs High. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North's Tony Montiel missed hitting the cycle by a triple in successive 
games on Thursday and Friday. But Montiel would have been hard pressed to get a 
triple at Burroughs, where both games were played, because the fence is only 
325 feet from home plate at its farthest point. "This place is too small to get 
a triple," Montiel said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North's Bryan LaCour was safe on a straight steal of home on Saturday 
against Encino. Valley North's Brian Wittman stole home later in the game on 
the front end of a delayed double-steal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour was denied the chance to be a hero when Sun Valley's Hugo De La Torre 
threw a bases-loaded wild pitch with LaCour at the plate, allowing the winning 
run to score in the championship game Sunday. "We won the game," LaCour said, 
"but I wanted to do something, just hit the ball somewhere. Even a cheesy fly 
ball." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Redfern said he will continue to coach Legion next summer, even though he will 
be pitching coach at The Master's College, not Chatsworth High, next spring. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Dongo, center fielder for Van Nuys East, turned in one of the 
tournament's best plays when he nailed Valley North's Wittman at the plate with 
a throw that never touched the ground. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, Van Nuys East made 14 errors in its last two games.

 Sandi Burns keeps a wallet-size photo of a young, dark-haired woman holding 
two children in tattoo-covered arms as a reminder of someone many people want 
to forget. She is Rosie Alfaro, the first and only woman in Orange County to be 
sentenced to death, and she is Burns' friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns befriends people others often shun or despise, people who may have 
committed heinous crimes. Burns is coordinator of Friends Outside, a program 
that assists the incarcerated and their families. Offered through the St. 
Vincent de Paul Center for Community Reconciliation in Orange, the program 
matches prisoners with people willing to correspond with the incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I came to know Rosie," Burns says. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing a friendship with the incarcerated, especially someone who has 
committed an especially violent act, requires an understanding of the reasons 
that led them to commit the crime in the first place, says Gregorio Martinez, 
chaplain of Orange County jails for the St. Vincent de Paul center. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to really listen to their story to see why the incarcerated did the 
wrongdoing. You have to see what the situation was," Martinez says. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding what social factors -- poverty, drug problems, broken homes -- 
contributed to the prisoner's situation can also foster the "reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been involved in the ministry 10 years," Martinez says. "Whatever crime 
(the prisoners) have committed, we are there to bring compassion. Every time I 
see some man or woman in jail, I think, 'What would I do if that were my own 
mother, my own father, my own daughter?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Friends Outside was founded in Santa Clara County in 1954 by Rosemary 
Goodenough, who was encouraged by the county sheriff to discover problems 
facing the families of inmates. Goodenough found the families were under 
extreme stress and financial worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends Outside, which has chapters throughout California, was formed to help 
the families cope. The Orange County chapter began in 1978 to provide services 
to ex-offenders and their families, including jail visits and correspondence 
with prisoners, holiday events for families, job referrals and an upcoming 
parenting class. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns corresponds with Alfaro and three other prisoners through Friends 
Outside. Additional volunteers correspond with 250 inmates a month, but more 
volunteers are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the inmates are just really lonely. They have no one on the outside," 
Burns says. "We are their source of communication with the outside world." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Maria (Rosie) del Rosio Alfaro, 22, was sentenced to death two years ago for 
fatally stabbing a 9-year-old Anaheim girl, Autumn Wallace. Alfaro has said 
that she was high on drugs at the time of the murder. After stabbing the girl 
57 times and leaving her to bleed to death on her bathroom floor, Alfaro looted 
the Wallace house of electrical equipment and clothes and sold the goods for 
about $300. Judge Theodore Millard, who presided over the case, called the 
murder the most "senseless, brutal, vicious and callous" killing he had ever 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of four young boys, Alfaro is now living with two other women on 
California's Death Row, at the Central California Women's Facility in 
Chowchilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Many may wonder how Burns can be friends with someone who committed such a 
terrible act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to judge. I'm here to be her friend," Burns says. "To people who 
ask, 'How can you be friends with her?' I say, 'She was a youngster. She's only 
22 now. She was in the middle of an addiction, a disease.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' first contact with Alfaro occurred shortly before Christmas. Alfaro had 
heard from chaplain Martinez about a Christmas party offered by Friends Outside 
for children of the incarcerated. He encouraged Alfaro to fill out a form so 
her children could attend the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rosie asked if I could help her family. That was the onset of our 
friendship," says Burns, who received Alfaro's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote a letter back right away saying, 'Don't worry about anything. Your 
kids will be provided for.' She wrote back and asked if I would have my picture 
taken with her mom and kids (at the party). It was real overwhelming when I met 
her children. I felt so sad. They're beautiful," Burns says. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the two were writing regularly. They've exchanged photographs, and Alfaro 
occasionally calls Burns collect from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Late at night I'll get on my computer and write to her," Burns says. "We 
share a lot of what's happening in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, 39, can relate to Alfaro in a way that many cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already had a common bond. I'm a recovering addict myself," Burns says. "I 
had a husband, children, a beautiful home in the hills and my own business (a 
hair salon). I lost all that. It was a very dark time. Today I have a real good 
relationship with my children and my ex-husband. I have a real inner peace and 
serenity." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns began her recovery from addiction to drugs and alcohol more than four 
years ago, and she can empathize with the withdrawal pains that Alfaro is 
experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's mentioned cravings coming and going. I totally relate to that." 
</P>
<P>
 For Alfaro, the phone calls and letters to Burns are one of her few links to 
the outside. (Alfaro could not be interviewed for this story.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I never get a letter or a phone call where she doesn't ask about her mom. She 
asks me to see if her mom's OK," Burns says, who regularly checks up on 
Alfaro's family. 
</P>
<P>
 The two share the news of the day. Alfaro spends her time exercising, reading 
and listening to music. 
</P>
<P>
 "She sends me beautiful art work, and we've sent her drawing material, 
clothing and snacks." Alfaro is allowed one box of gifts quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns and Alfaro met for the first time earlier this month and spent six hours 
together. Burns had arranged the meeting through the prison, and the two met in 
an attorney's bonds room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about drugs, about her life in prison on Death Row, about where 
she's at," Burns says. "It was strange -- we'd go in and out of laughing and 
almost forgetting where we were, and then we were serious again." 
</P>
<P>
 They spent the rest of the time eating lunch, playing cards and having their 
pictures taken together. Burns is planning another visit next month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first, says Burns, "Rosie was afraid I'd be afraid to visit, maybe 
(because) I haven't been in prison or jail. But I go into jails all the time. I 
deal with a lot of inmates who are a lot more dangerous than Rosie." 
</P>
<P>
 From the letters and phone calls, Burns has a grim picture of what life is 
like for Alfaro. 
</P>
<P>
 When Burns saw a photograph of Alfaro's cell, "It took me a few days to 
recover," she says. "All of Death Row is caged, and she is in a tiny cell. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has good days and bad days. There's a lot of struggle inside her -- being 
where she's at and having kids out here, being remorseful and hating what she's 
done. At the same time, she's taking steps to forgive herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro has expressed interest in corresponding with young gang members to 
discourage them from using drugs. She wrote a poem, published recently in the 
St. Vincent de Paul Center's newsletter, warning about the dangers of drug use: 
</P>
<P>
 . . . never would I of thought/I'd stoop so low,/just for another blow . . . 
/But here I sit today,/doing the same thing each/and everyday./Wondering and 
thinking of all the/should of's and/could of's and/would of's./But it's too 
late./To pull out that June date.  
</P>
<P>
 Since becoming friends with Alfaro, Burns has found she has a greater 
appreciation for her own drug-free existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's made me aware of how grateful I am that I'm out here. I'm where I'm 
supposed to be, assisting people who have the disease I have, looking for the 
good. I believe there's good in everyone. It's just sometimes harder to find in 
some people."

A MIGHTY POWERFUL RANGER CALL; MORE THAN 1,000 QUICK-WITH-A-KICK HOPEFULS TURN 
OUT FOR A BRIEF AUDITION IN BURBANKFOR FOX'S TOP-RATED CHILDREN'S SHOW. 
SUPER-HERO WANNA-BES WHO CAN HIP-HOP MAY HAVE AN EDGE.

<P>
 It wasn't your usual casting call. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, producers of the TV show "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" 
advertised an open call for new Ranger candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, at a dinky Burbank office building on Magnolia Avenue, more than 1,000 
people and a mob of TV cameras showed up. Among them, crews from E!, CNN and 
every local affiliate, although some were looking a little lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are the Power Rangers anyway?" asked someone from the KCBS crew. 
</P>
<P>
 That guy's been watching too much Action News to not recognize the stars of 
the highest-rated children's show in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In each episode, the Power Rangers "morph out" to save Earth from Rita 
Repulsa, the Empress of Evil, by using the Coins of Power to transform 
themselves from ordinary teen-agers into a band of super-heroes. The Fox-TV 
program appears daily at 5 p.m. and for the next two Fridays in prime time at 8 
p.m. The Rangers likenesses are also featured on hot-selling action figures, 
trading cards and, of course, pogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a far cry from President's Day, when the Power Rangers' appearance at 
Universal Studios drew an estimated 35,000 kids and clogged freeways for eight 
miles, Monday's casting call still managed to cause a minor traffic jam and 
earned the concern of Burbank police. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, casting director Katy Wallin had seen about 800 people, 
turning away more than 200. While Saban Entertainment, the producers of the 
phenomenally popular show, were keeping quiet as to how many pairs of Power 
Ranger boots they were actually looking to fill, rumors flew that some -- if 
not all -- of the six original Power Rangers will not return next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our audience will learn how this search for new talent will affect the show 
in the coming months," was all Saban spokesman Elie Dekel would say. "It's part 
of our effort to keep the show exciting and fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Saban had requested applicants appearing between ages 15-18 and possessing 
intermediate to advanced martial arts and/or gymnastics skills and/or hip-hop 
dancing abilities. All ethnic types, the ads said, were encouraged to apply to 
the non-union show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 6 a.m. Monday, the line had begun to form, headed by 23-year-old dancer 
Kimberly Jordan. Like a lot of would-be Rangers in their 20s (or even 30s), 
Jordan was hoping that she looked 18 or younger. She had camped out early in 
order "to beat the crowd."  
</P>
<P>
 By 2 p.m., it appeared that Jordan had made the right move: More than 250 
aspiring Power Rangers had registered for individual auditions, each armed with 
a prepared one-minute routine. Dozens of others were lined up across the baking 
heat of the black-top parking lot, down the sidewalk and around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wore white judo outfits, proudly displaying their brown and black belts, 
while others wore sweats, bike shorts or even just jeans and a T-shirt. Two 
little girls came dressed as Power Rangers. They stretched into splits, did 
handstands, kicked and leaped high into the air, and even practiced their 
hip-hop routines for their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the air-conditioned casting office, Wallin announced the audition rules 
to the first 15 applicants: "Focus on the camera, and remember the room is 
small. No kicking walls. And I'm not interested in seeing weapons. Does anyone 
have weapons? Good, then let's get going." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Moran, 15, was one of the first to audition, making the trip with his 
mother from the Northern California town of Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran practices a form of kick-boxing known as Muay Thai and heard about the 
casting call through his agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Once his name was called, Moran entered the audition room, took off his 
T-shirt, gave his name and age directly into the camera and began his routine, 
slowly kicking and thrusting his fists into the air.  
</P>
<P>
 "Cut!" said Wallin smiling, after about 30 seconds. "That was good. Do you 
know how to hip-hop dance?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," answered Moran, retrieving his T-shirt, "I can dance." 
</P>
<P>
 "Great, thanks for coming. Make sure you fill out an information sheet. Are 
you emancipated?" Wallin asked, making sure that Moran had parental approval to 
work. When Moran nodded, Wallin opened the door, and shouted, "Next!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the now-crowded waiting room, Moran's fellow auditioners accosted him with 
a chorus of "How was it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked me if I was emancipated," Moran told the crowd, intent on learning 
from his mistakes. "I didn't know what she meant, so I said, 'Yeah.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the logistic complications of the open call began to mount. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants with the bad luck of sharing the building with a casting agency 
complained of a mess in the bathroom and that they couldn't get to their 
parking spaces.  
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the TV crews were in full force. It didn't take long for those 
standing in line to deduce that their chance at fame might not lie inside the 
building. Their best shot might be one of those people loitering on the corner 
hoisting a minicam.  
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want her to tumble?" one father asked a nearby cameraman, referring to 
his 10-year-old leotard-clad daughter. "She can tumble. Honey, tumble for the 
man!" 
</P>
<P>
 And predictably, as the heat rose, so did the weirdness quotient. 
</P>
<P>
 April Quaker, 25, who accompanied a friend but wasn't auditioning because "I 
don't think I'm violent enough," said that one guy in particular made her a tad 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was twitching and kicking all over the place," she said, "and I'm like, 
'Please, let your inner child out!' "

GIFT OF WEALTH AND PASSION; ART: LACMA'S 'NEW ACQUISITIONS' EXHIBITION HONORS 
ROBERT H. HALFF FOR HIS DONATION OF 40 WORKS FROM HIS PERSONAL COLLECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "The main thing is that collecting art has enriched my life enormously," says 
Robert H. Halff as he surveys 11 of his favorite possessions at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The small exhibition -- installed over the weekend in honor of Halff's 
promised gift of 40 works from his collection -- boasts a classic Joan Miro 
canvas, an early (1955) Jasper Johns painting, vintage works on paper by Sam 
Francis, Cy Twombly and Robert Motherwell, and a striking array of Pop art 
icons, including Andy Warhol's signature "Campbell's Soup Can" painting, Claes 
Oldenburg's oversize sculpture of a lumpy baked potato and Roy Lichtenstein's 
comic-book-style image "Cold Shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Buying works such as these fresh out of studios and galleries, living with 
adventurous art and being part of an elite collectors community that has access 
to private treasure troves has been his great privilege for the past 30 years, 
according to the 85-year-old retired screenwriter and advertising executive. 
But now he has decided to share his riches with the museum he has supported for 
three decades and served as a trustee since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things the museum should have bought, but didn't have the foresight 
or the money to buy," Halff says of his gift. "They will fill in a lot of 
gaps." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Barron, LACMA's curator of 20th-Century art and coordinator of 
curatorial affairs, emphatically agrees. "We have multiples by Jasper Johns, 
but 'Number 7' is our first unique Johns piece. It's a classic work from the 
'50s and something that has always been on our wish list," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Donated paintings by Miro, Warhol and Frank Stella and the Oldenburg sculpture 
complement the artists' other works in the collection, she says. Furthermore, 
Halff's gift provides LACMA with its first drawings by Oldenburg and Twombly, 
and its first and only Motherwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Bob decided to make his gift, he devoted a great deal of care and 
attention to what we have and don't have," Barron says. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum hails the windfall as its most significant gift of contemporary art 
in 20 years. "Bob has given us major works of art that would be unattainable 
any other way," Barron says. "This is how museums are built -- by passionate 
collectors. And we all benefit from it. If we don't have the cooperation of 
real collectors, it will be very hard for museums to reflect not only the art 
of our time but the collecting patterns of our time." 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of a collecting family, Halff says he acquired his tastes quite 
naturally. A graduate of the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the 
University of Pennsylvania, he settled in Los Angeles in 1942 and worked as a 
screenwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He also moved up through the ranks of the 
advertising industry, eventually serving as creative director for New York and 
Los Angeles agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, his collection of contemporary paintings, drawings and 
sculptures grew until it filled his home in Beverly Hills. Some of the walls 
are bare now, but Halff appears to have no regrets. "I'm just so pleased that I 
got involved with art and had the opportunity to live with it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * "New Acquisitions," a selection of promised gifts from the Robert H. Halff 
collection, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire Blvd., (213) 
857-6000. Wed. and Thurs., 10 a.m.-5 p.m.; Fri., 10 a.m.-9 p.m.; Sat. and Sun., 
11 a.m.-6 p.m. Adults $6; students and seniors $4, children 5 and under free.

HOLLYWOOD HABITS; FOLLOWING THE SCRIPT OF A HIGH-STAKES MOVIE BIDDING WAR; NEW 
LINE CINEMA BUYS SHANE BLACK'S LATEST SCREENPLAY FOR A RECORD $4 MILLION. 
HERE'S HOW THE DEAL WAS DONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The dog days of summer were fast approaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the season's big movies, including "True Lies" and "Forrest Gump," 
were already out of the box. Within the next few weeks, the Hollywood exodus 
would begin. All the players would be high-tailing it to the Hamptons, the 
south of France or their hideaways in the Malibu Colony. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was still a major piece of business yet to be done before the summer 
slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Black, one of the town's hottest young screenwriters and creator of the 
highly profitable "Lethal Weapon" series, had just completed his latest "spec 
script" -- a screenplay that's auctioned on the open market and sold to the 
highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Black's agent, David Greenblatt at ICM, was fairly confident his client's 
latest work, "The Long Kiss Goodnight," about a housewife who emerges from 
amnesia to discover she was once an assassin hired by the U.S. government, 
would bring top dollar. The writer's previous script, "The Last Boy Scout," 
sold for $1.75 million and his latest was in the same action genre. Black also 
wrote the first draft of "Lethal Weapon 2" and last year's much less successful 
"Last Action Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 What neither Greenblatt nor Black could anticipate, however, was just how much 
money "Long Kiss" would sell for -- and to whom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outbidding Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros., New Line Cinema -- which before 
its recent purchase by media mogul Ted Turner built its name on such low-budget 
independent movies as "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and "Nightmare on Elm 
Street" -- agreed to pay a record $4 million for the script. That fee, of which 
the writer receives $3.5 million immediately and a $500,000 producer's fee when 
the movie rolls, surpasses the $3-million upfront money ICM client Joe 
Eszterhas received in 1990 for his spec "Basic Instinct."  
</P>
<P>
 While Greenblatt and his ICM colleagues, including Tom Strickler who helped 
negotiate the deal, refused to be interviewed, New Line executives and others 
close to the auction helped reconstruct the details of a singular but classic 
Hollywood high-stakes bidding war driven not only by the movie material itself 
but by egos, competitiveness and ultimately, the biggest weapon of all -- 
money. The time: About 5 p.m. Monday, July 18. The place: ICM's starkly stylish 
Wilshire Boulevard offices in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Black's agents send his script out to potential buyers. The writer had given 
ICM a wish list of producers with whom he most wanted to work: James L. Brooks, 
James Cameron, Joel Silver, Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and the husband-wife 
team of Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. By Monday evening, calls begin 
coming in from interested parties.  
</P>
<P>
 Silver, who has a deal at Warner Bros., and executives at Columbia, where 
Brooks is based, call Tuesday morning; others on Black's wish list pass. Later 
that day, Black is sent by his agents to take "creative meetings" with Brooks 
and Silver at their respective offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, New Line President Michael De Luca and executive Vice President 
Richard Saperstein, who had slipped the script to director Renny Harlin 
("Cliffhanger") and his actress-wife Geena Davis on Monday night, call ICM late 
Tuesday afternoon and make the first offer: $1.75 million, including a 
guaranteed $250,000 producer's fee. To underscore the seriousness of their 
interest, New Line executives promise that "Last Kiss" would be an automatic 
"go" movie with Harlin directing and Davis starring. Steve Tisch, who has a 
deal at New Line, is also on board as one of the producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenblatt and Strickler respond coolly to the bid, telling them that they are 
entertaining other offers. ICM figures it at least has Silver, to whom Black 
feels deep loyalty, in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Line executives are nervous when they learn that Black really clicked with 
Brooks, whom he thought could mentor him on the script. "Jim Brooks is my 
favorite filmmaker.... and he is great with character development," Black told 
The Times last week after the sale.  
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of Tuesday we heard the Jim Brooks situation was percolating at 
Columbia," De Luca said. "So our next step was to put Renny and Geena together 
with Shane. Richard (Saperstein) and I met with Black at 2 p.m. (Tuesday) and 
that night we put them all together." 
</P>
<P>
 De Luca says Black came away from that meeting feeling that "Renny and Geena 
were the right creative combination" for him. "Then it became a matter of who 
was going to secure the script for them." New Line had made a recent overall 
deal with the pair but since they were not exclusive to the company, all other 
parties would be free to bid on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, New Line ups its offer to $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Warners and Columbia match it. But just before ICM calls it a 
night around 8, New Line increases its offer to $2.7 million to make sure it 
has the edge going into Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Black's agents tell him Thursday it is time to enter formal negotiations to 
secure a deal by day's end. The writer is also advised to decide whom he feels 
most comfortable with creatively. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, said Saperstein, "We were told (by ICM) it was leaning toward 
Columbia because Shane wanted to work with Jim Brooks. So, we just kept Renny 
talking to Shane. We knew our advantage was we already had a director and 
star." 
</P>
<P>
 About 2:30 Thursday, Black, who left ICM around noon "because I didn't want to 
hang around the deal anymore," tells his agents to begin negotiating with New 
Line. His attorney, Alan Hergott, is called and a meeting is set at ICM for 4 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 What ensues is a 4 1/2-hour marathon negotiating session. From home, Black 
calls every 20 or 30 minutes for an update. "Then I'd go eat or read detective 
novels -- that's what I do when deals are being done." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the conference room are Hergott, Greenblatt and Strickler and New 
Line's De Luca, Saperstein and senior vice president of business affairs 
Margaret Blatner. Michael Lynne, president of New Line's parent company, is 
conferenced in by phone from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. 
He is on his way to Russia to attend a Turner board meeting with New Line 
founder and chairman Robert (Bob) Shaye. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations begin in earnest when Black's agents say their client will sell 
his script to them for a guaranteed $3.5 million. New Line mulls over the 
proposal and agrees to the money, but there is a big problem. Harlin and Davis 
cannot commit to "Kiss" as their next film because they are already obligated 
to make the pirate movie "Cutthroat Island" for Carolco Pictures. Harlin has 
been under the gun to replace Michael Douglas, who bowed out of the project two 
weeks ago, with an actor of equal marquee value here and overseas, so that 
production can begin in the fall. Black's agents tell New Line their client has 
a problem with his movie following "Cutthroat," so they are dubious a deal can 
be made. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 p.m., Greenblatt and Strickler go into the office of ICM chairman Jeff 
Berg, who immediately places a call to Mark Canton, chairman of 
Columbia/TriStar Motion Picture Companies. Meanwhile, De Luca and Saperstein 
are working it hard from the conference room, keeping Harlin on the phone with 
Black. "ICM started to get pressure from the other buyers to make a decision 
and all indications were that Columbia was going to step up (to match New 
Line's $3.5-million bid) and the rumor was that they agreed to do the movie 
with Renny and Geena," said De Luca. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia supposedly never went that high. "It was more than $3 million but 
less than $3.5 million," said a Columbia source. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver keeps calling to check in from Chicago, where he's shooting "Richie 
Rich," but Warners never raises its bid. 
</P>
<P>
 So Black has to decide whether it is worth taking $500,000 less up front from 
Columbia because he wants to work with Brooks, or whether he should go with New 
Line, which is offering a go movie and a higher percentage of box-office 
profits. Columbia says its offer is firm. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:45, ICM tells New Line executives it has a very handsome offer from 
Columbia that Black is inclined to take unless they can reassure its client's 
concerns about the "Cutthroat" glitch. Greenblatt writes the number 4 on a 
piece of paper, circles it, slides it across the table and says that's what it 
would take to make the deal work. He walks out of the room. "We thought the 
deal was going to go away, so we called Bob Shaye in Sweden," said De Luca. "We 
knew we had to extend our offer to get Shane over the downside." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no phone in the chateau where Shaye was staying. And it was 4 a.m. 
in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone had to drive to Bob and wake him up and bring him to a building to 
talk on the phone," said De Luca. Saperstein explains the situation to his 
boss. De Luca said, "Bob's bottom-line decision was based on looking at this 
like he was acquiring a movie, not a script." 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:15, everybody files into the office of ICM President Jim Wiatt for a 
change of scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 New Line agrees to the $4 million. Greenblatt ducks into the hallway and calls 
Black, who instantly accepts the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to terms that it would be Renny and Geena's next movie after 
'Cutthroat,' " said a much-relieved De Luca. In fact, Harlin told the Hollywood 
Reporter earlier this week that he plans to begin pre-production on "Kiss," by 
May, 1995, while still in post-production on "Cutthroat." 
</P>
<P>
 It is 8:30 p.m. when Greenblatt and Strickler look at each other and wonder 
aloud how they could ever hope to top the deal they had just made. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, that's the stuff sequels are made of.

CENSORSHIP ATTACKS CLOUD NEW PBS CHIEF'S MESSAGE; TELEVISION: PRESIDENT ERVIN 
S. DUGGAN DELIVERS AN 'OPTIMISTIC' SPEECH, BUT PROTESTERS ACCUSE THE NETWORK OF 
FAILING TO AIR CONTROVERSIAL PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 PBS President Ervin S. Duggan, making his debut Tuesday before the semi-annual 
gathering of the nation's television writers and critics, said he brought a 
message of "feistiness" and "optimism" about the non-commercial network he has 
headed for nearly six months. But he quickly ran into a barrage of questions 
that seemed to imply PBS was censoring controversial content. 
</P>
<P>
 Duggan, a former Federal Communications Commissioner and a longtime 
inside-the-Beltway official who had been a speech writer in Lyndon Johnson's 
White House, responded that he was "hot under the collar" about charges of 
censorship, that it was "debasing the language" to use that word, and that 
anyone suggesting PBS would delete material because it was controversial is 
"trying to gull you." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Universal City Hilton, a group called Coalition vs. PBS Censorship 
distributed materials attacking PBS for not airing "Defending Our Lives," a 
30-minute film about domestic violence that won this year's Academy Award for 
short documentary, and "The Fire This Time," a film about the 1992 Los Angeles 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Jennifer Lawson, executive vice president for programming, more 
than 100 organizations and individuals asked: "Are battered women only supposed 
to be heard in sound bites edited by others? Is it a violation of your 
guidelines for them to participate in shaping the debate?" Among the signers 
were 28 statewide coalitions on domestic violence, including the Los Angles 
Committee on Assaults Against Women; State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica); 
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick and actor Alec Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Duggan indicated that the domestic violence film violated "editorial 
guidelines" because the material was prepared by groups involved in the issue 
of battered women. As for the riot film, Duggan said similar material was 
covered on PBS by "Frontline." 
</P>
<P>
 When producer Randy Holland, who attended the press conference, said his riot 
documentary covered areas that had not been dealt with, including FBI and Los 
Angeles Police Department attacks on community groups such as Watts Writers 
Workshop and the Black Panthers, Duggan asserted PBS' own First Amendment right 
to make "editorial decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite "pressure from the resolute right and the coercive left, we are a 
resolute cool little network," Duggan said, adding: "We live at ground zero in 
the nuclear attacks that occur in the cultural wars." 
</P>
<P>
 The most persistent questioning centered on PBS' declining to fund a sequel 
for Armisted Maupin's Emmy-nominated series, "Tales of the City." Duggan said 
it was all "economics," noting that the original "Tales" cost PBS between 
$150,000 and $200,000 and that a sequel was going to be 10 times that. 
</P>
<P>
 Duggan also noted that he was "troubled" by the future of American drama on 
public television because it is expensive but he said that he would take a 
"pro-active role" on behalf of PBS stations in seeking funding from 
corporations. He said he would like to bring Hallmark Hall of Fame productions 
such as "Miss Rose White" to PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 As for public affairs programming, a linchpin in PBS' lineup, Duggan revealed 
that former Ronald Reagan speech writer Peggy Noonan would have her own series. 
</P>
<P>
 So intense was the confrontation between Duggan and the press that the 
session, which was to have lasted 45 minutes, took an hour and 40 minutes. 
Still, Duggan kept his sense of humor. Referring to the vast financial 
resources of Turner Broadcasting System, he noted, "And he (Ted Turner) has 
Jane Fonda."

 FROM THE CHIEF: Firefighters do more than just put out fires, a dozen chiefs 
on hand at Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting could tell you. The 
supervisors were thanking all the county's fire agencies for their efforts in 
last fall's firestorms. . . . Clinton Arnett, vice president of the Orange 
County Fire Chiefs Assn., told the board: "One of our main jobs is prevention, 
not just reaction. Until we can convince all the residents of the danger of 
fire, we will always run the risk of fire." 
</P>
<P>
 LEISURE TALK: Two fires in the last three years at the Seal Beach Pier have 
left the city with a $200,000 bill. Mayor George Brown has his own technique 
for trying to whittle that down. He's seeking pier donations on his own from 
corporations -- and from his neighbors in Leisure World. . . . He passes the 
hat each time he speaks before one of the retirement community clubs and has 
already collected $500. Says Brown: "I wish I had more clubs to talk with."

 KANG SALMON: If you're watching the two-hour Morning News on KTLA (Channel 5) 
today, it could make you hungry. Michael Kang, owner of Five Feet Restaurant in 
Laguna Beach, will be fixing the news anchors an on-air breakfast of poached 
salmon with his own "strawberry black pepper relish." . . . The show is touting 
Kang's talents because he recently won regional competition for Gourmet 
magazine's Healthy Menu Award. His dish for the Gourmet judges: "Salmon fuji

 MICKEY WHO? Famous as he is, Mickey Mouse may not be the greatest Mickey of 
all. On Saturday, Mickey Mouse meets Mickey Mantle. . . . Most people go to 
Disneyland with their wallets a little fatter than usual. But if you'd like a 
souvenir from the baseball legend, you might want to stop at the bank on your 
way. Mantle will autograph jerseys to sell for $700, caps for $405, and bats 
for $1,750. You can wave to him in the parade for free.

PLANES AT 3 AIRPORTS CAN LAND WITH SATELLITE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first three airport approaches using the global positioning system have 
been issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA announced Tuesday that it has released the approaches for airports in 
Frederick, Md.; Oshkosh, Wis., and Denton, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 When the government develops a GPS approach at an airport, pilots can obtain a 
computer chip for their GPS receiver, which then will guide them into a landing 
at that airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite-based navigation system will permit pilots to land without 
needing any ground-based guidance, such as the radio direction systems widely 
used by many airports. Providing the approaches eliminates the need for ground 
equipment that can be costly and needs regular servicing. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials plan to issue between 500 and 1,000 new GPS approaches annually.

HANS J. SALTER; EX-MUSIC CHIEF AT FILM STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hans J. Salter, reigning music director, composer and conductor at Universal 
Studios through four decades, has died at his Studio City home. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokeswoman said the prolific film scorer, who was nominated for four 
Academy Awards, was 98 when he died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter presided over a musical mishmash of the prodigious Universal output, 
starting in 1939. His first feature credit was in 1940 for "The Invisible Man 
Returns." He wrote music for films ranging from Deanna Durbin musicals to Bela 
Lugosi and Boris Karloff horror films to historic melodramas. 
</P>
<P>
 He also scored or wrote music for most of the Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce 
"Sherlock Holmes" serial features and the Bud Abbott and Lou Costello 
knockabout comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter's last picture, "Beau Geste," was a 1966 remake of the Foreign Legion 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1941, he received the first of his Academy Award nominations for film 
scoring on "It Started With Eve," which featured Durbin and Charles Laughton. 
Two years later he was nominated for another Durbin musical, "The Amazing Mrs. 
Holiday," and in 1944 for "Christmas Holiday," again with Durbin and Gene 
Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 His last nomination was for "This Love of Ours," a romantic melodrama starring 
Merle Oberon released in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter, who leaves no immediate survivors, had been retired since the late 
1960s.

WARREN WHITE; GUITAR MAKER, KEY FIGURE IN FOLK MUSIC BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warren White, 58, who died homeless yet only 20 years ago was making guitars 
that continue to sell for $2,000 each. White was credited with providing many 
of the tools for the 1960s folk music revolution, crafting classical and 
flamenco guitars in his shop in San Francisco's bustling North Beach.But as the 
years went by, friends said, alcoholism got the better of White. White, who was 
known for his long blond hair and beard, offbeat clothes and eccentric 
behavior, would work for days on a guitar. But in later years, friends said, 
he'd then smash it in a drunken rage. He spent his final years shuffling 
between the streets of Santa Cruz and San Jose, but stayed in contact with old 
friends. In Los Gatos, Calif., on Wednesday when his sleeping bag caught fire.

EXECUTIVE PICKED AS NEW PRESIDENT OF POLICE PANEL; LAPD: ENRIQUE HERNANDEZ JR., 
HEAD OF AN ALHAMBRA SECURITY COMPANY, BRINGS A REPUTATION AS A STRAIGHTFORWARD 
LEADER AND AN OUTSPOKEN COMMISSIONER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A business executive whose father is a retired police officer was elected 
Tuesday to head the Los Angeles Police Commission, bringing his reputation for 
straight talk and management expertise to the presidency of the civilian board 
that oversees the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Hernandez Jr., president of an Alhambra company that provides security 
and other services to government and business customers, became the second 
Police Commission president to serve as head of the five-member civilian body 
since Mayor Richard Riordan took office in 1993 and replaced the entire 
commission with his own appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his appointment a year ago, Hernandez has played an increasingly 
assertive role on the commission, although much of his work has gone on behind 
the scenes. Hernandez, a graduate of Harvard Law School, is the board's 
designated specialist on officer-involved shootings, a responsibility that 
gives him little public exposure but makes him the point man on sensitive 
issues of officer discipline and training. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also been outspoken about issues of low officer morale and the shoddy 
state of LAPD equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's determination to attack those problems has impressed members of 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams' command staff. Many view him as a 
straightforward leader who is willing to challenge them when he disagrees, 
although Police Department sources also report that relations between Hernandez 
and Williams have not been especially close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this organization, like most others, is successful if the services 
that are provided are good services," Hernandez said in a recent interview. 
"And to have good services there has to be a well-trained and enthusiastic 
police officer who is properly equipped. The morale of the officers is 
critical, the way that we support them both with procedures and training and 
also the tools -- working cars, proper radios." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez takes over the presidency from Rabbi Gary Greenebaum, whose year as 
president began amid public uncertainty about the commission's commitment to 
reform of the Police Department. While at the helm of the commission, 
Greenebaum organized a series of updates on the status of reform, using them as 
a platform to urge the department to press ahead with recommendations made by 
the Christopher Commission regarding the use of force by police officers and 
the need for the LAPD to adopt a more community-oriented style of policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenebaum, who will remain a member of the commission, also played a key role 
in acknowledging the department's problems with sexual harassment and in 
supporting Williams' efforts to tackle the issue. With Greenebaum's support, 
Williams backed a proposal to create a separate unit to investigate sexual 
harassment and discrimination complaints, although the specifics of how that 
unit will operate still are being debated. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, however, the commission also struggled with some issues. 
Its efforts to install a computerized tracking system for officers repeatedly 
ran into snags, and its work to combat sexual harassment has been criticized by 
some as being too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been very serious in moving to deal with the sexual harassment and 
discrimination issues that I've been involved with," said Katherine Spillar, 
president of the Feminist Majority in Los Angeles and a leader of the Women's 
Advisory Council to the Police Commission. "It's not been far enough and not 
fast enough, but there's been progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenebaum agreed that many changes have taken longer than he expected, but he 
praised his fellow commissioners and said he believes the efforts launched by 
the commission during the last year have set the department on the right 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I leave the position optimistic," said Greenebaum as he prepared to step down 
Tuesday. "I think we made some real strides toward reform. . . . And I also 
leave it realistic about how long it takes to reform this department. What I 
thought could be done in a couple years probably can't be done that quickly."

DANA PARSONS: CASTRUITA 'ROAST' TURNS OUT TO BE A WELL-DONE TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As roasts go, it wasn't hilariously funny. Some of the speakers, in fact, 
didn't even try to uphold the sacred tradition of skewering the guest of honor. 
One or two of them even had trouble maintaining composure. 
</P>
<P>
 They came not to bury Rudy, but to praise him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Castruita already has left Santa Ana for his new job as superintendent of 
the San Diego Department of Education, so his "roasting" Monday night in front 
of about 300 people had an even more nostalgic tinge than normal for such 
things. Far from being roasted, he was, if anything, lightly buttered. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there was a fair share of laughs, but you got the feeling that pointed 
humor wasn't the dominant mood only because lots of people in the audience 
wished Castruita weren't leaving. Maybe they were afraid they'd laugh till they 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a touching testimonial, because in many places superintendents come and 
go. The Orange Unified School District churns them out faster than Volkswagens 
in Stuttgart. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita, however, is no ordinary superintendent, because Santa Ana Unified 
is no ordinary school district. Superintendents in Newport-Mesa or Capistrano 
Unified don't have to sell their student body on the importance of staying in 
school. They don't have the pressure of being role models to elementary school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana, with its 95% minority enrollment and with 72% of its students 
having limited English proficiency, provides a unique challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a challenge Castruita, now 50, has embraced since he became 
superintendent 6 1/2 years ago. He's done so at the expense of time with his 
family, a point taken by more than one speaker. It led one to joke that 
Castruita's wife, Jean, considered taking up jogging but because of her 
husband's absences, became a marathoner (which is true). 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, a Castruita bandwagon formed. He was portrayed as the kid from 
the barrio who made good, even after his father abandoned the family and 
Castruita was raised by his grandparents. He's received national acclaim, and 
at one point Gov. Pete Wilson wanted him to consider the vacant state 
superintendent's post, but Castruita wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Basking with 5-0 support from his Santa Ana Board of Education during much of 
his tenure, Castruita has recently been confronted with two dissidents. His 3-2 
majority ensured he could still carry his agenda, but some have speculated the 
narrowing support led to his decision to take the San Diego job. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita was most often lauded Monday night for his educational vision, 
energy, commitment and charisma. The Rev. John McReynolds of Santa Ana's Second 
Baptist Church said, "I know him as a preacher," and jokingly said he had to 
summon all his talents from seminary just to convince audiences that heard the 
two speak jointly "that I was the reverend present." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all speakers let Castruita off the hook. Mike Metzler of the Santa Ana 
Chamber of Commerce chided Castruita for his lack of business acumen: "This is 
a man who thinks an enterprise zone is where Captain Kirk and his crew land." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Audrey Yamagata-Noji drew laughs by telling people that despite 
his reputation for "vision," Castruita can't see. That became obvious every 
time he went to a restaurant, she said. Needing glasses to read a menu but too 
vain to wear them, he always ordered a Cobb salad, she said, because he knew 
every restaurant served one. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if some of the jokes fell flat, the tributes did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young said he admires Castruita as much as anyone 
he's met in public life. "We got a whole bunch of time with you at a time when 
we really needed you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita had been superintendent for three years when I interviewed him in 
his office in June of 1991. At the time, he was taking heat for what some 
critics considered his expansion of school instruction into social services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's talk about basic needs," he said then. "How about breakfast? Food? Hey, 
we can't keep our heads buried in the sand. We have to address the needs of 
kids. If kids are coming to school hungry, then we are going to provide a 
breakfast program. If our kids are coming to school unhealthy, then I'm going 
to do everything in my power to help them. Kids can't learn if they're hungry. 
They can't learn if they're not well. It's all part of the total product that 
we produce in education." 
</P>
<P>
 To the end, he was true to those sentiments. In his brief remarks Monday under 
the night sky, Castruita referred to the "many, many kids out there" who live 
in impoverished families. "Don't ever lose sight of the belief that we must 
educate our youth," he said. "They want to be somebody in life, and they need 
people like you to help them fulfill that dream." 
</P>
<P>

HELEN JOHNSON, UCI EMPLOYEE AND JOURNALIST, DIES AT 71 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Helen Johnson, a longtime Orange County journalist and UC Irvine public 
relations specialist, died Tuesday of cancer. She was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Johnson won the Orange County Press Club's Sky Dunlap Award for 
career excellence and contribution to the community.Johnson worked as a 
reporter for the Orange County Register from 1948, when she came west from her 
native Pennsylvania, until 1953, when she joined the first group of Los Angeles 
Times reporters based in Orange County. At both newspapers she was a general 
assignment reporter but wrote often about education. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was one of the best reporters I worked with for a long time," said former 
Times reporter Don Smith, who also worked with Johnson at the Register. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in 1982, Johnson received UCI's Distinguished Staff member award, the 
highest given to university employees. She directed the university's public 
information office from 1969 until 1983, when she retired.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was from Helen that I learned the importance of substance and accuracy in 
public relations as well as in journalism," said Hilary Kaye, who worked with 
Johnson at UCI. "Those were her watchwords at UCI." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson graduated from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., and earned a 
master's degree in Latin American studies from USC. She traveled frequently and 
often led UCI Extension tours to Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 She also was an active member of First Presbyterian Church in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral arrangements are pending. A memorial service will be announced within 
the next few weeks. Johnson is survived by a brother, Carl Johnson of Lake 
Arrowhead; and a sister, Hilda Holm of Laguna Niguel.

U.S. AND BRITAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Martin Walker is correct when he states that the special relationship 
between the United States and England is dead (Opinion, July 17). But his 
impression that we gave orders to the loyal British is totally false; it was in 
fact the tail that was wagging the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker's belief that the British were used as military cannon fodder is a 
joke. Many a young Americans can testify to serving in postwar Europe to 
forestall a possible Soviet invasion, at a considerable cost to this nation. I 
have recently returned from living in the United Kingdom, and became used to 
the distorted news coverage about America on television nightly. There is anger 
that we are not engaged in the former Yugoslavia, but the real problem is that 
the Europeans cannot decide what to do among themselves. The British 
particularly want to use American "cannon fodder" on a European problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Many British people live in the nostalgic past of British greatness. Those 
days are long gone. The future is in a united Europe, with Germany at its 
center. The British are the main obstacle to a peaceful, united Europe. The 
country is deeply divided on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain is not the quaint country pictured in airline commercials. Britain 
needs to wake up and realize its standing in the world and go from there. But I 
can assure Walker that Britons, not Americans, are to blame.

SEOUL NEEDS TO LIGHTEN UP; TODAY'S SOUTH KOREA SHOULD BE MORE TOLERANT OF 
NONVIOLENT DISSENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a treaty of peace, and for 
more than 40 years a state of belligerence has continued, with South Korea and 
its officials having repeatedly to contend with violent attacks and attempted 
infiltration and subversion from the North. 
</P>
<P>
 In this dangerous climate the Seoul government has insisted on maintaining 
tight restrictions on any unauthorized contacts by its citizens with Pyongyang, 
or on any open expression of sympathy or support for the North Korean regime. 
Honest concerns underlie this policy. But surely the time has come for South 
Korea to re-examine whether such a rigid approach is in fact any longer 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a re-examination is called for not just because of the death earlier this 
month of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founding leader who planned the attack on 
South Korea in 1950. It is called for more urgently because South Korea has 
reached a stage of mature development where its government and people should 
certainly have the self-confidence to become more tolerant of nonviolent 
dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea is one of Asia's great economic and now -- no less heartening -- 
political success stories. Decades of rigged elections, military dictatorships 
and tight curbs on individual rights have given way to a viable multiparty 
democracy, with a freely elected president and the broadest protection of basic 
rights the country has ever known. South Korea, like the United States, of 
course has good reasons to worry about what North Korea may do in the future. 
But that worry shouldn't stand in the way of a more relaxed policy by the South 
Korean government toward domestic dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 This week Seoul revoked the publishing license of one of its non-resident 
citizens, on grounds that he violated the National Security Law by attending 
Kim Il Sung's funeral in Pyongyang. Earlier it moved to punish a handful of 
students who also expressed condolences over Kim's death. Such actions by the 
government suggest an unwarranted timidity and a lack of trust in the good 
sense of the Korean people to act responsibly. It's time for Seoul to recognize 
that nonviolent dissident behavior, by adolescents or adults, is not sedition.

OUCHI WILL NEED THEORY Z-PLUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone want to take a bet on how long the mayor's newly named chief of staff, 
Bill Ouchi, will remain a fresh breeze and a clearheaded voice for 
modernization and reform? 
</P>
<P>
 Any predictions on how long it will before the entrenched interests bare their 
shark's teeth and start chomping away at this respected UCLA professor who is 
also an internationally renowned expert on management? 
</P>
<P>
 And anyone want to wager on how long it will be before some members of the 
City Council, respectful at first, start reacting to everything Ouchi proposes 
as if it was a frontal attack on their individual political fiefdoms? 
</P>
<P>
 Good luck, then, to Mayor Richard Riordan's new staff chief -- Prof. William 
G. Ouchi of the Anderson Graduate School of Management, UCLA, and author of the 
famed book on management: "Theory Z: How American Business Can Meet the 
Japanese Challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 What the city needs, of course, is an Ouchi sequel, something like "Theory 
Z-Plus: How Los Angeles City Government Can Meet the Current Challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 And of course something along these lines is precisely what his boss wants, 
too. He wants a plan to make city government work better. That requires new 
ideas, not tired ones; it requires all parties to work together, not fight one 
another at every turn; it requires imagination, innovation, even sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 At least City Hall now has a catalyst. For with the departure of William R. 
McCarley, a respected insider who is slated to take over the powerful 
Department of Water and Power, Prof. Ouchi now becomes the man on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Can city government reform itself, becoming more responsive, more efficient, 
and more credible? Ouchi is known to believe that many city workers are highly 
skilled, care deeply about their work and can be motivated to new levels of 
performance. He is known to believe that it is the job of their bosses to 
harness that energy and commitment, not snuff it out in a maze of bureaucracy 
and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it too much to ask of all concerned, especially the City Council, to give 
the new chief of staff the benefit of the doubt and work cooperatively with him 
every step of the way? We think not.

TEACH SCIENCE AS SCIENCE; A TEACHER'S LAWSUIT REVISITS THE SCOPES TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Science and religion have their rightful places in a democratic society, but 
there should be no confusion between the two. One of the best-known court 
battles of this century -- the Scopes trial of the 1920s -- saw religious 
fundamentalists try to discredit the scientific theory of evolution. Science 
educators had hoped that the incontrovertible value of teaching evolution 
theory, as developed in Charles Darwin's 1859 "The Origin of Species" and first 
aired in that trial, had been nailed down by several U.S. Supreme Court cases. 
No such luck. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, on technical grounds, 
returned to a lower court for hearing a lawsuit brought by a teacher, John 
Peloza, who insisted on his right to teach creationism to biology students in 
the Capistrano Valley Unified School District. Peloza said the district forced 
him to teach "the religion" of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 HARD TO PROVE: In reinstating the lawsuit, however, the court said that while 
Peloza ought to have a chance to try to prove his point, it would be a hard one 
to prove. In fact, he is on slippery constitutional ground, as previous 
decisions that have explored the First Amendment's establishment clause 
demonstrate. The argument that evolution and creationism should be given equal 
status was rejected flatly in a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court case overruling a 
Louisiana statute that Justice William J. Brennan Jr. said "was (designed) 
clearly to advance the religious viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 DISTURBING CASE: Of course, groups pushing narrow religious agendas will 
always have their occasional successes with pliable legislatures. But the 
Peloza case is especially disturbing because it arises from within the very 
heart of a school system. Here is a public-school science teacher, now 
reassigned to teach health and physical education, who has rejected the premise 
of scientific method. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory of natural selection is not, after all, merely one wild-card idea 
among others competing for acceptance. It is not "just" a theory but a body of 
ideas that have been thoroughly confirmed, derived from solid techniques of 
scientific inquiry. That process should be held up as a model for learning. 
Young people need to know that the truths we derive about the physical universe 
must come from reason and scientific experimentation, not dogma. 
</P>
<P>
 Science cannot be regarded as one possible methodology for determining how 
things came to be, alongside whatever the Flat Earth Society, or anybody else, 
might postulate. At a time when religious zealots are conducting stealth 
campaigns to take over school boards, this challenge from someone on the front 
lines in the classroom should be resolved with a ringing affirmation from the 
courts. Educators have a right and a duty to teach science as science.

ANTI-SEMITISM AND AFROCENTRISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Recovering a Sense of Community," Commentary, July 12: 
</P>
<P>
 The definition of Afrocentrism professed by authors Xandra Kayden and Madison 
Shockley is narrow and misleading. They speak of "intellectuals carrying their 
arguments to extremes" and therefore negatively influencing "a generation of 
African American students." 
</P>
<P>
 I am an Afrocentric instructor of history on the community college level. If I 
am negatively influencing a generation of African American students, then I am 
equally guilty of negatively influencing the total generation of community 
college students. Racial gerrymandering of ethnic studies classrooms is the 
creation of Kayden and Shockley, not the educational establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The examples that are used to legitimize this incorrect definition are equally 
narrow and paint a racial identity on a non-racial entity. Africa is the home 
of man, we are all Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial labeling is most clearly expressed with color-based vocabulary. A black 
is clearly a racial being. An African is not. As an African, Afrocentrism 
places me at the center of society, asking the question, "What can I do to 
advance the human family to a higher level of human consciousness and loving 
appreciation?" 
</P>
<P>
 The statements made about the appreciation of the Jewish experience by 
Afrocentric scholars are presumptuous and shallow. The shallowness is expressed 
in the attempt to confine the history of African-Jewish relationships to the 
civil rights movement in the U.S. Afrocentric scholarship takes Egypt out of 
the Middle East, returns it to Africa, and defines Egyptian culture as the 
prime origin of Western culture. 
</P>
<P>
 I would think that the contributions of Hebrews to civilization would not be 
omitted from any ancient history class, whether Afrocentric or Eurocentric. 
Equally important, the omission of the commonality of experience of Jews and 
Africans in the diaspora would leave out the most productive source of 
psychological reaction to blatant oppression. The search for analogies between 
the reaction to Nazism and the reaction to chattel slavery is the prime source 
of tactics of denial of loss of identity that I find available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List' is a brilliant presentation of the ability to rationalize 
societal displacement. Jews wore armbands in a futile attempt to appease their 
oppressors. We stopped calling ourselves Africans with the same goal of 
appeasement. And so today, racial labeling is supported by African Americans 
who are comfortable with a label that means evil, slave and illegal.

PORTABLE DWELLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial, "Rethinking Home Sweet Home," (July 13), offers an 
endorsement for an interesting approach to the homeless crisis. While we 
applaud your attention to the crisis, unfortunately housing alone is not the 
answer to the complexities that create a homeless person. 
</P>
<P>
 Most homeless people are mentally disabled. Statistics show that somewhere 
between 60% and 80% of the homeless population are people with mental 
disabilities. This population needs more than housing. When governments create 
solutions to housing, whether the housing is portable or permanent, the mere 
sheltering of these people will rarely be enough. As U.S. Secretary of Housing 
and Urban Development Henry Cisneros has often remarked, we need a "continuum 
of care" when we deal with the homeless and those in need of affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless people are often people with a variety of emotional as well as 
work-related problems. They are in need of various types of counseling and 
economic support. While architectural students create innovative answers to the 
sheltering needs of the homeless, the social service and governmental policy 
studies schools should also be encourage to view "continuum of care" answers to 
one of this country's most intractable and growing problems.

IS AID ON THE WRONG TERMS RIGHT?; RWANDA: IF THE REFUGEES STAY IN ZAIRE, LIVING 
ON RELIEF, THEIR MEN WILL BE FREE TO RESUME WAR. 
</P>

 In the world of humanitarian relief, the law of unintended consequences of 
good intentions is becoming ever more important. More than 1 million Rwandan 
people, most of them members of the Hutu clan, have been led out of Rwanda at 
the instigation of their own leaders. The Hutu faction had mercilessly 
slaughtered an estimated 500,000 Tutsis while the world community passively 
watched, cluck-clucking about man's continuing inhumanity to man but lifting 
nary a finger to stop the slaughter of the innocent children whose dying faces 
stared out at us for more than two months on evening news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutus fled a country where, even if ravaged by war, there was food in the 
fields, a village life and structure and the war and dying had stopped. The 
refugees' political leaders want to deny the Tutsi victors a population with 
which to rebuild the country. With their families safely supported by the world 
community in Zaire, the Hutu militants want to regroup, rearm, go back in, kill 
the Tutsis and reconquer Rwanda. The job of the United Nations, the United 
States and other donor countries, if the Hutu leadership has its way, will be 
to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to keep their families alive in Zaire 
while the men and boys wage war. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutu leaders have been willing to lead their own children into areas where 
they will be threatened by cholera, and they are now intimidating their people 
and telling them not to return, that horrible things will happen to them if 
they go back to Rwanda. All evidence shows that more horrible things face those 
families in the death-saturated fields of Goma, Zaire. The new government of 
Rwanda has stated its intention to peacefully welcome the return of the 
population and to bring to justice the leaders of the Tutsi genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, should a newly sensitized world do if it wants to use its 
resources wisely in this region? The answer should be to use the relief aid as 
a magnet to move people back to Rwanda to get on with the harvest. The Rwandan 
families walked out a week ago, and those who are not sick can be given 
provisions and an escort back home. And those who stayed in Rwanda should not 
receive less from the world community. Help that goes to Rwanda also helps 
achieve Western governments' and the United Nations' goal of moving toward a 
more durable solution to the crisis. Putting 1 million people on an 
international food dole on the lava fields of Zaire is hardly a long-term 
answer, especially when they sit there because of a desire for political 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 When Iraqi Kurds came flooding into Turkey, the United States was quick to 
establish the relief network back inside Iraq, because Turkey did not want the 
Kurds, a potentially destabilizing force. Here, the situation is reversed. The 
Zairean thugs who have "the looting franchise" for the part of Zaire where the 
refugees have fled want the U.N. planes to keep landing in Goma. They hold up 
each plane until someone forks over money. If the refugees go back, the gold 
mine goes with them.  
</P>
<P>
 Somalia left the United States timid about anything that might be construed by 
the media as intervention in the affairs of an African state. We have said that 
we will work in Zaire and leave it up to the United Nations to work in Rwanda. 
While nobody wishes those desperate children in Goma to be shortchanged in any 
effort to save their lives, it is equally horrible to think that their return 
home will be held up because the United States is willing to help them only if 
they continue to be refugees living in horrendous health conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. humanitarian response to refugee needs has never been uncomplicated. 
In the 1980s, Afghans, Cambodians and Nicaraguans were encouraged to leave. 
Food and assistance served as a magnet, political leaders intimidated people 
not to return and we went along with it all. Families were supported for years 
while men fought against what we described as Soviet-supported opposition 
forces. The United States put a humanitarian cloak on what was essentially an 
anti-communist political policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that has changed. Rwanda is unlikely to become a country where peace and 
prosperity reign forever. But for the moment, our pocketbooks and hearts are 
open. The resources should be used where they will have the greatest long-term 
positive humanitarian and political effects. That is inside Rwanda, helping the 
country and the refugees return to normal.

PERSPECTIVE ON INSURANCE; MISGUIDED POLICIES -- THEN THE EARTHQUAKE; PRICE 
CONTROLS ONLY TEMPORARILY FORESTALL MARKET FORCES FOR HOMEOWNERS. NOW, THE 
DOUBLE WHAMMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Milken Institute for Job and Capital Formation in Santa Monica.

<P>
 "A Great Victory For Consumers!" "Puts People Before Profit!" Such was the 
tone of much sophisticated opinion upon passage in 1988 of Proposition 103, the 
"populist" measure imposing price controls on auto, homeowner and other 
insurance coverage. The initiative provided also for the direct election of the 
insurance commissioner, thus furthering the perverse politicization of the 
California insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
 A few lonely voices pointed out the obvious: that the insurance affordability 
crisis was the result of skyrocketing costs abetted in substantial part by 
misguided public policies, that an industry with thousands of firms must be 
highly competitive and that price controls enforced by ambitious politicians 
would reduce the availability and quality of insurance services, with adverse 
consequences for businesses, consumers, taxpayers and the California economy as 
a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, how those chickens have come home to roost. In the wake of the Northridge 
earthquake -- with losses vastly greater than predicted even in the 
"worst-case" assumptions by insurers -- the inevitable perversity of the 
Proposition 103 price controls has emerged, exacerbated by a misguided 1984 
state law forcing insurers to offer earthquake coverage to those purchasing 
homeowner coverage. Under outgoing Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, most 
rates for homeowner and earthquake coverage have been frozen since 1989, as 
Garamendi has attempted to extort rebates from insurers for the "rollback" 
period under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 This rate freeze -- the consumer price index has increased 20% since then -- 
is acute for earthquake coverage, in light of the new information about 
potential losses revealed by the Northridge disaster. Since insurers must offer 
earthquake coverage to all purchasers of homeowner policies, and since much 
earthquake insurance at the frozen 1989 rates is a clear loser for insurers, 
the required offer of earthquake insurance is equivalent to a tax on the 
premiums paid for homeowner policies. Thus has the linkage speeded up the 
availability crisis, but it would have developed in any event over time because 
of the price controls on homeowner coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the inevitable has come to pass. Farmers Insurance has suspended sales 
of new homeowner policies. State Farm will limit the number of policies to the 
1993 level. Twentieth Century will pull out of the homeowner coverage business 
completely after three years. Safeco has placed a moratorium on sales of 
earthquake policies and thus of homeowner policies in Southern California. 
Mercury no longer will offer homeowner policies unless they are purchased with 
other personal insurance such as auto coverage. Transamerica and Allstate have 
imposed a moratorium on new homeowner policies. 
</P>
<P>
 No one should be surprised at this outcome. As politics is the art of wealth 
redistribution, insurance rates determined in politicized regulatory processes 
inevitably will be used to subsidize favored interest groups at the expense of 
others. This ability to reward allies and punish foes -- that is, to exercise 
political power -- will draw the politically ambitious toward the office of 
insurance commissioner as a steppingstone upward. But ambition for higher 
office necessarily means a shortened time horizon with respect to the office 
held currently. Thus, insurance commissioners systematically will find it 
convenient to ignore the adverse longer-term consequences of their decisions, 
since it will be their successors who will have to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Garamendi's adverse behavior over these four years, driven by his 
gubernatorial ambitions, has not been an aberration. The office of insurance 
commissioner invites demagoguery and rewards efforts to transfer wealth from 
insurers in order to subsidize favored groups of constituents. A reasonable, 
farsighted commissioner would do what competitive markets do, that is, allocate 
rates in accordance with risks, and so would be subjected to attacks by 
"consumer" advocates and others pursuing their own political interests while 
masquerading as protectors of the downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
 Always looking for the politically expedient route, Garamendi has ordered that 
the California Fair Plan (an industry-financed insurer of last resort) offer 
its residential fire and earthquake coverage statewide. This enables him to 
avoid the political heat for approving broad rate increases for insurers, but 
any Fair Plan losses must be covered by insurers in proportion to their 
statewide business. This provides additional incentives for insurers to leave 
the state, a non-problem for Garamendi since it is his successor who will have 
to clean up the ensuing mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently forgetting that involuntary servitude is unconstitutional, 
Garamendi urges a new law preventing insurers from leaving the market. And, in 
a final effort to avoid the effects of his decisions, Garamendi wants Congress 
to come up with a national scheme for government insurance against all natural 
disasters, an idea that would lead inexorably to politicization of insurance 
markets across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the people of California, escape from the Proposition 103 trap will not be 
easy. Rates must be allocated in accordance with risks, but that outcome is 
impossible under the political dynamics of the current system. Depending on the 
outcome of a case now before the state Supreme Court, the Legislature may be 
able to force future insurance commissioners to make more farsighted decisions. 
Or perhaps a new ballot initiative may be required. However difficult a process 
that may be, the insurance sector is too important to be left to the 
politicians.

LEGAL ORDER AND MORAL TRUTH; OUR SOCIETY HAS BECOME OBSESSED WITH GUILT OR 
INNOCENCE. BUT WHAT REALLY MATTERS MORE IS RIGHT OR WRONG. 
</P>

Journal of Greater Los Angeles.

 When Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti met with representatives of Los Angeles' African 
American and Jewish communities last week, he was acknowledging the potential 
for social disruption inherent in the Simpson murder case. In his sessions with 
the community leaders, Garcetti said he was concerned that the trial not rip 
apart the social fabric, turning women against men, black against white, poor 
against rich. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-profile court cases emanating from this city recently reflect the 
divisions between us. The O.J. Simpson case will be no exception. Even before 
Simpson's arraignment, we were being turned against each other as trial 
balloons of defense strategy were floated in the New Yorker and Newsweek 
magazines, alleging a history of racial bias on the part of one of the 
investigating officers. This tactic immediately alerted those who fear a 
defense based on a loophole (thus obscuring the horrendous deaths of the 
victims) and diverted the city's minority communities into concern over the 
alleged racism of the LAPD. That controversy inevitably plagues the Simpson 
trial is not entirely the fault of the judicial system or even the media. The 
courts can only determine guilt or innocence relative to the burden of proof. 
They have little to say about what is morally right and wrong, the true concern 
of justice. That's why these cases rile us up, entreat us to take sides, prod 
us into attention -- but then leave us foundering in what the sages call in 
Hebrew mehuma, the unease of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 I frequently judge the moral confusion of an issue by how it is perceived by 
children. As the public courtroom spectacles of the past few years unfolded, 
I've struggled for simpler ways of describing the controversies to my daughter, 
now 12. She has asked me: Is it ever right to kill one's parents? To burn down 
a neighborhood when you're angry? To hit a stranger with a brick? To beat a 
criminal suspect into submission? She starts by asking me who is the bad guy. 
But what she wants to know is, what is right and wrong. She gets concerned when 
an obviously culpable person goes free, and she becomes confused when a court 
accepts root causes as excuses for anti-social acts. "You wouldn't accept that 
from me!" Samantha says. She's right. 
</P>
<P>
 We are different, the law and I. The law must consider gray areas of doubt in 
what might otherwise seem cut-and-dried fact situations. It is bound by a 
strict presumption of innocence and awaits the accumulation of evidence before 
rendering judgment. But in trying to raise a child with internal registers of 
good and evil, I am bound by none of these. Here, however, is a truth that's 
hard enough for an adult to understand: The courts are not the ultimate moral 
authority, nor a substitute for a strong commitment to personal ethics. Without 
these ingredients of social cohesion, our pursuit of justice naturally is 
reduced to calculation and formula as a democracy scatters its goodwill to the 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
 In our society, conscience, responsibility, relationship to God and fellow man 
are the realm of religion and ethics and designated a private affair. It's time 
to ask if the private realm is doing enough. The chaos in values is not about a 
lenient law. It's about our own failures to take seriously what instinct tells 
us is true: that there are standards of decency being breached, and the problem 
is in ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 While we criticize the judicial system and the media, we take our lead from 
them. We are fascinated to find lawsuits and criminal cases that illuminate the 
devil within. But after a trial or a segment of Oprah, we return to our own 
particular caves, concerned only with ourselves. We cannot expect to create an 
ethical society across racial, class, sexual and ethnic divides on a conscience 
geared to a bunker mentality and a 15-minute attention span. 
</P>
<P>
 Our bestseller lists reflect the craving for personal values, the reassertion 
not of the bottom line of the human ledger but of the upper level of 
civilization. The restoration of conscience demands that we ask: What do we owe 
each other? What are the minimum standards of respect and responsibility? What 
does it mean to be human? These high-profile cases are challenges to the moral 
order. The judicial system cannot be expected to do more than weigh evidence 
and mete out punishment. But teachers, clergy, civic leaders and we ourselves 
can acknowledge that guilt or innocence is for the jury. Right and wrong is for 
us.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; COLLIE: DEFINITELY A MIXED BREED

 Mark Collie once explained his mixture of rock and country influences by 
referring to himself as "John Cougar Mellencash." 
</P>
<P>
 During his 80-minute early set at the Crazy Horse Steak House on Monday, 
Collie drew not only from the classic rockabilly of Johnny Cash and the 
heartland rock associated with Mellencamp, but also from a variety of other 
rock, blues, and country sources. Perhaps Collie should call himself John Hank 
Lefty B.B. Elvis Cougar Mellencash. 
</P>
<P>
 The closer Collie edged to the primal roots of his music, the more electric 
his performance became. After delivering two of his recent catchy country-rock 
hits, "Born to Love You" and "She's Never Coming Back," Collie delved more 
deeply into pure country soul. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised the excitement level in the room with a trio of honky-tonk anthems, 
"Something with a Ring to It," "Where There's Smoke," and "When the Sun Goes 
Down." His crescendo of raw Memphis R & B passion peaked with his full-bore 
emotional rendition of his hit "Shame Shame Shame Shame," which elicited cheers 
and screams from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Building on his strengths, Collie paid tribute to Johnny Cash with a haunting 
reading of Cash's hit "Ring of Fire," drawn from Collie's new "Unleashed" 
album. Collie further played his blues and country influences against each 
other with a blazing rendition of "Hillbilly Boy With the Rock 'n' Roll Blues," 
a selection from his 1993 breakthrough album, "Mark Collie." 
</P>
<P>
 His five-piece band, the Dogs, was able to follow Collie's stylistic twists 
and turns with ease. The group's two lead guitarists, Lance Dary and Brian 
Franklin, represented two sides of Collie's musical persona: Dary stepped out 
for wailing blues-rock guitar solos, while Franklin shined on country leads. At 
the beginning of "Unleashed," the pair locked frets in an exciting guitar duel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the show, Collie kept the emphasis on the music by confining his 
between-song patter to introductions directly related to each number. Collie's 
brief discussions of his songs painted a vivid picture of the struggling 
songwriter's lot in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when he introduced "Where There's Smoke," one of his favorites of 
the many songs he has written, he joked: "This song has started and stopped 
several careers. Jason Williams recorded it. Have you ever heard of him?" When 
nobody in the crowd responded, Collie said, "See." 
</P>
<P>
 Collie's only miscue came when he engaged the audience in a couple of 
distracting sing-alongs. Just as he had whipped the crowd into a peak of 
excitement with his sweaty, passionate delivery of "Shame Shame Shame Shame," 
he turned the microphone to the audience. The crowd's half-hearted response had 
the same effect as letting the air out of the tires of a speeding hot rod. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, after he had whipped the crowd up with his energetic performance of 
"Unleashed," Collie embarrassed members of the audience by goading reluctant 
individuals to sing its chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 Collie's 15-song set emphasized his two most recent albums, "Mark Collie" and 
"Unleashed." Collie also included a few selections from his earlier albums that 
hewed closer to straight country: "Hardin County Line" and "Born and Raised in 
Black and White." 
</P>
<P>
 After rocking the house with his hits, Collie changed the pace by encoring 
with a contemplative ballad he has not yet recorded.

CENSORSHIP ATTACKS CLOUD NEW PBS CHIEF'S MESSAGE; TELEVISION: PRESIDENT ERVIN 
S. DUGGAN DELIVERS AN 'OPTIMISTIC' SPEECH, BUT PROTESTERS ACCUSE THE NETWORK OF 
FAILING TO AIR CONTROVERSIAL PROJECTS. 
</P>

 PBS President Ervin S. Duggan, making his debut Tuesday before the semi-annual 
gathering of the nation's television writers and critics, said he brought a 
message of "feistiness" and "optimism" about the non-commercial network he has 
headed for nearly six months. But he quickly ran into a barrage of questions 
that seemed to imply PBS was censoring controversial content. 
</P>
<P>
 Duggan, a former Federal Communications Commissioner and a longtime 
inside-the-Beltway official who had been a speech writer in Lyndon Johnson's 
White House, responded that he was "hot under the collar" about charges of 
censorship, that it was "debasing the language" to use that word, and that 
anyone suggesting PBS would delete material because it was controversial is 
"trying to gull you." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Universal City Hilton, a group called Coalition vs. PBS Censorship 
distributed materials attacking PBS for not airing "Defending Our Lives," a 
30-minute film about domestic violence that won this year's Academy Award for 
short documentary, and "The Fire This Time," a film about the 1992 Los Angeles 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Jennifer Lawson, executive vice president for programming, more 
than 100 organizations and individuals asked: "Are battered women only supposed 
to be heard in sound bites edited by others? Is it a violation of your 
guidelines for them to participate in shaping the debate?" Among the signers 
were 28 statewide coalitions on domestic violence, including the Los Angles 
Committee on Assaults Against Women; State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica); 
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick and actor Alec Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Duggan indicated that the domestic violence film violated "editorial 
guidelines" because the material was prepared by groups involved in the issue 
of battered women. As for the riot film, Duggan said similar material was 
covered on PBS by "Frontline." 
</P>
<P>
 When producer Randy Holland, who attended the press conference, said his riot 
documentary covered areas that had not been dealt with, including FBI and Los 
Angeles Police Department attacks on community groups such as Watts Writers 
Workshop and the Black Panthers, Duggan asserted PBS' own First Amendment right 
to make "editorial decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite "pressure from the resolute right and the coercive left, we are a 
resolute cool little network," Duggan said, adding: "We live at ground zero in 
the nuclear attacks that occur in the cultural wars." 
</P>
<P>
 The most persistent questioning centered on PBS' declining to fund a sequel 
for Armisted Maupin's Emmy-nominated series, "Tales of the City." Duggan said 
it was all "economics," noting that the original "Tales" cost PBS between 
$150,000 and $200,000 and that a sequel was going to be 10 times that. 
</P>
<P>
 Duggan also noted that he was "troubled" by the future of American drama on 
public television because it is expensive but he said that he would take a 
"pro-active role" on behalf of PBS stations in seeking funding from 
corporations. He said he would like to bring Hallmark Hall of Fame productions 
such as "Miss Rose White" to PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 As for public affairs programming, a linchpin in PBS' lineup, Duggan revealed 
that former Ronald Reagan speech writer Peggy Noonan would have her own series. 
</P>
<P>
 So intense was the confrontation between Duggan and the press that the 
session, which was to have lasted 45 minutes, took an hour and 40 minutes. 
Still, Duggan kept his sense of humor. Referring to the vast financial 
resources of Turner Broadcasting System, he noted, "And he (Ted Turner) has 
Jane Fonda."

2 KILLED IN ROCKETDYNE EXPLOSION; TEST: THE MEN DIE INSTANTLY FROM THE CHEMICAL 
BLAST AT THE SIMI HILLS LAB. A THIRD WORKER IS SERIOUSLY INJURED. THE CAUSE IS 
NOT KNOWN.

 Two men were killed instantly and a third seriously injured Tuesday morning 
when a chemical explosion ripped through Rockwell International's rocket engine 
test site on a rugged plateau in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9:13 a.m. blast at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory -- so powerful that 
some nearby residents mistook it for an earthquake -- did not ignite any 
buildings at the guarded, 2,700-acre hilltop facility. 
</P>
<P>
 It did, however, touch off a brush fire in the boulder-strewn chaparral 
surrounding the plant. The fire blackened 15 acres and was extinguished in an 
hour, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion's victims were preparing for a controlled burn of a catalyst 
used in solid fuel rocket motors when something went wrong, said Rockwell 
spokesman Paul Sewell. The three Rockwell employees were standing near an 
outdoor 10-by-12-foot steel test stand at the time of the blast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not supposed to explode," Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the blast at Rockwell's Rocketdyne division was not immediately 
clear, and an investigation by fire officials and work place safety 
investigators continued. Although officials were still reviewing company 
records, Tuesday's accident is believed to be the first fatal accident in the 
plant's 47-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men killed were identified as Larry A. Pugh, 51, a Thousand Oaks 
engineer who had worked for Rockwell since 1977, and Otto K. Heiney, 53, of 
Canoga Park, who had been an engineer with the company for 10 years. A Rockwell 
official was en route to Florida on Tuesday afternoon to deliver the news to 
Heiney's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were co-workers, these were friends and people we all knew very well," 
Sewell said. "And we tremendously hate to see them lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The injured worker, Lee Wells, 62, of Newbury Park was taken to Simi Valley 
Hospital, and later airlifted to the burn center at the Sherman Oaks Community 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells, a chief test mechanic for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, suffered 
second- and third-degree burns over 20% of his body, mostly on the left side of 
his head, neck and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was blown back 5 feet, and he hit the hill," said Dr. Richard 
Grossman, director of the burn center. "He has cuts on his face. It was 
probably from some kind of metal." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fick, a friend and neighbor, described Wells as a devoted and highly 
skilled Rockwell employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm upset and a little shocked, because he's such a cautious guy, real clean, 
careful," Fick said. "He's very mechanically inclined. I knew he worked with 
rocket engines and testing, but I had no idea that he worked with chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
 Fick said he is confident that Wells will fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a tough old goat," Fick said. "He'll battle through this." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said Wells, a 32-year Rockwell employee, had worked with the two men 
who were killed for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two unidentified Rockwell workers who participated in the test escaped injury 
in Tuesday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell said the experiment involved 10 pounds of glycidal azide polymer and 
nitrocellulose, chemicals used to enhance the ignition of solid and liquid 
propellants used in rocket engines. He said the material was to be burned to 
determine its characteristics so it could be properly packaged, labeled and 
transported. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, the test burn would be triggered electronically by technicians 
standing a safe distance away, Sewell said. "They were all near the (test 
stand) when the accident occurred," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident is being investigated by Rockwell, Cal/OSHA and Ventura County 
fire officials. Ventura County sheriff's officials said that the U.S. Air Force 
was also involved in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to find out the cause of the accident," Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Susana Field Laboratory is perhaps best-known as a rocket engine 
test site for the U.S. Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. The facility has been in operation since 1947, when it was 
opened by Rocketdyne's predecessor, North American Aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell has tested engines for virtually every U.S. rocket program, including 
the space shuttle and the first manned flight to the moon. Current work 
includes testing of Atlas and Delta rocket engines that propel communication 
satellites into space, and the development of hardware for NASA's space station 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The last publicized accident to occur at the lab site was on Aug. 25, 1988. In 
that accident, a 52-year-old engineer lost his hand in an explosion that 
occurred while he was mixing a small quantity of solid propellants used to make 
rocket fuel. A similar accident occurred in 1985 at Rockwell's Canoga Avenue 
plant involving a research chemist who was severely burned while mixing solid 
propellants. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Tuesday's accident, officials at Rockwell, which employs 742 people at 
the Santa Susana Lab, did not call for an evacuation. No buildings were damaged 
and the 15-acre brush fire ignited by the blast was quickly extinguished by 
Rockwell's own fire department working with crews from the Ventura and Los 
Angeles county fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents of the Summit mobile home park on Woolsey Canyon Road, down 
the hill from the lab, said they thought the explosion was an earthquake 
because it shook their walls slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard a boom and the windows rattled a bit," said Melissa Barros, 32, who 
was staying with her sister in a double-wide mobile home overlooking the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, Barbara Cole said she heard a "little pop" and thought it was 
an aftershock or the rising heat causing her metal awning to bend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw helicopters and thought they must be looking for something," she said. 
"But there's always helicopters and planes flying over. I never thought it was 
Rocketdyne." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the hilltop mobile home residents saw smoke from the small brush fire, 
but Kurt Horstman, 30, said he noticed an acrid smell shortly after the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did smell pretty bad, but that's about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Huff, a 22-year resident of nearby Black Canyon Road and leader of a 
neighborhood effort to learn more about Rockwell's Santa Susana operations, 
said she is eager to know the exact cause of Tuesday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course a million things go through your mind when Rocketdyne's been part 
of your whole life," she said. "What were they doing? What were the chemicals 
doing? What were they mixing them for?"

 WITHOUT A CLUE: Last week's decision by the Rams to release running back 
Russell White still puzzles his former Crespi High coach, Bill Redell. Redell, 
who coached White in the late 1980s, can't figure out why he didn't get more 
playing time last year. . . . "There must be more to this," Redell said, 
"because he certainly has the ability to play in the NFL."

 NEW WORLD: After shaking hands with Yasser Arafat last year, it may not seem 
such a shock for Israel to make peace with a longtime enemy. But Rabbi Harold 
Schulweis of Valley Beth Shalom in Encino says this week's meeting between 
Israel's Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein (A6) is still a big event. . . 
"No one five years ago would have dreamed this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 NO SURRENDER: Jaime Barajas (above) serves pretty well on the court, and even 
better on the streets. Barajas, who played tennis at CSUN and still competes in 
local tournaments, is a patrol officer with the LAPD. He spends a lot of time 
looking for victims of child abuse. . . He's conquered many tough opponents, 
but none tougher than cancer (C8).

 MIGHTY CASTING: Hundreds in their teens and 20s crammed into Burbank on Monday 
to save the Earth from evil. And who said Generation X doesn't stand for 
anything? Well, actually, they showed up to audition for "Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers," the TV show about teen-age superheroes (F1). . . . It's still too 
early to judge the fate of the planet, but the casting call did cause a minor 
traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
 BOOK IT: Work is moving fast on major repairs needed to reopen CSUN's Oviatt 
Library by late August (B3). . . . Earthquake damage to the library, which 
opened in 1973, actually could have been worse. Only a handful of books were 
ruined, and just several thousand of the 1.1 million need rebinding. "The 
collection was preserved quite well," said Doug Davis, associate dean of the 
library. Michael Arkush

FATAL EXPLOSION AT ROCKETDYNE; PUBLIC FEARS, GOVERNMENT CONTROLS PUT PRESSURE 
ON LAB; HISTORY: ROCKWELL'S DIVISION PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
U.S. ROCKET PROGRAM SINCE LATE '40S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Susana Field Laboratory, rocked Tuesday by an explosion that killed 
two workers and seriously injured a third, has long been devoted to harnessing 
powerful forces, but apparently never with more gruesome results. 
</P>
<P>
 Set on a rugged plateau in the Simi Hills amid weirdly beautiful rock 
formations, the nearly 2,700-acre test site, owned by Rockwell International's 
Rocketdyne division, has played a storied role in the development of U.S. 
rocketry since the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, the lab, known within Rocketdyne as "Santa Sue," has been 
the object of public fears and government fines for environmental pollution -- 
scrutiny that may increase after Tuesday's disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The site, where 742 workers are now employed, was first used in 1947 by North 
American Aviation, Rocketdyne's predecessor, to dismantle and analyze the 
engine of the German V-2 rocket that had terrorized England during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rocketdyne emerged as the country's main builder of rocket engines, Santa 
Susana was used to test engines for virtually every U.S. rocket program -- 
including those that powered the first manned flight to the moon and those that 
carry nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Wernher von Braun and other German rocket scientists became regular visitors 
to the site, according to company officials. With its backdrop of sandstone and 
sage, the site also was used to film Westerns and other feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 The space shuttle's main engines -- built less than a half-hour away at 
Rocketdyne's Canoga Avenue plant -- formerly were tested at Santa Susana but 
now are tested at a site in Mississippi. Current work includes testing of Atlas 
and Delta rocket engines that propel communications satellites into space. 
</P>
<P>
 Although largely devoted to rocket work for such customers as the Air Force 
and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, nearly 300 acres of the 
facility has been reserved for research and development projects for the U.S. 
Department of Energy. Currently, the company operates the DOE's Energy 
Technology Research Center there. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1950s through 1980s, the energy work included the operation of small 
nuclear test reactors and recycling of highly contaminated spent fuel from 
nuclear fuel rods. Although it was not widely publicized until 20 years later, 
a test reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1959. The company later said 
there was no danger to the public or workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Public disclosure in 1989 of lingering, low-level contamination from past 
nuclear projects sparked a public furor and prompted Rocketdyne to halt nuclear 
research there the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 With heightened public awareness of the once-remote site has come tougher 
government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the energy research area of the site, the Department of Energy is funding a 
multimillion-dollar cleanup of buildings, soil and ground water tainted by 
chemical and radioactive contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the rocket testing area, Rocketdyne is engaged in a multiyear cleanup 
of ground water contaminated with chemical solvents that were used to rinse 
rocket engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting liability, Rocketdyne during the 1980s and early '90s paid 
workers' compensation settlements to at least eight former employees who 
alleged they had suffered radiation-induced cancer. With funding from DOE, a 
team of UCLA researchers is studying whether energy research workers have 
suffered unusual rates of disease from radiation or chemical exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental lapses at Santa Susana also figured in two large settlements 
paid by Rockwell to resolve state hazardous waste complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, Rockwell agreed to a $650,000 settlement involving 46 
alleged violations at Santa Susana and at plant sites in Palmdale and El 
Segundo. And in November, 1990, the company agreed to pay $280,000 to resolve a 
hazardous waste complaint involving Santa Susana and its Canoga Avenue plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints did not charge the company with pollution per se, but with 
failure to comply with waste storage, record-keeping and reporting 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne officials said they were unaware of any fatal accidents at Santa 
Susana prior to Tuesday's explosion, but were still checking records. They said 
the blast, which blew apart a 10-by-12-foot test stand, did not affect other 
buildings or operations at the site.

CULTURE WATCH; POCHO POWER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Hunger of Memory," Richard Rodriguez's memoir about growing up Mexican 
American, introduced English-speaking readers to the Spanish word pocho. 
Meaning, literally, "pallid," pocho, Rodriguez explained, was used 
disparagingly of those who had assimilated to the dominant American 
culture.Other nonwhite groups have comparable words or metaphors about 
whiteness. Thus, an "apple Indian" is red on the outside, white on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 But the history of many an insulting epithet is that the insulted eventually 
claim it as a badge of honor. That seems to be happening with pocho in the 
songs of Chicano Roots/World Music bands like Dr. Loco's Rockin' Jalapeno Band, 
appearing later this week in three Los Angeles venues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the group's 1992 CD, "Movimiento Music," the cut "Mexicanamericanos" ( sic 
, which is to say neither Spanish mexicanoamericanos nor English Mexican 
Americans ) is described as "puro pocho pride played en polka time" and 
includes the refrain: " Por our mothers somos Mexican/ por destino 
americanos/comprendemos el English / and we speak el castellano /we're 
bilingues to the bone/we're puritito Chicanos." 
</P>
<P>
 The exponents of "English Only" must wince at these lyrics, but 800 years ago 
any exponent of Anglo-Saxon only or French only would surely have winced at the 
ungodly mishmash of the two that was beginning to catch on in England. Are the 
Chicanos the 20th-Century equivalent of the Norman French? Maybe not, but check 
out the latest McDonald's billboard: "Eggs traordinario Desayuno. "

BARAJAS PILES UP VICTORIES ON, OFF COURT; TENNIS: CHILDHOOD STRUGGLES, BOUT 
WITH CANCER HELP LAPD OFFICER FROM GRANADA HILLS PUT POSITIVE SPIN ON LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jaime Barajas was reclining in a chair and toweling off after a convincing 
second-round victory last week in a pre-qualifying tournament for the Los 
Angeles Open when he was asked to recall his greatest victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas -- 6 feet 1, 175 pounds, broad shoulders -- had just trounced Arthur 
Tombakian of Los Angeles, 6-2, 6-4. He had routed his opponent with a vicious 
serve-and-volley attack. But the question drew a blank expression and he fell 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas smiled weakly. He said he has never won a major tournament, never 
upset a nationally ranked player. There were no great victories. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barajas, a 30-year-old Granada Hills resident, has no regrets. He's once 
again powerful, aggressive and thriving on top-flight competition. After cancer 
threatened his life nearly four years ago, the former Cal State Northridge 
singles player counts victories only in the game of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of struggles in my life, but I've always been a real positive 
guy," he said. "I look at it as a challenge -- a chance to prove myself. Tennis 
is fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas was raised by migrant farmers and worked in fields as a child. Tennis 
was his vehicle out of that environment -- it led to a college degree and, for 
a while, a career as a tennis instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 Through tennis, Barajas also met his wife, who came from a well-to-do family 
in Mexico. Four years ago, Barajas scrapped his career in tennis and joined the 
Los Angeles Police Department. He continued to patrol the courts as a player, 
though, winning five gold medals in the Police Olympics -- including a mixed 
doubles title with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not chasing bad guys with the LAPD, Barajas canvasses the 
schoolyards of West L.A. for victims of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encounter a lot of situations that could result in death," Barajas said. 
"I've not had any close calls. But you never know. A simple family dispute can 
turn deadly." 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas faced his own mortality before he had taken his first ride in a squad 
car: Doctors diagnosed cancer after a lymphoid tumor was discovered in his 
small intestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgery and six months of chemotherapy kept Barajas from graduating from the 
police academy with his class. Nearing the end of his third year in remission, 
Barajas shows no sign of a relapse. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, he had his best year on the Southern California senior circuit. He 
was ranked 23rd in men's 30-and-over singles and 55th in open singles. "He's a 
physical specimen and he's made this incredible comeback," said Annette Buck, 
director of adult and senior tennis for the Southern California Tennis Assn. 
"If he spent more time on the court, he'd be a lot more successful. But he's a 
family man. For him, tennis is not the end-all, be-all. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a wonderful family, (two) children and a career. He's a complete 
person. Tennis is just a part of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas was born in Mexico, the youngest of nine children. His parents moved 
to California when Jaime was a toddler. As a boy, he cut lettuce, broccoli and 
strawberries with the rest of his family in fields near Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up watching "Dragnet" and "Adam 12" on television and dreamed of being 
a police officer. But tennis took over as his No. 1 love when two of his 
brothers introduced him to the sport. The two learned to play in Hawaii, where 
they worked in the construction business. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime saw tennis as a means to a better way of life. He had two goals: to play 
college tennis and graduate. He accomplished both at Northridge. During his 
senior season in 1986, he played No. 4 singles and on a doubles team that beat 
a UNLV team featuring Scott Warner, who later played at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas was accomplished enough as a teen-ager to play in satellite pro 
tournaments in Mexico. He was playing in his native city of Jerez, Zacatecas, 
in 1983 when he met his wife, Lourdes Escobedo, who was born in Los Angeles and 
raised in Jerez. The two wrote each other for five years before marrying in 
1988. "He was my only boyfriend," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She had grown up a tennis player in an affluent family. She knew he worked the 
fields as a boy and sensed that life had been difficult. Lourdes didn't know 
much about adversity, she said, until Jaime's cancer was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life was very easy to that point," she said. "I always got whatever I 
wanted. I never suffered anything. He has suffered a lot. He worked at 6 or 7, 
even when he didn't have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime said Lourdes, who was six months pregnant with their second child when 
they learned of the cancer, helped keep him strong through the frightening 
ordeal. That comes as a surprise to Lourdes. "I wasn't strong -- he gave me 
that strength," she said. "I thought he was going to die. He made me strong 
because he's so positive all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barajas: "It was a wake-up call. It was a big surprise. Not too many 
people have it at that age. But I had a lot of faith and didn't think about it 
too much. I went along with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas always has dedicated himself to helping others. After graduating, he 
became director of Northridge's tennis facility and began teaching the game. 
After he switched to law enforcement, he was assigned to the schoolyards of 
West L.A. "There's a lot of innocent victims out there," he said. "There's a 
lot of people who want help and direction." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that attracted Lourdes to Jaime, she said, was his compassion. Five 
minutes after the Jan. 17 earthquake rocked his Granada Hills home, Barajas 
began knocking on doors, making sure his neighbors were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he will be instructing new officers at the police academy, an assignment 
he chose because he enjoys teaching. And while he's breaking in the new guys, 
Barajas can tell them there isn't a cop around who can beat him on the tennis 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas is the reigning two-time open-division champion of the Police 
Olympics. But the competition is much stiffer in SCTA events. In eight previous 
L.A. Open pre-qualifying tournaments, Barajas had been eliminated after two 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, he won his first two matches and pushed highly regarded Philip 
Tseng, losing, 7-5, 6-4, in a closely contested match. Tseng, a 
Harvard-Westlake High graduate, had just returned from the U.S. Olympic 
Festival and will play next year at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 One was left wondering how good Barajas might be if he devoted more time to 
the sport. Perhaps, Barajas wonders the same thing. If so, he doesn't let on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just enjoying having a good time," he said.

 Highlights of the weapons trial of former Newbury Park All-American football 
player Leodes Van Buren on Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Marcie James, the key witness in the trial of Van Buren, stunned prosecutors 
when she testified that she is now Van Buren's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * James also testified that a companion of the defendant fired shots into her 
home, not Van Buren. She said she originally accused Van Buren because she was 
angry with him.

SHADES OF OPINION; SUNGLASSES PART OF GOLF'S NEW LOOK, BUT PURISTS TAKE DIM 
VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's paradoxical, really. 
</P>
<P>
 Most golfers will spend a small fortune on anything that might help improve 
their score. Graphite-shafted drivers that cost $250. Custom-made clubs of 
questionable merit marketed on TV infomercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-sized irons. 
</P>
<P>
 Undersized bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Oversized price tags. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubs forged of composite aluminum, steel, beryllium, graphite or titanium. 
Everything but Kryptonite. 
</P>
<P>
 Those marketing pricey wares always have an eye on the future and, it seems, 
the eyes of top players soon will be covered by sunglasses costing upward of 
$150 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend hacks, of course, have worn shades for years. However, the game's best 
players steadfastly have refused for a variety of dubious reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't drive my car without them," said Craig Steinberg, an optometrist and 
one of the Southland's best amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he won't drive a ball with them. Steinberg, a three-time winner of the 
Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur championship, said he hasn't worn shades 
while playing for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * He believes the coloring of the lens negatively affects his ability to read 
the texture and grain of greens as well as the consistency of sand in bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
 * He can see the eyeglass frame in his peripheral vision as he swings the 
club, a major distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major reason, of course, is sheer obstinacy. Golf is steeped in 
tradition, perhaps more than any sport other than baseball. Sunglasses have 
existed for decades, yet no top player worth his salt would have been caught 
dead wearing a pair until recently. It was heresy. Fuzzy Zoeller is one of a 
handful of PGA Tour regulars who now wear sunglasses while playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of top players excelled for years while wearing prescription lenses -- 
Hale Irwin, for instance -- and lived to talk about it. Shades are another 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody would have dreamed of wearing sunglasses when Jack Nicklaus was 20 
years old," said Steinberg, who lives in Van Nuys. "It wasn't part of the 
dress, part of the uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the youngsters are changing the sartorial rules. At the SCGA Amateur 
championship last weekend in La Habra Heights, several college hot-shots wore 
sunglasses while competing. The old guard squinted along, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 In the college ranks, dozens of top players swear by their wraparound shades. 
They've become de rigueur in the NCAA ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't play without them now," said Jason Gore of Valencia, a two-time 
Pacific 10 Conference champion from Arizona. "When I take them off, I get a 
headache." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said despite the presence of a condition that often causes considerable 
discomfort when his eyes are exposed to the sun, he never wore shades until 
last spring. Few top players did, so he didn't, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gamez, who played at Arizona and wears sunglasses while competing on 
the PGA Tour, donated several pairs to his alma mater. Players swept them up 
and quickly became converts. How much does Gore like his sunglasses? He now 
wears three pairs tinted in various hues. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore wears contact lenses and says the shades keep wind-blown irritants out of 
his eyes. What's more, Gore believes his wraparound lenses help, not hinder, 
his ability to read greens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel you can read a green better if you're not squinting," said Gore, who 
finished ninth at the SCGA Amateur. "You get a better look." 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Wright of Ventura, a sophomore at USC, also wears sunglasses while 
playing. College events often require 36 holes a day, which can result in 
severe eye irritation and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Gore, Wright started wearing sunglasses in the spring and already swears 
by them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd wear them," Wright said. "It was just something golfers 
don't do. But these are so comfortable, I don't even notice I have them on." 
</P>
<P>
 Practicality aside, the medical benefits of shades are even more significant. 
Steinberg said recent clinical studies have found a link between bright 
sunlight and cataract growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of this is just coming to light -- no pun intended," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said a good pair of sunglasses filters out certain bands of light 
that can cause harm to the eyes or cause vision to be blurred. Acuity increases 
and distortion virtually disappears. So far, so good, right? 
</P>
<P>
 That said, it should be noted that Steinberg, 36, wears neither a hat nor 
sunglasses. But that doesn't mean he doesn't appreciate the risks involved. He 
simply hasn't been able to make the adjustment to wearing shades after all 
these years. Perhaps younger players can make the transition easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's room for personal judgment," he said. "Guys on the Senior PGA Tour 
wear wide-brimmed hats because they're old enough to appreciate the skin-cancer 
risks. Musicians are wearing earplugs because the Rolling Stones or whoever are 
all deaf now." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara's John Pate, 34, is a top amateur who finished in a tie for 
fourth at the SCGA while wearing sunglasses. His brother, Steve, has made a 
small fortune on the PGA Tour and does not. Canoga Park's Don Baker, 43, tied 
Pate for fourth and wore shades between shots. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, stoic members of the old school can be slow to accept change -- 
especially if nobody is leading the charge. Once a few top players slide into a 
pair of snazzy frames, though, watch the frenzy begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "People might think it looks funny," Wright said. "Pretty soon, I think people 
on tour will start wearing them." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience has been that if you gave somebody two shots off their average 
and cancer," Steinberg said, "They'd still take the two shots."

<P>
 Stocks sagged Tuesday under the weight of some disappointing corporate 
earnings and ongoing worries about interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Unimpressive quarterly results from energy companies and some other blue chips 
depressed the Dow Jones industrial average, which eased 6.16 points to 
3,735.68. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, losers led winners by about 5 to 4 on the Big Board, where the 
trading pace remained sluggish at just 231 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture was far different in Mexico City, however: Stocks there surged to 
their highest level in six weeks amid optimism about second-quarter earnings, 
which have come in surprisingly strong so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa stock index soared 79.46 points to 2,393.40, after rising 13.28 
points Monday and 67.85 points last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, Tuesday's weakness coincided with an uneasy atmosphere in the 
bond market as the Treasury sold $17.30 billion in two-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Though demand for the new notes turned out to be slightly better than expected 
-- the average yield was 6.17%, down from an expected 6.18% -- longer-term 
yields still inched up for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the key 30-year T-bond rose to 7.54% from 7.52% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury will test the market again today when it sells five-year notes. 
Any shortfall in demand for the notes could signal that investors remain 
skittish about the potential for another rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan issued what many 
economists believe was a veiled warning that the central bank is poised to 
boost short-term rates again to further slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 While watching the edgy bond market, equity investors monitored corporate 
earnings reports Tuesday, coming away particularly unimpressed with energy 
companies' depressed results. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil and gas stocks under pressure included Chevron, down 3/4 to 43; Texaco, 
off 7/8 to 62 1/8; Amoco, down 1 1/8 to 58 7/8; Sonat, down 3/4 to 32 1/2, and 
Unocal, off 1/4 to 29. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boeing fell 7/8 to 45 1/8 after posting a 48% drop in its second-quarter 
profit due to sharply lower sales. It said commercial jet deliveries are 
expected to remain low through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another Dow stock, Eastman Kodak, reported earnings close to predictions, 
but the stock still tumbled 1 5/8 to 47 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software company Powersoft slid 7 1/2 to 43 in heavy Nasdaq trading after 
company officials said third-quarter earnings would be even with or below those 
posted in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, Digital Equipment rose 1 to 19 3/4 after reporting a 
fourth-quarter loss but vowing to claw back to profitability by the end of the 
calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among NYSE-traded Mexican stocks, Telmex leaped 1 1/2 to 58 3/4, Grupo 
Tribasa gained 1 3/4 to 29, Televisa surged 2 1/4 to 53 7/8 and Grupo Simec 
added 7/8 to 24 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the positive earnings news of Telmex, Grupo Carso and other companies," 
investors bought shares of other firms that will report second-quarter earnings 
later this week, said Al Hassinger, a trader at Abaco International. 
</P>
<P>
 Other foreign markets also closed higher. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX 
average ended up 15.74 points at 2,151.96, while Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei 
average closed at 20,345.37, up 47.71 points. 
</P>
<P>
 London's Financial Times 100-share average rose 11.1 points to 3,117.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar ended mostly lower against key currencies in a second 
consecutive session of quiet trading. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 
98.28 Japanese yen, down from 98.75 on Monday. It also fell against the German 
mark, ending at 1.584 marks, down from 1.590. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, platinum futures shot to their highest level in more 
than 3 1/2 years on forecasts for strong Japanese demand and worries about 
supply disruptions in South Africa and Russia, the two largest producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum for October delivery surged $9.40 on the New York Merc to $430.50 an 
ounce.

THE CUTTING EDGE / COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; FORUM; WHAT INTERNET 
USERS THINK OF PORN INCIDENT, MEDIA COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, The Cutting Edge invited comment on the issues raised by a July 12 
Times story about the discovery of a large cache of pornography on an 
Internet-linked computer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The 
original story also discussed how the Internet was being used to distribute 
stolen software. 
</P>
<P>
 The article drew angry responses from many Internet users; we printed some of 
those responses last week, along with a brief commentary. We also asked readers 
for their thoughts on the issues of security on the Internet and on the news 
media's coverage of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial reaction on the Net to the story was heavy with personal attacks 
on the reporter, but nearly all of the more than 40 people who responded to our 
solicitation addressed the serious issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Below are excerpts from some of the messages we received, followed by our 
comments: 
</P>

<P>
 Unfortunately for those of us who love it dearly, you made (the Internet) out 
to be a big, bad thing. Very little was said about its positive applications. . 
. . I got no sense of what an incredible resource it is.

 I found the July 12 story on the illegal use of LLNL computers to be highly 
interesting. . . . I think the L.A. Times received so much flap over the story 
from Internet users because no one is ever delighted with investigative 
journalists poking their noses into his/her affairs. The Internet is a public 
place, and journalists have the right to poke around if they choose. That does 
not mean that the people whose affairs are being investigated have to like it. 
. . . I did take issue with the focus on pornographic images in the article. 
This seemed to be a clear shot at sensationalizing the findings.

 Essentially, the persons who put those images on the computers were merely 
stealing -- stealing storage space from Lawrence Livermore. Would it have been 
a newsworthy story if someone had found that an MTA (Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority) employee had used MTA filing cabinets to store a few 
hundred copies of Penthouse magazine or adult videotapes? Of course not.

 The real story, which you are missing, is how this free flow of information is 
revolutionizing the way people work and interact. The Internet is the ultimate 
productivity tool, and the print media are failing to get that issue across to 
their readers. That, not the aberrations on which the media have focused, is 
the reason why traffic on the Net increases by 10% a month. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With rising concerns about stolen software, pornography, etc., I am worried 
that institutions (usually colleges) will remove or severely restrict the 
ability of users to contribute to their creative works. I wish to urge 
institutions too concerned about undesirable contributions to make their 
incoming directories write-only (chmod 333) rather than removing them 
altogether. This will give the site administrators a chance to review files 
before putting them in a public area.

 We must find a balance between total freedom on the 'Net, which may have been 
possible when there were only a few hundred thousand connected but certainly is 
not now, and the kind of watchdog police state that many foresee as the future. 
. . . Oddly, to me it seems like those most aggressive in defending the 
anarchic nature of the 'Net are the same ones who are quickest to step on the 
toes of anyone who doesn't toe THEIR line.

<P>
 Many respondents made comments similar to Robin Roberts', asserting that 
storing private files on a government or company computer was not a major 
issue. But the computer was accessible via the Internet -- and almost certainly 
would not have been used to store 2 gigabytes of pornography had it not been. 
To use Roberts' analogy, it is as if the MTA employee had turned his office 
into a library and invited the public to use the high-speed elevator in the 
back to gain access. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people said that security is strictly the responsibility of the 
individual computer sites and not of the network itself. Clearly, though, the 
growing speed and reach of the Internet makes site security on Net-linked 
systems much more problematic. In future stories, The Cutting Edge will explore 
the practical, day-to-day problems of managing Net-linked computers. 
</P>
<P>
 We are always interested in suggestions -- from both the Internet-literate and 
those who aren't yet on-line -- on how to improve our coverage of the Internet 
and other complex technology issues. Send your comments to Cutting 
Edge@news.latimes.com, or fax them to (213) 237-7838, or mail them to The

THE CUTTING EDGE / COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; IN DEVELOPMENT; 'MORE 
HUMAN' ROBOT LENDS A HAND CHEAPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WEIGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

 Robots are touted as better than humans at certain repetitive tasks, such as 
picking up objects and placing them elsewhere with extremely high degrees of 
accuracy. But not everyone needs a $70,000 piece of robotic machinery or the 
accuracy that such a sum buys. Enter the "intelligent integrated belt 
manipulator," which researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology hope 
will do for the robotics industry what the PC has done for the computer 
industry. By lowering the cost of a robot to about $20,000 and making it simple 
for non-engineers to operate, the researchers hope their "more human" robot 
will make the adoption of robotics more cost-effective for some industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Georgia Tech system uses a computer algorithm to determine the position of 
an object on a conveyor belt, based on the information provided by five 
low-cost photocells. By knowing when the object on the belt blocks the light of 
each photocell, the computer can determine the object's shape and location on 
the belt with enough accuracy for the robotic arm to find it. This eliminates 
the need for an expensive machine vision system. 
</P>
<P>
 The robot's "hand" consists of four inflatable fingers, each of which is like 
a rubber bellows. The bellows expands around and sometimes under the object to 
grip it securely and with enough accuracy and speed for many mundane tasks. The 
robot was originally designed for the poultry industry to pick up chicken legs, 
thighs and breasts from a conveyor belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Organics on Display: U.S. researchers continue to work on new technologies 
that might one day form the basis of a domestic industry for producing 
flat-panel displays, the versatile screens used in portable computers and 
various military applications. Now AT&T Bell Laboratories reports it has made 
significant progress in a new field of electronics that uses organic 
semiconductors to emit light. 
</P>
<P>
 Semiconductors are usually made from silicon, an inorganic element. Organic 
substances, which always include carbon, can be deposited onto a glass 
substrate, which is easier and cheaper than growing inorganic materials. Using 
a single organic electroluminescent called ALQ, a compound patented by Eastman 
Kodak Co., Bell Labs has produced miniature light-emitting diodes on glass that 
generate the primary colors of red, green and blue. The technology would make 
it unnecessary to go through the difficult and expensive process of integrating 
the patterns of three distinct chemicals to produce full-color displays. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers hope they will one day be able to compete with active-matrix 
liquid-crystal displays, a technology now dominated by Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Biological Band-Aids: Perhaps the oldest healing aid in the doctor's bag is 
the lowly bandage. Its purpose is simple: to shield a wound from bacteria and 
hold helpful medicines close to the skin. But researchers at Case Western 
Reserve University in Cleveland have a bandage they believe will actively 
assist in healing. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the techniques of molecular biology, Richard Eckert, an associate 
professor of physiology and biophysics at Case Western, came up with 
genetically engineered cells that overproduce a protein manufactured naturally 
by the body. It is these cells that release growth factors, which in turn 
trigger a host of skin-repair functions.

 The Genetically Engineered Biological Bandage is a plastic envelope containing 
growth-factor-producing cells. When applied, GEBB stimulates the body's 
skin-repair mechanisms to heal a wound more quickly. The bandage must be 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration and would not reach the market for

 Old Technology, New Tricks: The search for technology to reduce gasoline 
consumption and cut carbon dioxide emissions has come around to a common 
automobile fixture: the venerable flywheel. In a conventional automobile, the 
flywheel's purpose is to store kinetic energy and release it when needed, thus 
keeping the engine running smoothly. But flywheels can also be used to create 
batteries for the hybrid cars being developed that use both electricity and 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory recently 
entered into a $3-million agreement to see if flywheel batteries can replace 
chemical batteries in these autos. In hybrid vehicles, chemical batteries must 
be replaced frequently because they are constantly charged and discharged. 
Flywheel batteries can be charged and discharged endlessly at very high rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The battery's purpose is to capture and store energy now dissipated during 
braking, energy that could then be used to power quick accelerations without 
using extra gas. KATHLEEN WEIGNER

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE / COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; ACCOUNTING PROGRAM IS GEARED TO OWNERS OF VERY SMALL BUSINESSES

<P>
 Can you have a real business accounting program without those two dreaded 
words, debit and credit ? 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find either one in the index to the users manual for One-Write Plus 
4.0, a $70 program aimed at very small businesses. All the debits and credits 
of a proper double-entry accounting system are built into the program -- even 
if you don't have to know one from the other to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is published by NEBS Software Inc. of Nashua, N.H., runs 
under the DOS operating system on IBM-compatible personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Chuck McGonagle, senior product manager, One-Write Plus provides 
a more rigorous audit trail than Intuit's Quick Books, a market leader in 
small-business accounting software. In addition, he says, it is easier for 
people with little or no knowledge of accounting procedures to get started with 
this program than with those from Peachtree and DacEasy that can handle larger 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In its fourth major revision since it was introduced in 1985, One-Write Plus 
has all the basic accounting functions needed by a small business, including 
accounts payable, accounts receivable, invoicing, payroll and general ledger. 
It produces more than 40 reports and prints checks, invoices, statements, W-2s 
and 1099s. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it can theoretically handle a business with up to 500 employees and a 
general ledger balance up to $999 million, more than 90% of its users have 
sales of less than $1 million a year, according to McGonagle. 
</P>
<P>
 The real audience for this program is small businesses that currently use 
manual bookkeeping systems. One popular manual system, known as the peg board 
or one-write system, provided the program its name and one of its most 
distinctive features. 
</P>
<P>
 In a peg board system, a bookkeeper is able to simultaneously write checks and 
make check register entries by using special checks with carbon strips on the 
back and a peg board to position each check accurately on the register. 
</P>
<P>
 In One-Write Plus, the check register is displayed on the same screen as the 
check-writing form, and you can always see your account balance when you write 
a check. Of course, the advantage of computerized accounting is that all 
information is entered only once and then automatically distributed everywhere 
it needs to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That distribution is governed by the chart of accounts. Setting up a chart of 
accounts is the critical first step to any accounting system and one that 
usually requires a good understanding of accounting practices to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 One-Write Plus comes with pre-defined charts of accounts for 14 types of 
businesses and organizations. You can get started merely by choosing the set 
appropriate for your operations. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor of mine who has used the previous version of One-Write Plus to keep 
books for a small floor-covering company gives it high marks. She finds it easy 
to void erroneous entries, and she praised its payroll functions and bank 
account reconciliation feature. It is also easy to generate a sales report for 
each salesperson, which the company finds handy in deciding who should call 
slow-paying customers to ask for their check. 
</P>
<P>
 Version 4.0 is a major advance over previous versions. You can now use a mouse 
to navigate the menus and functions and you can run it from Windows. But it is 
still a DOS program. And that can cause difficulties for a business that has 
adopted Windows applications for the rest of its computing needs, such as 
word-processing, spreadsheet and database functions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Windows version of the program is now being written, but "it's taking a lot 
longer than we'd like," McGonagle said. The company is grappling with problems 
such as retaining the ability to do everything from the keyboard rather than 
having to use the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Version 4.0 features a new menu screen, navigated easily by mouse or keyboard, 
that takes you into the various forms and functions of the program. Once you 
leave the main menu, the program takes on a different look. The menu structure 
disappears and is replaced with function buttons, generally at the top of the 
screen, which provide quick access to functions such as "save" and "help." They 
can be invoked either with the mouse or keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's unfortunate that the button placement is often opposite where you 
would find the same function in a Windows program, but McGonagle said the 
placement generally matches the previous version of One-Write Plus. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its accounting functions, One-Write Plus has a feature called 
SuperTrack that lets you define three kinds of "card" files for organizing 
information, such as inventory, job costing and client-escrow funds. The cards 
work in conjunction with the regular program functions, so you can easily 
transfer information to them at the same time you write a check or record an 
invoice or receipt. 
</P>
<P>
 Check forms, invoices, receipts and all the other forms that need to be 
printed are available from various sources for all of the popular accounting 
programs. But One-Write Plus users can order their forms directly from the 
parent company of the program's publisher, New England Business Service Inc., a 
major supplier of business and computer forms.

TALKS IN TRANSIT STRIKE RESUME; OFFICIALS WARY; LABOR: SHARP DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN MECHANICS, MTA MAY PROLONG WALKOUT. CONGESTION ON FREEWAYS WORSENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Striking mechanics and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority resumed talks 
Tuesday evening as Los Angeles County commuters slowly made their way through 
town on the second day of a transit walkout that seemed destined to drag on for 
several more days. 
</P>
<P>
 Congestion worsened on the freeways as more commuters abandoned any hope of 
hailing a bus and flocked to cars. With less than 20% of MTA buses on the road, 
the small number of riders who braved the buses found tight seating, long 
delays -- and in some cases no bus at all, due to foul-ups in scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 While leaders of the mechanics union and MTA negotiators agreed to meet, 
officials were cautious about prospects for a quick settlement, aware of sharp 
differences between management and labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope we can make some progress," said County Supervisor Ed Edelman, MTA 
board chairman. "We are still far apart." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,900 mechanics walked off the job Sunday morning after they were unable 
to reach agreement on a new contract. About 5,000 bus and train drivers and 
clerks, whose unions had reached last-minute tentative agreements Sunday, 
walked out in support, crippling a system that serves more than 500,000 riders 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 2 of Los Angeles' first bus strike in 12 years: 
</P>
<P>
 * Traffic on surface streets remained at its usual levels, but congestion 
increased on Los Angeles area freeways. The average commute was increased by 
about 15 minutes and rush hour lasted about 30 minutes longer than usual, 
Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said. Metrolink commuter trains carried 
an estimated 20% more passengers, but ridership on the Blue Line trolley and 
the Red Line subway decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only 318 buses out of the normal 1,900 were in service. The MTA said it was 
providing service on its 30 busiest routes, but failed to tell riders that in 
many cases the buses were serving only portions of the line, leaving some 
would-be passengers stranded. The busiest lines were the No. 21, which runs 
along Wilshire Boulevard, and the No. 30/31 on Pico Boulevard, MTA spokeswoman 
Andrea Greene said. The agency has no plans to reshape its deployment of buses 
during the strike this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * MTA officials planned to launch a new commuter phone service because a 
transit hot line was unable to handle the flood of calls. Of an estimated 
15,000 calls received Monday by (800) COMMUTE, only 6,000 were answered, Greene 
said. The rest of the callers hung up after being put on hold for extended 
periods of time, and the hot line went out of service for 45 minutes Monday. 
The new phone service, scheduled to begin later this week, will provide 
recorded information. 
</P>
<P>
 * MTA supervisors drove 130 of the 318 buses on the road Tuesday. They had 
taken a refresher course in the weeks before the strike. The rest of the fleet 
was composed of private school buses, contracted by the MTA. Negotiations are 
under way with private companies to expand bus service should the strike extend 
beyond this week. The agency has received more than 1,700 applications in 
response to advertisements placed three weeks ago for temporary strike-related 
jobs. In two weeks, the agency expects to put 50 more drivers on the street if 
the strike persists. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transit officials tripled security patrols of the buses and bus stops after 
an attempted hijacking of a bus by three irate strikers was thwarted on Monday. 
In the only reported act of vandalism, a non-striking driver suffered a minor 
injury when a rock shattered his windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the public relations war, the MTA resumed newspaper and radio ads 
accusing the mechanics of holding the city hostage, but said it would suspend 
the ads once negotiations began. The ad campaign so far has cost taxpayers 
$198,632. The Politics of the Strike 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night's negotiating session -- the first since talks broke down Sunday 
-- was set up by a phone call from Jim Wood, secretary-treasurer of the County 
Federation of Labor, to Edelman, a longtime ally of labor. It was attended by a 
state mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 In the delicate negotiations between the transit agency and the unions, the 
path to a settlement is obstructed by layers of politics on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The key issue in the dispute -- even among the MTA's own board members -- is 
the subcontracting of work now performed by union mechanics to non-union 
private companies that pay lower wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy stems from differing philosophies: Promoted at the national 
level by then-President Ronald Reagan, "contracting out" of government services 
is a longtime Republican cost-cutting staple that has also gained support from 
budget-conscious Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders, on the other hand, see contracting as a threat to their 
survival; they contend that it lowers the number of higher-paying union jobs, 
threatens their members' job security and depresses wages for all workers. In 
the auto industry, for example, a key contract stumbling block in recent years 
has been demands by the nation's major auto makers to buy many car parts from 
cheaper, non-union suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Contracting has been a hot political issue in transportation in Los Angeles 
since 1988, when the now-defunct Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 
turned over bus lines previously operated by the old Southern California Rapid 
Transit District to Foothill Transit. Foothill, which pays far lower wages to 
its drivers, has asked the MTA to let it take over another 12 lines now 
operated by MTA, promising $10 million in savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The push for contracting gained momentum with the election of Mayor Richard 
Riordan, a Republican who has championed privatization, to replace Tom Bradley, 
a pro-union Democrat. Riordan is a member of the MTA board and appoints three 
other members. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Edelman and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, both Democrats, said that 
contracting must be considered in the current economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can provide better quality service and less costly service, and not 
jeopardize any jobs and it's served the public's interest, why should we be 
precluded from considering (contracting)?" Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood of the County Federation of Labor called efforts by MTA board members to 
contract out work "an excuse to attempt to move work out of the public sector 
and move it to their friends in the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
 So entrenched is the dispute that both sides have argued their point with a 
common symbol: the dustpan. 
</P>
<P>
 In citing the cost savings of contracting, transit officials have repeatedly 
said it only costs $9 at a neighborhood store to buy a dustpan that costs the 
union mechanics $25 to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood answers: "We can show you dustpans we made 30 years ago that are still in 
service. This is the kind of disinformation that management puts out to try to 
belittle what we do." He said the cheaper dustpans may have been made abroad by 
workers paid sub-minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bujosa, president of the local chapter of the Amalgamated Transit Union, 
representing 1,900 mechanics whose top hourly wage is $20.83, called 
subcontracting the major issue separating the union and the transit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where we are miles apart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are several other issues that may be hardening Bujosa's 
position, insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
 One occurred July 16 when, with negotiations under way, the MTA laid off 83 
mechanics -- a fact that has caused union members to question the MTA's pledge 
that no mechanics will lose jobs because of subcontracting. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials justified the timing of the layoffs by saying they are under 
fire and face a $300-million shortfall as a result of a recession-triggered 
decline in sales tax revenue. The layoffs of union and non-union employees had 
"nothing to do with labor negotiations; it had to do with cost reduction," MTA 
spokeswoman Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one source close to the negotiations said the layoff of mechanics was 
the primary reason the strike occurred. "That really was the dynamic that put 
them in the position where they almost literally couldn't justify doing 
otherwise," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bujosa, chapter president for the last three years, will be up for reelection 
this November, and needed to take a tough stand in response to the layoffs in 
order to win another term, some sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Bujosa disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to come up with a good contract, let's face it. But even if I'm not 
elected, I want to come back to a good job," he said. On the Street 
</P>
<P>
 With varying degrees of success, MTA officials tried to diminish the snafus 
Tuesday from their makeshift bus operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But glitches abounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Many passengers unaware of the new strike fare of 50 cents on MTA buses, 
deposited the customary $1.10. On the No. 21 Wilshire Boulevard line, four 
buses converged at one bus stop during the morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere the problem was the dearth of buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 16 line that normally links Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at 3rd Street 
and San Vicente Boulevard near Beverly Hills with Downtown was supposed to be 
up and running on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, service on the line was limited to the one-third of the route nearest 
to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Luisa Abeniante was one of the unlucky eastbound riders counting on a ride 
from a stop near the beginning of the usual route. A co-worker at the Medical 
Center of North Hollywood, where she is a nurse's assistant, had dropped her 
off at the 3rd Street and La Cienega Boulevard stop at 8 a.m. after she had 
worked all night and was trying to get to her home near Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour, with no bus in sight, she began to get frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "By this time I'm already home and I could do some things and sleep a little 
bit more," she said. The ride to work had taken her three hours and had made it 
a long day. She ended up walking until she found a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard another Line 16 bus later in the morning, a light crowd of riders were 
politely thanking the substitute driver, admiring the cleanliness of the bus 
and appreciating the MTA's no-fare policy on the school buses. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5th and Main streets, a group of picketers yelled, "Scab! Scab! Scab!" at 
the driver as he passed. A few blocks later, a picketer yelled, "Don't take 
that bus! Get off it or you're going to get killed!" 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the driver, who declined to give his name, said the picketers bothered 
him and made him fearful. But, he said, the aggravation is only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the city, others found ways to cope with the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at EZ Sportswear, a Chatsworth garment manufacturer, started 
worrying about the bus strike last week. About one-third of the company's 225 
employees ride the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to figure out how to get people to work," said Terry Miller, director 
of human resources. "So we arranged for employees with cars to bring the other 
people. We had people late, but we haven't had any absences." 
</P>
<P>
 At Handy J Carwash in Sherman Oaks, owner Joel Gassman said the strike cut his 
work force by more than half on Monday, with 14 workers absent from a crew of 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's making things very difficult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the McDonald's at Crenshaw Avenue and 71st Street, one-fifth of the work 
crew has been missing for the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Andrea Bailey hurried past. How was the strike affecting business? She 
threw up her hands. "Horrible! Horrible!" she said, rushing behind the counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Richard Lee Colvin, Nicholas Riccardi and Sam Enriquez 
contributed to this story. The MTA Strike: Day 2 
</P>
<P>
 The region's first transit strike in 12 years began at 12:01 a.m. Monday. Here 
is a look at Day 2: 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ISSUE: Dispute between the Amalgamated Transit Union, representing 1,900 
mechanics and service attendants, and the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. About 5,000 bus and train drivers and clerks are honoring picket 
lines. The major sticking point is the MTA's demand to contract out work. Union 
members say they believe that it will eliminate jobs and result in poorer 
quality work. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE STATUS: Negotiations resumed Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT'S OPERATING: About 300 buses on portions of the 30 busiest routes, out 
of the usual 1,900 buses on 200 routes. Some routes will use school buses, 
operated by private drivers, identified by "M" logos in the front and back. 
Service is continuing on the Red Line, Amtrak, Metrolink commuter rail and 
municipal/private operators such as Foothill Transit, L.A. tcity commuter 
express and DASH. The Blue Line is offering limited service. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ROUTES: 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is offering regular service on these routes:  
</P>
<P>
 204 Vermont Ave., 240 Reseda Blvd.; 424 Ventura Blvd.-L.A.; and 442 
Hawthorne-Manchester-Express and on the Red Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the following routes are being served:  
</P>
<P>
 1/217 Hollywood Blvd.-Fairfax Ave.; 16 West 3rd St.; 18 E. Whittier Blvd.-West 
6th St.; 21 Wilshire Blvd.; 30 Pico Blvd.-East 1st St.; 33 Venice Blvd.; 45 
Broadway; 76 Valley Blvd.; 81 Figueroa St.; 92 Glenoaks Blvd.-Brand Blvd.; 105 
Vernon Ave.; 108 Slauson Ave.; 115 Manchester Blvd.-Firestone Blvd.; 117 
Century Blvd.; 125 Rosecrans Ave.; 152 Roscoe Blvd.; 163 Sherman Way; 180 
Hollywood-Glendale-Pasadena; 207 Western Ave.; 210 Crenshaw Blvd.; 212 La 
Brea-S.F. Valley; 251 Soto St.; 260 Atlantic Ave.; 420 San Vernando 
Valley-Hollywood-L.A.; 470 Whittier-Montebello-L.A.; 560 Van Nuys 
Blvd.-Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Line route runs between Willow station in Long Beach and 7th/Metro 
station only. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOURS: Bus and train service is from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays only. 
</P>
<P>
 * FARES: 50 cents on MTA buses and Blue Line, with no transfers. Elderly and 
the disabled pay 25 cents. No fee on the emergency school buses. 
</P>
<P>
 * FOR MORE INFORMATION: (800) COMMUTE or (800) 371-LINK (for Metrolink 
information.) A new line for recorded information will be added later this 
week.

2 KILLED IN EXPLOSION AT ROCKETDYNE IN SIMI HILLS; TEST SITE: A THIRD MAN IS 
SERIOUSLY HURT. THE BLAST, SET OFF DURING WORK WITH ROCKET FUEL, STARTS 15-ACRE 
BRUSH FIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were killed and a third was seriously injured Tuesday morning when a 
massive chemical explosion ripped through a rocket engine test site on a rugged 
plateau in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9:13 a.m. blast at Rockwell International's Rocketdyne Division plant -- 
so powerful that some nearby residents mistook it for an earthquake -- did not 
ignite any buildings on the guarded, 2,700-acre facility. 
</P>
<P>
 It did, however, touch off a brush fire in the boulder-strewn chaparral 
surrounding the plant. The fire blackened 15 acres and was extinguished in an 
hour, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the blast at the 47-year-old lab was not immediately clear, and 
an investigation by fire officials and workplace safety investigators 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell spokesman Paul Sewell said the two Rockwell engineers who were killed 
were preparing a controlled burn of a catalyst used in solid fuel rocket motors 
on an outdoor test stand when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, who are believed to have died instantly, were identified as Larry 
A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks, and Otto K. Heiney, 53, of Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were co-workers, these were friends and people we all knew very well," 
Sewell said. "And we tremendously hate to see them lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The injured worker, Lee Wells, 62, of Newbury Park, was taken to Simi Valley 
Hospital, and later taken by helicopter to the Burn Center at Sherman Oaks 
Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells, a chief test mechanic for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, suffered 
second- and third-degree burns over 20% of his body, with high-intensity 
explosive burns on the left side of his head, neck and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was blown back five feet and he hit the hill," said Dr. Richard 
Grossman, director of the burn center. "He has cuts on his face. It was 
probably from some kind of metal." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said Wells, a 32-year Rockwell employee, had worked for 15 years with 
the two men who were killed. Two other workers, who also were not identified, 
escaped injury in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rocketdyne facility -- which sprawls over an area so rugged that it has 
been used as a backdrop for Westerns -- lies about 30 miles northwest of 
Downtown Los Angeles. It is perhaps best known as a rocket engine test site for 
the U.S. Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, but 
nuclear research also has been done there. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the Santa Susana Field Laboratory -- or "Santa Sue," in company 
parlance -- the facility has been in operation since 1947, when it was opened 
by Rocketdyne's predecessor, North American Aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Its first mission was to dismantle and analyze a V-2 rocket like those the 
Germans had used to terrorize England during World War II. Since then, its 
employees, which currently number 742, have tested engines for virtually every 
U.S. rocket program, including the space shuttle and the first manned flight to 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Current work includes testing of Atlas and Delta rocket engines that propel 
communications satellites into space. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety has long been a concern at the plant, but other incidents there have 
chiefly involved problems with nuclear testing and environmental contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in 1959 -- in the early years of a nuclear research project that 
lasted through the 1980s -- there was a partial meltdown of a small nuclear 
test reactor at the facility. Company officials later said the incident posed 
no danger to workers or the public. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1989, public disclosure of lingering, low-level contamination from past 
nuclear projects prompted a public furor that led Rocketdyne to halt nuclear 
research at the site the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the energy research area of the site, the Department of Energy is funding a 
multimillion-dollar cleanup of buildings, soil and ground water tainted by 
chemicals and radiation. And in the rocket testing area, Rocketdyne is engaged 
in a long-term cleanup of ground water contaminated with chemical solvents used 
to rinse rocket engines. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday's accident is believed to be the first involving fatalities in the 
plant's history, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sewell, the experiment that set off the explosion involved 10 
pounds of glycidal azide polymer and nitrocellulose, chemicals used to enhance 
the ignition of solid and liquid propellants in rocket engines. The material 
was to be tested to determine its characteristics so it could be properly 
packaged, labeled and transported, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, the test explosion would be triggered electronically by 
technicians standing a safe distance away, Sewell said. He added that he did 
not know how far the victims were from the source of the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all near the (test stand) when the accident occurred," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell said the accident is being investigated by Rockwell, Cal/OSHA and 
Ventura County fire officials. Ventura County sheriff's officials said that the 
U.S. Air Force also was involved in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to find out the cause of the accident," Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the plant's private fire department responded, but other agencies 
were called for assistance when the explosion ignited brush in the surrounding 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze was put out by firefighters from Ventura and Los Angeles counties, 
along with Rocketdyne firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, nearby homeowners spent the morning wondering what had happened. At 
the Summit mobile home park on Woolsey Canyon Road, down the hill from the lab 
site, several residents said they thought the explosion was an earthquake 
because it had so shaken their walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard a boom and the windows rattled a bit," said Melissa Barros, 32, who 
was staying with her sister in a double-wide mobile home overlooking the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, Barbara Cole said she heard a "little pop" and thought it was 
an aftershock or the heat bending her metal awning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw helicopters and thought they must be looking for something," she said. 
"But there's always helicopters and planes flying over. I never thought it was 
Rocketdyne." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the mobile home residents saw smoke from the small brush fire, but 
Kurt Horstman, 30, said he noticed an acrid smell shortly after the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did smell pretty bad, but that's about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>

and correspondents Julie Fields and Scott Hadly contributed to this story.

REPORT SAYS FAA MAY HAVE LAGGED ON 757 WAKE PERIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration may have mishandled reports on turbulence 
problems associated with Boeing 757s because it doesn't have the proper 
procedures to ensure that safety concerns are acted upon in a timely fashion, 
according to a federal report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-page report, a joint effort by the FAA and the Department of 
Transportation, concluded that some officials within the FAA believe the agency 
could have acted sooner in taking steps designed to prevent accidents caused by 
wake turbulence from Boeing 757s. Others in the agency, however, do not share 
that view, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the conflicting views on whether the agency mishandled the issue of 
757 wake turbulence -- a phenomenon that has been linked to two fatal airplane 
crashes -- the panel assembled by U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena 
and FAA Administrator David R. Hinson found a consensus within the FAA that the 
agency's ability to spot potential safety threats and take appropriate action 
is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The B-757 wake vortex episode should serve as a wake-up call to the FAA to 
re-examine its processes for addressing emerging safety issues promptly and 
effectively," wrote the two officials who headed the review team, 
Transportation Department General Counsel Stephen H. Kaplan and Deputy FAA 
Administrator Linda Hall Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the report maintained that the FAA has an "unparalleled" safety 
record, it sent a clear message -- as well as a list of recommendations -- to 
Hinson and Pena that the agency could do better. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle said during a discussion of the report that bureaucracy and a lack of 
leadership and clout have compromised the efficacy of the Office of Aviation 
Safety, whose job it is to identify, analyze and otherwise call attention to 
safety-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena and Hinson ordered the review in mid-June after a series of reports in 
The Times indicated that the FAA knew about the potential danger of 757 wake 
turbulence long before two crashes that claimed 13 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Caused by the rapid movement of air across aircraft wings, wake turbulence 
amounts to a pair of "horizontal tornadoes" emanating from each wingtip. 
Although aviation experts disagree on the level of danger, some believe that 
the sleek wing and body design of the fuel-efficient 757 can cause wake 
turbulence that is more powerful and lasts longer than that created by other 
aircraft of comparable size. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on FAA internal documents and aviation safety sources, The Times 
reported June 5 that the FAA's top scientist repeatedly expressed concerns 
about 757 wake turbulence, and in December, 1992, warned that it could be 
lethal and might cause a "major crash" if the agency failed to act. On Dec. 18, 
1992, eleven days after Robert E. Machol's prediction, a crash did occur in 
Billings, Mont., killing eight people. In December, 1993, five people died in 
Santa Ana after a corporate jet encountered the wake from a 757 on approach to 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to recommendations made in February by the National Transportation 
Safety Board, the FAA last month instituted a new set of policies governing 
smaller planes landing and taking off behind 757s, including an extra mile of 
spacing on final approach. The agency also has embarked on an aggressive 
program to educate pilots and air traffic controllers about the potential 757 
wake turbulence hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 A congressional subcommittee is scheduled to take up the specific issue of 
whether the FAA tarried too long before acting on 757 wake turbulence concerns, 
as well as the general topic of whether the people who detect potential safety 
problems within the FAA communicate effectively with the agency's policy-makers 
and decision-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, the FAA and Transportation Department were unwavering in the 
opinion that nothing the FAA could have done would have prevented the Billings 
crash. Safety investigators have concluded that the pilot in that accident was 
operating under visual flight rules, meaning it was up to him to maintain a 
safe distance behind the 757 he was tailing. Other aviation safety officials 
have suggested, however, that had the FAA called attention to the potential 757 
turbulence hazard earlier, the Billings pilot might have been more prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the safety board has not finished its investigation of the Santa Ana 
crash, the report did not speculate whether the FAA could have affected the 
outcome of that crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the pilot in the ill-fated Billings accident, the pilot in the Santa Ana 
crash was operating under visual flight rules. He, too, had inadvertently 
strayed too close to the 757 and dropped below the flight path of the 757, 
which made his smaller plane more susceptible to the wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel that compiled Tuesday's report recommended that the FAA: 
</P>
<P>
 * Review the role of the Office of Aviation Safety and create a more effective 
mechanism to address safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency lacks "a single organization, mechanism or entity" that can 
identify potential safety problems, alert others within the agency and follow 
up on safety recommendations, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take a more proactive approach when it comes to communicating potential 
safety hazards to pilots, air traffic controllers or others in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Better define who's responsible for what within the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improve research and development, including that involving wake turbulence.

REFUGEES GET STEADY DIET OF PROPAGANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deep inside this pestilential camp, where 300,000 Rwandan refugees struggle in 
a living nightmare, Alphonse Putsingile sat back Tuesday in a spacious 
compound, protected by young toughs and high walls topped with shards of broken 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 He has trucks, food and water, and a barefoot man squatted nearby pressing 
pants with an iron filled with hot coals. The agonizing death and disease 
outside seemed far away for the once-powerful local government leader of 
Rwerere district in northwestern Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Putsingile insisted that none of the refugees should leave. "The people will 
be all killed if they go home," he said. "So it is better to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
 But time is running out. Aid officials say the estimated 1.2 million Rwandan 
refugees now facing the agony of Zaire's border camps have about two weeks to 
go home and harvest the bursting fields of corn, beans and other crops that 
carpet the lush country. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the crops will start to rot and the refugees won't be able to 
return unless they are given emergency supplies inside Rwanda, dramatically 
expanding the already overwhelmed international aid effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have to do another massive aid effort," said Ray Wilkinson, spokesman 
for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the hungry refugees are fed a steady diet of fear and propaganda by former 
Hutu government officials and their minions, who insist they will be tortured 
and killed if they return to Rwanda. They claim that the estimated 30,000 
refugees who have crossed the border since Sunday are dead, although 
journalists and other witnesses have seen them walking home safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Hutu government fled here July 15 before the advancing rebel army 
of the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front. Now out of power, the exiled leaders 
apparently have decided to use whatever means possible to keep the Hutus here 
as political bargaining chips, despite the horrors of a widening cholera 
epidemic and desperate shortages of food and water. 
</P>
<P>
 So rumors and threats circulate daily from members of the former regime's 
murderous militias and the Interahamwe, the armed youth wing of the government 
party. Together, they are considered most responsible for the slaughter of 
hundreds of thousands of Tutsis since April 6, a carnage fueled by venomous 
government radio broadcasts that demonized the Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 Their propaganda machine is in full swing again. Many refugees insist, for 
example, that the Tutsis caused the cholera epidemic by poisoning the water. 
And nearly all are convinced they will be mutilated or killed by the new regime 
if they go home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard all the refugees (who went back) have no eyes anymore," 
28-year-old Primitiv Mukandemzo warned outside the plastic-covered lean-to 
where her family sleeps on reed mats. 
</P>
<P>
 Frediana Mukamunana, 54, using her finger to slash in the air as she spoke, 
shouted: "They cut out the heart, the eyes and the intestines! And they put 
people in cars and burn them!" 
</P>
<P>
 "They will put us in houses and burn us," whispered 18-year-old Faustin 
Ntanshuti. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that the United Nations had announced the country was safe for returnees 
and that reporters had seen thousands of refugees walking home this week 
without problems, Josephin Mukamabano only laughed. "They surely are killing 
people after you leave," she said, tending a small cooking fire beside her 
grass-covered hut. "We are told the bodies are buried immediately so 
journalists can't see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Educated Rwandans are just as terrified. "They will kill all the 
intellectuals," said Alphonse Harerimana, a physician working at the Doctors 
Without Borders tent hospital for cholera cases. "Only the illiterate will 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Rwandan medical worker rushed up and interrupted. "I just heard that 
all the refugees who went back were killed," he said excitedly. "People came 
and told us." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, a group of young Rwandan men shouted down a reporter who explained 
to several old women that it was safe to return. "You're telling lies!" they 
shouted angrily. "It is not possible. Those who went yesterday were all killed 
yesterday!" 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilkinson of the U.N. refugee agency said not a single returnee is known 
to have been injured or killed by soldiers of the new regime. "All the 
indications we've got is things are very stable there and the people who have 
gone back have had absolutely no problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He criticized the militia members and others in the camps for spreading rumors 
and said the United Nations is fighting "a battle for the hearts and minds" of 
the refugees. So far, he added, the militias are winning. "They are obviously 
very, very active in trying to persuade and coerce people not to go back," he 
said. "These people have become pawns in a major game of Russian roulette, with 
hundreds of thousands of lives at stake. It's as cynical as you can get." 
</P>
<P>
 But criticism also has grown of the U.N. refugee agency. Although it announced 
Friday that it would encourage and help refugees to return, it has not used 
radio, sound trucks or any other means to tell those in the disease-ridden 
camps that it is safe to leave. Wilkinson said the United Nations is so far 
relying on "word of mouth" instead. "It works in Africa," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although many refugees insist they will go back only if accompanied by 
U.N. officials, Wilkinson said the agency has no immediate plans to transport 
or provide protection for returning refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions here remain miserable. Doctors counted about 600 decomposing bodies 
of apparent cholera victims in the camp Tuesday morning before burial trucks 
could pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the corpses lay only a few feet from where vegetable sellers 
sat calmly displaying their produce on tattered bits of plastic. A few other 
bodies, abandoned by the road, were run over by passing cars.

AS RABIN, HUSSEIN CELEBRATE PACT, MIDEAST FOCUS SHIFTS; DIPLOMACY: CLINTON 
PLEDGES TO REWARD 'RISKS' BY OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. HE MENTIONS SYRIA 
SPECIFICALLY. 
</P>

<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein took a victory 
lap through Congress and the White House on Tuesday to celebrate the end of 
hostility between their countries. But the harsh realities of the Middle East 
quickly changed the focus to continuing disputes such as those between Israel 
and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing between Rabin and Hussein at a White House news conference, President 
Clinton pledged American support to countries that "take risks for peace," a 
formula that translates into financial relief now for Jordan and future 
diplomatic rewards for Syria if Damascus makes peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spoke yesterday with President (Hafez) Assad of Syria to reaffirm my 
personal dedication to achieving a comprehensive peace," Clinton said. He said 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will resume his Damascus-Jerusalem 
shuttle diplomacy soon. 
</P>
<P>
 American and Israeli officials were encouraged by Assad's decision to let 
Syria's government-operated television provide live broadcasts of the 
Rabin-Hussein ceremonies, a sharp contrast with its usual practice of 
mentioning Israel only in harshly critical terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Mordechai Gur, Israel's deputy defense minister and a close associate of 
Rabin's, said the broadcast may be the first step in a campaign to prepare 
Syrian public opinion for eventual peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 During almost three years of negotiations, Assad has made it clear that he 
expects improved relations with the United States as a payoff if he reaches a 
settlement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that Washington is ready to reward any government that moves 
toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will support leaders whose boldness and wisdom are creating a new Middle 
East," the President said. "Today I have reaffirmed to Prime Minister Rabin 
that as Israel moves forward in the peace process, the constant responsibility 
of the United States will be to help ensure its security. I have also 
reaffirmed to King Hussein my determination to assist Jordan in dealing with 
its burden of debt and its defense requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan wants relief from its $700-million debt to the United States, and it 
wants new American weaponry to modernize its military. Clinton said he will 
confer with Congress "to achieve rapid action on both these matters." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of a car bomb explosion outside the Israeli Embassy in London on 
Tuesday, of Panamanian authorities' disclosure that a commuter plane crash that 
killed 21 people last week had been caused by a bomb and of last week's 
terrorist attack in Buenos Aires that killed 96, the news conference focused 
largely on terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, Rabin and Hussein agreed that recent violent incidents were intended 
to derail the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein denounced terrorists as "enemies of life, enemies of human relations 
between human beings, enemies of hope, enemies of security, enemies of what 
should be normal among people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing irritates me more or is more painful to me than to witness and see 
acts and attitudes attributed to Islam that have nothing to do with Islam, my 
faith and my religion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Rabin said that "extreme, radical Islamic terrorist movements 
(are waging) all-out war . . . against the possibility of the solution of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Rabin and Hussein addressed a rare joint meeting of Congress with 
speeches so similar in tone that they appeared to be mirror images. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men described themselves as former soldiers, each reminisced about a 
lifetime spent under the cloud of Arab-Israeli hostility, and both mourned 
those who died in wars between the neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I, who served my country for 27 years as a soldier, say to you . . . today we 
are embarking on a battle which has no dead and no wounded, no blood and no 
anguish," Rabin said. "This is the only battle which is a pleasure to wage: the 
battle for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Hussein said: "I come before you today as a soldier who seeks to 
bear arms solely in the defense of his homeland, a man who understands the 
fears of his neighbors and who wishes only to live in peace with them." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that two heads of government had addressed the lawmakers 
during the same session, and the speeches were interrupted repeatedly by 
vigorous applause. Perhaps the warmest ovation came after Hussein said simply, 
"Mr. Speaker, the state of war between Israel and Jordan is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two Semitic people, the Arabs and the Jews, have endured bitter trials 
and tribulations during the journey of history," he said. "I come before you 
today fully conscious of the need to secure a peace for all the children of 
Abraham." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin observed: "Walls of hostilities have been built on the River Jordan 
which runs between us. You in Amman and we in Jerusalem must bring down those 
barriers and walls, must solve those concrete problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein, seeming to blink back tears, nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasizing the shared geography of the two states carved out of the old 
British mandate of Palestine, Rabin said: "The Middle East that was a valley of 
the shadow of death will become a place where it is a pleasure to live. We live 
on the same stretch of land; the same rain nourishes our soil; the same hot 
wind parches our fields. We find shade under the same fig tree. We savor the 
fruit of the same green vine; we drink from the same well." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that a Jordanian leader had addressed Congress and the 
first time that an Arab head of state had spoken to a joint meeting since 
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1975. It was Rabin's second speech to a joint 
meeting of Congress, following one in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Both leaders referred repeatedly to religion and the common heritage of Jews, 
Muslims and Christians. As he neared the end of his speech, Rabin whipped a 
black yarmulke from his pocket and read a traditional benediction in Hebrew.

20 WHITE HOUSE CONTACTS WITH S&L PROBE TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS and SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler told a House Whitewater hearing Tuesday 
that at least a dozen White House aides had more than 20 questionable contacts 
with federal regulators about their investigation of a failed Arkansas savings 
and loan owned by an investment partner of then-Gov. Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the aides in some cases displayed poor judgment by conferring with 
the regulators more frequently than appeared to be proper, they violated no 
laws or ethical standards, Cutler told the House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been better if some of these contacts had never occurred," 
Cutler said of the meetings and phone conversations, which took place during a 
six-month period ending last February as the White House sought to develop a 
strategy for dealing with burgeoning media reports about the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler said that "there were too many people having too many discussions about 
too many sensitive matters." But at no point was "any effort made to influence" 
the decision of Treasury Department regulators to seek a criminal investigation 
into failure of the thrift and its possible connection to the Whitewater resort 
development, which was partly owned by Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The "worst" impropriety, Cutler said, was an effort by Bernard Nussbaum, who 
was then the White House counsel, to persuade Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger 
Altman to defer a decision to recuse himself from overseeing the Whitewater 
investigation last February, when the political appointee also was serving as 
acting head of the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it did "not violate any ethical standard . . . this discussion should 
not have taken place," Cutler said of the Feb. 2 White House meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum, who later resigned when word of the White House-Treasury contacts 
leaked, "should have encouraged Mr. Altman to recuse," Cutler added. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler's testimony offered the most detailed public accounting yet of the 
controversial contacts, which Clinton's GOP critics contend had a chilling 
effect on lower-level federal investigators. Those critics contend that the 
investigators believed that they were being pressured into slowing their 
investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, the failed thrift owned by 
the Clintons' Whitewater partner, James B. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 But in part because of an orchestrated series of leaks from the White House 
and its allies -- aimed at deflecting what could have been several embarrassing 
revelations by disclosing them beforehand -- the hearings offered no major 
surprises as they opened amid high partisan tension. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), the committee's chairman, wasted no time in 
displaying his distaste for the proceedings by denouncing the "innumerable, 
inflammatory and absolutely false claims" made by Republican critics of what he 
scornfully called "the so-called Whitewater affair." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, the committee's ranking Republican, conceded that the 
hearings, whose scope was confined to those aspects of Whitewater that special 
counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. has finished investigating, would be no ratings 
match for "the O.J. Simpson teleprobe." 
</P>
<P>
 But what will emerge, Leach contended, is a picture of "me-generation ethics," 
in which the Clinton Administration conspired with congressional Democrats to 
resist "full disclosure . . . and mislead the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater, Leach added, is "about the arrogance of power. It is a metaphor 
for privilege, for a government run by a new political class which takes short 
cuts to power with end-runs of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Already chafing under Democratic restrictions that put the meat of the 
Whitewater controversy off limits for now, the 20 Republicans on the 51-member 
panel were angered when Gonzalez moved to further limit the scope of the 
hearings by banning all questions about the suicide a year ago of Deputy White 
House Counsel Vincent Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Fiske has already ruled that Foster's death was a suicide that had 
nothing to do with Whitewater, Gonzalez said, "no public good would be served 
by a hearing on a subject that is clearly closed" and whose airing would only 
"further torment Mr. Foster's innocent family." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of a series of party-line ballots that ruled Republican questions 
out of order, the committee voted, 31 to 19, to set aside the matter of 
Foster's death, leaving only one narrow area of the complicated affair -- the 
White House contacts with the Treasury Department -- for the hearings to 
explore. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a strict five-minute time rule, which Gonzalez appeared to enforce 
more strictly for Republicans than for Democrats, the restrictions ignited 
frequent partisan flare-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing smells to high heaven," complained Rep. Toby Roth (R-Wis.). "If 
these ground rules applied to the O.J. Simpson trial, you couldn't ask about 
the knife, the glove or the blood. Under these ground rules all you could ask 
is: 'So, O.J., how was the flight to Chicago?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But if the increasingly testy partisanship proved to Republicans that the 
Democrats were trying to frustrate GOP attempts to get to the bottom of 
Whitewater, it also confirmed for Democrats that the Republicans were bent on 
turning the hearings into what several charged was a "political circus" to 
embarrass the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler was the opening session's only witness and the Republicans grilled him 
for nearly seven hours with hostile questions that, for the most part, were 
answered so calmly that the partisan tension turned to tedium as the day wore 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find this hearing to be boring," declared Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los 
Angeles) at one point. "Everything I've heard here today . . . I already read 
in the press." 
</P>
<P>
 That was not surprising because for the last two weeks the Clinton 
Administration and its Democratic allies in Congress have been leaking most of 
the disclosures that would have come out at the hearings in an effort to avoid 
the double embarrassment of having Republicans reveal them first. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by friendly questioning from Democrats, Cutler repeatedly testified that 
no laws or ethical standards were breached by what he described as a series of 
contacts intended mostly to keep the White House informed of media inquiries 
about Whitewater and to seek guidance on how to respond to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found no evidence of any attempt to cover up anything at all," Cutler said 
of a review of the contacts he conducted after being appointed in March by 
Clinton to straighten out the White House's chaotic handling of Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated Republicans -- who are under mounting pressure to produce something 
at these hearings or drop Whitewater as a political issue -- clearly hope to 
raise more doubts about the Administration's candor on Thursday, when Nussbaum, 
who is considered to be a more vulnerable witness, is scheduled to testify.

FOLEY OPEN TO EMPLOYER MANDATE CUT; HEALTH: SPEAKER SAYS HE WILL CONSIDER A 
BUSINESS CONTRIBUTION OF 50% OF PREMIUMS. MITCHELL STUDIES A SIMILAR MOVE, BUT 
IT IS UNCLEAR IF THE ACTION WOULD GAIN VOTES FOR REFORM. 
</P>

<P>
 Seeking compromise on the most controversial element of President Clinton's 
health care plan, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said Tuesday that he 
will not insist on employers paying 80% of workers' insurance premiums and 
instead is considering setting business contributions at 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's comments came as Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
also was exploring whether lowering the contribution to 50% might win some 
badly needed votes on his side of the Capitol. Mitchell's proposal, however, 
would not require any mandatory employer contribution until some date in the 
future and then only if voluntary health care reform measures had failed to 
provide coverage to a target level of 95% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's readiness to compromise indicates how difficult it will be to pass the 
80% requirement in either chamber. Most analysts had been saying the mandate 
appeared to have far better prospects in the House than in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The percentage of employer-employee contribution is one of the things that 
can be discussed," Foley told reporters. "Nothing there is written in stone." 
</P>
<P>
 The employer mandate is Clinton's chief means of reaching his goal of 
universal coverage. Except for a proposal that would have government take over 
the financing of health care, none of the alternatives being offered in 
Congress have found a way to achieve universal coverage without requiring 
employers to pay a share of the insurance for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 By lowering the required employer contribution, congressional leaders hope to 
pick up support from moderate to conservative Democrats and Republicans who 
believe that an 80% share would be too burdensome for businesses. It was far 
from clear Tuesday, however, whether dropping the mandatory share to 50% would 
pick up many votes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, reducing the employer share of premiums would place a 
greater financial burden on employees, which means that many workers at lower 
income levels would not be able to afford coverage unless the government 
provided generous subsidies at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Foley said he favors the 80-20 "division of responsibility," the 
Speaker noted pointedly that his home state of Washington has adopted a plan 
under which employers are required to pay at least 50% of insurance premiums. 
Nothing in any of the alternatives being discussed would prevent employers from 
contributing a greater share. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's comments came as a surprise to many Clinton allies in the House. The 
version of the Clinton bill being readied by House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) contains an 80% requirement, according to a preliminary draft 
obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some of those who support the Clinton plan express doubt that lowering the 
requirement will pick up any votes. With many members saying they will not 
support any mandate, "I'm not sure going to 50-50 is going to answer the 
objections," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee's health and environment subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it could be enormously expensive to lower the requirement. Such a 
move presumably would be accompanied by large government subsidies to help low- 
and moderate-income workers afford their share of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida Democrat Sam Gibbons, acting chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, warned pointedly that reducing the employer share from 80% to 50% 
would increase the cost of government-financed subsidies by $30 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 He, too, said such a move would not mollify opponents of mandates: "Those who 
are opposed to employer mandates at 80-20 are still opposed when it is 50-50." 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt's bill, which he hopes to unveil Friday, also would require 
individuals who do not have coverage through their employers to buy their own 
insurance and would provide government subsidies for that purpose to families 
with incomes up to $38,400 a year, according to the working document used by 
Gephardt in his Monday meeting with other House leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt fashioned the bill from two separate pieces of legislation that had 
been passed by the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Education and 
Labor Committee. Each contained highly controversial provisions. Gephardt 
closely followed the approach taken by the tax-writing Ways and Means 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The close resemblance between the Ways and Means and the Gephardt bills 
prompted one health care analyst to surmise that the lawmaker either believes 
that he has the votes to ram the employer mandate through the House -- almost 
certainly on a strictly party-line vote -- or that he has tried but failed to 
come up with another way to reach universal coverage without an employer 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite many new details contained in the Gephardt document, a number of key 
issues were not mentioned -- indicating that major issues remain unresolved, 
most notably a specific phase-in schedule for the employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gephardt bill would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Grant tax credits on a sliding scale to small businesses with 50 or fewer 
workers and a low average payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide full subsidies to individuals with incomes below the poverty level. 
Subsidies also would be granted on a sliding scale to those with incomes up to 
240% of the poverty threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create a Medicare Part C for those beyond the reach of an employer mandate, 
such as seasonal workers, low-income employees of small businesses and early 
retirees not yet eligible for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 * Require all employers to offer at least one traditional health plan, which 
does not limit consumer choice of providers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide for a standard benefits package, including long-term care and 
prescription drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow states to adopt a government-financed single-payer system, similar to 
one that is on the November ballot in California. It also would require 
purchasing cooperatives, through which individuals and small companies could 
get more clout in the health market by pooling their resources. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bar insurance companies from jacking up rates on those who develop costly 
illnesses and force insurers to take all applicants, even those with 
pre-existing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create a National Health Cost Commission that, by the year 2000, would 
recommend cost-containment measures to Congress that would automatically take 
effect unless rejected by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase by 45 cents per pack the current 24-cent federal cigarette tax. 
That is significantly less than the 75-cent hike recommended by Clinton.

MANY ELDERLY TOO MEDICATED, SURVEY FINDS 
</P>

<P>
 Confirming long-held suspicions about the over-drugging of the elderly, a 
Harvard University study has found that almost one-quarter of the United 
States' senior citizens -- 6.6 million people over age 65 -- are being 
prescribed drugs that have been deemed dangerous to the health of older people. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which appears in today's issue of the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn., marks the first time that researchers have been able to document 
the vast extent of the problem. Although previous studies have shed light on 
the practice of inappropriate medication in nursing homes, the Harvard study 
looked at elderly people living in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors found that in 1987, the most recent year for which statistics are 
available, 23.5% of older Americans received at least one "potentially 
inappropriate" drug based on a list of 20 medications that a panel of experts 
has concluded should be prescribed to the elderly only in the rarest of 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The research highlights what one expert termed "an epidemic of inappropriate, 
sub-optimal and excessive drug prescribing for older Americans" -- a problem 
the study authors say stems from gaps in doctors' knowledge about how drugs 
affect the elderly and aggressive marketing by drug companies. Experts, 
including the authors, said the research only scratches the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that at least half, probably two-thirds of older adults in this 
country are being prescribed a drug that is doing unnecessary harm to them and 
the toll is enormous," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's 
Health Research Group in Washington, which published a book on elderly drug use 
earlier this year. "The problem, as serious as it is stated in the JAMA paper, 
is actually much worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors who specialize in geriatrics say they routinely see evidence of 
over-drugging in their practices. Dr. Gary Small, a geriatric psychiatrist at 
UCLA, frequently advises other doctors whose elderly patients have illnesses 
that seem to bring about mental changes. Often, Small said, drugs are the 
culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can recall, when I first started out in this area, seeing a patient who had 
a diagnosis on admission to the hospital of Alzheimer's disease but was also 
taking 10 milligrams of Valium a day," Small said. "I discontinued the Valium 
and his mental impairment cleared up in a couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Valium, often prescribed as a sleeping pill, was one of the drugs 
cited in the JAMA article as being one of the most commonly prescribed 
medications that is dangerous to the elderly. Librium, another sedative, also 
was on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with these drugs, said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, an associate 
professor of internal medicine at Harvard and one of the study's authors, is 
that they do not wear off by morning. Senior citizens are left sleepy and 
confused, and therefore prone to falls and hip fractures. 
</P>
<P>
 Other drugs deemed dangerous for the elderly were Darvon and Darvocet, both 
addictive narcotics. The Harvard researchers said these drugs are no more 
effective than aspirin for pain and can cause seizures and heart problems in 
older people. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say there are other, safer, alternatives. For example, there are 
tranquilizers whose effects are shorter-lasting than those of Valium and 
Librium. And, Woolhandler said, some patients might not need drugs at all. 
Doctors, she said, need to make a greater effort at solving problems without 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to write a prescription," she said. "It's much more time-consuming 
to ask, 'Are you drinking too much coffee during the day? Are you getting 
enough exercise? Is something bothering you that is keeping you up at night?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Woolhandler blamed the over-drugging problem on aggressive marketing by drug 
companies, which spend an estimated $10 billion each year to advertise and 
promote new drugs, mostly through seminars and one-on-one sessions with 
doctors. She also blamed a lack of skepticism among physicians, who rely on the 
companies to educate them about how to use different medications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drug company salesmen are trying to convince physicians that for every 
human problem the answer is the latest new drug," she said. "So much money is 
spent on the miseducation of physicians by drug companies. Too little is spent 
on spreading real scientific information about drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, 
an industry trade group, countered that what drug companies tell doctors is 
highly regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, precisely to prevent 
manufacturers from misleading doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue here is making sure that physicians know about how to use 
medicines," spokesman Steve Bercham said. "We play a vital role in that. Who 
knows the drug better than the drug companies?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bercham also complained that the study is outdated because prescribing 
practices have changed since 1987 as doctors have become more attuned to the 
special needs of the elderly. But Woolhandler said she has no reason to believe 
that practices have changed dramatically since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Small, the UCLA doctor, said he frequently sees patients who are taking the 
drugs cited in the study. When asked to bring in their medications, Small said, 
some patients arrive with shopping bags filled with pill bottles. Often, the 
prescriptions are old; when people change doctors, Small said, the new 
physicians don't want to take patients off medications they have been using for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some drugs that are fine for younger people may pose dangers to older people, 
whose livers and kidneys may not function well enough to absorb the 
medications. According to Wolfe, the consumer advocate, adverse reactions to 
drugs by people over 60 account for more than 650,000 hospitalizations each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe said an estimated 60,000 people each year become afflicted with 
drug-induced Parkinson's disease, the result of medications widely prescribed 
for heartburn and indigestion. About one-seventh of all hip fractures in the 
United States occur when elderly people fall as a result of being disoriented 
by a prescription drug, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harvard researchers drew their data from profiles of 6,171 patients who 
participated in the most recent National Medical Expenditure Survey, conducted 
by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 But the researchers were only able to look at individual drugs the patients 
were taking. They could not assess the extent of other important problems -- 
drugs that are prescribed in doses too large for the elderly, and drugs that 
become dangerous when taken in combination with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were only able to look at one type of dangerous prescribing," Woolhandler 
said. "Our definition of bad prescribing was a very limited and partial one." 
Caution on Drugs 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one-fourth of all older Americans are prescribed drugs that may be 
dangerous for them, according to a new study by Harvard University. The 
following are the seven most commonly prescribed dangerous drugs; each are 
given to more than 500,000 senior citizens each year. 
</P>
<P>
 A word of caution: Experts advise senior citizens who are taking these drugs 
not to stop on their own. First, consult a doctor who can supervise a 
withdrawal or a switch to a safer alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dipyridamole (Persantine): Blood thinner designed for patients with 
artificial heart valves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Propoxyphene (Darvon, Darvocet): Addictive narcotic no more effective than 
aspirin for pain. Can cause respiratory failure at low doses when combined with 
alcohol. Also can cause seizures and heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amitriptyline (Elavil, Limbitrol, Triavil, Etrafon, Endep): Antidepressant 
that often causes difficulty urinating, dizziness and drowsiness that may cause 
falls. Can worsen confusion and glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chlorpropamide (Diabinese): Pill to lower blood sugar in diabetics. Can 
cause dangerous fluid retention. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diazepam (Valium): Sedative/sleeping pill. Its potency can keep many senior 
citizens sleepy all day and prone to confusion, falls and hip fractures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chlordiazepoxide (Librium): Sedative/sleeping pill. Its potency keeps many 
senior citizens sleepy all day and prone to confusion, falls and hip fractures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Indomethacin (Indocin): Pain reliever and anti-inflammatory medication that 
can cause confusion and headaches. Also risk of bleeding from the stomach.

HUBER BELIEVED ORIGINALLY HELD IN REFRIGERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON and RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A police affidavit and diagram filed in court here Tuesday indicate that 
Denise Huber may have been killed and her body kept in an upright 
refrigerator-freezer in an Orange County warehouse until the man accused of 
killing her purchased a larger deep freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents, filed in a Yavapai County court with a request for a third 
warrant to search the home of murder suspect John J. Famalaro, may explain the 
mystery of Huber's whereabouts in the nine days that passed between her 
disappearance and when her accused killer took delivery of the deep freeze in 
which her body was discovered three years later. 
</P>
<P>
 One Arizona law enforcement official confirmed that investigators theorize 
that Huber's body may have been stored in the side-by-side refrigerator-freezer 
that Famalaro kept in the Laguna Hills warehouse, but cautioned that evidence 
was thus far lacking to prove the theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theory is being looked at," the official said. "But when it comes down to 
putting on the case, you can only prove what you can prove. What really 
happened may never really be known. There were no eyeball witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the issuance of the (third) search warrant, (Yavapai Sheriff Deputy 
Lonnie E. Brown) has been advised of information that leads to the belief that 
the Hotpoint refrigerator may have been involved in the death of Denise Huber," 
states the affidavit filed with the search warrant request. 
</P>
<P>
 Special tests to detect whether there was blood on or in the 
refrigerator-freezer did not reveal any traces, even though bloodstains had 
been found all around the area where the refrigerator-freezer had stood in the 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests have yet to be conducted on lumber and other wooden materials that were 
thought to be near the refrigerator-freezer while it was in the warehouse. 
Several truckloads of lumber and wooden siding were seized in Tuesday's search. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also tested Famalaro's vehicles for traces of blood, but the 
official said those tests were also believed to be negative. The vehicles 
identified for testing included two white vans parked outside the home of 
Famalaro's mother, who lives next door to Famalaro's Prescott Country Club 
home, and a 1977 Dodge pickup that was parked in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests involved the use of Luminol, a substance used to highlight blood 
traces when they cannot be scene under normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hotpoint refrigerator-freezer was seized from Famalaro's kitchen at his 
Arizona hilltop home by investigators Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro lived in the Laguna Hills warehouse facility between February, 1991, 
and August, 1992, according to the affidavit. Costa Mesa police recently found 
traces of blood there, and a diagram prepared by Costa Mesa Police Detective 
Jack Archer revealed that numerous bloodstains were detected around the area 
where the refrigerator-freezer had been installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are expected to announce later this week whether samples taken 
from that area match blood taken from Huber's partially decomposed body. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews with Famalaro's brother-in-law, Duane A. Thobe, 
authorities stated in the affidavit that Thobe helped move Famalaro from a home 
in Lake Forest to the warehouse in the spring or summer of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 During that move, Thobe told investigators that he helped Famalaro construct a 
loft and a large wooden cabinet, approximately 10 feet by 4 feet, specifically 
to enclose the refrigerator-freezer. His lease did not allow him to live in the 
warehouse, and several men who worked with Famalaro in his house-painting 
business said the area where he apparently took up housekeeping was off-limits 
any time they visited. 
</P>
<P>
 The wooden cabinet's swinging doors were equipped to be locked, authorities 
said. Thobe told investigators that he had later seen the refrigerator-freezer 
in the cabinet and that Famalaro was using the warehouse as a 
"residence-business." 
</P>
<P>
 When Costa Mesa authorities went to search the warehouse, detectives found 
that the cabinet and loft had been removed. However, investigators found traces 
of blood "at or near where the refrigerator-freezer had been standing inside 
the cabinet," the affidavit stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, when Costa Mesa authorities returned to the Famalaro home in Arizona 
to continue searching for clues, they removed two truckloads of lumber and 
other wooden pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to comment on why the wood was being seized, but an 
official close to the investigation said it was possible that police returned 
to Arizona to look for materials that could have been used to build the cabinet 
and loft in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the investigation, both Costa Mesa police and Arizona officials 
expressed great interest in speaking with Thobe, who owns the country club home 
here where Famalaro lived, and where authorities discovered Huber's body the 
23-cubic-foot freezer that was running in the back of a Ryder rental truck. 
</P>
<P>
 In the affidavit, Thobe was quoted as saying he "made arrangements" for 
Famalaro to move from the Laguna Hills warehouse to the Arizona home. Thobe 
said it took Famalaro from July, 1992, to December of the same year to move all 
of his household items into the upstairs living room in Thobe's split-level 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, Thobe told authorities that he saw "what he believes to be 
the same refrigerator formerly seen at the warehouse in Laguna Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Thobe said he moved all of his possessions out of the country club home less 
than a month after Famalaro moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 During the final search Tuesday of Famalaro's home, authorities also reported 
finding a number of weapons, assorted adult magazines and more blood stains in 
the garage near where officials recovered clothing belonging to Denise Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among the items seized from the home were various newspaper clippings, 
including an Orange County newspaper dated June 7, 1991, four days after 
Huber's mysterious disappearance. That edition carried an article detailing how 
authorities were baffled by the Newport Beach woman's disappearance, and that 
the family was offering a $5,000 reward for information that might reveal her 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The court documents said other newspaper articles were also recovered, and 
Yavapai County sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie Berra said they were believed to 
contain accounts either of Huber's disappearance or the nationwide search 
organized by her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among items seized was a Social Security card belonging to a woman named 
Patricia Ann Gage. 
</P>
<P>
 Berra said investigators were seeking to contact her, as they did 11 other 
people -- mostly women -- whose identification, photographs or other personal 
items were found in the murder suspect's cluttered home.

 "We don't know who she is, or where she's from, but I'm sure we will try to 
find her," Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith, who returned to Yavapai County Tuesday with 
other Orange County authorities, was assisting in the search and left the 
Famalaro house with two long-barreled rifles slung over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was accompanied to Yavapai County by Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Chris Evans, who also toured the Famalaro home Tuesday and was expected to 
confer with Yavapai Deputy County Atty. Thomas Lindberg about which state would 
ultimately assume jurisdiction in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans declined to comment Tuesday, but the jurisdiction decision is expected 
to rely heavily on whether Huber's blood can be matched to a sample found in an 
Orange County storage facility rented by Famalaro shortly after Huber's 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary tests have narrowed the range of possibilities, and investigators 
are using DNA-type testing to make a definitive determination. Those results 
are not expected back until Thursday, Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities arrived at the Famalaro home about 9 a.m. Tuesday and loaded 
lumber and other wood items into a waiting pickup truck. By noon, officials 
left the hilltop location and officers removed the yellow crime-scene tape from 
the perimeter of the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we're concerned the home is released," Berra said.

DOUBT CAST ON FAA'S HANDLING OF 757 DATA; AVIATION: REPORT SUGGESTS THAT 
AGENCY, LACKING PROPER PROCEDURES, ACTED TARDILY ON AIRLINER'S WAKE TURBULENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration may have mishandled reports on turbulence 
problems associated with Boeing 757 airliners because it doesn't have the 
proper procedures to ensure that safety concerns are acted upon in a timely 
fashion, according to a federal report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-page report, a joint effort by the FAA and the Department of 
Transportation, concluded that some officials within the FAA believe the agency 
could have acted sooner in taking steps designed to prevent accidents caused by 
wake turbulence from Boeing 757s. Others in the agency, however, do not share 
that view, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the conflicting views on whether the agency mishandled the issue of 
757 wake turbulence -- a phenomenon that has been linked two fatal airplane 
crashes -- the panel assembled by U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena 
and FAA Administrator David R. Hinson found a "consensus" within the FAA that 
the agency's ability to spot potential safety threats and take appropriate 
action is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The B-757 wake vortex episode should serve as a wake-up call to the FAA to 
re-examine its processes for addressing emerging safety issues promptly and 
effectively," wrote the two officials who headed the review team, DOT general 
counsel Stephen H. Kaplan and FAA Deputy Administrator Linda Hall Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the FAA has been criticized for being slow to act on safety 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 While the report maintained that the FAA has an "unparalleled" safety record, 
it sent a clear message -- as well as a list of recommendations -- to Hinson 
and Pena that the agency could do better. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle said during a discussion of the report that bureaucracy and a lack of 
leadership and "clout" have compromised the efficacy of the Office of Aviation 
Safety, whose job it is to identify, analyze and otherwise call attention to 
safety-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena and Hinson ordered the review in mid-June after a series of reports in 
The Times indicated that the FAA knew about the potential danger of 757 wake 
turbulence long before two crashes that claimed 13 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Caused by the rapid movement of air across aircraft wings, wake turbulence 
amounts to a pair of "horizontal tornadoes" emanating from each wingtip. 
Although aviation experts disagree on the level of danger, some believe that 
the sleek wing and body design of the fuel-efficient 757 can cause wake 
turbulence that is more powerful and lasts longer than turbulence from other 
aircraft of comparable size. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on FAA internal documents and aviation safety sources, The Times 
reported June 5 that the FAA's top scientist, Robert E. Machol, repeatedly 
expressed concern about 757 wake turbulence and warned in December, 1992, that 
it could be lethal and might cause a "major crash" if the agency failed to act. 
Eleven days after Machol's prediction, a crash did occur on Dec. 18, 1992, in 
Billings, Mont., killing eight people. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in December, 1993, five people died in Santa Ana after a corporate jet 
encountered the wake turbulence from a 757 on approach to John Wayne Airport 
and crashed. Among those killed were the top two executives of the In-N-Out 
Burger chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to recommendations made in February by the National Transportation 
Safety Board, the FAA instituted a new set of policies governing smaller planes 
landing and taking off behind 757s, including an extra mile of spacing on final 
approach. The agency has also embarked on an aggressive program to educate 
pilots and air traffic controllers about the potential 757 wake turbulence 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 A congressional subcommittee is scheduled to take up the specific issue of 
whether the FAA tarried too long before acting on 757 wake turbulence concerns, 
as well as the general topic of whether the people who detect potential safety 
problems within the FAA communicate effectively with the agency's policy and 
decision makers. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, the FAA and DOT were unwavering in their opinion that nothing 
the FAA could have done would have prevented the Billings crash. Safety 
investigators have concluded that the pilot in the Billings accident was 
operating under visual flight rules, meaning it was up to him to maintain a 
safe distance behind the 757 he was tailing. Other aviation safety officials 
have suggested, however, that had the FAA called attention to the potential 757 
turbulence hazard earlier, the Billings pilot might have been more prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the NTSB has not finished its investigation of the Santa Ana crash, 
the report did not speculate on whether the FAA's actions could have affected 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the pilot in the ill-fated Billings accident, the pilot in the Santa Ana 
crash was flying under visual flight rules. He, too, had inadvertently strayed 
too close to the 757 and dropped below the flight path of the 757, which made 
his smaller plane more susceptible to the wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it did not draw a conclusion, the review panel found that some people 
within the FAA believe it "would have been appropriate" for the agency to have 
communicated what it knew about 757 wake turbulence much earlier than it did. 
Others told the panel that although the FAA had a fair amount of information on 
757 wake turbulence as far back as 1990, it was not definitive enough to prompt 
policy changes or its dissemination to pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel recommended that the agency: 
</P>
<P>
 * Review the role of the Office of Aviation Safety and create a more effective 
mechanism to address safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency lacks "a single organization, mechanism or entity" that can 
identify potential safety problems, alert others within the agency and follow 
up on safety recommendations, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take a more proactive approach when it comes to communicating potential 
safety hazards to pilots, air traffic controllers or others in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while some within the agency considered reports from NASA's 
Aviation Safety Reporting System and the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation 
Authority -- both of which had red-flagged 757 wake turbulence before the 
accidents -- to be incomplete, the panel noted that "a more careful 
consideration of this type of data might have raised the possibility" that 
further action was "merited." 
</P>
<P>
 * Better define who is responsible for what within the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, the panel said, two departments within the FAA each thought 
the other bore the responsibility for certain aspects of wake turbulence 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improve research and development, including that for wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel found that although wake turbulence is considered a potentially 
deadly threat, the agency's wake turbulence program has suffered from 
inadequate funding, high turnover and unclear goals. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1989 to 1993, for example, the FAA spent more than $11 million on wake 
turbulence research and had nothing useful to show for it, the panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improve communication between those within the FAA involved in day-to-day 
operations of the nation's airways and those who conduct research on safety 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel found that recommendations from Machol, the agency's chief scientist 
who began singling out 757 wake turbulence as a potential hazard in the late 
1980s, were sometimes ignored or brushed off by some officials who perceived 
him as "a thorn in the side of engineers and program managers" -- a not 
uncommon perception for someone whose job essentially amounts to quality 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 In a remarkable finding that suggests a troubling degree of pettiness inside 
the nation's air regulatory agency, the report said, "That it was Dr. Machol 
making these recommendations might have influenced the decision . . . not to 
take action." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Machol, who retired recently from the FAA, said this week that 
he knew he was perceived as one who "rattles chains," but that that was part of 
his job.

O.C. MAGNATE SHAPING OFFER TO BUY RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Rams owner Georgia Frontiere says the team is not for sale, an 
Anaheim waste disposal magnate has a plan that would put 92% of the team in the 
hands of public stockholders and a local group of investors by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm putting together a group because I want to buy this team," said William 
C. Taormina, chairman of Taormina Industries Inc., which controls the disposal 
contracts for five north Orange County cities. "The essence of the purchase 
proposal will feature a unique opportunity for the Rams fans to become owners 
of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Taormina's proposal comes just days after Rams President John Shaw said 
Frontiere has no interest in divvying up the team she inherited from her 
husband in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw faxed a letter to The Times Thursday saying Frontiere "has repeatedly 
stated that the Rams are not for sale" after a story detailed how a group was 
rounding up investors to buy up to a 40% interest in the team. 
</P>
<P>
 That statement contradicted Frontiere's comments to The Times in May that she 
was open to selling a non-controlling interest in her team if it figured in a 
deal to keep the Rams in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Taormina, 43, and other members of Save the Rams, a group of businessmen and 
politicians working to keep the team in town, said Shaw's comments may be 
simply his way of bargaining for the best deal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a Rams spokeswoman said Shaw conceded that Frontiere, 66, would 
consider selling part of the team if it "makes sense for a lot of other 
reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 "They would consider a minority investment," said Heidi Sinclair, senior vice 
president of Burston-Marsteller, a firm recently hired by the Rams to field 
questions about a possible move. "It's not really something they're seeking. 
People make offers all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere has no interest in selling a controlling interest in the team, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Wedin, a member of Save the Rams, stressed Tuesday that the group's 
first priority is remodeling Anaheim Stadium for the Rams and building the 
Angels a new stadium. That offer will be "very, very competitive with what 
other cities are offering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedin, chairman of the Orange County Economic Development Consortium, said 
that buying the team remains a back-burner option, but that "if purchase is an 
option, then we are prepared to explore that option." 
</P>
<P>
 But Taormina and other Save the Rams members say the time may be right to 
offer Frontiere a quick infusion of cash, especially when the Rams are 
complaining of lean times. Shaw has said in past interviews that this year, for 
the first time, the Rams will need to borrow money to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Taormina said he and other investors believe the clock on a possible Rams move 
is ticking too quickly to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos confirmed Monday that he made a third 
trip to Los Angeles, about two weeks ago, to speak with Shaw about moving the 
team to Baltimore, and officials from St. Louis are aggressively pursuing the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue also reportedly met with Shaw earlier this 
month to discuss a possible move. 
</P>
<P>
 In his three-phase plan, Taormina said, a handpicked group of local investors 
will ante up $50 million as soon as possible to buy a 33 1/3% stake in the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already got about 20 people who are serious about investing," said 
Taormina, who said he has been infatuated with the Rams since he was 6 years 
old and got a Rams uniform for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taormina said he plans to limit the original investor group to 10 "old, 
Orange County good guys. I want people that are going to make the Rams into 
something that is positive for the community . . . who sincerely want to build 
the image of the team up." 
</P>
<P>
 Taormina declined to name these investors, but the names of Save the Rams 
members George L. Argyros, owner of Arnel and Affiliates, and Newport 
Beach-based developer Daniel D. (Ron) Lane of Lane Kuhn Pacific have come up as 
possible partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros, 57, former owner of AirCal and the Seattle Mariners baseball team, is 
estimated to have a net worth of at least $250 million. Under his guidance, the 
Mariners returned a huge profit. He is known as a shrewd negotiator, and his 
company now is a collection of financial holdings spanning international 
telecommunications, venture capitalism and health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach millionaire has kept in almost daily contact with the group 
as he sailed his 100-foot yacht half way across the world, Save the Rams 
members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, 59, and Irvine title company executive William P. Foley II, also a Save 
the Rams member, helped bail burger chain founder Carl N. Karcher out of 
personal financial difficulties in December. The pair represented a local 
investment group that bought up 22% of Karcher Enterprises and now sit on its 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane could not be reached for comment. Argyros is vacationing in Europe and 
also could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second phase of the plan, Taormina said, "we take the company public 
and we raise $75 million. That money goes to buy 33 1/3% more, leaving Georgia 
with 33 1/3%." Taormina said the first public offering would take place "before 
the start of next season." 
</P>
<P>
 Taormina admitted that his plan, put together by a company that specializes in 
the purchase of professional sports franchises, gets a little sticky when it 
comes to Frontiere losing majority ownership. But he said it's the only way to 
build a Green Bay Packers-style groundswell of support for the team in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers are the only publicly owned National Football League team. They 
have belonged to the Green Bay Packers Corp. of Green Bay, Wis., since 1922. 
The last public stock offering was in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get the Rams as a household word," Taormina said. "The premise of this 
is that the value of the Rams will grow because of the excitement . . . of the 
team being turned around." 
</P>
<P>
 After the buzz around the Rams heats up, Taormina said, phase three of the 
plan will kick in. During this time, Taormina said, it is hoped that the team 
will grow in value from $150 million to $187 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A second public offering of about two-thirds of Georgia's remaining stake and 
about a third of the investor group's stake will be held "about 12 months after 
the first one," Taormina said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Georgia ends up with 8.5% of the team," Taormina said. "The public ends up 
with 65% of the team." The investor group will keep 26.5% of the team, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that she'll consider it because we're trying our best to keep the Rams 
in Orange County," Taormina said.

ACTION WILL COME IN WAVES AT 'SURF CITY'; ENTERTAINMENT: OCEAN PACIFIC AND U.S. 
OPEN WILL ATTRACT CROWDS AND THEIR DOLLARS IN NEXT TWO WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eve Allerton gets the jitters just thinking about surfing in front of the 
hometown crowd in this week's Ocean Pacific Pro Surfing Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing in the event "definitely gets the butterflies going in the stomach," 
said Allerton, 23, a Huntington Beach surfer taking part in the contest. On the 
other hand, she added, with family, friends and former classmates all watching, 
"if you do good out here, it's like winning a gold medal." 
</P>
<P>
 Brilliant blue skies, temperatures in the 70s, but disappointingly small two- 
to three-foot waves marked Tuesday's qualifying rounds of the surfing 
championship, which is expected to draw about 400 surfers and thousands of 
spectators to this beach city before the competition ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Surf City" is gearing up for thousands more surfing fans and 
participants to arrive here next week, when the city for the first time will 
host the U.S. Open of Surfing, the first world-tour surfing event since the 
1991 Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Op Pro dropped off the world tour after filing for bankruptcy protection 
from creditors and dropping its prize money below the $125,000 required by the 
Assn. of Surfing Professionals. The Op has since organized world-tour 
qualifying events, attracting some, but not all, of the world's top surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Open is expected not only to draw all of the top 50 surfers to 
Huntington Beach, but also large crowds that have been absent in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of this seaside community, which has had its share of trouble 
during special events, including a July 4 melee that ended in more than 100 
arrests, also said they have taken extra measures to prepare for the crowds and 
ward off problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of that disturbance, when downtown Main Street crowds turned rowdy 
and police were later accused of using excessive force to disperse people, 
extra officers will patrol the beach on the weekends and additional security 
personnel, hired by event organizers, will assist with crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not anticipating any problems, but certainly we are prepared," Mayor 
Linda Moulton Patterson said. "We just want people to have a good and safe 
time. We're expecting a great couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard called the 13th annual Op Pro event 
one of the "crown jewels of surfing." But, he added, "any time we have any 
major event that's going to draw a large number of people (to) the city -- you 
need to be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are expecting the largest crowds on the weekends, because that's when 
top surfers worldwide will be showcased in semifinal and final competitions -- 
and parking is expected to be at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipate a busy weekend," Police Lt. Jim Cutshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds at the Op Pro have dwindled since the 1989 event, which drew an 
estimated 40,000 people to the pier for the final day of competition. Op 
officials estimated crowds at 30,000 in the past couple of years, although 
veteran lifeguards said the figures ranged between 10,000 and 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Contest organizers hope for bigger crowds this year by scheduling the Op and 
U.S. Open back-to-back. They also are banking on a renewed interest in the 
sport after the release of Bruce Brown's surfing movie, "The Endless Summer II" 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutshaw said the department will deploy normal beach staffing, which includes 
10 police officers and eight part-time temporary employees to patrol the sands. 
But he said that police staffing will be increased at the beach on both 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Cairns, Op Pro contest director, said organizers have been working closely 
with police for the past six months to ensure a safe and problem-free event. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutshaw said the surfing competition has attracted minimal trouble since the 
1986 event, staged over Labor Day weekend, when a riot broke out behind the 
viewing stands during the surfing finals. 
</P>
<P>
 One strategy for ensuring that the event's primary focus remained on surfing 
was to avoid holding it in conjunction with a major holiday, City Administrator 
Michael T. Uberuagasaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last couple years (the event) has not posed a problem as it relates to 
unruliness, and we would expect the same this year," Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said the surfing championship "symbolizes what Huntington 
Beach is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said the surfing events will stimulate the local economy and tourist 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economywise, it will fill up the restaurants, fill up the parking and 
increase the night life because a lot of people are staying for the weekend," 
said Emil Jinx Varona, who owns seven downtown businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The back-to-back surfing contests are a boon to business that will "keep the 
city and the people alive," Abdelmuti said, adding that he expects his own 
sales to increase by at least 30% during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's qualifying rounds, light crowds -- young and old -- dotted 
the beach, grandstands and pier. Traditionally, the crowds are small during the 
early rounds of the event, which are held on weekdays, but generally increase 
to the thousands by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who basked under the sun in swimsuits Tuesday to view the contenders up 
close included local surfers who got a thrill watching their counterparts in 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to see surfers in their final heats because you're used to seeing 
them in videos and magazines," said Adam Terry,21, of Newport Beach. "When 
you're watching them live, you see them on a personal basis and what they're 
capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors, too, seemed enthusiastic at the opportunity to take part in one 
of surfing's most prestigious competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing the Op Pro, said Allerton, "is the most unbelievable feeling ever."

TALKS ARE RESUMED IN TRANSIT WALKOUT; TRANSPORTATION: MOST ORANGE COUNTY BUS 
RIDERS APPEAR TO HAVE SHIFTED TO DRIVING. MTA, STRIKING MECHANICS REMAIN 
SHAPRLY DIVIDED. FREEWAY CONGESTION WORSENS.

 Striking mechanics and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority resumed talks 
Tuesday evening as Los Angeles County commuters slowly made their way through 
town on the second day of a transit walkout that seemed destined to drag on for 
several more days. 
</P>
<P>
 Congestion worsened on the freeways as more commuters abandoned any hope of 
hailing a bus and flocked to cars. With less than 20% of MTA buses on the road, 
the small number of bus riders who braved the buses found tight seating, long 
delays -- and in some cases no bus at all, due to foul-ups in scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 While leaders of the mechanics union and MTA negotiators agreed to meet, 
officials were cautious about prospects for a quick settlement, aware of sharp 
differences between management and labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope we can make some progress," said County Supervisor Ed Edelman, MTA 
board chairman. "We are still far apart." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,900 mechanics walked off the job Sunday morning after they were unable 
to reach agreement on a new contract. About 5,000 bus and train drivers and 
clerks, whose unions had reached last-minute tentative agreements Sunday, 
walked out in support, crippling a system that serves more than 500,000 riders 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 2 of Los Angeles' first bus strike in 12 years:

<P>
 * Traffic on surface streets remained at its usual levels, but congestion 
increased on Los Angeles area freeways. The average commute was increased by 
about 15 minutes and rush hour lasted about 30 minutes longer than usual, 
Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said. Metrolink commuter trains carried 
an estimated 20% more passengers, but ridership on the Blue Line trolley and 
the Red Line subway decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Orange County, riders appeared to have shifted to cars after buses on 
five MTA lines into the area were halted by the strike. The Orange County 
Transportation Authority reported that it received a surge of telephone calls 
seeking information, but their two bus lines to downtown Los Angeles carried 
only average passenger loads. Metro Link, which passes through Orange County, 
also experienced no change in ridership patterns, according to transportation 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only 318 buses out of the normal 1,900 were in service. The MTA said it was 
providing service on its 30 busiest routes, but failed to tell riders that in 
many cases the buses were serving only portions of the line, leaving some 
would-be passengers stranded. The busiest lines were the No. 21, which runs 
along Wilshire Boulevard, and the No. 30/31 on Pico Boulevard, MTA spokeswoman 
Andrea Greene said. The agency has no plans to reshape its deployment of buses 
during the strike this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * MTA officials planned to launch a new commuter phone service because a 
transit hot line was unable to handle the flood of calls. Of an estimated 
15,000 calls received Monday by (800) COMMUTE, only 6,000 were answered, Greene 
said. The rest of the callers hung up after being put on hold for extended 
periods of time, and the hot line went out of service for 45 minutes Monday. 
The new phone service, scheduled to begin later this week, will provide 
recorded information. 
</P>
<P>
 * MTA supervisors drove 130 of the 318 buses on the road Tuesday. They had 
taken a refresher course in the weeks before the strike. The rest of the fleet 
was composed of private school buses, contracted by the MTA. Negotiations are 
under way with private companies to expand bus service should the strike extend 
beyond this week. The agency has received more than 1,700 applications in 
response to advertisements placed three weeks ago for temporary strike-related 
jobs. In two weeks, the agency expects to put 50 more drivers on the street if 
the strike persists. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transit officials tripled security patrols of the buses and bus stops after 
an attempted hijacking of a bus by three irate strikers was thwarted on Monday. 
In the only reported act of vandalism, a non-striking driver suffered a minor 
injury when a rock shattered his windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the public relations war, the MTA resumed newspaper and radio ads 
accusing the mechanics of holding the city hostage, but said it would suspend 
the ads once negotiations began. The ad campaign so far has cost taxpayers 
$198,632. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night's negotiating session -- the first since talks broke down Sunday 
-- was set up by a phone call from Jim Wood, secretary-treasurer of the County 
Federation of Labor, to Edelman, a longtime ally of labor. It was attended by a 
state mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 In the delicate negotiations between the transit agency and the unions, the 
path to a settlement is obstructed by layers of politics on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The key issue in the dispute -- even among the MTA's own board members -- is 
the subcontracting of work now performed by union mechanics to non-union 
private companies that pay lower wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders see contracting as a threat to their survival; they contend that 
it lowers the number of higher-paying union jobs, threatens their members' job 
security and depresses wages for all workers. In the auto industry, for 
example, a key contract stumbling block in recent years has been demands by the 
nation's major auto makers to buy many car parts from cheaper, non-union 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Contracting has been a hot political issue in transportation in Los Angeles 
since 1988, when the now-defunct Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 
turned over bus lines previously operated by the old Southern California Rapid 
Transit District to Foothill Transit. Foothill, which pays far lower wages to 
its drivers, has asked the MTA to let it take over another 12 lines now 
operated by MTA, promising $10 million in savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The push for contracting gained momentum with the election of Mayor Richard 
Riordan, a Republican who has championed privatization, to replace Tom Bradley, 
a pro-union Democrat. Riordan is a member of the MTA board and appoints three 
other members. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Edelman and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, both Democrats, said that 
contracting must be considered in the current economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can provide better quality service and less costly service, and not 
jeopardize any jobs and it's served the public's interest, why should we be 
precluded from considering (contracting)?" Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood of the County Federation of Labor called efforts by MTA board members to 
contract out work "an excuse to attempt to move work out of the public sector 
and move it to their friends in the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
 So entrenched is the dispute that both sides have argued their point with a 
common symbol: the dustpan. 
</P>
<P>
 In citing the cost savings of contracting, transit officials have repeatedly 
said it only costs $9 at a neighborhood store to buy a dustpan that costs the 
union mechanics $25 to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood answers: "We can show you dustpans we made 30 years ago that are still in 
service. This is the kind of disinformation that management puts out to try to 
belittle what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bujosa, president of the local chapter of the Amalgamated Transit Union, 
representing 1,900 mechanics whose top hourly wage is $20.83, called 
subcontracting the major issue separating the union and the transit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are several other issues that may be hardening Bujosa's 
position, insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
 One occurred July 16 when, with negotiations under way, the MTA laid off 83 
mechanics -- a fact that has caused union members to question the MTA's pledge 
that no mechanics will lose jobs because of subcontracting. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials justified the timing of the layoffs by saying they are under 
fire and face a $300-million shortfall as a result of a recession-triggered 
decline in sales tax revenue. The layoffs of union and non-union employees had 
"nothing to do with labor negotiations; it had to do with cost reduction," MTA 
spokeswoman Greene said.

JUDGE URGES FINE OVER INMATE CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal magistrate judge recommended Tuesday that the state Department of 
Corrections be held in contempt and fined $10,000 a day for failing to provide 
mental health treatment to hundreds of prisoners at Vacaville state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Magistrate Judge John F. Moulds' findings will go to U.S. District Judge 
Lawrence K. Karlton, who is scheduled to hold a hearing in federal court in 
Sacramento in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulds' conclusions are similar to those he reached in a separate, broader 
lawsuit in June when he found that the department had shown "deliberate 
indifference" to 28,000 mentally ill inmates throughout California's 28 
prisons. Karlton, who also is handling that suit, has yet to rule on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Corrections spokesman Tip Kindel called the magistrate judge's 
finding "ludicrous," and said it "strikes the department as being a little 
odd," particularly because a court-appointed expert recently found that the 
department is "making progress" in the treatment of prisoners at Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, this is nothing more than a recommendation," Kindel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Donald Specter of the Prison Law Office, which brought the suit over 
conditions at Vacaville, called Moulds' findings "another example of prison 
officials' repeated bad faith in complying with the law." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to recommending that Karlton find the department in contempt, 
Moulds called on the judge in Tuesday's case to appoint an outside "special 
master," with "all powers necessary to develop and implement an outpatient 
psychiatric program" for Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulds said eight inmates eligible for treatment as outpatients committed 
suicide between September, 1992, and May, 1993, at Vacaville, the main medical 
prison for Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulds quoted Dr. Vallabhanoni Meenakshi, a former chief psychiatrist at 
Vacaville, who toured the facility last December and reported finding "severely 
mentally ill prisoners were in perpetual isolation in locked cells." Meenakshi 
said mentally ill prisoners locked in a segregation unit were "without 
blankets, mattress or clothing," and some "covered themselves with feces." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulds recommended that Karlton fine the department $10,000 a day for each day 
it fails to provide improved care for mentally ill inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The case stems from a 1987 suit over conditions at Vacaville, and an agreement 
between prisoners' lawyers and the Department of Corrections reached in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that consent decree, corrections pledged to set up an "outpatient" 
treatment program for mentally ill prisoners at Vacaville who are discharged 
from intensive inpatient care provided by the Department of Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after the agreement was struck, Moulds concluded, the department 
had "deliberately delayed implementing the mental health programs, which they 
agreed to implement, and have defied the orders of the district court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Far more egregious, however, is the fact that, while defendants have delayed 
and procrastinated, inmates at California Medical Facility have suffered and 
died as a result of conditions which the consent decree . . . was designed to 
correct," Moulds wrote in the 17-page recommendation.

EL PASO PLAN DETERS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS; BORDER: A FEDERAL STUDY FINDS OPERATION 
HOLD-THE-LINE EFFECTIVE. BUT RESEARCHERS SAY IT CAUSES STAFFING AND MORALE 
PROBLEMS FOR AGENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A concerted Border Patrol effort to stop illegal immigration in El Paso is a 
substantial deterrent to illegal crossings and has led to small drops in school 
enrollments and crime rates, according to researchers working for the U.S. 
Commission on Immigration Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers also give Operation Hold-the-Line credit for significant decreases 
in allegations of human rights violations and other abuses by the Border 
Patrol, and the effort seems to enjoy strong public support, even among the 
Mexican American community. 
</P>
<P>
 But the study also finds that the redeployment of agents causes staffing and 
morale problems and that the enforcement strategy is not a single, all-purpose 
solution to stemming large numbers of illegal immigrants crossing U.S. borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the report found that illegal immigrants intent on long-distance 
crossings were largely unaffected by the enforcement technique and adapted by 
finding new routes into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, to be issued by the federal commission today, makes it clear that 
merely stopping illegal immigration at the border is only one part of a complex 
problem. "To the extent that Operation Hold-the-Line is successful in 
curtailing illegal crossings . . . perhaps it will also serve to focus 
increased attention on the need to facilitate legal crossings," the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, some of the pressure to cross illegally is caused by lengthy 
delays at legal crossing points, highlighting the need for more Immigration and 
Naturalization Service administrative personnel, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is really needed is borders that work," said Frank D. Bean, leader of 
the group of researchers at the University of Texas at Austin that performed 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean, a University of Texas professor of demographics, has been studying 
immigration policy for 15 years. He previously worked for the Urban Institute 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 He and six other members of the Population Research Center at the Austin 
campus spent about eight months poring over official records and collecting 
anecdotal material on the effects of Operation Hold-the-Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some politicians have called for the INS to launch such an operation 
at the San Diego border, some immigration officials have said Operation 
Hold-the-Line is better suited to El Paso's topography and immigrant population 
and not easily duplicated in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS, however, has said it intends to bring the strategy to San Diego. 
Agency officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Hold-the-Line began in September, 1993, and was aimed at a 20-mile 
stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border between El Paso and Juarez, where illegal 
crossings were estimated at 8,000 a day. Its original name, Operation Blockade, 
was dropped because of its negative connotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the Border Patrol there had allowed relatively unhindered 
movements across the Rio Grande, hoping to intercept illegal crossers already 
in the city. Under the new strategy, agents saturated the border to cut off 
illegal immigration at its source. 
</P>
<P>
 After the operation began in September, 1993, apprehensions declined from 700 
a day to about 200 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member federal immigration commission, created by the Immigration Act 
of 1990, has been working for more than two years on a comprehensive report to 
Congress on a wide range of immigration issues. Chaired by former Texas Rep. 
Barbara Jordan, the commission report is due Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission requested the study on the El Paso program because it was 
concerned about a lack of hard data on the new, preventive border strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission is going through the study very carefully," said Susan Martin, 
the group's executive director. "We had received some preliminary reports on 
(Operation Hold-the-Line) . . . and it's a pleasant surprise that the Texas 
team was able to confirm those early findings. They've developed a very clever 
methodology, and the commission hopes it can be a broader model (to evaluate) 
other border strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas researchers had to inch toward some of their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to take trends into account," said Bean. "There does seem to be a 
small effect on certain types of crimes, especially property crime. But it's 
not at all clear that Mexicans were committing these crimes. The decrease may 
have been caused by a transfer of police units. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the school findings were even more tentative. (But) when you take 
four or five indicators together, they start to suggest something." 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 200-page report also found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * The deterrent effect seems to have lessened as the operation has continued. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some illegal immigrants appear to have changed their daily border-crossing 
pattern and have extended their stays in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 * Illegal immigrants who work as street vendors and small-scale, petty 
criminals have been substantially deterred from crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Business activity in El Paso and Juarez does not appear to have suffered 
during the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The rate of seizure of illegal drugs and other contraband has increased. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the report is positive, but the commission also cites several 
potential problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The study concluded that Operation Hold-the-Line was better at controlling 
localized immigration patterns in El Paso but ineffective at slowing 
long-distance labor migration. 
</P>
<P>
 The toll on Border Patrol agents was significant. The strategy locks agents 
into long periods of inactivity in fixed holding positions, causing boredom and 
anxiety, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 The saturation strategy is very labor-intensive and has "stretched to the 
limit the ability of the El Paso sector to carry out (its) functions," 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the commission released the study's findings, Operation 
Hold-the-Line had caught the attention of California politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon) has been a leader in sealing the Mexican 
border by building better access roads and an improved border fence. In 
September, he called on Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to replicate Operation 
Hold-the-Line along the San Diego-Tijuana border. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of the El Paso operation demonstrates that it is possible to seal 
the border," Hunter said. "For years naysayers have said that what has been 
accomplished in El Paso was impossible." Holding the Line 
</P>
<P>
 Here are selected findings from a study on Operation Hold-the-Line, a tough, 
preventive Border Patrol strategy to stop illegal immigration in El Paso. The 
report is to be released today by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 PROS 
</P>
<P>
 * Illegal crossings have been substantially deterred. 
</P>
<P>
 * Illegal immigrants engaged in street vending and small-scale crime have been 
discouraged from crossing border. 
</P>
<P>
 * Charges of human rights violations by the Border Patrol have declined. 
</P>
<P>
 * The strategy has broad public support, including from the Mexican American 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 * The operation has led to small declines in school enrollment and numbers of 
births. 
</P>
<P>
 CONS 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-distance labor migration has shifted to other border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seems more effective at deterring temporary crossers whose destinations are 
U.S. border communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Redeployment and longer individual shifts have eroded morale among agents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Strategy is labor-intensive and expansion of program would stretch present 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deterrent effect has lessened as operation continues.

BROWN SAYS COURTS WOULD UPHOLD BILL ON PAID INTERVIEWS; MEDIA: ASSEMBLY SPEAKER 
SAYS HIS MEASURE TO PREVENT WITNESSES FROM BEING PAID FOR INFORMATION WOULD BE 
RULED CONSTITUTIONAL. SOME LEGAL EXPERTS BELIEVE IT CONFLICTS WITH 1ST 
AMENDMENT FREEDOMS.

<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown predicted Tuesday that his proposal to prohibit 
witnesses in high-profile criminal trials, such as the O.J. Simpson case, from 
selling their stories to the news media would be declared constitutional by the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will pass constitutional muster," Brown (D-San Francisco) said at a 
Capitol news conference, explaining that the ban would last until a trial was 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who says he met Simpson in San Francisco years ago and considers him an 
acquaintance, said the Legislature could pass his bill in August, the final 
month of the 1994 session. Some legal scholars have expressed doubts regarding 
its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Associate Law School Dean Julian N. Eule said Brown's proposal is "at 
least constitutionally suspect, if not unconstitutional." Eule said freedom of 
speech guaranteed by the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution could include 
statements made to the press for profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have grave constitutional questions about it because of the 1st Amendment," 
said Norman M. Garland, law professor at Southwestern University School of Law 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown said a defendant's right to a fair trial ought to override the right 
of material witnesses to sell their stories for money. 
</P>
<P>
 "A witness who tells the truth, but admits to being paid for his story, may 
lose credibility in the eyes of the jury," Brown said. "A witness who has lied 
in order to get a $100,000 or $1-million fee, on the other hand, could 
compromise the entire proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "In criminal cases, where the life and liberty of a defendant are at stake, 
such practices should not be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not barring (witnesses) from saying things," Brown said. "I am barring 
them from being paid for it. They can still talk to the press, but they can't 
make a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's proposal, to be amended into an existing bill, would make it a 
misdemeanor for material trial witnesses to sell their stories before or during 
a trial, a phenomenon that has accompanied the rise of tabloid news shows such 
as "Hard Copy" and "Inside Edition," which compete intensely for stories by 
paying for interviews. Supermarket tabloids such as the National Enquirer also 
pay for stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators of Brown's measure would be required to forfeit any money they 
received and could also receive a substantial fine. In addition, violators 
could be sentenced to six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Some witnesses in the Simpson case have sold interviews to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that he is not alone in trying to rein in the tabloid press, Brown said 
Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) has offered a similar proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he has had no contract with Simpson's legal team regarding his 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly and Senate are scheduled to return Aug. 8, with final recess 
scheduled for Aug. 31.

JUDGE BLOCKS PROPOSAL FOR HUGE DUMP; GARBAGE: RULING SAYS ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT 
FAILED TO CONSIDER IMPACT THE EAGLE MOUNTAIN LANDFILL WOULD HAVE ON DESERT AND 
GROUND WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to construct the world's largest garbage dump -- known as Eagle 
Mountain, and big enough to handle Southern California's trash for 115 years -- 
were derailed Tuesday by a judge's ruling that the project's environmental 
impact review contains serious flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the inadequacies in the environmental review is the fact that the 
developer ignored how the landfill would affect the neighboring Joshua Tree 
National Monument, including the region's "natural peace and solitude, the 
clean air, the pristine desert," said San Diego Superior Court Judge Judith 
McConnell. 
</P>
<P>
 In her 18-page ruling, she said the review also failed to adequately consider 
what effect the landfill would have on the threatened desert tortoise, on the 
region's ground water in the event of a major earthquake, and on the expected 
growth of the small hamlet of Desert Center, including how that growth could 
affect the desert environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County judges deferred the lawsuit to the San Diego jurist because 
Riverside County was a defendant in the contested environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle Mountain officials say they will correct the omissions and resubmit an 
impact report to the Riverside County Board of Supervisors. The board approved 
the controversial project in 1992 by a 3-2 vote, but a new board majority 
opposes it. The November election could cause board support of Eagle Mountain 
to go either way. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great day for the desert," said Donna Charpied, a jojoba farmer who 
lives two miles from the landfill site, 200 miles east of Los Angeles in 
central Riverside County. "The issue here was water, water and water, and the 
EIR clearly did not show that our ground water could be protected." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Roman, another lawsuit plaintiff, characterized McConnell's ruling as "a 
major victory for the people who live in the California desert. It's time for 
the people of Los Angeles County and other urban areas to start addressing real 
alternatives to solid waste management. The desert is not an alternative and 
will not be California's toilet. We won't let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagle Mountain project had progressed the furthest among several proposals 
to deal with Southern California's garbage in a wholesale, long-term manner -- 
by transferring urban trash by rail to huge dumping grounds in relatively 
isolated areas. Similar projects are on the drawing boards for Imperial and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle Mountain is a onetime open pit iron ore mine dug by Kaiser Steel Corp. 
from 1948 to 1983; its three pits, up to two miles long, are large enough to 
accommodate 20,000 tons of garbage daily for at least 115 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Until McConnell's ruling on Tuesday, the project faced only two more 
substantial hurdles: final approval by the California Integrated Waste 
Management Board in Sacramento, and a judge's pending decision on a 
controversial land swap between Eagle Mountain and the federal Bureau of Land 
Management so enough land could be packaged for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But with McConnell's decision, Eagle Mountain must again win permission from 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard A. Daniels, president of Mine Reclamation Corp., which has shepherded 
the Eagle Mountain project since 1989, said he was "disappointed but not 
discouraged" by McConnell's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels expressed confidence that Riverside supervisors will approve a redrawn 
impact report because of the need for a huge dump to serve not only Southern 
California but Riverside County itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The company -- owned 60% by Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., the nation's 
second-largest solid waste disposal company -- has spent "tens of millions of 
dollars" on its investment so far, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Houston-based BFI reconsiders its role in the project, the local 
firm has enough resources to pursue Eagle Mountain at least through the 
approval and development stages, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 BFI spokesman Peter Block in Houston said an announcement on the firm's 
involvement in Eagle Mountain will be made within weeks -- and that 
reconsideration of its role was under way even before Tuesday's ruling by 
McConnell. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Moskowitz, attorney for Eagle Mountain's opponents, said the judge's 
rejection of the impact report was not necessarily the project's death knell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly they can fix the EIR -- the environmental equivalent of truth in 
advertising -- by rewriting it to properly disclose the environmental effects 
of the project," he said. "But having done so, they've then got to go back to 
the decision-makers for judgment on whether the environmental consequences are 
too high to pay for this facility." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Bob Buster, who will continue on the board even after 
November's election, said he challenges the need for a dump as large as Eagle 
Mountain -- particularly since the county would be liable for any environmental 
disasters caused there.

THE ROCKEFELLER FILES: SCIENTISTS AT UNIVERSITY MENACED; CRIME: SOMEONE HAS 
POISONED RESEARCHERS' DRINKS, LEFT GAS JETS ON, SET A FIRE AND MAILED THREATS. 
POLICE SUSPECT A DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE.

 Over the years, scientists at Rockefeller University -- one of the world's 
preeminent research institutions -- have identified DNA, found the first cancer 
virus, grown the malaria parasite and wrestled with some of biology's most 
complex problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they are trying to solve their most terrifying mystery: Who may be trying 
to kill them? 
</P>
<P>
 Police revealed Tuesday that someone at the research campus bordering the East 
River in Manhattan put poison in coffee and tea, deliberately left gas jets on 
in a molecular biology laboratory, set a fire and sent threatening letters to 
two eminent women scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The events over five days in June, first detailed in Tuesday's Wall Street 
Journal, have spread fear through portions of the university, which over the 
years has produced 19 Nobel Prize winners. Laboratory workers have taken lie 
detector tests and have been questioned extensively by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it's a disgruntled employee," said John Hill, chief of Manhattan 
detectives. "We're working on the theory it's jealousy of these two women . . . 
We have a suspect in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said the letters demanded that the two scientists quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my opinion the person who is responsible for these acts is an employee 
there still," the detective chief said. He declined to identify the scientists 
who were menaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Events at the university, founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1901 after his 
first grandchild died from scarlet fever, center on the molecular biology 
laboratory headed by Prof. Robert Roeder, a noted researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that on June 6 a group of workers in the 15th-floor laboratory 
became ill after drinking tea and coffee. At first, the scientists believed 
that cream or the sugar, which tasted bitter, had become tainted. But as the 
illnesses worsened and events progressed, it became clear that the beverages 
had been poisoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, gas jets were left on in Roeder's laboratory, which could have 
caused an explosion. Workers closed the valves and no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 8, a small fire was discovered in a closet. Paper towels were 
smoldering as a result of arson. Two days later, letters containing death 
threats to the two scientists were found in a women's restroom. Two more 
letters were sent to Roeder and to Rockefeller University officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were threatening in nature. They wanted them to quit," Hill said. The 
letters also contained chilling news for the biologists, all of whom had 
recovered from the tainted brew. The letters confirmed that the tea and coffee 
had been poisoned with sodium fluoride, which in greater concentrations could 
kill. Sodium fluoride was one of the chemicals stocked in the molecular biology 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said investigators believe that the poisoning was designed to be a 
warning. "There were many chemicals that could kill you instantly in that lab," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a month, police and Rockefeller University security officials 
conducted a quiet investigation. That became increasingly difficult as word of 
the troubling events at Rockefeller spread to other research institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Rockefeller University said security precautions had been 
increased at Roeder's basic genetics laboratory, where 40 scientists and 
technicians work in the Tower Building. A spokesman declined to elaborate on 
the preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives believe that professional jealousy is behind the attacks. Although 
it is built in a quiet, park-like setting with towering trees, spacious lawns 
and a tennis court on Manhattan's upper East Side, Rockefeller University is a 
highly competitive place. There are no undergraduates, only graduate students. 
Pressure to produce is intense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are working there are the cream of the crop," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's jealousy. It's obviously jealousy," the Manhattan detective chief said. 
He said both scientists were "at the top of their field," and indicated that 
the threats in the notes were not subtle. "You clearly understand what the 
meaning was," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said investigators were following the theory that one person was behind the 
incidents. He said not only had lie detector tests been administered to some 
scientists and technicians, but also in some cases blood samples had been taken 
in an attempt to link DNA from the blood to any clues left by the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a suspect in mind," he told reporters gathered in a police station. 
"I believe he is one of the 40." Hill declined to say whether the suspect had 
taken a lie detector test.

BOY, 14, APPARENTLY DRINKS HIMSELF TO DEATH

 A 14-year-old boy apparently drank himself to death aboard a Caribbean cruise 
ship, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayman Ronald Lucas of Elmont, who would have been a ninth-grader this fall, 
drank the equivalent of six tumblers -- about a bottle's worth -- of tequila 
and rum in a two-hour period while partying with some other teen-agers, 
authorities in South Florida said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayman was traveling with his father and stepmother on a week's cruise out of 
Miami aboard the Royal Caribbean's Majesty of the Seas. They were asleep at the 
time of the late-night incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida and federal law enforcement officials Tuesday said they were trying to 
determine whether there was any criminal action that led to the death.

HAITIAN MILITARY FORESEES DEAL WITH U.S., SOURCES SAY; CARIBBEAN: ARMY BELIEVES 
IT CAN AVERT BOTH AN INVASION AND THE RETURN OF EXILED PRESIDENT ARISTIDE. 
CRITICS SEE HOLES IN THE PLAN. 
</P>

<P>
 The Haitian military, satisfied it has faced down the threat of U.S. military 
intervention, now expects to maneuver the United States into easing its 
punishing economic sanctions while keeping President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 
exile, Haitian army and political sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with ranking Haitian officers, associates of key military figures, 
political experts and diplomats provide the outlines of a strategy that aims to 
make a deal that the regime believes the United States won't have the stomach 
to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all goes to plan," said one Haitian civilian supporter of the military, 
"by the first of the year, (Lt. Gen. Raoul) Cedras will be gone, a new election 
will be planned and at least some of the sanctions will be lifted. And Aristide 
will still be in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea in broad form is that Cedras will step down -- anytime from today to 
the end of January, with many sources looking to October or later. Then, puppet 
President Emile Jonassaint will propose a national election for early 1995 in 
which all parties and organizations, including those supporting Aristide, will 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aristide -- ousted in September, 1991, only seven months after winning 
Haiti's first truly democratic presidential election -- will be ineligible for 
election under current laws, which prohibit him from succeeding himself. 
</P>
<P>
 This plan, obviously, falls far short of U.S. demands -- formally, if not 
enthusiastically, supported by the United Nations -- for what must happen in 
Haiti. The United States has insisted that Cedras must go and that Gen. 
Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff, and Police Chief Michel-Joseph 
Francois must resign or leave Haiti before the economic sanctions are 
"completely lifted." 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.N. Security Council resolution also speaks of "progressive 
suspension" of sanctions "based on progress in the implementation (of previous 
agreements to return Aristide) and the restoration of democracy in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian military and its puppet civilian government expect their plan will 
meet just enough U.S. demands that the Clinton Administration will not be able 
to revive even the meager support it had for an armed intervention, a plan that 
sources said was recently set aside. At the same time, the economic sanctions 
the United States is counting on to drive the military from power will prove 
too embarrassing to continue, the Haitian regime believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They expect the impact will be so dreadful in terms of the country's poor 
that the American people will be revolted, particularly because the military 
and their allies will appear to be unaffected," said a diplomat who supports 
Aristide's return but is critical of the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 This disgust -- combined with what the military thinks is fading U.S. support 
for Aristide and the army plan to portray itself as having a democratic turn of 
mind -- will leave the United States no option but to negotiate a settlement in 
which the army remains relatively unharmed; the main goal of keeping Aristide 
away also would be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 By objective standards, however, the strategy is full of holes -- a 
combination of misperceptions of U.S. politics and wishful thinking by the 
Haitian military and its allies, diplomats and other Haitian experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 First among the many problems is the assumption that President Clinton's 
willingness and ability to intervene militarily have dissipated permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, right now Clinton has set aside plans for an invasion," said a diplomat, 
"and there is no political or popular support. But that could easily change if 
these people (the army) start up on human rights or the refugee situation gets 
bad again or Clinton just decides he's had enough with sanctions and delays and 
it's time for the army here to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, a U.S. official said, Cedras and Jonassaint are counting heavily on 
support from conservative elements in the United States who may have oversold 
their influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conservatives have been effective in stopping any pro-invasion momentum," 
he said, "but recent news stories (about connections between the military and 
conservative U.S. supporters, particularly in Congress) and bragging by" 
pro-military leaders here "really hurt them because it made their people in 
Washington back off." 
</P>
<P>
 A third problem with the military's plan is the assumption that the army and 
the Jonassaint government can get by no matter how severe the punitive economic 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving, even flourishing, under almost three years of various levels 
of sanctions, some supporters of the military appear to be wavering. 
</P>
<P>
 One prominent individual, at a recent, sumptuous buffet at the home of a 
leading army supporter, told of suddenly realizing that the halting of all 
commercial air traffic effective this Saturday means that his daughter probably 
will not be able to attend college in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something will have to give," he muttered about the sanctions and his 
masters' refusal to bend. It was an extraordinary statement from one of the 
most influential men in the military circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The buffet guests said the toughened sanctions won't force fundamental changes 
but may drive the military to a more accommodating position faster than 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranking Haitian military sources said one principle still drives the army -- 
the survival of the military as an institution. And that is now defined by one 
simple goal -- keeping Aristide out of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military, from the generals down to the little soldiers, know one thing," 
said a military source. "If Aristide returns, the army will be destroyed." That 
means, he added, the army will remain unified no matter personal ambitions, 
loss of income, feelings about the international sanctions or even the 
likelihood of an invasion.

RUSSIA GETS ESTONIAN PLEDGE, WILL PULL TROOPS ON SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed Tuesday to withdraw Russian troops on 
schedule from the tiny Baltic country of Estonia in exchange for Estonian 
guarantees of fair treatment for its retired Russian army officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which Yeltsin said was reached with "much difficulty," appeared 
to defuse a growing dispute that had overshadowed the recent Group of Seven 
summit in Naples, Italy, and threatened to damage U.S.-Russian relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that this day is a turning point in the relations between Estonia 
and, in more general terms, the Baltic states and the Russian Federation," 
Estonian President Lennart Meri told reporters after a meeting with Yeltsin 
that apparently lasted at least three hours longer than scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The last 2,000 or so Russian troops, remnants of the Soviet Union's occupation 
of the Baltic states, were scheduled to leave Estonia by the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
 But on July 10, speaking after the Naples meeting with leaders of the world's 
seven richest industrial nations, Yeltsin suddenly balked, saying he would not 
guarantee the troops would leave on time because of "very crude human rights 
violations" in Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to Estonian citizenship and pension laws that Russia says 
discriminate against residents who are not ethnic Estonians. Those laws, and 
others like them in several former Soviet republics, are especially sore points 
for Kremlin leaders concerned about the 25 million Russians who ended up living 
"abroad," outside Russia, when the Soviet Union collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Yeltsin's foot-dragging, the U.S. Senate voted July 13 to 
suspend most aid to Russia unless it stuck to its withdrawal deadline or 
reached another agreement with Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four members of the House of Representatives also sent a letter of 
protest to Yeltsin on Friday, saying in part, "No nation has the right to 
station troops on the territory of another without that country's explicit 
approval, and Russia has no right to set conditions for the removal of its 
troops from the sovereign republic of Estonia." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. lawmakers' moves prompted a rush of outrage from Russian diplomats 
and lawmakers at what they saw as U.S. meddling in Russian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev categorically rejected linking economic aid 
to Russia with troop withdrawal from Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's agreement promised to lay the withdrawal issue to rest. The 
Itar-Tass news agency made the Russian-Estonian quid pro quo quite clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian and Estonian presidents signed an agreement saying the rights of 
Russian military pensioners should be respected equally with those of Estonian 
citizens," Itar-Tass said, "as well as an accord under which Russian troops are 
to be withdrawn from Estonian territory by Aug. 31, 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 The "military pensioners" referred to are about 9,000 retired Soviet army 
officers who Estonians worry would probably support Moscow rather than Tallinn 
in case of a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement contains a clause allowing the Estonian government to deny 
citizenship to an officer who threatens national security -- such as a longtime 
military intelligence officer -- but procedures appear to guarantee that such a 
case would be an exception rather than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Particulars aside, the pensioner issue was only the latest in a series of 
Russian-Baltic conflicts over the treatment of the hundreds of thousands of 
Russians, Ukrainians and other Slavs who settled in the region while it was 
under Soviet rule. Several troop withdrawal deadlines have been missed as 
Moscow used the delays as leverage in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Estonia, however, hotly denies any human rights violations, saying that its 
citizenship and pension rules conform to world practices.

DEFENSE; PENTAGON LOOKS TO START HIGH-TECH REVOLUTION IN WAYS OF WAR; CURRENT 
MEANS OF FIGHTING MAY SOON BE HISTORY. EVEN 'SMART' GULF WAR WEAPONS COULD BE 
OUTMODED BY NEW TECHNIQUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Remember the 1991 Persian Gulf War? Precision-guided bombs that were able to 
fly into a tiny chimney? F-117 Stealth fighters that could penetrate Iraqi 
airspace undetected? A satellite tracking system that helped pinpoint Iraqi 
positions? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you haven't seen anything yet. Pentagon planners say that as a result of 
such flashy new technology, the world may be on the verge of a full-scale 
revolution in the way the major powers fight their wars -- possibly the biggest 
such advance in war fighting since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparking the revolution is the military's increasing ability to use computer 
links, communications systems, satellites and sensors to boost dramatically 
both the range and the accuracy of conventional weapons such as bombs and 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that U.S. troops increasingly will fight from longer distances, not 
actually moving into a battle zone until after most of the weapons in the area 
have been destroyed. That should reduce U.S. casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Defense Department, five task forces are studying the new ways of 
warfare. Both the Defense Department and some defense-oriented consulting firms 
have begun conducting classified war games designed to probe the capabilities 
of the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials predict that within a few years, the military will begin phasing out 
its current way of war fighting and replacing it with futuristic techniques 
that would have been inconceivable even at the start of the Persian Gulf War 
three and a half years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just at the beginning of kind of fully exploring and understanding what 
they really might be," says Andrew W. Marshall, director of the Defense 
Department's Office of Net Assessment, a top-secret Pentagon think tank charged 
with investigating such questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Marshall refuses to go into details, the changes now being considered 
would effectively junk much of today's war-fighting doctrine and substitute new 
forms of military tactics based on the improved technology: 
</P>
<P>
 * Instead of dispatching huge armies to the battle zone, the Pentagon will 
deploy its forces at a distance, using long-range, precision-guided missiles 
that will replace face-to-face combat. Navy warships far out at sea might be 
called upon to attack enemy tanks ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 * Both missile and artillery fire will be targeted by space-based, 
intelligence-gathering satellites, which would not only track enemy troops and 
weapons but also direct U.S. firepower beyond the horizon and even assess the 
damage once the American barrage had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Staples of today's armed forces -- such as tanks, manned bombers and 
aircraft carriers -- will become obsolete, to be replaced by "super-smart" 
missiles and high-speed land vehicles. If ground troops are needed, they will 
be sent on supersonic transport planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, U.S. forces will be able to launch simultaneous sorties against 
massive numbers of targets all across a theater of operations, melding air, sea 
and land forces as never before. Soldiers will be kept abreast by direct 
satellite links. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr., a retired Army lieutenant colonel who 
worked with Marshall at the Pentagon, says warfare will soon become "a 
competition between 'hiders' and 'finders.' " Any target that can be identified 
most likely can be destroyed at once. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the United States and its competitors will be vying to maintain 
what Marshall calls "information dominance" by using increasingly sophisticated 
satellites and sensors to detect and destroy enemy weapons while trying to deny 
adversaries the ability to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The four services also will have to work far more in sync with one another 
than they have in the past, blurring some of the distinctions between air, land 
and sea forces. Air Force radar planes are already supplying intelligence to 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Krepinevich and Marshall liken the current situation in war fighting to the 
one that existed in the 1930s, just before the outbreak of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the latest military technology -- tanks, radios, machine guns and 
airplanes -- were available to all sides then, it was only in 1935, when the 
Germans put them together into a new kind of high-speed assault known as a 
"blitzkrieg," that they became truly effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Krepinevich contends that war fighting today is at a similar threshold: The 
Gulf War showed off the new technology and proved its effectiveness in military 
operations, but the Defense Department was still using the same doctrine and 
tactics that it had developed to fight the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he and James A. Blackwell, a strategist for Science Applications 
International Corp., a defense-oriented think tank, warn that merely having a 
head start on potential enemies by having invented the technology is not likely 
to be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever develops tactics designed to employ the technology more effectively 
will have the edge in future wars, Blackwell predicts. "The key is developing 
battle-command systems that allow you to determine what an enemy's critical 
vulnerabilities are," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Gaskin, another former Pentagon planner, points out that much of the 
high-technology gadgetry the United States used in the Gulf War -- including 
global positioning system satellite receivers and night-vision goggles -- 
already is widely available. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology for building cruise missiles no longer is difficult to obtain. 
Weapons experts predict it will only be a few more years before North Korea and 
other potential enemies will develop medium-range ballistic missiles that can 
threaten the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is an unabashed booster of the push toward a full-fledged 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Goure, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, 
says reorganizing the military to exploit the new technology may be fine for a 
battle against the Russians in Europe, but it is of only marginal use in a 
regional war such as Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Goure argues that the Administration should wait until it has decided clearly 
what kinds of wars the United States will be fighting before it decides to go 
ahead. "If you don't see a big threat on the horizon, maybe you don't want that 
much of a revolution," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace of the predicted revolution in war fighting is unpredictable. 
Marshall's own efforts still are far from complete. And with a few notable 
exceptions, the nation's senior military leadership has seemed lukewarm to the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael J. Mazarr, a congressional military expert, points out that the highly 
touted "bottom-up review" of policy that the Defense Department completed early 
last year does not even broach the subject. "They are fighting the last war," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more troublesome to proponents of the new technology, the budget squeeze 
may end up preventing the military from adopting some of the new techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, planners for all four services have begun mulling new ways to deploy 
combat units to take better advantage of the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 And the effort is receiving new attention from two new players -- Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry, who played a major role in developing some of the 
new technology, and Adm. William Owens, the new vice chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Pentagon's Marshall and his supporters are far from sanguine. 
Without the press of an imminent war to fight, Marshall says, "I don't think 
there is that much of a vision."

MOVING TOWARD PEACE; NEWS ANALYSIS; LEADERS VIEW PEACE AS THE BEST LEGACY; 
HOPES: THOUGHTS OF MORTALITY SPUR MOVES LIKE THE ISRAEL-JORDAN PACT. THE 
NEGOTIATORS FEEL LESS SOLDIERLY THAN PATRIARCHAL.

<P>
 The leaders of the Middle East, their age and ailments increasingly upon them, 
are pushing hard to leave their nations a patrimony of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 As he addressed the U.S. Congress in Washington on Tuesday, Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin spoke alternately as a political leader, as a commanding 
general and, perhaps most movingly, as a grandfather hoping that future 
generations of Israelis will not know the war, the bloodshed and the trauma of 
day-in, day-out terror that past generations have. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to Jordan's King Hussein, Rabin said in his rumbling, gravelly voice: 
"Your Majesty, we have both seen a lot in our lifetimes. We have both seen too 
much suffering. What will you leave to your children? What will I leave to my 
grandchildren? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have only dreams to build a better world, a world of understanding and 
harmony, a world in which it is a joy to live," Rabin said. "This is not asking 
for too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein's eyes misted over as he looked out at his wife, Queen Noor, and one 
of his sons in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness as a teen-ager to his grandfather's assassination by a Muslim fanatic 
opposed to peace with the Jews, Hussein had been equally persuasive, and 
poignant, when he spoke of freeing his people -- and his neighbors -- from the 
burden of hostility and hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we have labored for so long under conditions of hostility, I am 
certain we can see these conditions for what they are -- emblems of an 
unnatural and sinister state," Hussein said. "We have all known the portents of 
that state -- the fear of death, the silence of isolation -- and we have all 
felt the fear that has mesmerized us, preventing us from moving forward to 
create together a bright future for the coming generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are witnessing today, God willing, is a progression from a state of 
war to a state of peace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although intensely personal and far from the hardened political considerations 
of most of their decisions, such are the motivations of Rabin and Hussein and 
of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 They are all men who are worried about the legacies they will leave their 
nations and their people. 
</P>
<P>
 There are objective factors in the growing momentum for peace in the region: 
the end of the Cold War, the defeat of Iraq in the Persian Gulf War, the 
conflict between militant Islam and secular societies, the diminished value of 
Arab oil exports. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commitment of the current generation of leaders has given the peace 
process a personal character not seen since the time of the late Egyptian 
President Anwar Sadat. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes the health and life expectancy of each leader increasingly 
important elements in the region's politics -- and in their own calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein, 59 this year, is recovering from cancer and spoke openly Tuesday of 
using "the years left to me" for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, 72, shows no desire to slow down and even looks forward to another term 
as prime minister, but his lifetime in war and politics has exacted a heavy 
physical toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, who will soon be 65, is clearly fatigued and in questionable health 
after years as the Palestine Liberation Organization's guerrilla commander. 
</P>
<P>
 And Assad, 64, survived a massive heart attack a decade ago but is rumored now 
to be suffering from new, life-sapping illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Singly and together, they bear the responsibility -- the destiny -- of leading 
their nations to peace, of ending the hostilities that have occupied them for 
decades and of setting the course into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of them speaks often of that burden, and it has become a clear bond among 
them, even when they are frustrated by the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the motivations could be viewed critically -- a resolve to recover 
territory lost in war (Assad's loss of the Golan Heights in 1967) or to rectify 
past misjudgments (Hussein's decision to join the 1967 war), a desire to put 
themselves "right before history." 
</P>
<P>
 There is the determination, as well, not to leave the Arab-Israeli conflict to 
a new generation to settle, largely in the belief that the older generation 
with its experience of past wars, tense truces and abortive negotiations knows 
better how to establish a real and lasting peace for the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "One cannot say 'now or never' of the Palestinian revolution, for its victory 
is inevitable," Arafat said last week. "But we cannot leave the Palestinian 
crisis to the future to cure somehow in the way it was left to us by our 
fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinian nation," he added, "cannot squander another generation of our 
youth -- not when it is within our power to achieve independence and peace." 
</P>
<P>
 But even more powerful are the motives expressed so movingly and so frequently 
in personal terms -- the fervent hope that their grandchildren will not know 
the wars and bloodshed they have known, that the next generation will prosper 
once freed from the cycle of preparing, fighting and recovering from war only 
to begin again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bear the responsibility," Rabin said in his address to Congress. "We have 
the power to decide, and we dare not miss this great opportunity, for it is the 
duty of the leaders to bring peace and well-being to their peoples."

MOVING TOWARD PEACE; BOMB DAMAGES ISRAELI EMBASSY IN LONDON; ANOTHER HITS 
JEWISH CENTER; TERRORISM: WOMAN SOUGHT IN MISSION BLAST, WHICH INJURED AT LEAST 
13. NO GROUP CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY, BUT OFFICIALS BLAME ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS.

 Authorities late Tuesday were searching for a middle-aged woman who was said 
to be fashionably attired, carried a Harrods shopping bag and drove a gray Audi 
-- and whose trunk carried a bomb that exploded outside the Israeli Embassy 
here and injured more than a dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today, a second car bomb exploded outside a building housing Jewish 
organizations in north London, the Associated Press reported, injuring five 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The first blast, which came hours after Jordan and Israel signed an accord in 
Washington ending their 46-year state of war, occurred shortly after noon in 
front of the embassy in the busy Kensington section of West London. Windows 
were shattered in a wide area by the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Four members of the Royal Family were in nearby Kensington Palace, where 
windows were broken: Princess Margaret; the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, and 
Princess Michael of Kent. All were uninjured. Princess Diana, who also lives 
there, was vacationing in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 While no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in Washington, blamed Islamic terrorists, saying 
they were trying to wreck the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the world should wake up to the danger posed by terrorists, declaring: 
"There is no doubt in my mind we face a wave of extreme Islamic radical 
terrorist movements in the Arab Muslim countries. They have infrastructure all 
over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the July 18 Buenos Aires blast, which left at least 96 people dead in 
a building that housed several of that city's Jewish organizations; at least 29 
people were killed in a bomb attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 
1992. Israel has suggested that Iran may have been involved in both incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of a worldwide terrorist campaign to disrupt the Mideast peace process 
also intensified Tuesday with Panamanian officials' announcement that a 
commuter plane crash last week that killed 21 people, more than half of them 
Jews, was caused by a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the last anti-Israeli attack occurred in 1982 -- the attempted 
assassination of Ambassador Shlomo Argov outside a hotel on Park Lane; that 
incident disabled him and helped prompt the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's blast was heard as far as eight miles away around central and 
western London. Victims -- some cut by flying glass, others in shock -- 
received quick assistance from firefighters at Kensington station around the 
corner from the explosion site. There were no reported fatalities, and the 
final tally of the injured was put at 13 in some news service accounts, 14 in 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast was felt at the nearby Royal Albert Hall, where a ticket-seller 
remarked: "It was such a loud bang, we all thought it must have gone off right 
outside. It was terrifying. The whole building shook." 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli Embassy is on Kensington Palace Gardens, a tree-shaded, 
semiprivate street that is home to several other major diplomatic facilities, 
including the Russian Embassy. The north-south street has gates -- generally 
open during the day -- and police checkpoints at both ends. Authorities were 
investigating what appeared to be a serious lapse of security. 
</P>
<P>
 British police guard the checkpoints at the end of the street; the Israeli 
Embassy has its own security guards at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the woman -- whom Police Cmdr. David Tucker described as having 
long hair and being of "Mediterranean appearance" -- managed to park her car 
next to the embassy and walk away. The guards even got a good look at her, 
although authorities insisted that the woman did not attract attention to 
herself. Police said they were preparing to examine her car when the explosion 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "One office (in the embassy) was completely wrecked, and the main stairway has 
collapsed," said Rachel Gordon, Israeli Embassy press officer. "There are four 
floors and it seems like the roof and ceiling on the fourth floor have also 
collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Partridge, who was 20 yards away when the bomb exploded, said: "The 
street was full of bits of vehicle. It felt like bits of glass were flying 
everywhere. All the windows in the surrounding buildings were smashed out." 
Partridge, who served with the British Army in Northern Ireland, estimated the 
bomb to contain about 30 pounds of explosives, which was confirmed later by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 The second blast occurred at 12:46 a.m. today outside Belfour House in the 
north Finchley area, eight miles north of the Israeli Embassy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building houses Israeli and Jewish organizations, including the Joint 
Israel Appeal, a charity fund-raising group that supports causes in Israel and 
in Britain's Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Whine, a director of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said after 
the first blast that he was shocked and horrified -- but not surprised -- by 
the attack. He said he thought it likely that Middle Eastern terrorists were 
responsible and said it was possible there was a link to the bombing of the 
Jewish community headquarters in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're already at a fairly high state of alert," he said. "We're in constant 
touch with police." He said the board had asked police to ban parking outside 
Jewish buildings but were still waiting for a response. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul Kader, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization in London, 
declared: "Our first impression is that this could have been the same people 
that carried out the bombing in Buenos Aires and that they are carrying out a 
series of bomb attacks. I can be certain they are not Palestinians. Even those 
Palestinians who are against the peace agreement have pledged not to take any 
action like this."

PLO ASSAILS JORDAN OVER JERUSALEM; CONTROVERSY: ARAFAT AND OTHER LEADERS CHARGE 
THAT THE PACT WITH ISRAEL FREEZES THEM OUT OF THE CITY THEY CONSIDER THEIR 
CAPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even as Jordan celebrated its rapprochement with Israel, it found itself in a 
quarrel Tuesday with the Palestine Liberation Organization over guardianship of 
Islamic shrines in this city. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO leaders, seeing an Israeli maneuver to undercut the Palestinian claim to 
East Jerusalem as the future capital of an independent state, objected strongly 
to Israel's promise to give Jordan "high priority" in talks on Jerusalem's 
status because of its "historic role" here. 
</P>
<P>
 In the background is Israel's hope of establishing an interfaith authority to 
administer Jerusalem's holy places -- Christian, Islamic and Jewish -- and 
allow it to retain full control over the city, which it calls "the eternal and 
undivided capital of the Jewish people." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement signed with the PLO in September, Israel committed itself 
to negotiate Jerusalem's status as part of the final settlement of the 
Palestinian issue. Those talks are due to start in less than two years, and 
Israel has been seeking religious and diplomatic support for an interfaith 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The ease and speed with which Israel and Jordan drew up their Washington 
declaration aroused suspicions among Palestinians that Israel was pursuing the 
"Jordanian option" -- seeking peace with King Hussein in the hope that it could 
avoid some of the difficult compromises that would be required when negotiating 
with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was simply shock that Hussein would, apparently, go along with 
Israel, implicitly accepting its plan for Jerusalem's future in return for a 
role as custodian of Muslim holy places here. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuking Hussein, the East Jerusalem newspaper Al Quds said in an editorial, 
"It is worthwhile remembering that the issue of Arab Jerusalem is not merely an 
issue of religious ceremonies or holy places only, but a political and 
geographic one as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Although PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat congratulated Hussein and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin when they signed the Washington declaration Monday, a 
spokesman said Tuesday that the agreement was "made at the expense of the 
Palestinians and intended to weaken the Palestinian position" on Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued by the Palestinian news agency WAFA in Gaza City, the 
PLO said: "The Israeli government has no right to give any role or commitment 
on Jerusalem since it is an occupying state. . . . This (agreement) 
predetermines the fate of Jerusalem . . . and ignores Jerusalem as a political, 
Palestinian, Arab, Christian and Islamic issue and ignores the fact that it is 
an occupied city." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin boasted to Israeli journalists in Washington that he had worded the 
paragraph on Jerusalem personally with the intention of establishing a 
distinction between political Jerusalem and religious Jerusalem. "There's now a 
separation between the political-diplomatic problem and the religious problem 
concerning the places holy to Muslims," he declared, saying he is ready to talk 
with other Muslim leaders about the Islamic shrines. 
</P>
<P>
 Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian Authority official responsible for the 
Jerusalem issue, warned Jordan that, regardless of agreements reached with 
Israel, it will have to deal with Palestinians on Jerusalem and the role that 
Hussein as a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed wishes to retain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The final status is a Palestinian issue -- it concerns Palestinians," 
Husseini said. "As for interim solutions, we support Islamic participation, but 
the final status (of Jerusalem) cannot be solved without us." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Palestinian leaders also criticized Jordan for allowing itself to be 
drawn into such a controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any contradiction between Palestinians and Jordanians will play into the 
hands of the Israelis, and the Israelis will profit from it," said Ziad abu 
Zayyad, a member of the Palestinian team negotiating with Israel. "This issue 
has to be worked out between the Palestinian leadership and Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
 Saeb Erekat, municipal affairs minister in the Palestinian Authority, said 
Jordan accepted Israel too early and denied the Arabs leverage toward achieving 
a Palestinian state. "Israel is trying to jump and reach the fruits of peace 
without meeting the requirements (of) . . . withdrawal from all the occupied 
Arab territories, including East Jerusalem," Erekat said.

BOSNIA SERBS TO CLOSE KEY ROUTE INTO SARAJEVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a harsh blow to peace prospects, Bosnian Serbs said Tuesday they would 
re-establish their stranglehold on Sarajevo, closing the only route civilians 
can use to enter and leave the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise action, to take effect today, will deprive the Bosnian capital of 
a major food-supply route at a time when the U.N. airlift is indefinitely 
suspended.It will also end a four-month period of near normalcy for Sarajevo, 
the first since Serbs began a bombardment and siege in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the U.N. peacekeeping force, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic said the road was being closed because the Muslim-led government had 
violated the March agreement that opened the route. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused the government of using the road to smuggle arms and ammunition 
into Sarajevo. He also complained that government troops had been firing into 
Serbian territory and that the government had not honored agreements on 
prisoner exchanges.

MINORITIES PRESS FOR NEWSROOM DIVERSITY; JOURNALISM: 'UNITY '94' CONFERENCE IS 
LARGEST OF ITS KIND. MEMBERS CALL FOR GREATER NUMBERS IN MANAGEMENT, MORE 
ACCURATE NEWS PORTRAYALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 5,000 minority journalists, in their largest gathering ever, came 
here this week determined to pressure the nation's news executives to increase 
their numbers in management ranks and to offer more sensitive and accurate 
portrayals of blacks, Latinos, Asians and Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conference, dubbed "Unity '94," comes after a 15-year period in which 
the number of minorities in the newspaper business has risen steadily, from 
less than 4% in 1978 to 10.5% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the racial and ethnic makeup of those who report and edit the news still 
falls far short of mirroring America. Minorities account for one-fourth of the 
U.S. population and 43% in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made some inroads, but I would not call it progress," said Dorothy 
Gilliam, a Washington Post columnist and president of the National Assn. of 
Black Journalists. She said that African Americans are too often portrayed in 
the media "with a criminal face." 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of groups representing Asian American, Latino and Native American 
journalists said that their communities are treated in the media either as 
"invisible" or as the source of a particular problem, such as immigration. The 
key to more accurate treatment of minority communities, they said, is to hire 
more minorities to report, edit and broadcast the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "A media that does not reflect its community eventually will not survive," 
Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
 That message certainly has reached the top ranks of the news business. 
Executives from every major television network and the publishers of many of 
the largest newspapers will be here. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, the top executives of the New York Times, the Los Angeles 
Times, USA Today and the Seattle Times answered questions in a town hall 
meeting that was also broadcast by satellite to Washington and San Francisco. 
Perhaps even more important to the journalists attending the meeting, the top 
executives brought with them 400 recruiters to interview job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The publishers and news executives were criticized for everything from 
printing too much "bad news" to portraying older persons as "greedy geezers" 
and reporting that "Muslims" carried out the bombing of New York's World Trade 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our job to be pounded on," said Peter Prichard of USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last decade, the minority journalists have met annually in four 
separate conventions. Besides the black journalists, the groups are the 
National Assn. of Hispanic Journalists, the Asian American Journalists Assn. 
and the Native American Journalists Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the four groups, while maintaining their separate identities, 
decided to join forces in a single conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our common goal is to have better portrayals of our community," said Evelyn 
Hsu, a Washington Post editor and president of the Asian American journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite years of warnings, racial and ethnic stereotypes "continue to infect 
journalism," concluded a study done at San Francisco State University and 
sponsored by Unity '94. The 55-page report analyzed news coverage of racial and 
ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that in photos, through headlines and in news footage, blacks 
were often portrayed as "rap stars, drug addicts (or) welfare mothers," Latinos 
as "aliens and foreigners," Asian Americans as "inscrutable, manipulative" 
invaders of U.S. business, and Native Americans as "Indian drunks." 
</P>
<P>
 The report faults the use of stale metaphors, such as "on the warpath" and 
"circling the wagons," that offend Native Americans. It also calls for an end 
to the use of the term "illegal aliens," which one analyst said "conjures up 
images of menacing, greenish creatures who are invaders from another planet." 
The term "illegal immigrant" conveys the same information, without the 
pejorative connotation, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the study focused on such common complaints about the press, it is not 
at all clear that most members of minority groups are troubled by the news 
coverage they see. 
</P>
<P>
 A Gallup Poll released Tuesday found that blacks were most disturbed about 
crime coverage. For example, 55% of blacks who were surveyed said that blacks 
are treated unfairly in crime coverage on national television, while only 14% 
of Asian Americans and 34% of Latinos were found to be similarly concerned 
about how they are portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 For local newspapers, the figures were about the same: 47% of blacks said that 
the crime coverage is unfair, compared to 30% of Latinos and 10% of Asian 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the survey, conducted for USA Today and Cable News Network, found 
that most minority viewers and readers are satisfied with news coverage. Asked 
about local newspapers, 72% of the Latino respondents, 61% of the Asian 
Americans and 48% of the blacks said that they were satisfied with the 
coverage. National television news fared even better, as 76% of Latinos, 74% of 
Asians and 58% of black viewers said they are satisfied with the coverage.

ASSAULT GUN BAN EXPECTED TO SURVIVE IN FINAL CRIME BILL; CONGRESS: PROVISION IS 
APPROVED BY SENATE NEGOTIATORS, AND HOUSE CONFEREES ARE POISED TO FOLLOW. 
LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE IS EXPECTED TO PASS EASILY. 
</P>

<P>
 The much-debated ban on military-style assault weapons appeared destined for 
final approval after Senate negotiators voted Tuesday to keep it in the crime 
bill and House conferees are expected to do the same today. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial ban, sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.), was approved, 5 to 4, by Senate conferees as the long-delayed crime 
legislation moved closer to final congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
 On the House side, Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) said that he would provide the 
key vote today for the ban, which would prohibit future possession or sale of 
19 military-style weapons and copycat models. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde said in an interview that Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), who is chairman of 
the House Judiciary Committee and is presiding over the negotiations, would 
join with the three other Republican conferees in opposing it. Hyde said he 
would join with the other five Democrats in supporting it. If none of those 
votes changes, the measure would win approval, 6 to 4. The provision was passed 
by the House, 216 to 214, last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 While foes of gun control in the House and Senate have threatened to vote 
against the final version of the $30.2-billion crime bill if the assault 
weapons ban is included, House Democratic leaders have predicted that it will 
pass easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's meeting of Senate-House conferees was their first decision-making 
session since the crime bill passed the House in April. Senate conferees took 
these actions on the bill: 
</P>
<P>
 * Voted without dissent to add a federal ban on virtually all possession of 
handguns by people under 18 years old, with exceptions for those who have 
parental consent or who use a handgun in their work. The provision also would 
bar the sale of handguns to juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Decided 5 to 4 to shift $3.6 billion away from broad crime-fighting grants 
for cities and into aid aimed specifically at law enforcement agencies for 
computer programs and other crime-fighting techniques. About $2 billion of the 
funds had been intended for states and cities for such uses as public education 
about crime and drug treatment programs. Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) joined 
the four Republican conferees on this vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Approved $8.3 billion for grants to states for prison construction, 
including $1.8 billion for reimbursement to states for imprisoning illegal 
immigrants and $500 million for housing juvenile offenders. States would have 
to show progress toward the goal of keeping serious violent offenders in prison 
for 85% of their sentences. The vote was 5 to 4. On a similar vote, the Senate 
conferees rejected a Republican plan to increase prison grants to $13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refused, on another 5-4 party-line vote, to reduce grants to police by $1.6 
billion. The minority wanted to spend the money instead for prison 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Turned down on a 5-4 vote a Republican effort to change the federal rules of 
evidence to allow previous actions of a defendant accused of a sex offense to 
be introduced at a criminal trial. As usual, the proposal to put the assault 
weapons ban into the bill provoked emotional debate from advocates and 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without that provision, the bill isn't worth a tinker's damn, and I think the 
American people agree with that," said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), a 
longtime supporter of gun control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities have become free-fire zones," added Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
another proponent of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), however, said that the ban would take away the 
rights of Americans to buy guns for self-defense and family protection. "This 
is one more step to take guns out of the hands of law-abiding people," he said. 
The ban would be unenforceable, Hatch predicted, because it lacks clear 
guidance for police on which weapons would be outlawed.

WOMAN LOSES CUSTODY OF CHILD BECAUSE SHE RELIED ON DAY CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge's order taking a 3-year-old girl away from her college-student mother 
because the woman had put the child in day care has outraged feminists and 
day-care advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It illustrates an attitude toward women about where they should be -- the 
bedroom, kitchen and those kind of places, not at college," Jacquie Steingold, 
a board member of the National Organization for Women, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge Raymond Cashen ruled Monday that the girl's father, Steve Smith, 
deserves custody because his own mother, a homemaker, has promised to take care 
of the child full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Living with her mother, the girl would be "in essence raised and supervised a 
great part of the time by strangers," the judge said. "A child gains the 
feeling of security, a safe place by virtue of permanency." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 20, and the girl's mother, Jennifer Ireland, 19, never married. Ireland 
moved to Ann Arbor with the girl, Maranda Kate Ireland Smith, last fall and put 
the child in day care for about 35 hours a week while she took classes at the 
University of Michigan. The girl stays at a home near campus, where a woman 
looks after five children, including her own. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge was expected to sign the order today. It would take effect 15 days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland, who would get visitation on alternate weekends, holidays and other 
times, planned to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just unfair. It's a decision based on the 1950s," Ireland said. "She 
loves going to day care. She wouldn't be with strangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Levona Whitaker, a spokeswoman for the child advocacy program Michigan's 
Children, said the order encourages single mothers to stay home and collect 
welfare instead of bettering their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Philip Holman, vice president of the National Congress for Men and 
Children, said the judge was admirably "gender blind" and placed the child in 
the most stable environment.CHILD CARE

U.S. DEFENDS RESPONSE IN RWANDA CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. diplomatic and military officials, fending off criticism that American 
shipments of food and medicine to Rwandan refugees have come too little and too 
late, said Tuesday that the crisis is showing signs of abating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not too late for the living," said J. Brian Atwood, administrator of the 
Agency for International Development, an arm of the State Department. He noted 
that some of the 1.2 million Rwandans who flooded into neighboring Zaire have 
begun venturing home and that Rwandan government officials have indicated that 
they will allow human rights monitors into the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee, Atwood acknowledged 
that diplomatic officials initially underestimated what became a tidal wave of 
refugees fleeing the fighting in Rwanda. But he added that U.S. officials 
responded "as quickly as anyone could" and that the relief effort has been 
"beyond reproach." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole world is frustrated -- the relief workers, the donor community and 
the displaced people," he said. "The relief organizations that are working 
there are as admirable as any group of people I've ever seen and they're 
working against impossible odds." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers and human rights groups have blasted the Clinton Administration for 
failing to respond to the crisis more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There simply was not the sense of urgency that there should have been," said 
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), whose Foreign Relations subcommittee on African 
affairs was the forum for Tuesday's hearing on the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Alison des Forges, a member of Human Rights Watch/Africa, told the panel that 
the U.S. response to the situation in Rwanda has been "extremely 
disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Tuesday that they are negotiating to ensure a safe return 
for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials at the Pentagon, which is calling the relief effort 
"Operation Support Hope," allowed reporters to view the crisis center where 
military personnel monitor flight schedules and gather other information from 
Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they have delivered a water filtration system to the largest 
refugee camp in Goma, Zaire. The filtration equipment, with the capacity to 
process 51,000 gallons per hour, will help ease the cholera epidemic that has 
swept through the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also said they are readying emergency medical facilities in Goma and 
that a flying hospital will operate out of Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has committed 4,000 troops to the relief effort, but they 
will not participate in a peacekeeping force for the country, said Lt. Gen. 
John Sheehan, commander of the relief effort. U.S. military personnel in Zaire 
will set up way stations with food and medical equipment to help refugees 
returning home, Sheehan said at a Pentagon briefing.

BETTER FAA RESPONSE TO DATA REQUESTS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal panel Tuesday recommended an overhaul of Federal Aviation 
Administration handling of Freedom of Information Act requests after it 
determined that the agency wrongly withheld potentially incriminating documents 
on wake turbulence caused by Boeing 757 jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 Either deliberately or through ineptitude, officials within the FAA mishandled 
an FOIA request by The Times, at least in part because the FAA's FOIA process 
is sloppy and mismanaged, a joint FAA and Department of Transportation panel 
concluded in a report. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days after a fatal crash on Dec. 15, 1993, in Santa Ana, The Times filed 
an information request with the FAA as it sought to determine how much the FAA 
knew about the potential danger of 757 wake turbulence and how long it had 
known it. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash, which killed all five people aboard a Westwind corporate jet, 
occurred as the plane followed a 757 as both prepared to land at John Wayne 
Airport. It was the second fatal crash in a year involving a smaller plane 
landing behind a 757. The previous accident in Billings, Mont., claimed eight 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 After withholding the records for months, the FAA in May turned over 226 pages 
of documents, letters and memoranda to The Times. Among other things, the 
documents revealed that the agency's former chief scientist, Robert E. Machol, 
had repeatedly issued warnings on the "horizontal tornadoes" caused by 757s, 
including a prediction on Dec. 7, 1992, that a "major crash" could occur if the 
agency did not take action. The Billings accident occurred 11 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Those documents were initially withheld in part because the person who handled 
the FOIA request mistakenly believed the agency did not have to release 
documents considered "controversial" to the public, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FOIA generally provides that upon written request any person may have 
access to any record in the possession of any federal agency, and in a timely 
fashion. Information can be withheld in specific instances, but the exemptions 
are specific and narrow, such as in the interest of national security. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, on Tuesday, the FAA released several thousand additional pages of 
documents on the topics of 757 wake turbulence and wake turbulence in general. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly released materials establish that Machol, who retired earlier this 
year, first raised concerns about 757 wake turbulence as far back as mid-1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents also revealed that the Air Line Pilots Assn. on April 29, 1988, 
wrote a letter to the FAA expressing concerns about the issue because several 
pilots had reported potentially dangerous encounters with 757 wake turbulence. 
ALPA requested FAA wake turbulence tests on the 757 and other aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the DOT-FAA panel's report, the FAA never responded to ALPA. Only 
in the fall of 1990 did the FAA initiate wake turbulence studies on the 757. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said it could not determine whether those in the agency's System 
Technology Division who withheld the information from The Times did so 
deliberately or out of sheer ineptitude. And though the agency receives some 
6,000 FOIA requests each year, the panel found the FAA's FOIA procedures in 
general sorely lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both staff and management tend to view FOIA requests as bothersome 
interruptions that are to be handled quickly and as easily as possible," the 
report said. Those who handle FOIA requests for the FAA are misinformed or 
uninformed on correct procedures, and their responses to FOIAs are not reviewed 
by their superiors for "timeliness, accuracy," or "completeness," the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying the FAA's credibility was at stake, the panel recommended what amounts 
to a nearly complete reorganization of the FAA's FOIA procedures.

HUBER FUNERAL MAY BE DELAYED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Arizona medical examiner's refusal to allow an Orange County pathologist to 
examine Denise Huber's body until the issue of jurisdiction over the murder 
investigation is resolved may force the victim's family to postpone her funeral 
yet again, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials in Orange County said they may have to keep Huber's 
body longer than expected because they have been prohibited from conducting 
their own tests and autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said county officials "will do 
everything possible to expedite" the release of Huber's body in time for 
Tuesday's funeral in South Dakota. "But we can't guarantee it." 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral had been scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said the medical examiner's office in Phoenix was not being "very 
cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
 Yavapai County Counsel Thomas B. Lindberg said late Tuesday that Arizona 
officials expect to release the body to the family Thursday. Lindberg, however, 
said he did not know whether Orange County authorities would want to examine 
the body at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Orange County pathologist Richard Fukumoto flew to Phoenix to 
examine the body. He was turned away by the Maricopa County medical examiner, 
Dr. Philip E. Keen, because California did not have jurisdiction over the case. 
Fukumoto flew back without making the examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to be able to do all the tests they need, but why do they have 
to hold it up? Can't they think of something other than their own egos?" Denise 
Huber's mother, Ione Huber, asked Tuesday, after officials told her they might 
delay the release of her daughter's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why can't (Orange County officials) be doing those tests right now? I'm very 
upset," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ione Huber said she was concerned that her daughter's funeral arrangements 
will have to be scuttled for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought this date was safe. A lot of people have plans," she said, adding 
that Arizona officials "are telling us nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors from Orange County and Arizona Tuesday continued to discuss who 
will have jurisdiction over the trial of John J. Famalaro, who is accused of 
bludgeoning Denise Huber, stuffing her nude and handcuffed body into a freezer 
and transporting it from California to Arizona in a stolen moving truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's body was discovered two weeks ago in the truck outside Famalaro's home 
in Prescott. Huber, of Newport Beach, was 23 when she disappeared June 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said he was hopeful that the jurisdictional issue will be resolved this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are going to prosecute in Orange County, it would be desirable to have 
our own expert examine the body," Conley said. "We have great sympathy for the 
family, but we're not sure how soon we'll have an answer on jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials said they feel it is critical that Fukumoto examine 
the body before the burial. Fukumoto is a forensic pathologist who has 
performed thousands of autopsies and routinely testifies during murder trials 
in Orange County courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the seriousness of the case and any possible complications caused by the 
freezing of the body, they want to be cautious and have Fukumoto examine the 
body as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials say they are also concerned that they did not get to 
review the body before a pathologist hired by the defense, who examined it 
Tuesday in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain observations that can only be made during the first 
autopsy, and basically we will now have to take (the Maricopa County medical 
examiner's) word for that," a law enforcement source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials are not pleased they will have the third view of the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are third in line, the water has been muddied, medically speaking," the 
source said.

POLICE BOARD STUNNED TO HEAR OF PROJECT DELAY; LAPD: ENRIQUE HERNANDEZ JR. IS 
NAMED PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION AND SAYS HE IS DUMBFOUNDED AT REPORT THAT 
COMPLETION OF NEW ACADEMY WILL BE A YEAR BEHIND SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enrique Hernandez Jr., an admired business executive and son of a retired 
police officer, was elected Tuesday to head the Los Angeles Police Commission 
and immediately was confronted with an embarrassing setback in the Police 
Department's plans for a new academy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report on the status of that academy, police officials disclosed that the 
facility -- once touted as "a big win for everyone" -- needs significant 
seismic repairs that will delay completion of the project by at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the delay is not expected to add to the total cost of the project, it 
could hamper recruit training at a time when the department is rushing to add 
to its dwindling ranks. Mayor Richard Riordan, who was instrumental in securing 
the Westside facility once owned by Hewlett Packard, has pledged to increase 
Police Department ranks by nearly 3,000 officers in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on promises by police officials that the $13-million property would save 
millions of dollars and would offer a quick solution to the search for a new 
academy site, the City Council voted in December to bid for the property and to 
drop a competing Sylmar site from consideration. Although police commissioners 
have been receiving updates on the project since then, Tuesday was the first 
time they were informed about the possibility that it would be substantially 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm somewhat dumbfounded," Hernandez told high-ranking police officials 
responsible for overseeing the project. "It seems to me that this method of 
operating is absolutely unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 His indignation was echoed by Gary Greenebaum, the departing commission 
president who just hours before had handed over the president's gavel to his 
successor and who said he was "flabbergasted, to say the least" by the update. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel more than uninformed," he said. "I feel a bit deceived." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hatfield of the Police Department's Police Facilities Construction Group 
insisted that commissioners had not been deceived. He said seismic retrofitting 
of the building had been anticipated but that the extra time turned out to be 
needed because of special construction requirements. He added that some classes 
may begin at the new facility in September, and others can start in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, however, the building will not be complete. In fact, the city will 
not be permitted to prepare food in its newly acquired dining facilities 
because health permits still have not been obtained for the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners fumed as they heard those reports. Hernandez, who said he 
believes the council had been misled when it voted to acquire the property, 
directed the commission's secretary to make an appointment for him to take up 
the matter with Police Chief Willie L. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's session was a rough opening day for Hernandez, the president of an 
Alhambra company that provides security and other services to government and 
business customers. He became the second police commission president to serve 
as head of the five-member civilian body since Mayor Richard Riordan took 
office in 1993 and replaced the entire commission with his own appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his appointment a year ago, Hernandez has played an increasingly 
assertive role on the commission, although much of his work has gone on behind 
the scenes. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Hernandez is the board's 
designated specialist on officer-involved shootings, a responsibility that 
gives him little public exposure but makes him the point man on sensitive 
issues of officer discipline and training. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has been outspoken in his concern about the welfare of officers, 
particularly the shoddy state of LAPD equipment and officer morale. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goals as I set out are trying to get some efficiency in the department and 
getting more officers on the street," he said Tuesday in a brief interview 
after the commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's determination to attack those and other issues has impressed 
members of Williams' command staff, many of whom have developed a high regard 
for the commissioner during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this organization, like most others, is successful if the services 
that are provided are good services," Hernandez said in a recent interview. 
"And to have good services, there has to be a well-trained and enthusiastic 
police officer who is properly equipped." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez takes over the presidency from Greenebaum, whose year as president 
began amid public uncertainty about the commission's commitment to reform the 
Police Department. During his time at the helm of the commission, Greenebaum 
organized a series of updates on the status of reform, using them as a platform 
to urge the department to press ahead with recommendations of the Christopher 
Commission regarding the use of force by police officers and the need for the 
department to adopt a more community-oriented style of policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenebaum, who remains a member of the commission, also played a key role in 
the department's efforts to tackle sexual harassment in the ranks. With 
Greenebaum's support, Williams drafted a proposal to create a separate unit to 
investigate sexual harassment and discrimination complaints, though specifics 
of how that unit will operate still are being debated. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, however, the commission also has struggled at times. Its 
efforts to install a computerized tracking system for officers ran into snag 
after snag, and its work to combat sexual harassment has been criticized by 
some as too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been very serious in moving to deal with the sexual harassment and 
discrimination issues that I've been involved with," said Katherine Spillar, 
president of the Feminist Majority in Los Angeles and a leader of the Women's 
Advisory Council to the Police Commission. "It's not been far enough and not 
fast enough, but there's been progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Hicks, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 
of Greater Los Angeles, said he too believes the commission has tackled reform 
issues, but he urged more aggressive attention to those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have often stated their commitment to the Christopher Commission 
reforms, and they have cited chapter and verse why they have not accomplished 
more," he said. "I get the feeling they are pressing, but I think they need to 
turn up the wick considerably." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenebaum himself agreed that many changes have taken longer than he 
expected. But he praised his fellow commissioners and said he believes the 
efforts launched by the board during the past year have set the department on 
the right course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I leave the position optimistic," said Greenebaum, as he prepared to step 
down Tuesday. "I think we made some real strides toward reform . . . And I also 
leave it realistic about how long it takes to reform this department. What I 
thought could be done in a couple years probably can't be done that quickly."

UCLA GRADE SCHOOL WEIGHS SEEKING CHARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For much of its 112-year history, the prestigious, sometimes-criticized 
elementary school on the UCLA campus has been a place where some of the 
nation's foremost educators tried out their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hallmarks of today's education reform movement -- including mixed-age 
classes, team teaching and cooperative, hands-on learning -- have long been 
mainstays at the Seeds University Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Now officials of one the nation's few remaining university-run "laboratory" 
schools are considering applying for a state charter, a move that would put UES 
at the forefront of yet another innovation. It also would alter the course of 
this unique institution, often faulted for its likeness to elite private 
campuses, by turning it into a truly public school. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling charter school movement, which is rapidly catching on in 
California and several other reform-minded states, grants selected campuses 
great autonomy in their efforts to improve student achievement. Once their 
ideas have been approved by the local school board or the state, such schools 
are allowed to make their own decisions about everything from course offerings 
to hours of operation to staffing. 
</P>
<P>
 The charter move would allow UES financial stability. Currently a hybrid that 
is neither fully public nor fully private, the school is funded partly by the 
UCLA chancellor's office -- public money -- but it charges tuition and is free 
to decide which students to take. If it becomes a charter school, it could 
count on the same per-pupil financing as other public schools and would be 
required to eliminate tuition, now up to $5,000 a year. Because of special 
legislation passed on its behalf, however, UES would not have to be affiliated 
with a school district, as other charter schools are. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the money would come the uncertainties that go with a new 
partnership -- in this case, the state Department of Education, which would 
issue the charter. Also, the school would need to find ways to make up the 
difference between the state financing and the higher costs of operating UES. 
</P>
<P>
 The charter proposal comes as university officials are trying to broaden the 
lab school's role in efforts to overhaul American education. At the same time, 
the state's continuing recession and the resulting budget cuts in its college 
and university systems have forced the lab school to increase tuition and step 
up private fund-raising campaigns. Over a five-year period, the UCLA 
chancellor's office is withdrawing its $1-million annual cash subsidy -- half 
of UES' yearly budget. 
</P>
<P>
 With a charter, allowed in California since January, 1993, the lab school 
could keep most of its crucial freedom from Department of Education rules and 
regulations while receiving state financing as a public school. It also could 
help light the way for those public campuses beginning to grapple with issues 
raised by their newfound independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never thought about the charter as an answer to the budget problem but as 
a way to connect more clearly to the public schools, to become directly a part 
of that system," said Theodore Mitchell, dean of the UCLA Graduate School of 
Education, which oversees the campus elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Mitchell acknowledged that university budget cuts, which have led to 
steady annual climbs in lab school tuition, "certainly focused attention" on 
the school's need to resolve how best to fulfill its mission while maintaining 
a quality education for an increasingly diverse group of students. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, UES, tucked into an exquisite, redwood-studded plot with a creek 
along Sunset Boulevard, has worked to provide research, develop innovations in 
instruction and disseminate proven methods that are relevant to public schools. 
Its reputation and location in affluent Westwood ensure it far more applicants 
than it can accept, despite steadily rising tuitions. Its students' parents 
tend to be very involved. Many make extraordinary efforts to get their children 
to the school, which does not provide transportation, and to adjust their 
schedules to the high number of pupil-free days set aside for faculty members 
to plan lessons together and update their skills. 
</P>
<P>
 All this has cost UES some credibility among public school faculties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've received too many comments from teachers and principals saying, 'You 
just don't know what it's like out here.' Their view is that you can't do much 
of this as a public school," said Deborah Stipek, UCLA professor of education 
and director of UES. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are drawbacks to going public, and the proposal is sparking 
passionate debate.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you begin talking about people's children, it's amazing how emotional 
things can get," said John Brice, the father of a UES 7-year-old and one of 
three presidents of the Family School Alliance, the lab school's equivalent of 
the PTA.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is a range of reactions from parents, and the range of concern varies 
from family to family," said Brice, who attended UES as a child and is well 
acquainted with the strong, protective feelings the school stirs in its 
families and alumni. * 
</P>
<P>
 Financing is a major concern. As a public school, UES would not be allowed to 
charge tuition or other fees to make up the difference between its share of tax 
dollars and the costs of running the lab school, which are higher in part 
because of the research and workshops conducted there. As a tuition-charging 
school, however, it is harder to attract very poor children, who are attending 
California public schools in increasing numbers. Some parents feel increased 
fund-raising efforts detract from the school's "egalitarian" atmosphere and put 
too much emphasis on money. 
</P>
<P>
 The longevity of the charter schools experiment is another concern. Each 
charter lasts only five years and prospects for renewal of the program are 
unclear. Another concern is educational quality, especially since UES costs 
more than the average public school. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, people who come to UES see it as a place that is terrifically 
sensitive to children. . . . Whether you have a lot of money or little money, 
they do a great job. It's a marvelous environment," said Brice, who added that 
he sees broad agreement on such goals as further increasing student diversity 
and broadening the school's role in education reforms. "The issue is, how do we 
get there? This is not an easy decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Change -- often precipitated by crisis -- is not unusual for the lab school 
that began Downtown in 1882 as a teacher training institution at the Los 
Angeles Central Library. It affiliated with UCLA in 1919 and moved onto the 
Westwood campus in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Corinne A. Seeds, its namesake and progressive principal from 1925 to 1957, 
raised hackles with some of her projects: having her students send materials to 
Japanese American students in internment camps during World War II and teaching 
about Russia during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeds' successors, including some of the best-known education leaders of their 
time, put their own stamps on the school. Team teaching and multi-age grouping 
came in while John Goodlad was director, and during Madeline Hunter's 20-year 
tenure as principal there was an emphasis on developing teacher skill as the 
key to a student's academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young proposed moving UES off campus and 
giving it to the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. The following 
year, after strong opposition from lab school parents and alumni, he agreed to 
keep the facility on campus but told officials the school must sharpen its 
focus on research and dissemination to ensure its future with the university. 
</P>
<P>
 UES officials have tried to do that, in part by diversifying the enrollment so 
that it better reflects the ethnic and economic mix in California's public 
schools. About half the 462 students receive financial aid and 36% have annual 
family incomes of less than $35,000. Almost 12% come from families earning 
$250,000 or more. Half are white, nearly 16% are Latino, 14% are African 
American and 11% are Asian; some are just learning English. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has held workshops for thousands of California teachers and 
administrators, forged partnerships with three Los Angeles Unified School 
District elementary campuses, assisted with the development of state curriculum 
guides and engaged in research projects, ranging from classroom assessment 
practices to home and school effects on Latino students' academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, the education school dean, said UES has proved "there is a great 
need for a lab-school-like environment where we can take our experience and 
make the transition between research and practice a smoother and shorter one." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he views the charter debate -- which probably will not be decided 
until the fall -- as primarily "a technical set of questions about how we can 
best continue to pursue the UES mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the 1989 debate, Mitchell added, "this is not about whether UES should 
continue and what it will look like. . . . I think we are all in fundamental 
agreement on the (goal) and are trying to work out the means."

HOUSE ARREST; CRIME: AUTHORITIES PUT A STOP TO DEALING AND DRUG USE AT A BOYLE 
HEIGHTS PROPERTY BY BOARDING IT UP. NEIGHBORS GREET THE ACTION WITH RELIEF. 
</P>

<P>
 For more than a decade, the yellow clapboard house was the shame of East 2nd 
Street in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Heroin addicts would pass out in the front yard or in the three-foot crawl 
space beneath the house after shooting up. Three times they set fire to the 
place while trying to heat drugs in spoons -- most recently sparking a 
conflagration that burned down the garage in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Junkies who used the house as a hangout would prowl the neighborhood. They 
would steal batteries and spare tires from cars, rakes and garden hoes from 
storage sheds and even puppies from fenced-in yards to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that changed Tuesday as police rousted one last occupant from the 
house and boarded up its doors and windows as a crowd of neighbors watched.  
</P>
<P>
 City and federal authorities seized the ramshackle three-bedroom house under 
the narcotics asset forfeiture program and announced that it will either be 
cleaned up and sold -- or bulldozed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God!" said Maria Iniguez, who lives down the street from the house. 
"This can be a good neighborhood again." 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in there were not good people," said Dalfiena Trothez, who lives 
across the street and watched from her front yard as authorities blocked off 
the street and moved in. "Today's my birthday -- I'm 53. This is a very good 
gift. The best I could get." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's property seizure was conducted under a narcotics abatement project 
called FALCON, short for Focused Attack Linking Community Organizations and 
Neighborhoods. It is made up of Los Angeles police, the city attorney's office 
and the Building and Safety Department, which work with the FBI and U.S. 
marshals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boyle Heights property seizure was one of two Tuesday. Authorities also 
seized a 10-unit apartment building on West 84th Place in South-Central Los 
Angeles that they said has turned into a hangout for narcotics users and gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Under asset forfeiture laws, property owners can lose title to their property 
if they do not assist authorities in preventing illegal activities there. Los 
Angeles officials have used public nuisance abatement laws to close crack 
houses and drug-infested apartments since a 1972 state anti-drug statute took 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Such seizures have been criticized by some for trampling on property owners' 
rights and unfairly shifting enforcement of drug-dealing laws from police to 
those with private property. But nothing but cheering could be heard Tuesday 
along 2nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hell, day and night," said a woman who lives nearby but did not give 
her name for fear of "retaliation by those bums." 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who lives a block away said: "You hated to invite anybody to your 
home because their cars would get broken into while they were here. You 
couldn't leave anything in your yard. They'd even steal puppies to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Delta Becerra said a woman living in the clapboard house chased her 
down the street one day trying to steal her purse. "I ran inside and locked the 
door. I was always worried about my four kids," Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 13-year-old son, Enrique, said drug addicts could sometimes be seen passed 
out on a couch in the home's front yard. "I'm glad to see them gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the house was owned by 45-year-old Louie Velasquez Aguirre, who 
inherited it from his mother after she died in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre was unavailable for comment. But Los Angeles Police Cmdr. James Jones 
described him as unable to control the comings and goings at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said Aguirre "didn't even want to live here -- he's been staying at a 
motel." 
</P>
<P>
 Narcotics Officer John Thomas said half a dozen drug arrests have been made at 
the house in the last three months. The most recent occurred just hours before 
authorities arrived to board up the place. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was clear to everyone in the neighborhood -- which is bordered by a 
pair of churches on the east and west and a public library and an elementary 
school on the north and south -- what was going on in the clapboard house. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, while visiting the principal's office at Breed Street Elementary School 
directly behind the house, he glanced out the window and saw drug dealing in 
the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of gratitude on this street today," said FBI Agent Kathleen 
McChesney, who assisted in the seizure. "Children who live here deserve better 
than to live in a blighted area or have to walk around stepping on needles."

BILL BOYARSKY: SIGNPOSTS OF THE RIORDAN REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bus strike and last week's shake-up in Mayor Richard Riordan's office are 
signs of a fundamental revolution in Southland government. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the events may seem unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 One is an internal reshuffling of the sort that preoccupies executive suites. 
The mayor assigned his chief of staff, William McCarley, to run the Department 
of Water and Power. He replaced him with another Bill -- William Ouchi, a UCLA 
business professor and management expert who is one of Riordan's most 
influential advisers. This sounds like inside politics, of interest only to 
City Hall denizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike, on the other hand, is painfully public, affecting the lives of the 
million-plus people a day who ride the vast Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority bus system, as well as their families and employers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a thread that connects these disparate events. It's spun by 
Riordan around his vision of a smaller government that farms out many of its 
tasks to private companies that pay lower wages and can do the job less 
expensively. Government would be just another merchant -- although a big one -- 
in a huge, deregulated marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCarley's job is to turn the DWP into an organization that can compete in the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The department provides electricity to all Los Angeles residents and 
businesses. Residents pay an average of $42 a month. The electric bill for a 
small business, such as a grocery store, may run about $150 a month. For the 
biggest industries in L.A., the monthly cost could be about $1 million. A 
report to the City Council in March said DWP's industrial rates were 5.5% 
higher than those charged by private utilities in urban areas. But its 
residential rates were 17.3% lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Riordan took over last June, the department was criticized by City 
Councilman Joel Wachs and others for inefficiency. Riordan's election 
intensified pressure on the department to cut costs when he proposed using some 
of the department's sizable revenue to help pay for hiring of more police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan got the money, but his Administration felt the DWP was dragging its 
feet in supporting the mayor's push for money. At the same time, the state 
Public Utilities Commission began moving toward deregulating such private 
utilities as Southern California Edison. Riordan aides foresee a day when 
Edison and others will offer lower rates to L.A. companies, forcing the DWP to 
cut prices. Lower business rates would mean higher residential rates, unless 
the DWP can cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Riordan vision, public transit is also moving into the marketplace 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days preceding the strike, he fought hard as a member of the MTA board 
for contract provisions making it easier for the agency to give routes to 
competing agencies -- such as the San Gabriel Valley's Foothill Transit -- as 
well as having private companies do work now performed by MTA employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to serving on the MTA board himself, Riordan appoints three 
members to it. His efforts to bring in private companies was an important step 
in the evolution of the strike, and a marked change from past policies. When 
Tom Bradley, a liberal, pro-union Democrat, was mayor, he and his allies 
settled disputes on terms more favorable to the unions. 
</P>
<P>
 After the strike has passed, Riordan will press ahead with his agenda. He 
believes that the MTA alone isn't capable of providing good public transit to 
the region. And the mayor has company. The agency's critics range from the 
libertarian Reason Foundation to the more liberal Environmental Defense Fund. 
In general, they favor a flexible MTA not bound by old rules. 
</P>
<P>
 They see a transit marketplace with buses, trains, jitneys, vans -- some 
publicly owned, some privately operated -- as part of a mix of public 
transportation more accessible and less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has watched our public transit officials bumble through years of 
building and running bus and train systems knows the merit of the idea. But 
there's also a downside. 
</P>
<P>
 Deregulation and privatization mean lower wages, fewer benefits, more 
part-time workers and a smaller full-time work force. Corporate America is 
heading down this path. Do we want government to follow? 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the potential for corruption. Private businesses bidding for 
government work hire lobbyists, start political action committees and begin to 
shower contributions on politicians. There are so many lobbyists at MTA 
meetings now that it's impossible to keep track of them. Imagine how difficult 
it will be to also track them at the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 Revolutions are high-risk enterprises. The Riordan revolution is no exception.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY GETS 
$3.9 MILLION TO AID ELDERLY VICTIMS OF QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to help a group of people often overlooked after a disaster, the Los 
Angeles City Council accepted a $3.9-million federal grant Tuesday to help 
senior citizens recover from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be distributed to nonprofit organizations that already work 
with senior citizens, providing such services as transportation, legal aid and 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the community groups, working out of 15 senior citizen centers throughout 
the city, also will provide disaster aid such as minor home repair work, 
relocation assistance and help in applying for disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The council instructed the Department of Aging to return within 45 days with a 
report detailing how the department plans to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Smith, general manager for the Department of Aging, said studies of other 
disasters, such as Midwest floods and Florida's Hurricane Andrew, found that 
senior citizens were generally overlooked by local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seniors have special needs and no one really looked at those needs after 
those disasters," she said. "With these efforts we are trying to address this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 For older citizens, it is particularly difficult dealing with the stress of 
filling out complex disaster fund applications while fending off fraudulent 
contractors who prey on senior citizens, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The need appears to be significant. Between Jan. 17 and June 17, the 
Department of Aging provided services to 12,021 older people who lost homes or 
property in the quake, or who need emotional or financial support. HUGO MARTIN

SWEET WATER OF SUMMER; PIERCE COLLEGE POOL USES NEW SYSTEM WITHOUT CHLORINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Goodby to those hallmarks of summers poolside: the stale, chlorine aftertaste 
from swimming, the chemical odor on your drying skin, the red eyes, the green 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good, I hate chlorine," said Jennifer Hans, a West Hills mother of two boys 
who swim at the Pierce College pool. "So do my children." 
</P>
<P>
 Her boys' favorite swimming hole in Woodland Hills has became the first public 
pool in Los Angeles County to convert to a revolutionary sanitation system that 
leaves water relatively chemical-free. 
</P>
<P>
 It uses ozone, a product of oxygen, to purify the pool water and a small 
amount of bromine, a relative of chlorine, to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health officials are studying the newly installed equipment 
at Pierce as a test case for the possible elimination of chlorine in all large, 
public pools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a clearer, crisper water," said Richard Kebabjian, chief of the 
recreational health program for the county Department of Health Services. "And 
there's no problem with it, in terms of safety. The unit is very expensive, 
though, so it probably isn't practical for smaller pools." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a group of swimmers at Pierce won a $73,000 grant from the 
state to convert the pool from a gas-based chlorine system, which is generally 
considered less reliable than other methods of purification. Most pools use 
liquid or powdered chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pierce, the switch delighted many afternoon swimmers one recent day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the water six hours a day, so I'm used to going home smelling like 
chlorine," said Kelley Royer, a swim instructor and lifeguard at the pool. 
"This is great. It's like normal water." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like drinking water," said Pierce swimming coach Fred Shaw, mimicking a 
wine taster as he took a sip of pool water. "Tastes good, kind of sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 Installation of the ozone-bromine system is the latest in a string of 
victories for Friends of Pierce Pool, a swimmers group that formed in 1993 in 
an attempt to keep the beleaguered facility open. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the grant for the sanitation system, the group has raised more than 
$50,000 in cash and donated equipment for crucial repairs that the college 
could not afford. KURT PITZER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; GANG MEMBER 
PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN STUDENTS' DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Pedro gang member accused of the point-blank shooting deaths March 25 of 
two Japanese students pleaded not guilty Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Oscar (Mugsy) Butler, 19, could face the death penalty if convicted of 
killing Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19.The Marymount College students died 
in a parking lot near a Ralphs supermarket on Western Avenue in San Pedro.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler is accused of two counts of first-degree murder, with the special 
circumstance allegation that he committed multiple murders. 
</P>
<P>
 At Butler's preliminary hearing earlier this month, a Japanese student from 
Marymount testified that he saw the defendant approach Ito and demand his keys 
moments before the two occupants of the Honda Civic were shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Masaki Miyake also said he saw Butler push Ito against the Honda before 
hearing the gunshots. A second defendant, Alberto Raygoza, 20, pleaded no 
contest to receiving stolen property and being an accessory after the fact of 
robbery. He is expected to be sentenced on Friday to 32 months in prison.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VENICE; CRACKDOWN ON 
BOARDWALK VENDORS OKD BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved a pilot program Tuesday aimed at easing 
crowded conditions on the Venice Beach boardwalk by regulating vending sales on 
the famous tourist strip.  
</P>
<P>
 "The cops have been concerned for a long time -- as has the Fire Department, 
but particularly the police -- about their ability to respond in the event of 
an emergency," said Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Under municipal law, only nonprofit organizations can set up vending tables on 
the boardwalk, but merchants long have complained that many vendors do not have 
that status.  
</P>
<P>
 Merchants said illegal vendors are hurting their business, and the 
proliferation of vending tables also has created foot and vehicular traffic 
congestion on the boardwalk.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the five-month program, each organization can set up only one table with 
a maximum of two chairs. All tables will be restricted to the west side of the 
strip, and vendors can operate only between 9 a.m. and sunset.  
</P>
<P>
 The Recreation and Parks Department will hire three part-time security 
officers to enforce the restrictions. The program will not affect street 
performers.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Los Angeles Police Department cited some of the illegal

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; CITY'S 
NEIGHBORS FILE SUIT CHALLENGING CASINO PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fear of crime, traffic and noise from proposed card clubs in Pomona prompted 
four neighboring cities and a local citizens group to file a suit against the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by the cities of La Verne, 
Claremont, Chino and Chino Hills and the Committee Against Card Club Casinos in 
Pomona, alleges that Pomona violated state law when it approved business 
licenses and zoning ordinances for the casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The court action attempts to force Pomona to conduct a full environmental 
impact report and put the casino proposal up for a vote by residents before 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne City Manager Martin Lomeli said that before filing suit, the cities 
sent at least 12 letters expressing their concerns, which Pomona never 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona City Atty. Arnold Alvarez-Glasman said that the city has attempted to 
address the worries of its neighbors, and contends that the city is within its 
legal rights in approving the casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Two groups have proposed building casinos in Pomona. The city has not approved 
them but has taken the first procedural steps toward making that possible.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TAX RELIEF 
OKD FOR FIRMS CLOSED BY QUAKE FOR 60 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday waived the payment of business and 
payroll taxes for shops and companies that were forced by earthquake damage to 
close for at least 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Without comment, the council unanimously approved an ordinance providing 
employers with relief from 1994 business and payroll expense taxes, which are 
based on 1993 gross receipts.Since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, the 
council has been granting various forms of relief to victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The city gave one-time waivers for utility bills and sewer charges and charged 
no fees for reconstruction and repair work and demolition permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Large businesses also received a five-year, 25% utility discount if they 
started rebuilding within 12 months of the quake and within 10 blocks of their 
original location.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PARK LA BREA; GUARD 
WOUNDED IN BANK HOLDUP; 4 ROBBERS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A security guard was wounded Tuesday during the robbery of a bank in the Park 
La Brea area, and four suspects were being sought, an FBI spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard, whose name was withheld, was wounded shortly after 10 a.m. at 
Gilmore Bank, 6291 W. 3rd St., said FBI spokesman John Hoos.Paramedics took the 
27-year-old man to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was in stable 
condition with a wound to the left shoulder, a hospital spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in a week that a guard has been shot during a bank 
robbery in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, Juan Corona, 36, was fatally wounded by a woman who entered 
the Home Bank in San Pedro with two male accomplices and robbed the bank 
shortly after 9 a.m. It was the guard's third day on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday morning's holdup, two men and two women entered the bank. The women 
and one of the men were carrying handguns, Hoos said. The armed man jumped the 
counter carrying a cloth bag and took money from the teller drawers, while the 
other man and women waited in the lobby, Hoos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some type of struggle between a female and the guard and the guard 
was shot," Hoos said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN DIMAS; BRIDE, GROOM 
PLUNGE INTO MARRIAGE ON WATER SLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Carla Lambert and Sean Raymond got married last weekend, they really took 
the plunge -- 270 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they took The Vortex, spiraling twin water slides complete with fog, 
wind and pulsing lights at Raging Waters theme park."We just wanted to have a 
really fun wedding," said the 40-year-old groom. "We didn't want to do the 
traditional boring thing on a Sunday afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of "The Wedding March," the couple heard Wagner's "Ride of the 
Valkyries" as they completed their vows and swirled into a swimming pool lined 
with cheering guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The bride wore a green bathing suit and leggings. The groom wore white trunks, 
a flowery multicolored shirt and a green bow tie around his bare neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple said their real rings were being re-sized, so they used 
substitutes. She got a plastic spider ring, and his wedding band bore a skull. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done outdoor weddings and weddings by the pool, but never a water-slide 
wedding," said Riverside pastor Bob Probert. 
</P>
<P>
 The bride said she and Raymond had formal weddings before and wanted to try 
something different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" she said. "Why do what everyone does all over?" 
</P>
<P>
 The wedding party included their children, Raymond's daughter Kira, 11, and 
son Wesley, 9, and Lambert's son, Logan, 12.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LA VERNE; MADE UP AS AN 
ADULT, BOY STILL BLOWS THE SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The young actor blew his big scene, but the makeup job may have been worth an 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Altadena boy decked himself out in theatrical makeup and a bushy 
fake beard to buy alcohol at a market, police said, and may have pulled it off 
if he had not tried to write a bad check. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like he was about 25 or 30," said Lt. Carl Brubaker. "It was kind 
of a sophisticated crime for a 16-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the market on Foothill Boulevard got suspicious when the bearded 
customer tried to buy alcohol by writing a $41 check from a Redlands bank. He 
asked for cash back and presented a driver's license to match the name and 
address on the check, Brubaker said. The store called the bank and found that 
the account had been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified youngster was arrested for investigation of a seldom-cited 
penal code violation: wearing a disguise for the purpose of escaping 
recognition while committing an offense. He was released to his mother.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; RECYCLING 
MARKET ZONE EXPANDED TO ALL OF CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles' recycling market development zone, which provides recycling-based 
manufacturers with special financial services, now encompasses all of the city, 
Mayor Richard Riordan has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the state-designated zone was limited to a 200-acre industrial 
park in the harbor community of Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 "This expanded designation is a win for Los Angeles' business sector," Riordan 
said. "By participating in the RMDZ, businesses will be rewarded for their 
innovation in manufacturing marketable products from recyclable materials." 
</P>
<P>
 The program offers low-interest loans and industrial development bonds to gain 
access to domestic and overseas markets. The expanded zone will allow more 
businesses to qualify for financing that will help them grow, said Riordan.

KING DROPS APPEAL OF JURY RULING IN DEAL WITH CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rodney G. King has dropped his appeal of a jury's decision to deny him 
punitive damages against the police officers who beat him, and in return, the 
city of Los Angeles has agreed to waive $28,000 in legal fees in the case, 
attorneys said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal between the city and King's lawyers is "a good-faith act on the part 
of the city to get this behind us," Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement all but ends three years of legal wrangling between King and the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 In his civil trial, a jury awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages 
but refused to grant him punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorney, Milton Grimes, appealed the second ruling July 7, but asked 
last week that the appeal be withdrawn, Vincent said. In exchange, Vincent 
said, the city agreed to waive legal costs that it had incurred during the 
second phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Riots swept Los Angeles in the spring of 1992 after a state jury acquitted 
four Los Angeles police officers of criminal charges that they abused King 
during a beating that occurred after King was stopped for a traffic violation 
on March 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in a federal trial last year, former police Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and 
former Officer Laurence M. Powell were convicted of violating King's civil 
rights. Koon and Powell are serving 30-month prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said the final resolution of this year's civil trial will accelerate 
the city's payment of the compensatory damages. He said a request for payment 
of the $3.8 million will be placed before the City Council on Tuesday, and a 
check could be written to King within a week of the council's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue still to be resolved is attorneys fees for Grimes and King's former 
lawyer, Steven Lerman, Vincent said. He said the fees are to be determined by 
U.S. District Court Judge John G. Davies in September.

SALVATION ARMY ELECTS L.A.-AREA CHIEF TO TOP POST; AID: PAUL A. RADER, 60, A 
REGIONAL COMMANDER, IS THE FIRST AMERICAN TO HEAD THE WORLDWIDE EVANGELISTIC 
AND SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in its 129-year history, the Salvation Army has elected an 
American as its international leader -- Paul A. Rader, 60, a regional commander 
based in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The evangelistic church body organized along quasi-military lines is best 
known for its social service and disaster relief efforts. After its 1865 
beginnings in London under founder William Booth, the denomination that is 
active in 100 nations has had a succession of British, Scandinavian, Australian 
and Canadian generals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader was elected the 15th general in London on Saturday after six days of 
deliberations by the army's High Council. The new general will return to Los 
Angeles on Friday and move to London, where the army is headquartered, Aug. 28, 
said Robert Bearchell, spokesman for the army's 13-state Western Territory 
headquarters in Rancho Palos Verdes, where Rader has been commissioner since 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 With 450,000 officers, cadets and members, the U.S. branch founded in 1880 is 
the largest national component of the worldwide organization of 3 million 
Salvationists, as the denomination's adherents call themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Why has it taken so long for an American to be elected? "That's a good 
question. We've always wondered why," Bearchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader came within one vote of being elected general last year, Bearchell said. 
However, the Canadian who won, Gen. Bramwell H. Tillsley, resigned this spring 
for health reasons, making another election necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 Rader is the best-educated general in the army's history: His four degrees 
include a doctorate in missiology from Pasadena's Fuller Theological Seminary 
in 1973. Born in New York City to prominent Salvation Army officers, Rader also 
earned degrees at Asbury College and Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, 
both in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks released Tuesday, Rader said the army's High Council sought to 
choose a leader who is adept in strategic use of its worldwide, yet limited, 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, it is what I brought to the table. (A strategic approach) 
means having a clarified awareness of what our task is, where our resources 
ought to be invested in order to accomplish God's purpose for the army at this 
moment in history," he said. "We live in a world of crisis. . . . The world is 
on fire and bursting with opportunity at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 While serving as western territorial leader, Rader oversaw efforts to 
alleviate the misery that has come with California earthquakes and brush fires 
and a Hawaiian hurricane, as well as ongoing programs for runaways in Hollywood 
and alcohol and drug rehabilitation, among other projects. He was credited with 
expanding Salvation Army support for 7,800 employees and about 50,000 
volunteers in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader, who is fluent in Korean, spent 22 years on Salvation Army assignments 
in South Korea, interrupted only by studies at Fuller Seminary. He rose to the 
second-highest Salvation Army post in South Korea before returning to the 
United States in 1984 and assuming command of several Eastern U.S. posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader and his officer wife, Kay, who will serve as president of the army's 
Women's Organizations, have three adult children, all of whom have remained in 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader's term of office will be five years, although he could be reelected and 
serve until age 67, Bearchell said.

THE LEARNING POOLS; L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT REVIVES POPULAR PROGRAM THAT TEACHES 
CHILDREN HOW TO SWIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Prado might have missed his chance to float. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old central Los Angeles resident had never been in a pool before 
this summer. And if the Los Angeles Unified School District had not revived its 
summer water instruction program, Jose would have remained landlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jose spent almost two weeks learning how to swim in the district's 
portable pool at Pio Pico Elementary School, and now he takes to the water as 
if it were a second home. 
</P>
<P>
 But he still gets nervous before some classes, such as a recent one on 
back-floating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to die!" Jose said, shivering as he dried off outside 
the pool. But he said he plans to start going to the local public pool. "I'll 
go in all day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the school district had not rearranged its budget this year, Jose and about 
10,000 other Los Angeles youngsters would have been left high and dry. After 
being mothballed for two years, eight portable pools will be installed at 32 
Los Angeles elementary schools this summer, where instructors will teach water 
safety to children.  
</P>
<P>
 The program, targeted for elementary school children, began in 1962. But in 
1992, budget cuts forced the district to cancel the program, which costs about 
$100,000 a year, said Don Wertz, the district's senior recreation director. 
</P>
<P>
 However, after two summers without the pools, the district came up with the 
money. "It's a pretty fair chunk of money," Wertz said, "but you stop and say 
'Wait. We're teaching 10,000 youngsters to swim. Is that worth it? You bet it 
is.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Ron Kasparian learned that the program was being cut in 1992, he was 
devastated. "I thought it was tragic, I really did," said Kasparian, in his 
29th year with the program. "I never thought they'd bring it back." 
</P>
<P>
 When he heard that the program was back this year, Kasparian, a high school 
baseball coach, returned to his position as program supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program sells itself," Kasparian said. "It's probably one of the best 
programs L.A. has." 
</P>
<P>
 Wertz guessed that 150,000 Angelenos have been taught in the program's 30 
years. It is so popular, Wertz said, that parents who swam in the pools as 
children call the school district to find out when the pools will be in their 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour classes, offered between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., are free. The pools 
are used by students at year-round elementary schools or neighborhood children 
who come by and sign up. Kasparian recalled that children would follow one pool 
from school to school, including a time when a high school junior followed a 
pool around all summer until he taught himself to swim. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertz said the program's greatest benefit is that "a youngster can learn to 
handle himself in the water. . . . This is why people drown. Because they 
haven't taken any lessons, they don't know how to handle their bodies in the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these children, Wertz said, have not had the chance to take swimming 
lessons, at private or public pools. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading a group of Pio Pico students in an aquatic session of ring 
around the rosy, Amanda Feld, who coaches Santa Monica swim teams from ages 
6-17, said: "I think these kids have a good future" in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually work with kids who are more privileged and who don't appreciate 
this as much," Feld said as third-graders frantically toweled off nearby, 
asking if the pool would stay at their school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get back in the pool," said Genovia Herron, 7, a sentiment echoed 
by her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's summer and it's hot, and there's nothing fun to do," said Jusa Mejia, 7, 
who said she was scared while floating on her back yet eager to try it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all student swimmers are as enthusiastic, said Thomas Baham, an instructor 
at the Pio Pico pool. "The biggest challenge is getting their faces in the 
water," he said. "Most of them haven't touched water before." 
</P>
<P>
 Children sometimes start crying when they have to go into the pool for the 
first time. Instructors assign homework, in which the students are supposed to 
put their face in the water in the bathtub to get used to submersion. 
Eventually, Baham said, most get used to being in the pool and want it to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what he would do after the portable pool left Pio Pico, 7-year-old 
Tristan Martinez said, with a slight smile, "I'll cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Baham says teaching water-shy children is worth the effort. "You get to meet 
the kids, they get to know you," he said. "It's an accomplishment. It's nice to 
know you're helping out."

robbery in Washington state and California may now be in Orange County, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Magana Castro, 27, described as armed and "extremely dangerous," may 
be in Southern California and possibly Westminster, where he once lived and 
still has family, according to officials with the Skagit County Sheriff's 
Department in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel he's probably pretty desperate and could be more desperate than he 
has been in the past," Chief Deputy John Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, a suspect in the slaying of a Washington man and the stabbing of 
another in San Joaquin County in California, was identified by fingerprints 
found in a stolen 1985 Chevy Suburban that had belonged to the victim in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro had been evicted from his last residence in the 7100 block of Maple 
Street in Westminster about two years ago, said Sgt. Mike Mittelstaedt of the 
Westminster Police Department. Authorities said they are still investigating 
where Castro resided between the time he left Westminster and Friday's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster police are looking for Castro, but "there is no active search 
party or manhunt" for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro is suspected of beating and fatally shooting a 72-year-old disabled man 
near Mt. Vernon, Wash., on Friday, torching a stolen car near the man's 
property and then stealing his victim's Chevy Suburban, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Fadeff was found dead in his home early Saturday. The victim of the San 
Joaquin County stabbing on July 20 -- a 48-year-old man -- is in stable 
condition, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chevy Suburban was found Saturday morning when Castro was stopped by a 
California Highway Patrol officer. A CHP spokesman said the man was speeding 
south on Interstate 5 when he was stopped by an officer who noticed that the 
car's license plate matched that of the vehicle believed driven by the suspect 
in Fadeff's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer stopped the car a few miles north of Redding. After a short chase 
on an embankment near a restaurant there, the suspect escaped into a heavily 
wooded area nearby, said Darrold Jourdan, a spokesman for the CHP in Mt. 
Shasta. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of guns stolen from the victim's home were discovered in the car, 
Jourdan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect then bought a white 1971 Ford for $250 from an elderly woman in 
Lakewood, about five miles south of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told police that Castro paid for the car with a wad of wet cash, 
which he explained had gotten soaked during a swim in the Sacramento River, 
which runs through the area, Jourdan said. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of dogs, helicopters and a SWAT team searched the area Saturday, but 
did not find him. Castro told the woman that he was heading toward Los Angeles, 
authorities said.

BREA OLINDA GRADUATED SOME WHO LACK CREDITS; EDUCATION: PRINCIPAL ALSO KNEW OF 
THE GRADE-CHANGING BUT DID NOT TELL HIS SUPERIORS: 'I THINK THAT WAS A BAD 
DECISION ON MY PART.' 
</P>

<P>
 About a dozen members of the Brea Olinda High School Class of 1993 graduated 
without meeting the school's requirements due to illegal transcript changes, 
district records revealed Tuesday, and the school's principal was told of 
widespread transcript-changing as early as last July but never alerted his 
superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 Records and interviews show that Principal John Johnson had several meetings 
with half a dozen school employees throughout the school year to discuss the 
transcript changes, in which hundreds of students received credit for taking 
the same courses twice, had poor grades changed to "pass" notations and had 
evidence of failing marks removed from their records. 
</P>
<P>
 At an October meeting, Johnson called a halt to the practice of changing 
grades and course titles, but decided not to correct transcripts for students 
in the Class of 1994 and to only partially correct those in the Class of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was too late to make any changes as far as seniors were concerned 
because it would affect their graduation," he said in an interview Tuesday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he was aware that changing a recorded grade violates the state's 
Education Code, Johnson added: "We didn't think about it in terms of it being 
illegal. Our first concern was our seniors graduating." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Brea Olinda Unified School District have previously said that 
former counselors at the award-winning school changed grades and course titles 
hundreds of times in an effort to boost grade-point averages and help students 
get into college. 
</P>
<P>
 Though employee whistle-blowers told the superintendent of the situation as 
early as February, the problem came to the attention of the school board and 
the public only after a teacher filed a grievance in May. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, school board members ordered all transcripts corrected, and lowered 
the school's graduation requirements for this year only so no seniors -- whose 
corrected transcripts would now lack sufficient courses -- would be held back. 
</P>
<P>
 A registrar from another school and an attorney from the Orange County 
Department of Education are investigating the matter for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Trustee Todd Spitzer blasted Johnson for not informing his 
superiors, and said that depending on the outcome of the investigation, he 
might recommend his firing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredibly outrageous that the principal of our high school made a 
decision of this magnitude without consulting the board of education or asking 
for a legal opinion on whether or not what he was doing is even lawful," 
Spitzer said. "John Johnson showed absolutely no leadership in his position as 
principal." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the documents released Tuesday is a confidential memo Joanne Rizuto 
wrote to her own personnel file upon her resignation in May as the school's 
registrar. In it, she says that administrators ignored the transcript problems 
for months, and then continued making illegal grade changes even after a 
February directive from the district office designed to curtail the practice.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a very difficult year," Rizuto wrote. "It was very difficult to 
make changes on transcripts . . . that I felt were unethical and not in keeping 
with the standards that (Brea Olinda) portrayed." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, Gary Goff, assistant superintendent for business services, said 
that while he learned of the transcript problems at the high school last fall, 
he took no action because it was outside his purview and he believed that the 
superintendent, who retired in June, had also been alerted. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Spitzer praised Rizuto and another whistle-blower, data systems 
operator Sally Tennison. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should stand up and salute these two women for what they have done in 
terms of bringing the truth to this whole saga," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rizuto's memo and an addendum concerning repeat credits -- both released 
Tuesday -- provide the most detailed account to date of the scandal swirling 
around one of Orange County's most prestigious high schools, which last year 
was named a Blue Ribbon school, the nation's highest academic honor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first indication that members of the Class of 1993 were affected, 
Rizuto's memo says that "approximately 13-17 students" inappropriately received 
diplomas though they did not pass sufficient math courses.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said Tuesday evening that he decided not to address that situation 
last July because "those students were special education students and . . . 
given some special dispensation because of their special education status." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials could not provide any information on those students. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law bars schools from changing transcripts after students graduate. 
Spitzer said that while it may be impossible, legally, to retract the diplomas, 
he hopes to "go back as far as necessary to clean up our records."  
</P>
<P>
 Rizuto's memo also provides more detail about the widespread changing of 
course titles and grades changed after classes were complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who chose to repeat an academic class, in which they earned a poor 
grade, often received credit twice for the same course when they should not 
have, and had the low grade replaced with a "pass" notation, which is not 
factored in to grade-point averages.  
</P>
<P>
 Others who received Ds or Fs and then repeated the courses had their 
transcripts altered so the low grades would not count toward their GPA. That 
happened 61 times for the classes of 1993, 1994 and 1995, according to Rizuto's 
memo. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Rizuto says, students in those classes had changes in 163 math 
grades, 126 Spanish or French grades and 35 in other courses. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Johnson expressed regret that he never went to the superintendent 
or the school board with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt that we could handle it internally. . . . I think that was a bad 
decision on my part," said Johnson, who became principal in 1990. "Some 
mistakes were made, and that can happen in this kind of situation. Not a day 
goes by that mistakes aren't made. You try to correct them and you go on."

IN GOD'S CAMP; ABBEY MIXES PRAYER AND PLAY FOR BOYS' STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Most of the year, St. Michael's Abbey is a serene place, where priests and 
seminarians spend much of their day in prayer and contemplation, the 
tranquillity interrupted only by the occasional thunder of El Toro jets 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 But come summer, the hills surrounding the Catholic abbey echo with a 
different thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning the third week in July, dozens of boys descend upon the hillside 
monastery, toting loaded duffel bags and suitcases for a weeklong stay at the 
abbey. 
</P>
<P>
 For six weeks, St. Michael's runs a revolving summer camp for boys 6 to 13 
years old. From Sunday to Saturday, the sneaker- and jeans-clad boys will 
sleep, eat, pray and play among the white-robed clerics, with each group 
adapting their normal routines and behavior to accommodate the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The priests are pretty cool," said Chris Cauas, an 11-year-old from Norwalk 
who attended the camp last week. "But you have to watch your language and try 
hard not to fool around during Mass." 
</P>
<P>
 Brion Baer, 8, of Tustin, has heard his friends talk about playing practical 
jokes on counselors at other summer camps, but he had no plans to slip a rubber 
snake in his counselor's bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do that to a priest?" Baer asked in horror. "I don't think so. I'd probably 
have to go to confession or something if I did." 
</P>
<P>
 The priests and seminarians also have made some concessions to the presence of 
75 to 100 boys in their midst. Instead of rising at 6 a.m. to attend Mass each 
day, the boys are allowed to sleep in -- until 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Vespers, an hourlong Latin prayer service held each afternoon at the abbey, is 
replaced with the simpler and shorter rosary. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Peter Muller, who has spent several summers as a counselor at the camp, 
said he misses the quiet life the abbey offers the rest of the year. But, he 
said, "we are called to both the contemplative and the active life. During the 
summer the active part definitely kicks in."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the adjustments the clerics must make, Father Anthony Kopp said summer 
is his favorite time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are good kids; they appreciate what we do for them," said Kopp, 
assistant camp director. "It gives us a chance to be more active than we are 
during the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The abbey, run by priests from the Norbertine Order, is home to about 20 
priests and 30 seminarians studying to be priests. The summer camp gives 
seminarians an opportunity to work with youths, and the youths a glimpse of the 
lives of priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most of the campers are Catholic, some are unsure exactly what it is 
priests do when they aren't at Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they take vacations when we aren't here," said 7-year-old Benjamin 
McCabe of Anaheim. "It looks like an easy job." 
</P>
<P>
 But Joey Muckenthaler, 7, of Placentia, said the priests have to be "holy all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they have to pray a lot," Muckenthaler said. "They are always praying 
all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the activities at St. Michael's are similar to other summer camps. The 
boys play sports, take hikes, swim and hear stories around the campfire. 
</P>
<P>
 But one significant difference between St. Michael's and other camps occurs at 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
 At all three meals, the boys are expected to eat in silence. Using hand 
motions to communicate, campers listen to 20 minutes of classical music while 
eating. Offenders are given one warning, then asked to leave the table if they 
talk again. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerics at the abbey eat their midday meal in silence for religious 
reasons, but Kopp has a more pragmatic purpose for requiring the boys to keep 
the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for our own psychological well-being," Kopp said. "It helps keep us 
sane. It also has a calming effect on the boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Camper Brian Frees, 9, of Newport Beach, said having priests and seminarians 
as counselors was a little hard to get used to the first time he attended the 
camp two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you see they are just regular, real people," Frees said. "They are 
stricter about, you know, holy things like praying and Mass, but they're 
regular people." 
</P>
<P>
 The best part about camp, Frees said, is the combination of priests and 
nature.  
</P>
<P>
 "The priests talk about praying to God a lot while we are here," Frees said. 
"And at night, before you go to bed, you can see the stars. It makes you feel 
like God's really listening."

JUDGE UPHOLDS HIS ORDER FOR SPECIAL ELECTION IN FULLERTON; RULING: TWO RECALLED 
COUNCIL MEMBERS HAD PLEDGED NOT TO RUN IN NOVEMBER IF THE OCTOBER VOTE WERE 
ABOLISHED. STILL, THEY SAY THEY DO NOT PLAN TO SEEK REELECTION. 
</P>

<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge Tuesday upheld his own ruling, ordering 
a special October election to replace the three recalled members of the 
Fullerton City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Donald E. Smallwood denied the city's request that he reconsider last 
week's order that the city hold a special election on Oct. 18. Two of the 
council members who were recalled last month, Councilwoman Molly McClanahan and 
Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, had promised not to run for reelection in the 
November general election if the judge would rescind his order. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's hearing, McClanahan said she was disappointed with Smallwood's 
decision. But, she said, the decision will not affect her promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to run," McClanahan said. "I do not play games with the 
electorate, and my word is good." 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin said Tuesday that he also will not run for office in the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Recalls Committee had sued the city and City Clerk Anne M. York 
over a decision to have a special City Council election coincide with the 
November general election. Committee members were outraged over the 
consolidation of the elections because that would keep the recalled council 
members in office a few weeks longer and would leave McClanahan and Catlin 
eligible to seek reelection.  
</P>
<P>
 But by law, McClanahan, Catlin and the third recalled council member, Don 
Bankhead, may not run in the special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever replaces Bankhead will serve until his term expires in 1996. Those who 
replace McClanahan and Catlin will serve for about two weeks, because their 
terms expire in November. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they wanted to consolidate the two elections to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 7 recall election cost the city about $129,000 and the October 
special election is expected top $117,000, McClanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's atrocious," she said. "I'd rather spend the money on library 
books." 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan added that Smallwood's ruling will be confusing to voters because 
they now will be asked to go to the polls twice in two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council next week will consider whether to appeal, City Atty. R.K. 
(Kerry) Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Smallwood said in his ruling that any appeal "shall not operate as a 
stay of execution in that the court finds that the (Fullerton voters) would 
suffer irreparable damage" by being denied the right to a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen Recalls Committee members left the courtroom pleased with the 
judge's decision. Their attorney, Mark S. Rosen, called it "a 100% total 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is clear-cut," Rosen said. "There should be no dispute. The city 
should have called (an October) election in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 W. Snow Hume, Recalls Committee secretary, said the committee would not 
tolerate a consolidated election. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do so would be to condone an illegal act. . . . We cannot be bought. We're 
not for sale at any price." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Tuesday, York opened the filing period for nomination papers for the 
Oct. 18 special election. 
</P>
<P>
 She said 14 people have taken out papers to run. The filing deadline is Aug. 
11 at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be very, very expensive," said York, the only one of the 
four city officials who survived recall in the June 7 election. "I'm just going 
to run the elections and do what I'm directed to do at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort began last year when Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead voted 
for a 2% utility tax, despite opposition from hundreds of residents.

WITNESS MARRIES SHOOTING DEFENDANT; COURTS: MARCIE JAMES STUNS PROSECUTORS IN 
TESTIFYING SHE WED NEWBURY PARK HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STAR LEODES VAN BUREN ON 
JULY 8. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The key witness against a football star accused of shooting up a Newbury Park 
house last April stunned prosecutors Tuesday by testifying that she is now the 
defendant's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcie James, 20, told a Ventura County Superior Court jury that she wed 
Newbury Park High School football star Leodes Van Buren in Las Vegas on July 8 
-- three months to the day after he allegedly fired a bullet through her back 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me about 15 seconds to collect my wits," Deputy Dist. Atty. James 
Grunert said after the disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 James said she married Van Buren in an attempt to regain custody of the 
couple's 2-year-old daughter. She said she granted her parents legal custody 
immediately after the girl was born to make the child eligible for the 
grandparents' health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, a 19-year-old standout wide receiver, planned to attend the 
University of Colorado on a football scholarship this fall. But since the 
shooting, the university has said he is not academically eligible, and Van 
Buren has said he wants out of the letter of intent he signed with the school. 
</P>
<P>
 James was the first witness Tuesday when Van Buren went on trial on a felony 
charge of shooting at an occupied dwelling. No one was hurt in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the April 8 attack, she testified, she told her parents and 
police that Van Buren had fired the gun through the back door. She said he was 
angry that she would not let him inside to discuss their breakup the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 But in police interviews and court testimony since then, James has given 
differing accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 9, James testified Tuesday, she told her parents and investigators 
that another man, one she had never seen before, actually fired the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in an interview with investigators on May 4, James changed her story 
again, she acknowledged Tuesday. This time, she told police that Van Buren 
acted alone and that he had threatened her life and the lives of her family 
members since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 At the preliminary hearing in Municipal Court on May 26, James again reversed 
her statements, insisting that Van Buren did not fire at the Newbury Park home. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Tuesday, she testified that a companion of the defendant had fired at 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't have said Leodes did it, but I did," James told the jury, adding 
that she had been angry with the defendant for cheating on her. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney John B. Miller of Woodland Hills said he knew a week ago 
about his client's Las Vegas wedding. But he said he decided not to assert the 
defendant's right not to have his wife testify against him. To do so, he said, 
might suggest that James was hiding something. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have backfired," Miller said. "We're going on the facts (of the 
shooting), not on the fact they were married." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Grunert said because all of the incidents surrounding the case 
occurred before the wedding, the testimony would be allowed in any case. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of the shooting, Ventura County sheriff's deputies arrested Van 
Buren at his home while he was on the phone confessing the crime to an 
emergency 911 dispatcher, Grunert said in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor plans to call the dispatcher to the witness stand today. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators testified Tuesday that Van Buren, who faces up to seven years in 
prison if convicted, also confessed to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I don't deny it,' " Deputy Larry House told jurors. "That's a 
quotation." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies also testified Tuesday that they found a bullet inside the 
defendant's car and a handgun case under the mattress in his bedroom after Van 
Buren gave them permission to search his room and car. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren grew up in South-Central Los Angeles, but moved to the Newbury Park 
home of his sixth-grade teacher, Kenneth McGee, when McGee offered to provide 
him a safer upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren had a state-record 269 receptions and 4,456 yards receiving during 
his prep career.

COMMUNITY MEMORIAL SUES COUNTY HOSPITAL; VENTURA: FACILITY CLAIMS PUBLIC CENTER 
IS INCREASINGLY VYING FOR PRIVATELY INSURED CLIENTS. ACTION CAPS 18 MONTHS OF 
ACRIMONY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Saying that Ventura County Medical Center has overstepped its legal role of 
treating the poor, rival Community Memorial Hospital filed suit Tuesday to stop 
the nearby public hospital's alleged competition for privately insured 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit caps 18 months of acrimony between the two hospitals, located just 
three blocks apart in central Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial is seeking a Superior Court order that would keep the 
county hospital from accepting privately insured patients who could be served 
at private hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also seeks to force the county hospital to treat more patients who 
are uninsured or unable to pay -- its state mandate as a provider of last 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 And Community Memorial demands that the county begin sending more patients 
insured under state Medi-Cal to private hospitals -- a request prompted by 
insurance cutbacks that have led to a shrunken pool of patients. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, Community Memorial has waged an increasingly public 
battle with the county hospital over its plans to add a new 105,000-square-foot 
wing. But attorneys for Community Memorial said Tuesday that their lawsuit is 
about more than the proposed renovation and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real focus of this lawsuit is about the county's proper role in providing 
health care," Los Angeles lawyer John E. McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
 But county hospital officials said they have never sought private patients, do 
not treat many and have no plan to compete for them against private doctors and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not go after the private sector," hospital Administrator Pierre Durand 
said. "Most of our private sector insurance comes through the emergency room or 
neonatal care. Our system targets the poor, the indigent and the Medi-Cal 
(patients). Our statistics show that." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10% of the patients served by the county hospital have private insurance, 
Durand said. That percentage has not changed much even with a new county plan 
that allows county employees to receive treatment at the public hospital and 
its numerous clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully 70% of county hospital patients are insured by Medi-Cal, Durand said. 
Another 8% are covered by Medicare. The remaining 12% of patients are unwilling 
or unable to pay, and cost the county $20 million to $24 million each year, 
Durand said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the private nonprofit Community Memorial Hospital spends only 
about $300,000 a year on indigent patients, according to Durand. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial spokesman Donald Benton said that only about 3% of his 
hospital's patients are insured by Medi-Cal, although that number is expected 
to increase because the hospital recently signed a Medi-Cal contract with the 
state. Only 1% to 2% of the hospital's patients are indigent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State figures show that only 0.2% of Community Memorial's patients were 
indigent in the 12-month period ending last September. 
</P>
<P>
 According to McDermott, the county hospital system has increasingly competed 
for the fully insured private patients who are private hospitals' lifeblood. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer pointed to a plan approved by the Board of Supervisors last fall 
that for the first time allows the county's 6,000 employees to go to county 
facilities for hospitalization and basic treatment. About 1,000 employees have 
chosen that lower-cost option, and Community Memorial has lost patients as a 
direct result, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott noted that the county recently opened new clinics in Simi Valley and 
Thousand Oaks and is planning three more in Oxnard, Fillmore and Moopark. It 
already has clinics in Ventura, Oxnard and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Community Memorial claims that the county hospital attracts 
private patients in other ways as well -- and deliberately shirks its 
responsibility to treat the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians at the county's clinics get extra pay for referring privately 
insured patients to Ventura County Medical Center, which is prohibited by state 
anti-kickback laws, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Ventura, ambulances take patients from some of the city's poorer 
neighborhoods to Community Memorial, while transporting some more affluent 
patients to the county hospital, the suit maintains. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials acknowledge that doctors at county clinics do get extra pay 
when they treat their patients -- both rich and poor -- at the county hospital. 
But they say that is the only logical way to compensate the clinic physicians 
for services. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way our doctors get paid," said Samuel Edwards, medical director 
at the county hospital. "How else do you pay a clinic doctor (whose patients 
are on Medi-Cal)?" 
</P>
<P>
 County Health Care Agency Director Phillipp K. Wessels has said that it is 
also true that some poor patients are routed to Community Memorial, but only to 
correct a past imbalance in the number of emergency patients sent to the 
private hospital.

COUNCIL POSTPONES DISPUTED HOUSING ALLOCATION VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most anticipated decisions of the year in Ventura -- which 
developers get permission to build housing in the city -- will have to wait 
until Aug. 29, bleary-eyed council members said at 2 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ties loosened, hair tousled, the seven-member council agreed to put off 
distributing this year's housing allocations rather than continue their meeting 
until sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to come back to this with a clear mind and a good attitude," 
Councilman Jim Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was to have decided the fate of 11 development proposals before 
the city, though many of the 60 people lined up to address the council came for 
only one issue: the land swap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week's meeting added yet another twist to that controversial saga, 
which council members may also have to address when they reconvene next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Ron Hertel's proposal to swap his land for the city's, trading $2 
million for a community park in exchange for permission to build 437 homes on a 
city-owned lemon orchard, has pitted eastside sports enthusiasts against open 
space preservationists and neighbors of the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
 Local real estate broker Barry Moore has spoken for the last two weeks of his 
anonymous clients who say they can offer the city a better deal than Hertel. 
Tuesday morning, under pressure from Councilman Steve Bennett, he revealed the 
clients' names: the Santana Family Trust, a local farming partnership, and 
Dallas-based Centex Corp., the nation's largest home builder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santanas now lease the city's 87-acre lemon orchard at Telegraph Road and 
Petit Avenue -- the same land Hertel wants to swap and they want to buy. Jaime 
Santana approached Centex officials at their Antelope Valley office last spring 
with the idea. The project would be Centex's first venture in Ventura County, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their offer for the city is this: the Santanas and Centex purchase an 80-acre 
strawberry farm at the southwest corner of Kimball and Telephone roads, which 
they then sell to Ventura as a community park for $4.5 million. At the same 
time, the development partners buy Ventura's lemon orchard for $8.7 million, 
thus leaving the city with a net of about $4.2 million toward a park. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city ever wanted a larger park, Santana said the owners of 50 acres of 
farmland to the east of the strawberry farm have expressed interest in selling 
their land. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer is only good, of course, if the lemon orchard comes with housing 
allocations attached, Santana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Hertel's land, at the northwest corner of Telephone and Kimball Roads, 
and the city's property and the strawberry farm are zoned agricultural until 
2010. The council would have to amend Ventura's General Plan before any homes 
could be built on any of the sites within the next 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Santana said he did not make his proposal earlier because he never dreamed the 
Hertel offer would garner the attention it has. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think the city was going to take Ron Hertel's offer seriously," he 
said. "I thought this was an insult, to offer the city $2 million and land that 
is worth $35,000 per acre (for the city's property)." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Hertel Constructors, the developer's company, have insisted in 
the past that their property is worth $65,000 an acre. Tuesday afternoon, 
however, the company's vice president said the actual value may be closer to a 
local real estate broker's estimate of $40,000 to $50,000 per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwin Nutt, a Fillmore-based agent who has sold agricultural land in the 
county for 40 years, said the parcel is worth a bit more than most county 
farmland because it is situated in the city and could conceivably be developed 
one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly right," said Tom Crozier, Hertel Constructors' vice president, 
of Nutt's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Crozier said he still does not have enough information about the new offer to 
judge if it is a credible one. "Possibly yes, possibly no," he said. "I just 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel the Santanas and Centex are considering is across the street from 
the Hertel property. The strawberry farm in question does not yet belong, 
however, to either the Santanas or Centex, but to another local farming trust 
called thH. Smith Family Partnership. Greg Smith, one of the partnership's 
owners and managers, said he would be interested in an offer on his property. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, since the council zoned it agricultural years ago, meaning no one 
can develop it until 2010, few have been eager to buy his swatch of farmland 
surrounded by suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sort of in a limbo," he said. "It's hard to develop and it's hard to 
farm. This has placed us in a difficult position." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bennett, who has called for the city to consider other offers on 
its lemon orchard since Hertel presented his proposal in February, said the 
latest offer on the land proves he was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "This indicates that there is credible potential up there," he said. "I'm just 
interested in fair market return on our investment." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura Mayor Tom Buford said he was not bowled over by the new offer. "I 
don't know how seriously the council is going to take this," he said. "We can 
always go with Hertel's proposal and call for appraisals on both properties."

OXNARD SEEKS OUTSIDE AID FOR ROAD REPAIRS; HIGHWAYS: TAX WAS INITIALLY 
CONSIDERED FOR FREEWAY IMPROVEMENTS, BUT PUBLIC OUTCRY AND SLUGGISH ECONOMY 
FORCED OFFICIALS TO RECONSIDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After protests from developers and landowners over a proposed assessment 
district, Oxnard officials are seeking state and federal funding to help 
rebuild two overburdened Ventura Freeway exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway ramps at Rose and Rice avenues, built more than 30 years ago to 
accommodate farming traffic, are now jammed constantly with people visiting the 
Shopping at the Rose complex, Oxnard Outlet Center, Oxnard Auto Center and 
other new developments. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had sought to create a large assessment district for developers 
and homeowners to pay collectively for needed road improvements in northern 
Oxnard -- including the Ventura Freeway-Pacific Coast Highway interchange and a 
new bridge over the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sluggish economy has forced a change in plans, said Development 
Services Director Tim Nanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the original proposal, a special tax would have been levied on much of 
the city to raise $100 million for the projects. New developers and homeowners 
would have had to pay a portion of the road improvements when they broke 
ground, reducing the burden on the older landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an average economy, that works well because you can count on a number of 
developments each year," Nanson said. "But it wouldn't have worked well the way 
things are going now." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials currently are searching for federal and state grants and 
other outside funding for the freeway improvements, after protests from local 
homeowners, who were asked to pay 2% of the assessment fees, and developers, 
who said they could not afford to take on the costs of financing the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has not done away with its assessment plan altogether, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The large assessment district will be broken up into three smaller ones -- 
Rice Avenue, Rose Avenue and the Ventura Freeway-Pacific Coast Highway 
Interchange -- to make the road repair projects easier to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a work of art," Nanson said of the large district. "But it took a lot 
to explain, and it became unmanageable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Avenue project, expected to cost about $18 million, will still be 
primarily funded by Oxnard, Nanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials are looking for state and federal funds to pay for the 
majority of the Rice Avenue improvement plan, which should cost about $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rice avenue is of fundamental importance to Oxnard and even has county 
significance," Nanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the road could become a main artery if proposals to build a large 
regional airport at Point Mugu come to life. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said the congressman will try 
to secure $18 million in federal funding for Rice Avenue in a public works 
appropriation bill scheduled for consideration next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Ventura Freeway-Pacific Coast Highway connector, expected to cost more 
than $100 million, will be funded by Oxnard, Ventura and Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uncertainty over funding, all three projects should be completed 
before 2000, officials said.

ROCKET BOOSTER; MOON ASTRONAUT URGES RENEWED SPACE EXPLORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speaking in Simi Valley Tuesday, the last man to leave his footprints on the 
moon called for a renewed emphasis on space exploration as a way to advance 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to develop a national public awareness" of the benefits of space 
research, said former astronaut Eugene A. Cernan, who walked on the moon as 
part of Apollo 17's December, 1972, voyage -- mankind's last lunar trip. "The 
space program has done a very poor job . . . of developing an identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing more than 300 people at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and 
Museum, Cernan said that discoveries yet to be made in space will further 
technology, thereby working indirectly to solve problems such as homelessness, 
cancer, AIDS and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The silver-haired, 60-year-old Cernan, who now lives in Houston, Tex., came to 
the library in commemoration of last week's 25th anniversary of the first moon 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 40-minute speech, he recounted in detail his own 12-day voyage to the 
moon with fellow astronauts Ronald E. Evans and Harrison H. Schmitt. Then, 
still standing on the library's auditorium stage, Cernan took questions from 
would-be future astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were you afraid?" asked John Fatollahi, 7, of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe my heart was beating a little fast," Cernan admitted. "But I was glad 
to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy also wondered what would happen if the Earth was struck by a comet 
like the one that just hit Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we would look at the earthquake you guys experienced here as a 
very minor infraction," the astronaut replied. 
</P>
<P>
 A priest from Santa Barbara wanted to know whether the moon landing made 
Cernan want to talk with God. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was inspired. I was convinced that there is a God," Cernan responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest, Father Antonio Cacciapuoti of St. Raphael Church, said later that 
he has always been fascinated by astronauts. As a boy in 1969 in Naples, Italy, 
he recalled, he left a soccer game to run home and watch the first Americans 
walking on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Space fan Mike Bliss, 51, of Simi Valley, confessed that he harbored doubts 
about whether man actually had walked on the moon. He asked Cernan why 
photographs of the moon show different colors on the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
 His skepticism was somewhat diminished, he said, by Cernan's explanation: "On 
the moon you do see shades of gray," Cernan said, adding that solar radiation 
causes changes in color. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-year-old Sam Rosenblum of Thousand Oaks stole the show with his question 
about how one goes to the bathroom in space. 
</P>
<P>
 An amused Cernan -- who said he had been asked the same question countless 
times -- told the boy that urine is dispensed into space, where it turns to ice 
crystals. Solid waste is kept in bags that are stored in a pressurized 
compartment "because for some reason doctors want to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The ideas of today's children will determine the direction of the space 
program in coming decades, Cernan said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BOY'S LIFE DEPENDS ON DONOR GIFT

 John Le says wants to get well and grow up a little so he can earn enough 
money to go to Disneyland. But if that is to happen, the 4-year-old must find a 
bone marrow donor. 
</P>
<P>
 John has aplastic anemia, a fatal blood disease, and a bone marrow transplant 
could save his life, said Tim Vuong, a Children's Hospital of Orange County 
spokesman. But none of the potential donors in the national bone marrow 
registry match John. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could give up my life to save my son's, I would," said John's father, 
Loi Le. 
</P>
<P>
 John, who likes playing cards, riding his bicycle and watching race-car 
movies, is living with his parents, sister and brother in an uncle's home in 
Westminster. His father said he has been unemployed for two years because of 
physical disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Loi Le said John constantly feels as if "ants are crawling all over his 
bones." 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts me to see him in pain," Le said. "I hope we can find a donor." 
</P>
<P>
 A match is more likely to be found among the Asian community, Vuong said. 
Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches will sponsor a donor testing Saturday for 
John, who is Vietnamese American. The event will take place from 5:30 to 8:30 
p.m. at La Purisima Church in Orange. Asian Americans are especially being 
asked to get tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to get more Asians to donate bone marrow," Vuong said. "There is 
a big shortage of donors in the Asian community." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are tested at Saturday's event will be added to the national bone 
marrow registry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said a person's bone marrow is genetically inherited, so 
when no matching sibling is available, the best chance for a match lies in 
finding someone with the same racial or ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
 La Purisima is at 11712 Hewes St. Information: (714) 898-1526. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; COUNCIL APPROVES CITY SMOKING LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved an ordinance that prohibits smoking 
in buildings and vehicles owned by the city or leased to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's unanimous vote came despite the recent adoption of a state law that 
bans smoking in virtually all places of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the ordinance is necessary because the state anti-smoking 
law will not take effect until Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the ordinance for final approval on Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Robert C. Dunek said the ordinance will be unnecessary once the 
state law takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the ordinance could serve as a kind of a "backstop" because, if 
the state law is modified by a court or changed by the Legislature in the 
future, the city would still have its own anti-smoking ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, an initiative sponsored by the tobacco industry is on the November 
ballot that would eliminate the power of local governments to regulate the sale 
of cigarettes and other tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city ordinance, smoking will be prohibited in enclosed areas, such 
as offices, rooms, chambers, dining areas, hallways, meeting places and 
vehicles that are owned by the city or leased to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, smoking is allowed in certain areas, including private offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would also authorize Dunek or a designated city official to post 
signs allowing smoking at rooms A and B of the Community Center during bingo 
games. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; OFFICIAL: LIBRARY NOT APPLYING VOLUNTEERS

<P>
 Councilwoman Joanne Coontz told her colleagues on the City Council that she is 
concerned about possible waste of volunteer talent at the library and asked the 
city manager to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents who wanted to volunteer at the library during the past year 
had been told that the most they could hope to do is stack books, Coontz said 
during Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of these people have qualifications that extend beyond stacking 
books," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Services Director Gary Wann was in the audience and said afterward 
that he was "shocked" by the charge. Volunteers are needed for a variety of 
tasks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a campaign to get as many quality volunteers as possible," he said. 
"They are going to be a significant component of how we deliver service." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has cut deeply into the library's budget and the staff has dropped 
from 82 to 42 in the past year and a half, Wann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coontz said that the city is relying more heavily on volunteers in every 
department, from City Hall to the Police Department. "But the success of the 
program has a lot to do with what they are going to let people do," she said. 
"We have to change our attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Wann said the library has procedures for accepting volunteers and that the 
staff may not have explained those adequately to people who offered help. 
</P>
<P>
 The need and desire for qualified volunteers to help in a number of areas has 
only grown, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The library will be particularly dependent on volunteers when it extends by 12 
the weekly hours of operation at each branch starting in August. "We are going 
to cover every area," he said." LESLEY WRIGHT

 Construction work by Pacific Bell in placing new, high-tech underground cables 
in part of the city is scheduled to begin in August, City Manager Fred Maley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect any major (traffic) problems," Maley said.He said work is 
scheduled to be completed by early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell is installing a combination of fiber optic and coaxial cables in 
about 40% of the city, in the area south of Santiago Boulevard. Installation of 
the new cables in the remainder of the city is scheduled in 1996. Some of the 
new cables in Villa Park will be on overhead wires, replacing older, existing 
overhead cables. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a modernization effort," said James Bass, a regional manager for Pacific 
Bell. He described the new cables as being "state of the art" and able to carry 
up to 500 television stations. BILL BILLITER

<P>
 The issue of Buddhist temples in residential neighborhoods will be discussed 
at a community forum for the local Vietnamese American community Thursday at 
the Community Meeting Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Community policing, land-use ordinances and the city's general plan also will 
be discussed during the 7 p.m. forum.One of the invited guests is Councilman 
Tony Lam of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two months, members of the Vietnamese American community have 
complained that the city is cracking down on Buddhist temples in residential 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have asked the Bat Nha Buddhist Temple on West Street to stop 
services after it was found to be operating without a permit. Temple officials 
sued the city, claiming that the city is violating the congregation's 
constitutional rights by ordering the temple to close. The case is still 
pending.  
</P>
<P>
 Development Services Director David Kennon will talk about city regulations 
concerning churches and temples, which the city code allows within residential 
areas but only under strict conditions, including a requirement that the land 
should be at least one acre. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT FOR LEG DRUG STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Researchers at UCI Medical Center are looking for 25 volunteers to participate 
in a study of a drug that may relieve a potentially debilitating leg condition. 
</P>
<P>
 People with the condition, called intermittent claudication, experience 
aching, cramping and sometimes severe pain when they walk, but feel fine while 
at rest, research coordinator Judith Hopkins said.The symptoms are caused by 
atherosclerosis, a narrowing in the blood vessels due to plaque or fatty 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 The medication under study, cilostazol, enlarges the blood vessels slightly 
and prevents plaque from collecting against vessel walls. The drug will not 
cure atherosclerosis, but it may relieve symptoms, Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 14-week study, funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. of Rockville, 
Md., participants will be given the medication or a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants must be at least 40 years old, have symptoms of claudication, and 
have their own transportation to and from UCI Medical Center in Orange for the 
weekday tests. Reimbursement for transportation costs is available. People 
interested in participating should contact Hopkins at (714) 456-8359.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ROSSMOOR; PERIMETER WALL ISSUE TOPIC OF HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public hearing will be held today on whether to place a proposal on the 
November ballot asking homeowners if they are willing to pay a special tax for 
the repair and maintenance of the Rossmoor perimeter wall. 
</P>
<P>
 A 100-foot section of the red brick wall was damaged during an earthquake in 
1992 and has not been repaired because public agencies, including the county, 
have refused to pay for the costs, estimated at more than $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A ballot measure would need approval by two-thirds of those who vote, because 
it is a tax measure, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, officials of the Rossmoor Homeowners Assn. have 
lobbied the Rossmoor Community Services District, which runs this 
unincorporated community of more than 5,000 homes, to take over the 1 1/2-mile 
wall built in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Bailey, president of the homeowners group, said that the wall has a 
historic value to the community, and residents have indicated in several 
surveys that that it should be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 But the wall has become a hot potato among the community services district, 
county and the cities of Seal Beach and Los Alamitos, all of which have refused 
to take responsibility for its repair and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that the wall runs along public and private property 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain sections are close to county flood control channels, while parts of 
the wall are within Seal Beach and Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters decide to take over the wall, Seal Beach and Los Alamitos are 
expected to cede their portions of the wall to the district, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters also will be asked if the district should add the repair and 
maintenance of the wall to its current duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the district is responsible for such services as sweeping and trash 
collection, lighting, and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The maintenance issue requires only a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But both measures must be approved for the work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing will be at 7 p.m. at the Rossmoor Community Service 
District office at 3232 Hedwig Road. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; COUNCILWOMAN WILL RUN FOR REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Patricia Bates said this week that she will run for 
reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 If reelected, Bates said, she will focus on privatization, youth involvement 
and future development of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, which the 
federal government plans to close. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be a continuity in leadership," said Bates, who has been on the 
council since the city's incorporation in 1989. "We've been on the cutting edge 
of new technology in privatization. That's an important mission since there is 
a continual problem with revenues at the county and state government level." 
</P>
<P>
 As the council's representative to the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, Bates 
organized a well-attended town hall meeting on alternatives for developing the 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 The council seat held by Councilman James F. Krembas also will be decided in 
November. Krembas has not said whether he plans to run again. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; BALBOA BAY CLUB REBUILDING OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As expected, the City Council on Monday night unanimously approved plans to 
demolish and rebuild much of the luxurious Balboa Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials say the extensive remodeling effort will open the 46-year-old 
private club to the public for the first time and give it a more modern look. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fabulous," Beverly Ray, owner of the Balboa Bay Club, said of the 
Monday meeting. "There was such an outpouring of support for the plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of residents and local business owners spoke in favor, saying the 
design will improve the club's look and open up views from houses perched on 
the inland bluffs overlooking the club and the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The project calls for an expansion of the club from 155,000 square feet to 
189,000 square feet and will add a members-only athletic facility and a public 
restaurant, coffee shop, two bars, a ballroom and four conference rooms, said 
Dave Wooten, club president. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a waterfront garden, public walkways and a hotel open to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, a $60-million plan to remodel the Balboa Bay Club was 
rejected by the City Council because it would have made the club too large. 
That plan, which would have nearly doubled the size of the club, drew vehement 
opposition from nearby residents whose views of the ocean and the harbor would 
have been obstructed by new, larger structure. The City Council rejected the 
plan on a 4-3 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, dozens of residents who live within sight of the club were 
more agreeable to the club's revamped efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 "People have said that the Bay Club is controversial. I don't think that is 
so," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray said she walked Kings Road about three months ago in an effort to convince 
residents that the new plans would not only modernize the club but, in many 
cases, improve their ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew what people's concerns were," Ray said, explaining why the new plans 
passed the council without much controversy. BOB ELSTON

<P>
 The powerful Pony League baseball all-star team took fourth place in the 
Whittier sectional tournament this weekend, earning the league a first-ever 
berth in the regional tournament in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The team got off to a bad start in the Whittier tournament, losing its first 
game 10-0 to Garden Grove.Eight of the Garden Grove runs came in the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 14-year-old baseball standouts "came back like gangbusters on 
Saturday" in the words of team manager Tom Grzecka. They beat La Mirada 8-3. 
Outfielder John Dabbs led the offense, going 4 for 4 with a double, three 
singles and three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had very good community support," Grzecka said. "A tremendous number of 
people drove the 60 miles to Whittier to see us play." 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-4 loss to Whittier on Sunday spelled the end of Laguna Niguel's chances 
for placing higher than fourth in the eight-team tournament. The team had 
entered the Whittier tournament undefeated, having soundly beaten three 
opponents in the district tournament by 10 runs apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel will play its first game of the regional tournament Friday at 8 
p.m. LYNN FRANEY

<P>
 A fund has been established for a 7-year-old boy who was critically injured 
July 11 when a stolen Mercedes slammed into his family's station wagon at an 
Irvine intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent McGee remains hospitalized but is slowly recovering from his injuries, 
family friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund will help the McGee family pay medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the driver of the Mercedes, John Eric Phelps, a 31-year-old Dana 
Point resident, broadsided the McGee car at the intersection of Jeffrey Road 
and Irvine Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of the crash pushed the station wagon against a traffic median. 
Trent's mother, Cheryl McGee, and his 10-year-old sister were not hurt, but 
Trent suffered severe head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Phelps sped through three red lights before hitting the McGee car. 
Phelps was arrested and charged with suspicion of felony hit-and-run, evading 
arrest, grand theft auto and reckless driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund was set up at Great Western Bank, 3978 Barranca Parkway, Irvine 
92714. The account number is 1841854192. SHELBY GRAD

ON-TIME PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS ARE HIGHEST SINCE '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A near record number of Orange County residents are paying their property 
taxes on time. 
</P>
<P>
 The county treasurer-tax collector's office reported Tuesday that in the first 
six months of the year, only 3.4% of the property taxes were delinquent -- the 
lowest level since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would almost appear from these figures that Orange County's economy took a 
change for the better," County Treasurer Robert L. Citron said in his tax 
report.  
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, county officials had blamed the recession for 
hurting their efforts to collect property taxes. The delinquency level peaked 
in 1993 at 4.4%, but the receipts started showing improvement with the 
collection of more than $1.85 billion this fiscal year. DOREEN CARVAJAL

PEDESTRIAN, 12, FATALLY STRUCK IN 2-CAR COLLISION

 A 12-year-old boy was killed Tuesday when he was sideswiped by a car as he 
stood on Seal Beach Boulevard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Schneider died at Long Beach Memorial Hospital at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A 36-year-old Westminster man, whom police have not identified, was critically 
injured when his Mitsubishi was sideswiped by a Mercedes, which in turn caused 
him to lose control and hit the boy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Mercedes, who police said caused the accident and left the 
scene, was later arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run, felony driving 
under the influence and driving with a suspended license, said Sgt. Donald Dye. 
Vehicular homicide will probably be added to the initial charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Mercedes, Cynthia Kaye Lietz, 28, of Seal Beach, was to be 
transferred to the Orange County Jail Thursday night, Dye said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cars were traveling north on Seal Beach Boulevard about 4:30 p.m., 
police said. The Mercedes reportedly sideswiped the Mitsubishi, forcing it 
toward the curb at the intersection with Bolsa Avenue. After Schneider was 
struck, the Mitsubishi continued for about 70 feet until it struck a lamppost.

CONSIDER THE RISKS BEFORE CO-SIGNING LOAN FOR RELATIVES OR FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have a heart, but use your head -- and watch your wallet! 
</P>
<P>
 That's the not-so-simple advice you must try to follow whenever a friend or 
relative asks you the large favor of co-signing for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of those delicate moments in life when your common sense, and your 
emotional sensibilities, may pull you hard in opposite directions at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 How you answer comes down to a personal decision. But on one point the experts 
agree: No matter what your reasons for doing so, you should enter into such a 
deal with your eyes wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Co-signing a loan puts your credit on the line," points out TRW Information 
Systems & Services, the credit reporting firm, in a current consumer-finance 
bulletin. "Some people who co-sign loans don't take it seriously enough because 
they don't understand all their obligations." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of co-signing is simple: to help someone you care about and trust get 
access to credit that lenders won't extend on the strength of the borrower's 
qualifications alone. 
</P>
<P>
 When you co-sign the loan contract, you promise to pay off the debt if the 
borrower fails to make good on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't co-sign any loan unless you know the borrower well, have good reason to 
believe he or she will repay it, and are prepared to repay the loan yourself if 
necessary," says Grace Weinstein in her Lifetime Book of Money Management. 
</P>
<P>
 If you determine that you are willing to co-sign, experts add, check the whole 
deal over thoroughly before you put your name on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, you will be aware in advance, for example, that you may be dunned 
even if the primary borrower misses just one payment, and even if there is 
collateral, such as a car or boat, pledged on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of a car loan, for example," says TRW, "the lender might demand 
payment from you instead of repossessing the car. And even if the car is 
repossessed, its value may not be sufficient to pay off the loan." 
</P>
<P>
 Before you sign, furthermore, you want to make certain that the contract 
doesn't use any of your assets, such as your own car or house, as security for 
the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting you for payments that haven't been made, the lender may also dip 
into your pocketbook for late fees, collection costs and extra interest 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, TRW says, co-signers need to bear in mind that the promise they make can 
affect their own credit standing, regardless of whether the primary borrower 
ever misses a payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it is not delinquent, a co-signed loan is part of your credit 
history," TRW notes. "That could cause problems if you wish to obtain a new 
loan for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since financial institutions consider a co-signed loan your responsibility, 
they'll include it when calculating your debt-to-income ratio. This ratio is an 
important factor that financial institutions consider when deciding whether to 
grant a loan." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all these problems and pitfalls, the case for co-signing may look 
compelling if, say, you want to help a child qualify for credit for the first 
time, or support a valued friend recovering from a layoff or other financial 
setback. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in such cases, however, you might check alternative ways to accomplish 
the same mission, such as a gift of assets that helps the borrower obtain 
secured credit on his or her own. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do in borderline cases where the decision seems too tough to make? 
</P>
<P>
 Says TRW: "If in doubt, don't co-sign a loan."

WATERFORD STEMS RED INK, BUT AT EXPENSE OF IRISH WORKERS; GLASS: CRYSTAL MAKER 
RECOVERS BY CUTTING HOME WORK FORCE, MARKETING CHEAPER FOREIGN PRODUCT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To most people, the chunk of crystal sitting on the table looks like a big ice 
cube, but Fred Curtis envisions a winged horse. The hard part, he says, will be 
sculpting the fragile front legs without breaking them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll wait till the place is empty at night and work here in the silence," 
Curtis tells a visitor to the Waterford Crystal plant. "This will be 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 In another room, engraver Tom Hayes balks at putting a price on a fancy 
crystal globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not being glib, but something's worth what people will pay for it," Hayes 
says. "We're trying to create an art." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis and Hayes are two of the Irish master craftsmen who make Waterford 
crystal a household name. They are also two of the fortunate ones -- economic 
realities have left hundreds of other Irish craftsmen out of work as the 
company adjusts to a more competitive global marketplace, in part by marketing 
cheaper crystal from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterford Wedgwood PLC ran into trouble when the recession left it staggering 
under yearly losses of around 20 million Irish pounds, the equivalent of $30 
million. Investors led by Irish tycoon Tony O'Reilly and Wall Street powerhouse 
Morgan Stanley & Co. bought a 29% stake in 1990 and put the company on a new 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three years, they had erased the losses and earned 9 million Irish 
pounds in 1993. That brought the company's stock price back from 14 pence two 
years ago to nearly four times as much these days. 
</P>
<P>
 But success has come painfully. Hundreds of Irish workers lost their jobs as 
Waterford cut costs and started buying cheaper crystal from sources in Germany 
and Slovenia -- and gained a bigger share of the vital U.S. market under an 
also-ran brand name, Marquis by Waterford. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's saving from manufacturing overseas is substantial. Every time 
Waterford sells a $30 wine glass under the Marquis name, it makes more money 
than it does by selling a $50 Waterford wine glass. 
</P>
<P>
 At Waterford Wedgwood's recent annual meeting in Dublin, shareholders were 
relieved to be back in the black. But amid the expected gripes about big stock 
options for directors and the predictable clamoring for a dividend -- the 
company's hasn't paid one since 1988 -- were calls to bring jobs back to 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment, officially listed at 15.2% but widely believed to be nearer 20%, 
is Ireland's top problem and an emotional issue -- even to Irish investors who 
profit when jobs are exported. 
</P>
<P>
 "I propose we take our money out of Germany, that doesn't need it, and put it 
back in Ireland, with our unemployment," said a shareholder who did not 
identify herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Waterford Wedgwood shareholders are concerned that selling cheaper 
crystal could hurt the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that the integrity of the brand is in grave danger if we reduce 
the number of craft workers," said Neal Duggan, a Dublin accountant. "We're in 
danger of eroding the brand." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Reilly, now chairman of Waterford Wedgwood, said Waterford's share of the 
key U.S. crystal market had advanced from 27% in 1990, the year before the 
European imports were added to the line, to 34% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a fool could not understand those numbers -- this company was headed for 
liquidation," said O'Reilly, who also runs Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterford's chief executive, Paddy Galvin, agreed in an interview that the 
Irish shareholders "make comments with their hearts, not with their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Waterford not cut its work force to 1,500 from 3,000 over the past few 
years, slashed pay and brought in cheaper foreign crystal, the plant would have 
closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes have been bitter for Waterford's workers. But union leaders at the 
crystal plant put off repeated requests from the Associated Press to discuss 
the matter in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ordinary Irish cringe when asked about Waterford's bringing in cheaper 
crystal from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having a Rolls-Royce made in Japan," said Dublin native Anthony 
Campion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a risk they dilute the brand name," agreed Allison Stewart, a 
marketing consultant in London. "The way they can prevent that risk is to throw 
money at the Marquis range and brand it differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Galvin said Waterford makes sure there is no confusion, insisting, for 
example, that retailers display the brands on different shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're paranoid about quality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company contends that high-quality products, hand-made by such craftsmen 
as Curtis and Hayes, will keep the Waterford name in good repute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prestigious pieces are creating a halo effect, which is counteracting any 
negative that might be perceived as you go downscale," Galvin said.

THE UGLY TRUTH; QUEST TO PHOTOGRAPH LOVE TURNS INTO PASSION TO SAVE WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lisa was a sexy, disco-dancing mother of five. 
</P>
<P>
 Garth was a lanky, big-money engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 They represented the "perfect couple" to a wide-eyed photographer shooting the 
glamorous life in her native America for a Japanese magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Donna Ferrato caught the glamorous husband beating the glamorous wife 
one spring night at their eight-room home outside New York City. Ferrato 
crouched, snapped her trusty Leica and then tried unsuccessfully to stop the 
heavy, left-handed blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrato, now 45, will never forget how her quest to document love 13 years ago 
broke her heart and changed her focus from romance to abuse. She hopes America 
won't forget, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The O.J. Simpson saga has helped her cause. Ferrato's rare black-and-white 
images on spousal abuse are hot, circulating on television, in magazines and in 
newspapers. One of her photos appeared on the July 4 Time magazine cover; her 
photo book "Living With the Enemy" (Aperture, 1991) is beginning its third 
printing; and she gets media calls for her own portrait. But this New Yorker 
would gladly decline the attention in favor of even more publicity for her 
obsession: "wife beating," as she calls it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis is finally focusing on the men who do this," Ferrato says in her 
girlish, staccato voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, she couldn't find a soul to publish her cold, violent pictures 
back in the early '80s. Nonetheless, while accepting other assignments to pay 
the bills, she made documenting domestic violence her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world has finally caught up with what Donna has been doing for more than 
10 years," says Peter Howe, former director of photography for Life magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrato is so gung-ho about the issue that she pairs her journalism with 
activism: She has spent at least 4,000 hours chronicling the effects of spousal 
abuse. She lectures passionately on the topic. And in 1991, she opened the 
nonprofit Domestic Abuse Awareness Project in a two-cubicle flat in Manhattan. 
The project floats two 50-photograph exhibitions around the country to raise 
funds for battered-women's shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 After 13 years of covering the issue, "How could I not have opinions?" Ferrato 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
 The night of the beating, Ferrato took one last picture of Lisa, who was 
crying on her knees in the couple's disco room. Months later, she found Lisa 
with a black eye. A year after the beating, Ferrato used the 20 beating 
pictures to persuade Lisa to carry through with her divorce from Garth, who was 
never arrested or charged with trying to hurt Lisa. (Ferrato used pseudonyms 
for the couple and is still selective about what she will reveal about them). 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrato never set out to photograph a man actually hitting a woman: "I didn't 
realize how dangerous it was," she says. Today, when she's on the spousal-abuse 
beat, she sticks with police, jails and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might shun Ferrato for stepping over the line of so-called objectivity, 
but her cold point of view has nonetheless graced Life, the New York Times 
Magazine, the Philadelphia Inquirer Magazine and others. She's taken home 
several honors, including the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award. And museum 
directors, photographic arts authorities and journalists agree Ferrato is one 
of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most interesting things about Donna is the way her photography and 
activism are hand in glove," Howe says. " . . . I would employ Donna because I 
want Donna Ferrato photographs." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Ferrato photographs are stark and sober views of black eyes, bruises, 
scars, swelling and fresh blood. The subjects come with names, faces and a 
lasting impression. The images are known to trigger a deep breath, boil blood 
and evoke tears. "Her pictures really aren't single images," says another 
former editor, "they're short stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrato has covered other assignments, from sex to Somalia. But when "Living 
With the Enemy" was published it solidified her reputation as the nation's 
resident photographer of spousal-abuse issues. It's a collection that includes 
the mass-media debut of Lisa and Garth, other battered women, their children 
and the men who destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrato was exposed to photography early, growing up in a wealthy doctors' 
neighborhood called "pill hill" in the Rust Belt town of Lorain, Ohio. Her 
father, an M.D., had a lot of love for his girl and two boys. There was a 
baseball diamond out back, a movie room inside, and the ever-present click of 
his own Leica. "I hated being posed," Ferrato says. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Ferrato brings a fly-on-the-wall style to her assignments. "She's much 
happier sleeping on a subject's couch than in a high-priced hotel room," Howe 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 She's 5-feet-4 and weighs 110 pounds. On assignments she wears black boots, 
blue jeans and a white T-shirt. She's discovered that red ("for the heart") and 
green ("for the mind") electrical tape on her $2,500 Leica puts subjects at 
ease: Where other photojournalists carry telephoto lenses that resemble heavy 
artillery, Ferrato's quiet little 35-mm camera looks like a broken toy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrato sometimes spends months with her subjects, and that's how she sees 
what many journalists don't: Reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be kept in the living room," she says, and then whispers, "I 
want to go into people's private places." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrato's persuasive powers are legendary. Aliza Sherman, 28, happily quit her 
job as a public-relations liaison for the likes of Def Leppard, Bruce Hornsby 
and Metallica to take over as director of Ferrato's nonprofit group. Ferrato 
talks her way into assignments and into the ugly truths of people's day-to-day 
lives. "She can talk her way into almost anywhere," Howe says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrato says her life's experiences have had a profound influence on her 
photography. She was raped as an arts-college student. Later, she nearly 
starved in Paris, but was saved by the kindness of suitors, bakers and people 
on the street. She was married for four years. She has a 12-year-old daughter. 
And after Ferrato started gaining fame for spousal-abuse photos, her own father 
revealed that her grandmother was beaten regularly by her late grandfather. 
"It's almost like every woman's experience," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been raised to nurture people and to take care of people," Ferrato says. 
"And that's what I do most -- I try to help people with my work." 
</P>
<P>
 Her work has gained status as a counterpart to literature and art. Ann Jones, 
who wrote "Women Who Kill" (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1980), a book about 
wives who murder in self defense, is a loyal fan. Ferrato's work was featured 
in 1993's Academy Award-winning documentary "Defending Our Lives," on the same 
topic. Her prints have even been lifted by students and up-and-coming artists. 
Ferrato is taking a woman to court for using copyright images in collages that 
were featured at a New York museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrato is still trying to find love. She says her time around battered women 
hasn't darkened her outlook. "That's what keeps me strong -- spending time 
looking for love," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she can't get Lisa and Garth off her mind. She still visits 
Lisa -- now a physical therapist who sometimes works with battered women. Garth 
remarried. He visits Lisa and the kids every so often and acts as though the 
violence never happened, Ferrato says. She would like to make a film 
documentary about the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot that I have not said about Garth that will probably come out 
someday," Ferrato says. " . . . The story's still not over."

THE UGLY TRUTH; 'I PUSHED THEM, I BIT THEM, I TORE THEIR CLOTHES' 
</P>

<P>
 John, 48, is a cameraman and documentary filmmaker who says he has abused 
women for most of his adult life.  
</P>
<P>
 His feelings of rage, which he was unable to curb for many years, led him to 
commit acts of violence that doomed his relationships.  
</P>
<P>
 About 10 years ago, after a particularly violent episode, he joined 
Alternatives to Violence, a therapy group for men who abuse women. It was 
founded and is led by Alyce LaViolette, and has offices in Long Beach and West 
Los Angeles . Most members of the group are there by court order, because they 
have battered their mates. John attended by choice for three years, and still 
returns whenever he feels himself slipping back into old patterns. He is making 
a documentary film about the group.  
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Times Staff Writer Bettijane Levine, he explains how it 
happened that the women he loved were the women he tried to hurt.  
</P>
<P>
 When did you first realize you were out of control? 
</P>
<P>
 It was at 2 a.m., about 10 years ago. My girlfriend and I were visiting New 
York. She was tired. I wanted us to have a drink at the hotel bar. I went down 
alone for a half-hour and came back hoping we'd make love, but she was already 
asleep. I got angry, started yelling and threw a clock at her. When she was up, 
I kept yelling, physically restrained her, pushed her around, hurt her. 
</P>
<P>
 You woke her up so you could fight? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I was a jerk. That was my prevailing MO with women. I pushed them, I bit 
them, I tore their clothes, I held them down. I did everything short of 
actually knocking them out. . . . Until that night, it never dawned on me that 
this was uncontrollable violence. 
</P>
<P>
 When did you first notice something wrong in your relationships? What was that 
first clue? 
</P>
<P>
 Yelling was the first thing I noticed, probably in my early 20s. It kind of 
built up from there. In the beginning, I thought it was something I could 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 But it went from yelling to restraining someone and holding her down. And then 
. . . in the pushing, or the wanting to be heard, or the anger about whatever 
it was -- some clothing would tear. Or I would throw things and break them. 
</P>
<P>
 I would get into this rage, this temper tantrum. Probably that came from when 
I was a kid, when it was my way of getting heard over my father, who was 
violent.  
</P>
<P>
 About 1980, I went to live in New York. My then-fiancee came to visit from Los 
Angeles. She wanted to go to the beach. She was used to getting in her car and 
driving to a beach in 15 minutes. I tried to explain it's more complicated than 
that in New York. . . . She wasn't understanding. I guess I was feeling 
inadequate that I couldn't just get her to the beach. We got into a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 I lifted up the two futon mattresses on which she was sitting and I threw her 
across the room in anger. I remember this was the first time I felt I was out 
of line. I had thrown her and hurt her. I realized there was nothing she'd done 
to offend me. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of times you tell yourself, ". . . It's she who is doing something to me 
that's causing me to be violent. This time I began to think, "Wait a minute, 
she wasn't doing anything. She just wanted to go to the beach." And I felt like 
I was my father. It was the first time I felt like my father had taken over 
inside of me. I was in my early 30s. 
</P>
<P>
 I moved back to Los Angeles and I started looking for some way to deal with my 
anger and rage. I was at the point where I wanted to talk with other men who 
had this problem.  
</P>
<P>
 Now I know it's partly insecurity. And that sometimes manifests itself as 
jealousy. I don't know where it comes from. I know my father used to express it 
with my mother when they were fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an alcoholic. He would be nice for weeks, then this tension would build 
up and he would lose it and blow his top and fight. He used to think my mother 
was having an affair. Now this was a tiny town in Connecticut where I grew up, 
and to this day I know my mother never had an affair with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But my father had this compelling insecurity that she was going to cheat on 
him. I frequently have that same feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Were there relationships that didn't have a violent component? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. but those were very short-lived. The women I pursue in relationships are 
the ones I have tumultuous feelings for. For a long time I confused love and 
passion with anger and violence and pain. I've stopped that now. I'm involved 
with somebody who won't tolerate any of that stuff. She's 27, an actress, and a 
very good person. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't seem to fit the stereotype of the man who batters. You're educated, 
soft-spoken, attractive, successful. You don't seem the kind of person who 
considers his woman to be his personal property. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd be surprised at who the batterers are. They are doctors, lawyers. The 
stereotype is wrong. My father was a pillar of the community. Successful, 
well-liked and attractive. He started the first Boy Scout troop and the first 
Little League team in our town. He taught Sunday school. He was well-respected. 
No one had any idea about the demons that lived in our house. 
</P>
<P>
 There were several times in my life when . . . One time in particular I recall 
vividly, I came close to being able to kill a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 She was an actress I'd been involved with for a year. It was a very violent 
relationship. She borrowed my car one night, told me she'd be back by midnight. 
She walked in at 4 a.m., without having called to tell me she'd be late. I was 
furious. I flipped out, went into a total rage. I yelled. She got in my face 
and yelled back. I started pushing her and holding her down and she just 
challenged me to go further and hit her. 
</P>
<P>
 I picked up a rock and I restrained her and I was on the verge of hitting her 
head with this big rock when I realized it might kill her. Her face was already 
very bruised because I'd hit her and I bit her. That was the end of that 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst relapse I'd had since starting therapy. I went regularly for 
three years, and when I felt I'd improved, I left the group. Now I only go when 
there's a problem. I had a very little relapse as recently as 14 months ago. 
But nothing as bad as that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Have you pinpointed a particular physical feeling or change that indicates 
you're about to lose control and become violent? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes . . . it starts here, in my solar plexus. (He places his palm at the 
center of his body, just below his chest). It's a tightening, a real physical 
feeling that totally takes over. Then I get a kind of warm, raging sensation in 
my head, near my temples. It's overwhelms me, like a chemical reaction. People 
who've seen it happen describe a change in my looks, in my eyes. I know it's 
true. . . . That's why I sometimes think it's not just behavior, but possibly a 
genetic thing. Or maybe it's a real chemical imbalance. But it's very specific 
and physical. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's physical, why were you so greatly helped by group therapy? 
</P>
<P>
 I learned to identify the sensations and feelings that forecast violence. And 
what steps to take so the violence never gets a grip. I have an agreement with 
my partner that when I feel the rage start, I'll leave for an hour. It's a 
pretty structured agreement, made in advance, so that she never feels I'm just 
slamming the door and abandoning her. She understands why I'm leaving, and that 
it's better for both of us. It's an excellent relationship, which I couldn't 
have had if it weren't for Alyce's group. 
</P>
<P>
 The group taught me that I could get better, that I could change over a period 
of time. And I have. I think it's really important that any man who abuses 
women should get into one of these groups for at least a year.

FIRST PERSON: 90S FAMILY; YOU JUST CAN'T ALTER DESTINY; IF FATE WANTS YOU TO BE 
THE GOOFBALL UNCLE, DO IT WITH STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am about to become The Goofball Uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 It came on unexpectedly. I'd always hoped that my destiny, my life's true 
persona, would be The Witty and Sophisticated Raconteur, or perhaps The Soulful 
Artiste or The Flinty Wordsmith or even The Great Lover. 
</P>
<P>
 I was not born weird. But some people have weirdness thrust upon them. So I am 
resigned never to be David Niven. The Goofball Uncle it is. 
</P>
<P>
 It bonked me like Newton's apple. Here is my kid brother, Brian, about to 
become a dad for the second time. His wife, Karen, is due any day now and his 
son -- my nephew Russell -- is about to be 3. Theirs is going to be a fine 
little family, in the tradition of Karen's siblings, of which there are about a 
thousand. Every one of them has gone the house-spouse-and-kids route and they 
are, each one, diligent, prudent and responsible. They go to PTA meetings and 
drive sensible cars. They are part of the firm backbone of our nation. 
</P>
<P>
 That would make me part of America's inflamed appendix. I am 41, unmarried, 
haven't had a real job in 10 years, am considered slightly less fiscally 
responsible than Princess Di, and I drive my Firebird as if high-octane premium 
gas were tap water. I eat cold pizza for breakfast, play golf when I should be 
writing my Nobel Prize-winning novel, consider dust a protective furniture 
coating, memorize the really bizarre parts of Hunter Thompson books, know -- 
and delight in telling -- a good-sized catalogue of sick jokes, do Peter Lorre 
on my answering machine tape every Halloween, play bad tenor saxophone and 
annoy the neighbors, and know how to call someone a horse's patoot in five 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
 I have not yet turned cranky, irascible, cynical and curmudgeonly, but I'm in 
the apprentice program. 
</P>
<P>
 So I figure I meet, and probably exceed, the requirements for designated 
Goofball Uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 Every family has one. He's the guy who gets seated at the kiddie table at 
Thanksgiving and cracks the brats up by belching the national anthem. He plays 
Santa at Christmas, but gets deep into the eggnog beforehand and blasts the 
kids halfway across the living room with a brandy-fueled HO! HO! HO! 
</P>
<P>
 If he takes his nephew to the ballgame, the child will come home woozy from 
unrestricted access to the concession stand and will spend the night urping on 
his mother. Unc will offer to atone by helping out around the house, but will 
be so incompetent at normal domestic chores that his sister-in-law will beg him 
to take the kids to a movie instead, and they will return frighteningly 
hyperactive and full of questions after downing eight Jolt colas during a 
screening of "Flesh-Eating Cheerleader Zombies From the Planet Maidenform." 
</P>
<P>
 All this stuff doesn't happen automatically, of course. For the past three 
years, while my nephew Russell has evolved from an uncomprehending bundle of 
yowling, pungent babyhood into a perceptive, inquisitive and highly malleable 
Dennis the Menace-in-training, I have played the role of the occasional visitor 
from afar who benignly plays ball and hands him over to Mom when he needs 
changing or just gets sick of looking at me. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, things are becoming different. With maturity come language 
skills, curiosity, and a greater need for mindless amusement, and springing in 
to fill that void will be me, the newly minted Goofball Uncle. Off I will fly, 
into the pristine mountains of Colorado, where Russell is enjoying beautiful 
natural surroundings, open spaces, friendly deer, clean air, kind neighbors and 
gentle nourishment in the bosom of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 I will arrive with a fistful of huge cigars, the latest grisly tales (and 
hideous jokes) from the O.J. Simpson case, a gift for Russell (something that 
makes an enormous amount of noise; 3-year-olds love that) and a Stephen King 
book to read to him at bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 I will take him to a Colorado Rockies game and when he asks me what all the 
spitting and scratching in the dugout is about, I'll tell him. I will teach him 
how to heckle the umpire and how to bet. I will encourage him to make lots of 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I will return him to his home and family, watching him ricochet around 
the place like an electron in a nuclear accelerator, and I will disappear for 
the evening. Next morning, as the family prepares for church, Russell will 
wonder where Uncle Pat went and who that ragged, gasping, staggering, 
scarlet-eyed wreck is who's gripping the dinette table with one hand and trying 
vainly to force down a bowlful of soggy Wheaties with the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's satisfying to know that all this is firmly fixed in my future, just 
waiting to spring to cockeyed life under the loving hand of me, the Goofball 
Uncle, a.k.a. The Lightning Rod, The Bad Case of Reality, The Low Tide in the 
Family Gene Pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't wait to see the new baby.

90S FAMILY; MOTHERLESS DAUGHTERS; THE GRIEF OF WOMEN WHOSE MOTHERS DIED 
PREMATURELY IS DEEP AND PROLONGED. BUT THERE IS SOLACE IN A SISTERHOOD OF 
COMMON EXPERIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, Special to The Times 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although her mother died 28 years ago of Hodgkin's disease, Gaile Price -- who 
was 9 at the time -- can't stop imagining her. 
</P>
<P>
 In her aunts' faces she sees her mother aged to the appropriate years. In 
exchanges between mothers and children, she hears her mother's voice. And 
through her father's recollections, she composes a mosaic of the woman who was 
to be her lifelong nurturer, teacher, adversary and role model to womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I have known about my mother is illness and death," said 
Price, 37. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt this loneliness, this hole inside of me . . . and that I was 
different because of her death," she said. "When my dad wrote about her (for 
me), it helped me tremendously. He really gave me my mother back." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Price, approximately one of every 20 children in America will lose a 
parent to death before age 15, according to J. William Worden, co-director of a 
Harvard University child bereavement study that tracks children for a decade 
after parental death. And the loss of a mother is rarer than the loss of a 
father, said Worden, who calculated that roughly two mothers die prematurely 
for every five fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the impact of mother loss upon a woman, whose primary identification 
and role-modeling is patterned after her mother, that is the subject of Hope 
Edelman's recently released book, "Motherless Daughters: A Legacy of Loss" 
(Addison-Wesley, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 The book is believed to be one of the first popular psychology books on the 
effects of early mother loss on women under 25. A New York Times review called 
it "an insightful first book . . . and . . . a moving and valuable treatment of 
a neglected subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who was 17 when her mother died of breast cancer, said: "I just set 
out to write a book that I had been looking for when my mother died. The grief 
books that I read weren't written for younger women who lost their mothers. 
They were written as if you mourned and it was over. That was like a blanket 
denial and part of what made me feel abnormal. . . . I found out that the 
grieving will never stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who is 27 and lives in New York, interviewed clinical psychologists, 
surveyed 154 motherless daughters by mail and interviewed 92 women in person. 
The result is a collection of anecdotal renderings that tell a story of denial, 
anger and yearning. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the book is not representative of the general population -- 89% of 
women interviewed were Caucasian and 69% attended college -- some common 
threads are explored. They include daughters' fear of dying at the same age as 
their mothers, feeling anxiety on the anniversary of death, fear of abandoning 
their children by death, feeling a void, and fear of future losses. The 
majority of women interviewed by Edelman called their mother's death the 
central defining event in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 After Edelman's book appeared, support groups formed spontaneously in Los 
Angeles, New York, Portland, Ore., Salt Lake City, St. Paul, Minn., and 
Atlanta, following Edelman's book readings. Lorraine Janeway, a counselor in 
the Portland area, said response was so overwhelming that she formed separate 
groups in various parts of the city.  
</P>
<P>
 And because motherless daughters feel alone in their experience, support 
groups are valuable for the solace of shared experience and the "mitigation of 
feelings of isolation," said Worden, a Newport Beach-based psychologist who 
wrote "Grief Counseling & Grief Therapy" (Springer Publishing Co. N.Y., 1982.) 
</P>
<P>
 The early loss of a mother can overwhelm some women for many years. A few 
women interviewed for this article said they felt so embarrassed and 
stigmatized by their mothers' deaths that they couldn't talk about it publicly. 
Others said they had postponed mourning for up to 20 years -- until the pain of 
not mourning overwhelmed them and bulldozed its way into their consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman writes that the daughter's age, the quality of the mother-daughter 
relationship, the way grieving is handled, the interdependence of siblings and 
what kind of mother substitute attachments are made afterward affect the impact 
of a mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Schlanger, 40, was 17 when her mother died in a car crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "She died at a bad time, right at the time when I hated my mother," said 
Schlanger, who teaches literature and composition at a community college in 
Santa Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 "The night she died, she came to my dorm and gave me a blanket with a note, 
saying 'Thought you might need this.' I don't think I have ever gotten over the 
guilt. I feel like I have spent my whole life just coping," she said. "I never 
got to apologize. I was convinced I wouldn't live past 38, her death age. So 
when I did . . . it was a milestone." 
</P>
<P>
 Worden said that guilt and fear of dying at the same age of a parent is fairly 
common among the motherless women in his practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a woman reaches close to the age that their mother died, there is a 
reactivation and a heightened awareness of one's mortality," he said. "There is 
some guilt about having survived longer than the parent, but it is a subtle . . 
. 'Why me, why did I survive?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And although Schlanger surpassed her mother's death age and experienced yet 
another critical loss when her father committed suicide years later, she 
endures a residual fear that she, too, could die, leaving her son abandoned 
like she was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that bad things happen," Schlanger said. "I've overcompensated 
by making sure that I am really involved with Thomas. I work part time, we read 
at night and we spend a lot of time together. If anything ever happened to me, 
he would know who I was." 
</P>
<P>
 In cases where girls do form healthy mother-substitute attachments, it is 
usually to an aunt, a grandmother or, less often, a stepmother. Still, Edelman 
and other experts said, many women say they are missing the kind of emotional 
security most daughters derive from their mothers but rarely from their 
fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a little girl, a mother makes everything OK," said Dorthea Lack, a San 
Francisco-based clinical psychologist who specializes in bereavement. "She 
stands between the child and the monsters of life. When the mother is gone, 
life can never be OK again. The father can be a dragon slayer, too, depending 
on how well he has handled his own grief and how present he is for his 
daughter. If your mother dies in your life, the primary nurturer, how can 
anything be permanent or safe?" 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Sabatini, 32, was 11 when her mother died of breast cancer, leaving her 
with a generalized feeling of insecurity and rootlessness. She felt doubly 
abandoned when her father shipped her off to relatives, remarried and avoided 
talk of his wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grieving has never gone away for me but you learn to cope with it," said 
Sabatini, who is a Venice-based film production coordinator. "Mortality is so 
real to me. Whenever I love someone, I think something bad is going to happen. 
I wait for people who are close to me to die. I always want to be prepared for 
it. Even when I hear someone is dying who I don't know, I get all choked up. It 
brings me right back." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such emotional fragility, Edelman said that most of the women she 
interviewed reported feeling self-reliant, strong and competent survivors as a 
result of their mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Linny Siefert, 29, who was 14 at the time of her mother's death from lymphoma, 
said she was pressed into service afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel emotionally the same way I did when I was 14," said Siefert, who now 
assists her father running his import fabric company. "I just lost my childhood 
and took on the responsibilities of a wife, going to the cleaners and grocery 
shopping while my friends did normal teen-age things. But those years were very 
un-nurturing and I felt like I never got what I deserved, which made me feel 
like I didn't deserve anything. I just had no guidance. A part of me died when 
she died." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it may never end, Edelman and psychologists say mourning changes as 
women grow older. With the help of therapists, support groups, family members 
and mementos, women get rid of the mythology surrounding the "idealized mother" 
and come to know the mother as she really was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grief is not a linear process; we got that idea from Freud," said Worden, the 
psychologist. "You keep your dead mother in your life through different kinds 
of memorialization as part of an ongoing negotiating process of, 'What would my 
relationship have been like now? Who would this person have been had they 
lived?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For different women such memorialization means different things. 
</P>
<P>
 For Schlanger, it has meant seeing her mother in her physical traits, 
temperament and in her own "good mothering" to her son. 
</P>
<P>
 For the non-religious Sabatini, it has meant honoring her mother, who was a 
devout Catholic, by attending a Catholic church on the anniversary of her death 
and on her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Price, who used to have a recurring dream in which her mother would 
come down from the heavens with only 15 minutes to visit, it has meant 
realizing that she doesn't have to "bargain with her mother for just a little 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 "That dream made me realize that all I wanted was a little something," said 
Price, the director of a private elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have so little of her. My mother died the day before Mother's Day and this 
was the first year I didn't just hide on Mother's Day by going to a double 
feature movie to avoid the mothers all over the place. This time I wore her 
watch with her name engraved on it. It felt wonderful and special. I felt 
really connected to her."

JIMMIE VAUGHAN: TUFF ENUFF -- AND THEN SOME; POP MUSIC: HIS PLAYING HAS NEVER 
BEEN MORE DIRECT THAN ON 'STRANGE PLEASURE,' HIS FIRST SOLO ALBUM AND HIS FIRST 
RECORDING SINCE THE DEATH OF BROTHER STEVIE RAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the talk one hears about music being the universal language, folks 
rarely get around to mentioning what's actually being said with it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interest of science, let's take an average rock guitar solo -- it 
scarcely matters which, just as long as it's one with zillions of screechy 
notes and dive-bomb effects -- and let's run it through the 
universal-translator device to see what really is being communicated: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, look at me! Me, me, me! Whooee, am I terrific or what? Hold on, here 
comes another thunderbolt from Olympus! Wow! I am one undisputed love monkey! 
Me, me, me! Look out, lawdy mama! . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's pretty much par for the course, though there are, thankfully, glorious 
exceptions, and Jimmie Vaughan is one. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two decades, since he emerged in 1975 as one of the Fabulous 
Thunderbirds, Vaughan's guitar solos have been akin to the terse, lean prose of 
a good detective writer, the kind that's steeped in cool but never masks honest 
emotion. And like all the best music, it defies literal translation, because it 
speaks with a directness that words can only echo. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan's playing has never been more direct than on the current "Strange 
Pleasure," the first solo album for the 43-year-old Dallas native and his first 
work since the 1990 "Family Style" album with his younger brother, Stevie Ray 
Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the recording of "Family Style" and its release, Stevie Ray was killed 
in a helicopter crash, after a concert with his brother and Eric Clapton at 
Alpine Valley, Wis. It was a bitter loss, even for those who knew the man only 
through his music; for Jimmie and the rest of the family, it had to be a 
tragedy beyond words. It infuses "Strange Pleasure," but not in any expected 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 One hardly could imagine a less blue blues album. Instead of wallowing, it 
addresses the joys of life -- with everything from T-Birds-like party grooves 
to celebratory '50s-style R & B to gospel affirmations, and a conviction fired 
by having faced the grimmer alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone from a tour stop in Texas last week, Vaughan -- who will be at 
the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on Thursday -- said it took him a long 
time to arrive at the point he's at now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally realized I had a choice: I could either dwell on all this and feel 
bad about it or I could try to feel good and change things. I went through some 
things and I came out the other end, and everything is going to be OK, and I 
didn't know that for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do feel good about being alive and playing music. I have a good life. It 
has to do with what glasses I have on, you know what I mean? You can feel bad 
or feel good, and I choose to feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the album's song about Stevie's death, "Six Strings Down," has a positive 
outlook, speculating on the blues jams going on in heaven. The song came to 
Jimmie from the Neville Brothers, and he added a verse of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd run into the Nevilles at a lot of shows over the years," Vaughan said. 
"I guess since we were brothers, we had that sort of unspoken family thing 
there. Art Neville and his brothers wrote the song very soon after Stevie's 
accident and sent it to me, and I just sort of put it up. I couldn't listen to 
it at first, though them doing it really touched me. When I finally heard it, 
Art Neville had said what I really wanted to say and couldn't seem to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 For the album (produced by Nile Rodgers) and his current tour, Vaughan 
enlisted some veteran groove-masters for a distinctive musical lineup: 
guitarist/keyboard player Denny Freeman, drummer George Rains, organist Bill 
Willis (who also provides the bass line) and backup singers Reginald Brisbon, 
Dennis King and Calvin Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasized by what Vaughan calls the "sanctified" organ sound and the vocal 
chorus, a spiritual thread runs through several of the songs on the record. The 
vocally driven "Two Wings" and the swampy "Love the World" -- both co-written 
by Vaughan and Mac (Dr. John) Rebennack -- sound straight out of the black 
gospel tradition. Meanwhile, on the moving soul ballad "(Everybody's Got) Sweet 
Soul Vibe," Vaughan sings: 
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 Did you ever feel the peace, ever love the fear,  
</P>
<P>
 Ever hear the truth that rings crystal clear?  
</P>
<P>
 There's a place to go, where we know  
</P>
<P>
 That a river of love always flows.  
</P>
<P>
 Sweet soul vibe.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 While his brother's music sounded at times as if it were trying to reach 
people's hearts by burning through brick walls, Vaughan's isn't quite so 
declamatory. A self-contained serenity invites the listener in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to get anything across to people," he said. "I'm just saying 
what I have felt. I'm not trying to get anybody else to do anything. I just 
sing and play what I know about, and I only know about what's happened to me 
and how I feel. Every time I've ever played, it's been that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only play what I know and only write what I know about. It's a completely 
selfish thing. When somebody you're close to you gets killed like that, 
everything changes. I'm enjoying myself now, and I think the music speaks for 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 After his brother's death, Vaughan all but disappeared, rarely turning up in 
public even to listen to music. Instead, he busied himself with his family and 
with handling his brother's estate. It was described in the press as a 
"self-imposed exile," but he didn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I was enjoying myself. I was with my wife and my kids and I was 
having a good time being a normal guy; I hadn't been at home steady for 15 
years. I think I've learned how to have a better balance, not to let the 
business rule my life. My main important thing in life now is to be happy and 
to be there for people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never stopped playing guitar. I've been playing every day since I was 12. I 
just didn't want to be out in public, because everyone wanted to tell me how 
sorry they were, and that got old, even though they all meant well." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Clapton who got him performing again, first as a guest at a couple of 
Clapton's own shows and then as the opening act for some of his concerts last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I had played those (initial) gigs with him, Clapton called and said, 
'Would you open some shows for me?' and the guitar player in me came out and 
said, 'Sure, I'd love to.' Then after I hung up I realized I didn't have a band 
or anything! He gave me the kick in the pants I needed to get going again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came at the right time. I just had to wait for the right feelings. It 
needed to be for the right reason, which was that I had to do it because it 
felt right." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Thunderbirds, Vaughan typically would stand to the side, shaping the 
music with this rhythm guitar and spinning leads in response to front man Kim 
Wilson's verses. Is it difficult now being center stage, in the spotlight? 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, it doesn't really feel different," Vaughan said. "It just feels 
more . More fulfilling." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he said it wouldn't bother him at all if critics would finally stop 
singling out the "economy" of his playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought that was a whole lot of (nonsense). It was like one guy 
wrote that in the beginning, trying to say something complimentary about me, 
and everyone since then has repeated it. All I'm doing is playing exactly what 
I feel. I play a lot like Freddie King, and I've never heard anybody talk about 
Freddie King's economy and all that, just because he didn't play all over the 
place as fast as he could. They don't say that about B.B. King. I'm not 
thinking about economy. I'm just trying to play what I'd want to hear, and 
that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the accident, Jimmie and Stevie Ray had been planning to tour together. 
Now that he's on his own, does he wonder whether audiences are expecting him to 
fill two pairs of shoes? 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't felt that at all," he said. "I really feel like, at all the shows 
I've done, people have been genuinely glad to see me and had a great time. I've 
missed playing onstage, and I think it shows. We don't have time to think about 
all that. You know how when you go out onstage, you don't really know what 
happens until it's over? That's the way it feels. We come out and have a 
party." 
</P>

HE HEARS THE SOUND OF REVOLUTION -- AND LIKES IT; LATIN JAZZ: BOBBY MATOS 
THINKS 'THE WHOLE AFRO-CUBAN SCENE IS EXPLODING.' HE PERFORMS IN LONG BEACH 
THIS EVENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Percussionist Bobby Matos, who will lead his 10-piece Heritage Ensemble at the 
Long Beach Museum of Art tonight, sees more than a resurgence in Latin jazz. He 
sees a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 A native New Yorker who learned his craft as a youngster, following revered 
conga player Patato Valdez from gig to gig around the city, he thinks "the 
whole Afro-Cuban scene is exploding. It's a whole movement that people are 
becoming aware of" in the wake of the film "The Mambo Kings." 
</P>
<P>
 "Inside that resurgent interest in traditional Latin jazz are some very 
revolutionary aspects," Matos said on the phone from his home in L.A.'s 
Silverlake area, "aspects that are now seeping into the music of the more 
traditional players, like Tito Puente and Poncho Sanchez." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't putting down those giants of Latin music. On the contrary, as 
someone who has developed from the same tradition, he said he has nothing but 
respect for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I play, someone always comes up and says 'Wow, you sound just like Tito 
Puente or Mongo Santamaria,' and that's a great compliment. That's the kind of 
stuff we grew up with, the Tito Puentes and Machitos and the Mario Bauzas. They 
represent the best of that style, like Poncho today." 
</P>
<P>
 Matos doesn't have much patience, though, with the pop-oriented side of the 
music. "Today's commercial salsa bands -- they're like the sound of fingernails 
on a blackboard to me. They're all arranged around the vocalist, and it's more 
important that the vocalist have a nice haircut and clothes, and that he's 
cute, than that he sings in tune or knows what he's doing. They're selling 
image and trying to create pop stars. They're making pop arrangements out of 
salsa rhythms and not playing with feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the antithesis of what great Afro-Cuban music can be. Great Afro-Cuban 
dance music always borrowed from jazz. Machito, Mario Bauza, Eddie Palmieri, 
people who were geniuses of the dance field, they were always playing 
Afro-Cuban jazz. And it was full of feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, 53-year-old Matos -- who grew up listening to Billie Holiday, the 
Modern Jazz Quartet and Dizzy Gillespie as well as Machito, Puente and Cal 
Tjader -- maintains things are swinging back to the creative, as opposed to the 
commercial, side of the ledger. He sees Afro-Caribbean musicians searching out 
new forms to incorporate with their tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's another thing happening now, the awareness of what Miles Davis was 
doing at one point during the period after John Coltrane was in the band, the 
period of Wayne Shorter and (Davis' 1967 recording) 'Nefertiti.' Not so much 
the electronic stuff, but the modal period when Miles was asking, 'What can we 
do beyond the contemporary be-bop chords?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Matos pointed to a new generation that includes saxophonist David Sanchez, 
pianist Danilo Perez, trumpeter-percussionist Jerry Gonzales (who leads the 
Fort Apache Band) and his bassist-brother Andy Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 "These cats are all about trying to find a new way to express the music so 
that we can grow and go on to the next step. That's very important. Otherwise, 
we're just copying what we've heard before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He is especially high on Sanchez. "He's only in his 20s and he's just where 
Sonny Rollins once was. Like Sonny, he's overturning the concepts of what 
people think a saxophone solo should be, giving you something revolutionary to 
hear." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of forward thinking is reflected on Matos' own latest album 
"Collage: Afro-Cuban Jazz" on the Night Life label. Utilizing the new 
developments in the music is, he said, "like being awakened into a whole new 
world, like being a painter who has been given a whole new palette to work 
with. Especially in live performances, we're trying to show a wider 
kaleidoscope of colors, a wider range of intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight in Long Beach, his new wrinkles will include percussionist-actor 
Ismael East Carb reading poetry by Langston Hughes and the late Cuban poet 
Nicholas Tuillen while the Heritage Ensemble provides background. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working on a project combining poetry and music for the last two 
years on a (Los Angeles) Cultural Affairs grant," Matos said. "I always felt 
that poetry was made to be presented to music, not in a hip-hop style but with 
actors in a more dramatic, more cinematic way. This will be just a sample." 
</P>
<P>
 Matos also has spent the last two years in a variety of educational programs 
for children and teen-agers, working with teens at Los Angeles' Plaza de la 
Raza Cultural Center and participating in programs sponsored by the California 
Arts Council and the L.A. Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Such work, he said, not only has its own rewards but goes a long way toward 
developing understanding between ethnic groups. "Most of the kids have no idea 
how the music relates to their culture. After they learn the roots of 
Afro-Caribbean music, they tell us they hadn't realized that the black culture 
and the Latin culture had anything in common. I think that's amazing." 
</P>
<P>

Museum of Art, 2300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach. $10 for non-members, $8 for

LEGAL EXPERT URGES VENUE CHANGE IN THORNTON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Testifying for the second day, a defense legal expert urged a Superior Court 
judge to move the high-profile murder trial of Thousand Oaks teen-ager Mark 
Scott Thornton out of Ventura County because of the local publicity that has 
surrounded the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward J. Bronson, a professor of political science and law at Cal State 
Chico, said during Thornton's change-of-venue hearing that too many potential 
jurors in the county have already decided that Thornton killed Westlake nurse 
Kellie O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is at least a reasonable likelihood that Mr. Thornton will not be able 
to receive a fair trial in Ventura County," Bronson said, providing for the 
first time a conclusion to a survey he conducted on publicity in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 If Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath decides against the motion to move 
the trial, Bronson suggested several alternatives that he said would offer the 
19-year-old Thornton a better chance at getting a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge could grant attorneys in the case additional peremptory challenges 
to disqualify more jurors who appear prejudiced against the defendant, Bronson 
recommended. Or the judge could delay the start of the September trial until 
memory of the case fades from the public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But any of those alternative solutions, he said, were secondary to moving the 
trial to another county. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these things are useful," Bronson said. "They can ameliorate some of the 
prejudices. But they cannot cure them." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton is charged with kidnaping and fatally shooting O'Sullivan, 34, the 
mother of a young son. A grand jury indictment in the case includes a "special 
circumstance" that could send Thornton to the gas chamber, if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronson testified on Monday that a survey he designed to gauge public 
awareness and possible prejudice of the case also supported moving the trial 
out of the county. Eighty-five percent of the 403 respondents knew about the 
case, and two-thirds of those with knowledge of it believe Thornton is guilty, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said media coverage of the case had been fairly accurate, but that news 
reports tended to portray Thornton in a negative light and O'Sullivan in a 
sympathetic way. 
</P>
<P>
 Under direct examination by Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher on Tuesday, 
Bronson said the case should be moved from the county for the same reasons that 
the district attorney's office decided to seek the death penalty in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, he said, the crime of which Thornton is accused -- a single 
slaying with no allegation of rape or torture -- does not merit the death 
penalty or a change of venue. 
</P>
<P>
 But, because O'Sullivan was white, middle-class and a mother, the tragedy of 
her death resonated with the community more than other killings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a terrible, sadistic, multiple murder-type killing," Bronson 
said. He added that the uniqueness of the case is the fear and loathing it left 
in the community during a 12-day search for O'Sullivan's body after she was 
discovered missing Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Bronson acknowledged that he is personally opposed to 
the death penalty, sends $50 a year to the American Civil Liberties Union and 
favors more rights for criminal defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I teach civil liberties," he told Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris, "and 
I am deeply committed to civil liberties." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he has testified in 56 change-of-venue hearings, mostly to have 
trials moved out of the counties where crimes occurred. He also acknowledged 
that in some of those instances defendants have wound up being found not 
guilty, even after he testified that their chances of getting a fair trial were 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, which is expected to last until next Wednesday, will continue 
today with Bronson back on the stand for more cross-examination.

KADOTA FIG PROJECT CLEARS LAST HURDLE; DEVELOPMENT: SIMI VALLEY COUNCIL'S 
DECISION TO PAY $41,000 FOR CURBS, GUTTERS AND SIDEWALKS PAVES WAY FOR 22 HOMES 
FOR NEEDY FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A long-awaited Simi Valley project that would house 22 needy families in the 
city's Kadota Fig neighborhood has cleared its last major hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council agreed late Monday to pay up to $41,000 for 
curbs, gutters and sidewalks near the Apricot Ranch project after a spokesman 
for the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. said construction could be stalled 
indefinitely if the developer was required to pay for the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Lippman, Cabrillo's project manager, said construction costs would eat 
up most of the project's $2.1 million in government grants and loans, leaving 
little for improvements to nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extremely tight project," Lippman told the council. "The money is 
just not there to build these off-site improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 In Kadota Fig, an east city neighborhood split by the Simi Valley Freeway, 
gutters and curbs are intentionally rare. Longtime residents requested that the 
city not make such improvements more than a decade ago, so that the 
neighborhood could retain its rural character. 
</P>
<P>
 But a city study found that gutters and sidewalks are necessary for Apricot 
Ranch because the project would increase the risk of flooding and pedestrian 
and auto traffic along the quiet, residential street. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the required changes are not part of the project and because the 
houses are priced for low-income residents, the council unanimously decided the 
city should foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a very good project here and I don't want to get hung up on $41,000 
in curbs and gutters," Mayor Greg Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Barbara Williamson agreed: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a limit to what you can expect from a developer," she said. 
"I think it's unfair to make the builder put that in, especially when they are 
trying to bring in some housing for the needy." 
</P>
<P>
 The project is designed for families who earn less than 75% of the county 
median income, so a family of four earning no more than $39,900 would qualify. 
The houses are expected to be sold for $135,000 to $140,000. The average price 
of a house in Simi Valley is about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city in 1992 agreed to lend Cabrillo about $680,000 to buy the 1.6-acre 
project site. Cabrillo had hoped to have the houses built by May, 1993, but 
delays in funding and planning stalled the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo, the county's largest builder of housing for the poor, has built 
dwellings for low-income families in Ojai, Santa Paula, Ventura, Camarillo, 
Oxnard and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Lippman said he expects to break ground in September and have the houses 
completed by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 Apricot Ranch structures are made up of 22 three-bedroom duplex unit 
with fenced patios, yards and two-car garages. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Mikels said she is pleased that the project is finally being 
built. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're all really happy to see this happening," Mikels said. "I think 
it's a project we'll all be proud of."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COMPUTER LABS ENRICH DAYS AT SUMMER 
SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Danny Varola is jamming down the information superhighway, and 
acutely aware of his destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computer technology is a significant thing in the future," he said, taking a 
break from his classroom keyboard. "It's a good thing to learn now." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the premise on which Santa Susana Elementary School has based its 
summer school program this year, which for the first time is using technology 
as an integral tool in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their regular course work, the 400 elementary school children 
enrolled in Simi Valley summer school work in one of two computer labs for 30 
minutes each day. 
</P>
<P>
 During the regular school year, the students spend only about a half an hour a 
week in the computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
 The students also use video equipment in the classroom to record student 
projects and listen to books on tape at classroom listening centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley educators created the unique summer curriculum after noticing that 
technology captured the students' interest and seemed to inspire them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology goes hand-in-hand with the curriculum in the classroom," 
summer school Principal Judy Cannings said. "The thought was that students seem 
to want to do more (work) when they're using the technology." 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth- and sixth-grade students in Danny's class this week agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a funner way to learn," said Jacqui Gari, 10. "It's better than sitting 
in a chair and listening to a teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqui's summer school teacher Martha Dickerson said using computers and other 
technological devices allows the students to see their failures and successes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children are actively engaged," she said. "This type of tool can be 
tailor-made to a child's needs." 
</P>
<P>
 In the computer lab each day, the students practice typing, reading 
comprehension or math exercises. This week, Dickerson plans to have her 
students type essays that they recently wrote into the computers and edit them. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, she said, using the technology helps to boost students' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more you practice something, the better you get," she said. "And the 
better you get, the more you like it." TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ADEQUATE MILITARY COMPENSATION URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) introduced a measure Tuesday to create a 
national commission to figure out how to prevent U.S. military personnel and 
their dependents from needing food stamps or other government assistance 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission would determine the extent to which military families are 
relying on government aid to remain above the poverty line and to find ways to 
ensure that their compensation would make such assistance unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 17,000 members of the military and their families depend on food 
stamps and other federal assistance programs to survive, according to the 
Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, $63,509 in food stamps was redeemed in the Port Hueneme 
Seabee base commissary last year, a 27% increase from 1992. More than $5,700 in 
food stamps was turned in at Point Mugu last year. And vouchers worth $32,000 
were redeemed through the aid to women with infant children program at the two 
bases combined. ALAN C. MILLER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS PLAZA TOPS $5 
MILLION

 The endowment to cover day-to-day operational costs at the Civic Arts Plaza 
has topped $5 million, fund-raisers said Tuesday, after announcing six new 
pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading this week's giving, the Calabasas-based Xircom Inc. pledged 
$150,000.Xircom, which develops networking systems for personal computers, will 
move its corporate headquarters and 235 employees to Thousand Oaks this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Xircom's gift includes $100,000 from the company itself and $50,000 from the 
firm's 32-year-old president, Dirk Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Another high-tech firm, Litton Industries, has joined the roster of major 
donors by contributing $100,000 to the Civic Arts Plaza. The aerospace company 
is based in Beverly Hills, but has offices in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other donors have agreed to kick in $50,000 apiece: Pruner Health 
Services, which operates ambulances throughout the county; P.L. Porter & Co. of 
Woodland Hills, which manufactures devices that move chairs into reclining 
positions; R.C. Dudek & Co. Inc. of Oxnard, which distributes fasteners and 
other hardware, and Westlake Village residents Sheldon and Susan Malchicoff. 
</P>
<P>
 With the six pledges, fund-raisers reached the half-way mark of their 
endowment drive. Originally, they planned for a $3-million endowment, but have 
now decided to collect $10 million to subsidize programming and operating costs 
in the Civic Arts Plaza theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you reset your goal up so high, you do sometimes have doubts," campaign 
director Richard T. Johnson said. "To suddenly hit the half-way mark (means) 
it's doable. We're moving right along." STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCILWOMAN WEBB WILL SEEK REELECTION 
</P>

<P>
 Reiterating her anti-crime, pro-business platform, Simi Valley Councilwoman 
Sandi Webb on Tuesday announced her plans to run for reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 If reelected, Webb, 46, said one of her main goals will be to shepherd a 
planned new police station through to completion without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very important goal for me for the last two years is to get the police 
station started and on-line," Webb said. "I think it's important that we do it 
without increasing the tax burden on residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb is the only Libertarian to hold elected office in Ventura County. She is 
completing her first term on the council, a nonpartisan body. 
</P>
<P>
 A political unknown when she first decided to run for a council seat in 1990, 
Webb ran an aggressive campaign and ended up the top vote-getter in a field of 
nine candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent more than $20,000 and was the first council candidate in city 
history to buy cable television ads. 
</P>
<P>
 The council seat held by Judy Mikels is also up for grabs in November. Mikels 
has given up a shot at reelection to run for county supervisor. She faces 
Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery in the November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other Simi Valley residents have announced plans to run for City Council 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Douglas K. Dubin, 27, a self-employed housewares distributor; Dean F. 
Kunicki, 49, an insurance consultant and Simi Valley planning commissioner; 
Michael S. Mc Caffrey, an insurance underwriter and former president of the 
Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce; Lindsey Paul Miller, 55, former Simi Valley 
police chief, and Joseph R. Vesalga, 39, a computer operator and neighborhood 
council director. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; ARTS PLAZA MAY HOST BROADWAY MUSICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The longest-running musical in Broadway history, "A Chorus Line," could hit 
the Thousand Oaks stage in January if theater commissioners tonight approve a 
contract with Phoenix, Ariz.-based Theater League. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed contract calls for Theater League to produce three musicals in 
Civic Arts Plaza's inaugural season: "A Chorus Line" in January, "Annie" in 
April, and "42nd Street" in May. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Theater League sells at least half the seats for each show, the 
group will also have the right to produce Broadway musicals in the 1995-96 
season, or to bring in touring shows such as "Cats" and "Les Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
 To rent the 1,800-seat auditorium, Theater League will pay $1 per subscriber 
for each week of performances or rehearsals. The minimum weekly rent has been 
set at $5,000, theater director Tom Mitze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater League's three song-and-dance extravaganzas will replace the six 
Broadway shows originally slated to be produced by Pasadena-based Theater Corp. 
of America. That group withdrew from the Civic Arts Plaza earlier this year, 
citing financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Theater Corp. of America's abrupt departure left a gaping hole in the 
Civic Arts Plaza's programming schedule, Mitze said dozens of groups have 
appeared to fill the slots. And he predicted that Theater League's shows will 
pack the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're going to be Thousand Oaks' cup of tea," Mitze said. "They're 
bringing in the most successful, most popular musicals in Broadway history. 
Shows everyone has heard of." Tickets will cost $15 to $30 for subscribers who 
intend to see all three shows. Other prices will vary depending on the date and 
time of performance and the location of seats. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER RAISING MOTEL TAX 
2% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to boost city coffers, the Simi Valley City Council has agreed to 
consider increasing the nightly tax charged on rooms at hotels and motels from 
8% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel and motel patrons who stay in Simi Valley now pay an 8% transient 
occupancy tax on top of the cost of a room.The increase would boost the tax to 
the rate now charged in Thousand Oaks, Ventura and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 At the current tax rate, Simi Valley takes in about $450,000 a year, which 
goes into the city's general fund, said John McMillan, director of general 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the increase would add $100,000 to the annual tax revenue, 
McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandi Webb said she objects to the increase because it would 
place an unfair burden on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this tax is unfair in the first place," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increasing it is just going to make it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the proposed tax increase will be held at the council's 
Aug. 22 meeting. SARA CATANIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SHELTER SEIZES 2 HORSES USED IN CITY 
CLASSES

<P>
 Two horses used in riding classes sponsored by the city of Ventura were seized 
by county officials Tuesday after a county veterinarian determined the horses 
were starving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horses were emaciated," said Jolene Hoffman, animal shelter director for 
the Humane Society of Ventura County. "When we found them they were so hungry 
they were eating manure." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Ventura Recreation and Parks Department said they were 
alarmed to learn that horses used in the city's class were being mistreated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea that there was a problem," said Judy Devine, the city's 
recreation coordinator. "We would never want to be involved with something 
where horses are being harmed." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials canceled the riding class Tuesday, offering a full refund to 
the students. About 20 children were enrolled in the once-a-week class that 
began this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Devine said Somis resident Renae Ferguson is the owner of the horses. 
Ferguson, who could not be reached for comment, called the city offering to 
teach a class earlier this year, Devine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something we hadn't offered in a while, and after we interviewed her 
we thought it would be a good program," Devine said.  
</P>
<P>
 On July 12, the Humane Society received a complaint that two of eight horses 
at Ferguson's Somis stables were starving, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hoffman, Ferguson insisted the horses appeared lean because they 
were old, not because they were being mistreated. "She told us she didn't think 
they looked bad," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after three visits to the horses' Somis stable, Humane Society officials 
brought a veterinarian to examine the horses and two horses were taken to the 
Humane Society's shelter in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining horses, Hoffman said that two more were "very lean" and would 
be monitored. The others were healthy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman said the mistreatment of the animals was not a unique case. The Humane 
Society has seized 22 horses under similar circumstances this year. MATTHEW

2 TEEN-AGERS ROB DOUGHNUT SHOP

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-agers robbed a doughnut shop in Camarillo early Tuesday morning, with 
one of them holding up the only employee on duty with what appeared to be a 
handgun hidden under his shirt, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves took $38 and a dozen doughnuts from Winchell's Donut Shop at 455 
Carmen Drive, said Dina Flick, a manager at the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12:25 a.m., the robbers, believed to be between 16 and 18 years old, 
entered the store and asked to see some doughnuts, authorities said. Suddenly, 
one robber leaped over the counter, reached under his shirt and pointed at the 
store employee, as if holding a gun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both suspects were described as white males with medium builds, police said. 
One was wearing a black bandanna on his head, a dark-colored shirt and baggy 
pants. The other had blond hair, blue eyes, was wearing a white long-sleeve 
shirt and baggy pants. JASON GRANT

METAL DETECTORS FOR SCHOOLS PROPOSED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to an increase in knives on junior high school campuses, Oxnard 
School District trustees are expected to discuss this evening the possibility 
of disarming students by using metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, the number of students bringing knives to schools increased 
from five to 23, Supt.Bernard Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13,000-student district has two junior high schools and 13 elementary 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members and district administrators are scheduled to address the legal 
and financial ramifications of using detectors and to discuss their 
effectiveness, Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to present to the board what options are available," Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most children who have brought knives to school have just shown them 
off, two older students have threatened classmates, Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students who brought knives to school were 13 or 14 years old, Korenstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein said the district has sent parents letters advising them of state 
laws prohibiting weapons on campus. CHRISTINA LIMA

OXNARD DEAL OKD DESPITE DISCOVERY OF DDT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday approved a $5.3-million deal to purchase 41 
acres of land for a school and park despite the recent discovery of DDT and 
other agricultural pesticides on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal had been the subject of a bitter dispute for two years, marred by 
claims of back-room City Council filibusters and improper requests by 
Councilman Michael Plisky of the property's owner, Donald T. Kojima. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad it's over," Kojima said after the sale was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials were unaware of the contamination on the Kojima property 
until last week, when inspectors for the Rio School District discovered DDT and 
residue from other farming chemicals on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding did not delay the deal any further, however, because the extent of 
contamination is below state regulatory limits, City Atty. Gary Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract of sale, which was amended after the contamination was found, 
requires Kojima to pay for any possible cleanup, Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the deal has been approved, its original purpose -- to relocate the 
residents of one of the county's worst slums, an Oxnard trailer park -- is now 
in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported last month that low-cost housing the city was talking about 
building would have been too expensive for the park's poor residents to afford. 
City Council members have since vowed to do all they can to cut the price of 
the homes. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

OXNARD PAIR KILLED IN COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard couple were killed early Tuesday in Tarzana when a suspected drunk 
driver hit their car head-on, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Hawkins, 45, and his wife, Mary Hawkins, 42, were pronounced dead on 
arrival at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and Encino-Tarzana Regional 
Medical Center, respectively, Los Angeles Police Officer Steve Schiltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Van Nuys resident Ramon Gonzalez, 46, was driving drunk when he 
plowed into the Hawkins' car. Gonzalez was later booked on two counts of 
vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision occurred when Gonzalez ran a red light at Topham Street and 
Tampa Avenue in Tarzana around 12:40 a.m. and barreled into a Geo Metro on the 
opposite side of Topham, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The compact car was propelled more than 100 feet before Gonzalez's car turned 
and ran into a utility pole, Schiltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Hawkins was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident but it was 
uncertain whether his wife was wearing one, Valley Traffic Detective Jim Mann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiltz said two witnesses first noticed Gonzalez driving "crazily" on Balboa 
Boulevard. They told officers that before the collision at Tampa, Gonzalez's 
Chevrolet Caprice sideswiped one car and collided with another on Balboa before 
speeding off toward Tampa. The witnesses then followed Gonzalez as he sped 
through intersections, often on the wrong side of the road, Schiltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the compact car was hit, Schiltz reported witnesses as saying that 
Gonzalez's sedan was traveling between 65 and 80 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "He reeked of the smell of alcoholic beverages," Schiltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez was being held in the jail ward at County-USC Medical Center in fair 
condition, police said. ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY NEGOTIATING FOR HISTORIC GROCERY SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura will enter negotiations with a downtown Ventura developer who plans to 
raze all but two walls of the historic Peirano Grocery building on Main Street, 
the City Council decided Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wood, president of Ventura Realty, and his father, Jack Wood, will 
negotiate with the city on the firm's proposal to buy the city's oldest 
building and develop the surrounding land. 
</P>
<P>
 The project seemed to be in jeopardy earlier this summer when Ventura Realty, 
the original funding source, backed out of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But company President Tom Wood promised the council Monday that he would find 
other financiers for the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood hopes to knock down all but two walls of the old grocery, which is now 
owned by the city. That would expose a Spanish lavanderia underneath, which he 
intends to restore and surround with a courtyard of restaurants, shops and 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Peirano's Market operated on Main Street from 1877 to 1987, when the city 
bought it from the Peirano family with the intention of preserving it as a 
historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The lavanderia, a 26-by-30-foot tile-lined pool, may have served as the 
laundry for San Buenaventura Mission, which is across the street from the 
Peirano building. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry residents with sentimental attachments to the grocery jammed the council 
chambers in March when the council made the initial decision to negotiate with 
Wood and Ventura Realty, the largest property owner in downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 For months after the rancorous March meetings, Ventura city officials tried to 
open a negotiating agreement with Ventura Realty, but the company's 
shareholders balked at taking on such a controversial project. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a handful of incensed residents returned to City Hall to plead 
their case again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peirano's building was a grocery store and many lives were attached to it 
over many years," said Ventura resident Jo Rogers. "It may not be of major 
historical significance, but it is our history." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the price tag running at $430,000 just to bring Ventura's oldest 
brick building up to seismic standards, many council members say they are not 
averse to tearing the structure down. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; UFW WINS RECOUNT OF WORKERS' BALLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Laborers at an Oxnard produce company voted 298 to 278 to join the United Farm 
Workers union last May, state labor officials found Monday after a recount of 
contested ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of Ocean View Produce, a subsidiary of Dole Food Co., 
refused to recognize the new results, contending that the election was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's very specific rules on how elections are to be conducted, and 
questions have been raised on both sides," said Tom Pernice, a Dole spokesman. 
"The vote was very close, and there are an equal number of voters who did not 
want union representation." 
</P>
<P>
 The original results of the May 18 election showed that workers had voted 275 
to 231 to join the union, but Ocean View Produce Co. officials challenged 87 
additional ballots, arguing the people -- mostly farm labor contractors -- had 
no right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Agricultural Labor Relations Board reviewed the contested ballots 
and decided that 70 should be considered valid votes. Yet Ocean View Produce 
has questioned how the labor relations board arrived at that figure and refuses 
to recognize UFW as its employees union. 
</P>
<P>
 UFW officials did not return phone calls Tuesday. The election was the UFW's 
first in Ventura County in about four years. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; ARTIST WOOD, 101, TO LEAVE HOSPITAL SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Renowned ceramist Beatrice Wood is recovering from surgery at a Los Angeles 
hospital and is expected to return to her Ojai retreat sometime this week, her 
manager said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, 101, entered the hospital three weeks ago when she contracted 
bronchitis, which deteriorated into pneumonia, said Ram Singh, Wood's manager 
and personal assistant for the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Once her pneumonia had improved, doctors discovered a bleeding ulcer and kept 
her in the hospital for surgery, Singh said. He requested that the name of the 
hospital be kept private so that the famed artist can rest with no disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 She is expected to return to her Ojai studio this week, probably by Friday, 
Singh said. Wood will continue her recovery there for about a month before 
returning to work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is doing quite well," Singh said. "She's a tough lady. The doctors 
couldn't believe she's 101 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood's clay pieces have been acclaimed in the international art world for 
their whimsy and craft. Her ceramics are displayed in the permanent collections 
of 12 major U.S. museums, including the Smithsonian and New York's Metropolitan 
Museum, as well as at museums around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Her pieces range from lusterware goblets and fiery glazed dishes to funny, 
folk-artsy figures. One piece called "Modern Woman," created in 1991, depicts a 
female hoisting a male over her head. She also has created miniature bordellos 
out of clay. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she fell ill, Wood was creating up to a dozen new pieces each month, 
Singh said. She can't wait to get back to her studio and start creating more, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She keeps telling the doctors: 'Let me go home. I have so many ideas in my 
head that I need to turn into clay and stone,' " Singh said. KAY SAILLANT

JUDGE ORDERS CENTURY 21 AD CHANGE; REAL ESTATE: AS THE RESULT OF A COMPETITOR'S 
COMPLAINT, THE O.C.-BASED COMPANY MUST BACK OFF ITS CLAIM OF SELLING A HOME 
EVERY MINUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looks like it's time for Century 21 to get a new watch. A federal judge ruled 
this week that the national real estate franchise chain does not "sell a home 
every minute of the day," as some of the company's advertising says. Instead, 
the boldest claim that the Irvine-based real estate franchise company can make 
is that it "helps sell a home on average every minute" of the day, said U.S. 
District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler, who granted a preliminary injunction last 
month to stop the Century 21 ads. 
</P>
<P>
 A complaint about the ads was filed by a major Century 21 competitor, 
Denver-based Re/Max International Inc., in the latest volley in a bitter battle 
between the two real estate giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Century 21 and Re/Max have sued each other over which is entitled to bill 
itself as the nation's largest real estate franchise and whether Century 21 is 
rated No. 1 by homeowners, as it claims to be. The trial in at least one of the 
cases is expected to begin in Santa Ana early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just trying to damage us. It's sleaze," said Dick Loughlin, president 
of Century 21. "It's Round One of a major lawsuit that will be coming to trial 
early next year that will be very interesting for the entire real estate 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Loughlin said Century 21, a subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 
will continue to run the "once a minute" advertisements but will alter the 
wording. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 18, Century 21 was cited for contempt of court for not obeying an 
injunction barring the ads. Loughlin said his company was waiting for the judge 
to clarify the court order. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the delay, Century 21 must pay Re/Max's legal fees, estimated 
at $50,000, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Liniger, chairman of Re/Max International, said he too is looking forward 
to the court battle and hopes the case will show the need for stronger 
advertising standards in the real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's court action "is a minor skirmish in a complex case that will 
continue for quite some time," he said. "We're pushing for the first possible 
trial date anyone will give us. We don't think Century 21 is rated No. 1 by 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 The advertisements, many of which feature a watch, were run by the Pacific 
Division of Century 21. That operation includes about 100 franchises, most of 
them in Orange County. The ads appeared only in the Orange County and San Diego 
business journals during 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 One ad read, "We sell a home a minute. Every minute. Of every day. Seven days 
a week. Fifty-two weeks a year. No one else can make that claim. No one else 
even comes close. No one in the world sells as many homes as the Century 21." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Ellison, the owner of Century 21 Casa Grande in Santa Ana, said her 
franchise elected not to run the ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our ads are the truth, but if Re/Max is going to get technical, we're 
going to have to use the verbiage they want us to," she said.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: YOUR MONEY; PILGRIM EXEC FACES SUSPENSION IN SILENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palomba Weingarten has never minced words about her competitors and detractors 
in the mutual fund business. But the head of the L.A.-based Pilgrim Group funds 
is silent now as she faces what may be her biggest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 A regional committee within the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, the 
self-regulatory organization for brokers, has recommended that the 51-year-old 
Weingarten be suspended for one year as a principal of Pilgrim's funds 
distribution arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension -- and a suggested fine of $100,000 -- stem from the NASD's 
probe into Pilgrim fund advertising that set off a storm of controversy in the 
fund industry last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD committee ruled that Pilgrim ran ads containing "misleading or 
exaggerated statements" about the performance of some of its funds (mostly bond 
funds) and that Weingarten's conduct "was intentional" in creating the ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrim, in turn, insists that the disciplinary action is extraordinary 
relative to the charges leveled against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ads were not significantly different from other (fund) ads that appeared 
in the period," said Theodore J. Cohen, Pilgrim's general counsel. "Our view is 
that we were caught in the midst of an industry debate and that Pilgrim ads 
became the focus of that debate." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some fund industry experts concede they were shocked by the NASD 
recommendation of a one-year suspension for Weingarten. The ruling, issued May 
13 but made public Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal, is being appealed by 
Pilgrim to a national NASD committee. Meantime, the usually outspoken 
Weingarten is making no public statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very severe penalty," said Michael Lipper of fund tracker Lipper 
Analytical Services in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD ruling is the latest in a string of controversies that have dogged 
Weingarten and Pilgrim, which she acquired as majority shareholder in 1989. Her 
husband, Robert Weingarten, had run First Capital Holdings, an insurance 
company that was seized by California regulators in 1991 in the fallout of the 
junk bond market's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrim had been a part of First Capital until Palomba Weingarten bought it 
out. A former music professor-turned-stockbroker, she and her husband moved to 
Los Angeles in 1983 from New York City and began building Pilgrim/First Capital 
from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, the now $2.5-billion-asset Pilgrim fund company -- which manages 
mostly bond funds that invest in adjustable-rate mortgages -- has received much 
more unwanted publicity than most fund companies of its size: 
</P>
<P>
 * Competitors and independent fund analysts have criticized Pilgrim for its 
accounting practices on some of its bond funds, which have had the effect of 
overstating the funds' yields while costing shareholders a principal loss. For 
its part, Pilgrim has noted that its accounting is legal and that some other 
fund companies have used the same method. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1992, Pilgrim angered some shareholders by turning its open-end "prime 
rate" income fund into a closed-end fund, a move designed partly to halt 
potential shareholder redemptions at a time when that type of fund suddenly 
became unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earlier this year, Pilgrim agreed to reimburse one of its bond funds, the 
Pilgrim Adjustable Rate fund, for consultant fees the fund paid in the late 
1980s. The fund's board found that some of the fees were inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 But no issue has become as heated for Pilgrim as the one surrounding some of 
its advertising. In a January, 1993, ad in the Journal, Pilgrim labeled a 
series of its funds "No. 1," "No. 2," "No. 3" etc. under a headline that read, 
"Pilgrim Group is proud to announce the final 1992 Mutual Fund Rankings as 
determined by Lipper Analytical Services." 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD committee judged that the ad's headline "contains no qualification or 
explanation concerning the fact that the rankings refer to several limited 
categories" of mutual funds, rather than to the giant universe of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only qualification alluded to in the rankings is a footnote in the form 
of an asterisk placed in the upper right-hand corner of each number," the NASD 
said. "The asterisk refers to very small print at the bottom of the 
advertisement, which states, 'In its category.' (But) the qualifier does not 
disclose the specific categories selected to create the consecutively numbered 
rankings." 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD committee concluded, "We find . . . that the advertisements are false 
and misleading in their overall effect, contain exaggerated statements and omit 
material information" in violation of NASD fund marketing rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the ad first bubbled over when it was attacked by 
independent mutual fund rater Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, under a story that 
appeared in a Morningstar newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged, Weingarten sued Morningstar for libel, but the case was tossed out 
of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrim's Cohen argues that the Pilgrim ad became an unfair focal point as 
regulators were questioning fund industry ad practices in general. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission just recently approved long-awaited 
guidelines that sharply restrict how fund firms can use performance rankings, 
such as Lipper's, in ads. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming down hard on Pilgrim, Cohen contends, "part of the NASD's objective 
is to use Pilgrim to send (a) message" to the fund industry regarding ad 
practices. But a one-year suspension for Weingarten, Cohen charges, is a 
punishment "grossly disproportionate" to that imposed on other fund firms for 
allegedly misleading ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fund executives concede privately that Weingarten's brash and outspoken 
manner have long made her a target of criticism in the normally genteel fund 
world. In an interview last October in the Journal, she derided the 
behind-the-back talk about her style and about Pilgrim. "Disgusting," the 
Journal quoted her as saying. "If you want to criticize me, pick up the phone 
and say, 'Hey bitch, what about the ad?' Deal with me like a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pilgrim executives insist that disclosure of Weingarten's proposed 
suspension is not affecting Pilgrim investors. Day-to-day management of the 
funds is by individual portfolio managers, not Weingarten. But Pilgrim is 
dependent on major brokerages nationwide to sell its funds, so any adverse 
publicity can affect individual brokers' willingness to tout the Pilgrim name. 
</P>
<P>
 At Merrill Lynch & Co., a leading seller of Pilgrim funds, an executive said 
that "in terms of performance" of the funds, Merrill has no problem with 
Pilgrim. As for Weingarten's possible suspension, "We're aware of the situation 
and are monitoring it," said Allen N. Jones, Merrill's senior vice president 
for individual financial services.

THE CUTTING EDGE; EXERCISE IN UTILITY; GAS CO. HOPES 'GREEN DESIGN' BUILDING 
WILL SET AN EXAMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL KARON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In January, when visitors step into the lobby of Southern California Gas Co.'s 
newly opened Energy Resource Center in Downey, they'll find themselves standing 
on the wreckage of a condemned San Francisco warehouse, surrounded by a 
junkyard of smashed windows, wrecked airplanes and worn car tires. 
</P>
<P>
 But they won't see any of this detritus. What they will see is a relaxed, 
graciously appointed entrance area -- quiet, airy and plant-filled, illuminated 
by indirect sunlight and subtle electric bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no contradiction: The Energy Resource Center, now under construction, 
will be one of Southern California's first recycled buildings. It is also one 
of the world's most ambitious high-tech examples of the architecture and 
construction communities' new interest in what is known as green design, or 
sustainable architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a recognition that our environment is fragile," said Larry 
Wolff, principal of Wolff/Lang/Christopher Architects Inc. of Rancho Cucamonga, 
the design leader on the project. "People are now realizing that we have to 
start facing the music and do business a little differently." 
</P>
<P>
 The ERC, a demonstration building, is not just using a few recycled products 
here and there. It is being built mostly from parts of the Gas Co. office 
building that once stood on the site. Instead of demolishing the old structure, 
the company dismantled it and reused roughly 400 tons of material. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the 43,000-square-foot building will be composed of hundreds of 
innovative recycled products, ranging from nontoxic paints to new 
environmentally sensitive heating and air-conditioning systems to benches made 
from recycled plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas Co. officials and environmentalists hope the ERC will demonstrate to the 
public and the building industry that energy efficiency and environmental 
sensitivity can be not only effective and aesthetically pleasing, but also 
affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a perception out there that these things are horrendously more 
expensive to build," said Bill Browning, director of the Rocky Mountain 
Institute's Green Development Services, an environmental think tank in Old 
Snowmass, Colo. In fact, Browning says, the higher initial cost of sustainable 
architecture is often more than made up for in reduced energy and maintenance 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Gas Co. estimates the ERC will cost between $5.9 million and $6.5 million 
to build -- a figure that does not include an estimated $3.2 million saved by 
using materials from the old structure and by building on a site the company 
already owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff said the specifically green characteristics of the building will add 
somewhere between $225,000 and $275,000 to the final price. But features 
ranging from super-insulating windows to digital sensors that raise and lower 
the lights according to sunlight level will cut energy costs by an estimated 
$25,000 a year, thus canceling out the added expense in about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every major feature had to be just as financially feasible as it was 
environmentally correct," said John Picard, president of E2 Environmental 
Enterprises Inc., a Marina del Rey-based consulting firm that is the 
environmentalist on the ERC design team. "We're not painting a future that's 
out of reach. This technology is available for people who are building right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Sustainable architecture first became popular for a brief period in the late 
1960s and early 1970s, but interest soon dwindled as the energy crisis of 
1973-74 faded from memory. Recently, though, there have been signs that green 
design is again gaining attention as a way to reduce environmental destruction 
and rising energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see a groundswell (of interest in green design) taking hold right 
now," said Carl Costello, director of the Center for the Environment, a 
division of the American Institute of Architects in Washington. Costello's 
committee is only a few years old, but it already has 2,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the total number of sustainable design projects apparently remains 
small -- the Rocky Mountain Institute is tracking about 80 notable projects 
around the world -- they sometimes have a high profile: No lesser building than 
the White House itself was recently greened. The Gas Co. aims to gain more than 
good publicity from the ERC. When the California Public Utilities Commission 
deregulated the state's natural gas industry in 1988, large segments of the Gas 
Co.'s business were opened up to competition, forcing the utility to look 
beyond its traditional business. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its expanded mission, the company hopes to advise building owners 
not just on natural gas issues, but on a whole range of energy problems, 
including design issues that affect energy consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to plan, the ERC will never really be finished, Picard 
said. The ERC will adopt new lighting, air conditioning and other technologies 
and materials as they come to market. Innovative leasing agreements with an 
air-conditioning company and a company that makes carpeting from recycled 
materials call for the vendors to replace old equipment or worn carpeting over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Goulden, the Gas Co.'s senior project manager for the ERC, has worked 
on dozens of construction projects during his 25-year career, but he considers 
the ERC building one of the most exciting and important. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford to continue to do things the old way," he said. "The cost to 
the environment, to the Earth, is too high." Recycled Building 
</P>
<P>
 The Gas Co. is using a wide array of recycled material for its Energy Resouce 
Center in Downey, due to be completed in the spring of 1995. An existing office 
complex is being dismantled piece by piece and 60% to 70% of the old building 
will be incorporated into the new construction. Here's a look at how the 
company is using recycled or reused material: *A The Building 
</P>
<P>
 Part of a retired World War II Navy attack submarine will be melted down and 
used to make part of the building's steel frame. In addition, weapons 
confiscated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department have been melted 
down and will be used to make reinforcing bars. Recycled newspapers will make 
up the wall paneling, and the panels will be covered with sisal, a fabric made 
from recycled tropical plants. *B The Entry Walkway 
</P>
<P>
 Scraps of orange polyvinylcloride pipe that was used to transport natural gas 
underground will be chopped up and thrown into the concrete mix to add color. 
Hundreds of bricks from the original building facade will also be used on the 
walkway. *C The Parking Lot 
</P>
<P>
 Rubber automobile tires will be boiled and used as a slurry coat to resurface 
the parking lot. The rubber is expected to produce higher wear resistance and 
skid resistance, and reduce noise. *D The Reception Area 
</P>
<P>
 The floor will be made of Douglas fir beams and posts from the old Banana 
Republic warehouse in San Francisco, which was built in the 1890s and condemned 
after the Loma Prieta earthquake. An accent wall will be made entirely of 
recycled aircraft aluminum. The countertop of the reception area desk will be 
made of recycled tempered glass.

MAGNETEK TO SHIFT CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS TO NASHVILLE; MANUFACTURING: THE 
ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT MAKER SAYS RESTRUCTURING IS BEHIND THE MOVE, NOT 
UNHAPPINESS WITH CALIFORNIA. 
</P>

 This time, don't blame California's business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based MagneTek, a fast-growing maker and distributor of electrical 
equipment, said Tuesday that it is moving its corporate headquarters to 
Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 But MagneTek officials took pains to point out that they really do like 
California -- so much so that Andrew G. Galef, MagneTek chairman and chief 
executive, plans to stay in Los Angeles and run the firm long-distance with 
frequent visits to Tennessee. It's just that MagneTek is going through a 
corporate restructuring and plans to sell most of its operations in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just makes good sense for the business," spokeswoman Susan Halberstadt 
said, adding that most of MagneTek's factories and other facilities will be 
clustered in the Midwest and Southeast after the divestitures, which were 
announced in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be inaccurate to attribute this to the so-called negative business 
environment of California," Halberstadt said. "California is a wonderful 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, MagneTek will be sending about 50 administrative jobs to Nashville. In 
fact, 30 of those employees have already made the move, Halberstadt said. 
MagneTek expects to complete the transfer by next June. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the restructuring, the company employed 15,500 people, including 500 in 
California. After the divestitures, MagneTek will employ about 12,000, with 
very few in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We chose Nashville as our new home both because of its location at the 
geographic heart of the restructured company and the excellent business climate 
in the city and the state," Galef said at a news conference there. "We employ 
nearly 3,000 people in Tennessee -- almost a quarter of our total work force. . 
. . Moving our headquarters here should smooth operations and simplify business 
transactions at every level." 
</P>
<P>
 Economic development officials in Los Angeles and Sacramento were surprised by 
MagneTek's announcement, saying the company had given no hint of its plans. 
Still, they added, not much can be done to retain a firm that is leaving for 
internal business reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been out aggressively assisting companies where we can have an impact," 
said Mike Marando, spokesman for the California Trade and Commerce Agency. 
"Corporate restructurings are, by their very nature, confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we are sad to see them go, in this case we're delighted that this is 
not a business climate issue," Marando said. "A lot of companies are giving 
California a second look because of changes that have been made in the business 
climate in the last several months." 
</P>
<P>
 Those changes include last year's cleanup of the state's fraud-ridden workers' 
compensation system and tax incentives for companies that expand or modernize 
their plants. Also helpful have been an improving economy and lower real estate 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 MagneTek has grown at a fast clip in the last decade, with revenue hitting 
$1.5 billion in 1993. But much of that growth came from the acquisition of 
smaller electrical equipment firms, which led to a sizable debt. In addition, 
the company overestimated demand for its energy-efficient ballasts for 
fluorescent lighting, which resulted in excess inventory in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 MagneTek is undertaking the corporate overhaul to reduce debt, simplify its 
product mix and reduce administrative costs. The company intends to unload 
product lines that accounted for almost a third of the company's fiscal 1993 
sales. MagneTek at a Glance * Headquarters: Santa Monica, now relocating to 
Nashville, TN * Chief Executive: Andrew G. Galef * Employees: 14,000 * Major 
products: Motors, generators, transformers, lighting ballasts and commercial 
power supplies * 1993 revenue: $1.5 billion * 1993 loss: -$21.7 million *Loss 
per share: -$0.87 * Tuesday stock price: $14, down 12.5 cents Quarterly PROFIT 
AND LOSS In Millions of dollars: 1992: -41.98, Includes charges for 
post-retirement medical benefits; 1993: -42.50, Includes charge for 
restructuring; 1994: 1.68 Source: DataTimes; Standard & Poor's Corp. Researched

P&G TO BUY GIORGIO FOR $150 MILLION; FRAGRANCES: THE PURCHASE FROM AVON WILL 
MAKE PROCTER & GAMBLE A LEADER IN THE PRESTIGE PERFUME MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumer product giant Procter & Gamble, better known for the fragrances it 
mixes by the ton into Tide or Charmin, agreed Tuesday to purchase the posh 
Giorgio Beverly Hills fragrance line from Avon Products Inc. for $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years of floundering as an also-ran in the pricey prestige 
segment of the estimated $14-billion fragrance industry, P&G will immediately 
become a market leader. Three Giorgio fragrances -- Giorgio, Red and Wings -- 
rank among the nation's 15 top sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for toilet tissue or laundry detergent on the shelves, but included 
in the deal is the chichi boutique that Santa Monica-based Giorgio opened on 
Rodeo Drive in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Avon, meanwhile, will finally be able to fully concentrate on its more 
successful direct-marketing operations when it unloads the Giorgio division, 
which it has had on the auction block for several years. Although Giorgio sales 
grew to $165 million, the upscale line was an uneasy fit with the more 
mid-scale products that Avon sells in catalogues and door-to-door. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street was underwhelmed. P&G lost 12.5 cents to $54 a share Tuesday, and 
Avon fell by 75 cents to $57.625 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the move signals that big consumer product marketers still see 
room for growth in sales of pricey perfumes, despite increased consumer 
interest in discount prices and getting more for their money. Prestige 
fragrances, which are sold mainly in department stores for as much as $190 an 
ounce, remain the industry's biggest single segment, with global sales of 
nearly $6 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 With this acquisition, P&G's fragrance business will exceed $500 million, some 
$330 million of which is prestige fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet P&G was not even a player in that market until 1991, when it purchased Max 
Factor. Since then, the Cincinnati-based company, which makes Ivory soap and 
Pepto-Bismol, has also begun to market such upscale fragrances as Laura 
Biagiotti and Hugo Boss. Earlier this year, P&G and Salvatore Ferragamo, the 
Italian maker of designer shoes and clothing, announced plans to jointly create 
a luxury perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 P&G rival Unilever also entered the market in a big way in the early 1990s 
with its purchase of Elizabeth Arden and Calvin Klein Cosmetics, the maker of 
Obsession and Eternity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Procter & Gamble is a company that's more accustomed to saying, 'How many 
tons of laundry detergent do you need?' " said Andrew Shore, an analyst at the 
New York investment firm PaineWebber Inc. "But Procter's mass-market business 
in the U.S. is generally tapped out, so this is an area where they can grow -- 
and learn from a very successful brand." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts point out that P&G, which strives to be No. 1 in virtually 
every product category it enters, will probably invest far more in the Giorgio 
brand than Avon ever could. Last year, P&G posted worldwide sales of $30.4 
billion, compared to about $4 billion in revenue at Avon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really is no risk here for P&G," said Constance Maneaty, an analyst at 
the New York investment firm Bear, Stearns & Co. To P&G, she said, this 
investment "is lunch money." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective is to be the worldwide leader in fragrances," Edwin L. Artzt, 
chairman and chief executive of P&G, said in a statement. "Giorgio gives us a 
significantly stronger foothold in the U.S. prestige fragrance business." 
</P>
<P>
 But P&G, accustomed to mass marketing in supermarkets and drugstores, will now 
have to learn how to sell in department stores, PaineWebber's Shore noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts believe that P&G will try to capitalize on the familiar Giorgio 
name and market a number of products under that brand. Besides the fragrances, 
the Giorgio name also appears on everything from handbags to sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed 
in the third quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Giorgio openly welcomed news of the sale Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "P&G has a strategic goal to be the best at whatever they do," Linda LoRe, 
Giorgio president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. Avon, she 
noted, "made it very clear that Giorgio was not a strategic fit." 
</P>
<P>
 LoRe will remain president of Giorgio. She said there are "no indications" 
that P&G plans to make any significant changes to the company's 306-person work 
force.

 Judge Approves Settlement With Salomon: The $100-million accord came on a 
lawsuit by bond holders alleging that Salomon Bros. Inc. broke antitrust laws 
in a 1991 Treasury bond scandal.However, U.S. Dist. Judge Robert Patterson 
ruled that a quarter of the funds, or $25 million, will go to the attorneys who 
represent the bond holders in the litigation. He also approved another $3.5 
million in attorneys' expenses. Although the fees seem high, Patterson said, 
the case is unique. He praised the attorneys, saying their negotiations may 
have saved Salomon, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. The firm did not 
admit or deny guilt.

 United/Paramount Network Signs With New Affiliates: The proposed fifth 
broadcast network jointly owned by Paramount Pictures and Chris-Craft 
Industries said it signed up five new affiliates in Baltimore, Pittsburgh, 
Cincinnati, Milwaukee and Kansas City. The new affiliates boost the network's 
coverage to 52% from 47% of all U.S. households with TVs, but it is still far 
short of the 85% goal the network has set for its January, 1995, launch. The 
new affiliation agreements come only a week after Paramount and Chris-Craft 
restructured their joint venture to allow for TV station group Chris-Craft to 
take on a larger share of the network's financial burden.

 Mark Goodson Productions Explores Sale: The TV game show producer, whose shows 
include "The Price Is Right" and "Family Feud," said it has hired investment 
bank Lazard Freres & Co. to explore "strategic alternatives." The move follows 
a decision in May to pull out of Sony's proposed Game Show Channel after what 
insiders described as division about the company's future among the heirs of 
the late Mark Goodson, who died in 1992. Most observers expect Lazard to try to 
find a buyer for the company, whose chief asset is a library of TV game show 
episodes.

union were bargaining for a local contract at the Detroit-Hamtramck facility 
that builds most of the Cadillac line for General Motors Corp. Negotiators for 
UAW Local 22 and the company planned to meet through the night Tuesday. 
Unresolved issues involve safety, health, staffing levels and use of outside 
contractors.Workers were prepared to strike at 10 a.m. EDT today if no deal was 
made. "We've got more demands on the table than (can be handled in) the amount 
of time till the deadline," said Nate Gray, Local 22 plant chairman. "We'll be 
on strike unless they do some tall bellying up to the table." GM would not 
comment.

 Century 21 Loses Round in Court: A federal judge has ruled that Century 21 
Real Estate Corp. does not "sell a home every minute of the day," as the 
company's advertising says. Instead, the boldest claim the Irvine-based real 
estate franchise company can make is that it "helps sell a home on average 
every minute" of the day, said U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler, who 
granted a preliminary injunction last month to stop the Century 21 ads. A 
complaint had come from a major Century 21 competitor, Denver-based Re/Max 
International Inc. The two real estate giants have sued each other over who has 
the right to advertise itself as the nation's largest real estate franchise.

 Anti-Smoking Groups Strike Back at Tobacco Ads: The Coalition on Smoking or 
Health -- grouping the American Cancer Society, American Heart Assn. and 
American Lung Assn.-- went on the attack against the latest tobacco industry 
public relations efforts, calling them "smoke, lies and videotape." The 
coalition took aim in particular at ads questioning the health risks of 
secondhand smoke. "Arguing about the deadly effects of passive smoke is like 
discussing whether the world is really round," said Dr. Randolph Smoak, 
representing the American Medical Assn. at a news conference called by the 
coalition. A recent series of Philip Morris Cos. ads has questioned whether 
scientific research into secondhand smoke was sound and whether the data was 
"manipulated" for political ends.

 FCC Auction Prices Continue to Soar: As the second day of the Federal 
Communications Commissions' unprecedented auction of radio spectrum drew to a 
close, companies hoping to offer a new generation of paging services had 
offered a stunning $354 million for 10 nationwide paging licenses. The bids 
more than doubled the total that had been offered on the opening day of the 
auction, and even the opening day offers were far higher than most observers 
had expected.The tense bidding, which now appears to be dominated by half a 
dozen companies, will continue today. The high prices suggest that 
communications firms see many novel uses for paging services and that auctions 
of even more lucrative pocket telephone channels next year could raise tens of 
billions of dollars.

SMALLER SOUTHLAND FIRMS EXPECT HIGHER PROFITS; SURVEY: 75% WITH ANNUAL REVENUE 
OF UP TO $150 MILLION THINK THEY'LL DO BETTER IN THE NEXT YEAR. 
</P>

 Profits at small and mid-sized businesses in Southern California are 
rebounding, a large accounting firm said Tuesday, as the regional economy 
continues to slowly improve and banks become more willing to loan entrepreneurs 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey by Arthur Andersen & Co. found that three-fourths of Southern 
California's smaller companies expect profits to rise over the next 12 months, 
while only 11% say their profits will fall -- a more optimistic outlook than 
was recorded nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rebounding profits could soon translate into more jobs. Executives at 
nearly half the 369 local companies responding to the survey said they plan to 
hire more workers this year, compared to 29% of the 747 firms that were polled 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses in Southern California are much more confident about their future 
today than they were a year ago, and for good reason," said Craig Isom, an 
Arthur Andersen partner who worked on the survey. "The companies that have 
survived the recession we've had over the past three years have emerged lean 
and mean, and they're making money." 
</P>
<P>
 The accounting firm defines small and mid-sized businesses as those that 
generate $1 million to $150 million in annual revenue. Arthur Andersen polled 
firms in the state's seven southernmost counties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which was conducted in May, found that 72% of the small and 
mid-sized businesses in the region recorded net profits in their latest fiscal 
or calendar years. That was up from 62% the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the companies polled said they plan to stay in California, the 
same percentage as a year ago. The 20% that said they were "considering or 
planning a move" blamed high local and state taxes, business regulations or the 
state's often-maligned workers' compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the survey's generally bullish results, Isom noted that about half the 
companies said they're still worried about the region's "recessionary 
environment" and competition from other U.S. companies. Only 12% had concerns 
about competition from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the separate survey of 747 companies nationwide, Arthur Andersen found that 
61% of the firms expect higher profits over the next 12 months but only 29% 
expect to hire more workers.

DTS PREPARES TO TURN ITS EAR TO SONY CHALLENGE; TECHNOLOGY: THE TWO MAKERS OF 
DIGITAL SOUND SYSTEMS HOPE TO BECOME THE PROVIDER OF CHOICE FOR MOVIE THEATERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Digital Theater Systems is close to resolving a legal dispute with a French 
rival, a step that will free the company to turn its attention to Sony Corp., 
its latest major challenger in the competition to bring digital sound to movie 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 DTS, based in Westlake Village, will purchase worldwide rights to the digital 
sound patent of L.C. Concept of Paris under an agreement expected to be signed 
within a week. DTS and its part-owner, Universal Studios, will agree to drop 
several lawsuits they filed against L.C. in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital movie sound is similar in quality to that of compact discs used in 
home stereo systems. Through computer technology, it offers tones that are free 
of the hisses and pops that sometimes plague traditional movie soundtracks. 
DTS' hardware is now in more than 2,000 theaters worldwide, giving it a leg up 
on competitor Dolby Laboratories of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sony is likely to pose as big a challenge. After several delays, it plans 
to introduce its Sony Dynamic Digital Sound system in 150 of its 900 Sony 
Theatres (formerly Loews Theatres) by the end of the year, said Jim Fiedler, 
SDDS president. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the company also has firm commitments from other exhibitors and 
expects to see its sound format on non-Sony Pictures Entertainment movies soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Neighbors, DTS vice president and general manager, said the company is 
not fazed by Sony's entry. "We're just selling units and making movies," he 
said. But he added of Sony, "I take them very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony is arriving late in a business that received its first big push last 
summer with Universal's release of Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" in DTS 
sound. Spielberg, along with Universal, is an investor in DTS. 
</P>
<P>
 DTS is used in several big summer films, such as Spielberg's "The 
Flintstones," MGM's "Blown Away" and New Line Cinema's "The Mask," which opens 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the studios are splitting their bets on digital sound formats. Twentieth 
Century Fox's "Speed" and the Arnold Schwarzenegger hit "True Lies" are out in 
both DTS and Dolby digital sound formats, as is Paramount Pictures' "Forrest 
Gump" and the upcoming "Clear and Present Danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Disney's blockbuster "The Lion King" is a top box office draw in 
Dolby sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Sony's delay in getting its system to market, most acknowledge that 
the Japanese firm, with its vast resources, will be a significant force. Its 
pitch to exhibitors is that its system offers better sound quality and 
durability than those of its rivals. Sony's is also the only system to offer a 
digital track backup.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sony is the 800-pound gorilla in this thing," said Bill Mead, vice president 
of film marketing at Dolby.  
</P>
<P>
 All motion pictures from Sony Pictures Entertainment -- Columbia Pictures, 
TriStar, Sony Pictures Classics and Triumph Releasing -- will feature SDDS. 
Columbia's "The Next Karate Kid," opening Aug. 5, will be the first film in 
major release using the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitors have been reluctant to adopt one audio format over another, 
convinced that eventually the industry will embrace one standard. But at the 
moment, some cinemas are investing in more than one digital sound system.

EARNINGS; RJR NABISCO PROFIT DROPS BUT OPERATING RESULTS IMPROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., the huge food and tobacco concern, said that 
second-quarter earnings fell due to expenses from early debt retirement, but 
operating results rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The maker of brands such as Winston and Camel cigarettes, Oreo cookies and 
Ritz crackers said operating earnings were up 11% from tobacco and 20% from 
continuing operations in food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the food and tobacco businesses had a very strong second quarter," said 
Charles M. Harper, chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the domestic tobacco business, caught in a fierce price war a year 
ago, continues to rebound from last year's weak earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Including extraordinary items and preferred dividend payments, RJR said net 
income skidded to $14 million, or 1 cent per common share, in the three months 
ended June 30 compared to $70 million, or 6 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The results for the latest quarter reflect a $146-million loss on early 
retirement of debt and preferred stock dividend payments of $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The results for a year ago were reduced by $65 million for early debt 
retirement and reflected $7 million in preferred stock dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue rose 2% to $3.78 billion from $3.72 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating income rose 16% overall to $675 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital Equipment Corp. said it lost an expected $1.7 billion in its fiscal 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives aim to make the computer company profitable by the end of this year 
and earlier this month announced a $1.2-billion charge to accelerate a cut of 
20,000 jobs from two years to one. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the special charge, Digital's loss narrowed compared to its third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital's loss for the quarter ending July 2 amounted to $12.64 per share. The 
company earned $113.2 million, or 85 cents a share, in the same period a year 
ago, its only profitable quarter since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest period included the $1.2-billion restructuring charge and $380 
million in non-cash reductions. Without those items, Digital lost $160.4 
million, or $1.22 per share. It lost $183 million in its third fiscal quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for the latest period was $3.99 billion, up 2% from $3.91 billion in 
the fourth quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boeing Co. reported a 48% drop in second-quarter profit on sharply lower 
sales and said commercial jet deliveries are expected to remain low through 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerospace company said net earnings for the three months ended June 30 
were $222 million, or 65 cents per share, compared with $426 million, or $1.25 
per share, for the comparable 1993 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-quarter sales for 1994 were $5.4 billion, down 32% from the nearly $8 
billion reported in the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower earnings for the quarter are due mainly to fewer commercial aircraft 
deliveries, lower corporate investment income and higher interest expenses, the 
Seattle-based company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by its domestic materials and office products divisions, Avery Dennison 
Corp. reported a 22% increase in second-quarter net income on a 9% increase in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery posted net income totaling $27.9 million, up from last year's $22.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings per share of the Pasadena-based company rose 28% to 50 cents, as 
sales increased 9% to $718.6 million over the $662.2 million a posted a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our best quarter since the merger of Avery and Dennison in late 
1990," said company spokeswoman Diane Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery Dennison, the world's largest supplier of pressure-sensitive adhesive 
material, makes home and office products that mark, decorate, identify, 
organize and fasten under the brand name Avery. 
</P>
<P>
 Beset by Japanese rivals, sluggish European markets and an inability to raise 
prices at home or abroad, Rochester, N.Y.-based Eastman Kodak Co. said earnings 
dropped 29% in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's leading photographic products company earned $264 million, or 79 
cents a share, in the three months ended June 30, compared to profits of $371 
million, or $1.13 a share, in the same period a year ago. Sales edged up to 
$3.47 billion from $3.41 billion.

EARNINGS; DROP IN REFINERY PROFITS SQUEEZES BIG OIL COMPANIES; ENERGY: 
QUARTER'S RESULTS ARE BLAMED ON A JUMP IN CRUDE PRICES, STEADY PRICES AT THE 
PUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An early summer squeeze on refinery profits has caused a sharp drop in major 
oil company earnings in the second quarter, with the latest to report -- San 
Francisco-based Chevron Corp. -- disclosing a 54% fall in operating income. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-quarter results came mostly from a modest jump in crude oil prices 
without an equivalent rise in gasoline prices at the pump. Unocal Corp. on 
Monday reported a 43% drop in profit, and Atlantic Richfield Co. a 91% fall, 
compared to the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 West Texas intermediate crude oil, the U.S. benchmark, was below $16 a barrel 
at the beginning of the quarter but rose above $19 by the end. But in the 
intensely competitive retail gasoline market, prices at the pump didn't rise as 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 This squeezed refinery margins by as much as 30% to 50% at West Coast 
refineries, according to John Vautrain, manager of the Long Beach office of 
Purvin & Gertz, a refinery consulting firm. "It hasn't averaged that bad in a 
long, long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While crude oil prices rose during the quarter, they did not increase enough 
to offset the drop in refinery profits for the major oil companies. Even at 
$19, crude prices were an average of $2 a barrel cheaper than in the summer of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Refiners got squeezed on that because they couldn't pass along the higher 
prices," said J. Robinson West, president and chief executive of 
Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co. "The refining business is a highly 
capital-intensive, low-margin business." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing that squeeze coming, many companies made the most of a bad situation by 
lining up special charges -- almost all due to company restructuring -- and 
lumping them into the second-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 For many companies, "everything but the kitchen sink went in there," said 
Holly Gustafson, an energy analyst with NatWest Securities Washington Analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other analysts, however, see better earnings across the board in the 
next quarter as gasoline prices continue to catch up this summer because of 
increased summer driving and an improved economy. That doesn't necessarily mean 
significantly higher prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have an extra-strong demand, even for the season, and you have a stronger 
economy," said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Los Angeles-based Lundberg 
Survey, which tracks retail gasoline trends. "Prices could go up . . . but more 
likely they will hover around this level." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Vautrain already sees some easing of the squeeze on refinery 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The latest data I have is that margins are improving a bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the second-quarter earnings for major U.S. oil companies: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chevron Corp. had earnings of $262 million, down from $565 million in the 
second quarter of 1993. While Chevron declared only $5 million in special 
charges in the 1994 second quarter, the previous year it recorded $515 million 
in special charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Phillips Petroleum Co. had earnings of $60 million, compared to $137 million 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exxon Corp. earnings fell to $885 million from $1.24 billion a year ago, 
when the company had a onetime gain of $210 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arco's earnings fell to $24 million from last year's $271 million. The 
decline reflects net charges of $154 million for restructuring costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unocal said earnings fell to $50 million from $88 million a year earlier. 
The company reported special charges of $15 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mobil Corp. profit dropped to $198 million from $579 million a year ago. It 
includes an after-tax charge of $315 million. Last year's second-quarter 
earnings also included $60 million in special benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Texaco Inc. had earnings of $115 million, compared to $312 million in the 
same quarter of 1993. It took a special charge of $119 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amoco Corp. earnings fell to $410 million from $487 million a year ago. The 
company took a $256-million after-tax charge against earnings, offset by a gain 
of $270 million as part of a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service.

 NYSE Chairman to Step Down: William H. Donaldson announced that he will not 
seek a new term at the New York Stock Exchange. Donaldson, 63, co-founder of 
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, was reportedly under pressure from some members of 
the exchange's board.Donaldson said he joined the Big Board with the intention 
of stepping down after one term and that he did not feel any pressure resign. 
"I made the decision because I felt the speculation going around was not 
constructive," he said. "We have accomplished a hell of a lot." Richard Grasso, 
the exchange's president and a veteran NYSE executive, is considered the 
leading candidate to succeed Donaldson. The outgoing chairman declined to say 
what he plans to do after he leaves.

YOUR MONEY; WORKERS' PAY RISES AT HISTORICALLY LOW RATE; LABOR: ECONOMISTS SAY 
THE GOVERNMENT FIGURES ON COMPENSATION SHOW INFLATION REMAINS IN CHECK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Compensation for American workers grew at a historically slow pace in the 
second quarter of the year, the government said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department's employment cost index provides the latest evidence that 
inflation remains in check, economists said. It shows that worker compensation 
rose at an annual rate of 3.2%, the same as in the 12 months ended March 30, 
which was the smallest increase on record. 
</P>
<P>
 The report shows there is "no convincing sign" of inflation in the economy, 
said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The index, created in 1982, measures changes in wages, salaries and employer 
costs for employee benefits such as health insurance, vacations and sick leave. 
It is considered one of the best gauges of wage inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wages and salaries, which constitute 72% of total worker compensation, edged 
up 3%, the Labor Department said. Benefit costs were up 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation "remains contained on the labor level," said economist Robert Barr 
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "You would expect that if the strong economy 
was indeed going to push us into a much higher level of inflation, there would 
be higher numbers at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 A continuing slowdown in the cost of health insurance, workers' compensation 
and state unemployment insurance helped moderate the increase in benefit costs. 
Health insurance and workers' comp costs are the most rapidly rising expenses 
for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Worker salaries and benefits represent about two-thirds of the cost of a 
product, and holding the line on increases in compensation allows businesses to 
offer goods at the lowest possible prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Wages and salaries rose 0.8% in the second quarter after a 0.7% increase in 
the first three months of the year. Benefit costs increased to 1%, after a 0.9% 
gain in the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists pay more attention to the annual rates because they smooth out 
fluctuations seen in the more volatile quarterly figures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department reported separately that contracts negotiated by unions 
for their members in the second quarter of this year provided annual wage 
increases that were smaller than those called for in the agreements they 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreements reached during the period had wage increases averaging 2.3% in the 
first year and 2.4% over the life of the contracts. The agreements they 
replaced had increases averaging 2.9% in the first year and 3% over the life of 
the contracts.

THE CUTTING EDGE / COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTIES; PATENT POLICIES ON TRIAL; LAW: SCREEN-SAVING BUNNY CASE RAISES 
CONCERNS ABOUT USING THE MEDIA TO PRESSURE A U.S. AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES EVANS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Instead of waiting for his day in court, PC Dynamics President Peter Avritch 
decided to go straight to the top in defending his company against what 
appeared to be an unreasonable patent-infringement lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Avritch sent two-foot-tall stuffed pink rabbits and pleas for help to U.S. 
Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). He spent days 
on the telephone enlisting support from colleagues and rivals. Perhaps most 
important, he told his tale of woe to the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign had one goal: to force the Patent and Trademark Office into an 
uncommon re-examination of a patent award. Its eventual success has unnerved 
many in the intellectual property community, who abhor the idea of complex 
copyright and trademark disputes being judged in the court of public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The patent, held by Software Advertising Corp. of La Costa, Calif., is for a 
process that inserts advertising into computer software. PC Dynamics, a small 
Westlake Village software company, markets a screen saver -- a program that 
prevents images from being burned into a computer screen -- featuring the 
Eveready Energizer Bunny. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble was, the popular drum-beating rabbit advertised Eveready 
batteries. From Software Advertising's perspective, any advertising that 
appeared on a computer was infringing its patent, so it demanded a royalty from 
PC Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 Avritch denounced the patent as absurd and a danger to the software industry, 
comparing it to someone owning the rights to printing business logos on coffee 
cups. But even justified indignation isn't a shield from damage awards and 
bankruptcy. Avritch saw that if he chose to engage in a court struggle, the 
cost could kill PC Dynamics even if it emerged victorious. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Avritch decided to test what he had learned from a case involving 
Carlsbad, Calif.-based Compton's New Media.  
</P>
<P>
 The patent office last August granted Compton's a broad patent on multimedia 
search and retrieval processes, meaning that just about anyone in the 
burgeoning multimedia field -- from movie studios to computer companies -- 
would owe royalties to Compton's. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting storm of protest caused the patent office, under the direction 
of a new, politically savvy commissioner, Bruce Lehman, to rescind the patent 
in March -- an extremely rare move. (Compton's has since reapplied for the 
patent.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the Compton's case, the reversal was provoked by a spontaneous show of 
anger. But Avritch saw that an orchestrated publicity effort could achieve the 
same end. Sure enough, Lehman announced in May that the patent office would 
re-examine the Software Advertising Corp. patent. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision has alarmed some patent attorneys, who say the patent office may 
begin paying more attention to the roar of media ridicule than to the rule of 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patent office is supposed to protect the public and not adopt the 
interests of one particular group," said Ronald Yin, a patent specialist in the 
San Francisco law firm Limbach & Limbach. "The commissioner should not be 
forced by outside sources to perform certain acts. But the precedent has been 
set, and other companies likely will look to use the same tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all lawyers are worried. David Hayes, who heads the intellectual property 
practice at Fenwick & West in Palo Alto, believes that manipulation of the 
patent office through the media will be a short-lived phenomenon.  
</P>
<P>
 It has succeeded in a few cases, he says, only because it serves Lehman's 
agenda of reforming the patent system. 
</P>
<P>
 He agrees that other companies will probably engage in patent lobbying, but he 
doubts Lehman will be susceptible to them for long.

THE CUTTING EDGE / COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; PLOWSHARES; HIGH-TECH 
BLASTING CAPS OFFER SAFER WAY TO SET OFF EXPLOSIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weapons experts who are trying to channel their skills into civilian projects 
in the post-Cold War era often have to venture far from their traditional 
specialties to find promising projects. But at least one team has found 
something right up its alley: blasting caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Explosives used in mining, oil fields and other industrial applications are 
set off by electronically controlled blasting caps that are so sensitive they 
can be accidentally fired by something as weak as a cellular phone transmission 
or a static electricity shock from the human body. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at New Mexico's Los Alamos National Laboratory, birthplace of the 
atomic bomb, have come up with a high-tech blasting cap that greatly reduces 
the threat of such accidents. Initially developed as a way to more safely fire 
missiles and bombs, the new cap uses a laser to set off the explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The optical detonation system is safer than electrical systems because no 
naturally occurring event and few man-made events can deliver enough optical 
power to inadvertently fire the explosive," said Dennis Paisley of the 
Detonation Systems Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: A laser pulse is directed into one end of a quartz cable 
encased in rubber. The light beam travels down the cable and strikes a small 
aluminum cap on the other end. The intense light vaporizes a thin layer of the 
aluminum, generating a plasma gas that expands rapidly. The expanding gas then 
shoves the aluminum plate forward at the speed of a high-powered bullet, and 
the plate slams into a target of compressed explosive powder. The small charge 
explodes, setting off the main blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamos scientists believe the new system is so safe that workers could 
remain in the field during blasting sessions without the danger of accidentally 
setting off an explosion nearby. It has many other potential applications, such

LOCAL MANUFACTURERS REPORT GROWTH IN 2ND QUARTER; ECONOMY: IT IS THE THIRD 
CONSECUTIVE PERIOD OF INCREASING ACTIVITY, ACCORDING TO CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY 
PURCHASING INDEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Manufacturing in Orange County has been at the top of the economy's hit list 
since the beginning of the 1990 recession, but the economy appears finally to 
have stopped taking aim at this key sector of the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Local manufacturers said their businesses grew during the second quarter, 
economists at Chapman University report in their latest survey of purchasing 
managers at 80 Orange County-based manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's purchasing index -- a measure of economic confidence -- remained in 
growth territory at 56.0 for the three months ended June 30 -- the third 
consecutive quarter of increasing activity. That was down from 59.5 for the 
first quarter, but all index measures higher than 50 mean growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the survey posted a string of three growth quarters was in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks good, like a trend," said Raymond Sfeir, the Chapman economist who 
conducts the survey modeled after a national manufacturing confidence index. 
The national index rose to 57.5 for the second quarter from 57 for the previous 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were down a little bit this time, but it's still positive, so we'll take 
it," Sfeir said. "There were fewer negative comments about the economy than 
I've seen in years, and a lot of the respondents said they thought the third 
quarter would be even better." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey measures seven key components of manufacturing industry health; the 
purchasing index is a composite of them. Purchasing managers are surveyed 
because they are on the front lines, responsible for anticipating what a 
factory's production demands will be and for acquiring the materials needed to 
meet those requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 45% of the managers responding to the second-quarter survey said new 
orders for their factories' goods increased during the period, while only 19.6% 
said that orders declined. That compared to 40.5% who reported growth in the 
first quarter and 25.6% who reported decreases. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of companies that laid off workers grew slightly in the second 
quarter -- to 25.7% from 24.6% -- but that layoff figure was offset by an 
increase in hiring at 31.2% of the companies, up from 26.1% in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting on production, 57.3% of the purchasing managers -- the largest 
number since the third quarter of 1988 -- said production levels increased 
between the beginning of April and the end of June. That was up from 53.3% in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 While the survey covers all facets of manufacturing, Sfeir has begun charting 
a separate index for high-technology companies, because they are such a 
significant part of the industrial base in the county and have been hit 
particularly hard during the recession. The combination of a weak economy and 
federal defense budget cuts has led to the loss of about 23,000 jobs in 
high-technology manufacturing in Orange County since the recession began in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Signs of improvement in the high-tech industries are appearing more 
frequently," Sfeir said, with production levels and new orders both climbing in 
the second quarter. "Unfortunately, employment was worse than in the first 
quarter," he said, with layoffs occurring at 43% of the factories responding. 
</P>
<P>
 One high-tech purchasing manager wrote on the survey form: "The good news is 
that we appear to have bottomed . . . I hope." 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak in 1986, high-technology manufacturing accounted for 93,300 jobs 
in Orange County. The same field now employs 59,000, according to the state 
Employment Development Department. Much of the job loss has occurred in the 
electronic and computer equipment industries, which now have 35,000 employees 
-- down from 71,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, there are 206,900 manufacturing jobs in the county, about 18.5% of 
total employment. That is down from a 1988 high of 254,300, or 22.5% of all 
employment. Manufacturing Gains 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's manufacturing industries reported moderate growth in the 
second quarter. Chapman University's Purchasing Managers Composite Index 
measures six factors -- among them inventories, new orders, production and raw 
material purchases -- and gauges industry activity and managers' confidence in 
the economy. A level of 50 or more indicates growth; less than 50, decline.

EPA WILL HALT KILN'S BURNING OF WASTES; GORMAN: THE PROMISED FEDERAL ACTION 
AGAINST NATIONAL CEMENT IS A VICTORY FOR DESERT ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a victory for a small but dedicated band of desert lovers, the U. S. 
Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that a cement company will be 
ordered this week to stop burning hazardous waste at a kiln near Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 The promised EPA action is the latest round in a long-running battle between 
Desert Citizens Against Pollution, an environmental group, and National Cement 
Co. of California, which burns spent, hazardous solvents in the kiln to 
generate heat needed in the cement-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted," Stormy Williams, of Desert Citizens, said Tuesday. "We've 
worked long and hard on this, ever since 1989, when we found out what they were 
burning" at the kiln site near the Los Angeles-Kern County line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a very small group with no money," added Williams, who lives in Kern 
County, about 35 miles from the incinerator. "But we're like desert tortoises 
-- just aim us and we go slow but sure until we get there." 
</P>
<P>
 National Cement and previous operators of the kiln have conducted two 
businesses on the site for a dozen years -- making cement and burning hazardous 
waste. The EPA has said the incinerator is the only operating commercial 
hazardous waste burner in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an area of high winds," Williams said. "One of our biggest worries 
about the incinerator has been dioxin," a toxic substance. "One of its favorite 
ways of traveling is to hook onto other particles blowing in the wind." 
</P>
<P>
 In a report released in May, EPA scientists concluded that the wind-borne 
dioxin could harm fetal development and immune systems. Many of the scientists' 
conclusions were based on animal studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Donohue, spokeswoman for the EPA's San Francisco office, said that 
office "would definitely issue the order within the next few days" against 
National Cement and Systech Environmental Corp., which receives and processes 
hazardous waste at the kiln site. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will then be required to stop burning the waste within two weeks after 
we issue the letter," Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>
 National Cement is a unit of Vicat, a large French cement concern. Lafarge, 
another large French cement maker, owns Systech Environmental. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest move by the EPA follows its refusal Friday to hear National 
Cement's petition appealing the agency's earlier attempt to stop the company 
from burning hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 In that decision, which came in March, the EPA denied National Cement a permit 
required for it to burn the waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Given those earlier setbacks, National Cement's chief operating officer, 
Michel Plagnol, said the EPA's Tuesday announcement was not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Plagnol said the company will appeal the order to the U. S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco. He added that the firm will also seek permission to 
keep operating the incinerator until the court acts on its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The court is expected to hear National Cement's appeal before the ban would go 
into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Plagnol said the appeal is probably National Cement's last resort in a long 
and bitter dispute that has also involved Tejon Ranch Co., which owns the land 
where the kiln is. Tejon Ranch is about 30% owned by Times Mirror Co., 
publisher of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, National Cement came close to an agreement to buy the 240-acre 
kiln site from Tejon Ranch. That agreement fell through in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Plagnol said National Cement and Tejon Ranch were still discussing a possible 
sale. But he said he doubted that a deal could be worked out soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not been able to reach an agreement for quite a long time," Plagnol 
said. "So I don't think it would be possible to achieve that within the next 
coming weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Mullins, Tejon Ranch's general counsel, denied that the two companies 
were still in negotiations over the kiln site. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (National Cement) said last July they were no longer interested in 
buying the land," Mullins said. "They have not told us any time since then they 
have changed their minds and are now once again interested."

MTA STRIKE'S 2ND DAY GOES BY THE RULES; LABOR: UNION MEMBERS BLOCK VEHICLES AT 
SUN VALLEY BUS DEPOT. BUT THE ROUTE DELAYS ARE RESTRICTED TO FOUR MINUTES EACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Everyone seemed to have a rough idea of the rules: The strikers agreed to hold 
up departing buses for four minutes, no more, no less. The supervisors who had 
replaced them in the driver's seats waited patiently, joking with the strikers 
before getting permission to move on. And police kept their distance, choosing 
the comfort of their air-conditioned squad cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really mind; we understand the situation," said a smiling 
supervisor, who was filling in as a driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're trying to do is to detain them a little," said a grinning Robert 
Blackwood, a striking bus mechanic. "They understand what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just here to make sure everything goes smoothly," Los Angeles Police 
Officer Todd Trulock said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went at a picket line at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 
Sun Valley bus depot Tuesday -- the second day of a strike against the agency 
by its mechanics, which is also being honored by drivers and clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 During a day when all suffered under the same hot sun, there was a strange 
camaraderie between the 40 or so strikers and their bosses -- even as union 
members tried to block buses by standing in front of them for as long as 
possible, while their bosses wanted nothing more than to get to their routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were holding them up for seven or 10 minutes earlier this morning," said 
Blackwood, who made sure that the drivers knew the holdup was not personal by 
bidding each of them a good day. "But they (the police) cut it to about four." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, though, the agreed-upon four-minute delay actually stretched to a 
quarter of an hour without anyone seeming to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for cars and buses to block, the strikers talked about their 
greatest concern: the MTA's growing reliance on subcontracting duties that 
union members had previously performed. Their other big worry is that the 
public perceives them as overpaid and spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The MTA) says we're in a hole," bus driver and shop steward Ed Hanger said. 
"But hey, we didn't do it. We didn't tell them to put all their money in rail 
and . . . spend thousands of dollars on newspaper ads attacking the union." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Steve Patterson, an MTA service attendant: "They're trying to balance 
their budget on the backs of guys making $30,000 or $40,000 a year. Why not 
start the cost-cutting at the top?" 
</P>
<P>
 While the strikers remained mostly good-natured on their second day out, 
occasionally they applied the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are crossing the picket line, and we've asked you not to," Dane Sheldon, 
an executive board member of the striking Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1277, 
said as a substitute driver tried to exit the bus yard. "You don't have 
anything to lose here?" 
</P>
<P>
 After the driver turned away, Sheldon backed off. "I was pushing it a little, 
huh?" he asked sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
 By late morning, they were told that a Los Angeles police captain had surveyed 
their strike line and was unhappy about it. "He said what we are doing is 
illegal," Sheldon informed the group. "We need to walk a line, or he's going to 
arrest somebody for blocking the street." 
</P>
<P>
 So the strikers started walking back and forth, causing largely the same 
result: No cars or buses could come in or out of the bus yard without waiting 
four minutes -- or thereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, outside the San Fernando Valley's other MTA depot, in Chatsworth, 
there was precious little goodwill Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the MTA wasn't driving any buses out of that yard, a dozen strikers -- 
including drivers, mechanics and clerks -- had plenty of time to fume. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers said stress is unavoidable in their profession, with its tight 
schedules, complaining passengers and the occasional armed motorist aiming a 
gun at an MTA driver. Some said they were angry enough to vote against the 
tentative agreement that the driver's union reached last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You give me another choice for a job and, if I make the same money, I'll be 
flying out of there," said Guillermo Munoz, a driver for 14 years. "We get no 
respect, and we've had it." Valley Emergency Bus Routes 
</P>
<P>
 For the duration of the strike, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has 
established emergency service on seven of the San Fernando Valley's busiest 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fewer buses on those lines, however, and MTA officials cautioned 
passengers to expect to wait twice as long as usual between buses. For example, 
they said, if a bus normally reaches a particular stop every 20 minutes, buses 
on the emergency lines will probably arrive up to 40 minutes apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The buses also run shorter hours, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. only. All buses on the 
Valley routes are free except those on the Van Nuys Boulevard line, which cost 
50 cents.

TENANTS TO BUY HOME OF THEIR OWN; REAL ESTATE: UNDER 1990 FEDERAL LAW KNOWN AS 
TITLE 6, RENTERS RAISE $8 MILLION IN FINANCING TO PURCHASE THEIR HUD-SUBSIDIZED 
APARTMENT BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For 14 years, Dorissa Gomes has lived at the Astoria Gardens Apartments. And 
in that time, she's had virtually no say over anything that's happened there. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about to change as she and the other Astoria Gardens renters prepare to 
become homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take good care of it," Gomes said of her building. "We're 
going to make sure all the apartments are up to par." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first purchase of its kind in Los Angeles, tenants of the low-income 
Sylmar apartment complex at 14009 Astoria St. have raised nearly $8 million in 
financing and are on their way to buying and managing their 136-unit building. 
</P>
<P>
 The pending purchase began last year when residents learned that their 
apartments were up for sale -- and that a new landlord potentially could raise 
rents. They mobilized, eventually deciding that the only way to have a say at 
the federally subsidized complex was to control it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we can do it ourselves and feel more responsible," said Gomes, who 
serves as secretary of the Astoria Gardens Tenants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than two months, the group -- most of whose members have never owned 
their own home -- organized a development team that includes a manager and four 
attorneys working on a pro bono basis. They also secured the purchase money 
through the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Los 
Angeles Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The current owners of the complex verbally agreed to the sale early this 
month, according to Tony Morales of the Los Angeles Center for Affordable 
Tenant Housing, and the residents at Astoria Gardens should gain control of it 
in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales, who spearheaded the deal, said this is the first area purchase of a 
HUD-subsidized complex by tenants under a 1990 law known as Title 6. 
</P>
<P>
 That law, he said, requires that tenants in HUD-subsidized buildings be given 
first option to buy when their homes are put up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Mona Tawatao, one of two attorneys from San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal 
Services working with the Astoria Gardens group, described the law as a sort of 
rent-control device for low-income housing complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many mortgage agreements on privately owned, HUD-subsidized buildings allow 
rent increases after 20 years, Tawatao said. Title 6 not only encourages 
tenants to purchase the properties and set their own rents, it also offers the 
owner incentives to sell to the tenants, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another similar tenant purchase in San Gabriel has recently received 
preliminary approval from the owner, Morales said, adding that another 104 such 
buyouts of HUD buildings were expected to be in place by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the primary idea behind Title 6 is to make sure that low-income buildings 
don't wind up with sky-high rents, there is a side benefit for Gomes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like, hey, this is ours," she said. "We're going to take good care 
of it."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; ON-RAMP TO INTERNET BEING BUILT AT MAGNET

<P>
 There's no big orange sign to mark it, but the first on-ramp to the 
information superhighway from a San Fernando Valley public school is under 
construction at one of the Los Angeles district's newest magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and coordinators at Grant High School's communication technology 
magnet are spending the summer setting up computers and putting together a 
curriculum that will introduce students to global communication through 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very excited about it," said Ellis Kaufman, coordinator of the new 
magnet. "We are out there, pioneering something." 
</P>
<P>
 The 180-student magnet, one of 10 new magnet schools in the Valley, will also 
focus on radio, television and video production. 
</P>
<P>
 No other schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District have formal 
programs to use Internet already in place, according to the district's 
information technology division. But Garfield High School in Los Angeles and a 
new magnet at the Los Angeles Public Library are starting similar programs this 
year, and will serve as models for future districtwide communication programs. 
The district is awaiting word on an application for a $2.4-million federal 
grant to link 26 high schools to Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we really want to do is to have all teachers and students have access to 
Internet," said Andy Rogers, a coordinator for the information technology 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet program at Grant in Van Nuys will feature a 20-computer lab and up 
to eight computers in each of six classrooms, linked together so that students 
can share information from different classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is expose our students to all of these technologies so 
they can function in a global community," Kaufman said. "Students on the high 
school level are just not being prepared for that new world." 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 100 spaces open for ninth- and 10th-graders at the Grant 
magnet, which is housed on the campus of Grant High. For information, call 
(818) 781-1400. SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; DISTRICT OPENS 8 NEW CITIZENSHIP CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the rapidly growing number of immigrants expected to apply for 
naturalization in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Unified School District has 
opened eight new citizenship preparation centers, for a total of 15, at its 
adult school locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most citizenship institutions that only offer classes in language and 
preparation for the written examination, the district's centers are a one-stop 
shop for the often-confusing naturalization process. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Alma Gamez, assistant principal of the Van Nuys Community Adult 
School, which boasts one of the district's most culturally diverse citizenship 
centers, the centers provide free fingerprinting, photographing and counseling 
on how to fill out the N400 Application for Naturalization forms, in addition 
to the schooling at $10 per course. "We also hand-deliver all the forms to 
downtown," Gamez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsa Zamora, an adviser to the English as a Second Language and citizenship 
programs, said the only step of the process that has to be conducted at the INS 
office is the oral examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program's inception, the centers have helped about 8,000 immigrants 
become citizens. "Only four or five applications were not accepted," said 
Zamora, explaining that they were rejected because the photographs submitted 
were not in the proper format. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora said the school district goal is to help 50,000 of the estimated 90,000 
immigrants who will be turning in their green cards this year. 
</P>
<P>
 After four months of biweekly classes at the Van Nuys center, Macedonio 
Sanchez, 61, passed the application process and will be sworn in as a U. S. 
citizen Nov. 9. Sanchez said he had applied for citizenship in March, but 
failed the test because he had only studied four hours for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yelena Pelepis, originally from Odessa, Russia, said she is scared about 
taking the citizenship exam next month but said she has enjoyed her education 
at Van Nuys. She expressed concern about the mounting anti-immigrant sentiment 
she and her classmates have noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Americans are immigrants from a long, long time ago," Pelepis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an excellent service for the community. Otherwise, they'd have 
to pay $500 to fill out the application, fingerprinting and photos," said Van 
Nuys instructor Salvador Aragon, an immigrant from El Salvador who became a U. 
S. citizen three years ago. MAKI BECKER

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; IT'S HARDER TO BE 
SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an old trick, as Los Angeles Police Capt. Michael Melton points out, for 
a criminal to provide false identification to hide past dirty deeds or avoid 
starting a criminal file under their real name. 
</P>
<P>
 But Melton, who heads the Police Department's jail division, said high 
technology is rapidly closing the loop on real-time identifications, with 
systems such as AFIS, the Automated Fingerprint Identification System and a new 
LAPD computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with such sophisticated systems in place, some people still benefit 
from misidentification -- but not always the ones who expected to. 
</P>
<P>
 A Panorama City woman walked into the Van Nuys Jail about 10 p.m. Friday and 
asked a desk officer about the bail amount on her son, a 17-year-old who had 
been arrested by Van Nuys Division patrol officers on suspicion of selling 
drugs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was told that her son, who she identified as Manuel Alvarez, was being 
held at the Devonshire jail, Officer Clark Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The following morning, the woman walked into the station and forked over $250 
to secure her son's release. She was surprised by what happened next. 
</P>
<P>
 Out strolled Manuel Alvarez, but he wasn't her son. Only later did authorities 
discover that the woman believed that her son had given police that name 
instead of his real one -- and, by coincidence, there really was a Manuel 
Alvarez locked up when she appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom and a friend who was with her said, 'Hey, that's not my son,' " Baker 
said. "The lady wanted her money back, but there was nothing we could do for 
her. She came to bail out Manuel Alvarez and that's what she did." 
</P>
<P>
 The real Alvarez, apparently figuring out what happened, wasted no time 
hanging around either. 
</P>
<P>
 "He casually opened the front door and then it was exit stage right," Baker 
said of Alvarez, who had been jailed on suspicion of misdemeanor assault. "The 
last time we saw him was in the convex mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
 After the woman confessed that her son told her that Manuel Alvarez was the 
alias he gave to authorities, she said, "Why don't you try this one?" and gave 
authorities yet another alias that she said her son might also be using. 
</P>
<P>
 Using that name, police located her son on the computer: He was being held at 
the Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not uncommon for aliases or AKAs ("also known as," in police jargon) to 
backfire, Melton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the most common instance is someone calling and asking for so and so 
and they say, 'I know you have them in jail, because I saw them arrested.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But some suspects cover their tracks a little better than others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because inmates in city jails have unlimited access to telephones, they can 
contact loved ones and tell them about the "AKA for the day," which allows them 
to temporarily continue the charade, Melton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone lies every time, but some of them lie a lot of the time," Melton 
said. "There are people out there who have been arrested 15 times and used 15 
different names." 
</P>
<P>
 The department's newest tool, Live-Scan, won't eliminate the use of aliases to 
conceal a suspect's true identity, but it will tremendously speed up the time 
it takes to match the fingerprints of a newly arrested person with the vast 
fingerprint records on file with the department, Melton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, fingerprint information was taken by messenger from San Fernando 
Valley stations to Parker Center to be matched against other records. 
</P>
<P>
 Training classes are now being held to familiarize jail officers with the 
computers. All Valley stations have jails. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with the existing AFIS system, which is used by state, county and city 
law enforcement agencies, Live-Scan is going to make it a lot tougher in the 
future to use an alias and get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already pretty difficult," Melton said. "But it is soon going to be even 
more difficult because we won't have to wait for fingerprints to be physically 
transported from place to place." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Baker said he hopes that the distraught mother learned her 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 But the last time he saw her, Baker said, the woman was on her way to the 
house of the real Alvarez "to try to get the money back."

<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has allocated $908,259 to the city 
of San Fernando to help pay for damages caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake. The 
funds will be used to pay for damages to both commercial and residential 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the money, $108,000 has been set aside for the reconstruction of homes 
destroyed in the quake. These funds will be distributed through grants or 
loans. The maximum grant will be $5,000, and the maximum loan $20,000. Another 
$275,000 will be used to repair damaged homes; $250,000 will be used for the 
rehabilitation of commercial properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Damages for the January quake have been estimated at $2.3 billion, not 
including damage to federal and state properties, such as highways or bridges, 
which suffered an estimated $18 billion in damages. JAMES ELMENDORF

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; WORKERS RACE CLOCK TO REPAIR CSUN LIBRARY

<P>
 The workers scrambling around-the-clock to complete repairs to the 
quake-ravaged Oviatt Library at Cal State Northridge have no 
multimillion-dollar bonus speeding them toward an Aug. 15 target date. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospect of getting more than a million books back in circulation in 
time for the fall semester seems to be incentive enough. "The challenge and 
sense of mission these people share is really clear," university spokesman 
Bruce Erickson said. "They are going to do whatever it takes."

 Since the end of the spring semester, when a campus survey revealed that 
students and faculty wanted repairs to the Oviatt to be of highest priority, 
double and triple shifts of workers have toiled 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week, completing repairs to the building's core in a fraction of the time it 
would usually take. Gimmicks such as T-shirts inscribed with the number of 
remaining days, Mickey Mouse ears with a number on each ear and a cake marked 
with the correct number of candles remind the nearly 100 workers daily of the 
approaching deadline. Gimmicks aside, there's not much time for fooling around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have a really serious attitude here about keeping on schedule," said 
Doug Davis, associate dean of the library. "They're constantly doing everything 
they can to do things as fast as they can." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to repairing a section of the roof overhang that collapsed in the 
quake, workers are replacing ceiling tiles, installing carpet and repainting 
the interior. About half of the 1.1 million volumes in the library's collection 
ended up on the floor after the Jan. 17 quake and will eventually have to be 
reshelved. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials have set Aug. 26 as a preliminary date for a 
ribbon-cutting ceremony and expect major repair work to be completed by Aug. 15 
so that books can be shelved and furniture replaced before the reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we lost use of the Oviatt, it was the most crushing blow of the 
earthquake," Erickson said. "The library is the center point around which 
everything revolves." SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; DRIVER HELD AFTER 2 KILLED IN ACCIDENT

<P>
 A Van Nuys man who police say was driving drunk was booked on two counts of 
vehicular manslaughter Tuesday after he allegedly plowed into an oncoming car, 
killing the two occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Ramon Gonzalez, 46, ran a red light at Topham Street and Tampa 
Avenue in Tarzana around 12:40 a.m. and barreled into a Geo Metro on the 
opposite side of Topham. 
</P>
<P>
 The compact car was propelled more than 100 feet before Gonzalez's car turned 
and ran into a utility pole, Los Angeles Police Officer Steve Schiltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Hawkins, 45, and his wife, Mary Hawkins, 42, of Oxnard were pronounced 
dead on arrival at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and Encino-Tarzana 
Regional Medical Center, respectively, Schiltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Hawkins was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident but it was 
uncertain whether his wife was wearing one, Valley Traffic Detective Jim Mann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiltz said two witnesses first noticed Gonzalez driving "crazily" on Balboa 
Boulevard. They told officers that before the collision at Tampa, Gonzalez's 
Chevrolet Caprice sideswiped one car and collided with another on Balboa before 
speeding off toward Tampa. The witnesses then followed Gonzalez as he sped 
through intersections, often on the wrong side of the road, Schiltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the compact car was hit, Schiltz reported witnesses as saying that 
Gonzalez's sedan was traveling between 65 and 80 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "He reeked of the smell of alcoholic beverages," Schiltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez was being held in the jail ward at County-USC Medical Center in fair 
condition, police said. ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

 Three public works projects have been slated to begin in August in the Agoura 
Hills, Calabasas and west county areas, two of which will reduce traffic lanes 
during day work hours. All three projects will be administered by the County 
Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunt Road, between Schueren Road and Mulholland Highway, will be resurfaced 
by Boral Resources Inc. of Pomona for nearly $500,000. Construction is 
scheduled to be completed in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The reconstruction and resurfacing of Kanan Road from Agoura Road to Tunnel 
No. 3 in Agoura Hills will be conducted over the next year by Security Paving 
Co. Inc. of Sun Valley for $2.2 million. Traffic lanes may be closed during 
construction hours, but local access is expected to be maintained at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 To improve drainage and eliminate rodents and odors, Ilias Meikhail Joha, of 
Lancaster, was awarded a $73,000 contract to clean out 5,400 catch basins in 
the San Fernando Valley area of the city of Los Angeles, Westlake Village and 
neighboring unincorporated areas. Traffic will not be affected by this project, 
which will be complete in October. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PANAH MURDER TRIAL TO REMAIN IN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills man accused of kidnaping and murdering an 8-year-old girl 
will be tried in the San Fernando Valley, a judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert Sheahen asked Superior Court Judge Sandy Kriegler to 
move the capital murder trial of Hooman Ashkan Panah to a courtroom downtown or 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that the disappearance and slaying of Nicole Parker in November 
received extensive pretrial publicity, especially in the Valley, and that 
prospective jurors were tainted by news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, who lived near the child's father in a sprawling apartment complex on 
Ventura Boulevard, was charged with the child's murder after her body was found 
in a suitcase in his closet. Sheahen also argued that Lori Parker, the slain 
child's mother, works as a paralegal and is dating a well-known Valley 
attorney, giving her a "special relationship" with the Valley's courts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kriegler agreed with Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Berman that Panah, 22, could 
still receive a fair trial in Van Nuys Superior Court since the publicity has 
diminished since the Nov. 20 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The case returns to court Sept. 26 when other pretrial issues are likely to be 
raised. Among them: a motion by the defense to exclude a statement Panah made 
to police and a motion to exclude a blood-spattered notebook that was found in 
his car. The notebook contained an apology to the child's family but blames the 
killing on "evil, psychotic" people. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahen said he will seek to keep the jury from hearing Panah's statement, 
saying the suspect spoke to police after he was given Haldol, a powerful 
anti-psychotic medication, by an emergency room physician. The drug, 
administered to calm him, may have influenced his decision to speak with 
police, Sheahen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, who was indicted by a grand jury in February, has pleaded not guilty to 
seven counts, including murder, kidnaping and sodomy. Prosecutors have said 
they will seek the death penalty if he is convicted of first-degree murder. ANN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY GETS NEW AID FOR QUAKE REPAIRS

<P>
 The city of Calabasas will receive $1.34 million from the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors to help pay for the damages caused by the Northridge 
earthquake on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the aid, $1.09 million, has been set aside for grants or loans to 
repair both single- and multiple-family homes. The maximum amount allotted for 
each unit is $35,000. This funding is intended to be a last resort, and will be 
available only after all other funding sources have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is provided through a $7-million Community Development Block Grant. 
The funds are distributed by the Los Angeles County Community Development 
Commission. So far, the commission has distributed $24.7 million in 
earthquake-related funds. JAMES ELMENDORF

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; DISASTER-AID GRANT WILL HELP ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to help a group of people often overlooked after a disaster, the Los 
Angeles City Council accepted a $3.9-million federal grant Tuesday to help 
senior citizens recover from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be distributed to nonprofit organizations that already work 
with senior citizens, providing such services as transportation, legal aid and 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the community groups, working out of 15 senior citizens centers throughout 
the city, will also provide disaster aid such as minor home repair work, 
relocation assistance and help in applying for disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The council instructed the Department of Aging to return within 45 days with a 
report detailing how the department plans to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Smith, general manager of the department, said studies of other disasters, 
such as the Midwest floods and Florida's Hurricane Andrew, found that senior 
citizens were generally overlooked by local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seniors have special needs and no one really looked at those needs after 
those disasters," she said. "With these efforts, we are trying to address this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 For older residents, it is particularly difficult dealing with the stress of 
filling out complex disaster fund applications while fending off fraudulent 
contractors who prey on senior citizens, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The need appears to be significant. Between Jan. 17 and June 17, the 
Department of Aging provided services to 12,021 older people who lost homes or 
property in the quake, or who need emotional or financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant was welcome news to the Rev. Alicia Broadous-Duncan, who helps run a 
senior citizens counseling group at the Pacoima Senior Citizens Multipurpose 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are excited," she said. "We are ecstatic because the funds are really 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadous-Duncan said her counseling group trains senior citizens to counsel 
their peers because they can best understand the trauma other older people go 
through after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city was inundated with federal and state disaster assistance 
immediately after the quake, Broadous-Duncan said that help is diminishing, 
increasing the need for locally funded assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the quake, things leveled off and people didn't realize that they were 
still (emotionally) shaken," she said. "It's like being discombobulated." HUGO 
MARTIN

GRAFFITI INCIDENTS DECLINE BY ONE-THIRD IN 6-MONTH PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Graffiti incidents here have dropped by more than one-third during the first 
half of the year, compared with the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents reported 347 incidents of graffiti from January through June, down 
from 557 during the same six-month span last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been six months since the (Northridge) earthquake and we still don't 
see the incidents like we used to," said Kevin Tonoian, who coordinates the 
city of Santa Clarita's graffiti abatement efforts. "I think it's a combination 
of a lot of efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonoian credited work by Santa Clarita's Pride Committee, whose volunteers 
clean up graffiti, and prevention efforts by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, Santa Clarita Valley station, and the Santa Clarita Anti-Gang Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's report on graffiti wasn't the first time that city officials have 
learned of the local decline in graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of Santa Clarita's fourth annual Teen Spring Clean, held in May, 
struggled to find enough of the vandalism to keep dozens of volunteers busy for 
a few hours one Saturday morning. The participating youths ultimately spent 
much of the time planting trees along Soledad Canyon Road in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in May, the City Council was comfortable enough with anti-graffiti 
efforts to halve the cash awards offered for information about graffiti 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in April, 1993, the city program paid rewards in $250 increments 
for information about anyone writing graffiti in the city, up to a maximum of 
$1,000, if a suspect was ultimately convicted. Rewards are now $125 each to a 
maximum of $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the drop in graffiti, Tonoian said the city plans to continue its 
efforts to stop the vandalism in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always the possibility it could pick right back up," he said.

PROGRAM ADDS WORKPLACE TO CURRICULUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High school district and city officials have developed a new program aimed at 
teaching at-risk students work skills while at the same time earning class 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Student Partnership Program, created by William S. Hart Union High School 
District and Santa Clarita officials, is aimed at students who might otherwise 
drop out of school. It begins this fall and will run throughout the school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a great way to provide an introduction to students who wouldn't 
normally have an introduction to these businesses," said Rick Putnam, city 
director of parks, recreation and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will begin with 10 ninth-graders from each of Santa Clarita's four 
high schools and will expand to higher grades in future years. It will allow 
teen-agers who dislike traditional classes to attend two courses a day 
off-campus and then to participate in work projects or pursue career 
opportunities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family support is a major component of the program, organizers said. Students 
must commit to completing assigned work, and parents must agree to both support 
them and enroll in a parental education course. 
</P>
<P>
 For their work, students will receive a small stipend paid by the city and 
school district rather than the participating businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said that 25 to 35 Santa Clarita Valley firms are needed to provide 
work projects for the program and that several have already expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart district is providing instructors for the program, diverting $120,000 
in state attendance funds to cover the cost. The city will spend $50,000 
annually for transportation, stipends and equipment costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping students in the classroom is often a task left solely to school 
districts, but Santa Clarita officials say programs such as this avoid higher 
costs down the road for law enforcement, vandalism cleanup and imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 As Putnam noted, youths who misbehave in the classroom usually misbehave out 
of the classroom as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, we deal with the same kids," Putnam said. "Why not try a 
cooperative approach?"

CLUB PLANNING TO REOPEN WITHOUT EXOTIC DANCERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Valley's only exotic dance club, shut down by authorities 
last week because it lacked the necessary operating permits, may reopen Monday, 
but customers who show up to watch the female dancers will be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of Castaic Junction: A Gentleman's Club plans to operate the 
establishment as a restaurant and lounge -- without the exotic dancers -- until 
an entertainment permit is obtained from Los Angeles County, said Tracey Jones, 
the club's bookkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how long that will take," she said. "All I know is we're working 
on it as fast as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 A sign on the club's door asked customers to call a phone number for a 
recorded message about the club's reopening. That recording also said club 
operators plan to reopen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies closed the club Thursday -- less than a month after it 
opened -- when county investigators learned that it did not have the proper 
food or entertainment permits. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation into the club, located just north of Six Flags Magic 
Mountain, was sparked by a complaint from a resident, said Dwight Andersen, 
assistant division manager for the county's Department of Treasurer-Tax 
Collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Club owner Stuart Cadwell applied for a license to serve food in mid-June, but 
several county agencies must give their approval before it is issued, Andersen 
said. There is no average approval time for food licenses, and he does not know 
if Cadwell's license will be approved by Monday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were caught off guard when they visited the club and learned 
about the dancers, since Cadwell had indicated that he was simply opening a 
restaurant, Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cadwell applied for an entertainment permit in mid-July. Andersen said 
processing that permit will probably require one to two months and will include 
a public hearing, which has not yet been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy has surrounded the club since its June 30 opening, when it 
featured nude dancing in an alcohol-free environment. The Newhall Land & 
Farming Co., which owns the building, went to court and obtained a restraining 
order the next day that forces the dancers to wear bikinis. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land officials claimed in court that the establishment violated its 
lease and that an exotic dance club was inappropriate for a family-oriented 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of complaints have poured into Newhall Land and county officials since 
the club's opening.

WITNESS WEDS MAN ACCUSED IN SHOOTING; VENTURA COUNTY: MARCIE JAMES STUNS 
PROSECUTORS IN TESTIFYING THAT SHE MARRIED NEWBURY PARK HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL 
STAR LEODES VAN BUREN ON JULY 8.

<P>
 The key witness against a football star accused of shooting up a Newbury Park 
house in April stunned prosecutors Tuesday by testifying that she is now the 
defendant's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcie James, 20, told a Ventura County Superior Court jury that she wed 
Newbury Park High School football star Leodes Van Buren in Las Vegas on July 8 
-- three months to the day after he allegedly fired a bullet through her back 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me about 15 seconds to collect my wits," Deputy Dist. Atty. James 
Grunert said after the disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 James said she married Van Buren in an attempt to regain custody of the 
couple's 2-year-old daughter. She said she granted her parents legal custody 
immediately after the girl was born to make the child eligible for the 
grandparents' health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, a 19-year-old standout wide receiver, planned to attend the 
University of Colorado on a football scholarship this fall. But since the 
shooting, the university has said he is not academically eligible, and Van 
Buren has said he wants out of the letter of intent he signed with the school. 
</P>
<P>
 James was the first witness Tuesday when Van Buren went on trial on a felony 
charge of shooting at an occupied dwelling. No one was hurt in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the April 8 attack, she testified, she told her parents and 
police that Van Buren had fired the gun through the back door. She said he was 
angry that she would not let him inside to discuss their breakup the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 But in police interviews and court testimony since then, James has given 
differing accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 9, James testified Tuesday, she told her parents and investigators 
that another man, one she had never seen before, actually fired the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in an interview with investigators May 4, James changed her story again, 
she acknowledged Tuesday. This time, she told police that Van Buren acted alone 
and that he had threatened her life and the lives of her family members since 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 At the preliminary hearing in Municipal Court on May 26, James again reversed 
her statements, insisting that Van Buren did not fire at the Newbury Park home. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tuesday, she testified that a companion of the defendant had fired at the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't have said Leodes did it, but I did," James told the jury, adding 
that she had been angry with the defendant for cheating on her. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney John B. Miller of Woodland Hills said he knew a week ago 
about his client's wedding. But he said he decided not to assert the 
defendant's right not to have his wife testify against him. To do so, he said, 
might suggest that James was hiding something. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have backfired," Miller said. "We're going on the facts (of the 
shooting), not on the fact they were married." 
</P>
<P>
 Grunert said that because all of the incidents surrounding the case occurred 
before the wedding, the testimony would be allowed in any case. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of the shooting, Ventura County sheriff's deputies arrested Van 
Buren at his home while he was on the phone confessing the crime to an 
emergency 911 dispatcher, Grunert said in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor plans to call the dispatcher to the witness stand today.

ARTIST WOOD, 101, TO LEAVE HOSPITAL SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Renowned ceramist Beatrice Wood is recovering from surgery at a Los Angeles 
hospital and is expected to return to her Ojai retreat sometime this week, her 
manager said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, 101, entered the hospital three weeks ago when she contracted 
bronchitis, which deteriorated into pneumonia, said Ram Singh, Wood's manager 
and personal assistant for the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Once her pneumonia had improved, doctors discovered a bleeding ulcer and kept 
her in the hospital for surgery, Singh said. He requested that the name of the 
hospital be kept private so that the famed artist can rest with no disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 She is expected to return to her Ojai studio this week, probably by Friday, 
Singh said. Wood will continue her recovery there for about a month before 
returning to work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is doing quite well," Singh said. "She's a tough lady. The doctors 
couldn't believe she's 101 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood's clay pieces have been acclaimed in the international art world for 
their whimsy and craft. Her ceramics are displayed in the permanent collections 
of 12 major U.S. museums, including the Smithsonian and New York's Metropolitan 
Museum, as well as at museums around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Her pieces range from lusterware goblets and fiery glazed dishes to funny, 
folk-artsy figures. One piece called "Modern Woman," created in 1991, depicts a 
female hoisting a male over her head. She also has created miniature bordellos 
out of clay. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she fell ill, Wood was creating up to a dozen new pieces each month, 
Singh said. She can't wait to get back to her studio and start creating more, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She keeps telling the doctors: 'Let me go home. I have so many ideas in my 
head that I need to turn into clay and stone,' " Singh said. KAY SAILLANT

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: YOUR MONEY; NEW MORTGAGES MIGHT NOT BE 
BEST WAY TO SAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A new breed of mortgages burst on the national scene Tuesday after the Federal 
National Mortgage Assn. gave its all-important blessing to the so-called Asset 
Integrated Mortgage -- AIM for short -- which promises to help you save while 
you pay off your mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 AIM, which will initially be offered in 50 U.S. metropolitan areas, including 
Los Angeles and Orange counties, is one of several new hybrid mortgages that 
combine home loans with investments. A similar product, called the Money Back 
Home Loan, was recently launched in California. More than a dozen lenders are 
test-marketing similar hybrids. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannie Mae's approval of the AIM loan is likely to touch off a major push for 
these mortgages as banks struggle to boost loan demand in today's 
rising-interest-rate environment. Fannie Mae is important because it buys the 
loans from bankers, giving the banks cash to make more loans. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumers need to be wary. The loans are highly complex because they 
entwine your mortgage with an insurance product. You have to examine the terms 
of both the mortgage and the insurance "investment" to determine whether 
they're a good deal. Often they're not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing these products have going for them is that they provide forced 
savings once you commit to them," says David Hemstreet, a Pasadena-based 
financial planner. That's valuable if you would not otherwise have the 
discipline to save. But if you're savvy and disciplined, you can probably do 
better on your own, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at two of the recently introduced products -- the AIM loan created by 
Financial Integration in Cleveland and the Money Back Home Loan, introduced by 
Investment Mortgage Corp. in Atlanta -- illustrates why. 
</P>
<P>
 The AIM product works this way: You put 5% down on the house and put the other 
15% that you would normally need for a 20% down payment into an insurance 
annuity, which is pledged as security for your loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming you don't default and that you keep the loan and insurance annuity 
for the full 30-year term, you will have paid off your house and will have an 
annuity worth at least your original mortgage amount at the end of the period, 
AIM promoters say. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because you've used a substantial portion of your down payment on an 
insurance annuity, you've got a larger home loan -- and bigger monthly 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming you're buying a $100,000 home, you would pay $730.47 a month on a 
$95,000 loan at an 8.5% fixed interest rate, says Dennis Godfrey, director of 
new product development at Fannie Mae. If you went with a traditional loan 
program -- with a 20% down payment -- you'd pay $615.13 monthly, or about $115 
a month less, Godfrey says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still sounds attractive? Consider what would happen instead if you put the 20% 
down on the house and invested the $115 a month difference -- the $730 monthly 
cost of AIM minus the $615 monthly you'd pay on a traditional mortgage -- in 
your 401(k) plan, which gives tax benefits similar to those of the annuity. 
Assuming you earn 6% on your investments, you would have accumulated more than 
$115,000 at the end of 30 years -- $20,000 more than AIM promises. 
</P>
<P>
 There's another catch. AIM doesn't guarantee that you'll have $95,000 saved in 
30 years. It estimates you'll have that much, based on the assumption that 
you'll earn at least 6% annually on your $15,000 investment in the insurance 
annuity. The "guaranteed rate" -- the amount you'll earn regardless of market 
conditions -- is just 4%. If you earn only 4% on your $15,000, your nest egg 
will be worth less than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, if you want to get rid of the insurance policy early, you may 
have to refinance the home. The policy and the loan are separate, says Godfrey, 
but because the policy secures the loan, you'd have to kick in cash, refinance 
or prove you built up more than 20% equity in the home to let the policy lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Money Back Home Loan presents an even more troubling worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 With this loan, you make the traditional 20% down payment. But your monthly 
payments don't pay down principal: They pay interest on your loan balance and 
they buy an insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming you buy a $100,000 home and make the obligatory 20% down payment, 
you'd pay $566.67 on an interest-only 8.5% loan, says Godfrey. Then you add the 
cost of the insurance policy, which in this case would be roughly $83 a month. 
In total, the Money Back loan would cost $650 a month, compared to $615 for a 
traditional loan. 
</P>
<P>
 If the $83 you pay each month to the insurer earns an average of 8% annually, 
you'll have $123,700 accumulated in the policy at the end of the term. You 
"borrow" out $80,000 to pay off your loan -- you avoid tax penalties by 
borrowing against the policy rather than cashing it in -- and have $43,700 
left. And all for just $35 extra a month. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if your insurance policy pays just the guaranteed rate of 4%? You 
have only $57,606 accumulated in 30 years. And you still owe $80,000 on your 
mortgage. An ugly prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the issue of alternatives. What happens if you get the 
traditional mortgage and invest the $35 difference in your 401(k) plan at an 
average annual return of 8%? In addition to a paid-off mortgage, you have 
$52,162 at the end of 30 years -- or $8,462 more than you'd have with the 
comparable Money Back loan option. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a buyer-beware sort of deal," says Margie Mullen, a Los 
Angeles-based fee-only financial planner. If you don't need to be threatened 
with losing your house to inspire you to save, she says there are better 
options.

VALLEY BRIEFING: DUMP DEBATE; CITY, COUNTY CLASH AT SUNSHINE CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where to put a city's trash is a tricky question. No one wants to live next to 
a garbage dump. Los Angeles County residents produce more than 50,000 tons of 
trash every day -- 20,000 tons more per day than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the same 20-year period, the number of major public landfills open to 
take that trash has dwindled from 16 to eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Battles over landfills across the county have been bitter affairs, often 
pitting residents against local officials and dump operators. Over the past 10 
years, just such a fight has been waged in the northern San Fernando Valley 
over the future of Sunshine Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants us to pick up their trash on trash day. The problem is that 
no one wants us to put it down again. We can't just drive around with it all 
day. . . . Like it or not, landfilling is the best technology available today." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arnie Berghoff, spokesman for Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunshine Canyon represents an almost unique oak woodlands conifer forest in 
Southern California. Although many of the trees have come down, much of the 
forest is left. For that reason, tearing it down for the purpose of putting 
trash in it is almost an obscenity." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rosemary Woodlock, attorney for the North Valley Coalition of Concerned 
Citizens WHAT'S AT STAKE 
</P>
<P>
 Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., one of the country's largest waste-management 
companies, has permission from Los Angeles County to expand its now-closed 
garbage dump in a sensitive oak woodland north of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The dump site straddles the line between Los Angeles city and county, but the 
expansion would take place only on county territory. The city portion of the 
dump, opened in 1954, has been closed since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the county portion has been delayed due to various court challenges by 
dump opponents. If it is ultimately allowed to open, the dump will accept as 
much as 6,000 tons of trash per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents as well as Los Angeles city officials say the landfill should 
not reopen. Opponents say that when the dump was in operation they were 
inundated with wind-blown bits of trash and dust. They also fear that if the 
dump is reopened, it could threaten the city's water supply at Van Norman 
Reservoir, about two miles southeast of the dump. ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill opponents argue that alternatives to dumping in nearby canyons should 
be pursued. Trash can be burned in clean-burning incinerators, but proposals to 
build such facilities have been killed by protests from neighbors and 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals to haul trash by rail to remote locations have gained popularity in 
recent years, but costs are extremely high and some environmentalists argue 
that it simply fouls new areas. TURF WARS 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the landfill ultimately gets built, trucks from the city of Los 
Angeles may be prohibited from dumping there. Because city officials refused to 
allow the dump to expand, county officials retaliated by imposing a condition 
that trucks carrying city trash could dump at the site for just 18 months. 
After that, they would be excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, city officials argue that Browning-Ferris needs a special city permit to 
use an internal road to get to the county portion of the dump. County officials 
and Browning-Ferris dispute the city's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city agrees to drop its legal challenges to the project, it may be 
permitted to dump its trash at Sunshine Canyon. A CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS 
</P>
<P>
 1954: Sunshine Canyon Landfill opens. 
</P>
<P>
 1975: Browning-Ferris takes over the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 1984: Browning-Ferris proposes to expand the landfill's capacity by 70 million 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
 February, 1991: The Board of Supervisors scales back the plan to 17 million 
tons and approves the expansion. The city and a coalition of neighborhood 
groups sue to overturn the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 September, 1991: The City Council refuses to renew the dump's operating 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 March, 1992: A judge rules that Browning-Ferris should have included 
information about past health and zoning violations at the dump in its 
environmental documentation and orders the county to have environmental experts 
review the project. 
</P>
<P>
 July, 1992: Supervisors again approve the project and opponents again take the 
issue to court. 
</P>
<P>
 October, 1992: A judge again refuses to allow the project to move forward, 
saying the public did not have adequate time to review new information provided 
by Browning-Ferris and the county. 
</P>
<P>
 November, 1993: The Board of Supervisors approves the project for a third 
time. Opponents again file legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 June, 1994: A county oversight committee allows construction to begin, but a 
judge halts it days later so she can review the objections of opponents. A 
hearing on whether to extend the work stoppage is scheduled for Aug. 4. 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 
</P>
<P>
 The dump would cover 215 acres. Construction will require the removal of 2,850 
oak trees, but Browning-Ferris is required to replace those on a 2-to-1 basis. 
The company will also dedicate 950 acres for use as parkland.
