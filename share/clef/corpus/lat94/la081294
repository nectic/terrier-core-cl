THEATER REVIEW; A SEARCH FOR TRUTH IN BEAUTY; 'THE WAITING ROOM' TAKES A 
DISTURBING LOOK AT SOCIETY'S VIEW OF ATTRACTIVENESS

 In "The Waiting Room," Lisa Loomer's fascinating new play at the Mark Taper 
Forum, three women await medical attention in a sleek modern office where time 
has been erased. There's Forgiveness From Heaven, a Chinese woman whose toe has 
fallen off due to a foot binding; Victoria, a corseted Victorian seeking 
ovariotomy to cure a disease called hysteria; and Wanda, a sassy blonde party 
girl with the timing of a stand-up comic and industrial-size breasts, thanks to 
the magic of silicone. Wanda's implants need adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 Part activist, part sitcom writer, Loomer creates a recognizable world that 
nevertheless defies rational explanation in this smart and disturbing comedy. 
Why would different cultures eroticize the hobbling of women or the corseting 
of women? And why would our culture instill impossible standards of beauty that 
keep women in a lifelong state of inadequacy? 
</P>
<P>
 As a society we now have some understanding of the economic and hierarchical 
forces that drive this engine, thanks to writers from Thorstein Veblen to Naomi 
Wolf. Loomer reminds us of our own, current, neatly accepted explanations -- at 
one point, an angry woman at a bar spews the familiar anti-male diatribe, which 
everyone totally ignores -- and then the playwright asks us to look again at 
what we do to ourselves without thinking. Loomer provides a new lens on the 
subject through her great gift for absurdist humor, even as she shifts the 
burden of evil from men in general to a male-dominated medical and 
pharmaceutical industry. And although she is capable of lecturing, Loomer is 
never shrill. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, each of the characters is horrified by the other's cultural 
practices, and each finds her own as natural as breathing, as do the men who 
help perpetrate them. A Victorian husband (Simon Templeman) believes that 
ovariotomy will cure his high-strung wife, whose desire to learn Greek is 
considered one of her symptoms. But when he tells her, "I would never let 
anyone hurt you," he means it with all his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 In the play's most riveting scene, a brilliant ode to the line between 
pleasure and pain, Forgiveness (June Kyoko Lu) receives her husband (Jim 
Ishida) after a trip from which he's brought her silks, spices, his new 
11-year-old wife for her to hobble and, most important of all, opium. He 
unwraps her feet -- which stink so from infection that they cause a servant to 
hurl in the next room -- as if they were the key to every human erotic impulse. 
Forgiveness, too, is in raptures. Here Loomer the playwright takes over 
completely from Loomer the thinker, and the characters' motivations escape 
irresistibly into the mystery of sexuality.  
</P>
<P>
 Wanda is perhaps the most disturbing character of all. In a stunning 
performance by Jacalyn O'Shaughnessy, this is a Holly Golightly who's had her 
cheeks done, as well as her nose, her jaw and her breasts (three times), and 
yet who has some basic grasp of feminist thinking. Wanda has as much will to 
stop herself from the surgical pursuit of beauty as most women have to stop 
applying makeup in the morning. The line between pleasing the opposite sex and 
pleasing ourselves is as difficult to distinguish as the toxins in the air we 
breathe, and about as dangerous. Still. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Both Anne Militello's lighting and Mark Wendland's antiseptic set manage to be 
witty; they create a world where doctors' diplomas are eerily lit from within, 
and shiny white surfaces can transform from a Chinese love nest to a steam bath 
to a hospital room. David Schweizer directs with equal parts energy and brains, 
compassion and humor. He gets terrific performances all around; even in the 
non-speaking roles (Jason Reed is a hilarious dancing orderly).  
</P>
<P>
 A Buck Henry look-alike, Robert Picardo progresses impressively from just 
another callous doctor to one who faces his complicity in an American industry 
that prizes profits over health. Kurt Fuller is funny as a businessman with 
ties to the pharmaceutical industry and whose "listening exercises" can't 
disguise that he's a complete pig; Tony Simotes is a moronic FDA agent who 
looks up to him.  
</P>
<P>
 The women plunge into their roles to dismantle any cliches we might attach to 
their characters. Lela Ivey has a wonderful Billie Burke-ish vocal edge as the 
nervous Victoria, and a peculiar spasm every time she mentions the word husband 
. I could not stop watching June Kyoko Lu as Forgiveness, particularly when her 
insane subservience breaks into fury at the David Letterman show for not doing 
"Stupid Pet Tricks." Leah Maddrie plays a number of roles well, including the 
nurse Brenda, Loomer's mouthpiece for statistics and for a direct indictment of 
the American medical industry that the play probably could have done without. 
But even in such scenes, Loomer's passion abounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Once she is shorn of her ornamentation, Wanda finally assimilates the truth 
about herself and her culture that she suspected all along. Looking at a book 
of fairy tales, she concludes: "If you're old and ugly, you're screwed." When 
she and Loomer take a moment to envision the possibility that it could all be 
otherwise, "The Waiting Room" glows with that possibility. And it's Loomer's 
gift that she elucidates just what women really are waiting for -- a beautiful 
sense of self that has nothing to do with magazine ads and is something no 
surgeon can remove.

'90S LOVE STORY LOCKED IN THE '50S; MOVIE REVIEW: 'CORRINA, CORRINA,' WITH 
WHOOPI GOLDBERG AND RAY LIOTTA, IS WELL-MEANING, BUT ITS PORTRAIT OF THE RACES 
KEEPS THEM APART RATHER THAN TOGETHER. 
</P>

<P>
 In "Corrina, Corrina," 7-year-old Molly Singer (Tina Majorino) reacts to the 
death of her mother by becoming mute. Her father, Manny (Ray Liotta), has to 
hold down a job writing jingles for an ad agency so he interviews for a 
housekeeper and, after the usual comic mishaps, ends up with the distinctly 
overqualified Corrina Washington (Whoopi Goldberg). It's a foregone conclusion 
that Corrina will get the girl to speak again, just as it's inevitable that 
Manny and Corrina will become attracted to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, just about everything in this heartfelt plodder is predictable. 
First-time writer-director Jessie Nelson serves up vintage cliches in a '50s 
setting -- the dullness seems to be part of the period decor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a welcome moment early on when Molly begins talking again -- partly 
because her protracted muteness becomes rapidly annoying -- but you kind of 
wish some of the other characters would shut up. As Manny's mother, Erica Yohn 
really overdoes the yenta stuff. (The late Don Ameche, in his last, brief 
appearance, plays her husband. He's mute too.) A prospective mate of Manny's 
(Wendy Crewson) is broadly caricatured as an on-the-make huntress. Corrina's 
sister, Jevina (Jenifer Lewis), is forever going on about how Corrina should 
settle down with the nice suitor across the street (Steven Williams) and forget 
about getting close to her white boss. But we know better. When Corrina -- who 
has a college degree in musicology -- helps Manny out of a rut on a jingle for 
Jell-O, their soulmate status is secured. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the heartfeltness is Molly's wish for Corrina and her father 
to pair up. She's a pint-sized matchmaker who sees nothing odd in the pairing. 
(Her child's wisdom is supposed to shame our misgivings.) But even though 
Nelson takes a very "understanding" view of the interracial involvements, she 
points up the disparities between black and white so often that she never lets 
you forget them. 
</P>
<P>
 She cross-cuts between life at the Singer household and life with Jevina's 
large family, where Corrina also lives. The cross-referencing serves to keep 
these worlds apart rather than bring them together. And there's an 
embarrassing, misguided scene when Molly sings with Jevina's kids in the church 
choir, and they trade racial barbs without comprehending the force of what 
they're saying. (The scene is misguided because it's treated as a lickety-split 
learning experience; there's no pain in it.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the '50s period flavor is constantly reinforced, Corrina is more 
like a figure from the '90s. She makes no attempt to "fit into" the white 
world, and her standard-bearer stance seems a bit too self-righteous. Corrina 
comes across as archetypal anomaly; she's in the movie to bring Manny, the 
grieving atheist, to his senses and get him to talk to God. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldberg is at her best when she's not being noble and edifying. She's 
been excellent in the movies for years, ranging from "The Long Walk Home," in 
which she also played a maid, to "Soapdish" and "The Player." Her comic timing 
was the only reason to check out "Made in America" and "Sister Act 2." In 
"Corrina, Corrina" she's best in the brief scenes in which she's dilly-dallying 
with Molly -- when she's not trying to massage our social consciousness. In the 
scenes with Ray Liotta, who seems gamefully miscast, all we get is massage. 
</P>
<P>
 The two liveliest actors in the movie are not the leads. As the dingbat 
housekeeper who has a brief run with the Singers, Joan Cusack is marvelous, as 
usual. (Why isn't she getting bigger roles?) And, as Percy, one of Jevina's 
kids, little Curtis Williams steals every scene he's in. You get the feeling he 
could steal from the best.

 A New Dice Roll?: Comedian Andrew Dice Clay is apparently shelving his raunchy 
"Diceman" persona in favor of a co-starring role on the upcoming midseason 
replacement NBC series, "The Ties That Bind." Clay, whose foul "Diceman" 
character brought him attention in the comedy world but has hindered previous 
TV projects, "will not be anything remotely like the 'Diceman' character" on 
the TV show, which stars Ralph Macchio as a young husband and father, producer 
Peter Noah told The Times. "He is not going to look the same, and he won't act 
the same. This character was written and designed before (Clay) was even 
mentioned, and his billing on the show will just be Andrew Clay," Noah said. "I 
think one of the things that intrigued Andrew about doing this was the 
opportunity to show that there is something more to him than his 'Diceman' 
persona." Clay will play Macchio's single, working-class brother.

 'The Piano Lesson' Plays: August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, "The 
Piano Lesson," will be produced as a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation for 
broadcast on CBS. The production, which is being adapted for television by 
Wilson, will star Charles S. Dutton, Alfre Woodard, Rocky Carroll, Carl Gordon 
and Courtney B. Vance. Lloyd Richards will direct. The presentation reunites 
Dutton, Carroll and Gordon, who appeared together in the play (seen at L.A.'s 
Doolittle Theatre in 1990), before starring together in the just-canceled Fox 
comedy "Roc."

 Staying on the Runways: Despite lackluster ratings, Fox has shown faith in 
Aaron Spelling's latest series "Models Inc.," ordering an additional nine 
episodes of the "Melrose Place" spinoff dealing with a crop of top L.A. models. 
That brings the total order to 22. Fox on Thursday praised the show's ratings 
performance, noting it has doubled the marks brought in by "Melrose" repeats in 
the same time slot last summer. However, the series -- offering original 
programs in competition with many reruns -- has consistently landed fairly low 
on the ratings chart, such as last week when it tied for 56th place.

 Warner Bros. Fare: A new comedy series starring Robert Townsend, and a 
serialized comedy from producers Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas ("Soap," "The 
Golden Girls," "Empty Nest") are the latest additions announced for the nascent 
WB Television Network. The Townsend vehicle, tentatively titled "Father Knows 
Nothing," is described as a " 'Cosby Show' for the '90s" about "a 
well-intentioned dad" heading a "typically dysfunctional household." The 
Witt-Thomas serial, called "Muscle," is set in a New York fitness club, "where 
getting in shape and romantic intrigue go hand-in-hand." The new network debuts 
in January. LEGAL FILE

 Another Jackson Suit: A porcelain statue maker is suing Jackson family member 
Jermaine Jackson, claiming that he never paid for the trophies used in last 
February's "Jackson Family Honors" TV special. According to the New Jersey 
lawsuit, Jackson and his Jackson Communications Inc., which produced the show, 
made a $6,250-deposit to Boehm Studios for two diamond-studded trophies but 
never paid a $12,000-balance. At least one additional lawsuit has been filed in 
conjunction with the Jackson special.

 Another Tony Run-In: Comedian Jackie Mason, who earlier this year returned a 
previous Tony because he was not invited to appear on the June awards show, has 
sued six theater groups that administer the prestigious annual theatrical

rights were violated when his one-man show, "Politically Incorrect," was not 
considered for a Tony nomination. Mason continues to star in "Politically

as "scintillating and sensual dance," the program includes two dozen dances to 
such pop tunes as "Unforgettable," "Heartbreak Hotel," "Georgia on My Mind" and 
"When You Wish Upon a Star." And thrown in for the purists: Prokofiev's "Romeo

 Protest Letter: Seven photography experts who had recommended three grants 
that were overturned last week by a group of presidentially appointed National 
Endowment for the Arts overseers have charged the National Council on the Arts 
with using political criteria rather than artistic judgments to make the 
decision. Legislation that established the NEA in 1966 specifically prohibits 
that practice. The grant panel's unanimous, blistering letter lambastes the 
council's action as "politically expedient, procedurally unfair and 
artistically unconscionable." QUICK TAKES

MOVIE REVIEW; 'IN THE ARMY NOW' AN AMIABLE RETREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's not a whole lot to be said about "In the Army Now" or its star, Pauly 
Shore. If Shore's comic genius eludes you or if you find the film something 
less than a constant laugh riot, you may still be willing to agree that it's 
amiable enough and not begrudge in the least the likelihood that Shore fans 
will be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a service comedy, reminiscent of many others -- Bill Murray's funnier and 
more inspired "Stripes" is the first to come to mind. Shore and his sidekick 
(Andy Dick) are goofy guys trying hard to be cool but wind up signing up with 
the Army Reserve when they're fired from their video store jobs. They opt for 
the water purification team, believing it to be a safe choice, only to find 
themselves charged with destroying a Libyan Scud base hidden in a desert in 
Chad. 
</P>
<P>
 Shore, who first scored on MTV, is pleasant-looking and disciplined. His sense 
of timing is well-honed and his delivery droll -- there's a childlike quality 
to his way of speaking that finds you imagining him doing a scene with 
sound-alike Melanie Griffith. Like other comedians in the film -- Christine 
Jones and Fred Ostroff in particular as his water purification teammates -- 
Shore can draw laughs even in these fairly uninspired circumstances -- witness 
his miming a trip to the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight writers, including the film's director Daniel Petrie Jr., haven't 
freshened up very much a plot that's been around since the silent era. Petrie, 
however, compensates with consistently brisk, crisp direction; there's a 
refreshing lack of self-indulgence throughout. Even if you're not particularly 
amused by "In the Army Now," you may agree with one admirer who summed it up as 
"a nice, clean job." 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; LIVELY COMING-OF-AGE STORY IN 'MODE' WORLD OF PARIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A la Mode," which marks a winning feature debut for French writer-director 
Remy Duchemin, is a warm, funny and inspired coming-of-age comedy set in an old 
Jewish quarter of Paris during the '60s. Our hero, bright, skinny 17-year-old 
Fausto (Ken Higelin), lives in a vast old orphanage, but his prospects are 
about to brighten considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because it's time for Fausto to learn a trade, and he has the good 
fortune to be apprenticed to Mietek Breslauer (Jean Yanne), a stocky, 
apparently widowed Jewish tailor who takes great pride in his craft (and in 
driving a hard deal). Breslauer is a stern taskmaster but even more, he's a 
loving father figure. Consequently, when Fausto declares that he'd rather 
design dresses for women, Breslauer is prepared to go along with him. "A la 
Mode" is especially effective in capturing the exhilaration of Fausto's 
self-discovery; he really has the talent and skill to make it as a couturier , 
and his imagination coincides perfectly with the Mod styles of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniably, "A la Mode" is sentimental, but it's so affectionate, so 
overflowing with good cheer that its sunny spirit is endearing. Fausto and his 
burly best pal Raymond (Francois Hautesserre), who's a regular Le Petomane , 
engage in many teen-age shenanigans, and Fausto begins to discover true love in 
the form of the nearby mechanic's daughter Tonie (Florence Darel), who's as 
self-confident as she is beautiful, an ideal model for his creations.

 Duchemin, a veteran assistant director, and his co-writer Richard Morgieve 
eschew the usual sizable obstacles along Fausto's path to success and 
happiness. They're able to get away with this in part because they've dared to 
open the film on a dire note that has the effect of getting life's unavoidable 
losses out of the way right at the start; its effect is to leave us with the 
feeling that Fausto is thereafter entitled to as smooth a path as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchemin would seem really to care for actors, for they certainly glow under 
his direction. His young people couldn't be more ingratiating, but for the 
longtime fan of French films, "A la Mode's" key pleasure is in seeing the 
veteran Yanne get a change of pace. Having first come to the attention of 
American audiences in the title role of Claude Chabrol's "This Man Must Die" 
(1969) and more recently seen as the world-weary, sinister police chief of 
Saigon in "Indochine," Yanne is cast invariably in serious or malevolent roles. 
The proud, amusing Mietek allows Yanne to reveal that he's as skilled at being 
comical as he is in playing heavies.

THEATER BEAT: INTENSE 'STUMPS' CRACKLES AT ODYSSEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If evil could take human form today, it would probably look a lot like Calvin 
Rhodes, the ex-priest turned pornographer who taunts two disabled Vietnam vets 
with their own grandiose aspirations in the West Coast premiere of Mark 
Medoff's intense psychological drama "Stumps." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with sociopathic cunning and an unerring instinct for exploitable 
weakness, "Pastor" Rhodes (Gregg Henry, in a searing portrayal) brings a little 
bit of hell on Earth to Stephen (Joseph Adams), the one-handed proprietor of a 
small-town X-rated movie house, and his wheelchair-bound partner Jerry (Joe 
Maruzzo). 
</P>
<P>
 The two believe Jerry's arty erotic screenplay is their ticket to the good 
life, despite the moralistic cautions of Stephen's wife, Lin (Patty Toy), a 
troubled Vietnamese refugee. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Rhodes, a successful adult film producer, with his abused porn star 
girlfriend (Alix Koromzay) in tow, promising the wanna-be film moguls a life of 
"diverse gluttony" if they'll let him make the movie his way -- stripped of its 
lofty artistic ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gratification at the expense of values becomes the bait in this compelling 
work (set, appropriately enough, in the inaugural dawn of the Reagan era). 
</P>
<P>
 Starting out at a polite, almost leisurely pace, Allan Miller's assured 
direction draws the coils of Rhodes' stranglehold tauter and tauter around the 
seamless Odyssey Theatre Ensemble cast. A few implausible logistics used to 
engineer some private conversations are the only quibbles in a script that 
crackles with high-stakes confrontation. 
</P>

 * "Stumps," Odyssey Theatre, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West Los Angeles. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m., except for Sundays Aug. 21 and

THEATER BEAT: 'CUCKOLD!' SUFFERS AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moliere, meet Moe, Larry and Curly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuckold!," at the Knightsbridge Theater in Pasadena, is a double bill of 
featherweight one-acts ("Scanarelle, the Imaginary Cuckold" and "The Forced 
Marriage") by the 17th-Century French master. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plays were written with different sets of characters, director 
Ron Campbell has married them into one not-so-seamless narrative about a 
village idiot named Scanarelle (Morgan Rusler), who fears being cuckolded by 
his wife, Martine (Susan Kelejian). 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell likens the production to commedia dell'arte, though somehow the arte 
gets buried under piles and piles of the lowest commedia. The actors mug, 
shriek, prance, grab their privates and clobber one another with slapstick, 
almost as if they believed the texts would not play funny enough without a 
tidal wave of ad-libs. Lest anyone miss out on the laugh riot, a drummer 
helpfully punctuates the comic gems with rim shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in this mess is any sensitivity to Moliere's language, including the 
wicked rhymed couplets that made him justifiably famous. 
</P>
<P>
 May we please send back the clowns? 
</P>
<P>
 * "Cuckold!," Knightsbridge Theater, 35 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena. Saturdays 8 
p.m., Sundays 5 p.m. Ends Aug. 28. (818) 440-0821. $15. Running time: 1 hour

THEATER BEAT: ANGELS' 'NEON TETRA' TAKES AIM AT ICONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Handily living up to its satirical premise about a housewife's transformation 
into a lip-syncing phenom, Sebastian Stuart's "Neon Tetra" at Angels Theater 
takes short, biting jabs at all sorts of trendy jugulars -- and usually 
connects with hilarious accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Reed engagingly carries the title role through the stock stages of 
stardom -- from shy ingenue to blossoming artist to uptight prima donna to 
pathetic has-been 20 years in the future, and Kevin Williamson plays her nerdy 
true love with impeccable whining conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, we can't help reveling in Stuart's delightfully catty potshots 
at cultural icons (like the inspired rock video of the "I Dream of Jeannie" 
theme with lyrics by existential chanteuse Suzanne Vega) in a society that 
elevates pretense to an art form. Despite Alexa Hunter's crisp direction, 
however, a few scenes overstay their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Is "Neon Tetra" worth seeing? As one of Stuart's 21st-Century teeny-boppers 
would say in future-slang for self-evidence, "Well, duh -- is Kevin Costner 
President?" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Neon Tetra," Angels Theater, 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake. Fridays, 
Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Aug. 27. $10. (213) 466-1767. Running

THEATER BEAT: BURBAGE ENSEMBLE ILLUMINATES 'RACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With "Race," the Burbage Theatre Ensemble has found an ingenious and 
illuminating way to look at the vexing, endlessly complicated subject of 
American race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago playwright Jamie Pachino has adapted the interviews of Studs Terkel's 
recent book "Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American 
Obsession" into a kaleidoscopic series of scenes reflecting the fear, hope and 
confusion of everyday people in the melting pot. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough Polish American cop recounts how he was ostracized by peers for 
bucking a racist policy. A man worries that Latinos on television are only 
shown "in street gangs, immigration raids or drug busts." And African Americans 
notice the not-so-subtle ways they are shunned in restaurants and on subways. 
</P>
<P>
 The material, at least as arranged by Pachino, has an unmistakably 
left-leaning spin, with a tendency to break whites down into camps of the 
enlightened and the ignorant. But the show's poignant insight and occasionally 
mordant humor more than compensate. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-directors Ivan Spiegel and Jimm Giannini choreograph the brief scenes with 
admirable theatrical flair, and the nine-member ensemble, while occasionally 
stumbling during the review performance, nevertheless found the poetry in these 
real-life monologues. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Race," Burbage Theatre, 2330 Sawtelle Blvd., West Los Angeles. Thursdays 8 
p.m., Fridays and Saturdays 7:30 p.m. Ends Sept. 10. $15. (310) 478-0897.

THEATER BEAT: SOME MOMENTS IN 'MOON' AT RENEGADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One expects certain conventions from a play set in Mississippi during the 
1950s, and "Under the Moon," Layce Gardner's new drama at American Renegade 
Theatre in North Hollywood, does not disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a tobacco-chewing redneck, an ornery deputy and even a Ku Klux Klan 
cross-burning.Such devices give this interracial love story an instantly 
recognizable setting, if not a fresh and credible viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The play manages to find a few genuine moments in its tale of Opal (Gail 
Bearden), a hardscrabble white widow struggling to accept the budding romance 
between her eldest daughter, Juba (Cheryl Mahar), and a black man named Henry 
(Timothy D'Antwine). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the script tries to make drama out of blunt confrontations, where each 
character knows and speaks his or her mind, rather than building tension 
through ambiguity and suggestion. The characterizations feel stenciled and 
flat, and even fleetingly lyrical passages -- Opal's reminiscence of her dead 
husband, for instance -- recall far better plays by Tennessee Williams and Beth 
Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors rarely rise above one-note portrayals, although director David A. 
Cox's staging can at times be moody and evocative. 
</P>

Hollywood. Friday and Saturday 8 p.m., Sunday 7 p.m. Ends Sept. 11. $10-$12.

JAZZ REVIEW; ROSEMARY CLOONEY HIGHLIGHTS MISSED-OPPORTUNITY BOWL BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Carnegie Hall Jazz Band is one of the finest large jazz ensembles in the 
country. Organized in 1992, they are a talented assemblage of New York players 
whose skills range easily from the traditional to the avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Jazz Band had very little real opportunity to strut its stuff in a 
debut performance at the Hollywood Bowl Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than fully display the group's versatility, trumpeter Jon Faddis, the 
group's music director, elected to present a program dominated by an 
inordinately lengthy tribute to Benny Goodman. Contemporary reworkings of such 
Goodman classics as "Let's Dance," "Memories of You" and "Sing, Sing Sing" by 
arranger Jim McNeely effectively locked the Jazz Band into a single stylistic 
box. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some occasional excellent soloing from Bobby Watson, Ralph Moore and 
Renee Rosnes, the bottom line on the revision of well-known jazz numbers is, 
simply, whether or not a new perspective can be offered without damaging the 
originals. In this case, the Goodman retrospective too often seemed to be 
cranking out massive dissonances and offset rhythms that interfered with, 
rather than enhanced, the natural, flowing swing of familiar music. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Jazz Band's versatility was more appealingly visible in the 
subtle and supportive background they supplied for Rosemary Clooney. At 66, the 
still sweet-voiced pop star of the '50s has matured into a gifted ballad singer 
with a sympathetic understanding of jazz rhythms. Well aware of the talent in 
her accompanying ensemble, Clooney made the most of it, especially on such 
slower tunes as "How Deep Is the Ocean?" and "Sophisticated Lady." Curiously, 
her slight hoarseness, coupled with a somewhat pinched upper range helped her 
interpretations, adding a touch of vulnerability that was strikingly effective 
in a world-weary and (for a song traditionally sung by aging men) 
gender-switching reading of "September Song." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Haden's Quartet West, opening the show, had almost no chance to 
stretch out in their brief, three-number segment. The addition of harmonica 
player Toots Thielemans triggered some crisply professional improvisational 
segments, most notably during a lovely rendering of Henry Mancini's "Days of 
Wine and Roses" and a spirited romp through "Au Privave." But the obvious lack 
of preparation precluded the possibility that the music would come together in 
any kind of purposeful fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another example of the evening's unfulfilled jazz promises. On a 
program that could have, and should have, been far better (Clooney's bright 
moments aside), neither the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band nor Quartet West received 
the kind of meaningful showcase they deserved.

JAZZ NOTES: BAKERY'S MOVE: MORE SPACE, ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Jazz Bakery opens the doors at its new location on Wednesday, it will 
offer Los Angeles jazz listeners the rare mix of a nightclub and a concert 
hall, where major name performers will eventually be on tap six nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Bakery -- replete with a spiffy lobby that houses a food concession, 
ticket window and gift area -- is located at 3233 Helms Ave., Culver City, in a 
contemporary space that's part of the old Helms bakery building. Crisply 
designed by the Santa Monica-based architects Oakes and Associates, the new 
room is decidedly a step up from its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance space is wider, and deeper, and will comfortably seat 192 
people -- contrasted with 125 at the old Bakery. "One of the main improvements 
is the sight lines," says Ruth Price, the Bakery's director. Indeed, in the new 
space, no walls obscure the stage, unlike the current location, a half block 
east. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus is the new room's large stage. "We can now easily accommodate a 
big band," says Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Price plans to book artists six nights a week and will eventually try to book 
the same artist for a six-night stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to wait until I was really in the new space before I started the 
six-night bookings," says Price. So far, the only extended booking is pianist 
McCoy Tyner, who appears Sept. 13-18. Other notables heading for the Bakery 
include saxophonist Joe Lovano on Sept. 8, and Art Farmer and Illinois Jacquet 
(dates for these two performers have not been finalized). 
</P>
<P>
 The new Bakery will be christened Wednesday by a quintet led by vibist Terry 
Gibbs and clarinetist Buddy DeFranco, who'll play through Aug. 20. Then it's 
singer Sandra Booker on Aug. 23; bassist John Leitham's trio on Aug. 24; "Four 
Women Only" with Holly Hofmann, Cecilia Coleman, Nedra Wheeler and Janette 
Wrate on Aug. 25, and Alan Broadbent's trio on Aug. 26-27. Shows will begin at 
8 p.m. on weekdays, 8:30 p.m. on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is still in the $15-$20 range, though Price will no longer offer 
free refreshments. Instead, the new Bakery will have a small, independently 
operated concession area where sandwiches, salads, cappuccinos, wines by the 
glass and soft drinks will be served. Free security parking is outside on Helms 
Avenue and inside (entrance off Washington Boulevard). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bakery closes out at its old location this weekend. Tonight and Saturday, 
NYC-based pianist-singer Barbara Carroll appears, and on Sunday, Judy Wolman 
hosts "Sing, Sing, Sing" at 3:30 p.m. and singers Bruce Brown and Cathy Gelbart 
appear at 7:30 p.m. No closing festivities are planned. Information: (310) 
271-9039. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookin' at the Bakery: Terry Gibbs, a jazz notable since the late '40s when he 
played with Woody Herman, remains a true-blue be-bopper. And so is his partner, 
Buddy DeFranco. "We're both Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie freaks," says 
the ebullient Gibbs. "Those are our people, our idols. Their melodic lines were 
so beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 DeFranco, one of the first to emulate Parker on the clarinet, and Gibbs have 
been leading a quintet since 1980. The vibist feels they're ideal partners 
because they force each other to grow. "I think more harmonically because 
that's the way he plays, and he thinks more like a 'time player' because that's 
who I am," says Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though lately the pair has been playing tributes to Benny Goodman, the program 
at the Bakery will be pure mainstream jazz with a bop bent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll play originals, standards like 'Love for Sale,' then maybe Monk's '52nd 
Street Theme,' and some ballads," says Gibbs, who brings along Tom Ranier 
(piano), Andy Simpkins (bass) and his son, Gerry Gibbs (drums). " 'What's New' 
is my favorite ballad, and I've played it so many times that I've written 
several new melodies on the same chord changes. That way I think of the new 
tune when I'm soloing and it stays fresh."

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; AWKWARD FIT AS DEYOUNG GOES BROADWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps the kindest thing that can be said of the '70s rock band Styx is that 
its music was theatrical. So it makes sense that lead singer Dennis DeYoung has 
now turned his dramatic voice upon songs from the theater proper.Last year he 
washed his hands of rock 'n' roll for a while to appear as Pontius Pilate in 
"Jesus Christ Superstar," and he's just released an album of Broadway show 
tunes.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday at the Cinegrill, DeYoung's new mode seemed awkward at best. With 
his four-piece band gracelessly wailing away, and his mighty tenor drenched in 
reverb, the intimacy of the small room was immediately squandered. For a few 
brief moments, in "Summertime" and "Pilate's Dream," his vocals were gripping, 
but otherwise he opted for hyper-emotive overkill rather than gentle 
persuasion.  
</P>
<P>
 DeYoung clearly has a sense of humor about himself, but he and his band's 
relentless hamming and clowning gave the show the air of a cruise ship lounge 
rather than any Broadway stage. A doo-wop version of "On the Street Where You 
Live" from "My Fair Lady," performed to backing tapes with a great deal of 
shtick, was a low point of the set. Curiously, the evening ended not with a 
show tune but with a square, spiritless go at "Great Balls of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 And the versions of "Lady," "Babe" and "Come Sail Away" proved that Styx tunes 
don't sound any smarter in a cabaret setting than they've sounded anywhere 
else. CHUCK CRISAFULLI

THEATER REVIEW; 'SECRET HONOR': NIXONIAN CREDIBILITY GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Richard M. Nixon died more than three months ago, the Nixon Library 
still sells a T-shirt that proclaims "Nixon in '96 -- Tan, Rested and Ready!," 
according to a Times report earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet judging from the revival of "Secret Honor: The Last Testament of Richard 
M. Nixon," which opened at the Fountain Theatre on the 20th anniversary of 
Nixon's resignation, this classic American character will never rest. 
</P>
<P>
 He's in torment during most of this fictional monologue, written by Donald 
Freed and Arnold M. Stone and performed by the brilliant Philip Baker Hall, who 
created the role in 1983 at Los Angeles Actors' Theatre and performed Robert 
Altman's filmed version a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 This Nixon's even considering shooting himself. The former president loads and 
unloads a gun -- twice. 
</P>
<P>
 He's recording a plea to some unknown judge. He speaks usually in the first 
person, but occasionally in the third, referring to his "client." He repeatedly 
interrupts his pleading with reminiscences of his checkered career. Sometimes 
sardonic -- he laughs at some of his own mistakes -- but more often bitter, he 
attempts to justify himself as the authentic voice of the average American. Yet 
every few minutes he also snickers at the common folk. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half is an absorbing excursion into the man's soul. Hall is a wonder 
even before he speaks, shuffling around the former president's New Jersey 
office, trying to set up his recalcitrant tape recorder. Although Hall never 
resorts to a cliched impersonation, his suggestion of Nixon's physiognomy is 
frequently uncanny, especially in profile. And he makes Nixon's memories of his 
family genuinely moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the script eventually gets around to its major theme -- that 
Nixon was just a pawn for the Bohemian Grove crowd and their Jewish Mafia 
enforcers, and that he gallantly engineered his own disgrace so as to avert a 
fascist takeover of the government. It's not clear if this is supposed to be 
Nixon's self-deluding fantasy or if we're supposed to believe him, but the 
latter looks likely. 
</P>
<P>
 The substantiated details of the real Nixon's life and personality are so rich 
that such embellishments ought to be unnecessary. We leave wondering whether 
the play's credibility gap is as severe as Nixon's once was. Nowhere in the 
program notes is the fictional nature of the play emphasized -- it is referred 
to as "an eerie re-creation" in the producer's introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening also is too long -- almost two hours, about 25 minutes longer than 
the video. Director Mitchell Ryan doesn't sustain the dramatic momentum. In an 
interview, co-author Freed said he wants to present his new Pat Nixon monologue 
on a double bill with "Secret Honor." Let's hope he finds an editor first. 
</P>
<P>

5060 Fountain Ave., Hollywood. Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., except this 
Saturday, 3 p.m. Ends Aug. 27. $15-$17.50. (213) 663-1525. Running time: 1

RESTAURANT NOTES; OPUS IN WATER GARDEN CLOSES DOORS ON LOW NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two and a half years, Opus restaurant in Santa Monica has closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bent over backwards to make this place work," says Charles Almond, the 
managing partner. "We had just started to break even and most likely would have 
turned the restaurant around." 
</P>
<P>
 When the expensive, grown-up French seafood restaurant first opened, it was 
patterned after New York's celebrated Le Bernardin. The Manhattan restaurant's 
former chef, Eberhard Mueller, proclaimed he was going to use the same 
products, ingredients and suppliers as he did in New York. He even brought some 
of his kitchen staff and recipes when he came out West, including the famous 
hand-pounded carpaccio of tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite its much-hyped arrival, Opus never really took off. Located in 
Santa Monica's huge Water Garden, the brand-new office building, bewildered 
customers wandered around the complex wondering if the had the right address. 
Six months later chef Mueller left under somewhat mysterious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never meant to be some kind of an elitist restaurant that was out of touch 
with everybody," Almond told Calendar at that time. The sleek, curvy restaurant 
got friendlier; the food better, cheaper -- and meatier. Still, the place 
somehow never really flourished at the Water Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Almond, who is busy trying to find jobs for his loyal employees, remains 
philosophical about the situation. "In a business where 85% fail in the first 
five years, I guess we just didn't get on the right side of the numbers game." 
</P>
<P>
 Almond said the final straw came when the partners attempted to renegotiate 
the lease. Water Garden management did not return Calendar's phone calls for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Closure: Desperados Hollywood Cantina & Cafe on Melrose has closed 
after a 90-day run, despite the owners' desperate steps to hype their Rosarita 
Beach-style cantina. When they first opened the upstairs cafe, they sent out 
"Desperado girls" in cowboy boots and scanty costumes to stroll up and down 
Melrose Avenue passing out menus and souvenir key chains. The advertising 
gimmick apparently didn't work. Or maybe the locals were just too lazy to climb 
the stairs to see what all the hullabaloo was about. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo-ing: The exclusive, ultra-luxurious Buffalo Club, the creation of 
screenwriter Anthony Yerkovich, is finally on the verge of opening. Not only 
has the high-end sound system already been installed, but the glassware and 
china have also been selected, says our source. And the notoriously secretive 
Yerkovich has approved the menu submitted by consulting chef Patrick Healy, who 
is executive chef at Xiomara in Pasadena. Healy's American-style menu for the 
rustic-themed Santa Monica restaurant will feature macaroni and cheese, chicken 
pot pie and buffalo wings -- no doubt with a Healy twist. 
</P>
<P>
 According to our source, Yerkovich, who created the TV series "Miami Vice," 
was inspired to build the exclusive club as a cozier alternative to the new and 
bigger Morton's. Yerkovich was out of town and could not be reached for 
comment. Healy also declined comment. When we telephoned the club, manager Tom 
Kane was on a ladder touching up the paint. "It's Tony's deal," said Kane, 
refusing to confirm anything. "He has the whole master plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Abroad: Ralf Marhencke was one of the first to cook purple potatoes way 
back when Kenji Seki ran the now-defunct Noa Noa. He then moved on to Mario 
Oliver's Tryst until last year, when that trendy venue closed. He's now left 
the country and is cooking at the luxurious 60-room Hotel Rafael in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey Lurkey: Stan Levine, who owns Chicken Factory & More restaurants in 
Torrance and Manhattan Beach, has developed the "roast turkey steak." According 
to Levine, the eight-ounce, 100% turkey steak tastes like a cross between 
turkey and pork, yet it contains only 1% fat. Instead of being flaked or 
formed, it has the texture of steak, so he says. At Chicken Factory & More, the 
$7.49 roast turkey steak dinner includes salad, potato and a biscuit. "(Roast 
turkey steak) is unique to our restaurant so far," the culinary innovator says, 
"but the item is so delicious, you'll probably see it in other restaurants by 
the end of the year."

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: A CRITIXX CHOICE OF ECLECTIC TAPAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The play is over. The crowd files out into the balmy summer night, hesitating 
in the courtyard in front of the historic Pasadena Playhouse. It's only a 
little past 10:30, too early for the evening to end. What next? 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is very close at hand. Step next door to Critixx for a glass of 
fino sherry and a wedge of potato-and-egg tortilla dribbled with aioli or 
flaky-crusted empanadas filled with spicy Cuban-style ropa vieja. Set in a long 
narrow space with rough stucco walls stained a deep gold, this spirited new 
restaurant and bar features cold and hot tapas. Normally, that would mean the 
little dishes of Spain, especially those of Andalusia in the south. At Critixx, 
Sharon and Patrick Westmoreland, who also own Pasadena's Roxxi, have taken 
their inspiration not only from Spain, but also from Italy, Greece, China, 
Japan and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, admittedly, a very loose interpretation. "Tapas also represents a 
lifestyle -- a relaxed, unhurried and informal atmosphere, which we felt was a 
natural complement to the easygoing environment of Southern California," the 
Westmorelands have proclaimed. The tapas lifestyle? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing leisurely about the service here, though we did end up lingering over 
the grilled Portobello mushroom cap, a bowl of garlicky steamed mussels, "jerk" 
chicken, and seared sea scallops in a delicious hazelnut romesco sauce with a 
rough texture. 
</P>
<P>
 Critixx is perfect for a pre- or post-theater snack, but you can also show up 
-- ticket or no -- just to eat. (N.B. Famished fans can also get a handful of 
heartier entrees.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Critixx Restaurant & Bar, at the Pasadena Playhouse, 39 S. El Molino Ave . , 
Pasadena; (818) 577-9944. Open 11:30 a.m.-11 p . m . Tuesday-Friday, to 
midnight on Saturday, and until 10 p.m. on Sunday. All major credit cards. 
Charge for parking in lot. Tapas $3.25-$6.95; entrees $12.95-$16.95. S. IRENE

RESTAURANT REVIEW; TUCAN: MOLE THAT'S EASY TO SWALLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a child, I'd gaze with fascination into a pot of mole on a neighbor's 
stove: shreds of meat and knuckle-y turkey bones poked out of a thick, dark, 
marrow-colored sauce in what seemed a potent, mysterious voodoo stew. The blend 
of chiles, unsweetened chocolate and ground nuts, however, was too complicated 
and baffling for me then. It wasn't until my 20s that I fell in love with the 
stuff and began to search for it on menus.  
</P>
<P>
 I remember clearly the first nouvelle mole I ever had. It was seven years ago 
at Cha Cha Cha: a boneless chicken breast coated in a rich, piquant, not very 
chocolaty sauce -- a far cry from what bubbled on my neighbor's stove. Mario 
Tamayo, stopping by the table, explained that his clientele wouldn't be amused 
by a voodoo stew: They wanted white meat, elegant presentation -- a more 
user-friendly mole.  
</P>
<P>
 This temperate approach to mole and other Mexican and Caribbean dishes has 
since evolved into a kind of flexible, urbane local cuisine, much of it 
disseminated by relatives of Cha Cha Cha's co-founder Toribio Prado. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently encountered such a mole at the reasonably priced Tucan in Culver 
City, right down the boulevard from Bamboo. Tucan's owner, Rodolfo Mendoza, is 
the brother of Bamboo's owner, Jose Mendoza, and both are cousins of Toribio 
Prado. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucan has the casual coffee shop feel of an old House of Pies or IHOP. But the 
beams have been painted bright blue, the booths are bedecked in green and 
purple, the walls covered in Aztec motifs and fluorescent, black-lighted murals 
of tigers, tropical foliage and those banana-billed namesake birds. Food comes 
on colorful neo-Fiesta Ware. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucan is especially popular at lunch, when workers funnel in from nearby 
studios. Evenings are quieter: A few families and couples wander in from the 
neighborhood. Single people may find Tucan one of the rare places they can feel 
comfortable dining alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff, gracious and attentive, tries hard to please. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Tucan's food shares the same fresh edge with Bamboo's more eclectic 
Caribbean cooking, the menu is exclusively Mexican: There is no pizza, no corn 
chowder, no Caesar salad. The emphasis is on corn-oriented Central Mexican 
cooking. Tamales, slim, solid bars of sweet, husk-infused masa, are topped with 
sour cream and a roasted tomatillo salsa. Chicken sopes, two round, little corn 
boats filled with spiced stewed meat and beans, are pleasurably chewy and 
juicy. A more delicate container for virtually the same ingredients is the 
gordita, a thin, pale golden corn disc that's stuffed, in our case, with 
delicious, chopped, grilled vegetables, beans, crema and queso fresco. Tiny -- 
too tiny -- daubs of good guacamole accompany these items. 
</P>
<P>
 Tortilla soup, sopa Maya, is a broth with a slight bouillon flavor in which 
float tortilla strips, slices of ripe avocado and, surprisingly, fresh 
mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
 The cactus salad is one small, temptingly grilled paddle splayed on a bed of 
Roma tomato chunks in vinaigrette: Fewer, riper, tastier tomatoes would make 
this a far better dish. I was also disappointed in the Tulun salad, large 
chunks of jicama and papaya dressed, to no apparent advantage, with plain 
yogurt and fresh dill. 
</P>
<P>
 The same few ingredients appear over and over again in slightly different 
configurations. Toco Tucan is essentially a salad of the same chopped grilled 
vegetables we had in the vegetable gordita, with chunks of grilled chicken.  
</P>
<P>
 We recognized Bamboo's Indian pepper sauce, here with tiny bits of caramelized 
pineapple, on a perfectly cooked wedge of salmon. A seared ahi filet, similarly 
well-handled, is topped with more roasted tomatillo salsa and a puzzling dash 
of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both shrimp dishes, the spicy, tomato-sauced a la diabla and the garlic-spiked 
buttery al mojo de ajo, are lively, but even at $11.75, one wants more than 
four medium-sized shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, of course, there's the Oaxacan mole. It's not at all the dark, 
earthy, chocolaty stew I remember eating in Oaxaca; rather it's a slightly dry, 
boneless skinless chicken breast in a sharp, sweet, nutty chile sauce -- very 
user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tucan Restaurant, 9609 Venice Blvd., Culver City, (310) 287-0130. Open 7 
days for lunch and dinner. Beer served. Parking in lot. Major credit cards 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $21-$34.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; OVERDONE MEAT LOAF GOES A LONG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here in the '90s, Neil Young is the closest thing we have to a sage who, by 
example rather than by sermonizing, can remind us of the essential things in 
rock. And ol' Neil never spoke more truly than when he sang the refrain "You 
were born to rock, you'll never be an opera star." 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Lee Aday, better known as Meat Loaf, is no Youngian. He thinks he can 
have it both ways, that rock can be pumped up to extreme, operatic proportions 
without turning into a listing, overstuffed blimp. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some people really like blimps. Meat Loaf became a star in 1977 
with his album "Bat Out of Hell," which has sold more than 25 million copies 
worldwide, according to his official record company bio. 
</P>
<P>
 The air quickly went out of his career after that. But last year he resumed 
his recording partnership with Jim Steinman, who had written and produced "Bat 
Out of Hell." To make sure people got the connection, the resulting album was 
dubbed "Bat Out of Hell II." Sales for "Bat II" have topped 4 million in the 
United States alone, placing Meat Loaf back on the menu of arena headliners. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from his show Wednesday night at a half-full Irvine Meadows, the Three 
Tenors don't have to worry about another very large person hopping on their 
gravy train. Meat Loaf's hoarse voice was Ken-L-Ration and his material was 
USDA Grade Q. 
</P>
<P>
 A cliche-bound but occasionally feisty band did its best to prop up the star, 
as did Patricia Rousseau, a throaty alto who sang duets and backups and often 
covered for the diminished Meat. Take the high notes away from a would-be 
theatrical tenor and you have a musical cripple. Meat Loaf, evidently overtaxed 
by the rigors of his first major tour in years, didn't even try to span the 
full range required by his songs, croaking the nearest approximations he could 
muster, or taking the Rex Harrison declaim-what-you-can't-sing approach. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one thing you can't take away from Meat Loaf (or from Steinman, whose 
name went unmentioned by a star who had profuse thanks for everybody else 
surrounding him) and that's "Paradise by the Dashboard Light," a marvelous 
piece of recording from "Bat I" that has held up well over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With its episodic musical structure and grand scale, the song has that epic 
quality Meat Loaf favors. But its combination of earthiness, innocence and 
broad comedy in dealing with teen-age lust and its long-range consequences 
frees it from his customary pomposity. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't write off a Meat Loaf concert if it includes a well-done 
"Dashboard," and this show ended with a richly entertaining version that lasted 
at least 25 minutes. It was the only song Meat Loaf performed in his 40-minute 
encore, which actually was a fun rock show within a leaden one. 
</P>
<P>
 Meat Loaf began the segment with a nice piece of mime, conducting the audience 
in synchronized yelling as if the fans were a symphony and he was a maestro. 
Without opening his mouth, he was more entertaining and enlivening than he had 
been when trying to sing. 
</P>
<P>
 The encore also included a speech stating his gratitude at being back in the 
limelight, made with so much fervor and verge-of-tears sincerity that you'd 
have thought he was accepting an Oscar or a Grammy. Then, finally, came 
"Dashboard," expanded with extra dialogue and play-acting that included Meat 
Loaf's demonstration of flamenco dancing. It was hokey but good fun, and it 
made it possible to overlook some of the dreariness that had gone before. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mystery why Meat Loaf doesn't try more often to tie his overblown 
musical style to humorous, down-to-earth situations. It certainly doesn't 
happen on the rest of the two "Bat" albums, which supplied all the material for 
a nearly two-hour performance that included just eight songs (those inflated 
lengths say a lot about Meat Loaf's taste for largeness). 
</P>
<P>
 The 70-minute pre-encore set often found Meat Loaf bent over at the waist in 
straining poses that recalled Atlas struggling to hold up the world. Loaf's was 
far too heavy a load to carry, given the dead weight of such bombastic songs as 
"Life Is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back," a dark and stormy number built 
around an ominous keyboard riff lifted from Pink Floyd's "Welcome to the 
Machine." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bat Out of Hell" was a bad knockoff of "Born to Run"-era Springsteen, 
although its up-tempo instrumental sections were a good showcase for the band. 
Among the players and singers were Utopia alumnus Kasim Sultan on keyboards and 
rhythm guitar; a strong bassist, Steve Buslowe, and backup singer Pearl Aday, 
the elder of Meat Loaf's two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than "Paradise by the Dashboard Light," the only songs from the Meat 
Loaf catalogue that amount to anything are the Phil Spector tribute "You Took 
the Words Right Out of My Mouth" and Loaf's comeback hit, "I'd Do Anything for 
Love (But I Won't Do That)." Both were hampered by Meat Loaf's voice troubles, 
and by his insistence on trying to be Heathcliff (not the cartoon cat, but the 
darkly romantic hero of "Wuthering Heights") when he should have been playing 
for laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Openers Cheap Trick are fellow alumni of Meat Loaf's debut class of '77, and 
they have contributed far more to our treasury of exuberant, catchy rock songs 
than the headliner has. 
</P>
<P>
 During its successful early days, Cheap Trick won over arena-rock fans with 
that exuberance, but the four-man band from Rockford, Ill., also captured some 
punk and New Wave fans who could appreciate Rick Nielsen's brawny, slashing 
guitar playing and the pronounced weird streak and wry cynicism toward 
authority that crept into Cheap Trick's songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Time hasn't eroded Cheap Trick's skills a bit. Robin Zander remains an 
exceptional rock singer, an American McCartney who can rasp out a convincing 
rocker or croon a creamy ballad. Nielsen spun out solos with casual aplomb, and 
he still likes to roam the stage restlessly and to punctuate his playing with 
leaps and kicks. But, wrapped in a black suit and shades befitting a Blues 
Brother, and hidden behind a mustache and beard that a Confederate cavalry 
officer might have worn, he no longer has the zany edge that made him a nice 
foil for Zander, the blond dreamboat straight man. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, which also includes founding drummer Bun E. Carlos (looking a lot 
like a bald, scraggly-bearded Allen Ginsberg) and original bassist Tom 
Petersson, front-loaded its 40-minute set with material from its current album, 
"Woke Up With a Monster." It was catchy, and rocked persuasively, but aside 
from the title track, which seems to be about the emotional harm that comes 
from growing up in a disharmonious family, it was lightweight. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of Cheap Trick's early appeal was based on a youthful irreverence and 
effervescence that is hard for musicians in their 40s to recapture. The band 
hasn't been able to write a new chapter for itself, except for "The Flame," a 
soppy if attractive power-ballad hit from 1988, and the old script requires a 
spark of youth that is missing. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left are good, energetic playing and catchy songs that to an extent 
justify themselves. What's missing are the agenda and sense of mission and 
direction that make a band continue to matter.

RAMSEY LEWIS HANGS ON TO HIS POPULAR HITS; JAZZ: IN 'SKY ISLANDS,' WHICH

 Ramsey Lewis' version of "Hang On Sloopy" was, in the late '60s, the perfect 
party track: upbeat, swinging and lively.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taking off from the familiar refrain, in which a number of voices could be 
heard singing the lyric somewhere in the background, Lewis scored a big hit by 
turning the '60s pop ditty into a rhythmic workout full of upper register 
trills and a gospel-like fervor, while the sound of laughter and tinkling 
glassware provided a live recording session feel.

 It wasn't the first time Lewis hit the charts by turning a pop tune into an 
instrumental jazz number. In 1965, he broke from his Chicago-bound reputation 
onto the national charts with singer Dobie Gray's "The In Crowd," followed the 
next year by "Wade in the Water," also by Gray. His trio, which then included 
drummer and Earth, Wind and Fire founding member Maurice White, broke club 
records around the country and appeared at Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The formula -- taking pop tunes and infusing them with jazz sensibilities, 
sometimes in a trio format, sometimes with orchestra -- served Lewis well in 
the years before 1971, during which he released about 30 albums, mostly for the 
Chicago-based Chess label. In the years that followed, Lewis may have faded 
from the pop charts, but he still remains true to his chosen direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence comes on his latest release for the GRP label, "Sky Islands," on 
which he covers tunes from Lionel Richie, Janet Jackson and, as he has for 
years, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The album also marks a reunion with 
Earth, Wind and Fire's White, who helped produce the CD. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to stay true to my goals," Lewis said from his Chicago home. "To 
explore interesting harmonic progressions and work with melodies that sing." 
</P>
<P>
 But while the direction remains the same, Lewis, who plays Saturday at the 
Long Beach Jazz Festival, has kept contemporary, utilizing synthesizers played 
by Michael Logan to provide orchestral texture, bringing in the strong vocal 
presence of Eve Cornelius on Richie's "Love Will Find a Way" and updating the 
entire sound with thumb-pounded electric bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those traditional jazz rhythms as inspired by the great artists, that 
straight-ahead, 4/4 feeling, is always there," he said, "but I try to allow 
myself to be influenced by current rhythms and sounds. And when I'm not, I have 
two sons who pull me by the coattails in that direction." (Lewis' son Frayne 
Lewis co-produced "Sky Islands" with White, his father and others.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also present on the album is a medley of Lewis' biggest successes, "Wade in 
the Water," "The In Crowd" and "Hang On Sloopy" complete with voices joining in 
on the Sloopy refrain. With lots of brass, a passage of rippling steel drums 
created by synthesizer and Lewis' trademark hipster pianisms, the cut, compared 
to the earthiness of the originals, says a lot about the keyboardist's current 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to exclude those songs from my shows at various times. And 
invariably a ton of people come up and say, 'Why didn't you play 'Wade in the 
Water' or 'Hang On Sloopy'?" I thought that people would eventually get tired 
of hearing them, but I guess not. It was my wife who suggested that I combine 
them in a medley. And it works." 
</P>
<P>
 And the piano playing that goes into that medley is not the same as the '60s 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference now is that I try to be more economical with notes and a bit 
more introspective with the solos. It's not something I have to make an effort 
to do. It's just the way I feel about life and music these days." 
</P>
<P>
 GRP, which is reissuing a host of treasures from the Chess label archives, has 
provided fuel for past-present comparison with the release of "Maiden Voyage 
(and More)," a string and orchestra embellished collection from 1968 arranged 
by Lewis' late friend Charles Stepney. Lennon and McCartney's "Julia," which 
reappears on the current "Sky Islands" release, is given the full orchestral 
treatment on the '60s recording, with Lewis embellishing the theme behind the 
ensemble before tracking the chorus with rich chords. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles was the staff arranger for Chess in the early '60s," said Lewis, who 
says in the liner notes to "Maiden Voyage" that Stepney (who died in 1976) was 
the equal of arranger-bandleader Quincy Jones. "I heard some of his work and it 
smacked of classical music. And when we got to talking, we found out we shared 
common ground, not only in music, but in our life philosophy as well. His star 
was just beginning to shine when he passed away." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he intentionally tried to stay true to Stepney's arrangement of 
"Julia" on the current release. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always ask us to play it, and we still play (Stepney's) 'Close Your 
Eyes and Remember' in concert. His music has that timeless attraction. Whether 
it was written 400 years ago by the classical composers or 50 years ago by Duke 
Ellington, great music has that aspect; it touches the listener. You can change 
the rhythm and make it more current, but the heart of it never changes. Tony 
Bennett is now teaching us all a thing or two about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important ingredient is moving the audience, the desire to touch a 
person's heart as well as his head. The great music from musicians like Charlie 
Parker and Duke Ellington really moves you. They can make you laugh or cry or 
feel joy. Intellect and emotion has to be stirred up together."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though busy touring the States this year, Lewis will find time to join Grover 
Washington Jr. in a project dubbed "Urban Knights," which will be unveiled 
later this year. In addition, he just completed 17 one-hour television specials 
dubbed "Bet on Jazz" for the Black Entertainment Cable Network and continues to 
host the syndicated radio program "The Ramsey Lewis Show" that originates from 
his hometown. In 1995, he makes a world tour with his combo. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those performing with him in Long Beach will be longtime associate 
guitarist Henry Johnson, as well as electric keyboardist Logan.  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea for Logan is to take the place of the orchestra; strings, 
horns or whatever sound we need. It gives the group a bigger sound." 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; PHIL COLLINS: AS ALWAYS, THE EVERYGUY OF POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the last 25 years, Phil Collins has undergone one of the odder 
transformations in pop music. He began his career drumming with Genesis when 
the band was led by Peter Gabriel and was considered one of the headier British 
art-rock outfits. Collins since has become a mega-successful mainstream 
crooner. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 35 million records sold and a half-dozen Grammys collected for 
his post-Genesis work, Collins doesn't have many pop summits left to conquer. 
He does, however, have plenty of fans to entertain and, on Monday at the Forum, 
dependable entertainment value is what they got from the affable singer, who 
plays Irvine Meadows tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pair of sets that added up to nearly three hours of sturdily constructed, 
energetically delivered pop tunes, Collins demonstrated that even though it has 
been four years since his last tour, he is still a consummate crowd-pleaser. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a stage resembling a kind of quaint urban wasteland complete with blazing 
trash can, changeable billboard and sparking elevated train, he ambled about 
and led his four-piece band through all the hits and a good deal of new 
material. Though his muse has long been anchored in the mainstream, and 
predictable showmanship has superseded any spontaneity in the music, his 
cheerful stage presence kept the show rolling forward. 
</P>
<P>
 He played a couple of songs on the piano and sat down at an extra set of drums 
just in time to play the thundering signature fill during "In the Air Tonight." 
He belted out such heartfelt confessionals as "Take a Look at Me Now" with 
straightforward intensity, and between songs he was like a cheeky music-hall 
comedian, winning over the crowd with slightly risque monologues.  
</P>
<P>
 His band was perfectly polished, entirely competent and almost completely 
without soul. The singer alone gave the music some heart. Collins' voice is not 
commanding but he pulled emotional nuances out of his tales of fractured 
romance and unrequited love, and added pep to the upbeat numbers in the second 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Collins is the pop star as Everyguy. His guileless approach to his craft and 
his willingness to poke fun at himself and his non-matinee idol looks combine 
to make him one of the more likable and less lordly of pop luminaries. His 
down-to-earth manner prevails when his material nears mawkishness, and even his 
clunky version of "You Can't Hurry Love" becomes easier to take when you see 
what a good time he has singing it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Phil Collins sings tonight at 8 at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 
Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. $25-$52.50. (714) 740-2000.

DOUBLE DOSE OF RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN; VIDEO: FOX OFFERS SIX MUSICALS AT LOWER 
PRICES AND WITH BONUS SOUNDTRACK AUDIOCASSETTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Free audiotapes! 
</P>
<P>
 That's what FoxVideo's promotion of vintage musicals amounts to. 
</P>
<P>
 Videotapes of six Rodgers & Hammerstein musicals will now be packaged with an 
audiotape of its soundtrack. The packages, due out Tuesday, are "The Sound of 
Music," "Oklahoma!," "The King and I," "Carousel," "South Pacific" and "State 
Fair." 
</P>
<P>
 For consumers, the biggest plus is the price. Rather than the cost increasing 
because of the addition of an audiotape, it's actually going down. The videos 
are $20, except for the two-cassette "Sound of Music," which will sell for $24. 
Until now, five of the videotapes cost $24 each, with "Sound of Music"' at $30. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way of remarketing a product that had stopped showing any sales 
return," FoxVideo marketing director Deborah Mitchell explained. "These 
soundtracks are available in stores, but I'm sure the sales rate is small." 
</P>
<P>
 FoxVideo also has added trailers and newsreel footage to the videos. And 
"State Fair" also includes previously unreleased outtakes. Hardly anything has 
been added to the audiotapes, except some songs on the "The Sound of Music" 
soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 FoxVideo successfully inaugurated this video/soundtrack promotion last year 
with "The Last of the Mohicans," with the package selling for $25. Mitchell 
declined to reveal figures but said that the package did double the expected 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 With movie soundtracks being so popular, from "The Lion King" to "Sleepless in 
Seattle" to "Above the Rim," don't be surprised if other video companies start 
using this dual-package plan, particularly to rekindle interest in titles that 
are a few years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia 
</P>
<P>
 The Muppets always seemed like a natural for the interactive market. They'll 
finally make their debut next year, on games and CD-ROMs. . . . Clint Eastwood 
debuts on CD-ROM next year on a disc devoted to his life and times. He's 
helping with the project, even doing an exclusive interview. It will be 
fan-oriented as well as providing substantive information geared to scholars. . 
. . Laserdisc distributor Image Entertainment plans to enter the CD-ROM market 
in October, with titles mainly in the action/adventure genre, such as "The 
Terminator" and "RoboCop," priced in the $10-$20 range. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest 
</P>
<P>
 For fans of old TV Westerns, the two-hour documentary "TV's Western Heroes" is 
a must. It's a collection of clips about series such as "Maverick," "Yancy 
Derringer" and "The Rifleman," featuring the introductory segments, ads and 
trailers as well as footage from the shows. Host Will Hutchins, who starred in 
the 'Sugarfoot" series, dispenses information geared to nostalgia buffs. From 
GoodTimes at $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everything you ever wanted to know about coffee is in the one-hour 
documentary, "Gourmet Coffee." While offering a historical and cultural 
perspective it's also a handy guide to all the varieties of coffee. For $20 
from Flessing, Flessing and Walters (800-786-8433). . . . On Aug. 23 at $15, 
PolyGram is releasing the hour documentary, "The Story of World Cup USA '94," 
including highlights of the recent soccer tournament and some behind-the-scenes 
footage not seen on TV. Foreign Movies 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia TriStar's "Faraway, So Close" -- director Wim Wenders' sequel to his 
1988 hit, "Wings of Desire" -- is just out. Featuring Nastassja Kinski and Otto 
Sander, this one is also about angels on Earth. Interesting because of offbeat 
subject matter and existential textures, but not as good as the original. 
Still, for foreign-film buffs, definitely worth a look. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Kino is releasing Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's famed 
"Dersu Uzala," about a Mongolian adventurer. Made for a Russian studio, it won 
the 1975 Oscar for best foreign-language film. . . . The French drama "Dr. 
Petiot," about a French doctor who killed Jews during World War II, is due on 
Aug. 24 from World Artists. What's New on Video:  
</P>
<P>
 "Beethoven's 2nd" (MCA/Universal). Kids in particular should appreciate this 
cozy sequel to the 1992 hit comedy about the Newton family and its Saint 
Bernard named Beethoven. In the sequel, the dog's mate has pups and then is 
snatched by a vengeful dognaper (Debi Mazur). The stressed-out dad (Charles 
Grodin) must cope with both dog problems and the romantic traumas of his teen 
daughter (Nicholle Tom). Amiable, entertaining fluff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intersection" (Paramount). If you rent this movie figuring that a drama 
starring charismatic stars Richard Gere and Sharon Stone can't be all that bad, 
you'll most likely be sorry. During an auto accident, the messy life of an 
architect (Gere) flashes before his eyes. He's torn between a cold wife (Stone) 
and a bubbly mistress (Lolita Davidovitch). Convoluted, confusing and 
unsatisfying.  
</P>
<P>
 "My Girl 2" (Columbia TriStar). The further adventures of bright, imaginative 
Vada, played by Anna Chlumsky. In the early '70s, the 13-year-old heroine 
spends her spring vacation in L.A., visiting her uncle (Richard Mazur) and 
trying to find out more about her mother, who died when she was an infant. 
Meanwhile, she finds a mate (Austin O'Brien), the son of her uncle's 
girlfriend. Generally likable, largely because of the interesting lead 
character and another charming performance by Chlumsky -- but it turns very 
maudlin in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ref" (Touchstone). A surly burglar (Denis Leary) holds a warring married 
couple (Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey) captive in their home in the New England 
suburbs. Many critics dismissed this as shrill, crude and loaded with overkill 
humor. Those who savor oddball, nasty black comedies might find it quite 
savory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chasers" (Warner). An action comedy that's similar in theme to the 1973 Jack 
Nicholson movie, "The Last Detail." It's the screwball adventures of two Navy 
cops (Tom Berenger and William McNamara) escorting a rebellious female prisoner 
(Erika Eleniak) through the South to a military base. Directed by Dennis 
Hopper, it's lightweight, noisy, predictable, feel-good entertainment that's 
low on laughs.

TV REVIEW; 'RUNAWAY DAUGHTERS' TRAVELS A SPOOF-FILLED MEMORY LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 1957, and a sweet, barely post-virginal high school girl who's "late" 
believes herself to be preggers. A more worldly-wise friend assures her that 
matrimony is the easy solution to the whole problem, helpfully explaining the 
facts of life: "Sometimes, when a man and a woman like each other very much, 
they make a baby! That's where marriages come from." 
</P>
<P>
 And director Joe Dante is where wry, affectionate, nostalgic spoofery comes 
from. His "Runaway Daughters" -- premiering tonight on Showtime as part of the 
swell "Rebel Highway" series, where noted directors riff on remakes of old AIP 
drive-in staples -- makes a dandy small-screen companion piece to Dante's 
feature of last year, "Matinee." 
</P>
<P>
 Again scripted by frequent collaborator Charlie Haas, it's very much pregnant 
with (no pun intended) period chuckles.  
</P>
<P>
 Naive Mary (Holly Fields, looking like a younger Sheryl Lee) finally gives in 
to the sexual advances of her long-suffering boyfriend Bob (Chris Young) after 
he launches into a soliloquy on the portent posed by the orbiting Sputnik and 
she becomes convinced that her dudnik is a thoughtful futurist after all. Faced 
with fatherhood, Bob does what any fine fellow in a spot would do: He pledges 
his undying love and furtively enlists in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary's two pals (Julie Bowen and Jenny Lewis), leaving behind their own 
problems with boyfriends and parents, convince her that the three should fake 
their own kidnaping and drive to San Diego to intercept Bob before his ship 
sails. What ensues is a modest and funny road B-movie, a juve "Thelma & Louise" 
with pretensions not much greater than to invoke memories of over-watted 
Mexican AM radio, Russkie paranoia and hoods with hearts of gold.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the type of fond homage in which most characters are named after the 
original AIP feature's filmmakers, and there are cameos aplenty, some subtly 
hilarious (Fabian -- yes, Fabian -- as a grizzled, beer-swilling dad who nods 
as detective Dick Miller mutters, "They're a worthless generation"), some over 
the top (John Astin and Cathy Moriarty as literal Commie-hunters whom the girls 
encounter in the woods). 
</P>
<P>
 Even those not keyed in to Dante's in-jokes will probably enjoy the ride, 
thanks largely to terrific ensemble casting that balances familiar adult 
character actors with talented unknowns as the troubled teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially good among the younger set are Bowen as a licentious wanna-be who 
tries and fails to shock her unusually permissive parents, and Paul Rudd as her 
bad boy, who repeatedly whimpers "Don't crowd me!" with all the cool of 
somebody who's studied James Dean's "You're tearing me apart!" line reading a 
few too many times. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Runaway Daughters" premieres at 10 tonight on Showtime.

CAMERATA ADDS TWO CONCERT SERIES TO '94-'95 SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mozart Camerata will expand its 1994-95 season by adding a two-concert

Ami Porat conducting works by Mozart, Boccherini and Mendelssohn. This program 
will be repeated in Newport Beach at 4 p.m. on Sept. 25.

 "We're responding to subscriber requests," Porat said. "We've had substantial

Saturday dates." 
</P>
<P>
 The additional concerts, which will also be performed at St. Andrew's, will 
boost the annual budget by 10%, to $150,000, according to Porat, who will

 One flavor fit all back then: During this heat wave, let's all pause for a

 After the filming had finished, Weireter had a bigger role in a live TV drama

ROGER ALTMAN'S SENATE TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an exciting week of Senate Whitewater hearings, I have a few 
observations: It's pretty obvious that Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman 
did lie to the Senate, if not affirmatively, then by omission. I guess we 
should be thankful that even the partisan Democrats in the Senate did not gloss 
over Altman's lies. 
</P>
<P>
 However, what is difficult for me to understand is the hypocrisy of the 
Republican senators. A Democrat who lies to the Senate is not worthy of the 
office and should resign immediately. Yet these same Republican senators 
support the election to their august body of truth-tellers another well-known 
liar, Ollie North. This is the same North who admittedly lied to Congress. How 
can the senators expect anyone in office to tell them the truth when they 
willingly support the election of someone who has already lied to them? 
</P>
<P>
 I, as one of those American citizens the senators seemed so concerned about 
throughout the hearings, can only conclude that liars are welcomed as members 
of the Senate but cannot hold any other public office, appointed or elected. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Let's see if I have it right. The Republicans pushed the Whitewater hearings 
because they are upset that the Democratic Administation had been scurrying 
around asking anybody and everybody how to deal legally and ethically with a 
potential problem. Oh, if only previous Republican administrations had made the 
same effort prior to Watergate and Iran-Contra.

</P>
<P>
 Since when is it OK to perjure yourself before a congressional hearing "just 
because" others have done the same thing? Perhaps you would condone cheating 
"just because" the kids in last year's class did. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus on the issue. Altman lied to Congress. In my fourth-grade classroom, 
liars and cheaters get to miss recess. Perhaps Altman needs to be told to 
gracefully take the appropriate punishment: Time to step down, Marathon Man.

 Too bad Altman wasn't a Republican. Instead of using wordy phrases such as, 
"did shave the truth," "may have been misleading" and "less than candid," you 
could have saved a barrel of ink with "he lied," "he lied," "he lied."

 Congress seems to have reinstated the "third degree." The tactics used 
primarily by Republican senators, principally, Phil Gramm and the thoroughly 
unprincipled Alfonse D'Amato, allowing them to detain Altman into the wee small 
hours, about 10 straight, (Aug. 3), were to me unconscionable.

 If I could be shown that anyone so much as tried to impede the Whitewater 
investigation, I'd cheer his or her prosecution. But, in the absence of 
reasonable suspicion or evidence, it seems improper to examine the private 
thoughts and words of public officials who are not accused of actually doing 
anything wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 In ancient times citizens could be condemned for what they thought or said, 
without their ever having taken any wrongful actions. The Athenian senate 
condemned Socrates to death for what he thought and said. The Roman senate 
banished Cicero for what he thought and said. But American justice, usually, 
only examines the thoughts and words of persons after they have been accused of 
wrongdoing, not before. Thus, we avoid making a Greek or Roman circus of our 
justice. We tend to take freedom of thought for granted, and we have formally 
guaranteed freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 With regard to good or bad acts, President Clinton extended the statute of 
limitations on Whitewater, a good act which facilitated prosecution of 
Whitewater; and no bad acts (impeding prosecution) have been suggested by 
reasonable people, despite energetic inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 I watched with great sadness as the thought police and the speech police in 
the House and Senate persecuted, insulted and impugned public officials for 
what they have thought and said. So what if Altman agonized over propriety? So 
did Lincoln and Churchill. If no one can show that Altman or anyone else tried 
to impede justice -- which would be a crime -- what they thought and said 
(about the perception of hypothetical, potential wrongs not actually committed) 
should be deemed irrelevant.

KURT WALDHEIM: PAPAL KNIGHT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month, Pope John Paul II awarded a papal knighthood, the Order of Pius 
IX, to former Austrian President and onetime U.N. Secretary General Kurt 
Waldheim. The action, which took place in Vienna rather than in Rome, was not 
noted in the usual Vatican bulletins and is only now receiving wide notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldheim became an international pariah when his wartime collaboration with 
the Nazis came to light. A panel of historians commissioned by his own 
government to investigate his record concluded that he "repeatedly went along 
with unlawful acts" and that his claim that he knew nothing about deportation 
of Greek and Yugoslav civilians to Nazi death camps could not be believed. The 
U.S. Justice Department, as it put Waldheim on a not-welcome list, stated that 
he was implicated "in (wartime) acts which clearly constitute persecution under 
established legal precedent." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the Pope's decision merely to grant Waldheim an audience became a 
scandal. At the time, Vatican spokesmen insisted that there was nothing 
personal about this decision: The Pope was simply following protocol in 
receiving the president of a country that the pontiff had visited. 
</P>
<P>
 That explanation, scarcely credible at the time, has lost all credibility now. 
Whatever justification there was for receiving Waldheim, there is none for 
honoring him, even for his U.N. work. Had his collaboration been known, he 
would never have been appointed to any high-ranking U.N. post. The papal action 
is particularly inflammatory just now because of longstanding Serbian claims 
that the Croatian Catholic clergy collaborated with the Nazis in persecuting 
the Serbs.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pope's action is baffling, to say the least. Israel, which protested, was 
right to do so. The United States should protest as well. And Cardinal Roger 
Mahony of Los Angeles should at least privately make the Vatican aware of the 
local impact of this action. After the scandal of the 1987 meeting, a group of 
Los Angeles Jewish and Catholic leaders headed by Rabbi Alfred Wolf and Msgr. 
Royale M. Vadakin, representing Cardinal Mahony, worked hard to repair 
relations. The Vatican, with this new incomprehensible action, has now made 
good Catholic-Jewish relations that much harder to maintain.

AFRICA WATCH; PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House should send a special envoy such as veteran diplomat Donald F. 
McHenry to Nigeria, Rwanda and Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nigeria, McHenry, a professor at the Georgetown University School of 
Foreign Service and a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, might 
persuade the stubborn generals to free unconditionally Moshood Abiola, the 
leader who should be president based on last year's annulled election.The 
illegal military government had offered to release him from jail, but only if 
he promised never to engage in politics again. Abiola refused. So did his 
supporters -- millions of oil workers, students and other Nigerians who demand 
democracy. If this bitter quarrel turns to war, the populous West African 
nation could suffer as many as 1 million fatalities, double the body count in 
Rwanda's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nigeria, McHenry should go to Rwanda and Burundi, where he could 
encourage reconciliation between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority that 
dominates the governments and armies of both of the Central African nations. 
</P>
<P>
 There is now some hope in Rwanda. Representatives of the new, Tutsi-dominated 
government are reportedly holding talks with members of the defeated Hutu army. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Burundi is an ever-increasing worry. Tutsi youths, angered at the 
massacres of Tutsis who lived in Rwanda, seek revenge, and the Tutsi government 
is cracking down. The presence of a seasoned diplomat like Ambassador McHenry 
might help keep Burundi from exploding like Rwanda.

THINK OF SOMEONE BESIDES YOURSELVES; KEEP TALKING, STOP POSTURING IN BASEBALL 
DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when major league baseball has given us one of the brightest crops 
of young players in recent memory, at a time when the home run record is 
threatened as baseballs jump out of ballparks, at a time when realignment has 
produced lively division races, at a time when the World Cup gave sports fans 
something other than baseball during the summer, the game has shot itself in 
the foot.  
</P>
<P>
 The players have their own self-interested logic for a walkout: the likelihood 
of an imposed team salary cap by hostile owners on the horizon. And because 
relations between owners and players are notoriously bad (an antagonism fueled, 
by the way, by the owners' recent nose-thumbing refusal to contribute money to 
pensions), mistrust rules the roost. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is so typical of baseball's well-documented status as a 
dysfunctional family. Under the rubric of free enterprise and the American way, 
there is always some pious explanation for why the dollars ought to go into one 
relative's pocket and not the other's. 
</P>
<P>
 GET SERIOUS: It is time to get serious about changing the fundamental 
relationships. It is time to get the parties to consider first the interest of 
the game, and, in the process, the interest of fans. That will require a change 
in attitude and a willingness on occasion to give way to judgments by third 
parties. The time for this new approach is now. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides in the current dispute should begin the process by submitting 
their differences to binding arbitration, which is an idea already being 
proposed by no less an observer of the big picture than the president of the 
Rockefeller Foundation, Peter C. Goldmark Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's labor differences are full of complicated issues for the long term. 
They include the idea of a team salary cap, which at least needs to be 
considered if teams in small media markets are to remain viable. 
</P>
<P>
 GET IMAGINATIVE: Goldmark, in noting that a cap is unacceptable to the 
players, suggests that "imaginatively reconfigured, the 'salary cap' could 
become a 'percentage split,' which is an eminently sound basis on which 
partners in a business often share profits." How about it? The point is, there 
is plenty of room for creative thinking if the parties will think of themselves 
as partners in a venture rather than adversaries hoarding pieces of a pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Other continuing but complicated labor-management issues -- the sharing of 
revenue among franchises and between players, the terms under which free agency 
is allowed and the conditions of arbitration for individual player's salaries 
-- may bend more easily in the light of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever anybody thinks of any of these issues singly, the important point 
illustrated by the current impasse is that none can be solved or addressed 
adequately in isolation or in an atmosphere of hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball is a pastime and a unique business as well. But like any other 
enterprise, it must lend itself over time to creative and shared solutions. If 
not, like a poorly run business, it will lose customers.

HUGH HEFNER AND PLAYBOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing in reference to Steve Proffitt's interview with Hugh Hefner 
(Opinion, July 31). I was struck by the contrast between Hugh Hefner's 
perception of Playboy and my observations of its effect on society. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner mentions the founding of this country by Puritans. The attitudes they 
handed down discouraged communication about sex, creating an atmosphere void of 
healthy sexual growth or exploration. When Playboy appeared in the '50s, it 
represented a swing of the pendulum in the opposite direction. While it 
appeared to champion a positive perspective on sexual issues, it was no 
healthier or realistic than the Puritans. It just showed the other extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own words "sex can be twisted and exploited, but in its most essential 
form, it's the best part of who we are." Yet Playboy capitalized on sex and 
exploited it very successfully. Under the guise of encouraging open discussions 
about sex, it presented unrealistic images and fantasies that helped confuse 
and alienate the sexes. Presenting sex by surrounding it with self-proclaimed 
socially redeeming journalism does not promote true healthy sexuality. As a 
result women were compared to an unrealistic body image that men were 
encouraged to seek. Everyone was misled.  
</P>
<P>
 Healthy sexuality strives toward making relationships work, not by displaying 
intense, glamorous, beautiful people with their clothes off. The mixed messages 
he says this country suffers from have been fueled by this propaganda. If 
Hefner was so concerned about raising social consciousness, he could have 
created a publication that stood on its writings instead of its centerfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 ART KELLNER 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance 
</P>
<P>
 The interview was really wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 The only false note in the piece was the curious connection made between 
"plummeting" circulation and young people who found the magazine "either 
offensive or a curious anachronism in the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't "young people" who took away half our single-copy sales, sent hate 
mail to our advertisers and took away our casino licenses in London and 
Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 An unholy alliance between church and state played havoc with our circulation 
and advertising in the 1980s. A Falwell-Wildmon inspired letter sent by the 
Meese Commission to the Southland Corp., and to others, cost us the 7-Eleven 
stores and a number of other major convenience and drug chains.  
</P>
<P>
 It should be obvious to even the casual observer that powerful forces (some of 
them in the federal government) have been our enemy from the outset -- and we 
have never had the advantage of a truly open marketplace for the magazine or 
any of our subsidiary businesses.

L.A. THEME SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the few mistakes made during the 1984 Olympics was the City Council's 
rejection of Randy Newman's "I Love L.A." as the official song for our 
city.This street-level, upbeat tribute made us feel good every time we heard 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collective opinions of our town have taken a nose-dive in the last 
10 years, embracing "I Love L.A." might be just the positive kick we need to 
start our spirits back up again. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles was a great place to live in 1984, and it's a great place to live 
today. Let's make "I Love L.A." official.

BREAKING RULES OF A 'LIFE AND DEATH GAME'; LAW: MUST AN ATTORNEY FACE 
DISBARMENT FOR HELPING A CLIENT WHO DESIRES THE DEATH PENALTY ATTAIN THAT 
OBJECTIVE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE V. DENNY III, George V. Denny III is a criminal defense and 
civil-rights attorney and former president of the Los Angeles Criminal Courts 
Bar Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In light of the games being played out by both the prosecution and defense in 
the O.J. Simpson trial, how extraordinary to read of public defender Elliott 
Levine. It seems that both the Utah Supreme Court and the State Bar are ready 
to punish him for not playing "the game." That is the "life and death game" 
that attorneys are expected to play in murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In Utah -- as well as in other states -- the "rules" of the game appear to 
require that an attorney bend every effort, spare no expense and utilize every 
trick or loophole in the law to get his client acquitted or, at least, a life 
rather than a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of the client who doesn't want that type of representation? What if 
the client, having played the game before, wants no more of it? What if, after 
being told of all possible defenses and procedures to escape conviction and/or 
punishment, the client nevertheless wants to plead guilty in a capital case and 
submit himself to the death penalty? Does the life-and-death game require that 
his attorney act absolutely contrary to his client's wishes and diligently 
fight to prohibit the state from imposing the "ultimate penalty" of death? Is 
the attorney required to violate his client's trust and battle steadfastly to 
save him from the penalty he earnestly seeks? 
</P>
<P>
 Levine's client, James Holland, asked Levine to do nothing unethical. He 
sought no perjured testimony. He did not solicit research into the backgrounds 
of potential witnesses to embarrass and/or impeach them at trial. He asked for 
no experts whose testimony might raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of 
potential or actual jurors. Holland simply advised Levine that he had committed 
the two murders and multiple robberies and, having spent 35 of his 47 years in 
various reformatories, jails and prisons, he wanted to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine has been excoriated by the Utah Supreme Court in his representation of 
Holland and Von Lester Taylor, another multiple murderer (and arsonist and 
kidnaper), who, unlike Holland, did not want to be executed. By attempting to 
make a "proportionality argument" for Taylor, Levine called a willing Holland 
from prison to show the jury that Holland was a career criminal and three-time 
murderer who expressed little remorse and deserved the death penalty, whereas 
the much younger Taylor had a single prior felony burglary conviction and lots 
of remorse and did not deserve death. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial judge did not allow him to make full presentation of Holland's 
crimes. When Taylor's jury returned the not-unexpected death sentence, Levine 
filed an appellate brief with the Utah Supreme Court in which he claimed a 
denial of Taylor's rights because the trial judge had not allowed him to argue 
"that an individual such as James Holland is a prime candidate for the death 
penalty while Taylor is not."  
</P>
<P>
 Levine's candor and honesty were considered wholly inappropriate by the 
Supreme Court which, in order to "preserve the integrity of the judicial 
system," required that Levine withdraw from both the Taylor and Holland cases 
and referred the matter to the Utah State Bar for "appropriate action." 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1975, the states could force an attorney on a defendant in a capital 
case whether or not the defendant wanted to be so represented. Such a defendant 
could not represent himself because the Sixth Amendment did not in so many 
words give him that right. In Faretta vs. California, the U.S. Supreme Court 
specifically granted the right of self-representation in any case, including a 
death penalty case. If a defendant in a capital case can choose to represent 
himself, it seems illogical that he cannot choose an attorney who will help him 
attain his objective, whether that be acquittal, a plea bargain to a lesser 
offense or a conviction and execution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Telling it like it is" appears to disconcert public prosecutors and 
black-robed justices who (these days) are happy enough to uphold death 
sentences if they can say the convicted murderer got "effective representation" 
because his attorney "played the game" properly. In that way, prosecutors do 
not look quite so bloodthirsty, and appellate courts can pontificate about the 
murderer's "fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Utah Supreme Court, Elliot Levine "breached his duty of 
loyalty to Holland" and "not only acted directly contrary to Holland's 
interest, but aligned himself with the state's position." (The court, it seems, 
knows what is in Holland's "interest" better than Holland himself.) The court 
did concede that "we are aware that Holland might prefer the death penalty . . 
. . Nevertheless, an attorney is not justified in asserting that his client 
deserves the death penalty, even if his client desires to have that penalty 
imposed." 
</P>
<P>
 Is the public perception of the criminal-justice system strengthened or 
weakened when, consistent with his client's knowing and intelligent choice, an 
attorney lets his guilty client speak the truth? "I am guilty of taking life, 
and I want to die for my crimes."

FAREWELL STORY HAS SAD END; TENNIS: UMPIRE'S CONTROVERSIAL CALL HELPS GROSSMAN 
BEAT NAVRATILOVA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opportunities for seeing Martina Navratilova plying her craft are growing 
fewer by the day as she inches toward retirement at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it was with sorrow and disappointment that she was eliminated from the 
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles on Thursday, a surprisingly early departure for a 
woman who has won the Manhattan Beach tournament eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing both singles and doubles matches Wednesday night, a fatigued 
Navratilova, 37, lost to Ann Grossman in the third round before 3,800 at the 
Manhattan Country Club, 4-6, 7-5, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bitter-sweet parting. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, after all, thought she had won in the second set before Donna 
Ring, the chair umpire, overruled a line call on match point. 
</P>
<P>
 After Grossman had saved one match point with a nice shot down the alley, 
Navratilova hit a deep shot to Grossman's backhand that Grossman could not 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no call from the line judge, and Navratilova thought it was over. 
But Ring motioned that the shot had been out. Navratilova looked at her friends 
sitting nearby, and they indicated it had been good. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fit of anger, she appealed to Ring but the umpire would not budge. All 
the screaming did was upset Navratilova, who seemed to fall apart after that. 
She hit a backhand into the net, then a forehand long as Grossman held serve to 
tie the score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game ended, Navratilova threw her racket underneath the umpire's 
chair, then put a towel over her head and stewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a worse overrule in my life," she said. "And that's pretty 
hard to come back from that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly when she wanted to do anything but play a third set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave it everything I had," she said. "Some people were saying, 'Quit 
pouting, start playing.' I was trying as hard as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman, who reached the third round of all the majors played so far this 
year, was gaining confidence with each dazzling passing shot. She broke 
Navratilova twice to start the third set, and held on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcome with emotion, Grossman, 23, of Grove City, Ohio, was crying as she 
explained the feeling she got from defeating one of the game's legends. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said that after losing to Lindsay Davenport in the third round of the 
Toshiba Classic in Carlsbad last week, she had a vision that she would defeat 
Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
 She told herself, "I'm going to play Martina. This is my only chance." 
</P>
<P>
 But after dropping the first set, it did not seem possible. Grossman, ranked 
46th, seemed ready to self-destruct when she hit a ball into the stands after 
Navratilova had won the set with a sizzling backhand putaway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to put all my anger and emotion (together and) just hit 
something as hard as I could," she said. "The best thing was to knock the ball 
out of here. It felt great." 
</P>
<P>
 It might not have elevated her game, but Grossman started serving better and 
challenging Navratilova in the second set. After she and Navratilova practiced 
on clay last winter, Grossman began to realize that if she could hit with her 
idol, perhaps she could beat her. 
</P>
<P>
 But to defeat Navratilova, Grossman needed to defeat her self-doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes against the top players, I can't let myself go and play," she said. 
"I'm working on trying to find out why I get so scared." 
</P>
<P>
 It started happening against Navratilova, Grossman said, but supporters in the 
stands reminded her, "No fear." 
</P>
<P>
 And ultimately, Grossman became aware of what was happening. She was about to 
eliminate one of the game's legends during her farewell tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martina has such a mystique," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman has none of that.  
</P>
<P>
 Calling herself a boring baseliner, Grossman left her Midwestern farm life at 
18 to embark on a pro career five years ago. She twice reached the fourth round 
of the French Open, where the soft clay is suited to her ground strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has struggled, as her 22-16 record this year indicates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, perhaps that will change. Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Grossman advanced to today's quarterfinals of the Virginia Slims of Los 
Angeles against Zina Garrison-Jackson, who ousted Nathalie Tauziat, 7-5, 1-6, 
6-4. After playing poorly in the second set, Garrison-Jackson rebounded with a 
strong serve. Like Martina Navratilova, Garrison-Jackson said she is tired 
after three consecutive months of playing tennis.

PGA CHAMPIONSHIP HAS FOREIGN FLAVOR; GOLF: MONTGOMERIE OF SCOTLAND AND PRICE OF 
ZIMBABWE HOLD ONE-STROKE ADVANTAGE IN TULSA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to Oklahoma. Introductions may be in order. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-round lead of the PGA Championship is shared by Colin Montgomerie of 
Scotland, who thinks Oklahoma was named after a Broadway musical, and Nick 
Price of Zimbabwe, who thinks an Okie is an old golf club. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, after touring some of the state's finest golfing real estate in 67 
strokes, three under par, Thursday, Montgomerie and Price clearly know quite a 
bit about Oklahoma, or at least about how to play golf in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomerie, who was co-runner-up in the U.S. Open, and Price, the British 
Open champion, are a shot ahead of the closest of 149 other golfers at Southern 
Hills Country Club, where the top scores belonged to some of golf's biggest 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Mickelson, Fred Couples, Ernie Els and Ian Woosnam finished the first 
round at 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples, who was two over par after four holes, shot 32 on the back nine, 
matching the day's best nine-hole score, but that wasn't the most impressive 
thing he did. 
</P>
<P>
 He holed a putt from 25 feet off the green at No. 5, using the nose of his 
putter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use that shot a lot," Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group at 69 is so crowded, it needs a traffic signal. Included in the mass 
of golfers are Fuzzy Zoeller, Loren Roberts, Tom Watson, Lanny Wadkins and 
Raymond Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everyone had trouble figuring out Southern Hills, where the 
fairways are narrow and there is not much rough, but still plenty of challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the greens. They're on the smallish side, about the size of throw 
pillows and nearly as soft. 
</P>
<P>
 The greens were a lot harder when Price finished his round in the early 
evening, but they were just as difficult to putt on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you've probably seen some goofy-looking putts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard greens hold spike marks, so by the time five or six dozen players had 
walked all over them, the greens here had so many marks on them, they looked as 
if they had chicken pox. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're spiking up quite badly," Montgomerie said. "Some are quite fast and 
some are quite slow . . . but they're obviously difficult to hole out." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomerie's round featured three birdies, 15 pars and one mild case of 
sunburn. Actually, it wasn't nearly as hot Thursday as it was at the U.S. Open 
at Oakmont, Pa., where Montgomerie's face and neck turned roughly the color of 
boiled lobster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very pleasant today," he said. "Oakmont wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah, that old Oakmont. It's where Montgomerie shot himself out of a 
playoff with a 78 on the extra day when Els came through and won his first 
major championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't disappointed at all in Oakmont," Montgomerie said. "No one beat me 
over 72 holes. OK, Monday didn't go the way I would like it to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "And obviously it served me in good stead. I finished eighth at the British 
Open and I'm in contention after the first round today. Obviously I'm learning 
something. I don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson said he, too, has learned something about his game since taking some 
time off after missing the cut at the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever he's doing, though, he's keeping it a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it works," he said. "If it does, I'll fill you in." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson shot 33 on the back nine with birdies on the par-five 13th and an 
unlikely one on the 468-yard par-four 16th when he hooked his drive and hit a 
tree, but wound up rolling in a 40-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson also hit a tree at No. 12.  
</P>
<P>
 Watson began his round going the wrong direction. He had two consecutive 
bogeys and could have been excused if he had wanted to disappear beneath his 
wide-brimmed hat. 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't. Instead, he made consecutive birdies on the back side, at Nos. 
14 and 15, with putts of 25 feet and 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The short putts gave him fits, as usual, like the three-footer he missed on 
the par-three No. 8. Watson said the spiked greens made for slow putting 
uphill. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, it might give me a little bit of an advantage with the greens in 
bad shape," Watson said. "Considering my skills on the greens of late." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went at Southern Hills, which played a lot harder than most of the 
golfers had figured it would. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Torrance, another Scot, was frugal but precise with his words in 
appraising Southern Hills. After shooting 69, he was asked if he liked the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far," he said.

MORNING BRIEFING: SILENT DIMAGGIO SILENCES RIVALRY WITH WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare -- and brief -- interview recently with the reclusive Joe DiMaggio, 
the Boston Globe's Peter Gammons talked to the Yankee Clipper about his 
relationship with Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much was made of my rivalry with Ted, and yet I never felt it was really 
there," DiMaggio told Gammons. "There was the rivalry with the Red Sox, and 
frankly, that was what it was about. Winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a few instances together. We talked some at the All-Star games. We 
have spent time together later. But it shouldn't be him against me. That's just 
the way the media construed things. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the greatest left-handed hitter I ever saw. We are different people, 
and I admire him for being the way he's been." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: After hitting 46 home runs and driving in 167 runs his rookie 
season in 1937, what salary was DiMaggio seeking for the 1938 season when he 
held out until April 28? 
</P>
<P>
 London calling: Here's an English perspective on the baseball strike, courtesy 
of Martin Fletcher of the Times of London: 
</P>
<P>
 "Only in the United States would millionaires have the gall to go on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barring a last-minute settlement, America's grossly pampered baseball players 
are planning to put down their bats on Friday because their teams' owners want 
to curb their astronomical salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "In doing so they will cut short one of the most exciting seasons in memory. 
Imagine the outrage if English country cricketers suddenly walked off the field 
in mid-summer and left the championship unfinished." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken for granted: Orlando Magic executive Pat Williams can't imagine why he 
is being criticized for trading guard Scott Skiles, known for his mental 
toughness, in order to make salary-cap room for the signing of free agent 
Horace Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Scott's reputation was a little overblown," Williams said. "Yes, he 
was a tough, feisty guy who would speak his mind, but he was that tough, feisty 
guy as a leader and a starter. When it became apparent this was going to be an 
eight-, nine-, or 10-minutes-a-night job to him, we felt it wasn't fair to him. 
He just can't handle that type of role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll put it to you this way: In effect, we traded Skiles for Grant. Wouldn't 
you make that deal every day of the week?" 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: DiMaggio wanted $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: New York Yankee Don Mattingly on Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken 
Jr.'s streak of 2,000-plus consecutive games: "We wonder how many times he was 
too banged up to go out there, but did anyway. We wonder how many times he had 
a case of the nasty, wake-up-in-the-morning, can't-get-out-of-bed flu, but got 
up, and went to the ballpark, and played. You go around and ask anybody. We're 
all in awe of what he's done." TIM KAWAKAMI

TENNIS; WHEATON GETS SHUNNED, BRUGUERA GETS STUNNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Wheaton, shunned in the main draw of the $1.72 million ATP Championship, 
stunned top-seeded Sergi Bruguera on Thursday night, knocking out the Spanish 
clay-court specialist, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheaton, who had to advance through a local qualifier to get into the 
tournament, was unnerved by Bruguera's fast play, and said he had trouble 
catching his breath on the hot, humid Stadium Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really thought I was in control, like I had it in the bag," Wheaton 
said. "The way he was serving, it was like machine gun fire. Later, he told me 
he was afraid if he slowed down he might get really lethargic." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruguera, the French Open winner who has won three times this year on clay, is 
less comfortable on hard courts. He complained all week of being tired after 
traveling from his tournament victory in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, defending champion Michael Chang and third-seeded Michael Stich had 
their matches interrupted twice by rain before advancing to today's 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-seeded Jim Courier came back from a 1 hour, 23-minute delay to beat 
Sandon Stolle of Australia, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is tough to keep your mind together when you have to go in three times," 
said Stich of Germany, who beat Jim Grabb 6-2, 6-7 (7-4), 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, seeded fourth, beat 13th-seeded Cedric Pioline of France, 6-2, 3-6, 
6-3. On Friday, he will face Jason Stoltenberg of Australia, who beat 
12th-seeded Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, 6-0, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg is 16-3 in his past four tournaments and has moved up to a 
career-high 22nd in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Stefan Edberg ousted MaliVai Washington 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-seeded Boris Becker of Germany fell to Amos Mansdorf of Israel, 7-6 
(7-1), 6-4.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: FOX TROTS OUT STARS, BIG NFL PRODUCTION FOR TIMELY 
DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fox couldn't have planned it any better, what with baseball going on strike 
the same day as its first NFL telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only an exhibition, but Fox is treating tonight's Denver-San Francisco 
game as a major event. It will use 12 cameras, the same number CBS used to 
televise last season's NFC championship game in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hill, the president of Fox Sports, said the network's battle cry going 
into the season is "same game, new attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcers for the 5 p.m. game will be Pat Summerall and John Madden, 
working with their old CBS sidekicks -- producer Bob Stenner and director Sandy 
Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Madden, "This is the most excited I've been for the start of a football 
season since I've been a broadcaster." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sour grapes? ABC's crew might not have been as fired up for the 
Buffalo-Washington game it televised last Monday, but it hardly deserved the 
roasting it got from XTRA's Chet Forte. It was only an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 Forte, on his radio show, said the crew of Al Michaels, Frank Gifford and Dan 
Dierdorf is "getting worse and worse." And, without singling out producer Kenny 
Wolfe by name, said that there really is no producer, that Michaels runs the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was not intended, but Forte, who formerly produced and directed 
"Monday Night Football," came across as bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he thinks that if he slams the telecast, Dennis Swanson, the president 
of ABC sports, will call and say, "Hey, Chet, you're right. All is forgotten, 
please come back and work for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, Chet. Just be glad NBC has hired you to direct NFL telecasts this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Feud fizzles: The feud between XTRA's Jim Rome and Lee Hamilton reached new 
heights -- or rather new depths -- last Friday when Rome called Hamilton all 
kinds of names after saying that Hamilton, quoted here, had lied about Rome 
complaining to station management about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Program director Howard Freedman confirmed that Hamilton had lied about Rome's 
alleged complaining, and said he told both to knock it off. Thank goodness. The 
whole thing was juvenile and unprofessional.  
</P>
<P>
 Others at the station make fun of Hamilton, which is easy to do, but they 
haven't been nearly as vicious as Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Rome: His radio show may have its ups and downs, but his ESPN2 show, 
"Talk2," has been clicking. ESPN2 will show a special one-hour "Best of Talk2" 
Sunday night at 7:30, and ESPN has it in the works to show a monthly "Best of 
Talk2" beginning in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Sunday night's special will be an interview Rome did with paralyzed 
football player Mike Utley, in which the former Detroit Lion talks about not 
sleeping for nine days after his 1992 injury and how it took him 1 1/2 hours to 
open a can of beer. 
</P>

 Rome, on his radio show, got a good comment out of Kansas City Royal Brian 
McRae the other day. McRae, offering a solution for ending the baseball 
impasse, said, "Put the negotiators on a plane with a limited amount of fuel 
and tell them they have to reach an agreement before the fuel runs out."

 Mr. Nice Guy: It was reported here recently that once the sale of Prime Ticket 
was made final, owner Bill Daniels, who sold the regional sports cable network 
to Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI), would distribute $10 million among 15 of 
Prime Ticket's top executives and another $2 million or so among the other 
100-plus employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Such generosity is not uncommon for Daniels. In 1984, he distributed $6 
million among 108 employees after selling Multivision, Ltd., an Anchorage, 
Alaska, cable television system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prime Ticket sale went through last week and the promised bonuses were 
handed out in sealed envelopes at a breakfast for the employees last Saturday 
at the Museum of Flying in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The affair was also a tribute to Daniels, and the love, respect and admiration 
the employees expressed for their outgoing boss was remarkable. There were few 
dry eyes in the place by the time Daniels took the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a hell of a reception for a guy who just sold a company out from 
under you," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, who has had about 50 companies over the years, said, "My philosophy 
has always been to hire the best people possible, then turn 'em loose; stay out 
of their hair but back them to the hilt." 
</P>
<P>
 It worked with Prime Ticket. He and Jerry Buss each put up $5 million to start 
the company in 1985. Daniels, who bought out Buss in 1988, sold the company for 
$220 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an example that the free-enterprise system works," Daniels said. "It 
too often appears to be a screwed-up world we live in, but this function 
exemplifies what makes our nation great." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Prime Ticket: Roger Werner, CEO and president of the regional sports cable 
network, is the only executive leaving the company. The former ESPN president, 
who signed a personal-services contract with Daniels in 1990 and went to Prime 
Ticket in 1992, will continue with Daniels in other ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 During Werner's 18 months at Prime Ticket, it experienced tremendous growth 
and profits increased by more than 400%.

 Recommended listening: Here's a date a lot of readers have been inquiring 
about: The new KMPC will broadcast a 1 1/2-hour tribute to Jim Healy on Aug. 
24. Naturally, it will begin at 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The special will include interviews about Healy and, of course, some of his 
memorable bits. TV-Radio Notes

 A recent study commissioned by the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles 
says women's sports and female athletes are being under-reported by local 
television stations. The study was a follow-up to a similar one in 1989. "This 
new study is intended to measure what, if any, progress has been made in the 
four years following the original report," said Anita DeFrantz, AAF president. 
"Its findings are both encouraging and frustrating." The encouraging part was 
on the network level, she said, the frustrating part on the local level. 
</P>
<P>
 The study concluded that "when a choice was made to focus on a women's event 
or a feature or a story on a marginal but visually entertaining sport," the 
visually appealing sport won. An example cited was a 79-second Channel 7 Sunday 
night piece on nuns playing bikini-clad women in a celebrity volleyball match. 
One thing the local stations could do to improve gender equality would be to 
hire female sportscasters. There are none on any of the major Los Angeles 
stations. One obvious candidate is Ann Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers and Bill Macdonald will serve as co-hosts of a one-hour special, 
"California Special Olympics Summer Games," on Prime Ticket Sunday night at 6. 
Prime Ticket's Special Olympic coverage in 1992 won an Emmy Award. . . . 
Richard Brown, the president of the Angels, and baseball agent Dennis Gilbert 
will be Alan Massengale's guests on Prime Ticket's "Press Box" tonight.

 With Pat Summerall now at Fox, Jim Nantz is anchoring his first major golf 
tournament for CBS this week with the PGA Championship at Southern Hills 
Country Club in Tulsa, Okla. Nantz, who has been with CBS since 1985, has 
anchored 15 golf tournaments but never a major. "You cover a major championship 
differently because there are a lot of fringe fans who just watch the Grand 
Slam events," Nantz said. . . . TBS, besides carrying the first and second 
rounds of the PGA Championship, will offer two hours of early-morning coverage 
Saturday and Sunday, 8-10 a.m. . . . To help fill the baseball void, KABC radio 
is planning to carry games between the Albuquerque Dukes, the Dodgers' triple-A 
club, and the Vancouver Canadians, the Angels' triple-A club, Saturday at 6 
p.m. and Sunday at noon.

 Chick Hearn is one of seven nominees for induction into the American 
Sportscasters Assn. Hall of Fame. The others are Charlie Jones, Keith Jackson, 
Chris Schenkel, Pat Summerall, former Green Bay Packer announcer Ray Scott and 
Chuck Thompson of Baltimore Oriole fame. The winner or winners will be 
announced next month. Vin Scully was the lone inductee in 1992. Howard Cosell 
and Marty Glickman made it last year. The hall is in its 10th year.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; BATES CAUTIOUS WITH THIGH INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Safety Patrick Bates, the Raiders' No. 1 pick last year, sat out Thursday's 
afternoon practice because of a thigh muscle injury, which forced him to miss 
the final three games last season. Coach Art Shell says the injury is not 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates is expected to get more playing time this season and Shell said, "I 
don't think missing a day to rest here and there will hurt his progress because 
he's been in camp since (July 10)."  
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, cornerback Torin Dorn and linebacker 
Brian Jones also did not practice because of nagging injuries and are 
questionable for Saturday's exhibition game at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's common for teams to downplay the importance of winning exhibitions but 
the Raider regular-season success often matches their pre-September record. 
</P>
<P>
 Since their first season in 1960, the Raiders have finished exhibition play 
with only one loss six times and have either won the Super Bowl or reached the 
AFC championship game in five of the six following regular seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 2-0 record going into the Steeler game, the Raiders will have a chance 
to win their first three exhibitions for the first time since 1976. They ended 
up with a 13-1 regular-season record that year and went on to defeat Minnesota 
in Super Bowl XI. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will leave today for Pittsburgh after a morning workout at their 
Oxnard training camp site. They will return to Oxnard from Pittsburgh, then 
return to their El Segundo headquarters next Thursday. LONNIE WHITE

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; RAM CORNERBACKS DRAWING INTEREST 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers will have a scout at Saturday night's exhibition game 
with the Patriots to look over the Ram cornerbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers lack a solid No. 3 cornerback and the Rams appear overloaded with 
Darryl Henley, Robert Bailey, Terry Taylor and Wymon Henderson supporting 
starters Todd Lyght and Steve Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' defensive coaching staff might find it difficult to part with a 
cornerback because of their experiences last year, when a rash of injuries left 
them playing with guys off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the team's front office is looking ahead to the final cut-down to 53, 
and its ramifications on the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are also trying to deal a veteran wide receiver and a running back. 
Veteran wide receivers' Jessie Hester and Greg McMurtry are longshots to make 
the final roster. And veteran Nate Lewis, who is working as a starter and is 
one of the better paid players on offense, might have trouble holding his spot 
with the emergence of Isaac Bruce, the team's second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Cleveland Gary, who was the subject of trade talks a year ago, is 
not expected to be on the market. Although Johnny Bailey has emerged as the 
team's third-down running back, Gary's first- and second-down services are 
required as insurance because of the team's overwhelming reliance on Jerome 
Bettis. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Darryl Ashmore, who used Deral Boykin's helmet to bop Boykin 
in the head, apologized at a meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Boykin needed six stitches in his head and missed both of Thursday's 
practices. He is expected to return to work today. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox would not say if Ashmore will be fined but he told the 
players further such incidents will result in fines of $5,000. T.J. SIMERS

 The Philadelphia Eagles have contacted the agent for free agent 
cornerback-kick returner Deion Sanders, according to a published report in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, a two-sport star expected to have his baseball season cut short by a 
players' strike beginning today, and his agent, Eugene Parker, talked with 
Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie last Friday, unidentified sources told the 
Philadelphia Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources in Cincinnati said Sanders, 27, would be open to the possibility of 
signing with the Eagles immediately. If the strike ended, Sanders would join 
the Eagles when the Reds' season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles are believed to have little flexibility under the salary cap and 
would probably have to cut a few players to sign him. 
</P>

<P>
 Growing impatient with holdout kicker Gary Anderson's absence, Pittsburgh 
Steelers Coach Bill Cowher suggested that he is nearly ready to go looking for 
some fresh legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, that could be addressed," Cowher said in West Chester, Pa. "No question 
we're looking and keeping our eyes open to any potential kickers out there. 
It's a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, 35, in the final year of a contract worth $350,000, refused to 
report to camp last month after claiming the Steelers reneged on the promise of 
a new contract. . . . Coach Norv Turner and about half the Washington Redskins 
will make their home-field debut tonight at RFK Stadium against Joe Montana and 
the Kansas City Chiefs. The game will also be the first at home for rookie 
quarterback Heath Shuler, who will play the second half. Both Turner and Kansas 
City Coach Marty Schottenheimer said they'll play their starters for the first 
half before turning the game over to second-and third-teamers. Montana will 
start for the Chiefs, his first start of the exhibition season. "I think Joe's 
right on target as far as where we are with him at this time," Schottenheimer 
said. . . . Green Bay star receiver Sterling Sharpe, practicing this week for 
the first time since sustaining a severe turf toe last Nov. 8, will not play 
this week and will not practice full-speed until the final week of August 
before playing in the final exhibition against New England, Coach Mike Holmgren 
said.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; A TRIP TO DETROIT ENDS IN ONTARIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The two empty buses pulled into the Anaheim Stadium parking lot at 9:40 
Thursday night, and the Angel clubhouse attendants began loading all of the 
equipment and uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything was loaded, the Angels were set to go, and they began to board. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann, the six-man coaching staff, the two 
trainers, the traveling secretary, the equipment manager and the public 
relations man. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was not a single player. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter. The itinerary called for the bus to pull out at 10:30 p.m. 
and go to Ontario Airport for an 11:30 p.m. charter flight to Detroit and a 
three-game series against the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels followed the timetable . . . until they realized it was not 
necessary to board, watching the charter leave without them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just following our itinerary," General Manager Bill Bavasi said. "We 
figured if they didn't show up for the plane, the strike was on. But we wanted 
them to establish that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was academic, but if there was a last-second postponement, we 
didn't want the Tigers to say, 'Where are you guys?' "We told (everyone) not to 
pack a lot. Bobby Knoop was the only one to pack a full suitcase, but that's 
because he's going home to Arizona." BOB NIGHTENGALE

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GRIFFEY HELPS MARINERS FRUSTRATE A'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On major league baseball's final bow before the strike, Ken Griffey Jr. showed 
fans all they'll be missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey hit a grand slam and made a spectacular catch to help the Seattle 
Mariners defeat the Oakland A's, 8-1, at Oakland, preventing the A's from 
pulling even with the idle Texas Rangers atop the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey's 40th homer highlighted a six-run second inning and gave the Mariners 
their fifth consecutive victory. Randy Johnson (13-6) took care of the rest, 
pitching a four-hitter and had 15 strikeouts to enter the work stoppage leading 
the majors with 204. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scattered boos were heard when Johnson struck out Ernie Young for the 
final out at 9:45 p.m. PDT. Johnson waved to the crowd as he left the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Mariners, the strike meant going home for the first time since July 
19, when ceiling tiles fell from the Kingdome roof and sent the team packing 
for the next 20 games. They finished the trip 11-9 to move within two games of 
the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance ticket sales for the final game were only about 17,000, but 26,808 
showed up to see the two teams usher in the strike. Signs protesting the work 
action -- "Stupid Is As Stupid Does" and "Will Play For Food" -- abounded, but 
there were nearly as many banners heralding Griffey. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 8, New York 7 -- Ed Sprague, who drove in the Blue Jays' first two 
runs with a triple, opened the 13th with a home run at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Carter of the Blue Jays, who ended last season with a World Series-winning 
home run, nearly finished this one with another homer. He led off the 12th with 
his 27th home run, but the Yankees weren't finished. They tied the score when 
Luis Polonia opened the 12th with a double, moved up on a single by Wade Boggs 
and scored on a double-play grounder by Paul O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague's 11th home run of the season beat Joe Ausanio (2-1), who was sent to 
triple-A Columbus after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 10, Detroit 5 -- The Brewers scored six runs in the eighth inning at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 On another day, the game might have been called. But no one wanted a rainout 
on the eve of a walkout. So, the Brewers and Tigers spent nearly three hours 
playing cards and eating doughnuts while the start of the game was delayed 
because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee scored six runs in the eighth on five hits, including Jody Reed's 
two-run double, two errors and a wild pitch.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ASTROS SQUANDER THEIR CHANCE 
</P>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Houston Astros lost their chance to take the Central lead on the last day 
before the strike deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros, playing their first game since Jeff Bagwell broke a bone in his 
left hand, fell to the San Diego Padres on Thursday at Houston, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
 They remained one-half game behind the Cincinnati Reds, who lost to the 
Dodgers, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. did their job and we came up short," Astro Manager Terry Collins said. 
"We had to win this game and we didn't. But we're staying positive. I still 
believe this race will be decided the final week of the season when we play the 
Reds here in the Astrodome." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Bass' three-run homer in the seventh inning got the Astros close, but 
they fell short. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell will be sidelined three to five weeks after breaking his hand when he 
was hit by a pitch from Andy Benes on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn, trying to become baseball's first .400 hitter since Ted Williams 
hit .406 in 1941, went three for five and raised his average to .394. He needed 
a six-for-six performance to reach .400. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I'm not done for the year," Gwynn said. "I hope I get a chance to add 
those six extra points to my average." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 13, Colorado 0 -- Greg Maddux pitched a three-hit shutout in what 
might have been the last baseball game at Mile High Stadium in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies, who will move to Coors Field next April, drew 65,043 to raise 
their major league-leading total to 3,281,511. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred McGriff hit his 34th homer and David Justice hit his 19th and had four 
RBIs for the Braves, who had 20 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux (16-6), trying to become the first pitcher to win three consecutive Cy 
Young awards, lowered his major league-leading earned-run average to 1.56. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, Montreal 0 -- Zane Smith, who hadn't won since July 6, shut down 
the Expos on five hits at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith (10-8) didn't resemble the pitcher who hadn't won in six starts, 
retiring 21 hitters on ground balls. He didn't strike out a batter but walked 
only two. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Van Slyke, in the final year of his contract, had a run-scoring single in 
possibly his last game for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 2, New York 1 -- Only about 5,000 of a crowd of 37,605 were left 
at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia when Billy Hatcher scored the winning run 
on Ricky Jordan's single in the bottom of the 15th inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatcher opened the inning with a bunt single and moved to third on a wild 
pitch by Mauro Gozzo (3-5) and Kevin Stocker's flyout. Pinch-hitter John Kruk 
and Lenny Dykstra were intentionally walked and, one out later, Jordan singled 
down the third-base line. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 8, Florida 6 -- Tom Pagnozzi hit a home run for the third 
consecutive game and teammates Mark Whiten, Ray Lankford and Bernard Gilkey 
also homered for the Cardinals at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was called in the top of the eighth inning after a 79-minute rain 
delay.

DEL MAR; BERTRANDO WILL RUN THE SAME NO MATTER WHAT OWNER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "John (Shirreffs) is a low-key guy," Eddie Nahem was saying. "He doesn't like 
the limelight." 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, Shirreffs is with the wrong horse if he plans to blend in with 
the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the other, he's with the right owner, because if Bertrando should 
repeat as the winner of the $1-million Pacific Classic here Saturday, there 
will be only one speech maker. Nahem will say enough to cover both his trainer 
and his partner, Marshall Naify. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bertrando had won the Wickerr Stakes here on July 28, he interrupted his 
winner's-circle speech by beckoning the 73-year-old Naify, who was far in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait a minute," Nahem said. "Let's get the other owner over here." 
</P>
<P>
 Naify, a small, soft-spoken man, made a few hesitant steps in Nahem's 
direction. Then Nahem continued talking, nonstop, about Bertrando. Naify might 
have been in the picture, but he was still out of the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirreffs and Naify are opposites of the ebullient Nahem, and this may be the 
right mix for the group that runs Bertrando. Of the 5-year-old horse's previous 
two trainers, Bruce Headley was too much of a horseman to be along for the 
ride, and Bobby Frankel, a New Yorker like Nahem and just as opinionated, 
couldn't countenance the scheme of sending Bertrando to stud this year and then 
bringing him back to the races. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando, however, would probably run the same if he were racing for the 
Three Stooges. In all but one of his 17 starts -- the first race he ever ran -- 
he has been in front at the first call. Seven of his eight victories have been 
wire to wire. John and Betty Mabee, who own Best Pal, Saturday's 2-1 
morning-line favorite, are also running another fast horse, Dramatic Gold, 
whose job may be to soften up Bertrando if he can. 
</P>

 "I guess that's what they hope to do," Nahem said. "But it won't be the first 
time there's a big race and somebody threw a rabbit in there. And this one's 
for a million dollars. I still think we'll be in front going into the first 
turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Averaging almost $180,000 a start, Bertrando has earned $3 million and an 
Eclipse Award. He had enough earlier achievements to be voted best older horse 
last year, even though Arcangues out-finished him by two lengths in the 
Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal has earned $4.7 million and has yet to win an Eclipse, having been 
beaten in his closest shot by Pleasant Tap for best older horse in 1992, 
154-115. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando's career started at Del Mar, not far from where Nahem and the 
multimillionaire Naify live, and he's unbeaten at the seaside track, having won 
three races on dirt before the Wickerr. His maiden victory, in his first start 
on Aug. 25, 1991, marked the only time he was headed by another horse before 
winning, and less than three weeks later, after he was supplemented for 
$10,000, he won the Del Mar Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando didn't run at Del Mar again until last year, when he won the Pacific 
Classic in 1:59 2/5, chopping two-fifths of a second off the track record that 
Best Pal set two years before when he won the first Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahem bred Bertrando, through a mating of Breeders' Cup Classic winner 
Skywalker and Gentle Hands, a mare that Nahem claimed after a 1982 race for 
$50,000. Gentle Hands, who died in 1991, won two races and earned $40,000. At 
the outset of Bertrando's career, Bruce Headley's teen-age son, Gus, was listed 
as one of Bertrando's owners. After Headley was dropped as trainer, in October 
of 1992, there were some behind-the-scenes legal negotiations that prevented an 
ownership issue from going to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Saturday's contenders are going into the Pacific Classic off only one 
prep race, Best Pal having won at seven furlongs at Hollywood Park on July 22 
and Bertrando at a mile on grass in the Wickerr. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, Best Pal would seem to have the fitness edge for running 1 
1/4 miles. His trainer, Richard Mandella, was giving him mile workouts before 
he ran, and Best Pal also ran a couple of races this winter at Santa Anita, 
while Bertrando, after recovering from arthroscopic surgery for a chipped knee, 
was spending his time at River Edge Farm near Buellton, getting 58 mares in 
foal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we've got enough (conditioning) underneath him," Nahem said. "They 
did a good job with him at the farm, and they started galloping him six days a 
week when it was almost time to get back into training. He had had many slow 
gallops by the time I got him the middle of May." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirreffs, who was trainer Bill Spawr's off-track trainer and who also worked 
for Brian Mayberry, might be the trainer of record, but when Bertrando goes to 
the post Saturday, he will have Nahem's fingerprints all over him. When Nahem 
announced that Frankel was out, the co-owner said that he would take over 
Bertrando's training, and now he's disappointed that his license hasn't been 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he has passed the trainer's test, and suggests that the stewards 
are dragging their feet. But he won't say anything more about the matter until 
after Saturday's race. A quiet Eddie Nahem is something to see. Horse Racing 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal and Alysheba are the only horses to win three races worth $1 million 
or more. Alysheba's victories were in the $1-million Super Derby at Louisiana 
Downs in 1987 and the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap and the $3-million 
Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs, both in 1988. . . . Laffit Pincay, 
who has 13 wins in $1-million races, more than any other jockey, rides 15-1 
Stuka in the Pacific Classic. . . . Gary Baze, a recent addition to the Del Mar 
riding colony, has the assignment on Risen Roman, who has never run on dirt and 
is winless since a victory in France in March. Baze, the brother-in-law of Gary 
Stevens, rode at Del Mar in 1987 and won stakes with Miss Alto and Bold Second. 
</P>
<P>
 Embroidered, who was 65-1 when she ran second to Serena's Song in the 
Landaluce Stakes at Hollywood Park, hooks up with trainer Wayne Lukas' 
2-year-old filly again in today's Sorrento. . . . In another race on the 
Pacific Classic card Saturday, Magical Maiden makes her 1994 debut in the 
$100,000 Rancho Bernardo Breeders' Cup Handicap. Magical Maiden, seventh in the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff in November, is the high weight at 120 pounds in the 6 
1/2-furlong race. She won two stakes at Del Mar last year. . . . Lure, whose 
only two losses this year came against Paradise Creek, gets another chance 
today in the $100,000 Bernard Baruch Handicap at 1 1/8 miles at Saratoga. 
Paradise Creek is undefeated in six starts this year and will carry 126 pounds, 
one more than Lure.

 LET'S BE FRIENDS: In past years, the bordering cities of Orange and Villa Park 
have occasionally had jurisdictional disputes. Some longtime Villa Park 
residents won't have anything to do with the big city adjoining them. But now 
Villa Park is considering a contract with the Orange Fire Department for its 
fire protection (B2). . . . Says Villa Park Councilman Joseph S. Barsa, urging 
that old enmities be forgotten: "Even the two worst enemies, the Arabs and 
Israelis, are now making peace."

that sells minor league baseball items, mainly caps. . . . If you want a cap 
for the Fort Wayne Wizards, for example, or the Capital City Bombers, she's got 
them. Regarding the strike, says Durell: "There's no doubt a strike will 
increase interest in minor league ball. It will be the only game in town."

 DOWNHILL RACERS? Today's baseball strike may seem a relief to some 
disappointed California Angels fans. The team is 21 games under .500 baseball 
(47-68) and in last place in the American League West division. . . . How was 
the team doing when Buck Rodgers was fired as Angels manager on May 17? It was 
seven games below .500 then, and in second place, two games behind division 
leader Texas.

VOTE ON CRIME BILL IS BLOCKED; MAJOR SETBACK FOR CLINTON; LEGISLATION: NARROW 
225-210 DEFEAT ON PROCEDURAL RULE IN HOUSE MAY KILL $33.2-BILLION MEASURE FOR 
YEAR. PRESIDENT DENOUNCES GOP AND GUN-CONTROL OPPONENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An alliance of GOP lawmakers and Democratic gun-control opponents successfully 
blocked the House from voting on the long-stalled crime bill Thursday, dealing 
a major blow to the Clinton Administration and throwing the future of the 
massive $33.2-billion anti-crime initiative into grave doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans cast the narrow 225-210 defeat of a technical rule as an 
opportunity to redraft the bill to make it even tougher on crime. But Democrats 
said that the measure is now virtually dead for the year because no substitute 
is likely to pass the House without the provisions that Republicans oppose -- a 
ban on assault weapons and funding for after-hours school programs to keep 
violence-prone youngsters off the streets at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the vote, President Clinton denounced lawmakers on television 
for having "failed the American people." He blamed Republicans and the gun 
lobby for defeating the bill on a "procedural trick" and demanded that Congress 
remain in session throughout a summer recess that is scheduled to begin next 
week, to vote again on a crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to come back tomorrow and the day after that . . . and to keep 
coming back until we give the American people the essential elements of this 
crime bill," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), who voted for the assault 
weapons ban when it was passed by the House earlier this year, said the final 
product that emerged from a House-Senate conference was an "unholy trinity of 
pork, posturing and partisanship." 
</P>
<P>
 With Clinton's health care initiative also in trouble, the effective defeat of 
the crime bill on a procedural motion meant that the Democrats who control 
Congress may have to face angry voters in November with few legislative 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing the crime bill vote "is a very, very serious blow to the President," 
said political analyst William Schneider. Because the crime bill addressed an 
issue that voters consistently rate as their top concern going into the 
November elections, Clinton's defeat is likely to reinforce the growing 
perception that the President is a "weak and ineffectual leader who cannot 
deliver on his promises," Schneider added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's prospects for reviving the bill rest on hopes that the 
public, which polls have shown strongly supports the measure, will rise up in 
anger against the House vote and force enough members of Congress to change 
their minds to get the bill through. "I think people will have trouble saying 
they didn't bring home a crime bill because the NRA told them not to," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of stirring that anger, Clinton hastily added a crime-related event 
to his schedule for today. Dropping plans to swear in Steven G. Breyer as a 
Supreme Court justice, Clinton will fly, instead, to Minneapolis to speak to 
the National Assn. of Police Organizations, which is meeting there. Vice 
President Al Gore will handle the Breyer swearing-in. But as they struggled to 
come to terms with the magnitude of their defeat, despondent Democrats were 
skeptical that another crime bill could be enacted in a Congress already 
preoccupied with trying to save the President's foundering health care 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's criminal what happened," sobbed Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.) as 
she emerged from a Democratic leadership meeting with tears streaming down her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 The grim, stunned looks on the faces of Clinton's allies confirmed that they 
shared her assessment as a coalition of Republicans and conservative rural 
Democrats opposed to gun control measures defeated -- by a margin that was 
considerably larger than expected -- a technical motion that had to be approved 
for the crime bill to come up for final passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats generally avoided criticism of their fellow party members who voted 
against the bill. Clinton, when asked about the 58 defecting Democrats, 
sidestepped the issue, focusing his ire instead on Republicans who had voted 
previously for the assault weapons ban but voted against the bill Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake, both sides waged one of the fiercest lobbying campaigns 
in recent memory in the days leading up the vote, with Clinton making a series 
of last-minute appeals to wavering lawmakers on a telephone line that the White 
House kept open to the Democratic cloakroom. White House Chief of Staff Leon E. 
Panetta met personally with lawmakers throughout the day. And as the vote 
approached, he and other senior Administration officials predicted that the 
outcome would be extremely close -- decided by no more than two or three 
uncommitted Democratic votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 15-vote margin by which the procedural motion lost was a double blow 
to the bill's supporters because it underscored the Democratic leadership's 
failure to keep its own troops in line on an issue that directly affected the 
President's prestige and is likely to resonate loudly at the polls in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this vote was important for the Administration, it was critical for 
members of Congress," agreed Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. "Incumbents are 
looking at tough times this year and the only way for them to run is on a 
platform of accomplishments." But with health care reform in trouble and the 
crime bill now thrown into legislative limbo, it looks increasingly unlikely 
that Congress will be able to deliver any major accomplishments this year, 
Mellman added. 
</P>
<P>
 Before their defeat, Democratic leaders said that they needed at least 10 
Republican votes to offset the defection of anti-gun control Democrats and to 
prevail on the motion that would have cleared the way for the crime bill's 
then-certain passage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they got 11 Republican votes but they were not enough to offset 
the much larger than expected defection of 58 Democratic supporters of the 
National Rifle Assn. and other gun lobby groups that teamed up with the House 
GOP leadership to wage a fierce campaign against the bill because of a 
provision that would have imposed a 10-year ban on the manufacture and sale of 
19 assault-type weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a larger backlash from the NRA Democrats than we anticipated," said 
Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, one of the Republicans who supported the 
bill. "I am just stunned at what happened," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people were squeezed" by two forces, "the Republican Party and 
the NRA," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a leading sponsor of the bill 
who denounced the outcome as "despicable." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's vote promises to be a major issue in California's U.S. Senate race, 
where crime has already dominated the campaign debate. After the vote, 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein sharply criticized her Republican rival, Rep. 
Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), for voting with the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill is literally hundreds of additional police officers in Los Angeles 
that Mr. Huffington just turned his back on," Feinstein said in a press 
conference. "California is deeply troubled by crime and violence, by gangs and 
by drugs. So the people are going to have to speak and the way they have to 
speak is with their vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, the Senate author of the assault weapons ban, said she was hopeful 
that the bill could be salvaged. "Let's not dwell in defeat until the battle is 
really over," she said. "The battle is not over." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who voted to support an earlier version of the crime bill last 
April, said that he joined the opposition Thursday because of the legislation's 
crime prevention package. 
</P>
<P>
 "America does not need a spending bill that creates new welfare programs," he 
said. "I know that if the conferees work on a bipartisan basis and report out a 
better bill we can pass good, tough crime legislation this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton urged Congress to rescue the main components of the bill by voting 
over again. The sweeping crime bill was to have made good on one of Clinton's 
main campaign promises to provide the funds to put another 100,000 police 
officers on the streets of American cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Its broad mix of crime protection and prevention measures also included $7.4 
billion for new community programs designed to dissuade youngsters from joining 
street gangs by providing them with after-hours sports and cultural activities 
at public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Its main crime protection components would have expanded the death penalty to 
cover more than 50 federal offenses, provided nearly $9 billion in matching 
grants for new prison construction and mandated sentences of life imprisonment 
for three-time convicted felons -- the so-called "three strikes and you're out" 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the programs, funded over a six-year period, would have been financed 
by a special trust fund fed by the savings that are expected to accrue from a 
plan to cut the federal bureaucracy by more than 250,000 workers over the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest proportion of funding -- about two-thirds of the $33.2-billion 
total -- would have gone to law enforcement agencies, including $8.8 billion to 
help state and local governments hire 100,000 more police for street beats and 
community policing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the expanded provisions for capital punishment, the death penalty would 
have been extended to include such crimes as drive-by murders, car-jacking 
slayings and major drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the bill contained many features that both Democrats and Republicans 
had sought -- and which lawmakers from both parties said their constituents 
wanted -- the Republicans complained that the bill was larded with too many 
wasteful pork-barrel projects inserted in conference to win members' votes, 
citing a $10-million grant that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks 
(D-Tex.) inserted for his alma mater, Lamar University. 
</P>
<P>
 They also derided much of the spending included under the crime prevention 
provisions of the bill, saying that it amounted to little more than a thinly 
disguised attempt to re-wrap some of the social projects that Clinton was 
forced by congressional opposition to remove from his economic stimulus package 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our children don't need more midnight basketball. Our children don't need 
more arts and crafts. . . . Our children need more law enforcement," declared 
Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans who supported the bill, however, said that wasteful spending had 
nothing to do with their GOP colleagues' real objections to the package. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NRA and the assault weapons ban -- that was the stealth issue here and it 
had nothing to do with pork," Roukema said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Shays, the Connecticut Republican who led the effort to round 
up GOP support for the bill, added that opposition by the NRA and political 
strong-arm tactics by the Republican National Committee in the end sent his 
colleagues "running for their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 In a not-so-subtle threat, the committee sent all 38 Republicans who had voted 
for the assault weapons ban last May a copy of a resolution adopted in the wake 
of that vote by the Republican Party in Alaska, which called on the Republican 
committee to oppose the maverick Republicans' reelection efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Shays said that GOP operatives also called the district offices of the 
Republican weapons ban supporters to tell them that Republicans would not vote 
for them in November if they supported the crime bill rule. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Shays said the "pressure was so intense" that he all but abandoned 
his efforts to get fellow Republicans to vote for the rule, saying it was all 
he could do "just to get to the floor alive to cast my own vote." House Vote on

 Source: Associated Press Bill's Key Points 
</P>
<P>
 The $33.2-billion crime bill blocked Thursday by the House would have 
authorized: 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending $11.1 billion for state and local police, including $8.9 billion to 
help hire 100,000 new law enforcement officers to carry out community policing 
by learning about neighborhoods in an effort to prevent crime as well as catch 
lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tossing third-time violent and drug felons in prison for life if the third 
conviction is in federal court, but allowing the release of some over 70 after 
they served 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending $10.5 billion for prisons, including $8.7 billion for state prisons 
and $1.8 billion to reimburse states for incarcerating criminal illegal 
immigrants. Recipient states would have had to keep prisoners incarcerated for 
85% of their terms or make strides toward that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banning 19 named types of assault-style firearms and scores of others deemed 
by the government to meet assault-style characteristics. It would have limited 
magazine capacity to 10 rounds. It would have exempted 650 named firearms and 
all guns legally owned when the law took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending $7.6 billion for crime prevention programs and $1.3 billion for 
drug courts. The prevention money would have included $1.8 billion for the 
Violence Against Women Act, including money for shelters, and $1.8 billion for 
flexible Local Partnership Act grants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowing some nonviolent, first-time drug offenders to avoid mandatory 
minimum 5- and 10-year federal penalties. It would have been retroactive for 
people now in prison, and Justice Department officials believe 5,000 prisoners 
might have been eligible. The "safety valve" would have been limited to those 
who used no gun or threat of violence, were not organizers and never served 
more than 90 days for another crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating more than 50 new federal death penalty crimes. Many carried that 
penalty before the Supreme Court overturned capital punishment in 1972. But 
some would have been new, including car-jacking slayings, drive-by shooting 
murders and major drug-traffickers, even those not directly connected to any 
specific death.

 OUT OF PLAY: The fans aren't the only victims of the baseball strike. Some 
businesses (D1), such as Jas. D. Easton Inc. in Van Nuys, might also find 
themselves in a foul mood. Even though sales of Easton's aluminum bats won't be 
hurt -- major leaguers don't use them -- the company sells wrist bands, gloves 
and other items to the pros. . . . The strike also is a threat, says Easton's 
Jim Darby, because "it will turn people off to the game of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 PLAY BALL: No pros? Try Northridge, where they've got a team that could make 
the Little League World Series. The local boys face Alaska today in the Western 
Regional in San Bernardino (C13). . . . The last Valley team to win the Series 
was Granada Hills in 1963.

 LIGHT UP: Roz Gordon (above) is one of many local cigar lovers who aren't just 
blowing smoke these days. At clubs or dinners, they have found a way to get 
around all the anti-smoking sentiment in the air and make friends who share 
their passion. . . . "I used to smoke about five cigars a day, but now I'm down 
to one because I'm so limited in where I can smoke," said Ken Draper of North 
Hollywood. See Valley Life! Page 30. 
</P>
<P>
 DON'T LIGHT UP: Cigars, cigarettes -- it doesn't matter to Herm Perlmutter of 
the American Cancer Society's San Fernando Valley Unit. He's against smoking in 
public, period. His latest concern is Prop. 188, which would overturn smoke 
free ordinances (B3). . . . In the 1970s, Perlmutter helped persuade a Sizzler 
in Sherman Oaks to designate a nonsmoking section, one of the first in a 
restaurant anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 FALL FASHION: Nehru is back. No, not the ex-Indian prime minister. The 
jackets, of course. You know, the ones with the stand-up collar that were big 
in the '70s. . . . For women, it's time to go conservative with knee-length 
skirts. "They are classic and will always be in fashion," said Kathryn Kostenly 
of Woodland Hills. See Valley Life! Page 29.

 Workers for Vintage Petroleum ignored nearby safety equipment that could have 
saved their lives, because they saw no threat of deadly fumes in the 
long-dormant well they were reactivating, company officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous checks of the well showed no traces of hydrogen sulfide, the 
colorless toxic gas that killed three workers and injured four others in an 
industrial accident at a Rincon oil lease 10 miles north of Ventura two days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one involved in this operation thought it necessary," said Robert W. Cox, 
vice president of Vintage Petroleum. "No (hydrogen sulfide) gas was expected to 
be encountered." 
</P>
<P>
 All seven dead and injured oil field workers were exposed to a small 
concentration of hydrogen sulfide, a common toxic gas that exists in pockets of 
underground crude oil, rescue officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew members failed to use three common safety tools that could have 
limited the disaster, oil company officials said. The workers were not using 
breathing devices, continuous monitors to alert them to the gas or harnesses 
that would have allowed a quicker escape from the cellar in which they were 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these employees had been wearing breathing apparatuses, it is possible 
they would not have been killed," Cox said. "But you can't take that conclusion 
and work back and say there were obvious mistakes made." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the workers also apparently violated company safety rules by 
attempting to rescue their colleagues, Cox said. Guidelines call for employees 
to retreat immediately from poisonous gas and summon help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's human nature to want to go to the aid of a co-worker," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed Wednesday were three young oil field workers -- Ronald Johnson and 
Jason Hoskins of Ventura and Sean David Harris of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition of the four injured workers improved Thursday, with Jeff 
Sandoval and Toby Thrower being released from the hospital. Derek Abbott and 
Jerry Walker remained in Los Robles Hospital in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Operations have been suspended at the oil well where the workers died. But Cox 
said business is going on around the clock at the firm's other sites nearby. No 
additional safety measures have been implemented since Wednesday's tragedy, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A regional manager of Pride Petroleum, which had contracted with Vintage to 
help convert the oil well to a water-injection line, said his workers used a 
hand-held detector to check for hydrogen sulfide hours before the accident. But 
manager Michael Furrow said it was not turned on when the gas leaked. 
</P>
<P>
 Furrow, who said he spent most of Thursday with family members of those who 
died, said the gases came without warning despite the crew's safety efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time they were sniffing, there was not anything flowing into the 
cellar," Furrow said. "Whatever the gas was that killed our employees was not 
present when the monitor was on." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at both Vintage and Pride Petroleum said Thursday that it would be 
premature to conclude that it was hydrogen sulfide that killed the men. But 
they offered no other explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Furrow said he could not explain why his workers failed to hook themselves 
into full-body harnesses that colleagues can use to pull them to safety in 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's standard Pride policy and it's Cal-OSHA policy," Furrow said. "Before 
the first man went in, he should have had a full-body harness on, and there 
should have been someone there at the ready to pull him out." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, or Cal-OSHA, declined to discuss any findings of their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, inspectors would not comment on the workers' failure to use 
respirators, monitors or harnesses. But one official said Thursday that safety 
laws are subject to varied interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no requirement that every employee always wear a respirator," said 
Gene Glendenning, a Cal-OSHA safety expert based in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're only required to wear a respirator when there's an exposure or 
potential exposure," he said. "What we require is appropriate monitoring for 
the hazardous material involved." 
</P>
<P>
 John Duncan, another Cal-OSHA regulator, said the oil company seemed to be 
taking a strong defensive stand in declaring that no toxic gas detectors or 
respirators were needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to make such a definitive judgment as to whether the proper 
safety procedures were followed," Duncan said. "This is one of the main issues 
we will be investigating." 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan chastised Cox for continuing to pump oil at other sites without 
instituting extra safety precautions, such as more use of respirators and 
monitoring sensors, even if they are not required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 State inspectors have descended upon Vintage's Rincon field to review the 
company's safety record and find out if it adequately protected workers from 
toxic fumes as a matter of routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Pride Petroleum is also being investigated for potential violations of state 
safety laws. The contracting firm already had a questionable safety record, 
suffering two fatal accidents and at least 10 other work-related injuries that 
resulted in hospital stays since 1990, Cal-OSHA records show. The company also 
has several citations and fines totaling more than $10,000 over the last four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly not a good record," Duncan said. "They've had a history of some 
problems and it should be a source of concern. They clearly should do better." 
</P>
<P>
 But Furrow defended his Texas-based firm's safety record, saying it spends 
about $4 million a year on training. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pride Petroleum incident rate is just under seven per 200,000 man-hours of 
work in the last 12 months, a rate Furrow said was well within industry 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some record of hydrogen sulfide in the vicinity of the Rincon well, 
according to maps kept by the State Division of Oil and Gas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most recent public map is 18 years old and compiled strictly from 
information provided by oil industry sources themselves, said Pamela Morris of 
the Division of Oil and Gas, which regulates lease operations in California. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1976 map, the concentration of hydrogen sulfide is about 100 
parts per million in the areas around the Rincon lease. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, known hydrogen sulfide deposits in some oil fields in Santa 
Barbara County top 270,000 parts per million, a ratio that makes drilling in 
that area far more dangerous, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the concentration of hydrogen sulfide must reach 700 or more parts 
per million to be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators said Vintage Petroleum executives could be found liable 
for civil and criminal violations of health and safety codes designed to 
protect oil workers from hydrogen sulfide and other industry hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal-OSHA requires emergency action plans and the use of appropriate equipment 
and proper training before an accident, so workers are not jeopardized," said 
Glendenning, the Fresno-based Cal-OSHA safety expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil companies "are required to test when they're in an area that has the 
potential for hydrogen sulfide," he said. But Glendenning and officials at the 
accident scene Thursday were not ready to discuss their preliminary findings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday morning, survivors hung a white wooden cross to the front gate of 
the Vintage facility at Rincon for one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "For our dear friend Randy Johnson," it read, in black handwritten letters. 
"Your family and friends will truly miss you forever. Love from us all."

 WHAT STRIKE? Baseball strike or no (A1), business is in full swing at some 
Ventura County sports bars, where spectators are finding no shortage of other 
games to watch. The NFL preseason has already started, and bar owners say 
football fans who frequent local watering holes outnumber baseball fans anyway. 
"The only time you get interest in baseball is during the World Series," said 
John Vanderwall, owner of the Tree House Sports Bar & Grill in Simi Valley. As 
for the strike, he said: "It won't hurt my business at all." 
</P>
<P>
 IT'S THE PRINCIPLE: State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) has received the 
1994 Integrity Award from California Common Cause for "adhering to ethical 
principles." Hart shares the award with Republican state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
of Newport Beach. . . . The honor has been bestowed only once before, in 1992, 
when the watchdog group started the awards program. Hart "exemplifies what a 
public servant should be," said Executive Director Ruth Holton.  
</P>
<P>
 ROAD WORK: Ventura County construction crews are moving forward with the final 
phase of a construction project on Santa Rosa Road, based on findings that most 
of the artifacts at a Chumash burial site there were removed years ago (B1). . 
. . Work on a portion of the project was halted last year after bone fragments 
were discovered. "All in all, we're happy with the way things are going," said 
county official W. Butch Britt. "The end result will be a better and safer 
road."

 HARD AT PLAY: A fierce game of Scrabble is not for the faint of heart. Just 
ask Joyce Frasco of Moorpark, who will compete this weekend in the National 
Scrabble Championships at Universal City. . . . Frasco, 64, once ranked at the 
expert level in competition, but is playing fewer games these days and has 
dropped down a notch. Top-ranked Scrabblers play at least 10 games a week and 
spend hours memorizing word lists. Bluffing and cagey strategy also come in 
handy. "It's not a casual game," Frasco said.

CUBAN AMERICANS HOLD BACK ON FLOTILLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warned repeatedly that they would be arrested and their boats seized, Cuban 
Americans here so far have resisted the temptation to launch a high-seas 
flotilla to Cuba to pick up relatives and bring them to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, people have learned the lesson," said Spanish-language radio talk 
show host Tomas Garcia Fuste, referring to the chaotic 1980 Mariel boat lift, 
in which 125,000 Cubans, including large numbers of criminals and mental 
patients, were allowed to flee to South Florida. "They do not want to dance to 
Fidel Castro's music. There will not be another Mariel." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, local officials remain concerned a week after an unprecedented riot on 
the streets of Havana and a clear threat from the Cuban president to open Cuban 
ports to defectors if the United States does not take "serious measures to 
guard their coasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clinton Administration said Wednesday that 12 Coast Guard and 
Navy vessels have been ordered to head for the Straits of Florida, Dade County 
Manager Joaquin Avino admitted Thursday that "we face three days of lag time 
(between a declared emergency and the start of a military blockade), and we 
would be on our own holding them back." 
</P>
<P>
 Avino refused to divulge details of local contingency plans, but heading off a 
boat lift presumably would fall to police and marine patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Avino said there is no evidence that any flotilla is in the 
making. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauding the "intelligence and maturity" of South Florida Cubans, Avino said: 
"The Cuban American community is not going to let Castro say what is going to 
happen here. Conditions are not the same as in 1980 (and not right) for another 
Mariel to occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one factor that has mitigated the desire of many in South Florida to 
sail to Cuba in hopes of taking relatives from there has been what Avino called 
the "silent migration," in which thousands of Cubans who enter the United 
States each year on tourist visas do not return to their native land. 
</P>
<P>
 Dade County officials estimated that as many as 30% of the 1,600 Cubans who 
arrive in Miami on charter flights each week overstay visas and do not go home. 
Other Cubans enter the country on illegal visas obtained in Costa Rica or the 
Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Avino estimated that as recently as two years ago, about 14,000 Cubans a month 
were entering the country as tourists, most of them to stay. Now, with fewer 
tourist visas being issued by American authorities in Cuba, that figure has 
been cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, whether they arrive on a visa or on a raft, as about 400 to 500 
refugees a month do now, no Cuban -- except for hard-core felons -- is ever 
deported. The United States treats all Cubans as individuals seeking political 
asylum; the United States has no deportation agreement with the Cuban 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia Fuste said that many exiles who have been here for more than 10 years 
already have managed to bring their families from Cuba. "Only those who came in 
the last three years or so want to get family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of Mariel also remains strong and bitter here. Although a proposed 
naval blockade is designed primarily to stop a north-south flow of U.S. 
residents to Cuba, Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) said he could foresee a situation 
in which Cubans would be stopped at sea if there were evidence Castro again was 
sending criminals or other dangerous people to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials are also preparing. Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles said that 
refugees arriving in the Florida Keys or Miami would be sent immediately to 
reception areas as far away as Palm Beach County, identified and medically 
screened and bused to a larger staging area such as Homestead Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 From Homestead -- which is all but closed after being extensively damaged by 
Hurricane Andrew in 1992 -- the Cubans would be further dispersed to military 
bases outside Florida, Chiles said in a briefing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, the care and processing of illegal immigrants is a federal 
responsibility, and Avino said Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and other top U.S. 
officials have assured him that responsibility will be met. But state and local 
officials know that South Florida resources will be taxed first by any massive 
influx of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Distant Shore, the classified federal plan to deal with a 
Mariel-type emergency, earmarks $35 million to reimburse state and local 
governments for housing, food and health care. But under normal conditions, the 
cost of caring for illegal immigrants in Florida runs to $884 million a year, 
according to state estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Florida sued the federal government, saying its failed 
immigration policy costs the state as much as $2.5 billion a year in schools, 
hospitals, prisons and other public services. Chiles has said the federal 
government's failure to accept responsibility for the flood of illegal 
immigrants who arrive in Florida each year "has created a nightmare for state 
and local governments . . . (and deprives) our citizens of services we can't 
give them." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the slow-motion immigration continues. The Coast Guard reported 
spotting at least seven rafts in the Straits of Florida on Thursday; the number 
of Cubans who have sailed to this country this year has climbed toward 5,400. 
In 1993 -- a record year -- 3,656 sailed in on small boats and inner-tube 
rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Key West, 25 of the 26 people aboard a boat commandeered from the port of 
Mariel on Monday were released to a resettlement agency in Miami while federal 
authorities continued to question the Cuban coast guardsman who reportedly 
hijacked the vessel. "The diversion of the naval vessel is under review by our 
office," U.S. Atty. Kendall Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban government has demanded the return of Leonel Macias Gonzalez, 19, 
who allegedly shot at fellow guardsmen when he took over the bright-green boat, 
then stopped at a nearby beach to pick up the others who came with him to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias' girlfriend told reporters Wednesday that he said he fired only when 
fired upon and that he hit no one. The Cuban government said someone was shot.

ACCORD NEAR ON N. KOREAN FUEL RODS, U.S. SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and North Korea hope to agree by this weekend on what to do 
with 8,000 corroding nuclear fuel rods, the top U.S. negotiator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a full settlement of their nuclear dispute is still well out of 
reach, chief U.S. negotiator Robert L. Gallucci said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the two sides were discussing a proposal to send a team of 
international nuclear experts to help North Korea stabilize the corroding fuel 
rods. He said the United States wants a third country to reprocess the rods so 
North Korea cannot secretly extract plutonium, which can be used to build 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want this fuel reprocessed in North Korea," State Department 
spokesman David Johnson said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators were locked in talks most of Thursday, trying to iron out final 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no comment on any progress. But several sources said there were good 
prospects for an agreement to stabilize the rods and buy time for wider talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallucci planned to meet his North Korean counterpart, Kang Sok Ju, today to 
wrap up the session. The negotiations will resume at a later date, Gallucci 
said.

RULE THROWS A CURVE, BILL FALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The great irony of President Clinton's defeat on the crime bill Thursday is 
that even his opponents agreed that the bill would have passed if it had 
actually come to a straight up-or-down vote. What happened, however, is that 
supporters of the bill got defeated on a procedural motion known as a rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally a technical vote that precedes consideration of every bill that comes 
to the House floor, the rule sets forth the procedures under which a given 
piece of legislation can be debated, amended and voted upon. Traditionally, its 
passage signifies that the bill that follows it will pass by a similar margin. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, even Republicans who support a bill have tended to vote 
against its rule to protest their exclusion by the Democratic majority from the 
rule-making process. While that happened with the crime bill, opposition to the 
rule also came from lawmakers who wanted to use it as a political cover to kill 
the bill without being accused of voting against it. This group included 
conservative Democrats upset with its gun-control provisions and liberals 
angered by its expanded death penalties.

HIGH MORTALITY REPORTED FOR EASTERN TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trees in the biggest forest in the eastern United States appear to be dying at 
three times the natural rate, probably because of pollution, studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest and most majestic trees in the forest, some of them more than 300 
years old, are being hit the hardest, said Orie L. Loucks, an ecosystem 
scientist at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge problem," he said Thursday. "We are losing unique and 
irreplaceable older forests." 
</P>
<P>
 Loucks is studying what is called the mixed mesophytic forest, which stretches 
from Ohio through West Virginia and Kentucky and into Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 He presented the findings at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of 
America and the American Institute of Biological Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, about 5% to 7% of the forest died each decade, as older trees 
gave way to younger growth. Loucks determined that the death rate is now as 
high as 15% to 20% per decade. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the biggest cause is probably ozone, produced by a reaction between 
auto exhausts and industrial pollutants. He said acid rain and nitrogen in 
rainfall, another consequence of pollution, are also hurting the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Twardus, a forest health specialist with the U.S. Forest Service in 
Morgantown, W.Va., said he has seen accelerated tree mortality rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But he questioned whether enough data exists to blame air pollution.

YOUTH ACCUSED IN FLA. TOURIST SLAYING PLEADS NO CONTEST

<TEXT>
<P>
 The youngest of four teen-agers accused of killing a British tourist at an 
Interstate 10 rest stop near here pleaded no contest Thursday to a lesser 
charge and agreed to testify against the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Green, 14, pleaded no contest as a juvenile to one count of being an 
accessory after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Green's lawyer, Greg Cummings, told Circuit Judge F. E. Steinmeyer that the 
plea agreement was in the best interest of Green, who was 13 at the time of the 
shooting. The attorney said Green would testify against the three others. 
</P>
<P>
 Green's mother stood with her son, who was dressed in a shirt, shorts and 
sneakers, as Steinmeyer approved the agreement and praised Green's behavior 
since his release in November, when the judge ruled there wasn't enough 
evidence against him in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me that you're really on the right track," the judge said. "I feel 
like you've got yourself going in the right direction. I want you to know how 
pleased I am."

 Gary Colley was fatally shot last September during a botched robbery. His 
companion, Margaret Jagger, was wounded.

PETER CUSHING, 81; STARRED IN CLASSIC HORROR MOVIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Cushing, the refined British actor who appeared with Sir Laurence 
Olivier in "Hamlet" but was better known around the world as Dr. Frankenstein 
in classic Gothic horror films, died Thursday of cancer in Canterbury, England. 
He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a dear, sweet, funny man, totally unlike the characters he played. He 
died with his boots on," said Los Angeles producer Ted Newsom, for whom Cushing 
narrated a documentary six weeks ago titled "Flesh and Blood -- Hammer Heritage 
of Horror." 
</P>
<P>
 Cushing found regular work as a young actor in films ranging widely from "The 
Man in the Iron Mask" to Laurel and Hardy's "A Chump at Oxford" to Olivier's 
1948 version of "Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
 But the gaunt Cushing found his true metier in the 1950s with Great Britain's 
Hammer Studios, playing the imposing Baron Frankenstein to Christopher Lee's 
monster. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Cushing's bloodcurdling films as the good doctor were "Frankenstein and 
the Monster From Hell," "Frankenstein Created Woman," "The Revenge of 
Frankenstein," "The Evil of Frankenstein" and "Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved playing Frankenstein," Cushing told The Times in 1982. "We were 
fantasy figures, weren't we?" 
</P>
<P>
 The actor described his singular horror background in two books, "Past 
Forgetting: Memoirs of the Hammer Years" in 1988, and "An Autobiography" in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Cushing teamed up with Lee in other horror movies such as "Dr. Terror's House 
of Horrors" and as Dr. Van Helsing opposite Lee's Count Dracula in "Count 
Dracula and His Vampire Bride." 
</P>
<P>
 The stately Cushing took his place in a long line of actors portraying the 
singular sleuth Sherlock Holmes in the 1959 film "The Hound of the 
Baskervilles." He also took on the role for a British television series. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger viewers may remember the versatile character actor as Grand Moff 
Tarkin in the 1977 blockbuster "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally chafing at being stereotyped in horror roles, Cushing said 
pragmatically: "I don't have any regrets. Things like Frankenstein and Dracula 
were such big successes and they obviously led to a lot of sequels." 
</P>
<P>
 Cushing was born May 26, 1913, in Kenley, England. He worked as a clerk in a 
surveyor's office before winning a scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music 
and Drama in London. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his stage debut in Worthing, England, in 1935 as Capt. Randall in "The 
Middle Watch," and his Broadway debut six years later as Percival in "The 
Seventh Trumpet." He also toured Australia and New Zealand with Olivier and his 
Old Vic Company. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to theater and films, Cushing won praise for his television 
appearances, notably in the starring role as Winston Smith in George Orwell's 
"1984," in the title role of "Dr. Who," as Dr. Manette in "A Tale of Two 
Cities" and as professor Charles Copeland in "Helen Keller: The Miracle 
Continues." 
</P>
<P>
 His work was recognized by Queen Elizabeth in 1989, when she named Cushing an 
officer in the Order of the British Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Cushing married actress Helen Beck in 1943. She died in 1971.

GAS LEAK VICTIMS DESCRIBED AS CLOSE-KNIT TEAM; DEATHS: AFTER ONE WORKER 
COLLAPSED IN WELL, TWO OTHERS JUMPED IN TO HELP BUT WERE OVERCOME, WITNESSES 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Speaking quietly in a voice tinged with grief, Cal Hoskins recalled Thursday 
how his son, Jason, had always wanted to follow his footsteps into the oil 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Hoskins watched helplessly at the oil field outside Ventura 
where he had worked for 17 years as paramedics tried unsuccessfully to save his 
son after a deadly leak of hydrogen sulfide gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone asked me to hold the IV," the father said. "That was all I could do 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hoskins, 22, was one of three oil workers who died from the gas leak, an 
incident that has raised questions about the safety precautions used on the 
field leased by Vintage Petroleum about 10 miles north of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules of the oil fields tell workers to back away when the rotten-egg 
stench of hydrogen sulfide emanates from a well. But in this case, the bond of 
a close-knit team proved stronger than the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jason Hoskins collapsed in the well, two other workers employed by Pride 
Petroleum of Ventura to drill the well jumped in to save him, only to be 
overcome themselves, according to witnesses' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other men who tried to help were hospitalized with breathing problems, 
caused when the deadly gas deprived their bodies of needed oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 To Cal Hoskins, a 25-year veteran of the oil fields, Wednesday's tragedy 
represents a "textbook case" of heroic instinct and camaraderie overtaking 
safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to go and help their buddy because that's just the way it is," 
Hoskins said. "Hydrogen sulfide gas doesn't usually take just one." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the lethal gas also claimed the life of Sean David Harris, an 
ambitious young man described by his roommate as "Mr. Oil." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 26, had worked for the firm since 1986 and "was on his way up the 
ladder" with the company, said Don Gandy, a Pride supervisor who roomed with 
Harris in Oxnard. "He was gung-ho." 
</P>
<P>
 The gas also killed Ronald Johnson, 24, a new father who was planning a 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We planned on living together for the rest of our lives," said Shannon 
O'Toole, Johnson's fiancee. "We planned on having more children." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Toole and Johnson lived in Ventura with their 6-month-old son, Tyler. "His 
son meant the world to him," O'Toole said as she began to cry. "He wanted to 
teach all kinds of things to him. The only think that's keeping me here on this 
earth, and not going with him, is his son." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hoskins was also about to become a father. But he will never see his 
first child, due Sept. 26. "It's all I have left of him," said his wife, 
Tiffany, occasionally crying as she sat in the family's living room. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled the night before the accident, when the family watched a 
television movie about Alaskan oil fields. And she remembered what her husband 
said about hydrogen sulfide. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can smell it like rotten eggs," she recalled him saying. "After awhile 
you don't smell it at all. And then you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hoskins started working at Pride Petroleum a year ago. His father, who 
worked for Vintage, got him the job through an old friend, Toby Thrower.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Thrower who broke the news to Cal Hoskins on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cal Hoskins received a phone call just after noon about the oil field 
accident, he sensed that his son had fallen victim to the deadly gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoskins ran out to his truck and raced up the Ventura Freeway to the oil lease 
where he had worked from 1972 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he could reach the crush of paramedics and firefighters, Thrower, his 
son's supervisor, tried to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't go up there. You don't want to go," Thrower told him. 
</P>
<P>
 His son and two friends, Thrower told him, had been overcome by deadly 
hydrogen sulfide gas in the cellar of an old well. 
</P>
<P>
 Water had begun gushing out of the well, so Jason Hoskins had gone into the 
cellar to shut off a valve, Thrower told him. When he passed out, Johnson went 
down to try to save his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 After Johnson succumbed to the fumes, Thrower, 55, said he ran to call for 
help. Before he returned, however, the third member of the crew, Sean Harris, 
had also jumped into the cellar and passed out. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Cal Hoskins arrived, the three men had suffered cardiac arrest. 
Paramedics were working, in vain, to revive the three young friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a team," Hoskins said sadly. "They'd been working together for a 
year now and they were all tight. They were just kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Thrower himself later grew ill from the fumes and received special oxygen 
treatment at St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived disoriented and despondent, said Tom Millington, the physician who 
heads the hospital's hyperbaric medicine department. 
</P>
<P>
 "You actually had to press him and say 'Breathe,' " Millington said. "We had 
to keep waking him up to keep him with the program." 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving some oxygen from a tank, Thrower began to feel better and 
asked to leave the hospital. He also asked for a cigarette, Millington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Thrower underwent treatment in the hyperbaric chamber, a pressurized 
cylinder that allows doctors to administer doses of pure oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrower was released from the hospital Thursday morning and returned to his 
Oak View home. Feeling better physically, he remained distraught about the 
accident, said his wife, Shirley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard on everybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Sandoval, 34, of Bakersfield, working at the site for Schlumberger Well 
Services, also suffered respiratory problems from inhaling the deadly gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval declined to comment, but Millington said that Sandoval had been 
lowered into the well on a harness, wrapped his arms around one of the victims 
and pulled him out. Aware of the gas leak, Sandoval held his breath, Millington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It saved his life," Millington said. "If he had breathed he would have been 
the fourth victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he suffered respiratory problems severe enough that his breathing 
nearly stopped at Ventura County Medical Center. After treatment in the 
hyperbaric chamber, he was released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other victims, Derek Abbott, 18, of Oak View, and Jerry Walker, 41, of 
Bakersfield, remained at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in fair condition 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 J.B. Wilmeth, the doctor overseeing their treatment, said both had been 
examined for brain damage, a possible side effect of exposure to hydrogen 
sulfide. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond any physical damage, the survivors suffer the inevitable emotional 
trauma from seeing co-workers fall. Cal Hoskins, himself, said he wondered if 
he would be able to return to his life's work in the oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said. "I've got to drive by that well. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's also my life."

OXNARD SCHOOLS TO SPEND $10,000 TO FIGHT VANDALISM; EDUCATION: BOARD VOTES TO 
HIRE ANOTHER GUARD AND INCREASE HEIGHT OF GATES AFTER ATTACK ON NEWEST CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Responding to an incident of vandalism at its newest campus, the Oxnard School 
District will spend about $10,000 to improve the school's entrance gates and 
post temporary, round-the-clock security at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 A security guard has patrolled the $21-million Robert J. Frank Intermediate 
School since it opened last week, including the campus in routine 
Monday-through-Friday tours of all the district's schools, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, the school board unanimously approved hiring an 
additional officer to guard the Frank campus, on North Juanita Avenue near 
Colonia Road, in the evenings and on weekends for the next six weeks, or until 
the gates are made more secure. The school's architect has been asked to help 
draw up a plan to make the gates higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need this type of security until we are sure that no one can get in," said 
Trustee James T. Suter. "We can't hope that nothing will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action comes in the wake of an incident last weekend, in which an 
unknown number of vandals climbed over the school's gates, broke 78 water 
sprinkler heads and smashed 16 floodlights and fixtures, causing $6,000 in 
damage, said school Principal Pete Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised that anyone would want to destroy something that is so vital 
to so many young people," said Trustee Dorothie Sterling. "They don't 
understand that they are destroying something that belongs to them." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police and school officials, the vandals scaled one of three 
nine-foot-high gates to gain entry to the campus.  
</P>
<P>
 The board directed school administrators to spend up to $10,000 to increase 
the height of the three gates and install a deterrent at the top to prevent 
anyone from climbing over them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they get in, no one can see them," Suter said, referring to the school's 
office and classroom entrances, which all face away from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, between La Colonia and the Ventura Freeway, is an easy target 
because of the remoteness of its location, said Oxnard Police Detective Gino 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 The fenced-in campus has celery and strawberry fields on its north and east 
sides, and athletic fields to its south and west. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalism at the Frank School marked the second such incident in the 
district in two recent weeks. On July 24, vandals struck at Fremont 
Intermediate School, scrawling graffiti and obscene drawings on all but one of 
the school's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The district spent nearly $900 to cover the graffiti, said Fremont Principal 
Paul Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Bernard Korenstein said vandalism is on the rise districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always had vandalism in our schools," Korenstein said. "But not to 
this extent." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said the crime has been more common at high schools than in middle 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "School vandalism goes hand-in-hand with gang activity, and as the number of 
gangs increase in the middle schools, vandalism also increases," Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District spends about $100,000 a year on security 
and another $100,000 to repair damage from vandalism, said assistant business 
manager Richard W. Canady. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have vandalism virtually everyday," Canady said. "It's rare when it 
doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Frank School, concerned parents are forming a neighborhood watch group 
to patrol the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we organize ourselves, we will be able to keep an eye on the school," 
said Rosa Garibay, whose daughter is a seventh-grade student at Frank. "It's 
sad what happened to our new neighborhood school. We will do everything we can 
to prevent that."

SANTA ROSA ROAD PROJECT ENTERING THE HOMESTRETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction crews are putting the finishing touches to a section of scenic 
Santa Rosa Road this week while preparing to step up work on the final one-mile 
leg of the road that slices through the Santa Rosa Valley between Thousand Oaks 
and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 With four miles already paved and widened since 1990, construction workers are 
now beginning heavy grading on the last mile of the 90-year-old thoroughfare 
that runs from Camarillo's eastern border to the Norwegian Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-mile section was caught up in controversy earlier this year when 
county crews uncovered what they thought were bone fragments from an ancient 
Chumash burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on that section slowed until an archeologist evaluated the bone 
fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials now say that Santa Monica-based archeologist C.W. Clewlow Jr. 
found that the site once contained Native American artifacts, but that they 
have long since been removed by treasure seekers and archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Clewlow's report will go to the county Board of Supervisors next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Escoto, an aide to county Supervisor Maggie Kildee, said that the board 
ordered the county's Public Works Department to take a "go-slow" approach to 
road construction near the Chumash site until it could be examined for 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a very legitimate concern about what was out there," Escoto said. 
"It was only prudent to slow work and be cautious until we knew for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 But work to widen the congested roadway and make its sharp turns less 
dangerous is now back on track, said W. Butch Britt, deputy director of public 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work on the eastern side is just being finished this week and we will 
shortly begin construction of a detour for traffic on the final leg," Britt 
said. "We're happy with the way things are going. The end result will be a 
better and safer road." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic engineers are adding road signs and readjusting lane striping this 
week after observing the behavior of the estimated 11,000 motorists who use the 
road daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we have widened the road, we began noticing that some people were 
passing others on the right side, which isn't very safe," Britt said. "We are 
dealing with that by re-striping the lanes and making them a little more 
constrictive." 
</P>
<P>
 The county is erecting traffic signs that warn motorists of crossroads and 
interchanges where motorists are likely to make left turns. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete the last mile of construction, workers will first build a parallel 
road that will allow traffic and construction to proceed unabated. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt said the $5.5-million project on the two-lane road has been under way 
since 1990. It remains two lanes, but the lanes are wider, as are the paved 
road shoulders. In addition, dangerous curves and hills that obstructed views 
have been altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to be finished by December, Britt said.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; BILL TARGETS DRIVERS WITH 
INVALID LICENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CROGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Two strikes and your car is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what will happen if the proposed Safe Streets Act of 1994 (AB 
3148), introduced by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), becomes law and 
you're caught driving a second time with a suspended or revoked driver's 
license.  
</P>
<P>
 Considered one of the toughest unlicensed drivers' bills in the country, the 
amended legislation will subject your car to immediate seizure and forfeiture 
unless the vehicle is owned by another person or company, or claimed by a 
spouse as community property. According to the Department of Motor Vehicles, 
between 1.7 million and 2 million drivers have lost their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's supporters claim an estimated 75% of convicted drunk drivers will 
continue to drive without a license and be involved in the majority of fatal 
hit and runs. AB 3148 cleared one of its final major hurdles Monday, when it 
was voted out of the state Senate's Judiciary Committee by a 7-4 vote. Now it's 
headed to the Senate Appropriations Committee, where it's expected to be 
shepherded through by the committee chairman, state Sen. Robert Presley 
(D-Riverside), an ardent supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is AB 3148 a punishment that fits the crime or just another "Big Brother" 
power grab by the state? 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) 
</P>
<P>
 "The genesis of this bill came from me being sick and tired of seeing stories 
about another innocent victim killed by a convicted drunk driver who turns out 
to be driving with a suspended or revoked license. I felt incredibly frustrated 
that higher fines, revoking licenses and jail time had absolutely no effect.  
</P>
<P>
 "The capper for me was watching a television news crew follow a convicted 
drunk driver from court, after he just had his license revoked and film him 
driving off in his car. That's when I decided we needed something much more 
severe and simple to enforce. You get caught driving without a license and you 
lose your car. You can't drive what you don't have. Statistics from law 
enforcement and howdeep the DMV show that convicted drunk drivers are four 
times as likely to become involved in a fatal hit-and-run accident. So this 
bill will save lives by getting these people off our roads." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Charles Calderon (D-Whittier), a Judiciary Committee member who was 
undecided, but finally voted yes on AB 3148 after it was amended 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand Richard's wanting to get convicted drunk drivers and other 
people who violate our laws off the streets and I support him on that. But I 
feel this bill, as it's currently written, paints too broad a stroke. It should 
be more focused on the drunk driver. I also believe that . . . driving is not a 
privilege, it's a right. That's especially true in poor areas, where public 
transportation is bad and you have to drive to work and to shop.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm especially concerned about community property and the uncontrollable 
drinker, who takes the car despite his family's efforts to stop him. Do we 
penalize the whole family by taking their car? I can't support that."  
</P>
<P>
 (A community property exemption regarding immediate forfeiture was included in 
this latest version of the bill.) 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Lobaco, legislative director, ACLU California Legislative Office in 
San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
 "If you liked the state's drug asset forfeiture law that just expired, a law 
which Richard (Katz) wrote, then you'll love this Safe Streets Act. Talk about 
Big Brother in action. I can appreciate his attempt to keep convicted drunk 
drivers off the road. I can support that. But focus in on them. This bill is a 
violation of due process, and will impact most heavily on poor people.  
</P>
<P>
 "What happens to people who lose their license after an accident, because they 
can't afford insurance and still pay rent or buy food? Do we let them die or 
put them on welfare, if they lose their car?"

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; AUSTIN-HEALEY STILL KING OF THE ROAD TO 
SOME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 James Bond may have preferred an Aston Martin, but Austin-Healey, another 
popular British sports car, has its own loyal following here on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 of the classic sports cars are on display this week in a free car 
show at the Colony Harbortown Marina Resort in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Garofalo, chairman of the 18th annual West Coast Meet, said the show has 
drawn dozens of owners from Washington to San Diego, who have come to socialize 
and display their unique, two-seater, convertible sports cars. Since the show 
opened on Tuesday, more than 500 spectators have attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are true sports cars, true roadsters," Garofalo said, adding that the 
cars were constructed in England in the 1950s and early 1960s. He said the 
small to mid-size cars have "very powerful engines" and have won numerous 
awards in England and other countries for racing. 
</P>
<P>
 But in today's meets, Garofalo said, the now "truly classic cars" are no 
longer raced, but are judged and honored for restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The exterior and interior of the cars, including the engine, he said, are 
judged by owners who have placed in previous contests, looking for cars that 
are restored to a brand-new condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole object is to restore the car to the original specifications as it 
was when it left the factory," Garofalo said. "It has to look like it just came 
off the showroom floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Garofalo said seven cars entered the competition this year, and were judged 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully refurbishing an Austin-Healey, he said, costs thousands of dollars and 
can run as much as $18,000 after parts are purchased. Buying an Austin-Healey 
can cost up to $35,000, he said, adding he has seen one sell for almost $70,000 
at an auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Garofalo said competition winners will be announced at a dinner dance Saturday 
evening. The car show ends Sunday morning. JASON GRANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CABLE REFUND BID INADEQUATE, CITY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council has rejected a cable company's plan to refund money to 
customers, saying that the offer fails to fully reimburse subscribers the 
amount they are owed. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to new Federal Communications Commission regulations to lower 
cable rates, the city last month ordered Ventura County Cablevision and its 
parent company, Western Communications, to refund about $6,000 to about 3,360 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable company offered to refund about $4,900, or $1,100 less than the city 
had requested. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and the cable company disagree on how the refund should be calculated 
under the new FCC guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable officials say that over the years, they have undercharged customers for 
equipment and some services. They argue that under the new regulations, they 
are allowed to subtract the undercharged amount from the refund owed to 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials argue that such undercharges cannot be recouped. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Cablevision President David LaRue said the additional $1,100 
that the city wants his company to repay is a relatively small amount, but 
"it's important for us to uphold the principle regardless of the amount of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 If the company pays the money in Ojai, he said, other cities will seek similar 
concessions. Laurie DeVarney, the city's cable consultant, urged Ojai City 
Council members to reject the cable company's refund plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the legal battlefield now, if you wish to play that game," she told the 
three council members present for the unanimous vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRue said the matter will ultimately be resolved by the FCC. JASON GRANT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Ventura's community services department is hosting an 
inter-generational sportfishing tournament Saturday at the newly remodeled 
Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths and adults are invited to attend the free event; and fishing parties 
must be accompanied by someone 50 years of age or older.Organizers hope the 
contest will promote understanding and interaction among different age groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first fishing tournament since the pier's been remodeled," 
spokeswoman Andrea Windle said. "The neat thing about it is that it is an 
inter-generational event, and that is also a first. It gives people a chance to 
close the generation gap." 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament begins at 6 a.m. and fish will be judged from noon to 1 p.m. 
Registration will take place between 6 a.m. and noon. Anglers must bring their 
own gear, but bait will be available if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will be divided into nine age divisions and can enter various 
categories, including grandparent-child, mother-child, brother-sister, and pals 
under and over 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Prizes, which will be based on fish weight, will include fishing trips, 
tackle, reels, poles and gift certificates to restaurants and fishing supply 
shops. Raffle prizes will be awarded as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A fly-fishing specialist will be on hand to give demonstrations and 
instruction on casting and fly-tying. For more information call 658-4732. TRACY

<P>
 The Navy will offer public tours of the guided missile cruiser Port Royal at 
the Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme next week, officials 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tours are scheduled for Aug. 20 and 21.Public visiting hours for the 
567-foot-long warship will be 10 a.m. to 3:15 p.m., said Teri Reid, a Navy 
spokeswoman.

making a port call to the Port Hueneme-based laboratories of the Naval Surface 
Warfare Center to have its missile and gun systems checked and evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port Royal is the last of the Navy's Ticonderoga-class of guided missile 
cruisers and is equipped with the computer-controlled Aegis weapons system. The 
vessel has 28 officers and 342 enlisted personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid said visitors wishing to tour the Port Royal should enter the base at the 
Pleasant Valley Road gate and park in marked areas. Buses will be provided to 
and from the ship.

 The base gate will close at 3:15 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The last tour will 
conclude at 4 p.m. J.E. MITCHELL

<P>
 Two adults and three juveniles were arrested after shots were fired in a fight 
between two rival street gangs in Ventura's Montalvo area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five were arrested after they jumped into a nearby car and fired several 
rounds from a handgun during the street fight late Wednesday, said Ventura 
Police Cpl.Thomas Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said officers were able to quickly pull the car over and arrest the 
five people inside without incident. The handgun believed used in the shooting 
was recovered nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured during the incident, which took place near the intersection 
of Peacock Avenue and Whippoorwill Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said Sandro Mendez, 18, of Ventura was arrested on suspicion of weapons 
violations and booked into Ventura County Jail. He was released on his 
recognizance Thursday. Rudolfo Martinez, 21, also of Ventura, was cited and 
released at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Three juvenile males, whose names were not released because of their ages, 
were detained by police but were later released into the custody of their 
parents. J. E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COLLEGE DISTRICT SELLS 21 HORSES AT 
AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-one horses from the now defunct Moorpark College Equestrian Program 
have been sold to 10 Ventura County buyers, who purchased the animals in a 
public sale this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other horses that received no bids during an auction Wednesday night will 
be sold privately, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, the auctioned horses sold for $485, with the highest bid claiming 
an 18-year-old gelding for $1,500 and the lowest buying a 2-year-old gelding 
for $50, Community College District comptroller Sue Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is requiring that buyers sign a pre-possession agreement stating 
that they will not sell the horses to anyone for use as food products. The 
agreement also states that owners must have adequate facilities to keep the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson acknowledged that the district does not intend to inspect those 
facilities before turning the horses over to the new owners, and does not have 
any safeguards planned to assure that the animals are not sold for slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've asked them not to do that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the horses were purchased by local citizens, the Foxfield Riding 
School in Westlake bought eight of them, including a 20-year-old gelding with 
chronic back problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to give them good homes," said Olga Ascione, the stable 
manager at Foxfield. "If they can't do that much, they will just live happy in 
pasture." 
</P>
<P>
 The new owners have until Aug. 19 to pick up the horses, which have been 
staying at an Ojai ranch since the equestrian program closed amid turmoil in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community College District ordered an appraisal and public sale of the 
animals after learning that the program's former instructor had sold several 
horses privately and for low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Ventura County district attorney's office and the college 
district launched investigations into the disappearance of more than 20 horses 
that were used in the program. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; MAN IS CONVICTED OF ANIMAL CRUELTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County jury convicted a Moorpark man on Thursday of four criminal 
counts for nearly starving to death his two horses in their Newbury Park 
pasture. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury in Superior Court found Michael Stephen Ney, 49, guilty of two felony 
counts of animal cruelty and two misdemeanor counts of not providing the horses 
with food or water. 
</P>
<P>
 Ney could receive 44 months in prison and a $40,000 fine for the felony 
convictions and another year in jail for the misdemeanors. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Richard E. Simon said his office has not decided if it will seek a prison or 
jail term. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Humane Society found the two geldings at the pasture, 333 
Newbury Lane, on Oct. 18. The horses -- a thoroughbred and a Hanoverian -- were 
each about 350 pounds underweight, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 During the four-day trial, Simon showed the videotapes and pictures of the 
horses before they were confiscated and images of them after they were cared 
for by the Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
 On the stand, Ney testified that he properly cared for the horses and that 
their drop in weight was due to medical problems. Simon disputed that 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the evidence showed is their condition was due to neglect, and not 
medical problems," he said after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Since being seized, the thoroughbred has gained about 400 pounds while the 
Hanoverian has put on about 310 pounds, according to court testimony. DWAYNE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; NEW WATCH PROGRAM TO HELP FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of the Las Casitas community in Thousand Oaks will take another step 
to combat crime this weekend by launching a new Neighborhood Watch program. 
</P>
<P>
 The property managers will throw a kick-off party Saturday for the new program 
in hopes of signing up residents to patrol their streets for crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some problems with crime in the past, so this is an attempt to 
emphasize involvement in crime prevention," said Dawn Kuehn, a property 
manager. "We want to have neighbors looking out for neighbors so we can nip 
things in the bud." 
</P>
<P>
 In their effort to reduce crime in the area, Las Casitas homeowners groups 
have already installed new lighting, tightened restrictions on overnight 
parking, and erected a fence around a flood control channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials have credited the steps for some reduction of crime in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the area has not managed to eradicate crime entirely. Most recently, a 
16-year-old girl was shot and killed by a friend in a Las Casitas condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuehn said she is optimistic that the Neighborhood Watch will help further 
reduce crime there. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's event -- which will include food, entertainment and door prizes -- 
will be highlighted by presentations from Ventura County sheriff's crime 
prevention experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will run from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. near the corner of Hillcrest Drive 
and Avenida De La Plata. MATTHEW MOSK

COMPROMISES PLAY CRUCIAL ROLE IN FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS; MOORPARK: CITY GRANTS 
552-HOUSE SUBDIVISION EXEMPTION FROM SUBSEQUENT GROWTH CONTROLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To end a costly lawsuit, the Moorpark City Council has decided to exempt a 
Santa Monica developer's 552-house subdivision from any future city 
growth-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 Wednesday evening to exempt Carlsberg Financial 
Corp.'s southeast area project from a new ordinance that would make it more 
difficult for developers to save housing allocations for use in boom times. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Carlsberg project will be exempt from future controls, the 
company will have to abide by a current slow-growth law -- known as Measure F 
-- even after it expires in December, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the settlement said, however, that forcing Carlsberg to abide by 
Measure F places virtually no control over how quickly it builds homes, since 
permits to build 1,300 houses are currently available. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence Carlsberg will be the only developer that has access to those 
permits," said Councilman Patrick Hunter, the council member who voted against 
the settlement. "Is that truly fair?" 
</P>
<P>
 Measure F was written in 1986 in response to a dramatic surge of growth in 
Moorpark, Hunter said. In the rush to draft controls, certain factors were 
overlooked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-member committee of council members, planning commissioners and 
residents has spent the last year drawing up a new law to replace Measure F 
and, according to Hunter, close loopholes and improve controls.  
</P>
<P>
 If Carlsberg had to abide by the new ordinance, it would not be able to build 
more than 125 homes in a single year, Hunter said.  
</P>
<P>
 The new law would also significantly limit the number of allocations for 
building permits that a developer could carry over into future years. After two 
years, unused allocations would be wiped out and a developer would again have 
to compete for them, Hunter said. No such limits now exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure F Committee members say the new ordinance would make growth steadier 
from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carlsberg and other developers have said that the economy should dictate 
the amount of building. They have argued that they need to hold onto housing 
allocations in slow years so that they can build when people are buying homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsberg tried for six years to build its project before suing the city in 
1991 over the number of homes allowed. Settlement negotiations have taken place 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Scott Montgomery, who voted for the settlement, said it would not 
only end the legal confrontation but benefit the city in other ways. Under the 
settlement, the developer will have to improve two major roadways and build a 
much-needed business park, Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the perfect compromise," he said. "We achieve the goals of our original 
growth-control ordinance, while allowing the developer to complete his 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsberg President Ron Tankersley has said that his company would not have 
agreed to a settlement had the city not exempted the company from future 
changes in law. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hunter said the council caved in to Carlsberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a compromise, it's a concession," he said. "I feel my vote 
against the settlement reflects the view of a majority of residents in the city 
who want effective growth control. I'm concerned now about what sort of 
precedent this exemption sets." 
</P>
<P>
 The council and Carlsberg have agreed to sign settlement documents at a City 
Council meeting scheduled for Sept. 7. At that same meeting they are expected 
to approve Carlsberg's development plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsberg officials said the company would take another year before 
construction begins on the project. They said they do not know how many years 
it will take to build all 552 houses.

COMPROMISES PLAY CRUCIAL ROLE IN FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS; SIMI VALLEY: COMPANY SAYS 
IT WILL DROP LOW-INCOME HOUSING RATHER THAN DELAY PROJECT FOR MORE STUDY. 
</P>

 A Simi Valley developer may scuttle plans to build 31 houses for low-income 
residents -- part of a project initially designed to replace dwellings damaged 
in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin Industries said it will drop 31 low-income homes from a 122-house 
project rather than conduct an environmental study needed to qualify for a 
federal loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council in May agreed to loan Griffin $750,000 in federal 
emergency earthquake funds to build the low-income dwellings as part of a 
larger development at Los Angeles Avenue and Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development said it would not 
release the loan funds for the development unless Griffin provides an 
environmental assessment of the project, a process that could delay 
construction at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental assessments are a standard requirement for most HUD-funded 
development projects, said Aurora Madrigal, a program manager for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to comply with state regulations, Griffin has already conducted an 
Environmental Impact Report on the project, known as Simi Village. But Madrigal 
said that report would not meet HUD requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin Vice President Richard Niec told the city's Affordable Housing 
Subcommittee that his company cannot afford to postpone construction to do an 
additional study. The company wants to break ground next summer and must have 
the HUD approval soon to meet that timetable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time is becoming very short," Niec said. "Should the city not be able to 
assist with the loan, we will proceed with the project without the affordable 
units. That would not be our choice, but without help from the city that is the 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lin Koester said he will try to persuade HUD to drop the 
requirement before the council's Sept. 19 meeting, when Griffin is expected to 
announce its final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Mikels denounced the HUD requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is supposed to be emergency funding to replace lost shelter, this 
request is dumber than the ground," Mikels said. "It seems to me to be 
absolutely ludicrous that the federal government is asking for an environmental 
assessment on top of the impact report." 
</P>
<P>
 But Madrigal said that despite the fact that the funds bear the name 
"emergency," too much time has passed since the quake for HUD to waive the 
study requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about an emergency-type activity that happened on Jan. 17," 
Madrigal said. "If (the developer and the city) had moved with the project at 
that time, we wouldn't have had a problem with it. But six months have gone by 
and (they) can no longer avoid doing the environmental assessment." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake displaced as many as 4,000 Simi Valley residents, causing an 
estimated $150 million in damage to nearly 500 houses and 600 mobile homes, the 
city has reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Griffin had asked the city for a $1-million interest-free loan to 
build 70 condominiums it planned to sell for $90,000 apiece. The units, planned 
for low-income residents, were intended as part of a 280-home development. 
</P>
<P>
 But after studying market conditions and discussing its proposal with the 
city, Griffin scaled back the project. Plans now call for a 122-home 
development, including 31 detached single-family units to be sold at $30,000 
below the market rate to low-income buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council had agreed to make the loan to Griffin out of a $5.5-million 
federal Community Development Block Grant it received for earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The council set aside an additional $600,000 for other development projects. 
But on Wednesday, the Affordable Housing Subcommittee rejected two projects 
vying for those funds, saying they would not be built in time to address the 
needs of residents who lost their homes in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should really concentrate on using these funds for projects that 
are ready to go now," Mikels said. "That's why it's so frustrating that the 
Griffin project is getting stalled."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: BERNSON AGAIN LOOKING LIKE A CANDIDATE SEEKING REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 BERNSON REDUX: Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, after his cliffhanger 
1991 reelection, privately grumbled to just about everybody that he wouldn't 
run again in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Not. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs are unmistakable. The 63-year-old Bernson has put political 
consultant Harvey Englander on the payroll -- Englander handled strategy for 
Bernson's 1991 campaign -- and held a fund-raiser last month at the Greek 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizing the event was Robyn Bernson, the councilman's wife. "She did it for 
free," snorted Bernson chief deputy Greig Smith when asked if Robyn Bernson was 
paid. Well, the question was not totally out of line. The Northridge councilman 
has been repeatedly criticized by ethics watchdogs for using campaign finances 
on meals, travel and other luxuries, although he has never been formally 
accused by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, forget about state Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) trying to 
oust Bernson in the 1995 spring Los Angeles City Council elections. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't happen, says Englander, who ought to know. He not only represents 
Bernson, but also Katz, who is seeking reelection in November. "I've talked to 
Richard about his future," Englander said this week. "And I predict that I 
won't have any conflicts in the near-term future involving these clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about a possible Bernson-Katz matchup arose because Katz will be 
needing a job when term limits end his tenure in the Assembly in 1996. And 
Bernson, troubled by continuing criticism of his campaign spending habits, has 
looked especially vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of a challenge by Katz gained momentum after two mailers from his state 
office were mysteriously sent to hundreds of Bernson constituents living 
outside Katz's assembly district earlier this year. A sheepish state bureaucrat 
later confessed to the snafu. 
</P>
<P>
 All this had given the Bernson camp late-night fits. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the councilman says he feels increasingly confident that Katz won't 
challenge him. A relieved Bernson, for example, returned from a Katz community 
breakfast last month to tell his staff that Katz introduced him as if "he was 
the savior of the world," Bernson deputy Smith said. "It sounded like an 
endorsement." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 ELEMENTARY EDUKASHON: Was it just a test? Or was Dan Quayle doing the 
typesetting? 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows how it happened but Maureen DiMarco, who is running for state 
superintendent of public instruction, received a nomination certificate last 
week with "instruction" misspelled. 
</P>
<P>
 The gold-sealed certificate, issued by the secretary of state's office, said: 
"Maureen G. DiMarco, was nominated to the office of Superintendent of Public 
Insturction. " 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Miller, the acting secretary of state, says he has no idea how it 
happened and that wording on a similar certificate issued to DiMarco's 
opponent, Delaine Eastin, was spelled correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those mysteries of life," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, who is Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary of education and child 
development, said there is nothing puzzling about the misspelling. "Clearly, we 
are in greater need of basic skills out there than anyone actually thought," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says his office already has issued DiMarco a new certificate -- with 
the proper spelling. 
</P>

 CHICK IN THICK: It's been a rough week for Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura 
Chick. Several colleagues clobbered her proposal to limit police response to 
commercial and residential burglar alarms, finally prompting Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky during a recent council session to ask why everyone was "dumping" 
on Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chick problem, according to critics, is that the junior councilwoman has 
proved too bumptious and uncollegial. Supporters say the real problem is that 
Chick is too independent for some City Hall egos. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick has in fact found herself butting heads with two of her San Fernando 
Valley colleagues, Richard Alarcon and Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairwoman of the council's Environmental Quality Committee, Chick is a key 
player in Alarcon's bid to close the city's Lopez Canyon dump -- one of the 7th 
District's least pleasant landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sympathetic to the heavy community pressures facing Alarcon, Chick 
has questioned whether the city can afford to replace the Lopez dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill politics have also reportedly soured Chick's relations with Bernson, 
a noisy opponent of the Browning-Ferris Industries-owned Sunshine Canyon 
landfill, located north of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, the city has spent $750,000 jousting with BFI in 
court over the landfill. Some privately have called it vanity litigation, 
saying it is a wasted effort by Bernson to appease his constituents. Certainly, 
the city has yet to score any lasting victory on the merits of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick has urged a settlement, a suggestion that has made Bernson unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-term councilwoman also has rubbed Councilman Marvin Braude the wrong 
way. Chick has challenged and occasionally upstaged Braude on police issues; 
they both serve on the Public Safety Committee. The latest example has been her 
burglar alarm plan, offered as a compromise to a Braude plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Braude's plan, the LAPD would respond only to alarms that alarm 
companies verify are bona fide break-ins. But Chick believes Braude's plan is a 
political lemon. Her alternative permits police to answer alarms when 
verification is not available after one phone call to the location. Although 
Braude was cranky about Chick's play on the alarm issue, by week's end the pair 
had met to smooth out their differences.

 DEBATE POINTS: U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) has jokingly 
predicted that there'll be so many debates between him and his GOP challenger, 
Richard Sybert, that voters will be "sick" of the pair before election day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sybert -- attorney, policy wonk and former senior aide to Gov. Wilson -- 
says he doubts this alleged debating disease is catching. Sybert says Beilenson 
talks a great deal about debates but has proved elusive when it comes to 
actually arranging them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Sybert, in a letter, urged Beilenson to participate in 10 debates, 
each on a separate topic. He also couldn't help taking a swipe at the "town 
hall meetings" Beilenson has been holding with constituents in his 24th 
Congressional District. "These are nothing more than thinly disguised campaign 
events on the public's nickel," Sybert wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the querulous tone of Sybert's missive, Beilenson wrote back with 
a pledge to debate his challenger, but probably not until the last three weeks 
of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Before then, Beilenson told Sybert, the congressman would be busy attending to 
the public's business. "Every year Congress' busiest time is the last two 
months of the session, and that will be especially true this year," Beilenson 
wrote. "Obviously, the only way I can properly represent my constituents . . . 
is to be in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, Sybert fired back. If Beilenson has time to fly back to Los Angeles 
several times a month to hold regular town hall meetings with his constituents, 
he has time for debates, the challenger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Beilenson has a good debate record. In 1992, he engaged in half a 
dozen debates with his previous GOP challenger, Tom McClintock. In an 
interview, Beilenson said his own experience convinces him that doing debates 
now won't do much good. Voters aren't ready for such dialogue until a few weeks 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, there has been little argument over debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Republican James Rogan, a former Municipal Court judge, and his 
Democratic challenger, former federal prosecutor Adam Schiff, have agreed to 
hold them weekly, starting in late September. 
</P>
<P>
 They decided this in a cordial face-to-face meeting at a Burbank coffee shop 
last week.  
</P>
<P>
 With both contestants well versed in the rough and tumble world of 
argumentation, these debates could prove fun and enlightening, Schiff 
predicted.  
</P>
<P>
 No exact dates or places have been set but "we agreed we wanted the formats to 
be as free-form as possible," Schiff said. "We want to get away from the usual 
stilted debate format." 
</P>
<P>
 No argument there.

VICTIM TOLD OF THREATS BY ACCUSED BOYFRIEND; VIOLENCE: JACQUELINE REAY, 16, WAS 
PRESSURED FOR SEX, PROBATION OFFICER TESTIFIES. THE TROUBLED 17-YEAR-OLD 
DEFENDANT FACES CHARGES IN HER SLAYING.

 Two weeks before being fatally shot by her boyfriend, a 16-year-old Thousand 
Oaks girl told a church counselor the boy was pressuring her for sex and 
threatened her life if she resisted, a Ventura County probation officer 
testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid he would kill me," Jacqueline Reay told the counselor, Officer 
George Contento testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation came during a hearing in which Superior Court Judge Steven Z. 
Perren refused to release the 17-year-old defendant to his mother's custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Perren agreed that Reay's death apparently was accidental, but nonetheless 
ordered the boy kept at Juvenile Hall until his Sept. 12 trial. The judge said 
the defendant "acted utterly irresponsible in brandishing a gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Reay died July 12 after being shot once in the eye by the boy, who was playing 
with the loaded handgun, authorities said. He is charged with one count of 
murder and two counts of brandishing a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's statement to the counselor was one of several revelations made by 
Contento on Thursday. He also said that the 6-foot-4, 240-pound defendant had 
been involved in four fights in the last year with smaller classmates at 
Phoenix School, a Camarillo special-education school run by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's attorney and his friends previously had portrayed the defendant as 
being nonviolent. And authorities cited his lack of criminal history in 
explaining why they are not seeking to try him as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's parents are divorced, and his father has had custody of him for the 
past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Contento, the boy has had behavioral problems since the age of 5. 
In response, his father has sought psychiatric help for the boy and placed him 
in a home for troubled teen-agers from 1983 to 1985, Contento said. The boy 
also had been placed in a psychiatric counseling facility for a short period 
since then, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended the special-education Phoenix School because of his emotional and 
behavioral difficulties, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 He became enraged on Jan. 5 after being advised of a one-day suspension for 
fighting. He knocked a computer monitor and television set onto the floor, 
Contento said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contento said the boy has beaten several other students at the school. In one 
altercation, he left his opponent with "two knots on the head, pain in the face 
and broken glasses," Contento said. A school official who intervened in that 
fight called it the "worst I have seen someone beaten," Contento testified. 
</P>
<P>
 In another fight, the defendant's challenger was 5-foot-5. He grabbed the 
smaller boy "by the throat and shook him with both hands," Contento testified. 
And in yet another confrontation, he lifted a "younger and smaller peer" and 
"threw him into the wall with great force," Contento told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 As for her confession to Lona Chesley, the counselor at Conejo Valley Church 
of the Nazarene, Reay said "her boyfriend" was "forcing her to submit to 
whatever he wanted," Contento testified. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if they had had sex, the girl became silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looked down at the floor and didn't answer," said Chesley's report, read 
in court by Contento. "Jackie said, 'I'm afraid he would kill me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the boy's mother told the judge that her son is nonviolent. She described 
her son and Reay as a loving couple who were frequently "holding hands, always 
together . . . walking in the water, putting on tanning lotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the school fights were not his fault, she said. Other children started 
them and her son defended himself, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She told Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn that she has never seen her son 
become violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not witnessed anything," she said.

DUMP TO PAY NUNS $500,000 TO MOVE; OXNARD: SISTER SERVANTS OF MARY HAD 
COMPLAINED THAT NEIGHBORING BAILARD LANDFILL WAS HAZARDOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Operators of the Bailard Landfill have agreed to pay a group of nuns who live 
near the Oxnard-area dump $500,000 to relocate, according to a settlement 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sister Servants of Mary, who have run their convent for 30 years, 
complained that the noise, dust and odor from the landfill was unhealthy and at 
times unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 So they fought efforts by the operators this year to extend the life of the 
dump to 1997 and even threatened a lawsuit when local officials approved the 
extension in March. 
</P>
<P>
 But after months of negotiation, the nuns have reached an agreement with the 
Ventura Regional Sanitation District, said the nuns' lawyer, Stanley E. Cohen. 
In addition to receiving the $500,000, the nuns can keep their property and 
move back after the landfill is closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was the best deal possible," Cohen said. "There was an initial 
offer of $20,000. Now they're getting $500,000." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The dump was scheduled to close last December. But the County Board of 
Supervisors voted in March keep it open until May, 1997. Shortly thereafter, 
the sisters demanded money to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuns originally asked the district to buy their property and find a 
different place for them to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the district filed a lawsuit in June to force the nuns to accept 
$96,500 as compensation for their inconvenience. That lawsuit was dismissed, 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, failure to close the dump by May, 1997, will result in 
the payment of $10,000 per month to the nuns for the first six months. After 
that, the monthly payment would increase to $15,000, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother Superior Josephine Torres of the convent said Thursday that she had not 
been informed of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The convent is one of six facilities in the United States that trains nuns for 
the Sister Servants of Mary order. Nuns in the order take care of the homebound 
sick and elderly.

ETHICS QUESTIONS ON PARADE; ASTONISHING ESPY CASE SHOWS THE WORK LEFT FOR THIS 
ADMINISTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-six years after Sherman Adams was forced out as President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower's chief of staff for accepting a vicuna coat from a corrupt 
financier, we witness the spectacle of Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's secretary of agriculture of course should have known 
better than to accept favors from Tyson Foods and Quaker Oats; now Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno has had to ask for an independent counsel to investigate her fellow 
Cabinet member for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 This just days after a new counsel took over the Whitewater inquiry, which 
involves Clinton himself. And on Thursday the White House issued a ban on 
Administration officials accepting travel and lodging from private companies 
and associations, as if the need to shun such gifts were not already obvious. 
It is to be hoped that the appointment of Abner Mikva, an eminent federal 
judge, as the new White House counsel will bring ethical ballast to the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The gifts in the Espy matter were trivial: meals, transportation, lodging and 
sports tickets from Tyson Foods, a major Arkansas poultry producer regulated by 
Espy's department, and a Chicago Bulls game ticket from Quaker Oats. The larger 
question is whether Espy -- who denies any wrongdoing -- granted these 
companies special favors. The independent counsel will delve into that, and we 
should await a fair investigation before drawing conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy says he has reimbursed the two companies but has refused to repay Tyson 
for the expenses of his companion, Patricia Dempsey, because she is not a 
government official. Does he not realize that Tyson paid her way because she 
was his friend? The Agriculture Department would not tolerate such ethical 
standards in a meat inspector. Should it tolerate them in its leader?

OIL BUSINESS HISTORICALLY A DANGEROUS BUT LUCRATIVE VENTURE FOR COUNTY; SAFETY: 
SINCE 1890, DRILLING HAS PROVIDED MONEY AND SECURITY. NOW NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN 
REDUCE HAZARDS, BUT JOBS MAY BE DRYING UP.

<P>
 Oil has always been a dangerous enterprise in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 But the money has always been good, and until recently the jobs were available 
from one generation to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has lived with the danger since 1890, when prospectors tapped 
California's first gusher near Santa Paula.

 "In the good old days, you'd see one of those old drillers, and he'd be 
missing a couple of fingers," said Ed Huhn of the Bakersfield-based Oil 
Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, which represents Ventura County workers. 
"That was really common back then." 
</P>
<P>
 Oil workers say the job is not as hazardous as it used to be, due to advances 
in safety technology. But the risk remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecil Horton, who ran a Pride Petroleum oil rig in Ventura for five years, 
said the oil business is still full of peril. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pulling a pipe out once and the whole rig turned over," said Horton, 
who now manages Cavin's Oil Well Tools in Ventura. "Luckily, I only broke my 
jaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said he was a friend of Ronald Johnson and Sean Harris, two of the 
three men killed during Wednesday's hydrogen sulfide gas leak, and had actually 
run the machine they were using when they succumbed to the gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dangerous work, and you have to be aware of everything," Horton said. 
"(Hydrogen sulfide) is one of the scariest things, because it can kill you 
before you know it's there." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking out a pocket-sized sensor, Horton said he was surprised that workers 
were apparently not using such a device to monitor the site of the accident. 
The sensor, which he said costs about $20, contains litmus paper that darkens 
if it comes in contact with hydrogen sulfide, warning workers that respiratory 
equipment might be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could have saved their lives," Horton said. "I can't believe they 
weren't using anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of hydrogen sulfide gas is well-known among oil workers, but is not 
the concern it once was, due to improved safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much safer now than it was then because of the technology," Huhn said. 
"Most sites have sensors and alarm devices, and most of our workers have 
breathing equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick French, a rig supervisor with California Production Service of Ventura, 
said that when he started in the business as a laborer 15 years ago, workers 
had to adapt to the perils of their job quickly or suffer injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Safety is the No. 1 concern now," French said. "Doing things as cheaply and 
quickly as possible isn't more important any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the companies in the county are staffed by local residents, many of 
whose fathers and grandfathers worked the same oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a more fast-paced, family-based business when I started," French said. 
"That has changed."  
</P>
<P>
 Laborers today make $12 to $15 an hour and work eight to 10 hours a day, 
French said. The money, and promise of upward mobility which many area workers 
have realized over the years, still attracts hard-working youths to the oil 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But jobs today are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial security and comfort that attracted many to the oil business 
have disappeared. From the Rincon to Piru, the county's petroleum resources are 
drying up. Layoffs are common. Longstanding companies have moved from Ventura 
to Bakersfield or other, more lucrative spots. And some oil officials are 
saying that there is no future for oil workers in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a union chapter in Ventura anymore," Huhn said. "There weren't 
enough people." 
</P>
<P>
 The oil industry has never been perfect, oil workers say. But it is still 
better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a good way to make a living," French said. "In some ways, it's 
better than it's ever been."

OBITUARIES ; ALBERT W. LACHASSE; REAL ESTATE AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Albert W. LaChasse, a retired Glendale real estate agent whose experiences as 
a prisoner of war during World War II won him both the Purple Heart and a role 
in the film "Stalag 17," has died. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Glendale resident, LaChasse died Saturday of a heart attack while 
vacationing in Hawaii, said his son, Dean LaChasse of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on Oct. 9, 1942, that 2nd Lt. LaChasse was forced to parachute from his 
B-17 bomber -- the Snoozy II -- when it was attacked over France on its maiden 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we had to get out," he once said of the doomed flight. "The whole 
world was shooting at us, the ship was on fire and there was death on board. I 
jumped." 
</P>
<P>
 Captured a month later by German soldiers in occupied France, LaChasse was 
eventually sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagen, Germany, where he remained captive 
until April 29, 1945, when the prison camp was liberated by Gen. George Patton 
and his troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Sought out as technical adviser for the 1953 film "Stalag 17," LaChasse was 
given a small role alongside Oscar-winner William Holden as a fellow prisoner 
of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the war, he sold cars for a short time and eventually became a real 
estate agent with his own company, LaChasse Realty. He retired in the 1980s, 
his son said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the German pilot who had shot down LaChasse's plane traveled to 
Glendale to meet his former enemy for an emotional reunion. The encounter had 
been arranged with the help of a Belgian journalist and historian who had 
witnessed the plane crash as a teen-ager and later began researching the event 
for a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Jan. 22, 1917, in St. Louis, LaChasse came to California with his family 
in 1921, settling in Glendale. After attending Glendale College and a stint in 
the Marine Corps, LaChasse joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son Dean, LaChasse is survived by his wife of 47 years, 
Dorothy (Dodo) LaChasse; three more sons, Scott LaChasse of Newhall, Bill 
LaChasse of Tujunga and Gary LaChasse of Gardnerville, Nev.; and four 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A funeral is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Saturday at the Church of the Hills at 
Forest Lawn's Hollywood Hills cemetery, 6300 Forest Lawn Drive, Los Angeles. A 
graveside service will follow. Forest Lawn Mortuary is handling the 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made in LaChasse's name to the 
YWCA of Glendale or to the American Heart Assn.

GO OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY FOR A NONPARTISAN PROSECUTOR; WHITEWATER: STARR'S WORK 
FOR BUSH AND REAGAN HAS THE MARKS OF THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT HIS 
APPOINTMENT WAS TO AVOID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN BYCEL, Benjamin Bycel, executive director of the Los Angeles City 
Ethics Commission, teaches ethics at the USC School of Law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will Robert Bork be appointed the new special prosecutor in the inquiry 
regarding Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy? If last week's selection of 
Republican stalwart Kenneth Starr as the special prosecutor for Whitewater is 
any indication of how the three-judge panel makes decisions, the selection of 
Bork might not be as absurd as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges are supposed to make their selection from a list of senior 
attorneys with judicial or prosecutorial experience and reputation for 
impartiality. Somehow within these guidelines, the judges managed to select an 
attorney with no prosecutorial experience and with the appearance of a conflict 
of interest that should disqualify him from heading such a controversial and 
politically loaded investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, an appearance of conflict is often different from an actual conflict 
of interest, but the judges who appointed Starr made a point of stating that 
the Special Prosecution Act "contemplates an apparent as well as actual 
independence on the part of the counsel." Further, the judges said that they 
had appointed someone who would not be subject to the "perceptions of 
conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
 But how independent can Starr be if, as the press has reported, he recently 
discussed with other lawyers plans to file a brief opposing President Clinton's 
legal position in the sexual harassment case filed by Paula Corbin Jones? 
</P>
<P>
 This single act alone, which may be an actual conflict, should have 
disqualified Starr under the appearance-of-conflict standard, but there is 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 In selecting Starr, the judges noted that it would be "in the best interest of 
the appearance of independence contemplated by the act that a person not 
affiliated with the incumbent Administration be appointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Did the court overlook that it was Bill Clinton who defeated Starr's last 
boss, George Bush? That Starr was solicitor general in the Bush Administration, 
chief of staff to William French Smith, President Reagan's attorney general, 
and a Reagan appointee to the federal Court of Appeals? 
</P>
<P>
 Appearance of independence means more than just independence from the targets 
of the investigation. A truly impartial special prosecutor must also be 
independent from those who could benefit most from the publicity and outcome of 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Washington insiders, including prominent Democrats, view Starr as a man 
of integrity who would be able to overcome his partisan background and be fair 
and impartial. 
</P>
<P>
 But it defies common sense and ambition to believe that Starr would be able to 
reconcile his loyalty to the Republican Party, his career and his duties as an 
independent prosecutor. If he is perceived by his own party to be tough on the 
Clinton Administration, it certainly would help his chance to become attorney 
general or a Supreme Court justice in the next Republican administration. But 
if the GOP leaders, especially the conservative wing, believe that he was soft 
on the President, it would not enhance his status within the party. Hardly the 
scenario for an independent prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 The subjects of the investigation are entitled to some assurances that the 
special prosecutor will not try to settle old political scores at their 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, the American people who are footing the bill for this 
operation are entitled to have a truly nonpartisan, independent prosecutor. Can 
one be found? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, if the judges were willing to look outside the Washington Beltway. There 
are hundreds of current and former U.S. attorneys and local district attorneys 
capable of handling this type of case. While these men and women may have 
nominal political affiliation, their careers have not been, like Starr's, 
entangled with the office of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 What the judges did by appointing Starr is to further muddy Whitewater and to 
give the Clinton Administration a chance to yell foul. They should not make the 
same mistake when they choose the next special prosecutor.

BLACKS AREN'T HOGGING POSTAL SERVICE JOBS; RACE RELATIONS: THE CLAIM THAT 
LATINOS ARE UNFAIRLY UNDERREPRESENTED MISSTATES THE FACTS AND IGNORES HISTORY.

 Are African Americans overrepresented in the Postal Service? 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Tirso del Junco, vice chairman of the U.S. Postal Service Board of 
Governors (and chairman of the California Republican Party), seems to think so. 
His recent comments struck a raw nerve in the African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Junco's suggestion that this overrepresentation of blacks and accompanying 
underrepresentation of Latinos is driven by local black postal executives 
further chafes the injury. His comments indicate an insensitivity to the 
economic aspirations and well-being of black America. While there is much to be 
done to increase the representation of Latinos in the Postal Service and other 
parts of the public sector, it is a false and inflammatory step to begin by 
portraying African Americans as the unfair beneficiaries and the cause of 
Latinos' underrepresentation. 
</P>
<P>
 The public sector and the Postal Service in particular played an important 
role in providing whatever economic stability the black community had before 
the civil-rights movement. Starting with the Depression, blacks found that the 
Postal Service was the only place that rewarded "merit" and where racial bias 
was minimal. The Civil Service examination for postal work enabled the best and 
brightest of blacks to shine and move up the eligibility list toward 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 For blacks in the job market during this period, having a college education or 
an advanced degree meant that more doors were closed in your face than if you 
were uneducated. The Postal Service became one of the few employers where the 
skills African Americans mastered in higher education were prized. Thus, on the 
eve of the civil-rights movement in the '60s, more blacks with bachelor's and 
graduate and professional degrees were employed by the Postal Service than by 
any other profession except teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the black community, post office work took on an exaggerated status and 
meaning: It was a "good job." Compared with most jobs blacks had, the work was 
steady, the pay good and the benefits excellent. Black postal workers wore 
their uniforms with pride and people respected them with an honor not afforded 
in other communities. Yet people also knew that despite their blue-collar 
status, black postal employees were probably college educated and had earned 
their job in competition with others. The subtitle of an Ebony article on 
blacks in the Postal Service captured the national and personal tragedy: "The 
Graveyard of Negro Talent." 
</P>
<P>
 While the civil-rights movement has leveled the playing field somewhat, it has 
not completely opened the doors of opportunity for blacks. The post office's 
legacy is alive and well in the black community. It is still a "good job." 
Taking the Civil Service exam for the Postal Service is a safety valve that 
educated black Americans still feel they need to have. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks' success in the post office is related less to racial preference than 
to the fact that more highly educated blacks continue to take the exam than do 
their white and Latino counterparts, who bypass these jobs for other more 
lucrative opportunities. Less-well-educated whites and Latinos therefore lose 
out in a merit-based exam because they cannot compete with highly educated 
blacks. The over-representation of blacks in the Postal Service today (blacks 
hold about 30% of Los Angeles-district postal jobs, while representing about 5% 
of the labor force; nationally, blacks hold about 11% of postal jobs and 
represent about 5% of the labor force) is thus just a continuing reminder that 
blacks have not found the doors of opportunity completely open to them in other 
sectors of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 What is most dismaying in Del Junco's comments, and in the whispers in the air 
among other Latino leaders, is the way in which blacks are increasingly being 
perceived as the prime culprits in Latino underrepresentation in the public 
sector. The public sector has a special historical and contemporary meaning to 
the economic well-being of the black community that should be the basis of this 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The inclusive solution to these problems is to promote the expansion of 
employment in the public sector to accommodate the growing needs -- for 
education, recreation, health, community safety -- that a diverse population 
generates. This means we must support the expansion of taxes to meet these 
needs, including a change in public spending priorities. Rather than seeking 
more and more money to put youths in prison, we need to spend to educate them. 
And we need to work for the defeat of measures like the "Save Our State" 
initiative, which would take away public services important to needy 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Only by ensuring that public policy fairly includes all people will we escape 
the racial divisiveness that Del Junco's comments tend to generate.

 Crime is on the rise. Our citizens are no longer safe in their 
neighborhoods.Recently one of our employees was going to the local bank to cash 
his first paycheck. He was abducted, beaten, slashed, robbed and dumped out 
left for dead alongside the freeway. It was hours before anyone found him. How 
do we protect ourselves from things like this? 
</P>

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BLUE JAYS STAY LATE BEFORE WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was almost as if they didn't want the season to end. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays played more than four hours 
Thursday, and most of the fans stayed in their seats until it was over, with 
the Blue Jays winning in 13 innings, 8-7, at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 37,333, including players' union head Donald Fehr, came out to 
Yankee Stadium for what may have been the final game of the season in New York. 
The players say they will strike today unless an agreement is reached with 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Carter of the Blue Jays, who ended last season with a World Series-winning 
home run, nearly finished this one with another homer. He led off the 12th 
inning with his 27th home run, but the Yankees weren't finished. They tied the 
score when Luis Polonia opened the 12th with a double, moved up on a single by 
Wade Boggs and scored on a double-play grounder by Paul O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Sprague, who drove in Toronto's first two runs with a triple, opened the 
13th with a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was strange out there," said Carter, who is the Blue Jays' player 
representative. "You look out there and see what may materialize. Fans holding 
up banners asking us not to strike. We don't want to either. This is a last 
resort." 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague's 11th home run of the season beat Joe Ausanio (2-1), who was sent to 
triple-A Columbus after the game. Darren Hall (2-3), the fourth Blue Jay 
pitcher, pitched two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto tied the score at 6-6 in the eighth against reliever Bob Wickman when 
John Olerud opened with a triple that skipped past center fielder Bernie 
Williams and Darnell Coles doubled him home. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 10, Detroit 5 -- The Brewers scored six runs in the eighth inning at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 On another day, the game might have been called. But no one wanted a rainout 
on the eve of a walkout. So, the Brewers and Tigers spent nearly three hours 
playing cards and eating doughnuts while the start of the game was delayed 
because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it started, Jody Reed lined the first pitch from Mike Moore up the middle 
for a single, setting the tone for the rest of the free-swinging contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee scored six in the eighth on five hits, including Reed's two-run 
double, two errors and a wild pitch.

 Defending champion Michael Chang and third-seeded Michael Stich had their 
matches interrupted twice by rain Thursday before advancing to the 
quarterfinals of the $1.72 million ATP Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-seeded Boris Becker of Germany, however, fell to Amos Mansdorf of 
Israel, 7-6 (7-1), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-seeded Jim Courier came back from a 1 hour, 23-minute delay to beat 
Sandon Stolle of Australia, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is tough to keep your mind together when you have to go in three times," 
said Stich of Germany, who beat Jim Grabb, 6-2, 6-7 (7-4), 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't played a better server," Grabb said. "The velocity and direction -- 
I should have paid extra for the serving lessons." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, seeded fourth, beat 13th-seeded Cedric Pioline of France, 6-2, 3-6, 
6-3. Today, he will face Jason Stoltenberg of Australia, who beat 12th-seeded 
Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, 6-0, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I played a near-perfect match," said Stoltenberg, who has been the 
hottest player on the ATP Tour during the past two months. "It was one of those 
days when everything went the right way." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg is 16-3 in his past four tournaments and has moved up to a 
career-high 22nd in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each day I get on the court I feel better and better," he said. "I like to 
think it's just a lot of hard work paying off." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg had shoulder surgery a year ago, but has come back better than 
ever, living up to the promise he showed as the world's top-ranked junior 
player.  
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Stefan Edberg, also re-establishing his game, ousted MaliVai 
Washington, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play a bad match," said Becker of his loss to Mansdorf. "It wasn't 
like a terrible loss. He is a strong player." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansdorf has knocked two seeded players out of the tournament.

BOOTH LOSES IN QUARTERFINALS OF U.S. WOMEN'S AMATEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kellee Booth's run at the U.S. Women's Amateur title ended Thursday when she 
lost in the quarterfinal round at the Cascades Course in Hot Springs, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Booth, from Coto de Caza, was eliminated, 2 and 1, by Andrea Baxter, a 
19-year-old Stanford sophomore from Eagle, Idaho.Booth will play for Arizona 
State this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Booth needed 19 holes Thursday morning to defeat Angela Buzminski of Canada in 
the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter plays Wendy Ward of San Antonio in one semifinal today. Ward, who is 
from Arizona State, was the runner-up in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The other semifinal is between defending champion Jill McGill, who plans to 
turn pro after this event and Emilee Klein, the 1994 NCAA champion. Klein also 
plans to turn pro this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 McGill had 10 birdies and two eagles in the 31 holes she needed to win two 
matches Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't really think about winning the tournament when it's Monday and 
there's 147 players here," she said. "But when you get down to the last 16 or 
so, it's hard not to. You just get more pumped up the deeper you get into the 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 McGill, who recently finished her college career at USC, had six birdies and 
an eagle in a 2-and-1 victory over England's Lisa Walton in the round of 16. In 
the quarterfinals, McGill had four birdies and an eagle on the way to a 5-and-4 
triumph over Joellyn Erdmann of Little Chute, Wis.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND YIELDS UP ON RATE HIKE FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-term government bond yields rose to their highest levels in almost a 
month Thursday as renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve Board will 
again raise interest rates contributed to a weak government auction for 30-year 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe's first interest rate increases in two years and a weaker dollar helped 
fuel the decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The benchmark 30-year bond yield rose to 7.65%, eight basis points higher than 
Wednesday. The long bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction, 
dropped 29/32 of a point, or $9.06 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield rose to 7.68%, the highest since July 14, immediately after the bond 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The year's high yield is 7.75% on July 11. The two-year note yield was 6.24%, 
up from 6.17%. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields rose early in the day after government statistics on inflation and 
retail sales persuaded many traders that the nation's central bank will boost 
short-term rates for the fifth time this year. Most analysts expect another 
hike of a quarter to half a percentage point next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said the producer price index -- measuring inflation at 
the wholesale level -- shot up 0.5% in July, the highest increase in 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the underlying inflation rate, excluding volatile energy and food 
prices, was up only 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing more heavily on the market, analysts said, were upward revisions by 
the Commerce Department in its May and June retail sales figures, indicating 
healthy demand into the second half of the year, despite a slight 0.1% decline 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic reports arrived just hours before major bond firms bid on the 
$11-billion new Treasury issue, which drew an average yield of 7.56%, above 
traders' expectations of 7.55%. The high yield was 7.59%, above the anticipated 
7.57%. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the difference between the average and the high yield -- known 
as the tail -- was three basis points at a 30-year bond auction was in May, 
1991. A wide tail indicates the major firms intentionally submitted high-yield 
bids to avoid winning many securities. 
</P>
<P>
 A falling dollar also contributed to the price decline by apparently giving 
another reason for the Fed to tighten. Higher interest rates tend to boost the 
dollar's value because foreign investors buy dollars to take advantage of the 
greater returns in dollar-denominated investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The central banks of Sweden and Italy said they would raise interest rates. 
Sweden's move was the first rate increase by a European central bank in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 As European rates jumped, reducing the attractiveness of the return on 
dollar-denominated assets, the U.S. currency slipped to a three-week low 
against the mark and dropped against the yen. The dollar closed in New York at 
1.561 marks, down from 1.584 and the lowest level since July 18. It also fell 
to 100.23 Japanese yen, down from 101.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on Wall Street, stock prices tumbled along with bond prices 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 15.86 points at 3,750.90. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 13 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume totaled 275.67 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Some technology issues continued to show some buoyancy, allowing the Nasdaq 
composite index to finish unchanged at 728.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, stock investors were biding their time until the Fed's Open Market 
Committee meets next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks began the day extending a two-day winning streak. They 
lost some ground later in the session but still outperformed the rest of the 
market. Compaq fell 1/8 to 35, but Micron Technology finished up 1/8 at 42 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel rose 5/8 to 60 3/8, Microsoft gained 1 1/8 to 55 1/4, Sybase advanced 
1 11/16 to 43 15/16, and Lotus Development gained 1 to 41 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 But Apple fell 5/16 to 34 5/16 and Seagate Technology dropped 1 to 26. 
</P>
<P>
 * Skin and hair care products maker Neutrogena soared 4 7/8 to 26 1/2 on a 
Salomon Bros. report that Johnson & Johnson may be seeking to acquire it. J&J 
slipped 5/8 to 47 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Economically sensitive stocks weakened. Ford Motor fell 1/2 to 29 3/4, 
International Paper lost 7/8 to 74 1/8, and Caterpillar tumbled 1 1/2 to 103. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Gap shot up 4 3/8 to 41 1/4 after the retailer reported second-quarter 
net earnings of 30 cents a share, up from 20 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks were mixed. London shares finished sharply lower as worries 
over interest rates returned. The Financial Times 100-share average was down 
28.8 points at 3,138.2. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average closed 5.09 points 
down at 2,155.28. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average ended up 51.11 points 
at 20,821.36. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index closed up 22.22 points at 2,596.89.

currently has the No. 1 single from the "Reality Bites" soundtrack.Geffen is 
also very close to inking highly coveted Chicago band Veruca Salt, which would 
join recently signed bands Elastica and Loud Lucy. The label is also heating up 
the marketplace as Counting Crows continues its Top Five sales and Weezer,

RAMS; RAM CORNERBACKS DRAWING INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers will have a scout at Saturday night's Ram-Patriot 
exhibition game to look over Ram cornerbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers lack a solid No. 3 cornerback and the Rams appear overloaded at 
the position with Darryl Henley, Robert Bailey, Terry Taylor and Wymon 
Henderson supporting starters' Todd Lyght and Steve Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' defensive coaching staff might find it difficult to part with a 
corner because of their experiences last year when a rash of injuries left them 
playing with guys off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the team's front office is looking ahead to the final cut to 53, and 
its ramifications on the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are also trying to deal a veteran wide receiver and a running back. 
Veteran wide receivers' Jessie Hester and Greg McMurtry are long shots to make 
the final roster. Veteran Nate Lewis, who is currently working as a starter and 
who is one of the better paid players on offense, might have trouble holding 
his spot with the emergence of Isaac Bruce, the team's second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is known to be disappointed in the play of running back James Bostic, 
a third-round pick this year from Auburn, and does not expect to have room on 
its roster for running back Howard Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Gary, who was the subject of trade talks a year ago, is not expected 
to be on the market this exhibition season. Although Johnny Bailey has emerged 
as the favorite to be the team's third-down running back, Gary's first- and 
second-down services are required as insurance because of the team's 
overwhelming reliance on Jerome Bettis. T.J. SIMERS

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; LEGROOM VARIABLE CONFUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I have been shopping for a car and am completely confused by the 
dimensions quoted by different manufacturers. One model is listed with 42 
inches of legroom, but it seems to have less than another model that is listed 
as having 41 inches. Is one of these companies lying? -- G.G. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It isn't intended as a lie; however, the auto industry has caused a 
lot of confusion among motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the industry sets standards on everything from motor-oil viscosity to 
windshield visibility, there are no strict rules on where the front seat should 
be positioned when measuring front and rear legroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, manufacturers measure with the front seat moved partway forward 
-- which increases the amount of rear legroom that is quoted. The problem comes 
in comparing these figures with those of another manufacturer that measures 
with the seat moved all the way back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), which sets standards for measuring 
dimensions, has a complex formula for defining where to put the seat when 
measuring. But following the formula is voluntary, and Japanese and European 
companies often don't follow the standard.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need to streamline the practice," said Ronald Roe, chairman of the SAE 
committee that develops such standards. "We have 40 years of history associated 
with these practices. We are slowly making progress." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the matter is complicated because manufacturers have increased the 
"track travel" (the distance the seat can be moved) from an average of six 
inches in the 1960s to 12 inches today. When measuring, the seat must be set in 
a position that accommodates the majority of the public, since the seat 
position affects other specifications as well, Roe said. 
</P>
<P>
 To find the car with the most front legroom, forget the specification charts. 
You have to rely on your judgment or make your own measurements. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar problem occurs with trunk-volume specifications. The SAE has two 
ways to measure trunk volume. Under the American system, the manufacturer 
counts the volume of a series of large oblong and square boxes that can be 
fitted into the trunk. But the SAE also allows a European method, which uses 
much smaller boxes. The two methods can produce different results even in the 
same trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where shopping is invaluable. All the brochures in the world are not 
going to tell you whether your golf clubs or backpack will actually fit into a 
particular trunk.

 All-night cram sessions may not be such a good idea after all. Researchers 
report that deep slumber plays an important role in learning, and, without it, 
hard-earned knowledge can disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study published in the journal Science, scientists at the Weizmann 
Institute in Rehovot, Israel, report that test subjects allowed to get a solid 
night's sleep had an improved memory of a task taught to them the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, six test subjects were taught a simple repetitive task during an 
eight-hour training session. They were allowed to sleep and then retested. The 
researchers found that after sleep, the test subjects performed better than 
they had at the end of the training session. This suggested that some process 
occurred during sleep that strengthened the learning. 
</P>
<P>
 In another study, researchers at the University of Arizona showed that cells 
in the brains of rats that were stimulated during a learning process were also 
stimulated during sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding is consistent, the researchers said, with the belief that 
knowledge gained while awake is somehow reinforced, or consolidated, during 
sleep.

 F. James Rutherford, director of Project 2061 for the American Assn. for the 
Advancement of Science, said students get "engrossed, putting together the 
elements of a contest. . . . But many times when you look at what the kids 
actually do, you realize that somehow or other the science gets lost."  
</P>
<P>
 They'll learn more if schools allow the students to simply explain their 
projects to one another, he said.

MIKE DOWNEY: BASEBALL PLAYERS ON STRIKE / A SEASON HANGS IN THE BALANCE; TIME'S 
UP ON NATIONAL PASTIME; OWNERS HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They did not always make millions. Dave Stewart of the Toronto Blue Jays got 
nostalgic as the baseball strike deadline loomed, remembering when he 
moonlighted while pitching for the Dodgers by working at a warehouse, boxing 
nuts and bolts. Relief pitcher Steve Howe of the New York Yankees reacted 
similarly, saying, "If I have to pound nails for a living, I'll do it. I've 
done it before." 
</P>
<P>
 Working in hardware won't be necessary. The players will win this rich-boy tug 
of war. The players will win and the owners will lose, whether the strike lasts 
a day, a week or a winter. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot play ball without ballplayers. The owners will capitulate, sooner 
or later, bet on sooner, because without these particular workers, their 
companies cannot function. The business is baseball, but the American public 
will never indulge American Legion players masquerading as American League 
players. There will be no scab labor, not now, not ever. There will be pro 
baseball or no baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 How foolhardy it was for an emissary of the owners to suggest that too many 
teams are losing money, that in essence baseball's big daddies need to cut off 
their children's allowance. This insults the intellect of the players, among 
them Howe, who railed at management mouthpiece Richard Ravitch: "How do you 
expect us to trust anything you say when (someone claims) the Los Angeles 
Dodgers are losing money, or the White Sox are losing money, or the Chicago 
Cubs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said, "I never . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all a bunch of crap and you know it," Howe cut him off. "You wonder why 
we don't believe you, and then you try to tell us the Dodgers could lose money 
this season or next season or the season after that." 
</P>
<P>
 At times it is difficult to argue whether we live in a time of prosperity when 
the Dodgers are dimming lamp lights in the parking lot an hour earlier, or when 
the Angels begin charging eight bucks for a previously free lunch, or when the 
Texas Rangers put 150 full-time employees on notice that their take-home pay 
will be slashed 10% on the first of next month, should their favorite players 
be marching in a picket line outside that door. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as the players' union leader, Don Fehr, correctly put it, "If the owners 
have problems, they have to solve them, not the players." 
</P>
<P>
 The players have a nest egg of $175 to $200 million in their emergency fund to 
see them through a layoff. They are not about to be scolded, in this day and 
age, that there must be a limit to their earning power, not by captains of 
industry who are free to make as much as they can wheelbarrow to the bank. It 
is not their fault that basketball or football players were such suckers that 
they fell for that salary-cap thing, keeping lawyers busy looking for 
loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why pitcher Terry Mulholland of the Philadelphia Phillies protested 
vehemently, "They keep talking about cost certainty, but that's not what they 
mean. When they say 'cost certainty,' what they mean is 'profit certainty.' How 
do you think New York Giants' fans feel about what happened to Phil Simms after 
the Giants decided they couldn't fit Simms under the salary cap? Do you think 
they think it's fair?" 
</P>
<P>
 Howe chimed in, "The players will never agree to this cap. Not in 1994, or 
1995, or 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 And pitcher Curt Schilling even got right in Ravitch's face, saying, "By the 
way, Dick, what's the number of teams losing money today?" 
</P>
<P>
 The owners are in deep sheep-dip, and they know it. Already, prominent ones 
such as George Steinbrenner of the Yankees and Jerry Reinsdorf of the White Sox 
have begun to buckle, calling for Ravitch to reconsider his strategy in 
forbidding owners to sit at the bargaining table. Steinbrenner appealed that 
people with a vested interest become involved, rather than "a bunch of lawyers 
who are the only ones who are going to make money out of a strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinbrenner went on to implore Ravitch to stop insisting that baseball's 
competitive balance could be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to get off that," the Yankee owner said. "Look at Montreal. The best 
record in baseball is the team with the second-lowest payroll." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners are bending and will break. Peter Angelos said as owner of the 
Baltimore Orioles, he would be willing to pledge that no salary cap be 
implemented after this season, as a gesture to the players, at least until 
independent accounting firms could audit the teams' financial records. What 
many of the owners dread most, opening their books, is inevitable, or else they 
can never prove their point. 
</P>
<P>
 Incensed that they are being treated like clowns who have no idea what it 
takes to run a circus, Schilling railed at Ravitch on behalf of the players: 
"You know one of your problems, Dick? You talk down to us all the time. You're 
condescending. You treat us like we're not informed and we are informed." 
</P>
<P>
 The players will win this strike, because there is no turning back now. It was 
1981 when Stewart broke in with the Dodgers and was paid $21,500, total. He 
recalled: "That was $13,000 after taxes. Living on $13,000 in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 That was why he took a second job, loading crates at a company that 
manufactured fasteners. But that was also the year major leaguers walked out 
and stayed out, for 50 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said, "Had the union not struck in '81, the position I'm in now would 
not be as stable as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 He is in the second year of a two-year contract worth $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The players will win this strike and the owners will lose, because the players 
have too much to lose. They are entertainers who will set their price, not be 
told it. The owners can take it or leave it. They will take it. Tomorrow, a 
week from tomorrow, a year from tomorrow, it doesn't matter. They will take it. 
Divided They Stand 
</P>
<P>
 How the players and owners differ on the issues that led to the strike: 
PLAYERS' PROPOSALS 
</P>
<P>
 * Free agency: Eliminate the restriction on repeat free agency within a 
five-year span if a player's club offers salary arbitration at the end of his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary arbitration: Reduce the threshold to two years of major league 
service, its level in 1974-86. It currently is three years plus the top 17% of 
the players with between two and three years of major league service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Minimum salary: Increase from $109,000 to $175,000-$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pensions: Increase the levels for players who played before 1970. OWNERS' 
PROPOSALS 
</P>
<P>
 -- 50-50 revenue split with players with a $1-billion total guaranteed over 
seven years if revenue doesn't decrease. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After a four-year phase-in period in a seven-year agreement, clubs couldn't 
have payrolls more than 110% of the average or less than 84% of the average. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Salary arbitration eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free agency threshold would drop from six years of major league service to 
four, but players' clubs would be able to match the highest offer until they 
have six years' service. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Escalating scale of minimum salaries for players with less than four years' 
major league service, but they could sign for more than the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Acceptance by players would trigger the agreement clubs made with each 
other in January to increase revenue that is shared among teams.

 There are enough theories to satisfy the most dedicated mystery buff. 
</P>
<P>
 This much is certain: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The players will never accept the owners' proposed salary cap. A negotiated 
settlement can become possible only if the owners find a way to save face and 
withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The owners, divided and defeated in the seven previous stoppages since 
1972, have asked for so much this time that they will assuredly emerge from any 
negotiated settlement with a measure of satisfaction and economic gain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Both owners and players face significant financial pressure, but the 
union's winning streak translates to unquestioned unanimity. The owners' 
alleged resolve is far more suspect, as underscored by the criticisms leveled 
at chief negotiator Richard Ravitch by New York Yankee owner George 
Steinbrenner, Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos and Cincinnati Red owner 
Marge Schott on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Less certain is the following: 
</P>
<P>
 There are probably nine bigger-market or bigger-revenue clubs, some biting the 
bullet on increased revenue sharing but only if it is tied to a salary cap, 
that would just as soon forget the whole thing and continue under the current 
system -- if the choice is that or a prolonged strike.  
</P>
<P>
 The nine are the Atlanta Braves, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, New York 
Yankees and Mets, Texas Rangers, Colorado Rockies, Orioles and Dodgers, whose 
owner, Peter O'Malley, insists publicly that he fully supports Ravitch and the 
pursuit of a new compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 A settlement must be approved by 21 of the 28 teams, meaning eight 
smaller-market or smaller-revenue teams can hold up any agreement that does not 
include a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven clubs definitely fit that category -- the Seattle Mariners, San Diego 
Padres, Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals, Minnesota Twins, Pittsburgh 
Pirates and Montreal Expos, who have mixed emotions in a now-threatened season 
in which they have produced baseball's best record. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves 12 other teams -- some big, some small, some in the middle -- 
currently lining up in public support of the salary-cap proposal. But they may 
be vulnerable to arm twisting by the bigger-market nine if there is a mutiny 
aimed at overcoming the minority rule and reaching a settlement by Labor Day, 
as some think possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 who could go either way are the Angels, Chicago Cubs and White Sox, St. 
Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, Houston Astros, 
Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, Florida Marlins, Cleveland Indians and Oakland 
Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles, Yankees, Red Sox and Blue Jays are believed to be the clubs most 
likely to lead any early attempt to compromise the salary-cap proposal or 
overthrow Ravitch, who begins the strike insisting that not one club has called 
to suggest modifying the proposal and who doesn't have the authority to do it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the often splintered and self-centered owners in these 
confrontations -- would Steinbrenner have broken from the pack Thursday if his 
Yankees weren't leading the American League East, and would newcomer Angelos 
have opened up vocally if he hadn't spent $173 million to buy the Orioles and 
they weren't regularly selling out Camden Yards? -- suggests they will crack at 
some point. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it can also be theorized that this has been a well-orchestrated plan 
designed ultimately to produce an impasse, enabling the owners to unilaterally 
implement their new system, a sort of all-for-one, line-in-the-sand gambit 
aimed at finally breaking the union. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners, after all, refrained from hiring a commissioner who might 
interfere with the plan. The office has been vacant since Sept. 7, 1992. They 
boxed the union into a corner by waiting 18 months after reopening the 
collective negotiations before presenting their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 And although they will absorb substantial financial and public relations hits 
if baseball is shut down until 1995 or beyond, the price may not be that great 
when weighed against the opportunity to install a system that includes the cap, 
elimination of salary arbitration and modification -- the union calls it death 
-- of free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have $140 million in TV revenue at stake in postseason play but 
that's only $5 million per club, a small down payment, they may believe, for 
acquiring the salary limitations and "cost certainty" of their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 How the union would react to a unilateral move isn't clear. The players have 
never been pushed that far. They could protest to the National Labor Relations 
Board or renew their strike at the start of the 1995 season, but . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Would they have signed new contracts under the new system? Would a 
unilaterally implemented system take effect immediately or be phased in? Can 
the owners satisfactorily prove there is an impasse? 
</P>
<P>
 It is also uncertain where a compromise rests if the owners don't take it to 
impasse and there is pressure from the bigger-market clubs for an early 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious speculation rests with this scenario: The owners take salary cap 
off the table. The players then give up salary arbitration in return for 
unrestricted free agency after three or four years of major league service, 
rather than the current six. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the players agree to give up arbitration? Sources indicate that they 
would if they were certain they were getting an earlier free agency uninhibited 
by any "right of first refusal" restriction or threatened by collusion. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, however, Ravitch says that elimination of arbitration alone 
won't solve the industry's economic problems or provide cost certainty for the 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 And Don Fehr, executive director of the players' union, says he doesn't expect 
the clubs to isolate arbitration because arbitration actually works to the 
benefit of the small markets. By tendering arbitration, Fehr says, they are 
pretty much able to estimate costs and retain players who might otherwise leave 
if there were earlier free agency and no arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the possibility, urged Thursday by Angelos, that the owners will 
pledge not to implement their system at the end of the season if the players 
return to work and pledge not to strike through 1995. Ravitch, however, says 
the owners have already discussed that and chose not to give up the impasse 
option. Fehr suggests that it is too late in the game for pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the preemptive strike by a union that believes this is what the owners 
wanted from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 How long will it last? How will it end? Only time will tell. Perhaps, a very 
long time.

WORLD CUP OF BASKETBALL IS STILL NOTHING BUT A DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Based on current evidence, basketball's World Championships may realize NBA 
Commissioner David Stern's dream of matching soccer's World Cup but needs time 
to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 How about 5,000 years? 
</P>
<P>
 Dinosaurs will walk the earth again first and not just in "The Flintstones." 
Soccer sells out 100,000-seat stadiums with average ticket prices of more than 
$300 in corners of the globe -- like ours -- where the game is a rumor. This 
tournament went a week before selling out a 17,000-seat arena. 
</P>
<P>
 When Canada lost to Greece a few days ago in Maple Leaf Gardens, the crowd was 
11,083, most of them Greek-Canadians waving blue and white flags and drowning 
out fans of the home team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't comment on that," Canadian Coach Ken Shields said. "But you know, 
it's pretty hard for Canadian kids playing for their home country to get booed 
in our building." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. entry, known as "Dream Team II" but rarely outside TV ads, is hardly 
the glamour item its predecessor was. This team's first three games in nearby 
Hamilton played to about 70% of capacity. Opponents did not ask for autographs 
or to pose with the U.S. players for pictures as they did with the real Dream 
Team. 
</P>
<P>
 The original Dream Team was made up of legends. These are just guys, however 
famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing you did when you started a game was take a picture with 
Michael Jordan and Magic (Johnson) and (Scottie) Pippen," said Puerto Rico 
Coach Carlos Morales, an assistant on the 1992 team in the Olympic qualifying 
tournament at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was our standard procedure before every game. And then when we were 
guarding somebody, the guy who was guarding, let's say, Magic, was watching the 
bench so somebody would have his camera and take a picture. It was the biggest 
moment of our players' lives just being on the same court with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The players on this team, trying to live up to their elders' legend, have 
solved the problem with a party atmosphere, firing themselves up while rubbing 
opponents' noses in ignominious defeats. This has not been as popular -- 
opponents are complaining -- as it has been effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going back to the traditional basketball when you dunk it and run down 
the court," Reggie Miller said. "Well, you're in the new age now." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the U.S. players are only doing what they do every day at home. 
The NBA game is shot through with styling, woofing, intimidation and attempts 
to cultivate a personality suitable for getting into TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Don Nelson, a hard driver in the days before "the new age," has 
acknowledged that he exerts little influence over his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is here to make friends, for American basketball and perhaps a few for 
himself, which may be why he has lavished such praise on Shaquille O'Neal, 
comparing him to Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain, even saying at one point, 
"I know we'll be friends for the rest of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally or not, Nelson can get out of his Golden State contract in a 
season, and O'Neal's coach in Orlando, Brian Hill, is on shaky ground. 
</P>
<P>
 If Canadian crowds eat up the American dunk-o-ramas, back in the States where 
people have seen Shaq dunk once or twice, this tournament is a yawner. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from its European hotbed or the Olympic spotlight, international 
basketball is a second-rate carny show. Before the NBA decided that this 
tournament had marketing possibilities, it meant nothing in the United States, 
which sent hastily chosen squads. Only two American Hall of Famers ever 
participated, and one -- Bill Walton -- was a 17-year-old coming out of high 
school who played in one game. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, U.S. officials advertised an open tryout in an Air Force newspaper 
and fielded a team made up solely of servicemen. In 1978, Athletes in Action 
represented the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Real interest requires that the Americans send their best players, which has 
happened, and the rest of the world catch up, which is another thing 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 If an American team may well lose a game before anyone imagines -- simply 
because few can imagine it -- real competition is years away, or decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the level of play overseas has improved dramatically, the pool of 
players capable of crashing the NBA has mysteriously dried up. In the 1980s, 
European basketball narrowed a gap thought insurmountable, developing a 
generation of NBA players: Vlade Divac, Drazen Petrovic, Sarunas Marciulionis, 
Dino Radja, Toni Kukoc. Lithuania's 7-foot-4 Arvidas Sabonis, the greatest of 
the Europeans and a Portland draft choice, didn't come because of an Achilles' 
tendon injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 26-year-old Kukoc was the last of the prodigies. NBA scouts are here 
in force, but beyond Toni, there is only international basketball's Missing 
Generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a void there," says Donn Nelson, Don's son and the man who, as a 
Warrior assistant, spent months in Lithuania recruiting Marciulionis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep talking about cycles whenever I go over there," the younger Nelson 
said. "They talk about, 'These years were great years for basketball, the year 
Sarunas was born.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean Lithuania had Sarunas, Sabonis, Rimas Kurtinaitis (the jump shooter 
who gunned the U.S. collegians down while playing for the Soviet Union in the 
1988 Seoul Olympics), Valdemaras Khomichius. All those were great players from 
that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got other things to worry about. Their minds are not on leisure 
activities right now. You know, they're experiencing real turmoil. You're not 
seeing the great young players because there's not as much of an emphasis right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in junior competition, matching players of the same age, international 
teams are routinely beating American squads, hinting at another spurt overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 This one will look different, however. Instead of coming to America as 
established professional stars, more foreign players will attend colleges here, 
as did Germany's Detlef Schrempf and Nigeria's Hakeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Belorussia has an excellent young team that won the World Championships," 
Nelson said. "One of their kids, Alexander Koul, is going to be playing for 
Mike Jarvis at George Washington. Excellent prospect. They've got another small 
forward who is better than Arturas Karnishiovas, who went to Seton Hall and is 
an NBA prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The colleges are getting more and more knowledgeable about the talent that's 
over there, especially after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Times are tough 
over there, and (players) are happy to come over here. And they don't know the 
difference between Wright State and UCLA. They just know it's America." 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament ends this weekend with huge crowds expected at SkyDome. It 
won't be like Duke-UNLV in the Final Four or Brazil-Italy in soccer's World 
Cup, but as that first one-celled organism that crawled out of the sea millions 
of years ago could tell you, you've got to start somewhere. World Basketball 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament's semifinalists are set -- the United States, Croatia, Russia 
and Greece. The pairings will be decided by tonight's concluding quarterfinal 
games. Dream Team II, the U.S. entry and prohibitive favorite, plays Russia, 
and Croatia meets Greece, the only semifinalist to have lost a game. The final 
four teams are a combined 19-1. The winners and losers criss-cross in 
Saturday's semifinals, with those winners playing for the title and the losers 
for the bronze medal.

<P>
 Richard Matienzo, a 6-foot-6 center who leads the Cuban team in scoring in the 
tournament, is seeking refugee status in Canada, the Canadian Press reported 
Thursday. Matienzo left the team after a practice Thursday morning in Toronto 
and contacted two Toronto newspapers asking for help in staying in Canada after 
the tournament ends Sunday.

DODGERS WIN BUT DON'T FEEL LIKE VICTORS; BASEBALL: RAMON MARTINEZ PROMPTS BRIEF 
CELEBRATION WITH SPARKLING COMPLETE GAME, BUT STRIKE CLOUDS 2-0 VICTORY OVER 
THE REDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda was the last one out of the clubhouse Thursday, and who 
knows how many more times he will make that exit?  
</P>
<P>
 Who knows anything? 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, after beating the Cincinnati Reds, 2-0, with an exceptional 
complete game by Ramon Martinez, returned to Los Angeles as a team, but that 
concept ended around midnight. Today, it's the players on one side and 
management on the other, as the players' strike gets under way.  
</P>
<P>
 "You know when we will feel it?" Lasorda asked. "When we don't go to the 
ballpark tomorrow. We are programmed that we are going to play the next game. 
Then all of a sudden you don't see yourself at the ballpark and that's when you 
begin to feel the effects of it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the final batter, Eddie Taubensee, flied out to Brett Butler, the players 
in the dugout charged on the field, Kevin Gross raising his arms in victory. 
The Dodgers are in first place in the National League West, 3 1/2 games ahead 
of the San Francisco Giants and may already have won the division championship, 
depending on the length of the strike. That is not, though, what Gross or the 
others were celebrating.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they were applauding Martinez, who had last thrown six days ago. He 
had returned home to Glendale for the birth of his baby daughter and arrived 
here about 8:30 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were saying to me, 'Have another kid,' laughed Martinez, who held the 
Reds to seven hits, walking two and striking out seven.  
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (12-7) is having his best season in two years. So is Gross, who is 
9-7 with a 3.60 earned-run average, lowest among the starters. But the Dodgers 
as a whole are having their best season since 1991, even if their record of 
58-56 is only one game better than after 114 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Wallach hit his 23rd home run Thursday against Jose Rijo (9-6). Raul 
Mondesi, a virtual lock for rookie of the year, got his league-leading 16th 
assist, making a key play in the seventh inning that staved off the Reds' 
biggest threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixteen assists. Not too bad for the first year, huh?" Mondesi said.  
</P>
<P>
 The players say the finality of the game will probably hit them today, once 
they realize that their only trip to Dodger Stadium will be to clean out their 
lockers. The Dodgers, who were to have begun a three-game series with the 
Chicago Cubs tonight, have 48 games remaining on their regular-season schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will probably hit me tomorrow, or maybe on the ride home, that we won't be 
playing tomorrow," said Wallach, who was last off in the summer during the 1981 
strike. "It hasn't sunk in yet. The fans are the ones who will take the brunt 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Treadway was given permission to drive home with his family to Griffin, 
Ga., from Cincinnati, and said he will let his apartment in Los Angeles sit for 
now. "I haven't been home this time of year in a long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood in the clubhouse before the game was business as usual, with 
Martinez, celebrating the birth of his daughter, passing out cigars. Whatever 
the players could take care of ahead of time, they did. They had already talked 
about picking up luggage, the situation with clubhouse access, and Thursday 
compiled a list of their addresses and telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Player representative Brett Butler, holding court with reporters for the 100th 
time or so in the last week, was talking about what a good baseball season this 
is -- or was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about something else and then (a reporter) told me that I 
would be losing $19,000 a day, plus change," Butler said. "That's something I 
will never get back, but I'm doing it for all the Catfish Hunters and the 
(Andy) Messersmiths. It's my responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler believes the strike has to be over by mid-September if there is to be 
postseason play, but says the players know that this isn't a vacation. They 
were told not to work out as a group, since that might be interpreted as a sign 
of weakness by the owners. But they do intend to stay in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser likened his workout plans to a corporate venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make your choice of what your corporation will do," he said. "My 
corporation prefers to stay in shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger management was ready, too. The front office has held meetings, 
assigning the coaches to minor league visits, which is what Fred Claire, 
executive vice president, will also do. Claire also sent pitcher Ismael Valdes 
down to the Albuquerque Dukes after the game, to keep him pitching and to make 
sure he has a pitcher prepared to start a game if the strike ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The incongruity of it all has struck nearly everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pretty wild," pitcher Rudy Seanez said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the uncertainty cuts deeper than the strike. There are 10 potential free 
agents at the end of this season, and they don't know if they will be back, or 
if there will even be negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm light-hearted about it right now because I think there is still a chance 
that the whole season will not be canceled," said Hershiser, whose contract 
expires this season. "But as the strike wears on, it will be closer and closer 
to reality. So there is definitely a good middle of the strike story coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's just an abstract thing that the season will be canceled -- I 
would say it's a 10% possibility and 90% not possible -- but the longer the 
strike goes, those percentages will change."  
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda will be on a plane shortly, off to visit some of the minor league 
teams, including a stop to see Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort, who both pitch 
for the San Antonio Missions. Lasorda's contract is up this year also, but he 
says he never thinks about it.  
</P>
<P>
 "The only time I think about it is when (reporters) bring it up," Lasorda 
said. "I've been with them for 45 years and I'm sure when the time comes, they 
will tell me whether they want me back or want someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Butler, saying he is an optimist, was hoping the union and owners 
would pull out an agreement in the 11th hour Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe if the strike goes beyond the allotted time (the winter), it will 
destroy baseball," he said.

closed since July 19 when four ceiling tiles fell into the empty stands before 
a game. King County officials this week estimated that fixing the ceiling could 
cost as much as $7.7 million.

PGA CHAMPIONSHIP / DAILY REPORT; DEFENDING CHAMPION AZINGER FEELS GOOD ABOUT 
ANGER AFTER BAD ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the months he was being treated for cancer and could not play golf, Paul 
Azinger often thought how he would play when he came back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envisioned shooting a 64 and being in the headlines of every paper in the 
world," Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a firm believer that you can become what you see yourself becoming." 
</P>
<P>
 After he shot a 75 Thursday in the first round of the PGA Championship, 
Azinger saw himself becoming angry, which was good, about shooting five over 
par, which was bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here for a walk in the park," Azinger said. "My expectations are such 
that I thought I could compete here. It's good I'm aggravated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing hurts, I'm ready, I expect to play better." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger's round included seven bogeys, but also two birdies, both of them on 
the back nine, which he played at par. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be interpreted as a good sign, although not nearly as good as the 
news Azinger got when he was told he was cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger missed nine months after lymphoma was discovered in his shoulder. 
After chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, Azinger got to play golf again last 
week at the Buick Open, where he failed to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the defending PGA champion, but a successful defense of his title isn't 
the issue here, where making the cut would be a great achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger said his putting and iron play need work, but that's probably normal 
after a nine-month layoff. But it's just golf, not life or death, not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably a more famous player than I ever would have been if I'd have won 
five majors, because of the cancer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus, who shot a 79, had to par the last three holes to break 80. 
</P>
<P>
 It tied his worst round in 33 PGA Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus, 54, has won five PGA Championship titles, but has made only one cut 
in seven non-senior events this year, tying for 28th at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's John Daly's explanation about his comments that many players on the PGA 
Tour use drugs: "It's just something that was taken out of content." 
</P>
<P>
 There are 40 club pros in the 151-player field, a number that probably will be 
trimmed in the future to improve the quality of entries. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the club pros, George Bowman of Orchard Lake, Mich., had a tough day. 
His 87, the worst score of the day, included six consecutive 5s to start, only 
one of them par. THOMAS BONK

RAMS HOPE THEIR FAITH IN ROBINSON WILL FINALLY PAY DIVIDENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Based on results, you would have to say defensive end Gerald Robinson is a 
stiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Three disastrous years in Minnesota, two forgettable campaigns with the 
Chargers, and consider last season: The Rams paid Robinson $1.3 million and 
received three sacks in return. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no charges of extortion or blackmail filed against Robinson, 
but still you wonder just what he has on these teams to remain employed for 
nine years in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the guy," said George Dyer, Ram defensive coordinator. "This is a guy 
who will throw his body around. He's not a guy who wants to live forever. He 
knows he's paid well to give it up and he will give it up." 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the problem -- poor aim? He throws his body at the quarterback all 
the time, but just misses? The guy's primary assignment during his career has 
been to tackle the quarterback, and to date he is averaging 2.4 sacks -- a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My career has been very disappointing to me," Robinson said, "and I'm quite 
sure it's been very disappointing to other people, too." 
</P>
<P>
 No excuses, Robinson said, his career careened off course from almost the 
beginning, but he has not surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I start the whole year at right defensive end," Robinson said, "I know I 
will be a double-figures sack guy." 
</P>
<P>
 You have to scoff -- until you spend the time to talk to the big stiff, ah, 
guy. Dyer has tried to explain it: "I know what you're saying, but I'm telling 
you the guy's tough, real tough, and I think he's capable of having a big year. 
Talk to him, you'll see, there's something special there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dyer made his pitch on behalf of Robinson before the Rams' exhibition opener 
with Green Bay, but then no one was paying attention. Two sacks against the 
Packers, however, put Robinson in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm a player," Robinson said. "I've just been asked to do things that 
haven't always been in my best interests as a football player. It's been very 
frustrating, but I've just sat back and prayed to God that I'll get my chance 
one day." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Stokes' wrenched knee early on in training camp provided Robinson an 
immediate chance to impress. And now that he's on the right side, the side that 
suits his skills the best, he has the opportunity to change the opinions of his 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to complain," Robinson said. "People talk, and you can't say it 
doesn't bother you, but they don't know the whole story." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who was the 14th player selected in the 1986 draft, suffered a 
broken leg his rookie season in Minnesota. A year later he tore a knee 
ligament, which required him to spend an additional year recuperating on 
injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 His first three years in the game were a waste, and after being dumped by 
Minnesota, he was confined to injured reserve and then the bench in San Diego. 
Misfortune might have driven him from the game had he not been supported by his 
own fan club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the baby of 12 kids," Robinson said. "I can call somebody at any time of 
the day and hear a friendly voice. That's important to me; we're a very close 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be truthful, the reason I stayed with this game when everything was so 
tough was to take care of my mom. My mom had 12 kids and nothing else in life, 
and so those days when I thought about quitting, I thought about my mom and 
worked harder. I wanted her to have the best things in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's father died when he was 14 and so his mother, Annie, became his 
biggest fan during high school and college. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't want me to play football in high school," he said. "I told her I 
was staying after school for band until one day someone told her, 'That son of 
yours is going to be a pretty good football player.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She was there for all my games, though, and when I got hurt, she wanted me to 
give football up. I was coming off injured reserve and getting better and then 
she died. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I was going to quit. I made my decision. My mother and I were so 
close, she was gone and there was nothing to play for anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's brother, Willie, however, talked him out of it, and so he played on 
and eventually joined the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had lost a lot of drive with my mom's passing," he said. "Things were not 
going well and I had been treated like a piece of meat after being hurt in 
Minnesota. But I came here and George Dyer put his faith in me and that meant 
so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I'm playing, I just wish I could walk out of the stadium and see my 
mom. She only saw me play in one professional game in person, and if she was 
still here, I'd be flying her in here all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 And damn the stats and the critics, he said, there would be no doubt about how 
his mother felt about his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how you are to your mom," he said. "You're the best in the world."

HOLLYWOOD PARK BUYS PHOENIX'S TURF PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood Park announced Thursday that it has completed the acquisition of 
Turf Paradise, a thoroughbred racing facility in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park announced in February that it had signed a letter of intent to 
buy Turf Paradise in an all-stock transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the deal, Hollywood Park paid Turf Paradise shareholders 
about 1,498,000 shares of Hollywood Park common stock valued at about $33.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Turf Paradise acquisition meets our strategy of national expansion 
through racing and other gaming operations that offer excellent value and 
significant upside potential," said R.D. Hubbard, Hollywood Park chairman and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Hollywood Park acquired Woodlands, a greyhound and thoroughbred 
racing facility in Kansas City, Kan., and last month it opened the Hollywood 
Park Casino in Inglewood.

BULLFROGS, SALSA, SPLASH HOPE TO GAIN FANS FROM BASEBALL STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobby McKillop and Savo Mitrovic don't understand all of the issues behind the 
baseball players' strike. 
</P>
<P>
 But they know they'll have to find something else to occupy their spare time 
now that the major league baseball players' strike has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Players from the Bullfrogs of Roller Hockey International, the Salsa of the 
American Professional Soccer League, and the Splash of the Continental Indoor 
Soccer League, hope some fans will focus on something new. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hopeful those fans who used to go to Angel games might give indoor soccer 
a chance," said Dale Ervine, a forward with the Splash. "If they give us an 
opportunity, they'll come back. This is a great sport." 
</P>
<P>
 McKillop and Mitrovic, who are playing their second consecutive summer with 
the defending RHI champion Bullfrogs, have watched their sport flourish. The 
Bullfrogs' average paid attendance this season was 10,156 in 11 home dates. 
</P>
<P>
 When they weren't playing roller hockey, McKillop and Mitrovic enjoyed going 
to Anaheim Stadium to watch the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Blue Jays came to Anaheim, we got to meet some of the players," 
Mitrovic said. "I was ecstatic. I was like a little kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitrovic and McKillop share an enthusiasm for baseball, but both are also 
frustrated with the national pastime's current strife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players like Frank Thomas and Ken Griffey Jr. are having great seasons," 
McKillop said. "And I'd love to see Matt Williams take a shot at Roger Maris' 
single-season home-run record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball players are making umpteen-million dollars, but if they can generate 
those kinds of salaries, more power to them. I don't think this union situation 
is any different than the guy making $400 per week. You get what you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitrovic doesn't like the role that economics has played recently in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not playing hockey for the money, but because I love the game," Mitrovic 
said. "When it becomes a business and you lose that love, then it's time to get 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitrovic and McKillop, both 25, played last season with the Detroit Falcons of 
the Colonial League, one of the minor leagues in professional ice hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 RHI's season, which runs from June through August, provides supplementary 
summer income to those minor-league players with NHL dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 The average salary for an RHI player is $2,000 per month. The minimum salary 
is $1,300 per month and the maximum is $4,500 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Splash players on the lower end of the salary scale earn $1,500 per month. 
Last season, Salsa players' salaries ranged from $2,500 to $5,000 per month 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The average salary is $100,000 per month in major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're comparing two different worlds though," said Rod Castro, Splash 
forward. "Soccer is a minor sport here, and baseball . . . well, it's baseball. 
I just wish they would have went on strike earlier. Then, maybe more people 
would have been coming to see us." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Splash's first season at Anaheim, the team has averaged 4,213 fans in 
11 home dates. The Salsa has averaged more than 2,300 in three home games this 
season after averaging 5,487 in 12 home dates last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels averaged 24,009 fans in 63 home games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine, who helped the Salsa advance to the APSL championship game last 
season, knows the strike ultimately will hurt baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see the type of money that's being thrown around is mind-boggling," Ervine 
said. "But if the players don't give in to the salary cap, salaries will 
escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners aren't asking the players to play for peanuts, since players could 
still make $5-6 million per year. If there is no cap, ultimately someone will 
be responsible for pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be passed on to Joe and Bob, who take their families to the games. 
The whole thing doesn't make a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitrovic found his own silver lining: "As long as the (Blue) Jays are 17 games 
out, they can go out on strike."

WOMEN'S TOUR REMAINS A CHISHOLM TRAIL; BEACH VOLLEYBALL: AT 36 SHE MAINTAINS A 
STRICT TRAINING REGIMEN THAT HELPS KEEP HER AMONG THE TOP MONEY-WINNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At an age when many other professional athletes are thinking about life after 
sports, Linda Chisholm, the 36-year-old pro beach volleyball player from Van 
Nuys, does not think beyond her next match. 
</P>
<P>
 Her focus dims when she talks about life after volleyball -- it seems like a 
lifetime away. But it sharpens again when the conversation turns to her next 
opponent, whomever that may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Chisholm's concentration is undeniably present, and so is her success. She and 
her partner, Linda Hanley, finally won two tournaments after four second-place 
finishes earlier this season on the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals women's 
tour. They will go for their third victory when the Seal Beach Open begins 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing can change Chisholm's age. And the toll that age has taken on her body 
has been unavoidable as well. But Chisholm has remained among the sport's elite 
with a tireless work ethic and a veteran's savvy from eight years of 
professional experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have people around you saying, 'God, you played great, even though you're 
36 years old,' " she said. "I'm like, 'Oh, thanks. You're not supposed to know 
that part.' " 
</P>
<P>
 How Chisholm has remained in peak physical condition is no secret -- through 
hard practices and a disciplined workout regimen. 
</P>
<P>
 Where she does it is somewhat of a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Chisholm and Hanley practice at a pair of volleyball courts that are tucked 
snugly between a deserted beachfront club and a small cafe that overlooks the 
Pacific Ocean. Joggers, bicyclists and even pigeons pass the little nook and 
pay little attention to Chisholm, who stretches on the sand, away from the 
noontime beach traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Many pros practice several miles north at the courts clustered on Will Rogers 
State Beach. But she likes this place, just out of sight of Pacific Coast 
Highway. All of the championships and prize money can only come if she's out 
there, jumping and hustling for two hours. Then she follows up by sweating some 
more lifting weights at a local gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not a young player anymore," said Dane Selznick, Chisholm and Hanley's 
coach. "Even her partner, who's a mother, can't get out there as much as Linda 
Chisholm can. She's always wanting to work out with me any chance she gets." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone on the tour, however, is a good athlete -- the weekend warriors and 
less-dedicated players were weeded out long ago. Chisholm's edge is her 
experience after two seasons in the AVP and six seasons in the Women's 
Professional Volleyball Assn., another pro beach volleyball league. 
</P>
<P>
 She held the No. 1 ranking on the WPVA tour in 1987 and 1988. Her $219,147 in 
career earnings is No. 1 among AVP women, and her 33 career victories is 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a veteran and she's in great shape," Hanley said. "If she makes sure 
the physical part of her game is there, then we're fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Chisholm teamed with Holly McPeak for three tournaments in 1993, and the pair 
won the Chicago Open. McPeak is No. 3 on the AVP women's tour with $22,279 in 
prize money this season. "She's very difficult to read and that comes with 
playing for a long time," McPeak said. "She's got a lot of range on her 
offense, so she's pretty difficult to play against." 
</P>
<P>
 Chisholm's court demeanor is equally unflappable, even when a ball slips 
through her block or when a serve lands out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very even keel," Hanley said. "In the middle of the game she might be 
having some trouble, things might not be going her way, but I know that I won't 
lose her." 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the season, it looked like Chisholm and Hanley would never 
be able to get past second place. They were runners-up four times, and finished 
third once and fourth twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like we had a jinx," Chisholm said. "Can we ever get past second 
place? Can we go out and win a tournament?" 
</P>
<P>
 The doubt continued until Chisholm and Hanley finally won two consecutive 
events in the middle of the season in late June and early July -- the Baltimore 
Open and the Manhattan Beach Open. 
</P>
<P>
 But three weeks separated Manhattan Beach from the next AVP event, the Chicago 
Open, where Chisholm and Hanley finished a disappointing fourth. At the New 
Jersey Open, which followed Chicago, they placed fifth, their worst performance 
of the season. They blamed the long hiatus preceding Chicago for their poor 
recent showings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really wanted to start playing because you were on a roll," Chisholm 
said. "You wanted to continue that feeling. In three weeks you kind of lose 
that a little bit. We couldn't conjure up enough energy to get going again." 
</P>
<P>
 After Seal Beach, there are only two more tour events -- the San Diego Open 
and Hermosa Beach Open. Chisholm and Hanley hope they can finish in midseason 
fashion -- with a pair of victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Chisholm only started playing volleyball as a senior at Birmingham High before 
going on to College of the Canyons (1975-77) and Pepperdine (1977-81). 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer before her junior year at Pepperdine, she was introduced to 
beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really preferred playing on the beach than indoors," Chisholm said. "The 
surface is a lot easier to play on and you don't get sore. And it was a more 
individualized sport, two-versus-two rather than six-versus-six." 
</P>
<P>
 Back then it was just a hobby, a far cry from the career she has managed to 
shape out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a job, it's how I earn a living," she said. "How much money you make 
depends on your success. You really have to try to win the tournaments in order 
to make a living at it. And it's stressful. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think of exercise not being stressful, but it is because you want to 
win."

BRADSHAW WON'T CHANGE STYLE; BASKETBALL: SUSPENSION THAT FOLLOWED SHOVING 
INCIDENT HAS NOT MELLOWED SIMI VALLEY COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Although Simi Valley High basketball Coach Dean Bradshaw intends to put his 
past behind him, he can't guarantee that it won't sneak up on him in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw, who shoved senior guard Sam Rodriguez to the floor during an 
on-court altercation at a game in January and was subsequently suspended by 
school officials for the final nine games of the season, is a taskmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees nothing wrong with his style of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone said, 'Dean, you have to change, or you have to bring down a level 
of your intensity, your competitiveness,' I would not coach," Bradshaw said. "I 
mean, you gotta be yourself. We all have our own different personalities and I 
think we get comfortable with those personalities. If I had to change that, I 
couldn't be as successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw is happy to be back coaching at Simi Valley. He has guided the 
Pioneers to a 17-5 record in summer leagues and is preparing for his seventh 
season as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season was not the first time Bradshaw's aggressive court behavior 
resulted in a suspension. He sat out one game in 1991 after a verbal 
altercation with game officials following a 65-62 overtime loss to Camarillo. 
Bradshaw allegedly followed the officials to their dressing quarters at the 
conclusion of the game at Simi Valley and had to be restrained by Jack Harris, 
a teacher at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, Bradshaw found himself under scrutiny again. Although 
Bradshaw regrets his actions toward Rodriguez, he is ambivalent regarding the 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was just a burst from the player and a burst from the coach," he 
said. "It was obviously a very unfortunate situation for our program, for the 
actual player and for the coach. It was a reaction and it's nothing (I'm) real 
proud of, by any means. But there's nothing you can do about it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Rodriguez and his parents don't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who stayed with the team after the incident, is still receiving 
threats from callers who blame him for Bradshaw's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Rodriguez Sr. said his son has suffered enough backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got caught up in all the press in the beginning and I don't think it helped 
the situation," Rodriguez said. "We still get comments, that's why I don't want 
to fan the flames anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Gonzalez, Rodriguez' attorney, has filed a claim with the Simi Valley 
Unified School District asking for $1 million in damages for Rodriguez. The 
action is the first step toward bringing a lawsuit against Bradshaw and the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have been happy to forget about it, but Sam has been continuously 
bombarded by teachers, former players and coaches with the stigma of having 
caused Bradshaw's suspension," Gonzalez said. "There is no doubt that Bradshaw 
conducted himself in an inappropriate way, and he is blaming his inappropriate 
actions on a student-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have adults in positions of responsibility over our youths who can't 
control their anger." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez and Bradshaw have had no contact since the incident. Bradshaw made a 
public apology several days later, but has made no attempt to speak with 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 And if he had the opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say what I've been saying all along, that I regret the situation and 
I think we both made mistakes and that not any one mistake is any greater than 
the other. Can we accept that we both made a mistake? I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bradshaw did not fight the suspension, he wishes the situation was 
handled differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a firm believer that you handle your problems from within your team, and 
we really were not given that opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw will start the 1994-95 season with only one returning player.  
</P>
<P>
 The coach has not discussed the incident with the new players, nor does he 
plan to. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've turned the page and we're going to go on and continue to be 
successful," he said.

BASKETBALL TEAM NEEDS A HOME IN SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the Simi Valley High gymnasium deemed structurally unsafe since the 
earthquake, and unavailable for at least the 1994-95 basketball season, the 
Pioneers are left to scramble for a place they can call home -- at least 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simi Valley administrators are lobbying for funds to build a 
temporary gym on campus, a need remains for a practice facility for the months 
in which it will take to build the structure. Estimates project at least 90 
days to build a temporary gym and the final proposal for the structure will not 
be submitted until the end of August. A decision regarding that proposal is 
expected to take several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But, those working on the project remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to have it done before the basketball season," said Lowell 
Schultze, a Simi Valley Unified School District employee who is coordinating 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the proposal, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will pick 
up 90% of the cost, the state 7.5% and the district the remaining 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials are currently considering three different types of 
structures and two possible sites on campus. The three structures currently 
being considered include a fabric, tent-like dome with PVC framing, a permanent 
steel structure, or an air dome -- much like the "bubble" gym already erected 
at Alemany High. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for the Simi Valley structure to be nearly twice the size 
of Alemany's, which includes one regulation basketball court and seating to 
accommodate about 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's proposed gym would be nearly as large as its permanent gym and 
would seat 700 to 800. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball Coach Dean Bradshaw is hoping the Pioneers' misfortune can be 
turned into a positive. He is hoping a "bubble" gym will throw off opposing 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will definitely use it to our advantage. We'll get to practice in the 
facility every day," Bradshaw said. "Other teams will only get to play in there 
once." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Pioneers are without an indoor practice facility -- but not 
without an option. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Parks and Recreation Dept. in June dedicated to the public a 
new $3.1 million gymnasium at Rancho Santa Susana Community Park, which is 
about half a mile from the school. Plans are currently being worked out that 
would allow the volleyball and basketball teams to practice in the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But, once again, proposals must be approved and decisions must be made, which 
means school will have started long before plans are finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the discussion stage with Simi Valley Unified," said Rick 
Johnson, public information director for parks and recreation. "But the parks 
and Simi Valley Unified have shared their facilities for a long time -- 33 
years of a good working relationship -- so I don't foresee a problem."

SYLMAR ADMITS TO BREAKING THE RULES; FOOTBALL: SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR CONFIRMS 
SOME SPARTANS PRACTICED AGAINST PLAYERS FROM PIERCE COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Sylmar High administrator on Thursday admitted to the City Section that the 
school's football team committed rules violations this week by participating in 
a practice against players from Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 City Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege said the infractions will be reviewed 
by the Rules Committee during its first meeting of the year Sept. 14. The 
season opener is Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar receivers and backs participated against Pierce in a non-contact 
exercise similar to a passing-league competition Tuesday. Sylmar Coach Jeff 
Engilman admitted that the practice took place, but said he was unaware that 
any violations were committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said Sylmar, which won the 1992 City 4-A Division title and usually 
ranks among the area's most-successful programs, broke two rules: 
</P>
<P>
 * The City's off-season ended Aug. 1, with the beginning of the conditioning 
period. During conditioning, teams are permitted to hold only non-contact 
intrasquad workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sylmar committed a violation by practicing against a team with players whose 
ages excened the limit for California Interscholastic Federation eligibility. 
Also, interaction with college players is specifically forbidden in the City, 
Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege reiterated that it is the coach's responsibility to understand the 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ignorance hasn't gotten anybody anywhere around here," she said tersely. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Wyatt, an assistant principal at Sylmar, referred calls regarding the 
violations to Principal Linda Ambro. Wyatt met with Engilman Thursday morning 
to discuss the incident and admitted the violations to Fiege. Ambro did not 
return phone calls and Engilman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege would not predict what sanctions Sylmar could face, but said they may 
not be as severe as first believed. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of disciplinary measures levied against Sylmar last season for 
holding an improper team meeting revealed that the team's probationary period 
was not for one year, as Fiege initially believed, but for the 1993 season 
only. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar administrators pointed out the oversight Thursday. Fiege was under the 
impression that the team was placed on notice for 12 months, the typical 
probationary period for City rules violations. Taft's football team, for 
example, is serving one calendar year of probation for committing a violation 
for undue influence on a prospect earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me a while to figure that out," Fiege said. "(But) I'm not saying the 
penalties are going to be any less or any more." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Engilman is currently serving probation of an indeterminate length 
imposed by Sylmar officials, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marks the second time in less than a year that Sylmar has been 
called on the carpet by the City. Last Labor Day weekend, a Sylmar team meeting 
held during a dead period was videotaped by an assistant coach from a rival 
school. Engilman said he believed the team was prohibited only from practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach maintained that the meeting was held to distribute uniforms, though 
Sylmar players were filmed lifting weights. In addition to probation, Sylmar 
was ordered to forgo two practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, at least two Sylmar football players were arrested during an 
on-campus drug sweep by the Los Angeles Police Department, which had conducted 
a lengthy undercover operation at the school.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: BODINE FEUD IS THE HOTTEST BUT NOT FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bodine brothers of Chemung, N.Y., seem to be involved in a stock car 
racing version of "Family Feud," but as far as NASCAR is concerned, it's a 
private matter, and the car bashing and trash talking between Geoff and Brett 
last Saturday at the Brickyard 400 wasn't enough to warrant a suspension, fine 
or even reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a long look at the incident itself, and it appeared to be just what 
Brett Bodine said it was, just a racing incident," said Kevin Triplett, NASCAR 
spokesman, from Daytona Beach, Fla., headquarters. "If it hadn't been brothers, 
or Geoff hadn't brought the bad feeling up on TV, it would have pretty much 
gone unnoticed." 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers, both driving Ford Thunderbirds, were battling for the lead 
midway through stock car racing's first race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway 
when Geoff tapped Brett in the rear before passing him. Once Geoff got in 
front, Brett tapped him back, causing Geoff to lose control and go into a wild 
spin. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident knocked Geoff Bodine and Dale Jarrett out of the race and Brett 
Bodine went on to finish second behind Jeff Gordon, his highest finish of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like one of any number of Winston Cup fender-bender accidents until 
Geoff said on television: "He spun me out. We've been having family problems, 
and he took it out on the race track. I never expected him to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett denied that he had done it maliciously, but did acknowledge publicly the 
family feud with his brother -- something well known among NASCAR regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither brother would say what started it, there were many stories. 
One source said that it stemmed from a joint souvenir business venture in which 
Brett, who drives for Kenny Bernstein, believed that Geoff was skimming profits 
to help finance his racing team. 
</P>
<P>
 There also has been talk that one of the brothers thought the other wasn't as 
concerned as he should have been when their mother had a heart attack last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another rumor was that Brett, who is leaving Bernstein's team after this 
season, asked Geoff for help in starting his own team and Geoff implied that he 
didn't think Brett could handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's just big brother being contested by little brother," Brett said. 
"We were never competitive until we started racing against each other. He's 10 
years older than me, for God's sake." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff is 45, Brett 35, and Todd, the other racing Bodine, is 29.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, the feud had erupted before, and the older brothers 
acknowledged that they had not spoken for three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
 At Talladega, Ala., during practice for the May 1 Winston Select 500, the two 
got into a shouting match that could be heard over the roar of engines. Last 
month, after Geoff had won the Miller 500 at Pocono, Brett commented, "If I 
couldn't win a race on tires like he had, I'd pack up and go home." 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought the comment referred to the Hoosier-Goodyear tire war -- Geoff 
was on Hoosiers, Brett on Goodyears -- but those close to the situation said it 
was Brett's way of denigrating his brother's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have any brothers?" Geoff asked plaintively when he spoke later about 
the Indy incident. "Family things are tough to deal with sometimes. I shouldn't 
have mentioned it, but I did. I guess we'll get it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Geoff did not back down from his original statement. Asked if he cared 
to reconsider his accusation about being spun out, he said: "I don't say things 
I don't mean. It was said once, and that's enough." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not Brett Bodine's first bumping incident this year. He was penalized 
five laps for banging into Morgan Shepherd in a race at Dover, Del. 
</P>
<P>
 And feuds carried out on the track are nothing new. Bobby Allison and Richard 
Petty were rubbing on one another so much in the 1970s that both were 
reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Bodine and Dale Earnhardt feuded in the 1980s. Earnhardt, a hard-nosed 
North Carolinian, took exception to the Yankee intruder from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Derrike Cope and Ted Musgrave had words after on-track 
incidents, and Jimmy Spencer was fined $5,000 for ramming Ken Schrader during a 
race at North Wilkesboro, N.C. That incident was similar to the Bodine 
brothers' in that Schrader first ran into Spencer, then Spencer retaliated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bodines will be back on the track together Sunday at Watkins Glen, N.Y., 
but before that, there will be a family reunion Saturday night, planned long 
ago to celebrate their parents' anniversary, at the family home in Chemung. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait," Todd said. "Mom's the boss in the family. I wouldn't want to 
be Brett or Geoff."

THE USUAL PAIR EXPECTED TO WIN THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY; VOLLEYBALL: KIRALY AND 
STEFFES, WHO HAVE WON 13 OF 19 TOURNAMENTS THIS YEAR, ARE FAVORITES IN SEAL 
BEACH OPEN THAT STARTS TODAY.

<P>
 When the $100,000 Miller Lite Open beach volleyball tournament begins here 
today, there won't be any doubt which team is favored. 
</P>
<P>
 Karch Kiraly and Kent Steffes have won 13 of 19 tournaments this year and 50 
of their last 61. However, they have never teamed to win this event. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 48 men's teams and eight women's teams will compete in the 
three-day event, which will feature the world's top professional beach 
volleyball players, including Randy Stoklos, Adam Johnson, Mike Dodd, Mike 
Whitmarsh, Tim Hovland, Nancy Reno, Angela Rock, Cammy Ciarelli and Holly 
McPeak. 
</P>
<P>
 Play will run from 9:30 a.m to 5 p.m. today, 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday and 
9 a.m. to about 1 p.m. Sunday, with the men's championship match scheduled for 
11:30 a.m. The women's final will be earlier, probably around 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize money for the men includes $20,000 for the first-place team; the 
women will play for $20,000, including $5,714 for the champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The matches will be played next to the Seal Beach Pier, at Eighth Street and 
Ocean Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 At last year's tournament, Kiraly and Steffes made it to the championship 
match but lost a grueling final to tour veterans Dodd and Whitmarsh. 
</P>
<P>
 On the women's side, Ciarelli and McPeak will be trying to defend their title. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly and Steffes, who played for UCLA, won 11 of the first 13 tournaments 
this season before Kiraly was sidelined for several weeks because of a bruised 
kidney suffered June 11 during a tour stop in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair bounced back July 24 and won the championship match in Chicago and 
followed that with a victory last weekend in Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly is third among active players in tournament victories with 92; Steffes 
is fourth with 67. Sinjin Smith, who will not participate because of lingering 
knee problems, leads all active players with 135 victories. Stoklos, the former 
longtime partner of Smith, has won 120 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth consecutive year, the Miller Brewing Company will award 
$750,000 in bonus pool money for season-long point leaders on the AVP tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonuses, which will be awarded during the Hermosa Beach tournament in two 
weeks, include $100,000 for the point leader. The remainder will be shared 
among the rest of the top 48 players. 
</P>
<P>
 Each player receives 10.5 points for first place. Steffes currently holds a 
6.25-point advantage over Kiraly because Steffes earned points when he teamed 
with Scott Ayakatubby in Puerto Rico while Kiraly was sidelined with the kidney 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd and Whitmarsh are third in the standings and trail Kiraly by 40 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Taylor, a Rio Mesa High graduate and a former baseball coach at Oxnard 
College, was named coach at University of Wyoming on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, an assistant at Wyoming last spring, replaces Jim Gattis, another 
coach with area ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Gattis, 41, played at North Hollywood High. He was named Western Athletic 
Conference East Division coach of the year last spring, leading the team to a 
32-23 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, 30, most recently coached in the area as an assistant at Simi Valley 
High in 1993. Gattis resigned to pursue business opportunities, which include a 
chain of family-owned coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about the opportunity, but sorry Jim had to leave," Taylor said. 
"He did a good job bringing the program up a notch." STEVE ELLING

PROGRAM KEEPING CITY KIDS' HOPES ALIVE; YOUTH BASEBALL: ANAHEIM STADIUM PLAYS 
HOST TO CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES OF THE RBI WORLD SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Young took in the scene Thursday at Anaheim Stadium, where survivors from 
a 16-team tournament were playing a championship game on a perfectly manicured 
field with umpires at each base, a public address announcer bellowing from 
above, an electronic scoreboard flashing in right field and ushers in the 
bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think, only 11 players showed up for Young's first RBI (Reviving 
Baseball in the Inner-City) program tryout in South Central Los Angeles five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see a World Series with all these cities and kids involved is so 
gratifying," said Young, a Florida Marlin scout who lives in Irvine. "I 
remember the first year I was just trying to get Major League Baseball to buy 
into this idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Major League Baseball did, providing financial support for Young's venture. So 
did the Sporting Goods Manufacturing Assn., which provides RBI programs with 
grants for the purchase of new equipment. Individual teams, such as the 
Dodgers, Angels and St. Louis Cardinals, got involved. 
</P>
<P>
 And what started as a local program for kids in South Central Los Angeles has 
grown to a nationwide effort, with 10,000 players from 40 cities and a 
season-ending World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 320 players from 10 U.S. cities, the Czech Republic and Puerto Rico were 
in Orange County this week for the RBI World Series, which ended with 
Thursday's championship games in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 While major league players were gearing up for a strike, Puerto Rico was busy 
beating Los Angeles, 5-0, for the junior division (age 13-15) title, after 
which players celebrated by spraying shaving cream at each other. Puerto Rico, 
whose RBI program was launched by Roberto Clemente Jr., also won the senior 
division (age 16-17) title, defeating Atlanta, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony is that 10 years ago most of the guys going on strike (today) were 
at this level," Young said. "You see both ends of the spectrum. There are so 
many kids out here enjoying the game, and the level they want to get to is 
having all these business problems. It makes no sense at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary games in the RBI tournament were played Sunday through Wednesday 
at Cal State Fullerton, Fullerton College, El Dorado High School in Placentia 
and Hart Park in Orange. National League President Leonard Coleman attended 
several games, and Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann and pitcher Joe Grahe helped 
conduct a clinic Tuesday, but players got a real taste of the big leagues -- 
minus labor disputes -- on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the parks we play at don't even have pitching mounds," said Barry 
Thomas, coach of the Los Angeles team. "Most kids never get a chance to play in 
a place like this. It means a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Avante Rose, Los Angeles' 15-year-old third baseman: "This was a dream 
come true. I'll always remember hearing my name called out on the 
public-address system." 
</P>
<P>
 If not for Young, who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, played baseball at 
Chapman College and spent nine years in the minor leagues, Rose and his 
teammates might have never experienced Thursday's thrills. 
</P>
<P>
 Noticing a decline in the number of skilled baseball players coming out of Los 
Angeles during the early 1980s, Young visited urban schools to find out why so 
many seem to quit playing baseball in their early teens. 
</P>
<P>
 There were the expected culprits -- a lack of organization in local leagues, 
poor funding, poor playing fields, the lure of street gangs. But Young also 
noticed an attitude shift among youngsters, who seemed to idolize basketball 
stars such as Michael Jordan a lot more than baseball stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids thought baseball was boring, and many were surprised that 
baseball scholarships were even available," Young said. "What happened was 
everyone wanted to be like Mike. When I grew up, I looked up to Willie Mays, 
Willie McCovey, Hank Aaron. Every team had a superstar African-American 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 Young launched his program to revive baseball in South Central Los Angeles in 
1989 and, despite the small initial turnout, he secured 180 players that first 
year. RBI expanded to St. Louis in 1990 and Kansas City and New York in 1992. 
Numerous cities were added in 1993, and the first RBI World Series was held 
last summer at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, with the help of a grant from the Autry Foundation, also incorporated 
an educational component in the Los Angeles program, with players receiving 
individual tutoring and Scholastic Aptitude Test preparation courses at Santa 
Monica College. Many players have gone on to play in college or the minor 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sold it to Major League Baseball as a scouting program to get everyone 
involved," said Darrell Miller, the Angels' special assignment scout and RBI 
tournament director. "But it's really an education program. Our goal is to get 
blacks and Latinos into college and get them educated so they grow up to be 
good people." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Thomas Jr., a 15-year-old second baseman and son of the Los Angeles 
coach, cringes when he thinks about what he'd be doing if he wasn't playing 
baseball all summer. His team plays three days a week and practices on three 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends in gangs try to get you to do crazy stuff, and if it wasn't for this 
I'd be getting into trouble," he said. "This helps keep me off the street and 
away from gang-banging. It also builds my confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Said the elder Thomas, who works for the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation 
Dept. and lives in South Central: "We have gangs and drugs, so the main thing 
is to keep them interested in baseball. We have to give them something to look 
forward to, because some of these guys have the potential to be someone."

NORTHRIDGE LITTLE LEAGUE ALL-STARS MAY BE ON VERGE OF SOMETHING BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They never want to stop playing. Maybe that's their secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they must stop, as they did grudgingly Thursday morning after 
spending two hours scrimmaging under a scorching sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Little League all-star team was to leave for San Bernardino and 
the Western Regional tournament in two hours. The players had to get home, grab 
some lunch and return to the field with their suitcases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd scrimmage all day, heck yeah," said Spencer Gordon, the team's right 
fielder, as his mother urged him to climb into her car. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge begins play against Anchorage, Alaska, today at 5 p.m in the 
eight-day, 14-team Western Regional, which includes one team from each of 12 
states plus two from California.  
</P>
<P>
 Stop playing? The Northridge players vow they won't stop until they win the 
Little League World Series championship in Williamsport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take a lot of baseball to get there, but, of course, playing the game 
is what these 11- and 12-year-olds do best. Northridge, the Southern California 
champion, has won 12 games in a row in capturing district, section and division 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Those suitcases had better be packed with more than dreams. Should the team 
make it to the World Series final Aug. 27, the players will have been away from 
home for more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Bernardino the players and coaches will stay in barracks. Manager Larry 
Baca and Coach George Saul might have an advantage over adults supervising some 
of the other teams: They are veterans of the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the parents joked that Larry and George can teach the kids how to 
make their beds and pick up after themselves," said Paula Mort, a Northridge 
Little League official. A Little Way 
</P>
<P>
 * Who: Northridge Little League 12-year-old all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Western Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Today at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Western Regional headquarters, 6707 Little League Drive, San 
Bernardino. Take Highway 118 east to Interstate 210 east to Interstate 10 east 
to Interstate 15 north to Interstate 215 east. Exit at Palm Avenue and turn 
north. Turn left at Little League Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tickets: Admission is free.

ARMY WILL BE MAIN USER AT PRESIDIO'S DEBUT AS PARK; LAND USE: LACK OF FUNDS 
STALLS PLAN FOR ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL CENTER. MILITARY WILL STILL CONTROL MUCH 
OF SITE OCT. 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past two years, national park planners have proclaimed that the 
historic Presidio will be a "national park unlike any other." 
</P>
<P>
 Their prediction is coming true, but not the way they envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 When the National Park Service officially takes over the scenic Army post Oct. 
1, the Presidio will be the only national park occupied primarily by the U.S. 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
 With a force of 380 uniformed personnel, the Army will control nearly 300 
buildings in the park as well as the Presidio's moneymaking golf course, the 
commissary, the post exchange, the gymnasium, the swimming pool and other 
recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials, still awaiting congressional authorization to renovate 
Presidio buildings for lease to nonprofit groups, said they had little choice 
but to sign up the Army as the park's main tenant. And, unless Congress acts 
soon, they say, they will be forced to board up many of the new park's 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else are we going to do with the buildings?" asked one frustrated 
Department of the Interior official, who helps oversee the park service. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service is caught in the middle of a clash over how best to 
use the Presidio -- 1,480 acres of historic buildings, rare vegetation and 
breathtaking vistas of San Francisco Bay, the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate 
Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of tight federal budgets, many members of Congress are in no mood to 
spend money on what would be the nation's most expensive national park. Some 
Republican congressmen have pushed to sell off part of the valuable property to 
private developers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Defense Department, which originally planned to vacate the site 
entirely, has reversed course. In addition to maintaining the 6th Army 
headquarters and military housing in the park, the Army has insisted on keeping 
control of the Presidio golf course -- and the $700,000 a year that it pumps 
into the Army's recreation and welfare fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "One has to question why the Army needs $700,000 of revenue a year to support 
380 uniformed personnel," said Michael Alexander of the Sierra Club. "We're 
talking about the place where lieutenant colonels and three-star generals come 
to do their last tour of duty before they retire. How much welfare do they 
need?" 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service's master plan calls for the transformation of the 
military post into a global center to address environmental, social and 
cultural issues. About 6.3 million square feet of space would be converted into 
conference centers, tourist facilities and offices for nonprofit organizations, 
including the Gorbachev Foundation. Visitors would not be charged an entrance 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan has always hinged on congressional approval of a bill by Rep. 
Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) allowing the park service to set up a management 
company -- the Presidio Trust -- to handle the leasing operation and reinvest 
revenues in the Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
 A key provision of the bill would have allowed the park to borrow up to $350 
million without regard to a federal spending cap to restore buildings in the 
park and convert them to civilian use. But Republican foes recently won 
approval of an amendment limiting the funds for renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelosi said she will seek to remove the funding restrictions once the bill 
reaches the Senate. But with less than eight weeks to go before the post 
officially becomes a park, the measure is still awaiting passage in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have no bill, we will still have a beautiful park," Pelosi said. "The 
option is not to sell it off. The option is to move much more slowly, to board 
up buildings. That's the worst-case scenario." 
</P>
<P>
 The Army, meanwhile, has been negotiating with the park service for months 
over what park property it would retain. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the two agencies announced an agreement giving the Army 
control over many of the park's prime assets -- including 1.8 million square 
feet of building space for the next five to seven years. This includes 600 of 
the post's 1,200 housing units, as well as office and recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, in turn, will get a guaranteed tenant that will pay $13 million a 
year -- a third of the park's operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Chandler, general manager of the Presidio park, said the agreement will 
not slow conversion because the Army will occupy buildings that are not 
essential to the park in its first few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the Army's presence, he said, the park service would not have 
been able to convert most of these buildings to park use in the next five to 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not giving up anything," Chandler said. "We think overall it's a good 
deal for the Army, a good deal for us and a good deal for the taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Army, maintaining control of the golf course for at least the next 
five years was a crucial part of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The $700,000 in income from the course will pay for all of the recreational 
facilities available to soldiers and officers on the post. Under the deal, 
civilians will be allowed to tee off, with a goal of 50% public play in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers deserve the recreational opportunities the money will provide because 
they sacrifice their freedom to join the Army, Maj. Wanda Arceneaux, a 6th Army 
spokeswoman, said. "When we join the military, we expect certain facilities to 
be available. That's part of the military benefits. We give up a lot of other 
things so we can have those benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement gives park service employees some special benefits too: While 
the general public will be barred from the gymnasium and swimming pool on the 
park grounds, park service employees will be able to join the soldiers in 
working out or going for a dip. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler defended the arrangement, saying all park tenants and federal 
employees will be able to use the gym and pool. "It's part of the sense of 
community that has existed on the Presidio for a long time," he said. Plans for 
Presidio 
</P>
<P>
 When the historic Presidio becomes part of the national park system Oct. 1, 
the Army will become the park's largest tenant. The Army had originally planned 
to abandon the site. But under a new agreement the Army will lease 277 
buildings -- including the 6th Army headquarters, family housing and the 
commissary -- and the Presidio's scenic golf course.

STRICTER RULES ASKED FOR STEEL FRAME BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN and SONIA NAZARIO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alarmed by widespread cracking of steel frame buildings in the Northridge 
earthquake, the California Seismic Safety Commission took the unprecedented 
step Thursday of urging building officials throughout the western United States 
to suspend a construction code and require proof that new mid- to high-rise 
buildings can withstand major earthquakes.  
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous recommendation, already adopted in modified form by the city and 
county of Los Angeles, is expected to boost the cost of constructing office 
buildings, hospitals and other steel-frame structures, in some cases by 
millions of dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission said the change was necessary because some new steel structures 
continue to be built using the same methods that allowed steel frames to crack 
during the Northridge quake. Although the commission is an advisory body, 
members said they are optimistic that their recommendation will be followed by 
the International Conference of Building Officials and California's Building 
Standards Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission is taking a leadership role -- all the other entities have a 
vested interest in this," said Paul Fratessa, chairman of the Seismic Safety 
Commission. "It's very difficult for a (local) building department to charge 
ahead and change something that will cost (developers) money." 
</P>
<P>
 Steel frame buildings, designed to bend with enormous forces without breaking, 
were long considered among the safest to ride out an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these modern buildings came close to collapse in the Jan. 17 quake, 
engineers said. But cracks have been discovered in the welded connections of at 
least 110 buildings, more than a quarter of all steel frame buildings in 
quake-affected areas in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside. Up to 90% 
of the connections in some buildings cracked. Cracks were detected in buildings 
constructed since 1966; the tallest was 23 stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we saw from the Northridge earthquake were things we just didn't expect. 
We are all in a quandary," Arthur E. Ross, president of the Structural 
Engineers Assn. of California, testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the seismic commission urged building officials to set aside the old 
code governing the connections, the body said it would be unable to offer even 
interim construction alternatives until mid-September when a research 
consortium meets. It added that there is no consensus on how to prevent 
supporting beams and columns from snapping in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers and engineers will have to substantiate building designs on a 
case-by-case basis by providing "additional calculations, testing, improvements 
in design, inspection and construction practices."  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles engineers must now try to satisfy safety concerns without 
clear-cut standards, and some building officials said the commission's 
recommendation will have a chilling effect on the construction of steel frame 
buildings while researchers continue their struggle to find a solution.  
</P>
<P>
 "Effectively, this puts (some) projects on hold," said Tom Kinsman, principal 
engineer for Seattle's department of construction and land use. "There are big 
liability issues for engineers if there are known questions about a design." 
</P>
<P>
 But engineers and steel industry officials agreed that the lessons of the 
Northridge quake could not be ignored and supported the seismic commission's 
recommendations. Some privately said they were relieved because they feared 
that the commission might push for a total ban on the construction of steel 
frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers acknowledged that some new buildings were being constructed using 
the old design, but they said the vast majority were incorporating strengthened 
connections.  
</P>
<P>
 "Any engineer practicing in a seismic zone has already mentally suspended this 
code section," said steel fabricator Roger Ferch, vice president of Herrick 
Corp., among the largest steel fabricators in the West.  
</P>
<P>
 Only one engineer formally opposed the suspension, calling it alarmist. "At 
this stage . . . there is no clear indication of why the joints failed," wrote 
Rick Ranous, a senior structural engineer with the state Office of Emergency 
Services, urging that the commission issue another warning about the problem 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials in several western cities, including Seattle, San Francisco 
and Reno, said they would probably change their requirements for steel frame 
buildings if the two groups petitioned by the seismic commission follow its 
recommendation.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of both groups said approval was likely. "I think they have to do it. 
I don't see how they can say no," said Fred Herman, an International Conference 
of Building Officials board member.  
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco and Seattle, building officials said they are more closely 
scrutinizing blueprints for steel frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles on Aug. 1 made a policy change requiring that 
engineers present proof on a case-by-case basis that connections in proposed 
steel-frame buildings have been sufficiently strengthened. The action is being 
felt, although the impact has been softened by the dearth of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, building officials are closely scrutinizing building 
plans and requiring similar evidence that connections are safe, but have not 
formally suspended the building code.  
</P>
<P>
 County building officials said they are requiring the firm constructing the 
Downtown Walt Disney Concert Hall -- which is being built to a standard far 
above code requirements -- to submit an additional written plan outlining how 
welding inspections will be conducted and the frequency of those checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers for the massive County-USC Medical Center, which includes a 15-story 
hospital and will replace existing facilities, say reinforcing the steel frames 
could tack on as much as $10 million to the $740-million tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding reinforcement plates to the connections in a 10-story, $44-million 
county courthouse that will be built next year near Los Angeles International 
Airport will probably cost an extra $500,000, engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts estimated that strengthening steel connections would generally 
increase construction costs about 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes a building harder to pencil out," said Los Angeles structural 
engineer Thomas Sabol. "It will be a big hurdle." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just another degree of uncertainty in a very tight market," said one 
steel fabricator. 
</P>
<P>
 Building owners in Los Angeles also expressed mounting frustration with the 
lack of definitive building regulations. "We're not in favor of government 
abdicating its role, and it appears to me . . . they're doing that," said 
Geoffrey Ely, spokesman for the Greater Los Angeles Building Owners and 
Managers Assn., which represents 30% of the area's commercial buildings. "We've 
got owners about to spend millions of dollars and there's no standard 
methodology yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin are showing more promising 
results than previously reported in their effort to develop welding methods and 
design changes that will reduce damage to steel frame buildings in earthquakes. 
Previous tests found that methods recommended by Los Angeles city officials to 
repair broken welds and beams failed when subjected to simulated magnitude 7.0 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a second round of tests has produced more positive results, professor 
Michael D. Engelhardt, a leading steel expert who is conducting the study for 
the American Institute of Steel Construction, cautioned that further research 
will be necessary to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A recently formed consortium of scientists, structural engineers and others in 
the steel industry is seeking government funding for an $18.5-million, 
three-year research project. With an initial grant of less than $2 million, the 
group hopes to come up with interim construction guidelines by the end of the 
year, a spokesman said.

HOUSE LEADERS DELAY ACTION ON HEALTH CARE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Democratic leaders announced Thursday night that their debate on health 
care legislation will not begin as scheduled next week -- a delay that casts 
additional doubt on whether Congress can enact sweeping health care legislation 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders declined to say when they might vote on a bill, although 
speculation was that it may not happen until next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know when the situation is going to be possible for us to consider 
health care," a grim-faced House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told 
reporters after a meeting Thursday night with White House officials and Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, it had become increasingly clear that the legislative 
process had disintegrated into something approaching chaos, with one undecided 
Democrat summing up the view of many in the House regarding the prospects for 
the health care bill: "It's in free-fall right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, House Democratic leaders blamed the delay on the impossibly heavy 
crush of work that has been thrust upon the Congressional Budget Office, whose 
staff of less than 20 has been asked to perform detailed economic analyses on a 
host of alternative proposals. The leadership gave no indication when those 
analyses would be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents suggested that the postponement really was a desperation ploy by 
leaders who know they lack the votes to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big problem is the CBO cost accounting of those bills," Foley insisted. 
"Any other explanation is a myth, total myth, absolutely false." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the explanation, many say they believe that the delay could be fatal 
to the legislation because it will give the bill's opponents the opportunity to 
mobilize as lawmakers return home to their districts for Congress' summer 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps us, because they are going to be out there talking to real people," 
said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 By now, both houses are months behind the schedule they had set for 
themselves. As time has passed, opposition to the concept of national health 
insurance has strengthened, support has eroded and the public appears to have 
lost much of its sense of urgency on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is the scarcest commodity we have right now," said Rep. Pete Stark 
(D-Hayward), chairman of the Ways and Means health subcommittee, whose bill is 
the foundation of the legislation that was offered by Majority Leader Richard 
A. Gephardt. "We have a deadline of Nov. 8 (Election Day). The opponents don't 
have any deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs now indicate that any legislation Congress might pass will be far less 
ambitious than the plan outlined last year by President Clinton, which would 
guarantee health coverage for all citizens. Indeed, even as the Democratic 
leaders were revamping their schedule, a bipartisan group of House members 
announced a proposal falling well short of the President's goal of universal 
coverage and avoiding the more controversial elements of the House leadership 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prospects for the legislation in the House grew more dicey, however, 
there were flickers of strength in the Senate, which was in the third day of 
debate on a health measure put forward by Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 In floor speeches, Sens. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) and Frank R. Lautenberg 
(D-N.J.) offered support for the Mitchell bill, although both said they wanted 
to change certain elements of it. Kohl and Lautenberg, both of whom are up for 
reelection this year, are among a small number of uncommitted Democrats -- 
fewer than a dozen -- who will determine whether Mitchell can get the 50 votes 
he needs to pass his legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview published Thursday by the New York Times, Clinton indicated 
that he would veto anything weaker than the Mitchell bill. That bill seeks to 
make the so-called employer mandate more palatable by making it a fallback and 
giving other incentives a chance to work first. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's requirement that most employers pay 50% of their workers' health 
premiums would become effective only if voluntary measures did not succeed in 
producing 95% coverage by the year 2000. It also would not apply to firms 
employing 25 people or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many House Democrats are reluctant to vote before they know the direction the 
Senate is headed. They fear that taking a politically risky stand in favor of 
the House bill's mandatory 80% employer mandate unless they can be confident 
that the Senate will at least support the watered-down mandate in the Mitchell 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a Senate vote on that issue has yet to be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 A House delay could provide maneuvering room for a bipartisan group of 
moderates -- five Republicans and five Democrats -- who Thursday formally 
unveiled their own proposal for incremental reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, their more modest bill has won the endorsements of three giant health 
care industry groups: doctors, hospitals and insurers. If Gephardt's bill were 
killed, the bipartisan bill -- which proposes far less sweeping reforms -- 
could become the political lifeboat for House members who do not want to go 
home empty-handed for the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill does not guarantee coverage to the 39 million uninsured Americans. 
Rather, it would rely on incremental reforms to break down barriers to 
insurance, such as banning discriminatory practices in order to enable 
consumers to take their insurance from job to job and to buy affordable 
policies even when family members have existing illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also would expand rural and community health centers and provide 
subsidies to needy individuals and families on a sliding scale, up to 240% of 
the poverty level for pregnant women and children under age 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidies would amount to $117 billion over five years and $340 billion 
over 10 years, most of which would come from savings in Medicare and Medicaid, 
according to those drafting the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the legislation, the sponsors spent as much time talking about 
what their bill does not contain as what it does. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rep. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.): "It does not rely on employer mandates, tax 
increases, price controls, new entitlements, rationing of care, limitations on 
choice or bureaucratic expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bill," added Rep. Michael Bilirakis (R-Fla.) "fixes the cracks in our 
system without tearing down the walls." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems the bill faces, however, is that it is projected to attain 
only about 90% coverage by the year 2004 -- a potential obstacle to gaining 
broader support. Currently, an estimated 85% of the U.S. population has health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is an amalgamation of two proposals introduced earlier: one by 
Rowland and Bilirakis, which had 74 sponsors (37 from each party) and the other 
by Reps. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Fred Grandy (R-Iowa), which had 57 
co-sponsors from the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
 In many key ways, the bipartisan bill resembles the proposal introduced 
earlier in the week in the Senate by Dole. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bipartisan bill was immediately endorsed Thursday by two powerful 
health care interest groups: the Federation of American Health Systems, which 
represents 1,440 investor-owned hospitals, and the Alliance for Managed 
Competition, made up of the nation's five largest insurers: Aetna, CIGNA, 
MetLife, Prudential and Travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful American Medical Assn. has also endorsed the plan. Among the 
provisions favored by the AMA is a cap of $250,000 on the amount any victim of 
medical malpractice may receive as compensation for non-economic damages. 
</P>
<P>
 As the new bill gained momentum, Gephardt continued to make modifications in 
his bill in hopes of picking up votes. Among them was the inclusion of a 
provision under which the government would subsidize health coverage for early 
retirees not yet covered by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 In another concession, Gephardt dropped a provision to require biotechnology 
companies to pay a 15% rebate to the government on biotech drugs covered under 
Medicare. He agreed to drop the provision largely at the behest of California 
Reps. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego) and Anna G. Eshoo (D-Atherton). 
</P>
<P>
 Stark said the majority leader also decided to include coverage for Christian 
Science treatment, to waive out-of-pocket costs for mammograms and other tests 
and to set a lower limit on the amount that individuals and families would pay 
for medical care in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark complained, however, that no provisions were being made to pay for those 
additions. "The leadership thus far has been unable to say no to anybody, 
except their friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior Democratic aide said that the prospects for the bill have become so 
bleak that such modifications are pointless: "God love Dick Gephardt, but he's 
doing organ transplants on a corpse."

NEWS ANALYSIS; 'BREAK GRIDLOCK' IMAGE SUFFERS DOUBLE BLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER and RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the history books are written, Thursday just may be recalled as the day 
President Clinton's luck -- and with it his effectiveness -- finally ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year-and-a-half, Clinton, despite being elected with only 43% 
of the vote, has managed to eke out of Congress a eries of one- and two-vote 
victories -- "Clinton landslides," his aides joked. Thursday, they stopped 
joking. 
</P>
<P>
 When the House rejected the $33-billion crime bill and its leaders informed 
the White House that they would have to delay floor debate on health care, the 
chief rationale for Clinton's presidency -- that he could "break gridlock" in 
Washington -- suffered two grievous blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Setbacks this large would damage any President. But for Clinton, who has held 
out "effectiveness" as the chief counter to Americans' widespread questions 
about his character, the damage is far worse. For him, a series of legislative 
defeats would leave him little ground to stand on. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, confident that the crime bill enjoys overwhelming 
public support, spoke defiantly about bringing the bill back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voting no is the wrong side to be on on this issue," said one White House 
strategist. Officials also insisted that, despite the scheduling setbacks, 
health care reform will prevail in the end. If either of those things happens, 
those major victories could erase much of this week's damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, anticipating large Democratic losses this fall, White House aides 
already had been laying plans for moving from a strategy based on legislative 
accomplishments to one based on more populist, more sharply toned, attacks on 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton previewed that strategy in an angry press conference after the crime 
bill vote -- vowing to fight on and denouncing opponents for bowing to "special 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked my heart out on it and I did everything I could. And on this day the 
(National Rifle Assn.) and the Republican leadership had their way," Clinton 
said. "I believe the American people will not like viewing this as some sort of 
political circus up here. I'm on their side and I think we better see who's on 
what side." 
</P>
<P>
 Some White House aides are hopeful that such an approach, less tied to 
negotiating endless compromises through Congress, could revive Clinton's 
standing with voters. In any case, Clinton has little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your platform is getting stuff done and you can't get anything done, you 
better find a new platform," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman.  
</P>
<P>
 But even if that shift in strategy should prove effective in the future, for 
now Clinton strategists made no attempt to hide their gloom. "This is very 
bad," said one. "It's beyond gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Clinton and his aides had held up the advancing crime bill as the 
symbol of his ability to break gridlock with "new Democrat" ideas that bridged 
the divides between liberals and conservatives. Because of that, the failure of 
this particular legislation suggests that the institutional, ideological and 
partisan roots of gridlock are even more difficult to reach than the President 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials were quick to blame the problem on Clinton's Republican 
opposition. But while the Republicans did run a fierce campaign against Clinton 
all year, they were not his main problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic vote counters had predicted that they could win if they got 10 
Republican votes; 11 Republicans sided with them and they lost. The reason was 
Democratic defections and the list of defectors illustrates Clinton's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The President did suffer some losses on the left, including Rep. Maxine Waters 
(D-Los Angeles) and nine other members of the 38-member Congressional Black 
Caucus. They said that they could not support the bill, despite its extensive 
new spending provisions for urban areas, because it contains several new death 
penalty provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton lost most heavily among his fellow Southerners and among 
conservatives, for whom alliance with Clinton has become a political millstone. 
The unwillingness of 58 members of his own party to link arms with Clinton on a 
major issue resembled nothing so much as the unraveling of the last Democrat to 
win the Oval Office, Jimmy Carter. And the fact that many congressional 
Democrats have dramatically and perhaps irrevocably severed their interests 
from Clinton's clearly cannot bode well for the health care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the individual defections show how Clinton's many problems have 
combined into a witch's brew of political trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 House Foreign Affairs Chairman Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), for example, is the 
sort of party loyalist whose vote a Democratic President ought to be able to 
count on in a pinch. But "he's so angry at the President on these other issues, 
we can't get him," a White House official said before the vote, referring to 
Hamilton's displeasure at Clinton's uneven leadership on Bosnia, Haiti and 
other foreign matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), is the sort of moderate, Southern "new 
Democrat" Clinton had hoped to build a coalition around. But he has been 
alienated from the White House on health care. He voted no. So, too, did Rep. 
Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), who followed Clinton as leader of the Democratic 
Leadership Council, the organization of moderate and conservative Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill's defeat was remarkable not only because the House leadership 
almost never loses on procedural votes but because the legislation was buoyed 
by two enormous tail winds. 
</P>
<P>
 One was intense public concern about crime -- in many states the top public 
concern. A recent Times Poll showed Americans supporting the bill 67% to 26% 
even after they were told about the large amounts of new spending that 
Republicans decried. The assault weapons ban had even wider support -- 71% to 
24%. 
</P>
<P>
 The second reason that many expected the bill to pass was the huge pot of 
money the legislation offered to interests all across the ideological and 
political spectrum: nearly $8 billion in social programs favored by liberals, 
almost $9 billion for mayors to hire police officers, $1.8 billion to states to 
help pay for the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants and $6.5 billion for 
prison construction, the top crime-fighting priority of conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the bill was strafed by ideological, partisan and special-interest 
cross-fires that testify to the extraordinary difficulty of breaking gridlock 
-- even on an issue of intense public concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the crime bill cleared the Senate on an overwhelming bipartisan vote last 
November, it quickly ran into ideological problems with House liberals, who 
considered the Senate measure too focused on punishment and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 To mollify House opposition, the Administration agreed to add billions of 
dollars in "prevention" programs and to strip out some of the most sweeping new 
penalties imposed in the Senate legislation, such as an effort to add gun 
crimes to the list of federal offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 But in what may have been a critical turn for the bill, House liberals went 
one step further -- inserting a provision that would allow prisoners on Death 
Row to challenge their sentences as racially biased. That measure held up the 
bill for weeks as the Administration labored without success to broker a 
compromise between House liberals who supported the so-called "racial justice" 
measure and the Senate, which adamantly opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 While those talks dragged on, the bill lost momentum, and the NRA launched a 
renewed offensive against its ban on 19 types of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Those efforts came amid an atmosphere of intensifying partisanship. As the 
bill came out of conference in late July, Republicans sharpened their 
denunciation of its social welfare spending -- even though the prevention 
spending in the final conference product differed only slightly from the House 
bill that 65 Republicans had voted for in April. 
</P>
<P>
 That intensely partisan atmosphere persisted right through Thursday's vote. At 
one point during the debate, for example, Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), the chair 
of the House Republican Conference, turned heads by staring at the Democrats 
and bitterly describing Clinton as "your President." 
</P>
<P>
 Some sympathetic observers also agreed that the Administration had given the 
Republicans ammunition through the compromises they made to minimize liberal 
discontent in the House. In addition to narrowly targeted prevention programs, 
such as drug treatment for prisoners, the bill also contained vast, loosely 
defined grant programs for cities and social welfare agencies -- including a 
$1.8-billion formula grant program that appeared closer to revenue sharing than 
to a crime-fighting measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill suffered from "congressional bloat," said Will Marshall, president of 
the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist think tank with ties to Clinton. 
"Bills up there grow like kudzu and become big leviathans that people are 
rightly skeptical of." 
</P>
<P>
 That the task of winning legislative victories in an undisciplined and 
polarized Congress is difficult was small consolation to Clinton Thursday 
night, however. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, overcoming major obstacles to deal with major problems is what 
being a successful President is all about.

REP. TUCKER IS INDICTED; DENIES BRIBERY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury Thursday returned a 10-count indictment against Rep. 
Walter R. Tucker III, charging him with soliciting and accepting $30,000 in 
bribes while serving as mayor of Compton and then failing to report the money 
on his federal income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, 37, issued a statement from his Washington office that proclaimed his 
innocence. "I unequivocally and categorically deny all charges that have been 
brought against me," the statement said. "I have complete faith in God, who is 
my shield and my defense. I will not allow this matter to impede the important 
work that I am doing in the U.S. Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 At a Los Angeles news conference where the indictments were announced, U.S. 
Atty. Nora M. Manella said that "while Congressman Tucker was acting as mayor 
of Compton in 1991 and 1992, over a period of a little more than a year, he 
accepted a total of $30,000 in bribes in connection with the construction and 
operation of a refuse incineration facility. The indictment further alleges 
that Mr. Tucker demanded a payment of a quarter-million dollars in exchange for 
his support of the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Manella and other federal officials declined to discuss details of the 
investigation that led to the indictment. But sources familiar with the case 
said it is the result of a two-year undercover probe run out of the FBI's Long 
Beach office that was sparked by a complaint from a local businessman who 
alleged that Compton officials were demanding bribes in return for approving 
his project. 
</P>
<P>
 That investigation is continuing, and authorities urged anyone with 
information about bribes being solicited in Compton to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting additional leads," said Steven G. Madison, the lead prosecutor 
in the case. "And we are pursuing them." 
</P>
<P>
 As the grand jury deliberated the counts against the Compton Democrat, Tucker 
continued to carry out his duties in Washington. Late Thursday, he cast a 
procedural vote in favor of President Clinton's crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who is representing Tucker, said his client 
"vigorously denies any wrongdoing. He's going to litigate this matter, and he's 
going to go to trial, no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to news of the indictment, some local leaders accused the Justice 
Department of targeting Tucker because he is black. Prosecutors denied the 
charge, saying they took action only after receiving the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Hobbs Act, the federal law that prohibits officials from taking or 
soliciting bribes, Tucker could be sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined 
$250,000 for each of the eight bribery counts. The tax charges each carry 
maximum penalties of three years in prison and a $100,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal sentencing guidelines recommend far shorter sentences, so even if 
Tucker is convicted, he would be unlikely to face those penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Manella, the tax counts against Tucker are partly the result of 
his failure to report income from the bribes on his 1991 and 1992 tax returns. 
But Manella added that the "underreported income includes but is not limited to 
bribes," suggesting that authorities believe that Tucker may have failed to 
report other income as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel today's indictment makes a strong statement that both fraud and greed 
are taxable," said Rick Speier, who heads the Criminal Investigation Division 
of the Los Angeles office of the Internal Revenue Service. Speier, as well as 
FBI Special Agent Charlie J. Parsons, who heads the FBI's Los Angeles field 
division, joined Manella at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to charge Tucker with income tax violations also suggests that 
federal officials do not believe he deposited the bribe money in campaign fund 
accounts. Tucker would not be required to declare money deposited in those 
accounts on his tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment does not force Tucker to relinquish his congressional post. It 
merely details the charges against him. He can continue to do his job unless he 
is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Under House rules, members who hold committee chairmanships are forced to step 
down while they contest criminal charges -- those rules are what forced 
Illinois Rep. Dan Rostenkowski to give up his powerful chairmanship of the Ways 
and Means Committee while he fights a 17-count indictment charging him with 
fraud, embezzlement and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tucker is a freshman congressman and does not hold any chairmanships. 
Nevertheless, the indictment is a blow to Tucker's political career. 
</P>
<P>
 He was fired from his post as a deputy district attorney with the county in 
1988 and later pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges in a case where he was 
accused of altering an official document and lying to a judge about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But three years later, he recovered and became Compton's youngest mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 After holding that seat for less than two years, Tucker entered a hotly 
contested congressional campaign to succeed Mervyn Dymally. Tucker beat out 
Dymally's daughter for that seat in the June, 1992, primary and took office the 
following January. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker is seeking reelection to that seat. It is extremely unlikely that his 
trial could be concluded before Election Day. He is scheduled to be arraigned 
Aug. 22, after which a trial date will be set. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the charges in the indictment involve Tucker's actions in Congress. 
They grow out of a volatile trash incineration debate that divided the Compton 
City Council in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, officials would not discuss the events that led up to 
their investigation, except to say that it was sparked by a complaint and that 
it involved Compton Energy Systems, a firm seeking to build a trash 
incineration plant in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, an official from Compton Energy Systems came to 
authorities in the early 1990s to complain that Compton officials were 
demanding bribes in exchange for support of the trash incineration proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI agreed to send an undercover agent to pose as a representative of that 
company after receiving the complaint. The agent, accompanied by company 
officials, then held numerous meetings with Tucker and other officials, 
offering them the bribes they demanded, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Tucker, sources said the FBI investigation targeted 
then-Councilwoman Patricia Moore. Moore was not indicted, and officials would 
not comment on whether she is cooperating with the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover agent delivered seven payments to Tucker, according to the 
sources and the indictment. Six payments, totaling $29,000, were in cash, while 
one was a $1,000 check, the indictment states. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the sources, at least some of the meetings were recorded on 
videotape. The payments began in June, 1991, and the final $10,000 payment was 
made on July 31, 1992, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal reached the City Council the next month and touched off an 
acrimonious council debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker introduced the proposal from Compton Energy Systems, saying it was an 
idea that would bring jobs to the city and help reduce the need for landfills. 
But Tucker's chief rival at the time, then-Councilman Omar Bradley, hotly 
denounced the plant, saying it was just another example of eco-racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I was reading about odors and the toxicity of the ash," Bradley 
said Thursday. "And I kept hearing about these pollution-generating plants 
being built in African American communities. So, yes, I was opposed." 
</P>
<P>
 That day, however, Bradley, who is now the mayor, lost his usually firm 
majority. Councilwomen Moore and Jane D. Robbins sided with Tucker in a 3-2 
vote to grant Compton Energy Systems an exclusive negotiating agreement with 
the city. Bradley and Councilwoman Bernice Woods opposed the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement said Compton would not consider any other waste-to-energy plants 
for 360 days. That agreement has long since run out, but nobody in the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency -- the lead agency in the matter -- would 
comment on what came of the plant proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker's indictment makes him the ninth sitting member of Congress to face 
criminal charges since 1990 and one of nearly 100 indicted since the nation 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 In those 200 years, charges against members of Congress have run the gamut of 
criminal offenses -- from violations of campaign finance laws to perjury, 
treason and manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Department of Justice has been criticized for targeting 
black officials for prosecution. Thursday's indictment, which was approved by 
Justice Department officials in Washington, reignited that debate, with some 
critics accusing federal prosecutors of singling out Tucker because of his 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Harold E. Ford (D-Tenn.), who was the subject of a long federal 
investigation that ended with his acquittal, termed the action against Tucker 
"a clear example of the leftover Reagan-Bush prosecutors who are overzealous 
and dominate these (U.S. attorney) offices." 
</P>
<P>
 "Blacks have been singled out for many, many years," Ford said, "and their 
cases do not receive proper review." 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton, Royce Esters, president of the local chapter of the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People, said he too viewed the charges with 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks to me like some kind of conspiracy is going on here, some kind of 
entrapment," Royce said. "Every time you turn around there's some kind of 
indictment against a black leader, a black politician." 
</P>
<P>
 Manella, however, vigorously denied that Tucker was singled out because of his 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I am concerned, this office is an equal-opportunity prosecutor," 
Manella said. "We pursue malfeasance under the federal statutes against persons 
regardless of race, gender, party affiliation or place of domicile."

<P>
 Eric Corley, a.k.a. Emmanuel Goldstein -- patron saint of computer hackers and 
phone phreaks -- is having a party. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps it is just in time. 2600, the hacker magazine Corley started when 
he was 23, is a decade old. It has spawned monthly hacker meetings in dozens of 
cities. It has been the target of a Secret Service investigation. It has even 
gone aboveground, with newsstand sales of 20,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the wild expansion of the computer and phone networks that have 
traditionally been hacker stomping grounds -- and an accompanying rise in 
electronic crime -- has made life more complicated for Corley and others in the 
computer underground who claim to adhere to a higher ethical standard. 
</P>
<P>
 And as more corporations rely on electronic communications to conduct daily 
business, computer security -- once the exclusive concern of elite computer 
technicians and their mischievous adversaries -- is now a topic of heated 
public debate. Many are calling for tighter restrictions on those who roam 
their digital networks, and tough criminal penalties for unauthorized 
activities -- even those that stop short of information theft or vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 As hundreds of hackers converge in New York City this weekend to celebrate 
2600's anniversary, Corley hopes to grapple with how to uphold the "hacker 
ethic," an oxymoron to some, in an era when many of 2600's devotees just want 
to know how to make free phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 (Less high-minded activities -- like cracking the New York City subway's new 
electronic fare card system -- are also on the agenda). 
</P>
<P>
 For Corley and other purists, the hacker ethic begins with the notion that 
"all information should be free." They view themselves as valiant holdouts 
against complete corporate and government control of ever-more-powerful 
information technologies. They break into computers, copy software and tease 
computer system administrators not out of greed or malice, they say, but out of 
a desire to understand the high-tech infrastructure and to keep the technocrats 
honest -- and they say they take pains to do no harm. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an outlook that tends to run contrary to the principles of private 
property and ownership under capitalism. Businesses whose computers and phone 
systems are broken into in the interest of exploration and the greater good of 
society generally do not think much of hacker ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither do law enforcement officials. "They say they're doing it for the 
intellectual pursuit, and that sounds real nice," said James Settle, former 
head of the FBI's Computer Crime Squad, who was responsible for the indictment 
of "Phiber Optik," an outspoken New York hacker who went to jail for computer 
trespassing this year. "But there are much bigger ramifications." 
</P>
<P>
 Corley's magazine takes its name from the 2600-hertz tone that used to control 
AT&T's switching system. Mimicking it -- a way to gain free access to 
long-distance lines -- was one of the first hacks learned by phone phreaks, 
those who focus on illicit entry into the public phone network. Legendary phone 
phreak John Draper, for example, received his alias, "Captain Crunch," after 
discovering the whistle in a Cap'n Crunch cereal box emitted a perfect 2600 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the phone company has long since abandoned the signal, the 
fundamental problem of defining a hacker morality remains much the same. "How 
do we know what constitutes criminal behavior and what does not?" asks Corley 
in a recent 2600 editorial. "Regrettably, the law no longer seems an accurate 
definer. With many of us, we just know when something doesn't feel right. And 
in such a case, trusting your instincts is always a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The 2600 editor in chief, who wears his hair long and sports a tool belt full 
of electronic gadgets, is quick to condemn the paranoia that he says amounts to 
a desire to stifle innovation and put the best and brightest explorers of the 
electronic frontier behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 But Corley also goes as far as wishing that fewer people bought his magazine: 
"It's gotten a lot bigger, which can be a bad thing, because a lot of people 
don't really understand what hacking is about," Corley said. "It requires a 
certain kind of spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Many law enforcement officials -- and engineers charged with maintaining 
security on corporate and governmental computer systems -- say they could do 
without hacker spirit of any kind. They are genuinely spooked by a huge 
increase in computer break-ins in recent years, and by the emergence of 
sophisticated hacking techniques that they do not understand. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ongoing attack on the Internet network that has extended into military 
computers and alarmed system administrators throughout the world, hundreds of 
thousands of passwords have been stolen by intruders using a program known as a 
"sniffer," which records the first 128 keystrokes of every message that passes 
through a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Security experts have been unable to trace the source of the attacks. But 
there is no evidence that the passwords have been used to harm or steal 
anything. "It's probably too early to tell if it's just an 'intellectual 
enterprise,' " said Dain Gary, manager of the Computer Emergency Response Team, 
a government-funded agency at Carnegie Mellon University that investigates 
security violations on the Internet. "But the point is the integrity of those 
systems has been compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 The team received 773 break-in reports in 1992. This year, the agency 
estimates that it will receive more than 2,300 reports. Many local law 
enforcement authorities now view computer crime as a major threat, and are 
training investigators accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no one likes to admit being a victim of break-ins, it is hard to 
assess the magnitude of computer crime. But security professionals believe that 
economic espionage via computer networks is on the rise.  
</P>
<P>
 And they say that the criminal hacker stunts of earlier years -- such as Los 
Angeles-based Kevin Poulsen manipulating radio call-in contests to win free 
Porsches -- are being replaced by higher-stakes hacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want me to screw around with your credit report? I can get that done for 
less than $1,000," Settle said. "Just to get a report would probably cost me 
only $400. Why bomb the World Trade Center? Just shut down the power grid. 
There are hackers claiming from foreign countries that they can shut down the 
air conditioning in any city in the U.S. It's all remotely monitored. You get 
to that computer, you can make the building you're in right now 105 degrees." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary said one problem is the lack of a value system. "Cyber-ethics are not 
being taught. Parents don't know what their kids are doing. The kids themselves 
think of it as joy riding -- but joy riding can be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Hackers counter that in a society increasingly dependent on technology, the 
very basis for democracy could be threatened by limiting technological 
exploration. "Hacking teaches people to think critically about technology," 
says Rop Gonggrijp, a Dutch hacker who will attend the Hackers on Planet Earth 
conference this weekend. "The corporations that are building the technology are 
certainly not going to tell us, because they're trying to sell it to us. Whole 
societies are trusting technology blindly -- they just believe what the 
technocrats say." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonggrijp, 26, publishes a magazine much like 2600 called Hack-Tic, which made 
waves this year with an article showing that while tapping the mobile phones of 
criminal suspects with radio scanners, Dutch police tapped into thousands of 
other mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "What society needs is people who are independent yet knowledgeable," 
Gonggrijp said. "That's mostly going to be young people, which society is 
uncomfortable with. But there's only two groups who know how the phone and 
computer systems work, and that's engineers and hackers. And I think that's a 
very healthy situation." 
</P>
<P>
 2600 and its supporters have an unlikely ally in AT&T computer security expert 
Kevin Hanely, who plans to attend HOPE and says he is looking forward to 
meeting the infamous "Emmanuel Goldstein." 
</P>
<P>
 "I sometimes wonder how he knows so much," Hanely admits, noting that 2600 has 
published articles on several internal AT & T documents over the years. "And 
I'm concerned when the information he shares gets into the hands of people who 
use it as a tool to hurt the customers that I try to represent. But we 
recognize the distinction between the hacker community and a community of 
criminal abusers." 
</P>
<P>
 AT & T just formed an investigative team to stage electronic stakeouts on 
systems known to be violated in an effort to "take the bad hackers off the 
street." Hanely said: "Hopefully the true hacker, the hacker who believes in 
the ethic of information and knowledge expansion will laud these efforts, 
because we're going to help untarnish their image." 
</P>
<P>
 LA Cellular appears to take a less sanguine view. The company says it hopes to 
find and prosecute a hacker who broke into a call between John Scott, the 
firm's director of engineering, and his wife this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "TEK," as the hacker calls himself -- it's short for "The Electronic Knight" 
-- showed up at last week's Los Angeles 2600 meeting in Union Station, armed 
with a notebook computer and cellular phone. The 19-year-old college student 
has written a computer program that allows him to track cellular calls 
throughout the region and trace the phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 TEK and a friend found Scott in the Cerritos Sheraton bar one evening. After 
disconnecting him from his wife, they listened as he called the office to 
demand that his engineers track them down. They paged him at the hotel, and 
left messages on his voice mail. The following week, TEK says, he called Scott 
back and the engineer told him that he should come work at the company's fraud 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He offered to buy my equipment, but I said no way. I'm not in it for the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he says he has stayed on the right side of the blurry line that 
separates hacking from criminal behavior. He has nothing but scorn for the 
hangers-on at the meeting who want him to help them reprogram their cellular 
phone so they can make free calls. "That's kiddie stuff," he said. "I do this 
because it's cool to figure things out, to do stuff no one else has done 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the elaborate measures they use on-line to disguise their identities, 
hackers flock to meetings like HOPE and the monthly 2600 gatherings. Attendance 
dropped off a bit, however, after a meeting in a Washington shopping mall in 
1992 was broken up by mall police who were working with the Secret Service. 
(The illegal activities discussed in the magazine have long drawn the interest 
of the Secret Service, which along with the FBI is responsible for 
investigating federal computer crime). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the desire to share information and meet other people like themselves 
is strong. The younger ones introduce themselves nervously by their handles. 
The older ones look out for police. Meetings are always held near banks of pay 
phones, so other meetings nationwide can be called. 
</P>
<P>
 At Union Station, about two dozen men and a few women, most in their teens and 
early 20s, gather around TEK's computer, plugged into a handy outlet by the 
phones, until a guard breaks the meeting up. 
</P>
<P>
 Corley said: "One thing we tell people is if you want to know if you're really 
a hacker, look and see if people are chasing you around wanting to cash in on 
your skills. If they are, you're probably about to cross the line. If people 
think you're just wasting your time, they think it's all nonsense and you're 
wasting your whole life, you're probably a hacker." 
</P>
<P>
 Corley does not hack anymore. He was arrested in 1983 for allegedly hacking 
into a system that gave him access to the electronic mail of corporations 
including Raytheon and Coca-Cola. (Charges were later dropped.) "It had a 
one-letter password -- an a ," he said. The then-23-year-old was told it would 
not be wise for him to continue with his plans to publish his magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not big on taking advice from authority figures, he went ahead. But he now 
treads on the safe side of the tricky hacker dividing line, taking the role of 
hacker spokesman and sometime-caretaker of his young colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 That has not kept him entirely out of trouble. Numerous phone company 
attorneys have sent him "cease and desist" letters threatening lawsuits over 
2600 articles about their networks, (all of which promptly are printed in the 
next issue). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Settle, who left the FBI this year, says he repeatedly told his team 
that Corley was not doing anything wrong. "I have no problems with what 
Emmanuel does. We've been on panels together." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes described as the hackers' Fagin, Corley gave 22-year-old Mark Abene, 
a.k.a. Phiber Optik, a lift to jail, and responds to hundreds of letters from 
hackers and wanna-bes asking for information. He even finds himself giving 
advice sometimes: 
</P>
<P>
 "We get letters from people who say: 'I want to be a hacker, I want to get 
credit cards. We tell them you've obviously watched 'Geraldo' too much, this is 
not hacking. We say, read the magazine."

VOTE ON CRIME BILL IS BLOCKED; MAJOR SETBACK FOR CLINTON; LEGISLATION: NARROW 
225-210 DEFEAT ON PROCEDURAL RULE IN HOUSE MAY KILL $33.2-BILLION MEASURE FOR 
YEAR. PRESIDENT DENOUNCES GOP AND GUN-CONTROL OPPONENTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An alliance of GOP lawmakers and Democratic gun-control opponents successfully 
blocked the House from voting on the long-stalled crime bill Thursday, dealing 
a major blow to the Clinton Administration and throwing the future of the 
massive $33.2-billion legislation into grave doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans cast the narrow 225-210 defeat of a technical rule as an 
opportunity to redraft the bill to make it even tougher on crime. But Democrats 
said that the measure is probably dead for the year because no substitute is 
likely to pass the House without the provisions that Republicans oppose -- a 
ban on assault weapons and funding for after-hours school programs to keep 
violence-prone youngsters off the streets at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the vote, President Clinton denounced the lawmakers for having 
"failed the American people." He blamed Republicans and the gun lobby for 
defeating the bill on a "procedural trick" and demanded that Congress remain in 
session during a summer recess that is scheduled to begin next week to vote 
again on the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they ought to go home," Clinton said. "You know, the people who 
are committing these crimes are not going to take a vacation. I want them 
(Congress) to come back tomorrow and the day after that. . . . And to keep 
coming back until we give the American people the essential elements of this 
crime bill," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), who voted for the assault 
weapons ban when it was passed by the House earlier this year, said the final 
product that emerged from a House-Senate conference was an "unholy trinity of 
pork, posturing and partisanship." 
</P>
<P>
 After a late-night crisis meeting to discuss strategy with other Democratic 
leaders, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told reporters that he would 
try to revive the crime bill next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they struggled to come to terms with the magnitude of their defeat, 
despondent Democrats were skeptical that a crime bill could be enacted in a 
Congress already preoccupied with trying to save the President's foundering 
health care initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's criminal what happened," sobbed Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.) as 
she emerged from a Democratic leadership meeting with tears streaming down her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 The grim, stunned looks on the faces of Clinton's allies confirmed that they 
shared her assessment of what had happened: A coalition of Republicans and 
conservative rural Democrats opposed to gun control measures had defeated -- by 
a margin that was considerably larger than expected -- a technical motion that 
had to be approved before the crime bill could come up for final passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats generally avoided criticism of fellow party members who voted 
against the bill. Clinton, when asked about the 58 defecting Democrats, 
sidestepped the issue, focusing his ire instead on Republicans who had voted 
previously for the assault weapons ban, then voted against the bill Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's prospects for reviving the bill rest on hopes for an 
outcry by angry constituents. Polls have shown strong public support for the 
measure. The White House hopes that enough House members who voted against it 
can be convinced to change their minds to get the bill passed. "I think people 
will have trouble saying they didn't bring home a crime bill because the NRA 
told them not to," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to stir that anger, Clinton hastily added a crime-related event 
to his schedule for today. Dropping plans to swear in Stephen G. Breyer as a 
Supreme Court justice, Clinton will fly instead to Minneapolis to speak to the 
National Assn. of Police Organizations, which is meeting there. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore will handle the Breyer swearing-in. With Clinton's 
health care initiative also in trouble, the effective defeat of the crime bill 
on a procedural motion meant that the Democrats who control Congress may have 
to face angry voters in November with few legislative accomplishments to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing the crime bill vote "is a very, very serious blow to the President," 
said political analyst William Schneider. Because the measure addressed an 
issue that voters consistently rate as their top concern going into the 
November elections, Clinton's defeat is likely to reinforce the growing 
perception that Clinton is a "weak and ineffectual leader who cannot deliver on 
his promises," Schneider added. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake, both sides waged one of the fiercest lobbying campaigns 
in recent memory in the days leading up to the vote, with Clinton making a 
series of last-minute appeals to wavering lawmakers on a telephone line that 
the White House kept open to the Democratic cloakroom. White House Chief of 
Staff Leon E. Panetta met personally with lawmakers throughout the day and as 
the vote approached he and other senior Administration officials predicted that 
the outcome would be extremely close -- decided by no more than two or three 
uncommitted Democratic votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 15-vote margin by which the procedural motion lost was a double blow 
to the bill's supporters because it underscored the Democratic leadership's 
failure to keep its own troops in line on an issue that directly affected the 
President's prestige and is likely to resonate loudly at the polls in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this vote was important for the Administration, it was critical for 
members of Congress," agreed Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. "Incumbents are 
looking at tough times this year and the only way for them to run is on a 
platform of accomplishments." But with health care reform in trouble and the 
crime bill now thrown into legislative limbo, it looks increasingly unlikely 
that Congress will be able to deliver any major accomplishments this year, 
Mellman added. 
</P>
<P>
 Before their defeat, Democratic leaders said that they needed at least 10 
Republican votes to offset the defection of anti-gun control Democrats and 
prevail on the motion that would have cleared the way for the crime bill's 
then-certain passage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they won 11 Republican votes but they were not enough to offset 
the much larger than expected defection of 58 Democratic supporters of the 
National Rifle Assn. and other gun lobby groups that teamed up with the House 
GOP leadership to wage a fierce campaign against the bill because of a 
provision that would have imposed a 10-year ban on the manufacture and sale of 
19 assault-type weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a larger backlash from the NRA Democrats than we anticipated," said 
Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, one of the Republicans who supported the 
bill. "I am just stunned at what happened," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people were squeezed" by two forces, "the Republican Party and 
the NRA," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a leading sponsor of the bill 
who denounced the outcome as "despicable." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Clinton's plea to rescue the main components of the bill by voting 
over again, Schumer was pessimistic. "Anyone who thinks we can produce a new 
crime bill in the month remaining is smoking something," he said bitterly, 
adding that it is "going to be very hard to resuscitate any crime bill" this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior Democrat concurred but acknowledged privately that the White 
House was having a hard time accepting "the reality of our defeat" because of 
the high stakes involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's vote promises to be a major issue in California's U.S. Senate race, 
where crime has already dominated the campaign debate. After the vote, 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein sharply criticized her Republican rival, Rep. 
Mike Huffington of Santa Barbara, for voting with the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill is literally hundreds of additional police officers in Los Angeles 
that Mr. Huffington just turned his back on," Feinstein said in a press 
conference. "California is deeply troubled by crime and violence, by gangs and 
by drugs. So the people are going to have to speak and the way they have to 
speak is with their vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, the Senate author of the assault weapons ban, said she was hopeful 
that the bill could be salvaged. "Let's not dwell in defeat until the battle is 
really over," she said. "The battle is not over." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who voted to support an earlier version of the crime bill last 
April, said that he joined the opposition Thursday because of the legislation's 
crime prevention package. 
</P>
<P>
 "America does not need a spending bill that creates new welfare programs," he 
said. "I know that if the conferees work on a bipartisan basis and report out a 
better bill we can pass good, tough crime legislation this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping crime bill was to have made good on one of Clinton's main 
campaign promises to provide the funds to put another 100,000 police officers 
on the streets of American cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Its broad mix of crime protection and prevention measures also included $7.4 
billion for new community programs designed to dissuade youngsters from joining 
street gangs by providing them with after-hours sports and cultural activities 
at public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Its main crime protection components would have expanded the death penalty to 
cover more than 50 federal offenses, provided nearly $9 billion in matching 
grants for new prison construction and mandated sentences of life imprisonment 
for three-time convicted felons -- the so-called "three strikes and you're out" 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the programs, funded over a six-year period, would have been financed 
by a special trust fund fed by savings expected to accrue from a plan to cut 
the federal bureaucracy by more than 250,000 workers over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest proportion of funding -- about two-thirds of the $33.2-billion 
total -- would have gone to law enforcement agencies, including $8.8 billion to 
help state and local governments hire 100,000 more police for street beats and 
community policing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the expanded provisions for capital punishment, the death penalty would 
have been extended to include such crimes as drive-by murders, car-jacking 
slayings and major drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the bill contained many features that both Democrats and Republicans 
had sought -- and which lawmakers from both parties said their constituents 
wanted -- the Republicans complained that the bill was larded with too many 
wasteful pork-barrel projects inserted in conference to win members' votes, 
citing a $10-million grant that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks 
(D-Tex.) inserted for his alma mater, Lamar University. 
</P>
<P>
 They also derided much of the spending included under the crime prevention 
provisions of the bill, saying that it amounted to little more than a thinly 
disguised attempt to re-wrap some of the social projects that Clinton was 
forced by congressional opposition to remove from his economic stimulus package 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our children don't need more midnight basketball. Our children don't need 
more arts and crafts. . . . Our children need more law enforcement," declared 
Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans who supported the bill, however, said that wasteful spending had 
nothing to do with their GOP colleagues' real objections to the package. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NRA and the assault weapons ban -- that was the stealth issue here and it 
had nothing to do with pork," Roukema said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Shays, the Connecticut Republican who led the effort to round 
up GOP support for the bill, added that opposition by the NRA and political 
strong-arm tactics by the Republican National Committee in the end sent his 
colleagues "running for their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 In a not-so-subtle threat, the Republican committee sent all 38 GOP 
congressmen, who had voted for the assault weapons ban last May, a copy of a 
resolution adopted in the wake of that vote by the Republican Party in Alaska, 
which called on the committee to oppose the maverick Republicans' reelection 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Shays said that Republican operatives also called the district offices of the 
GOP weapons ban supporters to warn them that Republicans would not vote for 
them in November if they supported the crime bill rule.

 The $33.2-billion crime bill blocked Thursday by the House would have 
authorized: 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending $11.1 billion for state and local police, including $8.9 billion to 
help hire 100,000 new law enforcement officers to carry out community policing 
by learning about neighborhoods in an effort to prevent crime as well as catch 
lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tossing third-time violent and drug felons in prison for life if the third 
conviction is in federal court, but allowing the release of some over 70 after 
they served 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending $10.5 billion for prisons, including $8.7 billion for state prisons 
and $1.8 billion to reimburse states for incarcerating criminal illegal 
immigrants. Recipient states would have had to keep prisoners incarcerated for 
85% of their terms or make strides toward that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banning 19 named types of assault-style firearms and scores of others deemed 
by the government to meet assault-style characteristics. It would have limited 
magazine capacity to 10 rounds. It would have exempted 650 named firearms and 
all guns legally owned when the law took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending $7.6 billion for crime prevention programs and $1.3 billion for 
drug courts. The prevention money would have included $1.8 billion for the 
Violence Against Women Act, including money for shelters, and $1.8 billion for 
flexible Local Partnership Act grants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowing some nonviolent, first-time drug offenders to avoid mandatory 
minimum 5- and 10-year federal penalties. It would have been retroactive for 
people now in prison, and Justice Department officials believe 5,000 prisoners 
might have been eligible. The "safety valve" would have been limited to those 
who used no gun or threat of violence, were not organizers and never served 
more than 90 days for another crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating more than 50 new federal death penalty crimes. Many carried that 
penalty before the Supreme Court overturned capital punishment in 1972. But 
some would have been new, including car-jacking slayings, drive-by shooting 
murders and major drug-traffickers, even those not directly connected to any 
specific death.

DISNEY PROPOSES BIG CUTS IN WESTCOT PLANS; EXPANSION: REVISED 1,800 HOTEL ROOMS 
INSTEAD OF 4,600 THAT ANAHEIM BASED REDEVELOPMENT ON COULD SCOTCH DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Walt Disney Co. officials are proposing to scale back their $3-billion 
Disneyland expansion project, with current plans calling for the company to 
build fewer than half of the 4,600 hotel rooms it originally asked to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney now proposes to build only 1,800 hotel rooms during the initial phase 
of the project -- a move that radically alters the city of Anaheim's economic 
forecasts and threatens to undermine a tentative development agreement between 
Disney and the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "A reduced Disney investment in hotels seems like a prudent option," said 
Kenneth P. Wong, senior vice president of Disney's development division, said 
Thursday. He said reductions were being proposed to make the project more 
feasible financially. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined say how many hotel rooms Disney currently planned to build. 
"That's part of the negotiations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of hotel rooms on Disney's drawing boards is critical, since the 
city is depending on projected revenue from hotel room taxes to pay for public 
infrastructure improvements in the Disneyland area. 
</P>
<P>
 If fewer hotel rooms are built, there will be less money available to widen 
sidewalks, enlarge sewer pipes and transform the dilapidated area into a lushly 
landscaped "garden district." 
</P>
<P>
 Slashing the number of hotel rooms would mark another setback for the project 
that was once hailed as potentially being one of Southern California's largest 
private construction endeavors, as well as a tourism magnet that would help 
revitalize the sagging local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is now about two years behind schedule. Disney has been balking on 
making the final decision to go forward, saying the project still is too 
financially risky to start right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Wong said, company officials "really want this project to go 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth acknowledged Thursday that city officials 
were reviewing revenue projections of the planned hotel and theme park project, 
but declined to discuss the city's ongoing negotiations with the Walt Disney 
Co. or any of the possible design changes being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly said both sides are diligently working to reach a final 
agreement on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The remaining issues are challenging, but I'm confident they can be 
resolved," he said. "Both parties are working very hard to make sure it's 
economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that "the city is being very careful to protect our revenues and 
preserve our long-term financial strength." Daly, too, declined to discuss any 
design changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Disney's original design, unveiled in November, 1992, 4,600 hotel rooms 
were to be built adjacent to Westcot, an internationally themed park that would 
be constructed on what is now the main parking lot of Disneyland. Combined with 
the 1,000 rooms to be renovated at the Disneyland Hotel, that would have 
provided some 5,600 Disney-owned hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The original design document stated that the resort's 97-acre "hotel district" 
would be the second-largest component of the expansion project. City officials 
apparently made their economic calculations on Disney building all the hotel 
rooms it originally sought permission to erect. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said the company may eventually build the maximum number of hotel rooms, 
but it is not now willing to guarantee that to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The project envisioned a major expansion in the number of hotel rooms because 
it was assumed that many visitors would spend two or more days at Disneyland 
and Westcot, and then visit other Southland tourist spots. 
</P>
<P>
 But a similar strategy has proven disastrous at EuroDisney outside Paris. 
Disney officials have acknowledged that they overbuilt hotels there, and blame 
that miscalculation as one of the reasons the European resort has piled up more 
than $1 billion in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said the EuroDisney experience was not a "direct lesson" that's being 
applied in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a tentative accord announced by Anaheim officials on May 2, Disney and 
the city had apparently reached agreement on how infrastructure improvements 
would be funded. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is asking local, state and federal agencies for some $800 million in 
public improvements, including street widening, burying utility lines 
underground and construction of two of the nation's largest parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's costs were to be covered by raising its current 13% tax on hotel 
room bills to 15%. But the revenues the city expected to collect were premised 
on the much larger number of hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does make sense to cut back on the number of hotel rooms," said Susan 
Putnam, analyst for the brokerage of Moran & Associates in New York. She said 
that the project deserves "rethinking" in light of a slowdown in attendance at 
Disney theme parks and increased competition in the West from the new 
family-friendly resorts in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 James C. Goss, an analyst for the Chicago brokerage Duff & Phelps, said that 
there are so many hotels already encircling Disneyland that the company could 
not hope to emulate its hotel-building success at Walt Disney World in Florida. 
There, he said, the theme parks are farther removed from the competition.

VOTE ON CRIME BILL IS BLOCKED; MAJOR SETBACK FOR CLINTON; LEGISLATION: NARROW 
225-210 DEFEAT ON PROCEDURAL RULE IN HOUSE MAY KILL $33.2-BILLION MEASURE FOR 
YEAR. PRESIDENT DENOUNCES GOP AND GUN-CONTROL OPPONENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An alliance of GOP lawmakers and Democratic gun-control opponents successfully 
blocked the House from voting on the long-stalled crime bill Thursday, dealing 
a major blow to the Clinton Administration and throwing the future of the 
massive $33.2-billion legislation into grave doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans cast the narrow 225-210 defeat of a technical rule as an 
opportunity to redraft the bill to make it even tougher on crime. But Democrats 
said that the measure is probably dead for the year because no substitute is 
likely to pass the House without the provisions that Republicans oppose -- a 
ban on assault weapons and funding for after-hours school programs to keep 
violence-prone youngsters off the streets at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the vote, President Clinton denounced the lawmakers for having 
"failed the American people." He blamed Republicans and the gun lobby for 
defeating the bill on a "procedural trick" and demanded that Congress remain in 
session during a summer recess that is scheduled to begin next week to vote 
again on the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they ought to go home," Clinton said. "You know, the people who 
are committing these crimes are not going to take a vacation. I want them 
(Congress) to come back tomorrow and the day after that. . . . And to keep 
coming back until we give the American people the essential elements of this 
crime bill," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), who voted for the assault 
weapons ban when it was passed by the House earlier this year, said the final 
product that emerged from a House-Senate conference was an "unholy trinity of 
pork, posturing and partisanship." 
</P>
<P>
 After a late-night crisis meeting to discuss strategy with other Democratic 
leaders, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told reporters that he would 
try to revive the crime bill next week.  
</P>
<P>
 But as they struggled to come to terms with the magnitude of their defeat, 
despondent Democrats were skeptical that a crime bill could be enacted in a 
Congress already preoccupied with trying to save the President's foundering 
health care initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's criminal what happened," sobbed Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.) as 
she emerged from a Democratic leadership meeting with tears streaming down her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 The grim, stunned looks on the faces of Clinton's allies confirmed that they 
shared her assessment of what had happened: A coalition of Republicans and 
conservative rural Democrats opposed to gun control measures had defeated -- by 
a margin that was considerably larger than expected -- a technical motion that 
had to be approved before the crime bill could come up for final passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats generally avoided criticism of fellow party members who voted 
against the bill. Clinton, when asked about the 58 defecting Democrats, 
sidestepped the issue, focusing his ire instead on Republicans who had voted 
previously for the assault weapons ban, then voted against the bill Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 All six members of Orange County's delegation voted against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's prospects for reviving the bill rest on hopes for an 
outcry by angry constituents. Polls have shown strong public support for the 
measure. The White House hopes that enough House members who voted against it 
can be convinced to change their minds to get the bill passed. "I think people 
will have trouble saying they didn't bring home a crime bill because the NRA 
told them not to," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to stir that anger, Clinton hastily added a crime-related event 
to his schedule for today. Dropping plans to swear in Stephen G. Breyer as a 
Supreme Court justice, Clinton will fly instead to Minneapolis to speak to the 
National Assn. of Police Organizations, which is meeting there. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore will handle the Breyer swearing-in. With Clinton's 
health care initiative also in trouble, the effective defeat of the crime bill 
on a procedural motion meant that the Democrats who control Congress may have 
to face angry voters in November with few legislative accomplishments to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing the crime bill vote "is a very, very serious blow to the President," 
said political analyst William Schneider. Because the measure addressed an 
issue that voters consistently rate as their top concern going into the 
November elections, Clinton's defeat is likely to reinforce the growing 
perception that Clinton is a "weak and ineffectual leader who cannot deliver on 
his promises," Schneider added. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake, both sides waged one of the fiercest lobbying campaigns 
in recent memory in the days leading up to the vote, with Clinton making a 
series of last-minute appeals to wavering lawmakers on a telephone line that 
the White House kept open to the Democratic cloakroom. White House Chief of 
Staff Leon E. Panetta met personally with lawmakers throughout the day and as 
the vote approached he and other senior Administration officials predicted that 
the outcome would be extremely close -- decided by no more than two or three 
uncommitted Democratic votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 15-vote margin by which the procedural motion lost was a double blow 
to the bill's supporters because it underscored the Democratic leadership's 
failure to keep its own troops in line on an issue that directly affected the 
President's prestige and is likely to resonate loudly at the polls in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this vote was important for the Administration, it was critical for 
members of Congress," agreed Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. "Incumbents are 
looking at tough times this year and the only way for them to run is on a 
platform of accomplishments." But with health care reform in trouble and the 
crime bill now thrown into legislative limbo, it looks increasingly unlikely 
that Congress will be able to deliver any major accomplishments this year, 
Mellman added. 
</P>
<P>
 Before their defeat, Democratic leaders said that they needed at least 10 
Republican votes to offset the defection of anti-gun control Democrats and 
prevail on the motion that would have cleared the way for the crime bill's 
then-certain passage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they won 11 Republican votes but they were not enough to offset 
the much larger than expected defection of 58 Democratic supporters of the 
National Rifle Assn. and other gun lobby groups that teamed up with the House 
GOP leadership to wage a fierce campaign against the bill because of a 
provision that would have imposed a 10-year ban on the manufacture and sale of 
19 assault-type weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a larger backlash from the NRA Democrats than we anticipated," said 
Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, one of the Republicans who supported the 
bill. "I am just stunned at what happened," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people were squeezed" by two forces, "the Republican Party and 
the NRA," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a leading sponsor of the bill 
who denounced the outcome as "despicable." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Clinton's plea to rescue the main components of the bill by voting 
over again, Schumer was pessimistic. "Anyone who thinks we can produce a new 
crime bill in the month remaining is smoking something," he said bitterly, 
adding that it is "going to be very hard to resuscitate any crime bill" this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior Democrat concurred but acknowledged privately that the White 
House was having a hard time accepting "the reality of our defeat" because of 
the high stakes involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's vote promises to be a major issue in California's U.S. Senate race, 
where crime has already dominated the campaign debate. After the vote, 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein sharply criticized her Republican rival, Rep. 
Mike Huffington of Santa Barbara, for voting with the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill is literally hundreds of additional police officers in Los Angeles 
that Mr. Huffington just turned his back on," Feinstein said in a press 
conference. "California is deeply troubled by crime and violence, by gangs and 
by drugs. So the people are going to have to speak and the way they have to 
speak is with their vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, the Senate author of the assault weapons ban, said she was hopeful 
that the bill could be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who voted for an earlier version of the crime bill last April, 
said he joined the opposition Thursday because of the legislation's crime 
prevention package. 
</P>
<P>
 "America does not need a spending bill that creates new welfare programs," he 
said. "I know that if the conferees work on a bipartisan basis and report out a 
better bill we can pass good, tough crime legislation this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping crime bill was to have made good on one of Clinton's main 
campaign promises to provide the funds to put another 100,000 police officers 
on the streets of American cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Its broad mix of crime protection and prevention measures also included $7.4 
billion for new community programs designed to dissuade youngsters from joining 
street gangs by providing them with after-hours sports and cultural activities 
at public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Its main crime protection components would have expanded the death penalty to 
cover more than 50 federal offenses, provided nearly $9 billion in matching 
grants for new prison construction and mandated sentences of life imprisonment 
for three-time convicted felons -- the so-called "three strikes and you're out" 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the programs, funded over a six-year period, would have been financed 
by a special trust fund fed by savings expected to accrue from a plan to cut 
the federal bureaucracy by more than 250,000 workers over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest proportion of funding -- about two-thirds of the $33.2-billion 
total -- would have gone to law enforcement agencies, including $8.8 billion to 
help state and local governments hire 100,000 more police for street beats and 
community policing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the expanded provisions for capital punishment, the death penalty would 
have been extended to include such crimes as drive-by murders, car-jacking 
slayings and major drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the bill contained many features that both Democrats and Republicans 
had sought -- and which lawmakers from both parties said their constituents 
wanted -- the Republicans complained that the bill was larded with too many 
wasteful pork-barrel projects inserted in conference to win members' votes, 
citing a $10-million grant that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks 
(D-Tex.) inserted for his alma mater, Lamar University. 
</P>
<P>
 They also derided much of the spending included under the crime prevention 
provisions of the bill, saying it amounted to little more than a thinly 
disguised attempt to re-wrap some of the social projects that Clinton was 
forced by congressional opposition to remove from his economic stimulus package 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our children don't need more midnight basketball. Our children don't need 
more arts and crafts. . . . Our children need more law enforcement," declared 
Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) ridiculed proposed funding for 
rehabilitation and crime-prevention programs as "criminal welfare" that would 
coddle convicts.  
</P>
<P>
 "People know that the way to get the attention of criminals is not to reward 
them with all kinds of benefits," Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite estimates that the bill would have funded an additional 240 police 
officers in Orange County, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) charged 
that cities would end up taxing residents to cover new police hires once 
six-year grants included in the bill run out. "That's not the way to bring the 
crime rate down," Rohrabacher said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless cities cut back on other services or raise taxes, the funds provided 
in the bill can keep, at most, 20,000 permanent cops on the street over the 
next six years -- that is the equivalent of only one new cop for every police 
department," said Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside). 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans who supported the bill, however, said that cost had nothing to do 
with their GOP colleagues' real objections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NRA and the assault weapons ban -- that was the stealth issue here and it 
had nothing to do with pork," Roukema said.

HEAT, HUMIDITY BAKE O.C.; LITTLE RELIEF IN SIGHT

 The sauna that is August in Southern California set in with a vengeance 
Thursday, baking Orange County in a haze of record-breaking heat from the 
inland canyons to the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 A sweltering 100 degrees was recorded at Irvine Ranch, 99 degrees in Lake 
Forest and 98 degrees in Tustin -- all surpassing the 96 recorded in Orange 
County on Aug. 11, 1933, a day highlighted by a meteor shower that was seen in 
the county, according to an almanac compiled by local historian Jim Sleeper.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, a meteor shower was expected late Thursday night into early this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like an oven," Fullerton Police Cadet Dan Allen, 21, said. "It was 
warm. I was running my air conditioner." 
</P>
<P>
 And forecasters say there is little relief in sight, with highs in the hottest 
parts of the county today nearing triple digits: 97 in Anaheim and Irvine and 
95 in Lake Forest. It was expected to top out at 93 in Santa Ana; San Juan 
Capistrano, 86; Laguna Beach, 83; Dana Point, 80; and Newport Beach 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures climbed into the mid-90s throughout much of inland Orange County 
on Thursday, the fourth straight day the mercury has passed the 90-degree mark, 
said Marty McKewon, a meteorologist for WeatherData, which does forecasts for 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highs included 92 in Santa Ana and 76 in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Even beach-goers seeking breezy respite up and down the Southern California 
coast were greeted instead with blasts of 90-degree-plus heat. Temperatures in 
balmy San Diego hit 86 degrees, breaking the second local heat record in two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dana Point, it was 84 degrees on the water, and hotter on land, where 
laborer Jose Salcedo toiled on Pacific Coast Highway. Amid the record-breaking 
heat and almost intolerable humidity, Salcedo was comforted by two best 
friends: his baseball cap and a water jug. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to keep drinking water," said Salcedo, 35, a Santa Ana resident 
who was helping to repair a crumbled hillside at the southern tip of Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
 His fellow worker, Jerry Salgado of Orange, added another heat-beating device 
-- a bandanna hugging his scalp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps the sweat out of my eyes," said Salgado, 34. "The only shade we've 
got is the visors on our caps." 
</P>
<P>
 The moisture from tropical storm Hector that was bringing clouds into the 
county "has all moved to the east," McKewon said, adding that the thunderheads 
seen above the San Bernardino Mountains Thursday were evidence of scattered 
showers in the eastern deserts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to stay hot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector not only brought clouds and humidity to the county, but a south swell 
that was increasing Thursday, particularly in Newport Beach. For surfers, the 
point breaks at 18th Street and 56th Street were breaking best, said Newport 
Beach lifeguard Lt. Jim Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The surf is about three to five feet today, and it's been good for the last 
couple of days," Turner said. But the waves kept lifeguards busy with more than 
80 rescues a day Wednesday and Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of the increasingly heavy surf and a strong southerly current 
caused Huntington Beach lifeguards to execute several mass rescues throughout 
the day Thursday, said Lt. Mike Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as a dozen people were rescued at a time, although no one was 
seriously hurt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The side current pushes quite a few swimmers into rip currents," Beuerlein 
said. "We just had five lifeguards in the water at one time between towers 3 
and 5. And that wasn't the first time today." 
</P>
<P>
 The humidity that lingered throughout the county Thursday is expected to 
subside today and this weekend, McKewon said. Thursday started out at 85% 
humidity in the county at 7 a.m. and, by 2 p.m., had tapered off to a more 
typical 27%, McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those wilting in the heat, the good news is that an increasing onshore 
wind should cool the coasts today, perhaps three or four degrees, McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone traveling inland should expect to be using the air conditioner or a 
portable fan. Places like Burbank, Lancaster and Palmdale, where the Mercury 
topped 100 degrees Thursday, are expected to be in the upper 90s today, McKewon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys, where it was 107 degrees Thursday, will again jump over 100 today, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air mass is basically stagnant right now. You're just getting intense 
heating," McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, it will remain warm and sunny with patchy low clouds at the 
coast in the morning and at night, McKewon said. Highs will stay in the 70s to 
low 80s at the coast, and up into the mid-90s inland, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike areas of the San Gabriel Valley, where air quality hit hazardous levels 
Thursday, smog levels were generally low throughout Orange County, according to 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 McKewon said the heat wave is due to a strong high pressure system. The system 
is supposed to be over the Texas Panhandle this time of year, but instead has 
migrated westward. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the system suppresses the down flow of air, it inhibits the formation 
of clouds, "allowing full solar heating over the Southern California area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the offshore airflow that normally moderates 
temperatures is almost nonexistent. "It's common in the summer to have a 
low-pressure system over the deserts, and this causes air to blow in from the 
ocean toward the lower pressure," McKewon said. "This cools off the coast and, 
to a certain extent, the valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the air mass is basically stagnant right now. You're just getting intense 
heating." It's Hot, Hot, Hot 
</P>
<P>
 While the thermometer hit a record 100 degrees at an Irvine Ranch weather 
station, the combination of temperature and humidity--measured by the heat 
index--made it feel hotter. Here is how the temperature recorded this week at 
WeatherData's Tustin station compares to record highs in previous years: 
04,11,10,13,22 Humidity Temperature Recorded high (date) Monday 55% 84 97 (Aug. 
8, 1950) Tuesday 41% 93 97 (Aug. 9, 1965) Wednesday 35% 94 95 (Aug. 10, 1965) 
Thursday 28% 98 90 (Aug. 11, 1971) Today* 31% 98 98 (Aug. 12, 1991) Saturday* 
25% 94 100 (Aug. 13, 1983) Sunday* 35% 92 97 (Aug. 14, 1983) * Forecast Heat 
Index: Here's How Hot It Feels 
</P>
<P>
 The heat index is derived from a formula that involves air temperature, 
relative humidity and the body's ability to cool itself. For example, today the 
temperature in Tustin is expected to reach 98 degrees with 31% humidity. That 
makes you feel as though the temperature is really 101.

OWNERS GRIPE AS BASEBALL STRIKE BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although some team owners questioned the strategy and direction of their 
collective-bargaining negotiations, there was no attempt Thursday to avert a 
strike by major league baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport's eighth work stoppage in 23 years began after Thursday night's 
final contest in Oakland. All games are cancelled; there were no negotiations 
Thursday, and none are scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players are resigned and resentful," said Donald Fehr, executive director 
of the Major League Baseball Players Assn. "They are resigned that this has to 
be and resentful that they are forced to do this in an industry that has 
enjoyed tremendous growth in recent years. They are forced to do this because 
the owners can't get their house in order." 
</P>
<P>
 A strike, Fehr said, is the union's only economic leverage against the 
likelihood that the owners will eventually declare an impasse and unilaterally 
implement a new compensation system based on a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The union contends that such a limit would restrict salaries, transfer 
millions of dollars from players to owners, eliminate salary arbitration and 
destroy free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything the owners have done has been aimed at setting up this 
confrontation and breaking the union," Fehr said. "The players have a choice. 
Take a salary cap now, take it after the season because (the owners) impose it, 
or strike. The owners have very deliberately left the players with no choices 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, said the players' decision to 
strike, disrupting one of baseball's most interesting seasons in years, is a 
tragedy for millions of fans. 
</P>
<P>
 He bemoaned the union's failure to respond to the salary-cap proposal, which 
he called central to the game's economic future because it would help balance 
revenue disparities between the bigger- and smaller-market clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch, however, came under fire from some owners Thursday, and there were 
several phone conferences among the owners, whose divisiveness during previous 
work stoppages undermined their negotiating efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 George Steinbrenner, the often-bellicose owner of the New York Yankees, who 
are leading the American League's Eastern Division, criticized Ravitch's 
refusal to let owners join negotiators at the bargaining table (an approach the 
owners had previously approved) and said Ravitch's argument that a salary cap 
was needed to achieve competitive balance "didn't wash." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the success of the small-market Montreal Expos, who have the best 
record in baseball this year and the World Series victories by the Minnesota 
Twins in 1987 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to what he said was the need for owners to participate in the 
bargaining, Steinbrenner told the Philadelphia Inquirer: "We must get people to 
the table who have considerable financial interest in the game, personal 
financial interest in the game. Not a bunch of lawyers who are the only ones 
that are going to make money out of the strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds, questioned Ravitch's negotiating 
experience, and Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos said a personality 
conflict between Ravitch and Fehr is preventing progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos added that the owners should pledge not to implement their salary-cap 
proposal in return for a no-strike pledge by the union through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably our best shot right now -- a quid pro quo," he said. "There's 
no way the issues at hand will be resolved in 24 hours or the next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago White Sox, dismissed the comments by 
Steinbrenner and Angelos. "George speaks for himself, and I don't think many 
people would agree with him," Reinsdorf said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with Mr. Angelos is he's new in the game and not fully aware of 
all the things that have been going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said it was a little late for no-strike pledges and promises from an 
ownership that seldom keeps them. He applauded Steinbrenner for his remarks on 
competitive balance and the need to have owners at the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone seems to be finally paying attention on their side," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Peter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, said the critical 
comments from other owners were unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the job tougher for both sides," he said. "We should all leave the 
negotiations to those involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the owners have a self-imposed gag rule, Ravitch said he and interim 
commissioner Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, welcomed dissent. He 
said 28 owners are never going to agree at all times, but "not one owner has 
suggested to me or Bud Selig that we should modify our proposal, and I talked 
to more than half of the owners today." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, I don't want to mislead you," he added. "No one likes where 
we are. We're all fans and we're all uncomfortable with this. The owners have 
big investments. All are going to lose money. No one likes to lose money, but 
they continue to reaffirm their support of our proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 With the owners and players seemingly polarized -- creating the possibility 
that the final 52 days of the season, along with the playoffs and World Series, 
could be wiped out -- President Clinton said in Washington that Labor Secretary 
Robert B. Reich continues to be in contact with the factions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done what we could to make some constructive suggestions," Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Fehr: "We have not even reached the point at which there is a 
conceptual framework within which we can negotiate a deal. I welcome any help, 
but I don't know what Mr. Reich can do right now."

RUSSIAN COURT CLEARS LAST '91 ANTI-GORBACHEV PLOTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, not one of the men who plotted to overthrow Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the 1991 failed coup will be punished: On Thursday, 
Gen. Valentin I. Varennikov, the last of 12 defendants, was acquitted of 
treason by the Military Collegium of the Russian Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought to a close a three-year trial that has degenerated from high 
political drama to disturbing farce. 
</P>
<P>
 The other leaders of the hard-line August coup, whose collapse brought on the 
breakup of the Soviet Union by the following December, have either died, had 
the cases against them dismissed because of poor health or been pardoned under 
a political amnesty declared by Parliament in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Varennikov, formerly deputy defense minister, was the only defendant to reject 
the amnesty and demand a trial, where he argued that it was Gorbachev who 
should be tried for treason for allowing the Soviet Union to disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70-year-old general said his only regret was that the coup, which 
horrified the world, failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's verdict was greeted by cries of "Thank you!" from about 150 
spectators who have come to the courtroom each day to cheer Varennikov -- and 
to heckle Gorbachev, who put in a cameo appearance last month to denounce the 
general's testimony as "arrogant lies" and "slander." 
</P>
<P>
 Varennikov, the former commander of Soviet ground forces, declared his 
acquittal to be "proof of Mikhail Gorbachev's guilt," and said he would now set 
about promoting "the revival of our fatherland." 
</P>
<P>
 Varennikov has asked the Russian prosecutor general to press treason charges 
against Gorbachev and called on Parliament to hold an inquiry into the breakup 
of the Soviet Union. He said it is now up to the authorities "to decide who 
should be put in the dock next." 
</P>
<P>
 In exonerating Varennikov, the court noted the general was not a member of the 
State Emergency Committee but did its bidding on the orders of his boss, 
then-Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov. Hence, the court said, Varennikov was 
only following orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the court found no evidence that Varennikov knew his orders were 
illegal, saying he had no way of knowing his superiors had placed Gorbachev 
under house arrest at his vacation home in the Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 Varennikov's lawyer asserted that Gorbachev had secretly gone along with the 
coup, a charge the Nobel laureate furiously denied. Gorbachev said he was held 
incommunicado for almost three days while the State Emergency Committee held a 
news conference claiming that it had temporarily assumed power because of his 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled that Varennikov's decision to support the coup did not 
constitute a betrayal of his country, the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 45-minute reading of the verdict, the court declared Varennikov's "goals 
and interests were not mercenary ones. . . . He was interested only in 
preserving and strengthening his country, which fully corresponds to the will 
of the people expressed in the referendum on March 17, 1991," in which Soviet 
citizens voted to keep the Soviet Union intact. 
</P>
<P>
 A Gorbachev spokesman denounced the ruling, saying it sets a dangerous 
precedent for Russia. "Now anyone who tries to organize a coup, fails, and is 
put on trial can say, 'I was following orders' and get away with it," said 
Vladimir A. Polyakov of the Gorbachev Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, in this country, the boundaries of reason are transcended," 
Polyakov added. "You can commit a crime, be put on trial, be acquitted and 
become a national hero. This is what happened today." 
</P>
<P>
 The only consolation, he said, was that because Varennikov was not a member of 
the State Emergency Committee, the court ruling cannot be interpreted as 
meaning that group is blameless; also at no point did the court say the 
attempted coup was legal. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new memoir, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin describes Varennikov as 
part of the "radical wing of the conspiracy" to overthrow Gorbachev, a man who 
personified the ambitions of the military-industrial complex. Among other 
things, Yeltsin writes that, on the first day of the coup, Varennikov made 
telephone calls and sent dispatches "demanding that this 'playing democracy' 
and 'the opportunist Yeltsin' be put to a stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Varennikov's acquittal became all but inevitable Wednesday when 
prosecutor Arkady Danilov asked the court to find the defendant not guilty, a 
move that is permitted under Russian law. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor general's office said Danilov was acting independently but has 
not said whether it agrees with his actions. The prosecutor's office can ask 
that the case be reviewed by the full Supreme Court, but none of Varennikov's 
foes held out hope that the verdict would be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, a Yeltsin spokesman tried to play down the case, saying the trial had 
become a farce and the acquittal was politically meaningless. "However much 
Varennikov and the other 'heroes' of yesterday puff out their cheeks (in 
pride), they will receive no political credibility," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gorbachev, who has hinted that he might consider a run for the Russian 
presidency in 1996, the decision was a final humiliation. The man who tried to 
make the Soviet Union into a nation ruled by law, not by arbitrary Communist 
Party fiat, had agreed to testify at the trial because he said he wanted to see 
Russians stop solving their problems by force. "We'll never accept the law if 
we forgive everything," Gorbachev testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Viktor Yaskin, the court chairman, said he did not doubt that public reaction 
to the decision would be "mixed." But he said the decision was based "not on 
sympathies, antipathies or opinions, but only on the law."

INVESTIGATORS FEAR TRAIL COLD IN STORAGE UNIT CORPSES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER and ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forensic experts began the grisly task Thursday of trying to identify three 
corpses found decomposing in steamer trunks in a Northridge storage facility, 
while police were stuck with few clues to determine how they got there except 
that detectives presumed they were murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, however, feared that the trail of a killer -- if there is one 
-- may have grown cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies, which coroner's investigators tentatively identified as those of 
two men and a woman, were discovered Wednesday by police investigating 
complaints of a foul odor coming from a U-Haul Co. public storage room shortly 
after the room's contents had been sold at auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies had been rotting in the two trunks and a large cardboard box for 
more than a year, authorities believe, and were so nearly liquefied that their 
race and age could not be determined. Some said cause of death may never be 
known; autopsies could be performed as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is being treated, of course, as homicide," said Officer Rigo Romero, a Los 
Angeles Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Working through the night and into the day, police searched through the 
cluttered rental unit, filled with a nauseating stench, in the building in the 
18100 block of Parthenia Street. So far, they said, they have found no wallets 
or other indications of who the corpses were or who placed them in the large 
trunks and then wrapped the trunks in layers of black plastic and sealed them 
with silver duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Deodorizers and mothballs had been placed about the room, apparently to 
conceal the smell, said Ed Zaharoff, 46, of Los Feliz, who bought the room's 
contents for $2,300. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they tried to track down the man who had last rented the storage 
unit, police said, they found a trail of fake identities, addresses and other 
useless information -- heightening their concerns that they were on the trail 
of a killer who stashed his victims away in the obscurity of a locked storage 
room next to a roller rink, just off a busy thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things that we have found seem to be fictitious; addresses and those 
sorts of things," said Police Lt. Al Moen of the robbery-homicide division. "We 
don't have anticipation of any arrests any time soon." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, authorities say they hope to solve the mystery by determining the 
identities of the corpses and interviewing their friends and associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one detective: "Now, it's a matter of playing catch-up." 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were discovered after Zaharoff bought the contents of the abandoned 
storage unit sight unseen at an auction Wednesday and began removing the items. 
Alarmed by the smell coming from one of the trunks, he and a friend called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 After patrol officers found what appeared to be human remains in one trunk, 
the other trunk and the cardboard box were shipped to the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office, where they too were opened and found to contain bodies, 
Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaharoff is a professional scavenger who supplements his income bidding on 
such abandoned goods at auctions. Because he was allowed only a quick peek 
inside the rooms, he did not smell the decaying bodies until the leaking trunks 
were moved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Zaharoff had been ruled out as a suspect for now. 
</P>
<P>
 U-Haul company representatives had no comment except to say they were 
cooperating with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they can do little until they receive the results of the 
autopsies. But they cautioned that the bodies are in such an advanced state of 
decomposition that it may be impossible to get fingerprints from them, although 
teeth and dental work should have survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they would probably interview Zaharoff again, and those who rented 
storage units in the building, to see if any of them had seen or knew the 
person who rented the cubicle where the bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also said they will continue to pick through the contents of the 
rental unit for clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the unit, Moen said, were items such as dishes, silk clothes and stereo 
equipment and several sealed boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be gone through methodically," Moen said, "but probably not until 
after the autopsy."

DISNEY EXPANSION PLAN CUT BACK; ANAHEIM: THE COMPANY IS PROPOSING TO BUILD 
1,800 HOTEL ROOMS INSTEAD OF 4,600, SOURCES SAY. REDUCTION WOULD HAVE DRASTIC

<P>
 Walt Disney Co. officials are proposing to build less than half of the 4,600 
hotel rooms originally planned for their Disneyland expansion project, sources 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney now proposes to build 1,800 hotel rooms -- a move that radically alters 
the city's economic forecasts and threatens to undermine a tentative 
development agreement between Disney and the city of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "A reduced Disney investment in hotels seems like a prudent option," said 
Kenneth P. Wong, senior vice president of Disney's development division, when 
asked about the proposed cutbacks Thursday. He said reductions have been 
proposed to make the project financially more feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wong declined say how many hotel rooms Disney currently plans to build. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of hotel rooms on the drawing boards is critical, since the city is 
depending on projected revenue from hotel room taxes to pay for public 
improvements in the Disneyland area. If fewer hotel rooms are built, there will 
be less money to widen sidewalks, enlarge sewer pipes and landscape the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Slashing the number of hotel rooms would mark another setback for the project 
that was once hailed as one of Southern California's largest private 
construction endeavors, as well as a tourism magnet that would help revitalize 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is about two years behind schedule. Disney has been balking on 
making the final decision to go forward, saying the project still is too 
financially risky to build now. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Wong said company officials "really want this project to go 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth acknowledged Thursday that city officials 
are reviewing revenue projections of the planned $3-billion project, but 
declined to discuss the city's ongoing negotiations with Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly said both sides are diligently working to reach a final 
agreement on the project, which would consist of a new theme park adjacent to 
Disneyland, a hotel and shopping district and a 5,000-seat amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 "The remaining issues are challenging, but I'm confident they can be 
resolved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, too, declined to discuss any design changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's original design, unveiled in November, 1992, called for 4,600 hotel 
rooms. Combined with the 1,000 rooms to be renovated at the Disneyland Hotel, 
that would have provided 5,600 Disney-owned hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The original design document stated that the resort's 97-acre "hotel district" 
would be the second-largest component of the expansion project. City officials 
apparently based their economic calculations on Disney building all the hotel 
rooms for which it was seeking permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said the company may eventually build the maximum number of rooms, but it 
is not now willing to guarantee that. 
</P>
<P>
 The project originally called for a major expansion in hotel rooms because it 
is assumed that many visitors would spend at least two days at Disneyland and 
the theme park, and then visit other Southern California tourist spots. 
</P>
<P>
 But a similar strategy has proven disastrous at EuroDisney outside Paris and 
the resort has piled up more than $1 billion in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a tentative accord announced by Anaheim officials on May 2, Disney and 
the city apparently reached agreement on how infrastructure improvements would 
be funded. Disney is asking local, state and federal agencies for about $800 
million in public improvements.  
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim's costs were to be covered by raising the city's 13% tax on hotel room 
bills to 15%, based on Disney building the much larger number of hotel rooms.

DIGGING INTO A FOSSIL FIND; ARCHEOLOGY: SCIENTISTS EXCAVATING REMAINS OF PYGMY 
MAMMOTH UNCOVER TWO-FOOT TUSK THAT IS VIRTUALLY INTACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After hours of excavating a rare pygmy mammoth fossil, archeologist Don Morris 
scrambled up a steep, sandy cliff and broke the news to a colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a tusk down there," Morris said breathlessly. "It's really nifty. 
It's all in the sand, and it's in terrific shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, the prehistoric skeleton discovered earlier this summer on Santa 
Rosa Island came complete with a 25-inch-long tusk, gleaming like polished wood 
in the bright, noonday sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The fossil is believed to be the most complete skeleton ever found of the 
mammoth that often grew no larger than a Saint Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular creature stood about 3 1/2 feet high at the shoulder, weighed 
up to 500 pounds and lived as long as 75,000 years ago, scientists estimated 
after their first day of excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of scientists from across the nation began digging at the site Tuesday 
and by Wednesday they had already discovered key portions of the ancestral 
elephant's frame. By Thursday afternoon, the scientists had uncovered the 
entire skeleton and found all four legs of the mammoth intact, "even the little 
bones of the feet," park spokeswoman Carol Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully, two scientists used dental picks to scrape sand from the mammoth's 
pelvis bone, the joint that could hold the answer to the animal's gender. 
</P>
<P>
 A biologist cleared sediment from the mammoth's eye sockets with a trowel and 
brushed sand off the bridge of its trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 As the scientists worked earlier this week, the jagged edge of the spine, 
bleached white from exposure, stuck out sharply from the eroding sand dune. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the spine that first drew a San Diego geologist to the fossil in June. 
Without that chance discovery, the rare skeleton could have been lost to 
exposure or to the sea, which is slowly eating away the aqua blue cove barely 
100 feet from the dune. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the luck of science," said Morris, archeologist for the Channel Islands 
Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The fossil's location, mostly in loose sand, is also a stroke of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sand is like going through butter with a hot knife," said Larry 
Agenbroad, a paleontologist who studies mammoths at Northern Arizona University 
and the Mammoth Site in South Dakota. "I'm used to sand, but much more cemented 
sand." 
</P>
<P>
 The downside is that the steep slope makes it impossible to bring heavy 
equipment to the site. The digging is all done by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Every step on the eroding dune sends showers of sand down the hill. A bright 
orange safety fence is all that separates the scientists and their equipment 
from a sea cliff and the surf below. 
</P>
<P>
 Agenbroad speculated that the mammoth may have died in a landslide that 
covered it with sand. Scientists believe the body was quickly buried in sand, 
initially sparing it from erosion and deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 years ago, they estimate, a gully or arroyo developed, and water 
began running down the dune onto the remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rockwell, a geologist from San Diego State, pointed to a darker spot on 
the sand behind the fossil, indicating the path of the gully. 
</P>
<P>
 The water eroded one of the tusks and some of the bones. Agenbroad projects 
that the skeleton is still 75% to 85% intact. Scientists have found some 
fragments, including a piece of shoulder blade the size of a dinner plate, 
farther down the dune. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big discovery thus far has been the tusk. The two-foot-long extended 
tooth, made of the same substance as human teeth, survived for eons virtually 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Agenbroad has found nearly 100 tusks in a South Dakota sinkhole called the 
Mammoth Site, but has never excavated a pygmy mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
 From examining the tusk, Agenbroad began to speculate about the mammoth buried 
in the sand dune. He believes the animal was a male, about 40 years old. He 
also believes the pygmy variety descended from the Columbian mammoth, which he 
has found in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, the mammoth swam to the Channel Islands, which were once one 
land mass about three to four miles off shore. After generations in the 
secluded spot, the species began to shrink -- an evolutionary process common in 
island mammals.

 Firefighters launched an air bombardment Thursday on a wildfire threatening a 
housing development in Northern California's Sierra Nevada foothills.  
</P>
<P>
 Nine helicopters and 13 tanker planes dropped water and fire retardant on the 
1,360-acre Creek Fire that was burning within a mile of hundreds of homes. Only 
about 30% was contained by fire lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really bombarding the open area where there's no line," said Mary 
Hale, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire in the Stanislaus National Forest was pushed by 15 m.p.h. winds and 
threatened homes in the Cedar Ridge development outside Twain Harte, 150 miles 
east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 David Goldenberg, a spokesman at the fire command center, said the blaze might 
be fully contained by nightfall Thursday "if the winds cooperate. If they 
don't, it's going to be another tough day." 
</P>
<P>
 The approximately 1,000 firefighters were hampered by steep terrain, thick, 
dry underbrush in the narrow canyon and temperatures near 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs of the fire, which began Tuesday, are $4.5 million and climbing, Hale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, about 1,200 people were evacuated from summer camps and homes in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Quirk, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross, said only about 150 people 
remained in the evacuation center. About 525 youths from the summer camps had 
been retrieved by their parents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Albright, operations chief for the Tuolomne-Calaveras Ranger Unit, said 
the cause of the fire is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in California, a fire in Amador County that burned 100 acres was 
contained Thursday morning, state forestry spokesman Jack Doyal said. The cause 
of that blaze was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A new brush fire broke out Thursday afternoon along Interstate 80 near Boca, 
east of Truckee, consuming 1,000 acres in less than three hours. It was still 
spreading late Thursday, but no structures were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Nevada, firefighters expected to have full control of the 6,500-acre 
Holbrook Fire near the California-Nevada border that threatened 300 homes 
before veering in another direction. 
</P>
<P>
 That fire, 15 miles south of Gardnerville, was intentionally set Monday, 
Stacey Giomi of the Sierra Front Wildfire Cooperators said. Officials were 
looking for clues.  
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, members of the Assembly Natural Resources Committee sent a 
letter to Gov. Pete Wilson complaining that his Administration has failed to 
follow the provisions of a new law designed to help catch arsonists who set 
forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The bipartisan group of 14 lawmakers noted that on July 20 the governor signed 
an urgency statute to set up a toll-free hot line for the public to provide 
tips on arson suspects. The law also established a reward of up to $50,000 for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of wildfire arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers said these steps had not been taken and offered to pass 
legislation to provide extra funding if more money is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy McLeod, assistant secretary for resources, said the hot line 
(1-800-468-4408) will be up and running today. "This has been done as 
expeditiously as possible," McLeod said, adding that the hot line had to be 
integrated into existing regional arson reporting numbers.

WILSON PICKS 3 FOR REGENTS; EDUCATION: ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S NOMINEES TO THE UC 
BOARD ARE ETHNIC MINORITIES AND REPUBLICANS. SENATE HAD REJECTED PREVIOUS 
CHOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Six months after a Senate rejection of his choice for the University of 
California Board of Regents, Gov. Pete Wilson on Thursday nominated three new 
candidates -- all of them ethnic minorities, including two from Los Angeles -- 
to the powerful panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's choices are David S. Lee, 57, of Los Altos Hills, an Asian 
American businessman who was born in China; college professor Velma Montoya, 
56, a Latina active in civic and Latino organizations, and Tom Sayles, 43, 
director of public affairs for the Southern California Gas Co. All are 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The nominations come during a period of greater Legislature scrutiny of the 
regents and calls to diversify the prestigious board. Criticisms of recent 
student fee increases and pay and bonus packages for UC officials have focused 
attention on the regents. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor submitted the three names to the UC Regents Selection Committee, 
which reviews nominees to ensure that the board reflects the state's economic 
and cultural diversity.  
</P>
<P>
 In March, the Senate turned down Wilson's appointment of Saratoga businessman 
Lester Lee, who would have been the first Chinese American to serve on the 
Board of Regents. Opponents criticized Lee, who had served on the board for a 
year while awaiting confirmation, for going along with steep fee increases -- 
113% since 1990 -- and administrators' raises. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection of Lee, which marked the first time in 125 years that a 
governor's choice for the UC board had been turned down, angered Asian American 
groups, who questioned whether racism had played a part in denying Lee the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that month, the Senate rejected Rosemary E. Thakar, a Wilson appointee 
to the California State University Board of Trustees. Her Senate opponents 
charged that as an unconfirmed board member she had supported pay hikes and fee 
increases. But Thakar, whose son had unsuccessfully challenged a conservative 
senator in a 1992 primary race, angrily countered that she had been a victim of 
political retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects of confirmation for the latest nominees were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 David Lee, founder of the Qume Corp. and a former ITT and Data Technology 
Corp. executive, was appointed by then-Gov. George Deukmejian to the board 
governing the California Community Colleges and served from 1990 to 1993. He 
also was a founding member of the Asian American Manufacturers Assn. and served 
on the Council on California Competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya, who holds a doctorate in economics from UCLA, taught at Cal Poly 
Pomona, Pepperdine University and Chapman College. A member of the board of the 
Salesian Boys and Girls Club of East Los Angeles, Montoya also is a member of 
the National Council of Hispanic Women and the Hispanic National Policy Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Sayles, an African American, served as secretary of the state Business, 
Transportation and Housing Agency under Wilson and was state commissioner of 
corporations for Deukmejian. A former chief legal council for TRW, Sayles was a 
deputy attorney general in California and an assistant U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Sayles also served on the community colleges board of governors from 1988-91.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / FAYE FIORE: HUFFINGTON CAUGHT IN MIDDLE ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Huffington, the Republican congressman from Santa Barbara, has endorsed a 
woman's right to have an abortion. He has voted to lift the federal abortion 
gag rule. He has voted in favor of the bill that guarantees free access to 
abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 So how was it that our freshman lawmaker wound up in his shirt sleeves in the 
rain chasing women across a Washington front lawn to defend himself against 
charges that he is Randall Terry in a Faye Wattleton disguise? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems Huffington has accomplished what no other California lawmaker has, at 
least in anyone's admittedly short memory: He has succeeded in ticking off both 
sides in the ever-emotional abortion fray. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Republican Assembly did not endorse Huffington partly because 
of his vocal advocacy of a woman's right to choose. It would be difficult to 
count the times he's stood up in public and announced "I am pro-choice," 
leading one to conclude he's not exactly lining up with Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along comes Lynn Cutler, a former National Democratic Committee officer, 
who invited guests to her home for a recent fund-raiser with a letter 
denouncing Huffington as "everything that is antithetical to us as women and as 
Jews." Huffington is not really an abortion rights advocate at all, and because 
90% of the American Jewish public is in favor of a woman's right to choose 
abortion, that makes him anti-Jewish as well, she reasoned, prompting a 
horrified Huffington to station himself on her front lawn in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after that, a coalition of abortion rights groups held a news 
conference assailing Huffington as a traitor among their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's talking out of both sides of his mouth," said a miffed Marcela Howell, 
executive director of the California Abortion Rights Action League. "This man 
who calls himself pro-choice has voted more frequently with (conservative 
Orange County congressman) Bob Dornan than with pro-choice elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pity the poor voter trying to sort out this one as Huffington challenges 
Dianne Feinstein for her U.S. Senate seat. Is he for abortion rights or isn't 
he? 
</P>
<P>
 "I totally and unequivocally support a woman's right to choose," Huffington 
wrote in a recent letter to The Times. "I also support some sensible 
restrictions on abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 He backs parental notification in cases of minors under 18, although not 
parental consent. He supported the Hyde amendment that would have restricted 
federal funding for poor women except in cases of incest or when the mother's 
life was in danger. He also opposes federal funding of abortions except as a 
"last resort" when the state or county won't pay, but he voted against local 
funding for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Aha, say the abortion rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we say 'pro-choice' we are talking about no restrictions and no 
obstacles," said Jane Hasler Henick, president of the California branch of the 
National Women's Political Caucus. "When you start using terms like 'last 
resort' that suggests someone other than the woman will decide, and that's not 
a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion rights groups such as CARAL use two basic criteria when determining 
if a lawmaker is on their side: legality and funding. A true advocate endorses 
a woman's right to a legal abortion and funding if she needs it. 
</P>
<P>
 CARAL says that nine out of 14 times Huffington has "voted wrong," including 
supporting amendments that would have gutted the the Freedom of Access to 
Clinic Entrances Act, even though he voted for the act itself in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 So CARAL branded him a lawmaker who could not be trusted. Abortion influences 
blocs of voters as few other issues can, and the CARAL stamp can be indelible, 
the political equivalent of gum on your shoe. It doesn't rub off easily. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which leaves Huffington in the middle of a battlefield dodging bullets from 
both sides. But his odd predicament has Republicans who favor abortion rights 
firing a few shots at CARAL officials, whom they accuse of claiming to be 
nonpartisan while behaving like lackeys for the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 With all four candidates declaring themselves supporters of abortion rights in 
the state's senate and gubernatorial races, the critics ask, why doesn't CARAL 
just celebrate the fact and stay out of it? 
</P>
<P>
 "They have always been attacked as (lackeys for Democrats) and I have tried to 
defend them. But when they pull stunts like this, you have to wonder," said Ann 
Stone, national chairman of Republicans for Choice, in Alexandria, Va. "He's 
not anti-choice. The worst you can say is he's mixed choice." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the black-and-white world of abortion rights there is no such thing as 
"mixed choice." The activists contend that restrictions are dangerous, that 
when you start allowing lawmakers to draw lines, you make public policy of 
something best left between a woman and her doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson for Huffington may be this: In the war over abortion rights, the 
worst place to stand is in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he is learning as a novice . . . is there is no middle ground," said 
Larry Berg, director of the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. "I 
suspect he was trying to find one. You can't be all things to everyone on 
abortion."

 The world's most prestigious institution of Islamic learning has spoken out 
against a U.N. document on population and development, accusing it of condoning 
extramarital sex and easy abortion. The Azhar, the mosque university set up in 
Cairo in the 10th Century, says the document also undermines parental authority 
and might encourage prostitution.In a statement, its Islamic Studies Center 
said parts of the document needed changing to conform with Islamic principles 
and recommended Muslims record their reservations on them at a U.N. conference 
in Cairo next month. The document, the program of action for the International 
Conference on Population and Development, covers a wide range of subjects 
controversial in the Islamic world, such as abortion, women's rights and family 
structures.

CLINTON TO URGE END OF BOSNIA ARMS EMBARGO IF SERBS BALK; BALKANS: U.S. WILL 
ASK U.N. TO LIFT CURBS IN OCTOBER, MAY SUPPLY MUSLIMS, UNLESS PEACE PLAN IS 
ACCEPTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, hoping to head off a confrontation with Congress, said in a 
letter made public Thursday that he will urge the U.N. Security Council to lift 
the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina if Bosnian Serb forces do not agree 
to a peace plan by mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter to Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, Clinton also indicated that he would end American compliance with 
the embargo, permitting Washington to send weapons to the Muslim-led 
government, if the Security Council fails to act "within a reasonable period of 
time," presumably sometime in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's latest formula for dealing with the bloody ethnic conflict 
parallels a provision written by House and Senate negotiators into the 
compromise defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision would prohibit the Pentagon from spending money to enforce the 
embargo after Nov. 15 if the warring factions have not agreed on a settlement 
by then. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton's words had the sound of an ultimatum, the President, in 
effect, gave the rebel Bosnian Serbs two more months to hold out against a 
peace proposal advanced last month by the United States, Russia, Britain, 
France and Germany that would give the Serbs 49% of Bosnia's territory, a 
substantial rollback from the 70% they now control. 
</P>
<P>
 "If by Oct. 15, the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted the proposal, it would be 
my intention within two weeks to introduce formally and support a resolution in 
the United Nations Security Council to terminate the arms embargo" on the 
Bosnian government, Clinton wrote. "Further . . if the Security Council for 
some reason fails to pass such a resolution within a reasonable period of time, 
it would be my intention to consult with the Congress thereafter regarding 
unilateral termination of the arms embargo." 
</P>
<P>
 With Congress firmly on record in favor of ending the embargo, Clinton's 
position would seem to leave him with no alternative other than to lift the 
weapons ban unilaterally if the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted a peace 
settlement by November. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said Clinton is reluctant to take such an action 
because "there are considerable downsides diplomatically and politically." The 
President's pledge to consult with Congress about the matter sometime in 
November appears intended to gain a little time and prevent the lawmakers from 
forcing his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 When the five big powers submitted their proposed settlement, they warned of 
"consequences" if all factions did not accept the plan by July 30. The 
Muslim-led government and its Bosnian Croat allies accepted but the Bosnian 
Serbs did not. The five nations postponed a decision on how to punish the 
recalcitrant party. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Nunn urged advocates of American unilateral action, led by 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), to give Clinton's latest policy a 
chance to work. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to the lawmakers, Clinton said the embargo "has unfairly and 
unintentionally penalized the victim in this conflict." But he added that 
action by the United States to unilaterally end the embargo -- in effect 
defying a mandatory resolution of the Security Council -- "would have serious 
implications going well beyond the conflict in Bosnia itself." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our relations with our Western European allies would be seriously strained 
and the cohesiveness of (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) threatened," 
he wrote. "Our efforts to build a mature and cooperative relationship with 
Russia would be damaged. It would also greatly increase American responsibility 
for the outcome of the conflict. The likelihood of greater U.S. military 
involvement in Bosnia would be increased, not decreased." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sarajevo on Thursday, two U.N. relief planes were hit by gunfire, shutting 
down the vital airlift of aid to the capital just two days after it had resumed 
after an 18-day halt, news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Sniper fire increased and convoys of government soldiers were sent to a combat 
zone north of the city. The incidents indicated that a 7-month-old break in the 
warfare around Sarajevo may be about to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Dacre Holloway, a U.N. spokesman, said that bullet holes were discovered 
in the planes after they returned safely to bases in Ancona, Italy, and the 
Croatian port of Split. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. peacekeepers also said that as many as 3,000 government troops moved to 
battlefronts just north of Sarajevo on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Associated 
Press reported. Buses and trucks loaded with more soldiers flowed in Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive apparently is aimed at breaking the Serbian siege of the city, 
which has been cut off from the rest of Bosnia for most of the war.

 Israel gave a Palestinian official permission to visit Jerusalem, the city 
claimed by both sides as their capital.Israel signed a peace agreement with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization in May but wouldn't let its officials visit 
the disputed city. Nabil Shaath, minister of planning in the Palestinian 
Authority running the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, will be allowed 
to visit Jerusalem's Muslim shrines, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's 
office announced. Shaath confirmed that, and said, "This ought to be a matter 
of fact. We ought to be able to see Jerusalem, to pray in Jerusalem." 
Palestinian sources said he might visit as early as today.

MILITARY; DETERMINED NON-SECTARIAN APPROACH PUTTING LEBANESE ARMY TOGETHER 
AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARILYN RASCHKA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Strutting across a manicured lawn to the rhythmic pounding of drums and 
martial music, the blue-uniformed cadets of the Lebanese army dropped to their 
knees, accepted the swords of officers from their president and pledged to 
uphold the sovereignty and constitution of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 On this festive Army Day recently, it was hard to believe that this was the 
same army that had been beset by the foul national virus that kept Lebanon 
plunged in civil war for more than 15 years: corruption and militant 
sectarianism that pitted Muslim against Christian, brigade against brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the war, the army was left fuming, feuding and underpaid, 
and rebuilding it as a national institution resembled nothing so much as 
reassembling Humpty Dumpty after the fall. But the force, now 45,000 strong, is 
definitely on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the army has deployed throughout Beirut and central Lebanon -- 
including strongholds of Islamic militants such as Hezbollah in south Beirut 
and parts of the Bekaa Valley, and of the Druze in the Shouf Mountains. For the 
first time since the beginning of thewar, the Lebanese army now controls much 
of Lebanon, although Islamic militants still hold sway in the south and in the 
western Bekaa, and Syria deploys about 35,000 troopsthroughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the army's comeback, analysts here say, was supreme determination 
on the part of its top command, headed by Gen. Emile Lahoud, to turn the 
military force that would replace dozens of unruly militias and assert the new 
government's authority in Lebanon into a non-sectarian institution putting the 
nation's interests first. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigades once manned with just one sect each, or a predominance of one sect, 
are now integrated. Army battalions are rotated at frequent intervals, 
familiarizing the troops with all regions of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the country's civil war started in 1976, sectarian considerations 
outweighed competence and performance in the distribution of positions. Today, 
the army is living by the principle of "he who succeeds is chosen." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if 90% of those who pass advancement examinations are from a single sect, 
they are all promoted, an army spokesman explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacement of military hardware was facilitated in 1992, when the United 
States once again began providing Lebanon with non-lethal military assistance. 
Lebanon went on a buying spree, making a $40-million purchase that included 700 
Willis jeeps, 350 cargo trucks, assorted trailers, ambulances, patrol boats, 
helmets and flak jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 The army took another step toward national reconciliation when it accepted 
3,000 ex-militiamen into its ranks after extensive and rigorous "reconciliation 
courses." 
</P>
<P>
 Lahoud has made it clear, however, that he wants to limit the presence of 
ex-militiamen to no more than 10% of the nation's armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Disarming Lebanon's many militias has been one of the army's greatest success 
stories, but three groups still challenge the army's control: 
</P>
<P>
 * Palestinian groups, mostly opponents of Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat's peace agreement with Israel, have been allowed to keep 
lightweight weapons for self-defense, a legacy of the massacres in the Sabra 
and Chatilla refugee camps in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hezbollah, or Party of God, acting as a resistance force against Israeli 
presence in southern Lebanon, has been given relatively free rein there through 
an agreement brokered with Iran and Syria.  
</P>
<P>
 * The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army operates in Israel's self-declared 
security zone in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 The final healing of the army, analysts agree, will only come with the 
evacuation of all foreign forces from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 And many Lebanese officials fear that the army's newfound credibility could be 
lost if it is forced into a showdown with Hezbollah and the huge Shiite Muslim 
community it represents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the timetables are not set by the army. Damascus will ultimately decide 
the army's fate in southern Lebanon as Syria navigates its own course of peace 
with Israel, which still controls 440 square miles of Lebanese territory. The 
army's march toward national reconciliation continues to be an obstacle course 
of political considerations. Taking More Land 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the beginning of the civil war of 1975-90, the 
Lebanese army now controls most of Lebanon. Islamic militants still hold sway 
in the south and in the western Bekaa Valley, and Syria deploys about 35,000 
troops throughout the country.

TRANSPORTATION; OZONE LEVELS CURB GERMANS' NEED TO SPEED; A STUDY RELATING 
POLLUTION TO FAST DRIVING HAS A COUNTRY OF CAR LOVERS CHOOSING BETWEEN CLEAN 
AIR AND PUTTING THE PEDAL TO THE METAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The worst heat wave here in modern times has brought two great German passions 
-- speed and the environment -- into head-on conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, there are no speed limits on the German autobahns, and drivers like 
it that way. The right to drive with your foot to the floor is as dear -- and 
as comprehensible to foreigners -- as Americans' love of guns. No small number 
of drivers routinely go as fast as 125 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Germany, there is a special car ideology," says Karl-Heinz Ludewig of the 
small, Berlin-based Society for the Protection of Pedestrians. "We have sayings 
that reflect it. One is that a German man's favorite child is his car. Another 
is that the German man treats his car better than his wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Wife, schmife -- what about the air? That is the dilemma facing German speed 
demons this summer, because the heat has sent ozone levels soaring, and many 
scientists, politicians and environmentalists say that the air could be 
protected if drivers would just slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate started late last month, when ozone research in the state of Hesse 
happened to be completed just as Germany was entering its fourth week of a 
record-breaking heat wave. Hesse, it should be noted, has a coalition 
government of the liberal Social Democratic Party and the Greens. The study 
seemed to show that, by limiting auto use and imposing speed limits, the state 
could reduce ozone-causing fumes by as much as 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the government of Hesse committed the ultimate heresy: It 
imposed a speed limit. Drivers on the autobahns were supposed to slow to a most 
un-German 55 m.p.h. On secondary highways, they were told to go just 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Compliance was mixed, in part because the government didn't announce the 
imposition of a speed limit until 5:30 p.m., and the crews whose job it would 
be to post the signs had already left. But police claim that four out of five 
drivers obeyed the new provision, which had been announced on the radio. An 
opposition spokesman says this compliance was achieved by sending police cars 
cruising two and three abreast down the autobahns at 55 m.p.h., trapping 
everyone else behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 And after four days, the Hesse environment ministry announced that ozone 
levels "had been reduced dramatically," and some Germans began thinking twice 
about which activity they cherished more -- speeding or breathing. A poll by 
German state television showed that 69.4% of Germans liked the idea of a speed 
limit -- most thought 80 m.p.h. sounded about right -- and 86.3% favored a 
speed limit at times of high ozone levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, other states were considering speed limits, and some even tried 
setting them. In Germany, that takes guts. People here insist that, even though 
they drive faster, their cars are safer -- and would in fact lose their 
competitive edge if speed limits were imposed. And they say that, just because 
other countries have speed limits, that doesn't mean people obey them. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, one lead-foot has sued the state of Hesse, complaining that his 
personal rights are being curtailed. The auto industry has rallied, sending 
forth representatives to explain that what is really needed is not a speed 
limit but the development of an environmentally friendly car -- preferably with 
generous government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Chancellor Helmut Kohl took the unusual step of interrupting his vacation 
to tell reporters that he opposed speed limits, but he said the idea could be 
"intensively considered" once federal legislators return from their summer 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, of course, temperatures will have fallen, ozone levels will be 
down, and the impetus for a German speed limit may be lost. Highway Safety 
</P>
<P>
 According to insurance-industry research organization HUK-Verbandt, following 
are the numbers of highway deaths per 1 billion kilometers driven per year in 
these countries: 
</P>
<P>
 Germany: 6.8 
</P>
<P>
 France: 9.2 
</P>
<P>
 Austria: 15.7 
</P>
<P>
 Spain: 58.3

<P>
 Britain: 3.9

 United States: 5.8

CUBAN AMERICANS HOLD BACK ON FLOTILLA; CARIBBEAN: ATTY. GEN. RENO SAYS BOATS 
LEAVING FOR ISLAND COULD BE SEIZED. IN LIVE BROADCAST, CASTRO RIPS U.S. POLICY 
ON EMIGRANTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Warned repeatedly that they would be arrested and their boats seized, Cuban 
Americans here so far have resisted the temptation to launch a high-seas 
flotilla to Cuba to pick up relatives and bring them to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, people have learned the lesson," said Spanish-language radio talk 
show host Tomas Garcia Fuste, referring to the chaotic 1980 Mariel boat lift, 
in which 125,000 Cubans, including large numbers of criminals and mental 
patients, were allowed to flee to South Florida. "They do not want to dance to 
Fidel Castro's music. There will not be another Mariel." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, local officials remain concerned a week after an unprecedented riot on 
the streets of Havana and a clear threat from the Cuban president to open Cuban 
ports to defectors if the United States does not take "serious measures to 
guard their coasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, Castro reiterated his call for the United States to take 
"rapid, efficient and serious" measures to change its policy on Cuban 
emigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a television news conference that was broadcast live in Cuba and the United 
States, Castro also accused the United States of covering up the hijacking of a 
Cuban government boat and repeated the allegation that a Cuban military officer 
had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said the body of Cuban Lt. Roberto Aguilar Reyes was found Wednesday, 
two days after the hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hadn't found the body, they would have continued propagandizing that 
the man who hijacked the boat was the man who we say was killed," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees aboard the boat have told U.S. officials that no one was killed in 
the hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clinton Administration said Wednesday that 12 Coast Guard and 
Navy vessels have been ordered to head for the Straits of Florida, Dade County 
Manager Joaquin Avino admitted Thursday that "we face three days of lag time 
(between a declared emergency and the start of a military blockade), and we 
would be on our own holding them back." 
</P>
<P>
 Avino refused to divulge details of local contingency plans, but heading off a 
boat lift presumably would fall to police and marine patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
 To underscore the Clinton Administration's resolve to keep Cuban Americans 
from using private boats to pick up Cuban refugees, U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
said in a Thursday evening news conference that any vessels seen leaving South 
Florida for Cuba could be stopped and seized. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, minutes after Reno's remarks, U.S. Atty. Kendall Coffey announced 
that three men were in custody after they were found to have brought 22 Cubans 
into Key Largo. Coffey said the men could face charges of violating U.S. 
immigration laws and their 39-foot speedboat could be seized. 
</P>
<P>
 With Coffey at the Miami news conference were a dozen local officials, as well 
as Spanish-language media chiefs and exile leaders, all urging Cuban Americans 
to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no evidence that any flotilla is in the making. Said Avino: "The 
Cuban American community is not going to let Castro say what is going to happen 
here. Conditions are not the same as in 1980 (and not right) for another Mariel 
to occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one factor that has mitigated the desire of many in South Florida to 
sail to Cuba in hopes of taking relatives from there has been what Avino called 
the "silent migration," in which thousands of Cubans who enter the United 
States each year on tourist visas do not return to their native land. 
</P>
<P>
 Dade County officials estimated that as many as 30% of the 1,600 Cubans who 
arrive in Miami on charter flights each week overstay visas and do not go home. 
Other Cubans enter the country on illegal visas obtained in Costa Rica or the 
Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Avino estimated that as recently as two years ago, about 14,000 Cubans a month 
were entering the country as tourists, most of them to stay. Now, with fewer 
tourist visas being issued by American authorities in Cuba, that figure has 
been cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, whether they arrive on a visa or on a raft, as 400 to 500 refugees a 
month do now, no Cubans -- except for hard-core felons -- are ever deported. 
The United States treats all Cubans as individuals seeking political asylum; 
the United States has no deportation agreement with Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia Fuste said that many exiles who have been here for more than 10 years 
already have managed to bring their families from Cuba. "Only those who came in 
the last three years or so want to get family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of Mariel also remains strong and bitter here. Although a proposed 
naval blockade is designed primarily to stop a north-south flow of U.S. 
residents to Cuba, Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) said he could foresee a situation 
in which Cubans would be stopped at sea if there were evidence Castro again was 
sending criminals or other dangerous people to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials are also preparing. Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles said that 
refugees arriving in the Florida Keys or Miami would be sent immediately to 
reception areas as far away as Palm Beach County, identified and medically 
screened and bused to a larger staging area such as Homestead Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 From Homestead -- which is all but closed after being extensively damaged by 
Hurricane Andrew in 1992 -- the Cubans would be further dispersed to military 
bases outside Florida, Chiles said in a briefing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, the care and processing of illegal immigrants is a federal 
responsibility, and Avino said Reno and other top U.S. officials have assured 
him that responsibility will be met. But state and local officials know that 
South Florida resources will be taxed first by any massive influx of 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Distant Shore, the classified federal plan to deal with a 
Mariel-type emergency, earmarks $35 million to reimburse state and local 
governments for housing, food and health care. But under normal conditions, the 
cost of caring for illegal immigrants in Florida runs to $884 million a year, 
according to state estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Florida sued the federal government, saying its failed 
immigration policy costs the state as much as $2.5 billion a year in schools, 
hospitals, prisons and other public services. Chiles has said the federal 
government's failure to accept responsibility for the flood of illegal 
immigrants who arrive in Florida each year "has created a nightmare for state 
and local governments . . . (and deprives) our citizens of services we can't 
give them." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the slow-motion immigration continues. The Coast Guard reported 
spotting at least seven rafts in the Straits of Florida on Thursday; the number 
of Cubans who have sailed to this country this year has climbed toward 5,400. 
In 1993 -- a record year -- 3,656 sailed in on small boats and inner-tube 
rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities continued to question Leonel Macias Gonzalez, 19, the 
Cuban coast guardsman who reportedly hijacked the vessel from the port of 
Mariel on Monday. Cuban authorities say he is responsible for the officer's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Allen, an attorney representing Macias, said of his client: "He's very 
frightened. But he said he would spend 20 years in jail here rather than return 
to Cuba."

NO MIDDLE GROUND FOR FEARFUL RWANDANS; AFRICA: REFUGEES AT THE BORDER IN 
FERTILE SOUTHWEST MUST SOON DECIDE WHETHER TO FLEE TO MISERY OF ZAIRE OR FACE 
POTENTIAL FOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Just down the road is the border between Rwanda and Zaire. On this side are 
the flowers of virgin, mountain forests; on the other are raw city sewers and 
teeming alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no middle ground. These days, in these parts, every step leads to the 
extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a place where brutal tyrants have become meek, shoeless refugees, 
where victimizers are transformed into victims, where black Africans turn in 
desperation to white Europeans for the only help there is. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cyangugu, citizens loot their own country and plot vengeance on avengers. 
And all the time, there is fear in their eyes, because fear is their destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the border, Zairians ask themselves a troubling question: Why is their 
part of the country so much more a rubble heap than up the road in war-ravaged 
Rwanda? 
</P>
<P>
 The misery of these borders is full of unimaginable contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the landscape. Rwanda is a beautiful country. War and bloodshed 
have not changed that; 15 miles away, the Nyungwe forest is Africa from the 
picture books -- the grandest, most colorful of equatorial jungles, combined 
with Alp-like mountains. The road is wide and paved smooth. At either end of 
the forest are tea and banana plantations, thatch-hut villages. There is a 
misty timelessness to the landscape, a sense of order. Patients in hospitals 
sleep one to a bed, even in wartime. Water runs in the municipal pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 In this part of southwestern Rwanda, 1.2 million people are massed. Most are 
refugees from other parts of the land. In terraced camps on steep hills, they 
live in orderly rows of huts made of eucalyptus branches. The dirt is soft, the 
surrounding lands fertile. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the next week or 10 days, the people here will make their decision: Do 
they stampede into despair, inflicting on themselves greater disease and 
rootlessness than they already know? Or do they remain and face the enemy, 
whose heart they also fear they know? 
</P>
<P>
 If they flee, hundreds of thousands are likely to squeeze across the border 
here, shuffling over a one-lane wooden bridge into Bukavu, Zaire. They will 
follow another 1 million of their countrymen who crossed earlier into suffering 
at Goma, Zaire, more than 70 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 What awaits them? A country more deeply mired in poverty than their own, for 
one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bukavu, the roads are so poor and cratered that a visitor can get carsick 
just winding in from the airport. Top speed: 15 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 In Goma, an open sewer is cut right through town. It does not flow but is 
periodically shoveled out into stinking heaps a few feet away from food 
vendors. Human bodies are pulled out here and there and trucked away. 
Electricity is unreliable, the water runs through pipes only a few minutes 
every few days. Hospitals hold three to a bed. The land onto which the refugees 
are herded is sharp, volcanic rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone who has crossed the border a few times asks: "Wait a minute, 
which country was just ripped asunder by war?" 
</P>
<P>
 The contradictions hardly stop there. In the turbulent politics of Africa's 
ethnic strife, the winners got the land. But the losing regime still maintains 
control over perhaps two-thirds of the population, now displaced and fearful. 
And an army that still controls the people is not yet defeated. So in a large 
sense, the Rwandan civil war is not over. This is perhaps only a lull. 
</P>
<P>
 What about those for whom the world has offered its sympathies -- the 
suffering in the camps, the orphaned army of children? Among these refugees are 
also soldiers, youthful militia, neighbors and community leaders, farmers and 
hillside herders; a significant number of these folk engaged in one of the most 
brutal slaughters of recent years: perhaps 500,000 people hacked and beaten to 
death because they belonged to a different tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have sat many times at the table with their leaders and I've known that 
among them were killers. It's very strange," said Col. Erik de Stabenrath of 
the French marines. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority Hutus, losers and refugees, have been described, physically, as 
being shorter and possessing heavy features. The Tutsis, the minority in Rwanda 
and the winners right now, have been described as taller and with sharper 
features. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, the physical differences are so subtle as to be known only to those 
schooled in African tribal distinctions. It is not something so simple as the 
color of skin that breeds hatred and mistrust here in this part of Africa now. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the contrary is true. The Hutus are protected in this zone by mostly 
white troops from France. The onetime colonialists are almost revered. French 
flags fly from even the simplest of huts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trying to get the French out, the Rwandan Hutus connive to keep 
them here. 
</P>
<P>
 But the French vow to pull out this month and leave the Hutus behind a shield 
of U.N. troops drawn from other African nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Sammy Adorkor commands a company of Ghanaian soldiers, which is taking 
over one large sector of the French zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time we came, we heard they (the Hutus) didn't have confidence in the 
U.N. and the soldiers of Ghana, that they would leave if the French left," he 
said. "We are making intensive efforts with our patrols and contacts with the 
refugees here to convince them we will provide absolute security." 
</P>
<P>
 Will his word suffice? French Capt. Sylvian Mattivicci said he could only 
hope: "We are powerless against panic. With the U.N., there will be more troops 
protecting this zone than ever before. Food is coming. There are more medical 
supplies and doctors than ever. Will the people give that up for death, illness 
and no more guarantees of security?" 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Cyangugu, thousands of refugees have already made up their minds. They 
are leaving Rwanda. And while the French protect them, they are pillaging 
everything that can be carried -- doors, beams, windows, toilet seats, pipes, 
electric wire, their neighbors' laundry, stray chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 All day long, they go back and forth across the border like a line of leaf 
ants. They are destroying this town to rebuild across the border, seeking not 
so much a new life as another chapter in the old. If they can keep control, 
they will plan their vengeance, sustaining themselves through their misery on a 
raw diet of hatred. And they will plot their eventual counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 They have a model: The Tutsis did the same thing a generation ago. They fled 
Rwanda, gained strength and determination. And look what happened. How to Help

PHOTO ALBUM MAY REUNITE FAMILIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Aid officials trying to find relatives for orphans and displaced Rwandan 
refugee children are hoping a huge photo album will help. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. agreed Thursday to donate 600 rolls of film and process 
photographs of up to 10,000 orphans or children separated from their parents 
during the flight from Rwanda, a U.N. aid official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Children's Fund plans to compile the photos in a book that will be 
available to parents or relatives searching for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many children too young or too traumatized to give any 
information," said Christian Clark, a UNICEF spokesman. "Photos may be the only 
way to reunite people."

<P>
 -- Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-N.Y.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us not be a helpless giant in response to the demands and the concerns of

SUIT TO BAR LISTING OF ROSE LAW FIRM CLIENTS DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by Hillary Rodham Clinton's former law 
firm that would have prevented federal regulators from obtaining a list of all 
of the firm's clients since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Henry Woods signed the order Wednesday in the Rose Law 
Firm's suit against the Resolution Trust Corp. and the RTC Office of Inspector 
General.The order was released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC and its inspector general are investigating a conflict-of-interest 
question surrounding work the law firm did for the RTC, and is trying to learn 
whether Rose overcharged the government for work in that same S&L cleanup case. 
</P>
<P>
 In a suit filed April 26, Rose contended that a subpoena it received was 
"grossly overbroad" and would violate clients' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods dismissed the suit on technical grounds, saying that although the law 
firm "was understandably disturbed by the scope of the subpoena," he accepted 
the government's argument that the suit was premature. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has said complying with the subpoena could involve millions of pages 
of documents, in addition to the more than 60,000 pages the firm already has 
supplied to investigators.

COURT GRANTS REPRIEVE TO BLACK DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court turned Louisiana's election process upside down yet 
again Thursday, restoring -- at least temporarily -- a second majority-black 
congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court granted an emergency request by the state and the Justice 
Department to block new congressional districts imposed by a lower court. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields (D-La.) called the Supreme Court's action "a great step 
in the right direction for voting rights across America." 
</P>
<P>
 Fields was most affected by the court-drawn plan, which had eliminated his 
mostly black district. The Supreme Court's order restored the district and said 
it can be used for this year's election while the high court considers the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower court had thrown out a district that resembled a diagonal wedge 
across the state, ruling that it was unconstitutional because it was "racially 
gerrymandered." 
</P>
<P>
 The court then imposed its own Louisiana map. It drew seven neat districts 
along geographic lines, creating six mostly white districts while keeping one 
mostly black district in the New Orleans area. 
</P>
<P>
 The granting of a stay is an indication that the Supreme Court will decide 
whether to keep districts drawn to give blacks a majority and increase their 
chances of getting election. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Carolina last week, a different panel of three federal judges upheld 
a congressional district that looks like a long, meandering worm.

HOUSE VOTES TO APPROVE SOCIAL SECURITY TRANSFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to insulate Social Security from partisan politics and restore the 
public's waning confidence in the troubled New Deal program, the House voted 
Thursday to make the agency independent. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, approved by a vote of 431 to 0, also will force thousands of 
drug addicts and alcoholics off Social Security's disability rolls with no 
guarantee of treatment and end unsupervised cash payments to as many as 250,000 
substance abusers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill goes to President Clinton, who is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers believe that separating Social Security from the Health and Human 
Services Department will strengthen its leadership, insulate the $325-billion 
domestic program from partisan politics and rebuild faith in a retirement 
system that, if not changed, will run out of money by 2029. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Security will become independent March 31, 1995, and will be run by a 
commissioner and overseen by a seven-member bipartisan advisory board. The 
commissioner will serve for six years and can be removed only for wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also will be allowed to take its budget request directly to 
Congress, without first having to send it through the White House Office of 
Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, the agency lost a fifth of its staff at a time when growing 
numbers of Americans were seeking disability benefits. Rep. Andrew Jacobs Jr. 
(D-Ind.) says it now lacks the necessary resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Some taxpayers, as a result, have been inconvenienced by busy signals on the 
agency's phones and long waits for help in its network of 1,300 field offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have suffered severe hardship, including ill and injured workers who 
lost their homes, went on welfare, or died while waiting for their disability 
claims to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Security's disability programs also have been hit with allegations of 
fraud and abuse by an exploding number of immigrants, drug addicts, alcoholics 
and disabled children on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation tightens up the rules for substance abusers, limiting their 
cash benefits to 36 months. The clock would not start ticking for substance 
abusers who had worked and paid into the Social Security trust funds until they 
had entered treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But for addicts who hadn't paid into trust funds and collected Supplemental 
Security Income -- a welfare program for the low-income disabled and elderly -- 
benefits would run out after 36 months regardless of whether they had received 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional investigators have found that some addicts have used their 
monthly checks to drink and drug themselves to death at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are expected to save taxpayers $808 million over five years.

PROPERTY RIGHTS ENSURED IN NEW SPECIES PROTECTION POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Interior Department, hoping to defuse some of the criticism of the 
Endangered Species Act, assured landowners Thursday their property won't be 
placed at further risk if they agree to a formal species protection plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he hoped the new policy will show that 
the federal law protecting endangered animal and plant species is flexible and 
should be supported. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has been debating whether to drastically rewrite the law, arguing 
that too often it protects species at the severe economic and social expense of 
human beings. The law has also become the focus of a campaign to protect 
property rights against government intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Department announced a new policy that any private party or group 
agreeing to protect endangered species through a Habitat Conservation Plan will 
be assured no additional property will be taken or costs incurred through the 
life of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're telling landowners that a deal is a deal," Babbitt said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been a strong proponent of dealing with endangered species issues by 
entering into agreements with private parties for broad protection of a species 
habitat, instead of protecting species individually wherever they are found. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has been negotiating more than 130 so-called Habitat 
Conservation Plans around the country. Often a stumbling block in negotiations 
is the fear that the government will make new demands if the species continues 
in danger -- after an agreement has been made, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will affect the habitat of the California gnatcatcher and other species. 
Coastal sage scrub, the songbird's habitat, is found in Orange, Los Angeles, 
San Bernardino, San Diego and Riverside counties. Some development projects 
have been delayed for years because they would encroach on the bird's habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of Wildlife, a national conservation organization that has proposed 
both legal improvements and economic incentives under the Endangered Species 
Act, voiced strong concerns about the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders President Rodger Schlickeisen said, "We understand the desire of 
developers to reach binding agreements on species protection, and the need to 
cautiously test new approaches. At the same time, however, if we give 
developers long-term deals on species' plans, then we should also give wildlife 
an extra margin of error." He warned that "because conservation biology is not 
yet an exact science, it is wise to be safe rather than sorry when drafting 
species plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Although environmental groups have not yet been briefed on the new habitat 
proposal, Defenders Wildlife Counsel William Snape found Thursday's policy 
announcement vague in several key respects. "Not only is it unclear what 
'extraordinary circumstances' will require future mitigation by developers, but 
the very nature of such 'mitigation,' and who will pay, is not yet defined," 
Snape said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders has been a leader in promoting economic incentives for private 
landowners under the U.S. Endangered Species Act through a recent report and 
congressional testimony. On July 27, senior representatives of the 
environmental community and the private sector met in Newport Beach to explore 
options for incorporating economic incentives into the California Endangered 
Species Act. The meeting, which was hosted by the Irvine Co. and jointly 
organized by Defenders of Wildlife and the National Audubon Society, was 
attended by various developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Department's new policy will provide legal assurance that the 
government will seek no additional land, or make any additional financial 
demands on the parties in the formal conservation plan for the life of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat Conservation Plan agreements can vary in length, but often run 20 to 
30 years, officials said. The agreement normally calls on private parties to 
set aside areas for protection. In return, the government will allow commercial 
development of other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 During the life of a Habitat Conservation Plan, Babbitt said, the government 
still will have available a variety of mitigation techniques to assure that a 
species is not irreparably harmed.

CANADIAN WOMAN FINDS CONDOM IN WALNUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canadian housewife opened a walnut and was shocked to find a condom inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I cracked one open for my son, I discovered a condom inside," Tracy 
Chalcraft of Chatham, Ontario, told the Canadian Press news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The supermarket where she bought the nuts gave her a $20 food voucher as 
compensation, but its manager was at a loss for an explanation of how the 
unused prophylactic got there. 
</P>
<P>
 The item apparently came from a nearby sex shop that sells walnuts with 
condoms as a novelty, and a prankster may have tossed one into the 
supermarket's bulk foods section.

CLINTON NAMES 3RD WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL; PRESIDENCY: ABNER J. MIKVA ASSUMES THE 
OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR POLICING ADMINISTRATION ETHICS AND TRYING TO CONTAIN 
DAMAGE OF WHITEWATER PROBE. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton Thursday appointed liberal federal judge and former Illinois 
congressman Abner J. Mikva to be his third White House counsel, plunging the 
respected 68-year-old jurist into a stew of ethical controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton called Mikva a "man of uncompromising integrity and judgment" who will 
assume a position of critical importance in the Administration, which is facing 
scrutiny not only over the handling of the Whitewater controversy but over the 
ethics of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikva replaces another gray eminence of capital law and politics, Lloyd N. 
Cutler, 76, who served in the White House post for six months after the clouded 
departure of Clinton's first counsel, Bernard Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikva is leaving a lifetime position as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia, to which he was appointed by former President 
Jimmy Carter in 1979. White House officials said that he would take his 
judicial retirement pay rather than a White House salary in compensation. His 
retirement benefits are roughly $150,000 a year; the White House counsel's job 
pays $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He is considered an unapologetic liberal on the bench as he was during his 
10-year tenure in the House, supporting abortion rights, gun control and the 
right of gays to serve in the military. He is an unwavering foe of the death 
penalty.  
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the appointment in a brief Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton said: 
"With his new post, Judge Mikva will have served his country now in all three 
branches of our national government. I expect that his broad experience, his 
deep understanding of our country, our people and our institutions will make 
him an extremely valuable member of the White House team." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikva, with a bow to Cutler, said: "I am aware that I have a very big pair of 
shoes to fill and that you are the most important client that a lawyer could 
ever dream of serving, Mr. President." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikva brings to a troubled White House decades of experience in partisan 
politics as well as 15 years of service on the most politically charged of the 
12 federal appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, said Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), a longtime friend and former 
roommate of Mikva's, the new White House lawyer "brings a sense of perspective. 
He has enough years on him -- like Lloyd Cutler -- to look at these things with 
some balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikva's political and judicial judgment will be tested early and often as he 
assumes overall responsibility for policing Administration ethics and trying to 
contain the damage of the Whitewater investigation into the Clintons' business 
dealings in Arkansas. His long friendships with conservatives and Republicans 
might serve the White House well as these partisan issues are played out. 
</P>
<P>
 He also will inherit an independent counsel investigation of Espy, whose 
acceptance of free travel to sporting and social events from two large 
agricultural concerns may have violated federal conflict-of-interest laws or 
ethics regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the independent counsel inquiry, Cutler has asked the Office of 
Government Ethics to determine whether Espy violated non-criminal ethics 
standards. Cutler on Thursday also issued an edict prohibiting Cabinet officers 
and other presidential appointees from accepting travel or lodging from 
companies doing business with their agencies, even if those gifts are 
reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler, who accepted a temporary appointment as counsel in April, will stay on 
until Mikva formally assumes his post on Oct. 1. The job does not require 
Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikva, the son of Ukrainian immigrants, got his start in politics in 1948 as a 
volunteer in the progressive campaigns of Illinois Democrats Paul Douglas for 
U.S. senator and Adlai Stevenson for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the 1948 campaign that Mikva heard the immortal words of a Chicago 
ward pol: "We don't want nobody nobody sent." 
</P>
<P>
 As recounted in a 1979 oral history of Chicago politics, Mikva walked into the 
8th Ward Regular Democratic Organization headquarters to enlist as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in and said I wanted to help," Mikva recalled. "Dead silence. 'Who 
sent you?' the committeeman said. I said, 'Nobody.' He said, 'We don't want 
nobody nobody sent.' Then he said, 'We ain't got no jobs.' I said, 'I don't 
want a job.' He said, 'We don't want nobody that don't want a job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating with honors from the University of Chicago Law School in 
1951, Mikva clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sherman Minton and practiced 
law in a small Chicago firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, Mikva won election to the Illinois House, where he served 10 years, 
earning a reputation as a feisty progressive independent, like his good friend 
and roommate, now-Sen. Simon. He taught and practiced law in Chicago and then 
came to Washington to represent Chicago's north side in Congress. He resigned 
in 1979 to take the federal court post and has served there continuously for 
nearly 15 years. Profile: Abner J. Mikva

HOUSE PANEL DEFENDS SPY SATELLITE AGENCY; INTELLIGENCE: MEMBERS ASSAIL SENATORS 
WHO SAID NATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE OFFICE HID THE SIZE AND EXPENSE OF ITS 
$310-MILLION COMPLEX IN VIRGINIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sharp break with their Senate counterparts, members of the House 
Intelligence Committee defended the nation's spy satellite agency Thursday 
against criticism that it hid the $310-million cost of a large new headquarters 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying Congress was kept informed of the National Reconnaissance Office 
project in Fairfax County, Va., the House members criticized senators who 
objected earlier this week to its size and expense. The House members said the 
Senate grandstanding had unfairly damaged the intelligence community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charges of CIA or NRO deception are absolutely erroneous," said Rep. Larry 
Combest of Texas, the committee's ranking Republican. "Some people need to do 
their homework if they're going to sit on these committees. They have to be 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. David E. Skaggs (D-Colo.) referred to the "glib and unreasonable 
accusations made by members of the other body," without specifically mentioning 
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Sen. John 
W. Warner (R-Va.), the panel's ranking minority member. The two held a news 
conference Monday to announce their surprise at the four-building complex, 
triggering front-page stories about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Combest said the House Intelligence Committee had "much information . . . 
through both documents and staff briefings." Because of the Senate complaints, 
he said, "The reputation of both the intelligence community and the Congress 
has been besmirched without cause." House members did join the Senate in taking 
the NRO officials to task for not specifically identifying the cost of the 
building complex, but instead including estimates in various documents. Rep. 
Norm Dicks (D-Wash.) reminded NRO Deputy Director Jimmie Hill that he warned 
him some time ago "to give us a line-item budget." 
</P>
<P>
 But criticism of the "other body" reached such a nasty point that Rep. Doug 
Bereuter (R-Neb.) asked CIA Director R. James Woolsey whether there had been 
any violation of classification laws by the Senate in releasing information on 
the project. NRO officials reassured him that all the Senate materials had been 
properly cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 The House members gave Woolsey a warm reception that contrasted with his 
appearance Wednesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he drew 
repeated criticisms. DeConcini, who has been feuding with the director over 
several issues, is said by some House members to have raised the NRO issue as a 
way to embarrass Woolsey. Combest on Thursday said the "building issue has been 
lowered to what amounts to a public cat fight." 
</P>
<P>
 A factor that may have contributed to the difference between the House and 
Senate reactions was the role of Martin C. Faga, who was NRO director from 1989 
to 1993 when plans were taking shape for the headquarters complex and who 
previously was on the House committee's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Some additional information about the project came out during Thursday's 
session. Woolsey and Roger Marsh, NRO's project manager, said the contracts on 
the complex were competitively awarded. Marsh also said aerospace giant 
Rockwell Corp. would not earn any fees for serving as a cover to hide NRO's 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey got a chance to explain why the NRO budget has remained steady in the 
post-Cold War period while other intelligence and defense agencies are taking 
cuts of 15% or more. "In the mid-90s we require some investment," Woolsey said, 
"but the savings will come later on." 
</P>
<P>
 NRO Director Jeffrey Harris apologized Thursday for not breaking out the costs 
of the building in the agency's operations budget.

MEMBERS LASH OUT AT AARP'S SUPPORT FOR HEALTH PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry members of the American Assn. of Retired Persons flooded the 
organization's switchboards across the country Thursday, ranting against its 
endorsement of health care reform measures advocated by the Senate and House 
majority leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all very emotionally upset, but they're all saying the same words," 
said John Warner, a spokesman for the AARP who fielded calls in the Long Beach 
office Thursday. "They say: 'I haven't been polled and you can't represent me.' 
I wonder if they're reading something." 
</P>
<P>
 The calls began Wednesday, shortly after the AARP's board of directors 
announced its support of the health care reform bills proposed by House 
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.). By 3 p.m. PDT Thursday, the Long Beach office alone had 
received more than 175 calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsement of the Mitchell and Gephardt plans by the huge senior citizens 
group was seen as a major boost for the two proposals. It was the first time 
that the group had thrown its weight behind any health care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Most callers said they were upset that the organization's board had endorsed 
the two plans without surveying its 33 million members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just being ramrodded down our throats. I've never been as riled up," 
said Lucette Worrel, 69, of Bay St. Louis, Miss., an AARP member for about 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my insurance to change," Worrel said. "Maybe that's selfish but, 
damn it, I feel I have earned the right to be selfish." 
</P>
<P>
 AARP spokesman Peter Ashkenaz said the organization's Washington headquarters 
had received hundreds of calls, virtually all from angry members. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests, however, seemed unlikely to change the board's firmly held 
position. Board President Eugene Lehrmann said Wednesday that "if either bill 
is defeated, health care reform will be dead for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner, whose office handles AARP activities in four states, said answering 
the calls was frustrating because callers were "too emotionally upset to engage 
in logical conversations." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got 33 million people there's going to be somebody upset no 
matter what you do," he said. "Those who call in are usually the people who are 
against something."

RIGHTS CHARGE FILED IN SLAYING OF JEWISH SCHOLAR; CRIME: YOUTH FACING THE 
FEDERAL CHARGE HAD BEEN ACQUITTED OF THE STABBING, WHICH TOOK PLACE AS RACIAL 
RIOTS BEGAN IN NEW YORK'S CROWN HEIGHTS SECTION.

<P>
 A teen-ager acquitted of killing a Jewish scholar during riots in the Crown 
Heights neighborhood in 1991 will be returned to New York to be retried, this 
time for violating the victim's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemrick Nelson, 18, appeared at a detention hearing Thursday at the U.S. 
Courthouse in Atlanta, where he now lives. 
</P>
<P>
 He was indicted in federal court in Brooklyn. A federal prosecutor from 
Brooklyn and an FBI agent were sent to Atlanta to take Nelson into custody, his 
lawyer, Tony Axam, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, the FBI and the Brooklyn federal prosecutor's 
office refused Thursday to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening of the case culminates months of lobbying by New York lawmakers 
-- including Brooklyn Dist. Atty. Charles Hynes, whose office lost the original 
case -- to have the Justice Department investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal charges are often sought when local authorities fail to produce 
convictions in high-profile cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson was accused of joining a gang of up to 30 youths who surrounded and 
killed Yankel Rosenbaum, an ultra-Orthodox Jew from Australia who was visiting 
Lubavitcher Jewish headquarters in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbing took place Aug. 19, 1991, as three days of racial rioting began 
in the Crown Heights neighborhood. The violence was set off by the death of a 
7-year-old black child, who was killed when he was struck by a car traveling in 
a motorcade of Lubavitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Nelson, who is black, had a bloody knife in his pocket when 
arrested and that he later confessed to the stabbing. By the time the case 
reached trial, Nelson denied committing the crime and claimed that police had 
planted the knife on him. He was found innocent in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Axam is representing Nelson on a charge of aggravated assault in connection 
with a razor attack on a fellow student at Shamrock High School in Atlanta. 
That case has not come to trial. The Atlanta Journal reported that Nelson's 
victim allegedly had claimed that Nelson bragged about stabbing Rosenbaum.

TUCKER'S CAREER BLOSSOMED DESPITE SCANDAL; BACKGROUND: HE WAS FIRED FROM D.A.'S 
OFFICE AND PLEADED NO CONTEST TO TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE. BUT THE SCION OF 
PROMINENT POLITICAL FAMILY WENT ON TO BECOME COMPTON'S YOUNGEST MAYOR AND TO 
WIN A BITTERLY CONTESTED CONGRESSIONAL RACE.

<P>
 If any one word can be applied to Walter R. Tucker III, the congressman from 
Compton who was indicted Thursday for bribery and income tax evasion, it would 
have to be resilient.  
</P>
<P>
 Not only did he survive a scandalous legal transgression that would have 
buried most -- he thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Tucker, a former prosecutor in the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office, was charged with tampering with the date on photographs he 
was using as evidence in a narcotics case in an effort to cover up his having 
withheld the evidence from the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, who was fired from his job, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges 
and spent three years on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of disappearing from sight, Tucker went on to win two high-profile 
political offices in quick succession. In April, 1991, Tucker beat out older, 
more politically experienced opponents to become the youngest mayor in 
Compton's history. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, he ran for Congress -- much to the dismay of many in Compton -- 
and won an even more steeply uphill Democratic primary race. He dodged constant 
attacks on his controversial past and beat out Lynn Dymally, the heir apparent 
to the seat long held by her father, Mervyn Dymally. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Tucker, the scion of a prominent political family, has held his own in 
the confrontational, all-elbows world of Compton politics. Handsome, articulate 
and well-educated -- two years at Princeton University, a bachelor's degree 
from USC, a law degree from Georgetown University -- the 37-year-old politician 
has cultivated fans and created enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 During the riots in 1992, he earned praise for his eloquent comments about 
social injustice and was attacked as an opportunist looking for media 
attention. "Television whore" was the term the retiring Mervyn Dymally used in 
the heat of the congressional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before he ran for mayor, Tucker became a nondenominational minister 
and often sprinkled his comments at council meetings with religious blessings 
and offers to pray for people. Today, he is a nondenominational associate 
minister at the Bread of Life Christian Center in Carson. Tucker voluntarily 
became an inactive lawyer in 1992, remaining in good standing with the State 
Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Robin, have two children, Walter Rayford IV (born in 1986) 
and Autumn Monet (born in 1988). Tucker listed his wife as an employee in the 
Compton city manager's office on the financial disclosure statement he filed 
with the city clerk in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, there has been no shortage of praise or acrimony heaped upon 
Tucker. Danny Bakewell, leader of the Brotherhood Crusade, a community 
organization, once said: "He represents a new breed of African American men." 
</P>
<P>
 And Bernice Woods, a Tucker critic and former Compton City Councilwoman, 
commenting two years ago on Tucker's surprising congressional primary victory, 
mused: "All I know is that the devil does reign sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to his critics, a chastened Tucker said in a 1992 interview that he 
had learned his lesson: "How many times did I have to relive that mistake I 
made six years ago? Experience has taught me that no matter how zealous you 
are, you cannot do things at the expense of the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday few people, critics or supporters, were talking about Tucker as 
he faced his newest legal and political problem. A call to the home of Tucker's 
mother was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker comes from something of a political dynasty that has been likened to 
the Kennedys writ small. The Tuckers have remained fixtures -- charismatic and 
checkered -- in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman's father, Walter R. Tucker Jr., was a respected dentist who 
served on Compton's school board and City Council and later as its mayor. A 
staunch supporter of the city as it wrestled with increasing poverty and gang 
violence, the elder Tucker died of cancer in 1990, midway through his third 
term as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman's mother, Martha, has suffered her own legal problems. A 
former teacher and entrepreneur, she was accused of defrauding eight clients of 
nearly $300,000 in a real estate scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Tucker, who has said she was "left holding the bag" in what she thought 
was a legitimate real estate deal, pleaded no contest to three counts of grand 
theft and was ordered to pay a fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker also has a younger brother, Kenneth, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor 
of Compton in 1993, as well as two sisters. The Tuckers still maintain an 
elegant, high-ceilinged house in Compton that draws all the family members back 
from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 The answering machine at that home Thursday greeted callers with the 
following: "Today's message is how beautiful are the feet of those who spread 
the gospel. Leave your message at the beep and God bless."

COMPTON GETTING A BAD RAP, RESIDENTS SAY; REACTION: TUCKER'S INDICTMENT IS THE 
CITY'S LATEST IMAGE PROBLEM. BUT MANY SAY OUTSIDERS MISS THE TOWN'S PROFOUND 
SENSE OF COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Robert Henderson said he was not shocked by reports that Rep. Walter R. Tucker 
III has been indicted on charges of taking bribes -- but, like most Compton 
residents, he complained that the city's always getting a bad rap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's really surprised. Seems like something's always happening here," 
said Henderson, a security guard in the Compton shopping plaza where Tucker, a 
Democrat, has his district office. 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of resignation and frustration was evident on street corners, in 
doughnut shops and in stores as somber city residents recounted the 
controversies that have beset their community lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a home video was aired nationally showing a Compton police officer 
beating a 17-year-old youth, stirring allegations of police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 And now this. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like Compton is always in the news. I don't even read it anymore," 
said Kevin Brown, who was born in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Gaines, whose family owns a barbershop, said he believes that Compton is 
being unfairly targeted by the media and the FBI, which sought the indictments 
against Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always look for the worst," Gaines said. "Where is Compton on the 
weather map? We get excluded from the regular stuff (in the media). But when 
something bad happens, here comes the news van." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Compton has become more noted for its shortcomings than its assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the state took over the city's school system after independent 
auditors found that mismanagement had placed the district $17.8 million in 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Several large civic projects, including an auto mall and a giant hotel, have 
run into problems because of bad management or bad luck -- spoiling city 
leaders' plans to make Compton a stopping point for consumers throughout the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 And 27% of the city's 91,400 residents live below the poverty level, nearly 
twice as high as the proportion of those living in poverty in Los Angeles 
County as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents say what outsiders don't see is the city's profound sense of 
community. Many of its tree-lined streets are still well-maintained and quiet; 
many of its businesses are still locally owned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say Compton is one of the worst cities around, but it's not a ghetto," 
Joyce Gaines said as she clipped a customer's hair at the family's barbershop 
on Compton Boulevard. "It's a community of families." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Cathy Chavis said she and her husband, a doctor, could have lived 
anywhere in the Los Angeles area. They picked Compton to set up their medical 
practice and to build their house, valued at about $1 million, because they 
liked the city and felt that they could make a difference there. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say to me, 'You live in Compton? Aren't you scared?' I've never had 
any problems here," she said. "I think the city just gets a bad rap." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, residents say, Compton's problems are no different than those of 
any other city in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think these things don't happen in Santa Monica?" said Monica Davis, 26, 
who lives on the Westside but works as a hairdresser on Rosecrans Avenue. "The 
authorities figure that the city is a high-crime area, so they just pick on 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Tucker, he's no different than most politicians, residents say.

 "Politics has a way of rubbing off on people," said Ronnie Goins, 40, an 
out-of-work carpenter who grew up with Tucker. "I've lost my faith in all 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 But other residents said Compton needs to take a hard look at itself in the 
wake of the controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have lost their way here," said Alisa Lee, 35, who has lived in the 
city for 20 years. "The devil is on the loose, and he picks on the weakest. We 
are just the weakest." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Eddie Gaines said he was frustrated with the way that Compton has 
been portrayed in the media, he would be disappointed if the allegations 
against Tucker -- who was elected to Congress in 1991 after serving as the 
youngest elected mayor of Compton -- prove true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear people saying all politicians are crooked," Gaines said. "He should be 
better than that because he is representing Compton. He is one of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Omar Bradley, who spent much of last week discussing the controversy 
over the videotaped police beating with the media, said the allegations against 
Tucker came at a bad time for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else?" Bradley said. "It is not a bright day for Compton. . . . It's 
always darkest before the dawn." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxcy Filer, who was on the Compton City Council for 15 years, said he is 
disappointed by the turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am somewhat disgusted because we all worked so hard for Compton," Filer 
said. "All these people here used to have big ideas about Compton. They were 
idealists. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are no more idealists."

SENATE REJECTS TAX FOR RETROFITTING BRIDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Senate rejected a bill Thursday to impose a 2-cent per gallon 
surcharge on gasoline to finance seismic retrofitting of state highway bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) failed on a 22-16 vote, five 
short of the two-thirds margin required for approval.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was intended to pay for seismic safety improvements that were 
found to be needed even before the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents said that Californians already are taxed too heavily and that other 
means of financing the bridge work should be found.

BUYER ENVISIONED A TREASURE TROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a blind auction of unclaimed storage items, bidders play a game of 
calculation and intuition. The object: to determine which room of sealed boxes 
and old suitcases will yield fabulous treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, Ed Zaharoff did not calculate very well. 
</P>
<P>
 After removing smaller items from his newly purchased 5-by-10-foot room at a 
Northridge storage facility, Zaharoff noticed fluid trickling out of one of 
three heavily wrapped boxes. Pulling back tarpaulins covering one of two 
steamer trunks and cutting away three layers of black plastic and silver duct 
tape, he was overwhelmed by an odor of rot. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to stereo equipment, housewares and silk clothing, police 
discovered that Zaharoff had purchased for $2,300 three badly decayed human 
bodies, painstakingly wrapped and surrounded by long-since shriveled room 
deodorizers and mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping maybe expensive art work or a nice antique piece under those 
tarps," Zaharoff said. "It turned out to be somebody's misfortune." 
</P>
<P>
 Zaharoff, 46, of Los Feliz, is only a part-time treasure hunter; he earns his 
living operating a forklift at a Ralph's distribution center. Wednesday was to 
be a day of scavenging and the U-Haul facility, with an 8:30 a.m. auction, was 
to be the first stop.  
</P>
<P>
 Flashlight in hand, Zaharoff bought a room for $150. 
</P>
<P>
 But Room 109, about the third room up for grabs, drew stiff competition from 
the other experienced scavengers. The experienced ones spotted the stereo 
components and tarps and hoped for hidden valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 After outbidding the rest and paying much more than he normally would, 
Zaharoff and a friend began loading smaller boxes into his van. Crates of 
glassware and clothes, he said, were carefully arranged to keep the blue and 
yellow tarps tightly sealed around the large upright boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 He noticed seeping fluid when he moved the first trunk to open it. But it was 
the horrific smell when he began unraveling its wrapping that made him call 
police, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the game -- you can work all day long for nothing," Zaharoff 
said, adding that U-Haul refunded his $2,300.

FIRM LOSES FIRST ROUND OF DISPUTE OVER 'POG' NAME; COURTS: COMPANY IS BARRED 
FROM USING NAME PENDING TRIAL. COPYRIGHT BATTLE IS BEING CLOSELY WATCHED BY 
MANUFACTURERS, RETAILERS IN MUSHROOMING MARKET FOR MILK CAPS IN CHILDREN'S 
GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Huntington Beach company was barred Thursday from using the word pog to 
market milk caps used in the wildly popular children's game -- at least until a 
legal battle over the name goes to trial this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling was hailed as a victory by the Costa Mesa-based World POG 
Federation, which was sued by rival Universal Pogs Assn. Inc. But the case is 
far from over in the dispute involving the game played with decorated discs. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the ruling, Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Jane D. Myers 
ordered the World POG Federation to post a $350,000 bond by 4 p.m. today to 
compensate Universal Pogs for any business losses in the coming weeks if the 
company's opponent prevails during the November trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But World POG Federation President Alan Rypinski said Thursday he is confident 
that his company, which claims exclusive rights to the name, will win the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coke, Kleenex, Q-Tip and Scrabble all faced similar challenges, and each of 
them successfully defended their trademark rights," Rypinski said in a release. 
"We will too. I guess it comes with the turf." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. Rosenstein, an attorney representing Universal Pogs, said that he 
was disappointed with the ruling and that the company will change its name for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he remains confident the company will prove the name pog is so 
commonly used that it should be fair game for anyone to use commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were faced with is overcoming the presumption that ( pog ) is not 
generic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal dispute between the Orange County companies began last month and is 
being watched closely by other manufacturers and retailers in a fast-growing 
industry that some have predicted could generate $1 billion this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 In its lawsuit, the Universal Pogs Assn. Inc. is disputing the World POG 
Federation's claims of exclusive rights to the name. The federation has 
countersued. The owner of Universal Pogs has vowed to take the battle to the 
U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The game itself is simple and played much like marbles, but with 
silver-dollar-sized plastic and cardboard milk caps, similar to the flat 
circles once used to seal glass milk bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Players hurl a heavier plastic disc known as a "slammer" or "kini" onto a 
stack of the cardboard caps. The trick is to flip the cardboard caps over by 
hitting them. Rules vary, with children playing for points or to keep the caps 
they successfully flip. Children also collect the discs, which are decorated 
with various logos, sayings, personalities and characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The game has its roots in the Great Depression, when a similar game of milk 
caps became popular among children. More recently, the game was revived in 
Hawaii when a teacher at an Oahu elementary school rounded up milk covers from 
a dairy and introduced the game to her students. A favorite cover of the 
children was from a dairy drink called POG, which stands for passion fruit, 
orange and guava. 
</P>
<P>
 Rypinski said he competed against others and in September, 1993, obtained all 
rights to the POG brand name from the Haleakala Dairy for the game, as well as 
the fruit drink.

FOREIGN POLICY TROUBLES BLOW THE WHISTLE ON ARGENTINE CHIEF; LATIN AMERICA: 
WHILE HE STILL GETS HIGH MARKS FOR ECONOMIC POLICIES, MENEM'S POPULARITY HAS 
PLUMMETED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As tens of thousands rallied outside Congress to condemn a deadly bombing at a 
Jewish community center here last month, a speaker announced the arrival of 
President Carlos Saul Menem. The rain-soaked air was suddenly filled with 
whistles -- the Argentine equivalent of boos and hisses. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently chastened by the unfriendly reception, Menem, who rarely misses a 
chance to address a crowd, chose not to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombing, questions about the lax security that allowed it and doubts about 
the government's ability to investigate it are only the latest in a series of 
troubling challenges to Argentina's 62-year-old president. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem has watched his popularity plummet to its lowest level in two years, and 
the luster of his self-proclaimed "economic miracle" is beginning to show signs 
of tarnish. The timing is especially bad because Menem has just won permission 
to run for reelection, thanks to a new constitution that he spent months 
lobbying to have rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
 While he still gets high marks for economic policies that have spurred healthy 
growth and slowed runaway inflation, Menem has stumbled in recent weeks on 
foreign policy matters, giving the appearance that his government suffers from 
disorganization and internal discord. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to please Washington and move once-isolated Argentina from its tradition 
of nonalignment, Menem was quick to offer Argentine troops for a U.S.-led 
invasion of Haiti. Two days later, he retracted the offer amid protests from 
his own military as well as the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the July 18 Jewish center bombing, which killed nearly 100 
people, the president stated he would break off diplomatic relations with Iran 
if it is proven that Iranian diplomats assisted the terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diplomatic services and embassies are there to consolidate relations between 
countries and not to participate, if this turns out to be the case, . . . in 
this type of act," Menem told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a week later, Menem again backtracked. His government said Tuesday that 
even if the Iranian Embassy is implicated in the bombing, it would be unwise to 
rupture ties because Iran might retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
 And once the federal judge in charge of the case issued arrest warrants for 
four former Iranian diplomats, Menem said expulsion of the Iranian ambassador 
might be appropriate -- but not a break in diplomatic relations.  
</P>
<P>
 "His foreign policy is coherent in its objectives -- aligning Argentina with 
the West and the United States -- but it has been rather improvised in its 
execution," political analyst Rosendo Fraga said. The miscalculations extend to 
most areas of government except economic policy, Fraga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraga and other analysts add, however, that there is still time for Menem to 
recover before the presidential election next May, depending on actions he 
takes in the crucial months ahead and whether the Jewish bombing case is 
satisfactorily resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see him deepen his economic plan, but to improve his image he will have 
to come up with some novel things . . . (such as) a strong anti-corruption 
move, social action, initiatives on education or law and order, the things 
people care about," pollster Manuel Mora y Araujo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem's popularity dipped to a two-year low in a Gallup poll published late 
last month by La Nacion newspaper. It showed a 27% approval rating, down from 
50% last October. 
</P>
<P>
 October was a high point for Menem, analysts say. His party scored impressive 
victories in congressional balloting, and a confident Menem launched his 
campaign for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 To be able to succeed himself, Menem, a Peronist, had to have Argentina's 
141-year-old constitution amended. He struck a deal with the opposition Radical 
Civic Union, led by former President Raul Alfonsin; Alfonsin agreed to a 
reelection clause in the new constitution, in exchange for limits on 
presidential power. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem's good standing began to erode after that deal, which was reached in 
secret and accompanied by rumors of payoffs. Then the constituent assembly, 
convened May 25 to draft the new constitution, descended into near-violent 
debates and projected a rather negative image of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Riots last December in the province of Santiago del Estero and a massive 
protest rally outside the president's Casa Rosada last month underscored the 
weaknesses in Menem's much-vaunted economic program. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters in both cases complained that free-market reforms were widening 
the divide between rich and poor. Menem's program, under the direction of 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, has sustained 30% growth in the past three 
years and slashed inflation from 5,000% in 1989 to 7.4% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But figures released in July showed a record unemployment rate of 10.8%. The 
currency is overvalued, and Argentina's huge trade deficit soared even higher 
during the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Menem weathered allegations that linked his former wife's 
relatives to money-laundering for drug traffickers, a series of corruption 
scandals involving his party further dented public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In international affairs, Menem has been determined to end Argentina's 
isolation, epitomized when the South American nation declared war on Britain 
over the Falkland Islands in 1982. But his efforts to lock-step with Washington 
have meant at times turning aside the Latin American tradition of 
nonintervention. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haiti matter was particularly awkward. As a member of the U.N. Security 
Council, Argentina was the only Latin country to vote last month in favor of a 
resolution authorizing military force to restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 As he did in the Persian Gulf War, Menem offered to send troops. The United 
States followed the offer with an announcement that it was leasing a tank 
transport vessel to Argentina despite a British-inspired arms embargo. 
Officials in Buenos Aires and Washington denied the ship was a reward for 
Argentina's cooperation on Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But Menem apparently failed to calculate domestic opposition. Defense Minister 
Oscar Camilion publicly criticized the offer. And an opinion poll published in 
the newspaper Clarin showed 82.3% of the respondents were opposed to sending 
troops to Haiti. Only 14.4% were in favor.

FATHER OF ACCUSED KILLER OF CANDIDATE REFUSES TO TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The father of the man accused of assassinating a leading Mexican presidential 
candidate has refused to testify about his son in a Los Angeles court, making 
it unlikely that he will speak with investigators before the upcoming national 
elections in Mexico, if ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Aburto, appearing Wednesday before a special hearing in U.S. District 
Court, cited his right under Mexican law not to testify about a relative. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, Mario Aburto Martinez, a former Tijuana factory worker, is charged 
with the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential aspirant shot 
dead March 23 at a rally in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Aburto said he declined to testify because Mexican authorities have 
refused to let family members, independent lawyers and doctors visit his 
imprisoned son. The father also had called for the press and public to be 
present at the closed court session in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter A. Schey, the family's Los Angeles lawyer, accused Mexican officials of 
ignoring the requests in an effort to block the father's potentially explosive 
testimony. Mexican authorities said the requests were unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements of Aburto Sr., who lives in Los Angeles, were expected to yield 
indications of a conspiracy in Colosio's killing. In interviews, the father has 
said his son met before the assassination with as many as five men, who were 
later linked to Colosio's security detail for the fateful Tijuana rally. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. prosecutors convened the unusual court session to assist their Mexican 
counterparts. Mexican authorities posed questions through an assistant U.S. 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls have shown that Mexicans largely reject the government conclusion that a 
mentally unstable Aburto, harboring a hatred of Mexico's governing elite, acted 
alone in Colosio's killing.

MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS; EDUCATION: MORE THAN 600 TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS 
POISED FOR LEARN REFORMS GATHER AT PALISADES HIGH TO SEE AN EXHIBIT OF THE 
LATEST EDUCATIONAL TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Elementary schoolteacher Toni Flood held the rapt attention of a room full of 
her peers, raving about how a lesson plan with the unusual title of "Scottish 
Storyline" has all but worked miracles on her second- and third-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could literally see everything coming together for them," Flood said of her 
students' response to this new teaching tool. "They gained the power to 
research on their own. It wasn't just me telling them what to do. It was like 
things were leaping out of their books." 
</P>
<P>
 What Flood did to engage her students was use a hands-on teaching method she 
recently learned to turn her classroom into an imaginary travel agency. 
Planning trips requires knowledge of geography and map reading. And students 
must be able to write descriptive brochures and multiply big numbers to sell 
three $899 plane tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar experiences were touted time and time again this week when more than 
600 educators gathered in response to a rare invitation: Come see the best 
educational reform products in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In a first-of-its-kind event, Palisades High School was transformed into an 
educational shopping center for the parents, principals and teachers of 54 Los 
Angeles public schools that have been newly inducted into the district's LEARN 
reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 With financial backing from AT&T and the nonprofit Los Angeles Educational 
Partnership, leaders of 25 nationally recognized reform programs displayed 
their wares to Los Angeles school consumers in the market for ideas to help 
with the vexing problem of turning around troubled urban campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance for us to dream about what we could have at our school," 
said Don Watson, principal of Kittridge Street Elementary School in Van Nuys. 
"This is opening our eyes to all the possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Like shopping mall browsers intent on touching more than buying, the shoppers 
scooped up brochures and listened to promotional spiels on the latest trends in 
educational philosophies: from the joys of mixed-age classrooms to the 
importance of linking social services to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending Wednesday sampling the merchandise, some customers concluded 
that they cannot simply buy a quick-fix program off the shelf to improve 
student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have to do is come up with our own plan for improvement," said 
Michael Romero of 9th Street Elementary School, near Downtown's Skid Row. 
"Since no two schools are alike, no one program can work for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's thoughts -- echoed by other teachers and parents -- reflect the 
challenge of redefining education at schools within the cultural diversity of 
Los Angeles. The LEARN plan gives principals wide decision-making authority in 
their schools, on issues from budgeting to teaching methods. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, the so-called "stake holders" in a school -- including teachers, 
parents and other staff -- must learn how to work together to make plans, free 
from the bureaucratic rules and policies that for decades have dictated most 
every decision. 
</P>
<P>
 To get ready, the 54 schools involved in the second phase of LEARN -- Los 
Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now -- are in the midst of 
intensive monthlong training sessions conducted by education and business 
experts affiliated with UCLA. The goal is for schools to define for themselves 
the best educational program for students.  
</P>
<P>
 The workshops at Palisades reflected the changing needs of students, many of 
whom are poor and speak little or no English. Participants found there are 
programs that can remake an entire school or focus on overhauling an algebra 
curriculum or English department. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the concept of accelerated schools, a national project based on the 
theory that disadvantaged children need rigorous and challenging courses, not 
remedial education. There are also community learning centers, in which a 
single school can become a kindergarten through 12th grade campus so that the 
curriculum can be overhauled top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the old concept of afternoon field trips -- students can benefit from 
"guided discoveries" to Catalina for several days to learn about the many uses 
of marine algae. 
</P>
<P>
 One workshop advocated multi-age classroom groupings, where students in 
different grades study together to develop a sense of continuity and community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few if any adults spend their working day with others of the same age, so why 
should children?" asked Anne Browne of the Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School 
District, a leader in such innovations. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Judy Reilly of El Sereno Elementary School found the barrage of ideas 
a bit overwhelming. She is not sure she even understands exactly what she has 
gotten herself into by agreeing along with others at her school to participate 
in LEARN. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really aware yet what this is all going to mean," she said. "I know 
we have to change what we are doing because it's not working. I don't know if 
all this will work, but it's a chance and we have to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers union are 
wrestling over contract issues, with the threat of a strike looming next month, 
one teacher described the event as a badly needed "breath of fresh air" for 
their dispirited ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be innovative, we want to be cutting-edge and to do this we need 
to be exposed to ideas," said Dana Carter of Kittridge Elementary. "We still 
have to find ways to lift our morale. This is one way." 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for the new LEARN schools is to customize a plan of attack 
during the coming school year, using their newfound awareness of reform options 
already at work in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Craft, a parent whose son attends Crenshaw High School, said she was 
surprised to hear so many teachers express enthusiasm for their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This restores my confidence in education," Craft said. "I was all geared up 
to go to private school. But everyone here seems to be interested in finding 
ways to give our kids a better chance."

MAN IN OREGON SUSPECTED IN '93 KILLING OF OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man arrested on charges of murdering a woman during a robbery in Oregon has 
emerged as the prime suspect in the December, 1993, murder of Manhattan Beach 
Police Officer Martin Ganz, law enforcement officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are officially noncommittal about the suspect, Roger Hoan Brady, 
28, investigators who have spent eight months pursuing thousands of leads and 
tips in the Ganz murder are celebrating what they believe is a major break in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks like the one," said a detective close to the investigation who 
declined to be identified. "We went out and had a little celebration last 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, who served a term in federal prison for robbing an Agoura Hills savings 
and loan in 1989, reportedly resembles a composite drawing of Ganz's killer and 
was allegedly driving a gray 1988 Daihatsu during the Oregon robbery that 
matches the description of the car driven by Ganz's killer. Brady is being held 
without bail in the Washington County Jail near Portland on aggravated murder 
charges stemming from the Aug. 3 robbery of a supermarket in the Portland 
suburb of Cedar Mill and the shooting death of a 55-year-old woman outside the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 A .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol and a 7.62-millimeter SKS rifle seized 
after Brady's arrest have been examined by a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
weapons expert to see if either matches the Ganz murder weapon, Oregon police 
officials said. Officials would not reveal the results of those tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, 29, a Garden Grove native who joined the Manhattan Beach Police 
Department in 1989, was gunned down by a motorist he pulled over during a 
routine traffic stop near the Manhattan Village shopping mall Dec. 27. The 
killer opened fire as Ganz approached the car, then pursued the officer on foot 
as he retreated behind his patrol car. Ganz was wearing a bulletproof vest but 
was killed by a gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman then pointed his semiautomatic weapon at Ganz's 13-year-old nephew, 
who was on a "ride-along" in the patrol car, but he did not fire. The nephew 
and another witness described the killer as a dark-haired Asian or Filipino man 
in his late 20s or early 30s, driving a gray or silver hatchback auto. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington County sheriff's Cmdr. Rob Gordon said Brady, who is of Vietnamese 
and white ancestry, has been charged with killing Catalina Correa, a registered 
nurse who had gone to buy milk at a neighborhood supermarket and was shot in 
the back and heart by a man who had just held up a clerk in the store. She died 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness followed the gunman as he drove off in a gray Daihatsu until 
the gunman stopped and fired three shots at the witness with a rifle, hitting 
his van, Gordon said. The witness abandoned the chase but got the getaway car's 
license number. Police traced the car to an apartment in Vancouver, Wash., 
across the Columbia River from Portland, where Brady lived with his parents. 
Vancouver police surrounded the residence, and after several hours Brady 
surrendered. The pistol was found in the apartment, and Brady's father later 
turned over the rifle to police, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady waived extradition to Oregon and was arraigned on the aggravated murder 
charge Monday. Oregon officials say Brady almost certainly would have to answer 
to the Oregon murder charge before he could be returned to Los Angeles if he is 
charged with the Ganz murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal court and prison records show that Brady was arrested in October, 
1989, in the robbery of Home Federal Savings and Loan in Agoura Hills in which 
he pointed a pellet gun at a teller and got $2,053. Sheriff's deputies saw his 
getaway car and chased him to his home in the Topanga Canyon area, where he 
fled into the brushy hills. He was caught soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1990, Brady was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison with 
five years probation after his release. He also was ordered to undergo drug 
treatment, court records show. He was released from federal prison in Lompoc in 
October, 1992. In May, five months after the Ganz slaying, his probation file 
was transferred from Los Angeles to Vancouver, federal probation officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said a chance phone call tentatively connected Brady to the Ganz 
killing. Brady's federal probation officer in Vancouver mentioned the case to a 
friend in the Lennox sheriff's station, Gordon said. Ganz task force 
investigators contacted Oregon police and after hearing additional details 
"they got more and more interested," Gordon said. Four Ganz task force 
detectives and the weapons expert traveled to Oregon this week to follow up on 
the case, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach Police Chief Ted Mertens described his reaction to the Brady 
arrest as "cautious optimism." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pamela Ham, 29, Ganz's fiancee, said she is hoping the murder case 
has been solved, but knows the case is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still not over losing Martin yet," Ham said. "If this is the guy, it's 
the end of one chapter. But it's the beginning of another."

AUGUST BAKE-OFF; THERE'S NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY AND NO RELIEF IN SIGHT FROM 
NEAR-RECORD HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The sauna that is August in Southern California set in with a vengeance 
Thursday, baking the Downtown Los Angeles skyline in a haze of near-record heat 
and boosting temperatures in the valleys past the century mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In Van Nuys, it was 107 degrees by lunchtime, and by late afternoon, Newhall, 
Ontario, Burbank, Irvine Ranch, Woodland Hills, Monrovia, Pasadena, San 
Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu State Creek Park, Fallbrook and Riverside, among 
others, had all broken 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in the deserts, Palm Springs -- 116 degrees -- was shimmering like 
downtown Dharan. The state high was, of course, in Death Valley, which hit 121 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was steaming hot," reported 12-year-old Alicia Viramontes of Whittier, 
where the mercury was still hovering around 94 degrees as the dinner hour 
neared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to lay out and get a tan, but, like, every five minutes we had to 
jump back into the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the usually temperate coasts were wretched. Beach-goers seeking breezy 
respite up and down the Southern California coast were greeted instead with 
blasts of 90-degree-plus heat. Temperatures in balmy San Diego hit 86 degrees, 
breaking the second local heat record in two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty McKewon, a meteorologist for WeatherData, Inc., which supplies weather 
information to the Times, said the heat wave is due to a strong high pressure 
system that is expected to stick around at least through today. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, he said, is supposed to be over the Texas Panhandle this time of 
year, but instead has migrated westward. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are seeing is that the ridge of high pressure began to drift on 
Wednesday," McKewon said, "settling over the Four Corners area where Utah, New 
Mexico, Arizona and Colorado meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the system suppresses the downflow of air, it inhibits the formation 
of clouds, "allowing full solar heating over the Southern California area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the offshore airflow that normally moderates 
temperatures is almost nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's common in the summer to have a low pressure system over the deserts and 
this causes air to blow in from the ocean toward the lower pressure," McKewon 
said. "This cools off the coast and to a certain extent, the valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the air mass is basically stagnant right now. You're just getting intense 
heating." 
</P>
<P>
 The heat, McKewon says, probably will stick around for a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the hot weather to continue through the weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Civic Center -- which hit 97 degrees Thursday, one degree shy 
of a record set in 1879, will probably cool by a degree or two through the 
weekend, but not by much more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The valleys can expect highs from the low 90s to 100 degrees or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say we can expect temperatures to be lower by about three to five degrees 
. . . (in the valleys) on Friday and through the weekend," said McKewon, 
checking his computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the same for Monday and then it looks like we'll start getting back to 
seasonal temperatures around Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 The beaches, however, should begin to cool off over the weekend, with 
temperatures heading back down to the high 70s and low 80s, he said. Nighttime 
temperatures should also begin to get more comfortable along the coasts, he 
said, dropping from the sticky levels of recent nights to the low- to mid-60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, McKewon said, subtropical moisture associated with the high 
pressure system is expected to trigger thunderstorms today and through the 
weekend in the inland deserts, hitting first along the Arizona border and 
possibly spreading as far west as Palm Springs.

SAFETY VIOLATIONS CHARGED IN SUBWAY TUNNELING; INVESTIGATION: STATE AND FEDERAL 
OFFICIALS ISSUE A MAJOR CITATION AND UNCOVER 75 ALLEGED WORKPLACE HAZARDS 
DURING METRO RAIL CONSTRUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alarmed by two accidents within four months, state and federal occupational 
safety officials have begun an investigation of Metro Rail construction 
conditions -- uncovering dozens of alleged safety violations and issuing a 
major citation in one of the accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of two dozen state and federal inspectors fanned out earlier this week 
across Red Line tunnels and stations under construction. So far, investigators 
have found 75 alleged workplace hazards and forbidden the use of several pieces 
of heavy equipment, Cal/OSHA Director John Howard said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cal/OSHA has cited tunnel contractor Shea-Kiewit-Kenny in 
connection with a runaway train that injured three workers in March and 
temporarily shut down tunneling. In one of its largest assessments in the last 
two years, the agency ordered the company to pay $301,675 in penalties for 20 
safety violations, most of them classified as "willful" or "serious." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've only had seven (cases) in excess of $250,000" since June, 1992. "So 
this represents a fairly large package monetarily," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the company, which Howard said has appealed the citation, 
were not available for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalties and the emerging results of the investigation dealt another blow 
to a billion-dollar project beset by accidents and accusations of deficient 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely four months after the locomotive accident, three workers were injured 
in an explosion that rocked a tunnel beneath Vermont Avenue and 6th Street. 
Inspectors have found many sections of the concrete tunnels Downtown to be 
thinner than designed, and a misalignment of tunnels stretching between 
Downtown and Hollywood will require some re-excavation and push the project 
further behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The accidents prompted Cal/OSHA to mount the full safety audit sooner than the 
bimonthly routine inspection. And the agency invited federal inspectors to join 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned about some of these recent events," Howard said. "We 
accelerated this (investigation) a little, and certainly the scope is larger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a significant effort that we're making to audit the whole project, to 
make certain that the hazards that are present are corrected." 
</P>
<P>
 Electrical and ventilation hazards are among the 75 alleged safety violations 
discovered so far, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors have also ordered workers to stop using seven heavy cranes that may 
have faulty controls or wiring and have suspended excavation on at least one 
tunnel segment for lack of proper shoring. 
</P>
<P>
 A full report on the investigation is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials in charge of the project said 
they were unaware of the preliminary findings of the investigation and of the 
citation, issued Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward McSpedon, the MTA's executive officer for construction, said safety is 
a top priority on the project, which is to extend the Metro Rail system by 4.5 
miles along Vermont Avenue to Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Underground construction -- tunneling work -- has particularly high risks," 
he said. "Maintaining safety on our job site is a 24-hour-a-day, 
seven-day-a-week fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have safety requirements and provisions on the rail construction project 
that exceed substantially what you'll find on other construction projects," he 
said. "We have financial incentives and penalties on our large contracts to 
reward safe performance and penalize less-than-safe performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's award or penalty will be determined upon the completion of the 
project. McSpedon declined to comment on whether the MTA is happy with 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny's performance, saying only that the project's rate of serious 
injury "has been well below the national average." 
</P>
<P>
 Between October, 1991, and last May, the company has had nine injuries that 
kept people out of work the next day and 149 requiring medical treatment, 
according to the MTA. Those rates are about half the national average for such 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a Metro Rail safety official said in a letter to the company that the 
March 15 train accident was the latest example of "your ongoing unacceptable 
safety and quality performance on this project." 
</P>
<P>
 The citation issued in connection with the accident lists 20 violations, 
including 12 "serious" violations, four "willful (and) serious" violations, 
three general violations and one "willful regulatory" violation. 
</P>
<P>
 The willful violations, which imply that Shea-Kiewit-Kenny knew of the hazards 
but ignored them, carry the greatest financial penalty -- up to $70,000 in one 
case. Investigators accuse the contracting firm of failure to prevent employees 
from riding an improperly equipped train and failure to provide a brakeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors also noted that the company had failed to keep the track in good 
condition and to store oil-soaked waste properly.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HAWTHORNE; 5 TEEN-AGERS 
CHARGED IN SLAYING, STABBING AT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five teen-agers were charged Thursday with murder and attempted murder in 
connection with the slaying of one man and the stabbing of another at a party 
in Hawthorne.  
</P>
<P>
 Edward Willie Salazar, 18, of Redondo Beach and four youths ages 14 to 16, who 
were not identified because they are minors, were taken into custody after the 
attack early Tuesday.Salazar and one of the youths also were charged with the 
rape of a 17-year-old girl at the party, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Tim Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 A 34-year-old Hawthorne man, whose name has not been released, was killed, and 
Ronald Williams, 37, of Los Angeles, was critically wounded when they were 
stabbed repeatedly during a fight at a home in the 4600 block of 141st Street, 
said Sheriff's Lt. Joe Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was in critical condition with stab wounds to the upper body at a 
local hospital, Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators confiscated three kitchen knives and a screwdriver they believe 
were used in the crimes, Brown said. Officials said all the youths charged were 
suspected gang members.

<P>
 The San Pedro Service Processing Center has been named one of the nation's top 
detention facilities by the American Correctional Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In becoming the third U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service facility to 
receive the award, the San Pedro center received a perfect score in meeting the 
ACA's mandatory standards, and 99.13% in the non-mandatory standards, INS 
spokesman Rico Cabrera said. The study included a review of food service, 
training and lighting at the 450-bed facility.

EXPERTS SEARCH FOR CLUES TO IDENTITIES OF 3 BODIES FOUND AT STORAGE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER and ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forensic experts began the grisly task Thursday of trying to identify three 
corpses found decomposing in a rental unit at a Northridge storage facility, 
while police had few clues to determine who they are or how they got there. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators presume the victims were murdered, but fear that the trail of a 
killer may have grown cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies, which coroner's investigators tentatively identified as those of 
two men and a woman, were discovered Wednesday by police investigating 
complaints of a foul odor coming from a U-Haul company public storage room 
shortly after the room's contents had been sold at auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies had been rotting in two steamer trunks and a cardboard box for more 
than a year, authorities believe, and were so nearly liquefied that their race 
and age could not be determined. Some said the cause of death may never be 
known; autopsies could be performed as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is being treated, of course, as homicide," said Officer Rigo Romero, a Los 
Angeles Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Working through the night and into the day, police searched through the 
cluttered rental unit, filled with a nauseating stench, in the building in the 
18100 block of Parthenia Street. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they said, they have found no wallets or any other indications of who 
the corpses were or who placed them in the large trunks and the box and then 
wrapped them in black plastic sealed with silver duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 When they tried to track down the man who had last rented the storage unit, 
police said, they found a trail of fake identities, addresses and other useless 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things that we have found seem to be fictitious; addresses and those 
sorts of things," said Lt. Al Moen of the robbery-homicide division. "We don't 
have anticipation of any arrests any time soon." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, authorities said, they hope to solve the mystery by determining the 
identities of the corpses, perhaps through dental records, and interviewing 
their friends and associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were discovered after Ed Zaharoff of Los Feliz bought the contents 
of the abandoned storage unit sight unseen for $2,300 at an auction Wednesday 
and began removing the items. "I was hoping maybe expensive artwork or a nice 
antique piece," Zaharoff said. But, alarmed by the smell coming from one of the 
trunks, he called police. 
</P>
<P>
 After patrol officers found what appeared to be human remains in one trunk, 
the other trunk and the box were shipped to the Los Angeles County coroner's 
office, where they were opened and found to also contain bodies, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said there is little they can do until they receive the results of the 
autopsies. But they cautioned that the bodies are in such an advanced state of 
decomposition that it may be impossible to obtain fingerprints, although teeth 
and dental work should have survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaharoff said U-Haul refunded his $2,300.

<P>
 The total value of taxable property countywide increased by just 1.3%, to $497 
billion, for the fiscal 1994-95 tax year, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Income from property taxes is critical to just about all levels of government 
in California because most take a share of the tax proceeds. Under Proposition 
13, real property is taxed at a base rate of 1% of its value. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall's wildfires and the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake took a combined 
$600 million in property values off the county's tax rolls, Hahn said. The 
wildfires accounted for about $100 million of the decline and the earthquake, 
$500 million. Hahn said the full impact of the earthquake may not be registered 
for another year, and the eventual bill should hit about $1 billion in reduced 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest impact on the tax rolls, however, is the continuing recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Property reappraisals to reflect declining real estate prices wiped about $5.8 
billion from existing property values, the assessor said. About $5 billion of 
that figure resulted from reappraisals of commercial, industrial and apartment 
buildings. The remainder was from single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the total value of taxable property increased overall because of the 2% 
inflationary adjustment, which is applied to properties that are carried on the 
tax rolls at a value less than their market value. 
</P>
<P>
 Another measure of the troubled economy was reflected in the assessor's count 
of foreclosures. The number of property transfers during the year because of 
foreclosures climbed by to 29,698 from 19,162 the previous year.

KING ORDERED TO PAY $237,958 TO L.A. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Times wire services

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge ordered Rodney G. King on Thursday to pay $237,958 in legal 
fees for frivolously naming the Los Angeles Unified School District in the 
civil suit over his beating by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the trial, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies had dropped the country's 
second-largest school district from the complaint, which King brought against 
the city and police officers present during the 1991 videotaped beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Two school district police officers were present when King was beaten in Lake 
View Terrace on March 3, 1991, but they did not participate in the beating of 
King.  
</P>
<P>
 A jury ruled that the city owed King $3.8 million in damages as a result of 
the beating, but also ruled that none of the four officers involved were 
required to pay punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash-strapped school district, which is at odds with its teachers over 
salary cuts, filed a motion to recover its legal costs on the grounds that its 
part in the suit lacked merit and was frivolous, said attorney Rickey Ivie, who 
represents the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie said King's lawyers refused to drop the district as a defendant until 
earlier this year when Davies ruled in the district's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to hearings and motions over a three- to four-year period because 
they never agreed to release us," Ivie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never any evidence -- in fact all the evidence was to the contrary 
-- that the school district or its personnel ever had any contact with Mr. 
King," Ivie said Thursday after the motion was granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Lerman, King's attorney, did not return a phone call seeking comment.

ESTATE DIVIDES FAMILIES OF 2 QUAKE VICTIMS; LITIGATION: COUPLE DIED WHEN 
SHERMAN OAKS HOUSE COLLAPSED. NOW SURVIVORS HAVE FILED A FLURRY OF LAWSUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They lived with all the usual fast-lane L.A. trappings -- jobs in "the 
industry," a hillside house with stunning views, luxury cars, no marriage 
certificate. Then they lost everything, including their lives, when the house 
slid downhill in the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the deaths of Marc Yobs and Karen Osterholt have given rise to another 
part of the lifestyle: an avalanche of litigation, including a posthumous 
palimony complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt's family is suing Yobs' relations for a share of his estate, 
including the collapsed Sherman Oaks house, some quake-damaged antiques and his 
$300,000 life insurance policy. Both sets of relatives are pursuing separate 
suits against the sellers of the home on Sherwood Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal evidence is expected to include coroner's reports on the couple's Jan. 
17 deaths because Osterholt was the sole beneficiary of Yobs' life insurance 
policy -- but only if she survived him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a dispute -- and this is kind of gruesome," said attorney Jane 
Grilliot, "over whether they died simultaneously or who lived longer." 
</P>
<P>
 If Osterholt died first or at the same time, the policy's $300,000 proceeds 
would become part of his estate, to be claimed by his relatives. But if Yobs 
died first, the suit contends, the insurance money would then be hers, to be 
parceled out to her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Grilliot, who represents Osterholt's estate against the house's sellers, said 
she could not comment further on the rift. And lawyers for the rival estates 
also refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to court documents and other sources, the palimony dispute arose 
in the months after the couple's families buried them side by side, when 
Osterholt's parents received none of Yobs' life insurance settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt and Yobs, both San Fernando Valley natives, were working in the 
entertainment industry when they died. Osterholt, 30, had recently begun 
working as a receptionist at Mark Goodson Productions after a longtime job 
waiting tables. Yobs, 32, had just been promoted to assistant general manager 
of the Post Group, a film production company where he began as a film library 
clerk and worked his way up over 6 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a suit filed May 4 in Los Angeles Superior Court, Osterholt's mother, 
Eileen Waldrop, who is also administrator of Osterholt's estate, alleged that 
the Prudential Life Insurance Co. of America ignored the estate's claims and 
wrongfully gave the insurance money to the Yobs family, in part because Yobs' 
mother is a Prudential employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit notes that under state law, when an insured person and the only named 
beneficiary die together, insurance proceeds revert to the insured's estate. 
But the suit contends that there is medical evidence that Osterholt survived in 
the ruins longer, making her estate eligible to get the money. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Osterholt's relatives, Robert S. Waldo, would not elaborate on 
the court record. Similarly, a lawyer representing the Yobs family, Martin C. 
Bobak of Los Angeles, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yobs' older brother, Dave, challenged the suit's central claim that 
Osterholt lived longer, saying it is based on a review of coroner's reports by 
a privately retained physician. No autopsies were performed on Yobs or 
Osterholt, Dave Yobs said, adding that the suit has been a blow to his grieving 
parents, Margaret and Henry. 
</P>
<P>
 Yobs of Woodland Hills also challenged a second suit filed last month that 
demands a share of his brother's estate for Osterholt's survivors, contending 
that Osterholt sacrificed her interests to help support Yobs' career. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they began living together, the suit says, Osterholt "continued to work 
as a waitress, giving up opportunities for education and opportunities to 
advance in a career . . . to devote her entire skills, efforts, labors, and 
earnings, to maintaining the household for (Yobs)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agree Osterholt never held title to the house, purchased in 
February, 1992, for $400,000. But the palimony suit says the two "cohabitants" 
of nearly eight years had an oral agreement to share everything equally. In an 
interview, Grilliot said: "We do know that funds from both parties were used to 
purchase the house. We're still trying to figure out how much each 
contributed." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really irritated that (the suit says) she was entitled to half of his 
house," said Dave Yobs, a real estate agent who represented his brother in the 
sale. "Her income wasn't used to help qualify for (the house). My brother 
bought it as a single man. The title was very specific on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Yobs also disagreed with the length of time that his brother -- 
memorialized in the credits of the action film "Speed" -- had lived with 
Osterholt, saying the pair had an on-again, off-again relationship until Yobs 
bought the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt's parents, Waldrop and Gerold Osterholt, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate legal actions, both families are suing the attorney and his 
business partners who sold the house to Yobs, contending they suppressed a 
crucial engineering report warning of structural flaws in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the twin wrongful death and fraud suits charge, a prospective buyer 
named James Malmberg backed out after receiving the unfavorable report from an 
engineer. The defendants switched escrow companies and real estate agents "and 
anyone who knew about the report" before selling the house to Yobs, said 
Alexander Robertson IV, the Yobs family's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants also set up two dummy corporations -- Properties Du Monde Inc. 
and Danat Investment -- to hold title to the house and insulate themselves from 
responsibility for the damaging engineering report, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits name as defendants attorney and real estate investor Lawrence R. 
Gordon; his alleged partner and contractor Richard Robinson and Robinson's wife 
Margarette; Properties Du Monde Inc.; the Danat Investment Co.; and two more 
alleged business partners of Gordon's, Daniel J. Eget and Nathan J. Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Reese and Eget could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said he knew nothing about the matter, but acknowledged that it may have 
been one of his business interests handled by his lawyers and accountants. 
</P>
<P>
 Eget said: "I think when the facts come out, it'll be known that as far as 
Danat, myself and Reese are concerned, we are not a part of this deal."

DANA PARSONS: THE COUNCILMAN WHOSE COURAGE SET HIM UP FOR PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funny how a picture stays with you. When I think of Bob Gentry's public life 
in Orange County, what comes to mind is a 1989 newspaper photo of him taken 
shortly after his longtime male companion died of AIDS. Gentry, then the mayor 
of Laguna Beach, was photographed holding his companion's teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
 What an odd photo to let someone take, I thought then. He's just setting 
himself up for ridicule . 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after meeting Gentry and talking to him a few times over the years 
did I come to understand that the photo was, indeed, worth a thousand words. On 
the surface, it seemed only to capture the sensitivity of the man. I came to 
realize it also captured his courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as now, Gentry refused to sell out. He refused to conceal grief when he 
felt grief. And even though he had long ago announced that he is gay, he also 
refused to play down that fact when the most significant person in his life had 
just died. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry, now 55, announced this week that he won't run for reelection in 
November to the Laguna Beach City Council. He's wrapping up his third four-year 
term as councilman and sometime mayor and says he needs to devote himself to 
rebuilding two homes destroyed by last year's fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, it's not big news when a councilman from a town of 25,000 steps 
down. But as the county's first openly gay elected official, Gentry's imminent 
passing from the scene is worth at least one blast from the trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry was living on Skyline Drive in 1979 when he petitioned the city to save 
two 100-year-old pine trees next to his house that were imperiled by new 
development. After his successful effort, he got involved in his neighborhood 
association and then politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was totally anonymous at the time," he said Thursday from his office at UC 
Irvine, where is associate dean of students. "I hadn't done a thing. I had 
voted, of course, and was a little intrigued with the cantankerousness of 
Laguna Beach politics, but other than that, I had no ambition, no interest at 
all in running for office." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1982, however, Gentry decided to run for council. During one of the 
Saturday morning strategy sessions at his home, one of his supporters -- most 
of whom were heterosexuals -- asked about the gay issue. "People kind of looked 
at each other, it was kind of awkward, and I just said, 'What do you mean, the 
gay issue? I am who I am, you let me handle it. I'm going to be totally open 
and honest with anyone who asks and we'll just go from there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He got elected but it wasn't until the next year -- on Mother's Day, 1983 -- 
Gentry said, that his feelings about publicly proclaiming his homosexuality 
crystallized. A Times reporter had interviewed Gentry and others for an article 
on being gay in Orange County. At the end of the interview, the reporter wanted 
to double-check the spelling of his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You mean use my name?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although his sexual orientation was known locally, "There was something about 
the L.A. Times, Sunday edition that just brought up in me all the fear I had 
been taught over the years -- that you really shouldn't talk about it -- and 
what I finally realized was that it was exactly what I should talk about -- 
that greatest fear is what I should talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised in suburban Boston in a very Victorian, very middle-class 
atmosphere, and I learned like everyone else that queers and homos were evil, 
awful sick people. I remember very vividly as a young teen-ager being convinced 
that I was the only one in the world, that no one else had the same feelings I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 During his public life, Gentry has been an advocate of AIDS education and 
prevention, in addition to backing gay-rights issues. But he has not been a 
one-note candidate and says he is most proud that he worked on a wide range of 
issues, most notably environmental. 
</P>
<P>
 But because Gentry never shied away from being gay, he has been a target. When 
AIDS claimed his companion, Gary Burdick, in 1989, Gentry got an anonymous card 
that read, "One down, one to go." 
</P>
<P>
 And although he says he's grown "philosophical" about personal attacks on him, 
the anti-gay rhetoric still bothers him. "It really does, because it's based on 
lack of information and education, and that's what's really frustrating about 
this for me. Most of the anti-gay stuff I've heard is a pack of lies. Criticize 
me for my politics, criticize me for my sloppy thinking or my behavior or what 
I do wrong, but not for who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a neat, ironic twist that Gentry probably will be remembered for just 
that -- who he is. Long after his efforts against off-shore drilling are 
forgotten, people should remember the dignified courage with which he fought 
battles, many of which we probably never heard about. 
</P>
<P>
 They're the kind of battles the Jackie Robinsons of the world fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Gentry knew right away what his openness represented. "Not until I 
was there," he said. "I went into this wet behind the ears. I didn't realize 
any of the ramifications of my being gay until I was sitting up on the dais and 
realized that I now was a community leader and needed to act like one."

BY THE TIME THEY GET TO WOODSTOCK . . .; CULTURE: 25TH-ANNIVERSARY REVIVAL OF 
THE MUSIC FESTIVAL DRAWS DIVERSE COUNTY RESIDENTS. 
</P>

 They are about as different as two people can be. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a management consultant in Mission Viejo who owns her own home, 
scuba-dives and commands a comfortable income. At 44, she sometimes reminisces 
about the hippie days of her youth while jetting around the world for business 
or pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a 26-year-old college student from Anaheim who baby-sits for extra cash 
and, until recently, had never been on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 For three days this weekend, however, the two will share a place and an 
expectation. The place: an 840-acre field in Saugerties, N.Y., where an 
estimated 250,000 music fans are gathering for the 25th anniversary of 
Woodstock, which begins today. The expectation: a good time and, who knows, 
perhaps even a meaningful experience.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to do something like this," said Victor Virgen, the 
Anaheim college student. "Something's just telling me to go, so I'm going. It's 
wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ann Bailey, the management consultant: "I'm going to be with friends and 
be outside and camp out and be dirty for three days and break out of the 
daily-ness of my life. I'm going to celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither attended the original Woodstock music festival, held in August of 
1969. In Virgen's case, the reason is obvious: He was 2 years old at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said she can't remember exactly why she didn't go to Woodstock. A 
19-year-old student at the University of Colorado in Boulder, she spent that 
summer in her hometown of Zanesville, Ohio, vacillating, she said, between her 
desire to join the counterculture and the pressure exerted by the more 
conservative expectations of her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Woodstock, she recalled, made up her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a turning point," she said of the event that became a cultural 
watershed. "It shocked everybody that so many people could come together in 
that kind of celebration. . . . It was the dropping away of rigidity and 
prejudice, the (ushering in of) open-mindedness and the ability to make 
decisions for ourselves rather than do what the government or our parents told 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey spent the next several years living the prototype hippie lifestyle. 
Never far from her backpack and sleeping bag, she vagabonded from coast to 
coast attending music festivals and sampling alternative culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she settled down, got married, got divorced, started a business. 
But she never forgot about Woodstock and all it had meant. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things it meant," Bailey said, "was openly caring about other 
people -- living your life as an open book. Part of Woodstock '94 is a reunion, 
not necessarily of the same people who were there but of people who have the 
same spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone believes that such a spirit will be present. Some critics have 
characterized the new Woodstock as an over-hyped, high-priced event that will 
lack the innocence and spontaneity of the original. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgen said that for most of his life, indeed, the spirit that Bailey 
describes has been elusive. Though he was too young to experience the original 
festival, he said, he grew up hearing about it from older friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt like I missed out," said the student, who sports a goatee, a 
ponytail and silver studs in his pierced ears. "It would have been cool to have 
been there; everybody got along with everybody, it was fun, everyone partied 
and had a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today everything has changed. People are uptight and worried about money." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither he nor Bailey harbor great expectations that the 1994 event will bear 
any strong outward resemblance to its famous predecessor. Where the earlier 
event was freewheeling and drug-filled, they said, this one is likely to be 
comparatively sober and subdued. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if even some of the original Woodstock spirit is present this weekend, 
attendees say, Woodstock '94 will have served an important purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is going to be out there to have fun," said Virgen, who will 
celebrate his 27th birthday at the festival on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey sees a potentially deeper meaning. "I don't think it will be as 
significant to people who don't go there," she said, "but for those who do, it 
will be a chance to pass the baton on to the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
 And what is the message to be delivered to the next generation? Easy, the 
former hippie said: "Just be joyful, and carry that into your daily lives."

SOME JOB: FIRED EVERY DAY; HUMAN CANNONBALL IS TOPS AMONG CIRCUS ACTS, BY A 
LONG SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even among co-workers who kiss lions, ride horseback upside down and 
somersault on the high wire, Jon Weiss is something of a spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hundred times a year, the 32-year-old Long Island native shimmies down 
the barrel of a huge cannon and waits for an audience countdown to catapult him 
across the Big Top to circus glory. Three, two, one, BOOM! 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss flies out of the cannon's mouth at speeds up to 65 m.p.h. About four 
seconds and 120 feet later, the durable veteran hits the safety net, does a 
forward half-somersault and bounces up to relieved applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet the Human Cannonball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the tradition of the cannon," Weiss said. "To think people still get 
shot out of a cannon, it's still amazing even to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss' bit of human rocketry -- which is the final act each day for the 
Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, playing at The Pond in Anaheim 
through Aug. 14 -- thrills crowds wherever he goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was awesome," said Gail Moore, 35, of Moreno Valley, who was at 
the circus this week with her three children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it the way he shot out and flew," said her son Travis, 8. "It was 
cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking cool in a daredevil costume while hurtling through midair is no 
accident, Weiss said. It takes lots of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, who joined the circus as a clown in 1982, trained for three months 
before ever crawling inside a cannon. Since 1987, he has been airborne more 
than 3,000 times, including one flight down New York City's 52nd Street for 
"The Late Show With David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all technique," said Weiss, who uses his hips and arms to adjust his 
trajectory during his performance. "I want to make sure I don't over-rotate and 
also make sure I'm not coming in straight as an arrow. Otherwise I'll skid on 
my face." 
</P>
<P>
 Before technique, however, you need to be the right body size and type. Only 
if you're small and sturdy can you dream of becoming a human projectile, said 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm built like a fireplug," said the 5-foot-6, 140-pound cannonballer. "You 
have to be compact. Six-foot-two, 190 pounds is way too big." 
</P>
<P>
 Before becoming cannon fodder, Weiss prepares the equipment and himself. 
Depending on the arena, Weiss calibrates the cannon to avoid wires and 
ceilings, and measures the distance and alignment to the net. Then he checks 
and rechecks the height and angle of the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to takeoff, Weiss also warms up by jumping rope or running in place. And 
finally, when he's nearly ready to slide down the cannon's throat, he dons 
special knee and back braces for extra support during his flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The force that propels Weiss from the cannon is five times that of gravity. 
Weiss described the sensation this way: "Picture yourself in a car parked in 
the center lane of an expressway, hit from behind by another car going 65 
m.p.h. Even though you are ready for the impact and you've locked every muscle 
in your body, it's still quite a jolt." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Weiss has sustained his share of injuries being a human 
cannonball. He sometimes has trouble with his neck and a shoulder. He has 
strained an Achilles tendon. And last year he broke his nose when his knee 
smacked into his head on a landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My nose has never been the same since," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said there have been a few deaths associated with the art of flinging a 
human body so far so fast since it began in the late 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't like to talk about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does his wife, Laura, 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I'm worried that he could get killed," she said. "It's a very 
dangerous job, but I have faith in what he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather see him in a suit and tie," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 But in spite of her reservations, Laura still pulls the switch that fires her 
husband 11 stories across circus arenas nationwide. The Human Cannonball 
wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only person I can trust on the trigger is my wife," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who were married during a performance at Madison Square Garden in 
1986, are expecting their first child in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having a little cannonball," Weiss said. "Maybe when he or she is 19 or 
20 they can take my place."

LAWYER GUILTY OF INSURANCE SCAM FELONIES; COURTS: HE FACES PRISON AND LOSS OF 
LAW LICENSE. TWO OFFICE WORKERS ALSO CONVICTED IN CASE, BUT SANTA ANA DOCTOR IS 
ACQUITTED. 
</P>

<P>
 A Westminster attorney and two office employees were convicted Thursday on 
conspiracy and other charges in what authorities have described as one of the 
state's largest auto insurance fraud schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam involved "victims" seeking payouts for injuries they never suffered 
in auto accidents that never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio are among more than 35 people arrested in January, 1993, in 
connection with four loosely connected fraud rings in Orange and San Diego 
counties that authorities alleged bilked insurance companies with phony auto 
accident claims. A fourth defendant, a Santa Ana physician, was acquitted 
Thursday. Five other people previously were convicted in the case, while the 
remaining defendants face trial later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster attorney James Michael MacPhee grimaced and shook his head 
Thursday afternoon as an Orange County Superior Court jury found him guilty of 
four felony charges: two charges of conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, 
insurance fraud and attempted grand theft. He was acquitted of one count each 
of conspiracy and insurance fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 MacPhee faces a maximum sentence of more than six years in prison and could 
lose his license to practice law. 
</P>
<P>
 Law office employees Lam Hoang Luu and Phuong Thi Bich Vo also were convicted 
of one felony count of insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance 
fraud; Vo was additionally convicted of attempted grand theft. They each could 
face about five years in prison when sentenced Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this will send the message to law offices and others involved in 
fraudulent insurance claims they are no longer safe in those practices," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Chinn. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors acquitted a fourth defendant, physician Frank Lowe of Santa Ana, of 
conspiracy and insurance fraud charges.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were arrested following an 18-month investigation that targeted 
attorneys and doctors who officials alleged played critical roles in 
auto-insurance fraud schemes. Orange County law enforcement officers went 
undercover and claimed to be accident victims while several auto insurance 
firms also played along to help seal the arrests, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinn said the insurance companies did not lose any money during the 
undercover investigation because arrests were made before claims were paid out. 
But authorities estimate that fraud costs the auto insurance industry between 
$1.5 billion and $2 billion annually and drives up consumer insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of court, defense attorney Jeffrey N. Wilens said he believes MacPhee 
was "betrayed" by his co-workers, and said MacPhee was not knowingly involved 
in any fraudulent insurance schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 During the six-week trial, MacPhee testified that he took a 30% profit from 
insurance claims proceeds, while the remaining 70% went to two other employees 
who ran the law office. Chinn said that while such arrangements are legal, they 
can encourage dishonest workers to drum up profits by filing false insurance 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Dennis P. O'Connell, who represented Lowe, said he was disturbed that 
his client even had to go to trial when it was clear from the outset that 
evidence against him was weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury foreman Gerry Galleher said Lowe was acquitted because jurors did not 
believe he was aware of any insurance fraud scam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't believe he had anything to do with all this," Galleher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinn said he respected the jury's decision but said prosecutors would not 
have presented the case if they did not believe the doctor had knowledge of the 
scheme.

MERCURY CLIMBS AS HEAT IS ON; WEATHER: COUNTY RECORDS A HIGH OF 107 IN VAN 
NUYS. AND, THANKS TO A MISPLACED HIGH-PRESSURE SYSTEM, IT'S NOT COOLING OFF 
THIS WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 How hot was it? That line used to guarantee laughs when Ed McMahon delivered 
it to Johnny Carson in Burbank, but they're off the air now and nobody in the 
San Fernando, Santa Clarita or Antelope valleys found much mirth in the weather 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1 p.m. the temperature was already 107 degrees in Van Nuys and it stayed 
right there for almost three hours, according to Marty McKewon, a senior 
meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., which supplies weather information to The 
Times. That 107 was the official high for Los Angeles County on Thursday, but 
well short of the 121 degrees that made Death Valley the hottest spot in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Every official reporting station in the three local valleys recorded 
three-figure temperatures. In descending order: Woodland Hills hit 106, 
Lancaster and Newhall reached to 103, Palmdale hit 102 and Burbank got to an 
even 100. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not going to get much cooler anytime soon. "I'd say we can expect 
temperatures to be lower by about three to five degrees in the San Fernando 
Valley on Friday and through the weekend," said McKewon, checking his computer. 
"About the same, then, for Monday and then it looks like we'll start getting 
back to seasonal temperatures around Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if you don't have air conditioning, plan to spend a lot of 
this weekend at your local mall or supermarket, perhaps near the frozen goods 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 You can blame these temperatures on a high-pressure system that is supposed to 
be over the Texas Panhandle this time of year but instead has migrated, at 
least temporarily, westward. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are seeing is that the ridge of high pressure began to drift on 
Wednesday," McKewon said, "settling over the Four Corners area where Utah, New 
Mexico, Arizona and Colorado meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the system suppresses the downward flow of air, it inhibits the 
formation of clouds, "allowing full solar heating over the Southern California 
area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the offshore airflow that normally moderates 
temperatures is almost nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's common in the summer to have a low-pressure system over the deserts and 
this causes air to blow in from the ocean toward the lower pressure," McKewon 
said. "This cools off the coast and to a certain extent, the valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the air mass is basically stagnant right now. You're just getting intense 
heating." 
</P>
<P>
 If the temperatures do slightly dip as McKewon predicted, it will be thanks to 
an increase in that air flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Friday, Burbank will have a high of about 97 and then on Saturday and 
Sunday it will be about 95," McKewon said. "In Lancaster and Palmdale the high 
will be about 97 for the weekend days with possible isolated thunderstorms." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about sweltering Van Nuys? 
</P>
<P>
 "For Friday, we're looking at a high of 103 and then it will get to about 100 
on Saturday," he said.

TIME'S UP FOR DOCTOR IN FRAUD CASE; COURTS: AFTER CONVICTION 2 1/2 YEARS AGO, 
EX-VALLEY EYE SURGEON IS JAILED, DESPITE PLEAS AND PROTESTS THAT HE WASN'T 
READY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Time and the judge's patience ran out Thursday for a doctor convicted 2 1/2 
years ago of Medicare fraud who protested that he just wasn't ready to go to 
prison -- he had places to go, people to see, and besides, he left his car 
parked outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory however went to the prosecutor, who commented that prison is, by 
design, an inconvenient place to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alan R. Schankman, a former North Hollywood eye surgeon who has been free 
on $250,000 bail since he was convicted on 36 counts of grand theft in 1991, 
told Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stephen D. Peterson that he had not expected 
to be taken immediately to prison Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He was scheduled to testify in Glendale at another doctor's trial that 
afternoon, he said. His wife and four children were back in New York. And what 
would become of his car? 
</P>
<P>
 Schankman, who prosecutors say is suspected of overbilling Medicare by more 
than $1 million for phony eye operations, pleaded with Peterson to allow him to 
remain free on bond while he appealed his 16-month prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peterson said Schankman's time had run out: "I want to make it clear that 
if people deal fast and loose with the Medicare system, the day of reckoning 
surely will come." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait, wait, wait," the 46-year-old Schankman protested, pointing his index 
finger in the air. "It's just that, to go away now . . . I'm in the middle of 
things that have to be finished. I can't just stop in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert J. Schuit pointed out that going to prison is 
usually inconvenient for a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 It is meant to be, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schankman's protests continued, "Your honor, you know, what do I do with my 
car? I parked it on the street. I need some time with my attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can talk with them in the lockup," the judge responded. "I pronounced 
sentence over (two) years ago. It's time you served it. I wish you luck, Dr. 
Schankman." 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I get a drink of water?" Schankman finally asked. 
</P>
<P>
 A few seconds later, a bailiff ordered, "Put your hands down," and handcuffed 
Schankman. Outside, in the corridor, his tie and watch were removed, and he was 
led away.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual," defense attorney Harland W. Braun said, shaking his head. "The 
judge wouldn't let him put his affairs in order or get his car off the street, 
then smiled at him and wished him good luck. I think that's hypocrisy." 
</P>
<P>
 Schankman, a former Hidden Hills resident who has been living in New York, 
said in court he has sold his North Hollywood medical practice, which he said 
was ruined by the fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 During a six-week trial that ended in late 1991, Schuit contended that 
Schankman was "a thief in a white coat" who billed Medicare $1,600 for each of 
more than 30 eye operations he never performed. Though Schankman was prosecuted 
only for those phony billings, his total suspected Medicare thefts topped $1 
million, Schuit said. Schankman submitted claims for 687 operations between 
1987 and 1989, Schuit said.  
</P>
<P>
 Schuit said Schankman performed cataract operations on elderly Medicare 
patents, but left tight sutures in their eyes, which caused astigmatism. 
Several weeks later, he removed the sutures in his office, billing Medicare for 
a more complicated procedure called a "corneal wedge resection" to cure 
astigmatism.  
</P>
<P>
 The procedure, dubbed the "Schankman wedge" during the trial, is rarely 
performed, Schuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun contended during the trial that Schankman was the victim of his 
employees' sloppy billing procedures and murky government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the prison term, Schankman has been ordered to pay a $686,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 A complaint, filed against him on Sept. 20, 1993, is pending before the 
Medical Board of California. If it is upheld, Schankman's medical license could 
be suspended or revoked.

QUAKE-REPAIR CROOKS ROAM WEST VALLEY; CRIME: MEN OFFER DISCOUNTS TO FIX WALLS 
AND DRIVEWAYS, THEN DISAPPEAR AFTER BEING PAID HALF THE PRICE IN ADVANCE, 
POLICE SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two truckloads of men have been roaming the west San Fernando Valley offering 
discount prices to repair earthquake-damaged block walls and driveways, only to 
disappear after persuading homeowners to pay them half the costs up front, 
police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get the word out so more people don't get ripped off," said 
Sgt. Frank Mezquita of the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley 
Division, adding that homeowners have been conned out of thousands of dollars. 
"It seems like a lot of people let their guards down, and these people are 
taking them a block at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few days, Mezquita said, two crews have arrived in unmarked trucks 
and approached homeowners with an offer to make repairs for about half the 
normal cost. Repairing a six-foot block wall should cost about $15 per linear 
foot, according to building officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The men have told homeowners that a city building permit would not be needed 
-- even though it is -- and they have started working immediately, breaking up 
cement or tearing down remaining pieces of fallen block walls, Mezquita said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think they are getting a good deal, and the next thing you know they 
are getting ripped off," Mezquita said. "They get 50% (of the money) for the 
jobs and the people never see them again. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have trucks, they are dressed casually, and when they are asked about a 
contractor's license they try to avoid it by saying, 'You don't need a permit.' 
One guy seems to act like he doesn't speak much English." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they received about 30 calls within the last couple of days, with 
one Canoga Park man complaining that seven people on his block were taken in by 
the fraud. Mezquita would not identify the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the complaints have come from the West Valley, although police believe 
the men may also have struck in the East Valley and as far away as Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nobody being exempted from this," Mezquita said. "They're all getting 
hit. These guys are pretty smooth talkers." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Chafe, assistant regional deputy for the state Contractors' License 
Board's central region, which covers the San Fernando Valley, said he was not 
aware of the current scam, but added that several complaints have been filed 
about unlicensed contractors working in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Chafe said state law limits advance payments to contractors to $1,000 or 10% 
of the total bill, whichever is less. Hiring an unlicensed contractor is a big 
risk, he said, because "you just don't know if that person is going to show up 
after paying him some money." 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys have nothing to lose because they don't have a license to lose to 
begin with."

HIGH-STAKES POG BATTLE WILL BE SETTLED IN COURT; RULING: FOR NOW, A HUNTINGTON 
BEACH FIRM IS ORDERED TO CHANGE ITS NAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Huntington Beach company was barred Thursday from using the word "POG" to 
market milk caps related to the wildly popular children's game -- at least 
until a legal battle over the name goes to trial this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was hailed as a victory by the Costa Mesa-based World POG 
Federation, which was sued last month by rival Universal Pogs Assn. Inc. But 
the case is far from over in the high-stakes dispute involving the game played 
with decorated silver-dollar-size disks. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the ruling, Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Jane D. Myers 
ordered World POG Federation to post a $350,000 bond by 4 p.m. today. That 
money would compensate Universal Pogs for any business losses in the coming 
weeks if the company prevails during the November trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But World POG Federation President Alan Rypinski said Thursday he is confident 
his company, which claims exclusive rights to the name, will win the trial and 
said he believes the bond amount is excessive. His attorneys had suggested 
putting up $15,000, while Universal sought $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coke, Kleenex, Q-Tip and Scrabble all faced similar challenges, and each of 
them successfully defended their trademark rights," Rypinski said in a release. 
"We will, too. I guess it comes with the turf." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. Rosenstein, an attorney representing Universal Pogs, expressed 
disappointment with the ruling and said the company will change its name for 
the time being. The new name had not been determined Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein said he remains confident the company will prove the name POG is so 
commonly used that it should be fair game for anyone to use commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were faced with is overcoming the presumption that (POG) is not 
generic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal dispute between the Orange County companies began last month and is 
being watched closely by other manufacturers and retailers in a fast-growing 
industry some have predicted could generate a billion dollars this year alone. 
World POG Federation estimates 2 billion milk caps were sold in Hawaii alone 
over an 18-month period in late 1992 and early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In its suit, the Universal Pogs Assn. Inc. is disputing the World POG 
Federation's claims of exclusive rights to the name. The federation has 
countersued, seeking a permanent order barring Universal Pogs from using the 
name.  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Kaufenberg, the owner of Universal Pogs, has vowed to take the battle to 
the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The game itself is simple and played much like marbles, but with plastic and 
cardboard disks, similar to the flat circles once used to seal glass milk 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Players hurl a heavier plastic disk known as a "slammer" or "kini" onto a 
stack of the cardboard caps. The trick is to flip the caps over by hitting 
them. Rules vary, with children playing for points or to keep the caps they 
successfully flip. Children also collect the disks, which are decorated with 
various logos, sayings, personalities and characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The game has its roots in the Great Depression, when a similar game of milk 
caps became popular among children. More recently, the game was revived in 
Hawaii when a teacher at an Oahu elementary school rounded up milk covers from 
a dairy and introduced the game to her students. A favorite cover of the 
children was from a Haleakala Dairy drink called POG, which stands for passion 
fruit, orange and guava. 
</P>
<P>
 Rypinski, who developed the Armor-All brand of car-care goods, said he 
competed against others and obtained in September, 1993, all rights to the POG 
brand name from the Haleakala Dairy for the game, as well as the fruit drink.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; REPORT ON FIGHTING CRIME IS RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to neighborhood complaints, city officials announced a new 
long-range strategy to battle crime along Beach Boulevard in West Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The cornerstones of the strategy are policing more aggressively, offering 
constructive alternatives to youths, cleaning up the area and encouraging the 
formation of local neighborhood groups.The policy was made public Tuesday in an 
11-page report that refers to about 10 blocks along Beach Boulevard between 
Knott and Magnolia avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the severity of the area's problems has grown, so has the need to develop 
a long-term strategy to resolve these problems," City Manager James D. Ruth 
said in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy followed a July meeting between city officials and the Beach 
Boulevard Concerned Citizens Action Group about deteriorating conditions in the 
area. Group members complained about gangs, drug activity and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major police sweeps this summer resulted in more than 100 arrests for 
prostitution and drug violations in the area. Police have identified 12 street 
gangs that operate around Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the most important element to turning back crime would be community 
participation. The city soon will implement community-based policing and will 
lease a community resource center in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Other improvement measures include new lighting, street reconstruction along 
Lincoln and Crescent avenues, stepping up code enforcement efforts and 
encouraging young people to use libraries and athletic facilities. MARTIN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; CITY WEIGHS FUTURE OF FIRE SERVICE CONTRACT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted to ask the county whether the city can take its 
fire-protection tax money and shop for something other than the Orange County 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county agrees to relinquish the tax money, Villa Park will then explore 
the possibility of contracting with the nearby city of Orange Fire Department. 
Residents pay about $650,000 a year for county fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joseph S. Barsa said the council's 4-0 vote at a special meeting 
Wednesday night "authorizes us to explore (the tax situation) with the county." 
If the county agrees to give Villa Park its share of fire-tax money, Barsa 
said, the city can look for a new fire department. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the county turns down the request, Barsa added, Villa Park has no money 
to shop for alternate fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a no-go, everything else is dead," Barsa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision to try to get its county fire-protection money came as 
a majority of council members expressed disdain for a proposed new governing 
board for the county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park, along with 15 other cities in the county, currently contracts with 
the county Fire Department for service and protection. Villa Park's council has 
repeatedly emphasized that the city is happy with its current arrangement with 
the county.  
</P>
<P>
 But a majority on the council has predicted the city will be slapped with 
increased taxes in the future if the department becomes governed by a proposed 
new Joint Powers Authority, or JPA. Three council members -- Barsa, Councilman 
Bob Patchin and Mayor Barry L. Denes -- have criticized the JPA and said Villa 
Park should look for an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two council members, John Frackelton and Bob Bell, have been less 
critical of the JPA. Bell was out of state and unable to attend Wednesday 
night's meeting. Frackelton said he was voting with the council majority to ask 
the county to relinquish the city's fire- protection money, but he noted that 
the vote does not commit Villa Park to any action. 
</P>
<P>
 Frackelton said the fire-protection issue needs more discussion before the 
City Council acts on an alternative fire protection method. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over the JPA has become a hot issue in Villa Park. Several residents 
addressed the council meeting Wednesday night, some praising and some censuring 
the council majority.  
</P>
<P>
 "What has been manifested tonight is appalling to me," said David Parker. He 
accused some on the council, whom he did not identify, of having a "personal 
agenda" in opposing the JPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident, Jim Brodsky, urged the council to put the JPA issue to a 
vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Others supported the council majority in seeking an alternative to joining the 
new fire authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud you," said Kathy Moran. BILL BILLITER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; ORGANIZATION GIVES MINORITIES INTERNET ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 As the owner of a small nonprofit youth agency, Bee Hall knows firsthand how 
difficult it is to locate and obtain grants. 
</P>
<P>
 When she got started in business two years ago, searching for grants was a 
time-consuming and confusing process, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before Hall learned how to tap into Internet, a computerized 
information network allowing people from all walks of life to communicate by 
computer. The network is a bank of information for all kinds of subjects, 
including grants offered by government entities and private foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 But gaining access to this network is no small feat for many minority business 
people, who often lack the know-how to take advantage of computers, said Debra 
Santos, executive director of Pacoima-based Keeping the World at Peace Inc., a 
nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing computer technology to poor and 
minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Her organization offers access to computers that carry Internet. Computer 
training is also provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information age is creating tremendous wealth and business activity that 
is bypassing the poor and minorities," Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, who runs a nonprofit youth agency called Youth For Positive Attitudes, 
raised $5,000 in grants using Internet. "If you can write, then this system 
cannot discriminate against you," she said. "There is no visual on you, so you 
can join in as a partner on projects. . . . You are only judged based on your 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Internet started out as a government funded military project, Santos said. 
Colleges and universities began dialing into the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the universities got it, you had more access to information, so that 
people could talk to each other nationwide," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Internet also does marketing research, which helps would-be entrepreneurs draw 
up business plans to help them get loans, Santos said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can get the information you need to do a business plan in minutes, where 
it could take you months to research the data that you need to do a business 
plan," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use it ourselves for grant writing," she said. "We brought in about 
$400,000 in federal, state and private grants, using Internet and other 
personal networking." 
</P>
<P>
 Dannez Hunter of San Fernando has used Internet to help get funding for a 
documentary about Lewis Latimer, an African American who helped create the 
carbon filament used in Thomas Edison's light bulb. Using computers provided by 
Keeping the World at Peace, he raised more than $5,000, which has allowed him 
to get the film to the second stage of production, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hunter added, because the film, being produced by Creative 
African-American Productions, is expected to cost about $2 million to finish, 
the organization has to continue fund raising. It will use Internet to get in 
touch with people who may be interested in donating to the cause, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts caution, however, that Internet is not the solution for all 
minority entrepreneurs. Few businesses, for example, "actually do a sale or a 
transaction over the network," said Mark Lottor, owner of Network Wizards in 
Menlo Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit agencies and businesses must still use other methods to get ahead, 
including person-to-person contact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you still need to use your telephones and your fax machines," he added.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SALES OF SUBSIDIZED TOWNHOUSES SLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new townhouse complex built under a Glendale program for moderate-income, 
first-time home buyers is selling more slowly than expected, and city officials 
say they will reopen the application process in hopes of wooing interested 
purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hailed the Doran Villas project, at 423 W. Doran St., as an 
innovative public-private partnership when they approved the development two 
years ago.But so far, only one family has entered escrow on one of the 14 
townhouses in the complex since applications opened in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Families who meet the program's income requirements can receive a $35,000 city 
subsidy in the form of a "silent second trust deed" and below-market mortgage 
rates, but officials say the stagnant economy is discouraging many potential 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping for a greater response, but in this market it's probably not 
abnormal. People are more hesitant about purchasing," said Beth Stochl, 
supervisor of the program with the city's community development and housing 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 A family of four can have an annual total income of no more than $60,500 to 
qualify for the city's first-time buyer's assistance program, Stochl said. They 
must also be able to make a down payment of about 7% and pay the closing costs, 
which amounts to about $10,000 to $15,000 in upfront costs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some applicants to the program have been turned away because of poor credit or 
because they could not afford the monthly payments. Even with city subsidies, 
first-time buyers can expect to pay about $1,145 per month for one of the Doran 
Villas townhouses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A model unit is open for buyers to inspect, and the developer plans to hold 
several seminars for interested families. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on Doran Villas and the city's first-time buyer's program can be 
obtained by calling (818) 548-3936. STEVE RYFLE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COASTAL COMMISSION OKS CITY RESERVOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission has approved Newport Beach's application for 
a permit to construct a 3-million-gallon reservoir on the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one resident is crying foul because the project was started long 
before the permit was granted Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit allows the city to continue building the reservoir and add a 
5,950-square-foot building at the adjacent city utilities yard. The commission 
also allowed the city to lay part of 6.5 miles of 36-inch pipeline to Fountain 
Valley, where water can be pumped from wells and into the reservoir. The 
commission permit covers only 1.2 miles of pipeline because the rest is outside 
the coastal zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission vote was unanimous, even though some commissioners expressed 
concern about the city's starting the reservoir before the permit was issued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not up for holding up the project, but I am concerned that they didn't 
have a permit," Commissioner Linda Moulton-Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Louis Calcagno said if a private business had started work 
without a permit, it would be risking any chance of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time with that," he said before casting his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin J. Murphy said starting without a permit was an honest 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't any attempt to not comply with the Coastal Commission rules," he 
said. "We have built up a long relationship with the Coastal Commission and we 
don't want to jeopardize that." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said Newport Beach residents will pay less for water once the project 
is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The excavation at 949 W. 16th St., between the city yard and West Newport 
Oil's property, is already "about five stories deep and a football field 
across," said resident Dean Reinemann. 
</P>
<P>
 He complained to two commission officials Monday about the apparent violation 
of the California Coastal Act. 
</P>
<P>
 John Auyong, who evaluated the city's application for the commission and 
recommended conditional approval, said he was not aware the city had started 
the project without a permit until Monday and it became too late to recommend 
some kind of reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
 But a commission secretary confirmed that a sign from the commission posted 
outside the excavation on July 28 notified passersby that the permit was 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary also said the city submitted its application for the permit on 
Nov. 19. The application was reviewed on then turned over to the commission on 
July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the city made its application in November believing the pipeline 
was in the coastal zone but the reservoir was not. 
</P>
<P>
 City Utilities Manager Jeff Staneart said work began in January and the city 
did not realize its mistake until Reinemann complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Staneart said he checked his department's maps against those in the Planning 
Department and found a discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was stupid. I didn't know where the boundaries of the coastal zone were," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit was approved with conditions on preserving vegetation, limits on 
potential development and a requirement to bring in a Native American 
consultant if artifacts are found. HOLLY J. WAGNER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; COMPANY WILL DROP FREE GARBAGE PICKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no such thing as a free lunch -- or free trash collection.  
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management Inc., the company that collects litter from trash cans along 
the Ventura Boulevard business district in Sherman Oaks free of charge, 
announced it will no longer provide the service unless it is paid $1,200 a 
month for labor and pickup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Jones, operations manager for Waste Management, said that because the 
company's budget for this type of service is exhausted, it would have to charge 
for labor, hauling and disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the service has been provided gratis because it is a good cause and 
Waste Management prides itself on being a good corporate citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "the cost of service has become a burden." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to continue doing it but it's becoming extremely expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management is working with the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce to find 
a way to fund the service, which has been provided free since 1984. Topax, a 
trash collection company headquartered in Sun Valley, originally provided the 
free pickup along Ventura Boulevard until Waste Management bought out that 
company in June 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management has since collected trash from 40 bins in various spots along 
Ventura Boulevard between the San Diego Freeway and Laurel Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jeff Brain, chamber past president, the chamber is looking for 
other trash companies to take over the service as well as seeking donations 
from individual merchants in the area. The chamber is also asking the city to 
provide funds for pickup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber has asked Waste Management to give it until Sept. 1 to find the 
needed funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chamber members are even considering donating their own money for the 
service," said Brain. He added that the chamber may contact various radio 
stations to sponsor a pickup program in which a station would receive free 
advertising on the side of trash collection bins. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Cristol, chamber member and initiator of the trash pickup program in 
1984, believes Waste Management reneged on its responsibility to the community 
when it decided to discontinue the free trash collection.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's something known as corporate responsibility," said Cristol. "They 
(Waste Management) withdrew their former commitment to supply the service and 
pulled back on their commitment to the community. They carried the 
responsibility of contributing to a worthwhile project which kept our streets 
clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones agreed it is unfortunate Waste Management cannot continue to provide the 
service free. "We need some help to offset the labor costs. I agree it's a 
worthwhile cause. We did a lot of community work during the earthquake and it 
dissipated our funds."  
</P>
<P>
 "We (the chamber) appreciate the service Waste Management provided for the 
time they could," said Brain. "We'll move on and try to find some means to keep 
the program going. . . . We understand that situations change." ALICIA DOYLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; YOUTHS GET SOFTBALL LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even with a baseball strike, the Royals will be playing the Indians while the 
White Sox take on the Braves tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 But the players will not hail from Kansas City, Cleveland, Chicago or Atlanta, 
but from Sun Valley, North Hollywood, Pacoima and Tujunga in a new softball 
league starting at Sun Valley Park to give kids an alternative to gangs and the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea to form the league for 13- to 20-year-olds came from the kids 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had an opportunity like this before," said 19-year-old Susan Lopez, 
a member of the Youth Empowerment Committee, which has formed the co-ed 
softball league. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is a group of teen-agers brought together by the East Valley 
Partnership Community Council and the San Fernando Valley Partnership, which 
started the league with the help of the Sun Valley Park, Community Youth Gang 
Services and the Keeping Youth Doing Something program. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is made up of a wide range of kids, including student achievers 
who dream of being doctors, lawyers and police officers, as well as those who 
are at-risk or gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the players in this league of four, 15-member teams live in Sun 
Valley, but some come from throughout the East Valley, although they may have 
once lived here and still call it home. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the kids grew up together but went different ways," said Lopez, adding 
that forming the league has broken down old barriers between gang and non-gang 
kids. Membership on teams is not determined by neighborhood, clique or other 
affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all struggle the same and we all are coming together," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers who have formed this league have duly impressed the adults who 
have helped them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they have done it on their own," said Tom Hutchinson, recreation 
director at Sun Valley Park. "We're trying to show them we're not working 
against them but we're trying to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Kievman, executive director of Keeping Youth Doing Something, which runs 
softball leagues at other Valley parks, said that most of the work -- finding 
sponsors, organizing teams, etc. -- has been done by the kids, which she would 
ordinarily have to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing all the footwork really," she said. "They created it and I'm 
just stepping in to help." 
</P>
<P>
 A measure of the success of such softball programs is that gang or 
neighborhood affiliation does not become as important, Kievman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen it happen in other parks where the kids who have the team -- their 
membership becomes their identity," Kievman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The league is only funded to run for 10 months and will need more funding to 
continue every Friday night, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The league started with a $10,000 grant in federal funds acquired by the San 
Fernando Valley Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening ceremonies start at 5:30 p.m. followed by the softball games at 6 
p.m. Those who are interested in joining the league can call Paul Palato of the 
San Fernando Valley Partnership at (818) 837-7767, Ext. 312. ED BOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; INDEPENDENT HEARING DUE ON BINGO PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to hire an independent hearing officer to 
determine whether a nonprofit group that is under investigation by the state 
attorney general's office should be allowed to renew its permit to host bingo 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, which will cost the city $3,000 to $5,000, was scheduled after 
Amateur Sports Training Facilities appealed City Manager Raymond H. Kromer's 
refusal to renew its permit. The Fountain Valley-based organization raises 
money for athletes and athletic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for the hearing, said City Atty. Alan R. Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Kromer, in refusing to renew the group's permit, cited charges made by Atty. 
Gen. Daniel E. Lungren's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complaint filed in February, Lungren's office charged that the 
organization commingled its bingo proceeds with other funds in violation of 
state law. The attorney general also contends that the organization used bingo 
proceeds to pay salaries, also in violation of state bingo laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's attorney, Thomas E. Walley, acknowledged in a letter to 
Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi "that past improprieties have occurred" but added 
that Amateur Sports Training Facilities had "made adjustments as a result of 
the attorney general's investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Walley, in a telephone interview, said, "We've corrected everything that the 
state had a problem with." 
</P>
<P>
 State Auditor Paul Ng, who is investigating the case, charged that Amateur 
Sports Training Facilities paid salaries totaling $723,690 to 15 people who 
worked on bingo games in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The state audit also determined that of nearly $2.4 million in revenue, the 
organization donated only 11% to athletes and athletic organizations. Kromer 
noted that the donations of $262,720 were not much more than the $202,000 
salary of the organization's president, James Remmey. 
</P>
<P>
 "When combined with other salaries paid, it appears as though the dominant 
purpose (of the organization) was to pay substantial salaries to individuals, 
and not to help athletes," Kromer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Kromer charged that the salaries paid to certain individuals were "excessive, 
unfair and illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Walley said there are no laws regulating how much money must be donated to a 
charity. He added that in the past four years, the organization has donated 
more than $2 million to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization has been granted an annual city bingo permit since August, 
1989, when the first permit was issued. Bingo permits must be renewed by the 
city annually. Five other organizations in the city hold bingo permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Walley said the organization is continuing to hold bingo games until the 
hearing officer decides the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The city allows bingo games for charitable purposes. State law allows only 
certain nonprofit corporations to conduct bingo games. Only security personnel 
may be paid salaries from bingo game proceeds, which must be kept separate from 
other money that a group takes in. Bingo game profits must be used for 
charitable purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Walley said that as of March, the organization had complied with state and 
city bingo laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In the organization's application for an appeal, Walley charged that "there is 
no evidence that any bingo monies have paid any salaries in 1994" or that the 
organization has violated bingo game laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intent has always been to be in compliance," Walley said. DEBRA CANO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; WOMEN SOUGHT FOR TECHNICAL CLASSES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Community College is using about $50,000 in state grants to help 
unskilled women compete for entry-level technical jobs traditionally held by 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's adult re-entry center is offering financial and other assistance 
to women interested in entering a one-year training program for electrical 
assembly, blueprint reading, computer repair, computer-aided drafting, 
soldering, aviation structural design and other fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course men will be in these classes too, but we're trying to recruit women 
in these areas because they're traditionally male-dominated," said Jan Swinton, 
the college's coordinator of special populations. She said the program exposes 
women to "a little bit of everything" in the technical trades, so they can 
qualify for entry-level manufacturing jobs with a view to advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has 20 openings funded through the state Job Training Partnership 
Act, plus additional spots covered by other grants. Women who qualify can get 
help with counseling, registration, tuition, books, transportation, child care, 
tutoring and job placement. 
</P>
<P>
 An orientation for interested women will be held at 10:30 a.m. Aug. 19 in Room 
TC107 on the college campus, 1500 N. Verdugo Road. STEVE RYFLE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; LEANING PINE TREE THE FOCUS OF DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A downtown bank wants to remove a tall pine tree that is leaning steeply over 
its rooftop, but city officials who take tree preservation seriously are not so 
sure the conifer should end up in someone's fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen years ago, the same debate made its way to the City Council, with a 
different bank asking unsuccessfully for permission to chop down the same pine, 
citing potential safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a major victory for the community to preserve large trees," said 
City Councilwoman Carolyn Nash, who favors keeping the angular pine alive. "We 
don't want a manicured, plastic community." 
</P>
<P>
 The big 50-year-old tree is rooted in a city right-of-way in front of the 
Great Western Bank at Del Obispo Street and Camino Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other council members said they do not oppose the pine's remaining if it 
is not in danger of falling over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be careful that we don't put public safety second," Councilman Gil 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to decide the tree's fate at staff level this time, City 
Manager George Scarborough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarborough said the city plans to hire two arborists for expert opinions, 
after one hired by Great Western Bank said last month that the tree could 
topple if hit by high winds and heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's at about a 21-degree angle," said Bob Nesbitt, an arborist from Orange 
hired by the bank. "We generally frown upon leaners." 
</P>
<P>
 Nesbitt said he didn't know if some of the tree's roots were cut during 
road-widening work more than a decade ago on Del Obispo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A towering, thick eucalyptus next to the pine stands straight. 
</P>
<P>
 John Tomakin, a bank spokesman, said the pine presents a danger to pedestrians 
and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nash said the pine has always been at an angle, and its preservation was a 
condition of city approval for the development that houses the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash said local activists halted bulldozers when bringing the issue to the 
city's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's tree ordinance requires a permit to remove any tree more than three 
inches in diameter and six inches above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is so serious about the pine that sheriff's deputies were asked to 
keep an eye out Aug. 3 for any bank-hired tree crews that might have begun work 
at dawn under the mistaken notion that the conifer could go. 
</P>
<P>
 William Huber, the city's director of building and engineering, said the 
deputies were enlisted only because other city staff members weren't available 
to check on the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber said opinions from other arborists will help the city decide what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trained, to be honest, in trees," he said. "We only administer the 
program." JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COASTAL PANEL OKS RESTAURANT ON PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to build a Ruby's Surf City Diner at the pier's end received California 
Coastal Commission approval Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Piers are near and dear to us," said Doug Cavanaugh, co-founder and president 
of The Ruby Restaurant Group, which will lease the building from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will complete the link between Seal Beach Pier and Balboa Pier." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Ruby's Diner opened in December, 1982, at the end of Balboa Pier. Of 
the 18 Southern California Ruby's Diners, 13 are in Orange County, including 
restaurants on Balboa and Seal Beach piers. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to begin early next year with opening targeted for 
June, Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission approved a 45-foot high, two-story, 6,510-square-foot 
restaurant, which will be octagon-shaped with a red tile roof. Cavanaugh said 
the restaurant's interior will have a surfing theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to have a phenomenal view," Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal Commission staff previously had recommended that the restaurant height 
be a maximum of 35 feet, but agreed to 45 feet after meeting with city staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Hagan, Huntington Beach community services director, said that 45 feet is 
needed so plumbing and other equipment can be placed on the pier, rather than 
underneath the pier where it would be exposed to wave damage. The height also 
allows for screening of unsightly ventilation and other equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bernard, a board member of Huntington Beach Tomorrow, a citizens group, 
told the commission that the building height should be 35 feet to minimize 
negative effects on public views. 
</P>
<P>
 A snack shop and bait and tackle shop on the pier were also approved. A new 
lifeguard tower and restrooms on the pier have already been approved by the 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the cost to build all five buildings on the pier is estimated at 
nearly $2 million. But the city has only $1.3 million to construct the pier 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to build Ruby's alone is estimated at $1.2 million, he said. Ruby's 
will be built first since guaranteed income to the city from lease and tax 
revenue is estimated at $150,000 a year, Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the approved plan, Ruby's will validate tickets for customers who park 
in the city's downtown parking structure. DEBRA CANO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON CINEMA COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council has postponed a vote on a proposed cinema complex 
to give the developer time to redesign his project and make it less 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided to name a panel to work with John Kilroy to help him 
reduce the scale of the project, which opponents say is too large for 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's talk about square footage. Let's talk about master plans. I'm ready to 
talk about it," Kilroy told the council Wednesday after all the members said 
they would deny the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The council plans to review the project again in mid-September. That would 
allow time to name the panel to meet with Kilroy and for the panel to make 
recommendations to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The board was to vote Wednesday on whether to approve Kilroy's plans for an 
eight-screen theater complex that would be part of a planned 
1.5-million-square-foot office and retail park known as Calabasas Center. It 
would be located at the corner of Calabasas Road and Parkway Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has created a bitter split between backers who say the center 
would help the city by bringing in consumer dollars and foes who fear the 
project would ruin Calabasas' quality of life.  
</P>
<P>
 Some opponents pledged to recall any board member who voted for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too big, too much, too soon," said Mayor Karyn Foley. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said that a scaled-down version of the project would be an 
asset because it would give Calabasas residents a place to gather and a sense 
of community. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents worry that a 2,800-seat movie theater would increase crime in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The cinema controversy takes on added importance after a 1992 council decision 
to approve an eight-theater movie house near the corner of Las Virgenes and 
Agoura roads. That project, part of a 190,000-square-foot commercial center 
called the Calabasas Promenade, is about two miles down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer of that project says the city can't support two theater 
complexes, but a study ordered by the council suggests both theaters could 
compete because they would draw customers from different areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy said he has no objection to the naming of a panel as long as he gets to 
name some of the members. Councilman Dennis Washburn suggested naming City 
Manager Charles Cate, City Atty. Casey Vose and Councilman Marvin Lopata. 
Washburn suggested himself as an alternative. FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VAN NUYS; ACTIVIST KEEPS ON FUMING ABOUT SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Call him Mr. No Secondhand Smoke if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1970s when Herm Perlmutter was a college student, he asked a young 
woman to dinner in a fancy restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to be inundated with cigarette smoke," Perlmutter said. So he 
called ahead to the upscale Van Nuys eatery to find a time when he and the 
woman he had met at Cal State Northridge could enjoy a smoke-free, romantic 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me Monday, at 3 p.m.," he recalled, and when the couple arrived, 
they were seated in the middle of the main room of the restaurant. The host 
then proceeded to seat smokers in a circle around Perlmutter and his date. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the beginning of the war for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something snapped," he said, recalling how it was the fury he felt from this 
incident that spurred him to become a nonsmokers' rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Perlmutter is the associate executive director of the American Cancer 
Society San Fernando Valley Unit in Van Nuys, and can look back over almost 20 
years of a war fought against secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 His early efforts met with limited success. Right after graduating from 
college, he wrote and coordinated the first nonsmokers' rights initiative -- 
which would have required separate nonsmoking sections in restaurants, 
supermarkets and health care facilities. It went nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the measure never made it to the ballot, Perlmutter savored the 
victory of getting 250,000 signatures with a meager budget of $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 After he realized that he became ill when he was around cigarette smoke, 
Perlmutter in 1975 joined GASP (Group Against Smoking Pollution), a San 
Fernando Valley activist organization. 
</P>
<P>
 As he continued his activism through the American Lung Assn. and later the 
American Cancer Society, Perlmutter authored and lobbied for a number of 
anti-secondhand-smoke policies, watching as many of them were defeated through 
what he sees as underhanded tactics used by the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 During the final week of the 1980 campaign for Proposition 10 -- which would 
have required separate non-smoking sections in public places -- Perlmutter 
watched an anti-Proposition 10 television ad in which a police officer slapped 
handcuffs on a smoker at a sports event. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the ads were aired, the polls showed that the public was in favor of 
the proposition by 53%, but ultimately voted against it. "I still feel 
sickened," Perlmutter said. "They won by lying to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Perlmutter's current battle is focused on Proposition 188, which is sponsored 
by Philip Morris and would overturn the statewide law recently signed by Gov. 
Pete Wilson banning smoking in most public places. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; GRANT TO HELP ARTS INSTITUTE FOR TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to a $100,000 grant from the California Arts Project, Cal State 
Northridge will keep teaching teachers how to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-year state grant will enable CSUN to continue a program started in 
1990 to educate public school teachers in art instruction techniques.Serving 
five counties, CSUN is one of seven California Arts Project sites in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Each summer, CSUN holds a two-week arts institute in dance, theater, visual 
arts and music for about 40 public school teachers who represent a wide range 
of geographic areas and academic disciplines. Each year, the school reapplies 
for the grant to keep the project going. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing awareness that the arts are important," said Catherine 
Dezseran, director of the project at CSUN. "It's not only to teach art, but to 
embed it in the entire curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
 The CSUN site is supposed to serve about 50,000 public school teachers in Los 
Angeles, Kern, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. But 
Dezseran, who teaches theater at CSUN, acknowledges that the grant is just a 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way one site could reach all of those people," she said. "We'd 
have to keep doing this for hundreds of years." SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; CHILD-CARE CENTER AT SCHOOL FACES DELAYS

<P>
 It's been a rough road to child care at Monroe High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year after the school received a $68,000 grant to launch a day-care 
center for the children of teen-age mothers, the school has yet to receive the 
most important component of the project: a building. 
</P>
<P>
 Tangled in bureaucratic delays, a portable building that the school district 
bought from Long Beach Unified School District for $1 still sits at an 
elementary school there, slated for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 The districts agreed to the deal in March, but the move was stalled by a 
series of mix-ups in the permitting process necessary to haul the 22-foot-high 
building from Long Beach to the Monroe campus in North Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 Monroe Principal Joan Elam said she had hoped to have the center open by the 
fall to serve some of the estimated 140 teen-agers in the area who have 
children, about 45 of whom are enrolled at Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of kids with kids," Elam said. "This is a real need at Monroe. 
Hopefully we'll see a light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District hired a contractor to move the 
portable building, but the permits to transfer the building were not properly 
completed, according to Jim Samples, deputy director of maintenance for LAUSD. 
The building is blocking construction plans at the Long Beach school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were supposed to move it Monday night. Our people were ready to make the 
move," Samples said. "We're frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 When it finally opens, the child-care center at Monroe will serve about 50 
children ages 6 weeks to 5 years, as well as offer training classes for 
parents. The original grant for the center came from the YMCA, but Elam said 
she is trying to identify other funding sources. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she hopes that accommodating such young babies will encourage 
teen-age mothers to return to school sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could certainly improve our odds," she said. "If you start at 2 (years 
old), some may come back. But they get discouraged." SUSAN BYRNES

 The Calabasas City Council has approved spending $39,000 to replace a worn out 
water filter and plumbing system in the city's municipal pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, acting on Wednesday at the behest of City Manager Charles Cate, 
called the situation a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool, located at the Calabasas Tennis and Swim Center, was purchased by 
the city in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool was installed in the late 1970s, Cate said. FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: QUAKE PUSHES BACK USUAL SCHOOL REPAIRS

<P>
 Long before the Northridge earthquake saddled the school district with 
hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to about 160 campuses, schools 
needing exterior painting, roofing or plumbing repairs had to take a number and 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
 With a districtwide maintenance backlog of more than $600 million, delays for 
school repairs not deemed urgent often stretched for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with many of the Los Angeles Unified School District's maintenance 
workers dispatched for earthquake repairs, schools that had expected such 
projects to begin this summer are facing yet another round of delays. 
</P>
<P>
 At Strathern Street Elementary School in North Hollywood, for example, 
administrators who have waited years to have the school's exterior repainted 
from green to white with a teal trim, were set for the face lift to begin in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the earthquake, the $165,000 repainting job has been pushed back at 
least several more months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to shift some people," said Jim Samples, deputy director of 
maintenance for the district. "The earthquake threw us behind."

<P>
 According to Strathern's office manager, Kathy Low, who attended the school as 
a child, the dingy green exterior walls have never been fully repainted since 
the school was built in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating," Low said. "Here we are thinking how good the school is 
going to look." 
</P>
<P>
 Samples said the Strathern painting and several other projects slated to start 
in the spring or summer should begin within the new school year. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that although the earthquake tacked several months onto an already 
overwhelming wait for repairs, the real concern is the backlog itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to grow every year," Samples said. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SECURITY TIGHTENED AFTER BRAWLS IN JAIL 
</P>

 Activities have been slowed and security measures increased this week at the 
Central Men's Jail in Santa Ana because of two skirmishes Monday in which 
prisoners fought on a bus and in a cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said routine security-tightening procedures -- such 
as limiting the number of prisoners allowed in the cafeteria, on the roof for 
recreation or in substance abuse counseling sessions at any one time -- 
remained in place Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a lock-down," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate incidents Monday, groups of prisoners tangled and had to be 
restrained by guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The first fight began about 3:50 p.m. on a bus from Municipal Court in 
Fullerton and was ultimately stopped when jail personnel used pepper spray. 
About 7 p.m., a group of about 40 prisoners were fighting in a cell until 
deputies separated them. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen prisoners were treated for minor injuries in the second fight. JODI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; CITY INVESTIGATING LINCOLN AVE. HOTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has launched an investigation of hotels and motels on Lincoln Avenue 
to see if they are in conformity with health and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 One goal, city officials said, is to make sure the lodging places are not used 
as cheap apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are supposed to be hotels and motels -- not apartment houses," said 
Councilman Walter K. Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
 The council this week received an interim report from city staff about the 
Lincoln Avenue hotels and motels. City Planning Director Chris Eynon said in 
the written report several motels were found to have numerous fire and safety 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Her report said that one motel in the 6000 block of Lincoln Avenue had "few 
smoke detectors functioning" and had a "non-operational fire-support system." 
</P>
<P>
 Eynon's report also said the Police Department had found that some hotels and 
motels on Lincoln Avenue account for a large number of calls for disturbances 
and reported violation of drug and prostitution laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact there are so many police calls shows we have a major problem and 
that we'd better do something about it," Eynon told the council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed that the city staff should continue to crack down on 
code violations in the hotels and motels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to be very proactive if we want to resolve these problems," 
Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson said an updated report on the city staff's 
investigation will be received within the next 30 days. BILL BILLITER

County Cultural Pride Inc. A video illustrating Stonewall celebrations will be 
shown from 5 to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of gay artists will display their work at the Art Expo during the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 About 140 groups and organizations will set up booths to give information and 
display artwork. Singers, bands and comedians will perform from 2 to 10 p.m. 
both days. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's parade begins at noon Sunday. For the first time, participants 
will leave the festival grounds and march around the perimeter of the campus. 
The parade begins at Berkeley Avenue, turns left on Campus Drive and continues 
to Bridge Road.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; HIGH SCHOOL MAY BE CLOSED AT LUNCHTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of most Laguna Beach High School students, the district is 
leaning toward a plan to close the campus during lunchtime, the superintendent 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject was discussed at the Laguna Beach Unified School District meeting 
Tuesday night and should be back to the board for a decision on Aug. 23, 
Supt.Paul M. Possemato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discussion was rather lively, I'll say that," he said. "There seems to be 
a general point of view that there needs to be a closed campus. I think how to 
do it seems to the difficult issue for some board members." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is considering the option, Possemato said, out of concern for 
students' safety and in hopes of building student morale by encouraging more 
teens to attend lunchtime events on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities discussed so far include closing the campus for all youth, 
corralling only ninth- and 10th-grade students, closing the campus at the start 
of the school year and waiting until more noontime activities can be created to 
involve teens, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Possemato said parents received a questionnaire on the subject in June and 
fewer than 20% responded. Of the respondents, 60% favored the closed campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, when high school and incoming students were polled, between 80% 
and 90% responded and "a good 80%" rejected the idea, Possemato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overwhelmingly, the students are not supportive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Laguna Beach High School's 730 students, from 500 to 600 are likely to 
leave campus for lunch on any given day, Possemato said. LESLIE EARNEST

MOVER DRAINING PROPANE TANK IGNITES FIRE AT IRVINE APARTMENT; ACCIDENT: HE 
BREAKS HIS LEG ESCAPING THE BLAZE, WHICH DESTROYED THE CONTENTS OF THE 
RESIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mover attempting to drain a small propane tank on an apartment balcony 
Thursday inadvertently ignited a fire that destroyed the contents of the 
residence, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the propane gas erupted in flames, the mover, Brad Ansell, jumped from the 
balcony and broke his leg, according to Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansell, 32, of Redondo Beach, was treated for the broken leg at the scene by 
paramedics and then taken to the Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin. There 
were no other injuries, but the fire caused about $80,000 in damage to the 
second-floor apartment and its contents, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1:30 p.m., Ansell and his partner had just begun removing the belongings 
of Joe and Kelly Bien from the Windwood Knoll Apartments on Flagstone when 
Ansell discovered a five-gallon propane tank that was probably used in a gas 
grill, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansell told fire officials he took the tank out onto the balcony and began 
releasing the propane. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike natural gas, Young said, propane "is not some innocuous material. 
You can't just release it into the atmosphere. It is unlike natural gas in that 
it is not lighter than air. When you release it, it goes to the low point of 
the area and collects in pockets. . . . It will sit there for days. It doesn't 
just go away." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened next, Young said, was that the propane seeped into the Biens' 
apartment and within minutes entered the vents of a hot-water-heater closet, 
where it ignited. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of an explosion, Young said, when leaked propane gas ignites, "you get 
this huge whoosh." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters brought the blaze under control in less than half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the Biens' belongings were destroyed in the blaze, Young said. 
The second mover, Robert Wilson, was on the steps to the apartment when the 
fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Young urged anyone wishing to get rid of propane to "stop by any propane 
facility. Any company would be glad to take it."

KILLER-GANG MEMBER GETS 37 YEARS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Juan (Slash) Garcia is headed to state prison for 37 years to life for the 
January, 1992, execution-style slaying of a rival gang member in the parking 
lot of the Odyssey restaurant, a prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Superior Court Judge Meredith Taylor sentenced Garcia, 22, to the 
maximum sentence Thursday.Last month, a jury convicted Garcia of first-degree 
murder for shooting 17-year-old Martin Loziano, Deputy Dist. Atty. John 
Nantroup said.  
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Loziano and two companions were enjoying the view from the 
hilltop parking lot of the Granada Hills restaurant in the 15600 block of 
Odyssey Drive when Garcia and two other suspected gang members drove up. An 
argument broke out, which led to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nantroup said testimony showed that Loziano, already wounded, was hiding 
behind a palm tree when Garcia found him and fired the fatal shot into his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others were also injured. Tonya Marie Pineda, 18, was grazed by a bullet, 
and her brother-in-law, Daniel Pineda, 20, was shot through the thigh. Garcia 
also was convicted of assaulting Daniel Pineda with a firearm.

SUN VALLEY MAN, 33, ELECTROCUTES HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Sun Valley man apparently electrocuted himself by wandering into a puddle in 
his back yard while holding a lamp attached to an extension cord, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gearin, 33, died almost immediately after the incident, which occurred 
about 7:40 p.m. Wednesday at his home in the 11100 block of Allegheny Street, 
said Los Angeles Police Lt. Joseph Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearin, a contractor, was carrying a light mounted on the end of a metal 
tripod when he stepped into the water at the same time the cord touched the 
puddle, caused by garden watering earlier in the day. Although most electrical 
cords are waterproof or water resistant, the water got into the gap where the 
light cord was plugged into the extension cord, making contact with the 
electrical current, Garcia said, "and that completed the electrical contact 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was accidentally electrocuted." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said police have ruled out suicide, because Gearin was planning to meet 
his girlfriend later Wednesday night and had never talked of suicide, but an 
autopsy will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearin was found by a roommate who suffered a slight shock trying to save him, 
Garcia said. Gearin was pronounced dead at the scene.

PAIR PLEAD NOT GUILTY IN ROBBERIES; CRIME: JOSEPH GILLON IS ACCUSED OF HOLDING 
UP 31 FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS. HIS GIRLFRIEND ALLEGEDLY DROVE GETAWAY CAR SEVEN 
TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canoga Park man who told police he turned to stickups to pay his bills was 
arraigned Thursday on charges of robbing 31 fast-food restaurants since late 
May, most of them in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Gillon, 38, pleaded not guilty to the armed robbery charges in Van Nuys 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillon's live-in girlfriend, Tinnia Younger, 39, who was charged with driving 
the getaway car in seven of the robberies, also pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police say that during a three-month armed robbery spree, Gillon 
entered fast-food restaurants at night, wearing sunglasses and usually a 
striped shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 His approach was nearly identical each time. 
</P>
<P>
 During each robbery, Gillon allegedly threw a cloth bag on the restaurant's 
counter, and at gunpoint demanded that a clerk fill the bag with money, said 
Detective Mike Watson of the Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide 
Division, which investigated the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 After each robbery, police said, Gillon escaped in a 1985 Dodge Lancer, which 
had been parked around the corner from the restaurant and, in most cases, was 
driven by someone else. Gillon never fired the gun, and no one was hurt during 
the robberies, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the restaurants Gillon allegedly robbed were a Popeyes Famous Fried 
Chicken & Biscuits in Canoga Park, as well as outlets of McDonald's, Carl's 
Jr., Arby's, Jack-in-the-Box and Der Wienerschnitzel. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Gillon's alleged crimes were recorded on video surveillance cameras in 
several of the restaurants, Watson said that before this week he always managed 
to escape before police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the whole thing worked out pretty well . . . in-and-out in three or 
four minutes tops," said Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 But after it became apparent that the robberies were probably connected, 
police placed several restaurants in the West Valley under surveillance. Watson 
said Gillon also was being watched, but he would not say if police learned 
Gillon's identity through the surveillance camera images. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Watson said, two police officers saw Gillon's car parked around 
the corner from a fast-food place, and watched as the driver got out and 
covered the license plate with a rag -- a tactic that was also employed in the 
other robberies, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who police believe was Gillon, saw the officers watching him, and he 
and his accomplice got away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After he realized he was under surveillance, he laid low for about two weeks, 
which was the longest period between robberies," said Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on Tuesday night, Watson said officers following Gillon watched him 
and Younger case three fast-food places before the pair settled on a Del Taco 
restaurant in Northridge, at the corner of Lassen Street and Tampa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said police again watched as Younger got out of the Dodge and placed a 
rag over the car's license plate, but this time Gillon did not see the officers 
and they waited until he robbed the store before moving in to arrest the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I asked him why (he allegedly robbed the stores), he said he needed to 
pay his bills," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gillon may not have paid many bills with his take, which Watson 
estimated at less than $100 from each location. "They don't keep that much 
money in registers," Watson said.

BANK ROBBERY SUSPECT SOUGHT BY FBI AGENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are seeking a suspected bank robber, 
dubbed the "Yuppie Bandit," who had a shootout with a customer earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who is about 6 feet tall and 30 years old, approached a teller at 
Hawthorne Savings and Loan in Mission Viejo at 11:30 a.m. on Aug. 5.A customer, 
Daniel Phillip Seelinger of Laguna Niguel, shot at the alleged robber as he 
left the bank. The robber returned fire and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Seelinger was later arrested on suspicion of carrying a concealed weapon. 
Charges are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI Special Agent Gary Morley described the suspect as white with short, dark 
hair and a tanned complexion. He was wearing a golf shirt and trousers and 
carried a black handgun, possibly an automatic, at the time of the robbery.

PART-TIME LIFEGUARDS GET A SINKING FEELING; LABOR: CITY PUTS OFF RECOGNITION OF 
SEASONAL CREW'S NEWLY FORMED UNION. 'WE MAKE 99% OF RESCUES ON THE BEACH,' THEY 
SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Lifeguard Lee Jacobs rescued two beach-goers on Thursday. A few hours later, 
he was the one feeling stranded. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, a 24-year-old graduate of UC Riverside, belongs to a new labor union 
of seasonal lifeguards in Huntington Beach seeking recognition from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-member group, calling itself the Surf City Lifeguards Employee Assn., 
formally submitted a petition Tuesday asking the city for formal recognition by 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a perfect sunset Thursday evening, about 15 members of the group 
gathered on the Huntington Beach Pier to press their demands for the right to 
negotiate with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we're lost. . . . We're left unrepresented," said Jacobs, who hopes 
to attend law school at Ohio State University this fall. "We make 99% of the 
rescues on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has sent the petition to its attorney for review and has not decided 
whether to grant the seasonal-lifeguard union the same bargaining power as 
other municipal unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to just shoot from the hip and make a comment when we haven't 
had the opportunity to study it," said Richard Barnard, the city's deputy 
administrator. "We want to be cautious and make sure we're following the laws 
and our personnel rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnard said officials need to determine whether part-time employees are 
entitled to the same bargaining rights as year-round workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer representing the seasonal lifeguards said the group has the right 
to organize under state law and should have won instant recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moment we filed, they were obligated to recognize us. All they had to do 
was check the names," said attorney Richard J. Silber, who also represents city 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100 part-time lifeguards, who include college students, teachers, doctors 
and lawyers, work without benefits and for lower pay than the dozen year-round 
lifeguards. They are not paid extra for overtime.

SHOOTING DEATH OF STATE OFFICIAL PROBED; INVESTIGATION: POLICE HAVE NOT YET 
BEEN ABLE TO INTERVIEW THE HUNTINGTON BEACH MAN'S WIFE, WHO WAS FOUND 
UNCONSCIOUS IN THEIR HOME AT THE SAME TIME HIS BODY WAS DISCOVERED.

 Police said Thursday that they have no clear suspect in the shooting death of 
a high-ranking state environmental official, but they have not yet been able to 
interview the man's wife, who was found unconscious in their home at the same 
time his body was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ardith Cribbs, 38, was in stable but guarded condition at Pacifica Community 
Hospital in Huntington Beach on Thursday afternoon after an apparent drug 
overdose Wednesday. Huntington Beach police Officer Mike Corcoran said she had 
regained consciousness Thursday but was too incoherent to talk to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordan L. Cribbs, 49, her husband, was found dead of a bullet wound to the 
torso about 3 p.m. Wednesday at the couple's Huntington Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also revealed Thursday that they had found a .38-caliber revolver 
believed to be the murder weapon at the Cribbs home on Elgin Circle, a quiet 
cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Police Lt. Luis Ochoa said Thursday that Ardith Cribbs is a 
possible suspect in the death of her husband and that police believe she may 
have been trying to commit suicide as well. But officers are waiting for her 
medical condition to improve so they can interview her before proceeding with a 
possible arrest, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't talked to her yet; that's what they're waiting for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran noted that there was no sign of forced entry and that the door to the 
house was unlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody could have been there -- a friend, a relative. She could have done it 
herself; he could have done something. . . . Until we talk to her, we really 
don't know," Corcoran said. "From what everyone is saying, they seem like a 
nice couple. It's very strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gordan Cribbs' three grown children from a previous marriage 
mourned Thursday in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it happened -- I just keep picturing it in my head," said a sobbing 
Kendra Cribbs, 21. "He didn't deserve it. He was a good man." 
</P>
<P>
 A native Californian, Gordan Cribbs graduated from Ventura High School in 1962 
and Humboldt State College in 1966. He worked for more than 25 years at the 
state Department of Fish and Game, starting as a warden on a patrol boat and 
rising to regional patrol chief for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an animal lover who enjoyed sports, fishing, hunting and photography, 
according to a statement from the Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordan Cribbs divorced his first wife about eight years ago and married Ardith 
about five years ago, said Kendra Cribbs, who last saw her father last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came over to pick up my brother, and they went out for pizza," she 
remembered between tears. "I had already eaten . . . and I had plans, but I 
talked to him for a while, just 'How's it going?' and stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kendra Cribbs said that Ardith was moody and that the couple had some problems 
recently. Her father's neighbors once told her that Ardith chased Gordan around 
with a shovel, Kendra Cribbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she had a lot of problems," Kendra Cribbs said. "We always thought, 
'Someday she's going to kill him or something,' but we never really took it 
seriously. My dad wasn't a violent man at all." 
</P>
<P>
 At the state Department of Fish and Game, Cribbs was the top enforcement 
official for Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gordan Cribbs was always the consistent, exemplary wildlife protection 
officer. He was dedicated to and believed passionately in his calling," said 
Fred Worthley, regional manager of the Department of Fish and Game, in a 
prepared statement. "Committed to department loyalty and dedicated to those 
fellow wardens he worked with daily, Gordan has great numbers of friends and 
associates in the region. This sudden loss has impacted us severely." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Kendra and Ardith, Gordan Cribbs is survived by his mother, Dessie 
Cribbs of Ventura; his brother, Hal Cribbs, who lives in Northern California; 
and two sons, Sean, 25, who lives in Orange, and Sokie, 19, of Huntington 
Beach. Funeral plans are pending.

MAN SHOT, CRITICALLY HURT IN SANTA ANA ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old man was in critical condition late Thursday after being shot in 
the back in an alley behind the 2200 block of North Bristol Street, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana man, whom police have not identified, was found in the alley 
after patrol officers heard shots fired in the area just before 9 p.m., Sgt. 
Dick Faust said. The victim was first taken to nearby Doctors Hospital of Santa 
Ana and then transferred to UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers chased a fleeing vehicle from the scene to 10th and Bristol streets, 
where it was stopped and three teen-agers arrested on suspicion of attempted 
murder.

NEW TAX TO SAVE LIBRARIES RECOMMENDED; FUNDING: TASK FORCE REPORT SAYS UP TO 10 
COUNTY BRANCHES WILL HAVE TO CLOSE UNLESS SHORTFALL CAN BE OFFSET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 To avoid closing county libraries, a task force is proposing a new tax to 
solve the library system's worsening budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need is crucial for doing something to finance the libraries adequately 
so they can stay open. The literary life of a community is at stake," said John 
F. Dean, county superintendent of schools and a member of the panel that 
suggested the library tax.  
</P>
<P>
 The library task force estimated that the new tax would raise $8.8 million in 
the next budget year, but the report did not specify how much that would add to 
the average homeowner's annual property tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force this week proposed a ballot initiative that would ask county 
residents to vote to establish a special district, a benefit assessment or 
parcel tax earmarked for libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the tax believe Orange County residents would support it. They 
note that other California cities, including San Francisco, South Pasadena, 
Oakland and San Francisco, have bit the bullet and voted for such taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The first general election in which such a library tax initiative could be 
considered would be in April, 1996, although a special election could be called 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been more support expressed for libraries than anything else except 
maybe public protection," said Ernie Schneider, county administrative officer 
and chairman of the library task force. "When we cut back on hours and book 
purchases, the supervisors get calls." 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials expressed reservations Thursday about whether the 
proposed bailout of county libraries would hurt city-owned libraries or put 
additional financial pressure on cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County residents will not easily accept a new tax, said Paul O. Brady 
Jr., city manager in Irvine and president of the Orange County City Managers 
Assn. He noted that it was only a few years ago that county voters agreed to a 
new highway improvement tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The library task force report, which was received this week by the County 
Board of Supervisors, is a draft and may be altered before it goes to the board 
for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft report proposes numerous potential fund-raising measures, such as 
increasing library late fines and charges for replacing lost library cards. But 
the task force concluded that a new tax, which it describes as "clearly an 
unpalatable option," is the only way to avoid further reduction in library 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is we are short $8 million to $10 million," Schneider said. 
And only about $1 million of that shortfall can be met by non-tax methods, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The county libraries, the report noted, are suffering from state legislation 
that in 1993 shifted a significant amount of property tax revenue from the 
county to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In reaction, operating days and hours at county libraries were reduced by 40%, 
the purchase of new books and other materials was sharply cut back, staffing 
was cut and maintenance was postponed.  
</P>
<P>
 Even to operate at this diminished level, the task force report said, the 
county had to dip into reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 But those reserves will run out next year when even more drastic measures 
would be necessary to balance the budget without another revenue source, the 
task force said. 
</P>
<P>
 To offset the shortfall, Bert Scott, director of the county General Services 
Agency and co-chairman of the task force, estimated that 6 to 10 of the 
county's 27 libraries would have to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Madrigal, manager of the county's branch library in Laguna Beach, 
said, "If the libraries could depend on a consistent source of revenue we could 
go on with our business of serving the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Mayor Sandra L. Genis said she believes the county is obligated to 
provide library services with the share of property tax revenue it already 
claims for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems unfair that they would continue to take the same property tax split 
but cease to provide the service," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis said that if a separate library revenue source is established, she would 
like to study the feasibility of empowering some authority other than the 
county to administer the funds and operate the libraries. Library Funding 
</P>
<P>
 Facing an anticipated $10-million shortfall next year, Orange County libraries 
are searching for ways to generate more revenue. Some possibilities, 
recommended by a county task force: 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase fees and charges such as those for overdue books and replacing 
library cards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Introduce fee-based services, renting best sellers, research and printing 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Become more aggressive in raising funds from individuals and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish partnerships with private businesses to include sale of retail 
products in gift shops. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contract with schools to provide students with library services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Add new revenue from a community service district, benefit assessment or 
parcel tax. A new tax, if approved by voters, would be reflected on property 
tax bills.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR TESTIFIES HE DIDN'T 
KILL RIVAL COLLEAGUE; COURTS: SUSPECT SAYS HE DIDN'T RESPECT THE VICTIM, A TAE 
KWON DO BLACK BELT, BUT THAT HE DIDN'T STRANGLE HER. 
</P>

<P>
 A martial arts instructor charged with strangling a rival colleague testified 
in court Thursday that he "didn't respect" or "get along" with the woman he's 
accused of killing, but also said he was not the murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Milburn, 27, faces first-degree murder and sodomy charges stemming from 
the slaying of Veronica Estrada, 29, who was the American Taekwondo Assn.'s 
top-ranked female competitor in the second-level black belt division. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Milburn testified that while he had respect for 
Estrada's talent, he had none for her leadership abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did you come to conclude she lacked leadership?" asked Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Robert Foltz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often she would use her rank to get things done," replied Milburn, who is not 
nationally ranked in martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "To whom would she direct her rank to get things done?" Foltz asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me occasionally," said Milburn. "She out-ranked me . . . We didn't respect 
each other, we bickered, we didn't get along." 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz also questioned Milburn about the day he and two others found Estrada's 
body and about how later that evening he called his then-girlfriend and asked 
her to come over, saying that he didn't want to be alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz asked Milburn why he was so upset over the death of a woman he didn't 
like or respect? 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never seen a dead body before, especially someone I knew," Milburn 
said. "You have a sense of your own mortality. It's a very intense experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege Milburn killed Estrada out of professional jealousy, in 
part because she was named instructor of the year at Taekwondo USA in Canyon 
Country, where they both taught. 
</P>
<P>
 During his testimony Thursday, Milburn said he did not kill Estrada on the 
evening of Dec. 15, 1993. His attorney has maintained he was at the martial 
arts studio and at a video store during the hour Estrada is believed to have 
been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 A motorist also testified Thursday on behalf of the defense that she twice saw 
a woman who matched Estrada's height and ethnicity walking in the vicinity of 
the crime scene shortly before Estrada is believed to have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorlinda Osborne testified that she first saw the woman walking alone, but 
that minutes later she saw her walking with a man who was about a foot taller 
than the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were walking side by side," Osborne testified. "He was in the process of 
putting his arm around her. She accepted it and leaned in to his arm."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DRIVER COULD BE CHARGED IN BOY'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old boy who died this week after falling from the back of a pickup 
truck and being crushed under a filing cabinet was a local resident who was 
helping a woman move, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, Brent Foderaro of Valencia, died shortly after midnight Wednesday, 
about an hour after the accident at the intersection of Wiley Canyon and 
Orchard Village roads, said Deputy Mark Slater of the Santa Clarita Valley 
Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the truck, Aaron Schwartz, 20, of Newhall, could face criminal 
charges under a new state law for allowing Foderaro to ride in the back, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foderaro and Schwartz were using the truck to help an unidentified woman move 
to a new residence, Slater said. He added that Foderaro was in the bed of the 
truck with a washing machine and a large file cabinet, which were secured only 
with a household extension cord. 
</P>
<P>
 When the truck turned at the intersection, the file cabinet -- loaded with 
papers and weighing at least 100 pounds -- began to move, Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schwartz looked in his side-view mirror and saw the file cabinet and Brent 
falling out onto the pavement," he said. "It appears the file cabinet landed on 
top of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Foderaro was taken by ambulance to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in 
Valencia, where he died, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz told deputies the truck was traveling about 5 m.p.h. when the 
accident occurred. But Slater said that "seems a little unrealistic to make the 
load shift, wobble and fall out." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies have seen no skid marks or other evidence to determine at 
what speed the truck was traveling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A law that went into effect Jan. 1 makes it illegal for anyone to ride in the 
back of a pickup truck without a camper shell if proper seat belts are not 
installed. Slater said deputies from the Santa Clarita station have written 105 
citations for violating the law so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal charges of involuntary manslaughter or other offenses could be sought 
against Schwartz, Slater said. The deputy added that he will probably present 
information about the accident to prosecutors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver is in control of the vehicle, and he has ultimate responsibility 
for the vehicle," Slater said.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; LYRICAL TALE OF THE O'MALLEYS' LIVES, LOVES; AWAY BY JANE 
URQUHART ; VIKING $21.95, 356 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Delicately spun from a blend of history and legend, "Away" is fiction of rare 
elegance and emotional power, reaching deeply into the collective memory of the 
Irish emigrants who left their home during the potato famine to settle in the 
New World. 
</P>
<P>
 For most, the decision to leave was hardly voluntary. The choice was between 
starvation on their blighted land, or emigration to the United States or Canada 
in the infamous coffin ships, so-called because death often claimed half of the 
passengers who made the miserable crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 The O'Malley family was barely more fortunate than others. Brian O'Malley was 
a schoolmaster, literate in English and Latin as well as Gaelic, and his tiny, 
illegal "hedge school" provided him with a minuscule income. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most of the absentee English landlords, the two eccentric brothers who 
virtually owned Rathlin Island could see the suffering of their tenants 
firsthand, and when their people were dying of hunger, they bought passage for 
many to Canada: Brian O'Malley; his wife, Mary, and their son, Liam, among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 After a journey of unspeakable hardship, they were abandoned deep in a 
Canadian forest to fend for themselves. With the help of Irish pioneers who had 
preceded them, the O'Malleys survived, but "Away" is far more than just a story 
of triumph over adversity. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1842, a ship was wrecked and its cargo of cabbages, teapots and whiskey 
barrels swept onto the shore of Rathlin Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The young girl who would some day marry Brian O'Malley was the first person on 
the beach that morning, and it was Mary who discovered a young man flung over 
two of the whiskey barrels. 
</P>
<P>
 He "opened two sea-green eyes and spoke the name Moira before falling once 
again into semi-consciousness. . . . In the time it took the sun to travel from 
one cloud to the next, Mary had learned so much of him that she would have been 
able to scratch the details of his features on a rock or mold an exact replica 
of him from clay. She recognized, immediately, that he came from an otherworld 
island, assumed that he had emerged from the water to look for her, and knew 
that her name had changed, in an instant, from Mary to Moira." 
</P>
<P>
 The young man lived for only a moment more, but that moment was long enough to 
alter Mary forever. In the language of Rathlin Island, she was "away," 
possessed; her soul claimed by spirits who lived under the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary would never again be entirely of this world, though she would marry the 
schoolmaster and bear a son in Ireland, and a daughter after immigrating to 
Canada. She would perform all the arduous duties of a pioneer woman, but one 
day she would be recalled by the spirit of the sailor who had died in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary vanished into the wilderness, never to see her husband or children again. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary's daughter, Eileen, is lovingly raised by her brother, who prospers 
wonderfully in Canada, but there's something "away" about Eileen as well. 
</P>
<P>
 She, too, falls in love -- once and forever with the Canadian-Irish radical 
Aidan Lanighan, a disciple of patriot D'Arcy McGee. Eileen runs away from the 
grand home her brother, Liam, has created for her, finds the love of her life 
and briefly lives with him. Though she tries to understand Aidan Lanighan's 
mission, he never confides in her, and she is duped by one of his enemies. 
Believing she's acting according to her lover's orders, she gives a gun to the 
man who assassinates D'Arcy McGee. Lanighan holds Eileen responsible, and 
overcome by guilt and remorse, she returns to her brother's house, never to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 This intricate, lyrical novel is recalled piecemeal by Esther O'Malley 
Robertson. The language throughout is remarkable, the rhythms subtly suggesting 
the music of Gaelic; the prose gradually becoming more contemporary but 
maintaining a distinctive Irish inflection. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther, the elderly granddaughter of Mary, has inherited Liam's enormous farm 
and devoted her life to its management. Now sand has drifted over the 
buildings, and the once-lush fields have become a gigantic gravel quarry. 
Esther O'Malley Robertson is "the last and the most subdued of the extreme 
women. She was told a story at twelve that calmed her down and put her in her 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 It will do that and much more for everyone who reads it.

 I think I became a journalist because of Clark Kent. It wasn't my first career 
preference, I assure you. Had I figured out how to fly, I'm sure I would have 
opted for Superman. Kent -- at least as portrayed by the late George Reeves in 
the old "The Adventures of Superman" -- seemed like the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
 From the ages of 4 to 8 that TV show was the centerpiece of my life. I wore 
red capes, I stretched out my arms and whoossshed. I disguised myself with 
sunglasses. My mother used the promise of watching "Superman" to stop me from 
crying when I got tetanus shots. She sewed me a man-of-steel suit. Later, when 
I grew up, I became a Clark Kent kind of guy. You know, mild-mannered reporter 
for a great metropolitan newspaper (the old Herald-Examiner, on a good day), 
with glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, I've always been in love with Lois Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I don't mean Margot Kidder or Teri Hatcher or various others who have 
played the role well enough. To me, there is only one Lois Lane -- the 
unflappable, perky, sweet version from the old 1940s serials and the majority 
of the "Adventures of Superman" series. I'm talking about the lovely Noel 
Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple months ago, while watching a late-night rerun of the "Mrs. Superman" 
episode (in which Lois marries Clark/Superman in a dream sequence), still 
feeling the ache of unrequited affection, I decided to do something about it. 
I'd been Clark Kent-ing around long enough. It was time to put away mild 
manners. 
</P>
<P>
 So I called her up and asked for a date. (All right, an interview.) Lois -- I 
mean Noel. After repeatedly getting her answering machine (it chirped, "I'm off 
to the Daily Planet! Leave a message" -- no kidding), I finally reached her. 
And she accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 She has beautiful, wavy silver hair now, and has aged as gracefully as the 
cliche hasn't. Her voice -- the clear, lyrical Minnesota, land-of-10,000-lakes 
variety -- hasn't really changed. We met at her charming Santa Monica Canyon 
home of 30-plus years, chatted in her sunny, orange- and yellow-highlighted 
living room, then strolled down the hill to famed Patrick's Roadhouse for 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, George (Reeves) directed part of the 'Mrs. Superman' episode, where 
I dreamed I was going to marry him," she recalled, sipping coffee and raising 
her voice above PCH traffic. "It was really quite a cute little thing. At the 
very end, before I realize I've been dreaming, George and Jack Larson (Jimmy 
Olsen) and John Hamilton (Perry White) come to see why I haven't come to work. 
I rush up to George and say, 'Oh, darling!' And then, when I find out it's been 
a dream, I actually shed a little tear." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is exactly what Neill did as she retold this story, remarking 
apologetically, "certain little things make me misty." 
</P>
<P>
 And well they might. Reeves died in 1959 of a gunshot wound in what was 
officially ruled a suicide. (Friends suspected foul play.) A dispirited Neill 
promptly quit acting and went to work in public relations. She and Larson, who 
later became a highly respected writer of plays and opera librettos, have since 
"carried the flag" for the beloved old series, touring colleges extensively in 
the '70s and '80s. Neill still makes the occasional appearance at the more 
well-run and dignified celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most memorable convention anecdote is so good it bears repeating: 
</P>
<P>
 "A fellow came up to me," she told me. "Obviously, from the way he looked, he 
was with a rock group -- and he was, shall I say, very 'happy.' He looked at me 
and said, 'Oooohhhhhhh! You know what I used to do when I was little?' I said 
'No, I don't know what you did.' He said, 'Well, I used to run home from 
school, run in the house, crawl under our television set, and try to look up 
your dress!' I loved that." 
</P>
<P>
 We spent most of the afternoon talking of: her father, Minneapolis 
newspaperman George Neill, a respected editor of the '40s and '50s who wanted 
his little girl to be a reporter; how in a way, he got his wish. Of how placid 
L.A. and Hollywood used to be; of a more innocent Santa Monica beach where 
Neill and girlfriends played volleyball and "chased boys." Of how her name is 
real, is pronounced like "the first Noel," and had nothing to do with Christmas 
(she was born on Thanksgiving). And of her storybook career, a kind of 
hometown-girl-makes-good tale from a Hollywood that no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mother and I drove out here (in the mid-'40s), visiting relatives along the 
way," she said. "Through a friendly neighbor, we stayed a while in Hollywood. 
This neighbor was a musician who said, 'Oh, I heard you used to sing a little 
bit.' He said that an orchestra was looking for a singer -- 'why don't you come 
down and audition?' Anyway, I got the job, and it was for one season down at 
the Del Mar racetrack. Naturally, I met a lot of people, and agents, and the 
next thing I knew I was working at Paramount!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was all on the up-and-up, she said. No casting couch stuff -- thanks, in 
part, to Bing Crosby, whom she met while singing at Del Mar. (Crosby was one of 
the big stockholders of the track.) One sunny afternoon on the Paramount lot, 
der Bingle tooled up behind Neill on his bicycle, lazily buh-buh-booing to 
himself. "Hi, Noel," he said, "how's everything?" Fine, said Noel. "Well," said 
Bing, "if anybody gives you any trouble or anything, you just call my brother 
and it will be taken care of." Said Noel: "His brother Larry was an agent. I 
said, 'thank you.' Well, that probably helped a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The Midwestern girl with the dark red hair and blue-gray eyes suddenly found 
herself much in demand. Often loaned to other studios (like many actors of the 
day), Neill wound up working for MGM, RKO, Warner Bros., Republic and Monogram 
by her mid-20s. Mostly, there were gobs of Westerns and bit parts and B movies 
(including a Charlie Chan movie called "Sky Dragon" and "Lady of Burlesque," 
with Barbara Stanwyck). 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, you could get a job. It was, 'Well, maybe we need a brunette 
or a blonde for the part' -- it was simple. . . . If you had a break in 
shooting, you could always do a couple of days in a Western." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked how Lois -- er, Noel -- became Lois? Like she said, it was simple. 
Someone merely tipped her off to the part in a Superman movie serial, starring 
Kirk Alyn as Superman, and she got it. The serial's popularity led to the 
casting of a TV series in 1951. Neill joined the TV show when its first Lois, 
Phyllis Coates, quit after the first 26 episodes. Neill defined the part over 
the next 76. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were wonderful people," she said. "George was a gentle, kind-spirited 
guy. That was his charm. That was him. He was like a Southern gentleman on the 
set. Always in a game of gin rummy on the set. John (Hamilton), who was in so 
many movies, was quite a storyteller. . . . Jack and I -- he lives not far away 
-- are closer than we've ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As our talk went on, I still found myself blurring the actress and her famous 
character. I'd known Lois, after all, a lot longer than Neill. Then it hit me 
-- the main difference between the two, perhaps, is that Neill wouldn't have 
hung around waiting for Superman to get her out of a jam. This is a person who 
regularly treks off to such places as the Galapagos, to see those noble 
tortoises, or Komodo Island, to look at the famed dragons. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a kind of super-analogy here; I think Lois was Noel's mild-mannered 
alter ego. Although not so mild that Miss Lane didn't have an unexpected impact 
on girls, way back when. A touch of surprise, even pride, slipped into Neill's 
voice when she told me: 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite a few of the little gals at the colleges would say they were inspired 
when they were growing up by the fact that Lois Lane could work with men," she 
said. "They said that's how they got into journalism. It was very flattering 
that the character inspired them." 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the day, with a brisk breeze coming off the ocean, we walked back to 
the home she shares with her cat, Fang, and pored over a giant scrapbook. 
"There's the kid," she said with some amusement, as we scanned clipping after 
clipping of a long-legged starlet in newspapers and magazines ("what they used 
to call 'leg art' ") -- everything from Louella Parsons' column to reports in 
the hometown Minneapolis press. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at all the pictures, I must say I found myself wishing that my decades 
might have coincided a little more conveniently with those of Noel Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, who was I kidding? She never had a romantic interest in Clark Kent 
kinds of guys anyhow. Or was that just her character's preference? Either way, 
I might as well face it. To her I'll always be another one of those little kids 
from the 1950s who crawled under the TV and tried to see up Lois Lane's dress. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, it didn't work.

AROUND TOWN: COLOR THIS PEACEFUL; WHAT DO YOU GET WHEN YOU INTRODUCE BUDDHIST 
CONCEPTS TO THE MTV CROWD? PUZZLEMENT. AND GRATITUDE. 
</P>

 East is East -- a cloistered Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the foothills of 
the Himalayas -- and, in this case, West is Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 And the twain definitely have met. 
</P>
<P>
 It's happening through August at the Watts Towers Arts Center, where four 
monks in scarlet and gold robes (Trojan colors, someone noted) are teaching 
Buddhist tenets of compassion, discipline and respect for all living things. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle: The mandala, the sacred sand "painting" that dates to 600 BC as 
an integral part of Buddhist teaching rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 In one room, the monks are creating their Wheel of Compassion mandala, a 
design as exquisite as fine embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at the center of a circle, they draw a lotus flower with eight petals 
-- homes of the deities of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Within them, they will "paint" blue thunderbolts (for strength), a yellow gem 
(for wish fulfillment), a wheel (for transporting ideas) and a sword (for 
cutting through ignorance). 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, the youngsters are bent over their own mandala. In the center, they 
draw a peace symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the petals they paint the names of their heroes: Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, 
Jackie Robinson, Martin Luther King Jr. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Very creative," says monk Champa Lhunpo, helping a young artist straighten an 
errant line with a wooden scraper, or shinga . Lhunpo knows about Malcolm and 
King, but who is this other name . . . Spike Lee? 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine, if you can, two more diverse cultures," says Barry Bryant, the 
program coordinator and founder of New York-based Samaya Foundation, whose 
mission is to bring Tibetan culture to Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Batiste, the Watts center's education coordinator, puts it a bit more 
directly: "At first the kids thought the monks were a little weird." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The project, originally called "Healing Violence Through Art," has traveled a 
rather bumpy road since it began Aug. 2. By consensus, its name was changed 
from the lofty "Healing Violence Through Art" to the more realistic "Healing 
the Causes of Violence Through Art." 
</P>
<P>
 What do you get when you introduce Buddhist concepts to the MTV Generation? 
For one thing, puzzled looks. Tibet? Where's that? Compassion? What's that? 
</P>
<P>
 This is an inner-city pilot project for Samaya and, coming in, Bryant was a 
bit naive. Says Mark Greenfield, director of the Watts center, "You're dealing 
with children who are desperate for attention" and will act out to get it. "He 
thought they'd all just fall in line." 
</P>
<P>
 It took half a day just to establish order. Greenfield suggested a little 
Eastern meditation; it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the first day, 30 kids came; the next day, 15 returned. This is Watts. 
Transportation is a problem. Competing summer programs provide free lunch and, 
Greenfield says, "If that's the only meal they get that day, they're not going 
to give it up." 
</P>
<P>
 On a given day, five or 60 may show up. The Carter kids -- Melva, 14, Duncan, 
11, and Haywood, 6 -- come every day. Melva has caught the spirit: "I took time 
out and just loved." 
</P>
<P>
 So has Arnisha Duffey, 15: "I'm learning to do something that I've never done 
before." He knows about violence: "I've had some gangbangers shootin' at me."  
</P>
<P>
 One day, about a dozen Probation Department kids are brought in. One, trying 
his hand, balks when told to fill in a square with red sand; his gang color is 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
 At the monks' mandala, Tenzin Thokme explains the mandala's function both as a 
teaching tool and as a collaborative exercise. Two other monks bend over the 
6-foot-by-6-foot tabletop, filling in a pattern they've drawn with a silver 
Magic Marker. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not some exercise in unbridled creativity. The monks have spent four 
or five years memorizing the designs of some of the thousands of mandalas that 
initiate them into the teachings of Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
 The monks dip a chakpu , a cone-shaped funnel with a corrugated spine, into 
the cups of dyed sand and, resting it lightly in the palm, rasp it with a 
second funnel. The vibrations force the sand out the tip. The lines and circles 
are virtually faultless. In the event of a rare error, they place a cloth over 
the larger hole at the top of the chakpu and suck up the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the monks, Thupten Choephel and Tenzin Kalsang, came here from India. 
Lhunpo is from the Ithaca, N.Y., Institute of Buddhist Studies, a branch of the 
Dalai Lama's home monastery, Namgyal, in Dharamsala, India. There, monks teach 
Tibetan Buddhism. Mandala-making is "sort of our part-time job." 
</P>
<P>
 Thokme, 33, is at Santa Monica College, studying architecture, a skill he'll 
need "when we get our country back." He speaks of "our country" even though he 
has never lived in Tibet; in 1959, a Tibetan rebellion was crushed by Chinese 
troops, monasteries destroyed and Buddhism suppressed. The Dalai Lama and 
100,000 Tibetans fled to India. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in 1973, artist and filmmaker Bryant first saw a mandala. Eager to 
introduce it to the West, he asked the Dalai Lama, who said "no, no, no." 
</P>
<P>
 But, with growing Western interest in Buddhism, monastic secrets were being 
spilled -- and misrepresentations spread. The Dalai Lama relented. Since 1988, 
the monks have done numerous exhibitions at museums and galleries. Indeed, 
there's a cottage industry in postcards and calendars. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A.'s Cultural Affairs Department liked the Watts project and provided 
staffing plus $2,500 of the $40,000 to cover costs, including the monks' 
housing and travel costs. The Flow Fund, a Rockefeller philanthropy, gave 
$20,000, and private donations helped. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant's still short, but money isn't his only challenge. Right off, he found 
himself confronting "Buddhist speak" versus "Watts speak." He spent a week with 
the monks "just talking to them about how to simplify this." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bryant first asked the kids to name their protectors, "I got blank 
stares." One boy said, "There's nobody but me who's going to protect me." What 
about your dad? Bryant asked. The boy had never seen him. 
</P>
<P>
 One youngster drew in each of the lotus flower petals a small heart and 
R.I.P.; another, Jordan 33 (as in Michael). One kid suggested Michael Jackson 
as a protector; the others just laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final week, the kids will make a circular 75-foot lawn mandala out of 
recycled objects. The lesson: Respect for nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Aug. 30, the last day, they'll stage an original rap opera. Finally, 
the monks and their proteges, following Tibetan ritual, will dismantle the 
mandalas, sweep the sand into an urn and empty it into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 This is closure, not destruction. The mandalas will have fulfilled their 
purposes. The deities will be asked to return to their celestial abodes. The 
consecrated sand will purify the water; the water will evaporate into the 
clouds and a cleansing rain will fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Batiste would have liked to see more focus on respect than on 
combatting violence, she thinks the project is valuable if only "to get some 
kids to have an attention span that lasts more than two seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 And, she adds, "The kids probably have a better rapport with the monks than 
with any adult figure they've seen in a while."  
</P>
<P>
 "It could be Santa Claus," says Bryant, and they'd still be wary.

THE SHARP SHOOTER; LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM, LAWRENCE O'DONNELL JR. IS SHAKING UP 
WASHINGTON. HIS TAKE-NO-PRISONERS STYLE MAKES HIM THE CONSUMMATE OUTSIDER ON 
THE INSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Lawrence O'Donnell Jr. might just be the hippest policy wonk ever to don a 
pair of wingtips. 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not at work as the powerful, even feared, staff di rector of the 
influential Senate Finance Committee, he's roaring through Washington on his 
Harley Davidson. On weekends he heads home to Manhattan to be with his 
movie-star wife and infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He is pals with entertainment industry creatures of every stripe, from moguls 
to writers. He has appeared on "Saturday Night Live," and other TV producers 
lust after him. Cristophe (who else?) has cut his hair. And he savors his 
standing as a Capitol Hill outsider, shaking things up, picking up some enemies 
but no regrets -- a short-timer dropping by in devoted service to Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell's days as staff director for the Finance Committee are long and 
hectic. It's not uncommon for him to work 18-hour days -- assisting Moynihan on 
the Senate floor and meeting with other senators and their staffs. He spends 
hours fielding telephone calls from everyone from White House advisers to the 
media to consumer advocate Ralph Nader. Back-to-back meetings getting an earful 
from lobbyists, barking out orders to staffers and lining up votes are all part 
of a day's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Loved and loathed, respected and feared, he shatters the stereotype of your 
typical Senate staffer -- especially one who has the task of ushering through 
committee such weighty legislation as health care and welfare reform, the 
budget and NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Said White House adviser George Stephanopoulos, who has worked closely with 
O'Donnell on major issues: "How many staff directors drive motorcycles and 
commute to New York to write screenplays?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Valentine's Day this year, O'Donnell and Kathryn Harrold stopped in Las 
Vegas on their way to Los Angeles, where they have a home, and got married in a 
quickie ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 She was about five months pregnant, and Capitol Hill's irony mavens noted with 
relish that O'Donnell's boss has long made an issue of the problem of children 
born out of wedlock. Although some joked that an embarrassed Moynihan had 
pressured his committee staff director to get married, O'Donnell denied that it 
was ever an issue. Moynihan agreed: "I wouldn't dream of it. They were an old 
married couple when I met them." 
</P>
<P>
 To those who admire O'Donnell -- whose sarcasm and wit endeared him to his 
colleagues at the Harvard Lampoon -- he is a flash of brilliance and 
creativity, a diamond among Washington's ranks of drab bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the luckiest man I know because he's married to Kathryn Harrold, he's 
maybe the smartest man and he sure as hell is the toughest," Moynihan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you meet someone like him in Washington, it's refreshing," said Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) "He's a pragmatist. He doesn't have much patience for 
wasted words. God, that's a relief." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, called 
O'Donnell "a Renaissance man. He's a unique . . . and dashing fellow. One thing 
he is not, is dull." 
</P>
<P>
 But to those who disdain O'Donnell, a 42-year-old native of Boston, he is 
imperious, egotistical, foul-mouthed and Machiavellian. "He has an ego as big 
as a senator," said someone from the White House who has dealt with O'Donnell. 
This person, like all of O'Donnell's critics, insisted on anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell said he couldn't care less about what people think of him. "I don't 
for one second spend any time thinking about carefully ingratiating myself with 
someone for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he came to Washington to work for Moynihan, chairman of the Finance 
Committee, because of his admiration and respect for the New York Democrat. 
When he finally gives it up, O'Donnell said he'll have no desire to stick 
around. "There is no other thing in Washington I can imagine interesting me. 
So, I'll leave with whatever enemies I pick up. . . . And I will ask Washington 
for no favors when I'm gone." 
</P>
<P>
 "When they say he's arrogant, I suppose they are referring to his capacity for 
telling people to go to hell," said O'Donnell's father, Lawrence Sr., a 
73-year-old Boston lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like pointing my finger in the face of the king, as they say," he added. 
"He's like that, too. He's not on a hero-worship kick. I would be disappointed 
if people weren't taking shots at him. It means he's shaking things up." 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming to Washington in 1992, O'Donnell has become a frequent guest on 
the PBS talk show "Charlie Rose." True to his rogue image, he recently appeared 
on the program unshaven, wearing a denim shirt, looking as if he'd just roared 
in on his chopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he turned down an offer by Fox to anchor a news program in Los 
Angeles. "I was fascinated by the offer. . . . I can't make a million dollars 
in the Senate," he said with a laugh. "I was interested but it came a year too 
early." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, John Bowman, executive producer of "Murphy Brown," wants O'Donnell, 
Moynihan and Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) to appear as guests on the show, although 
none has yet agreed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to have (O'Donnell) on. He's so cool . . . very funny and 
incredibly bright, creative . . . and independent," Bowman said of his friend 
from their days together at the Harvard Lampoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman recalled that O'Donnell was on the business staff of the famed college 
humor magazine. "I don't think he ever sold a single ad. But . . . he was so 
cool they wanted him on the staff whether he did anything or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Even back in college, O'Donnell "never made any attempt to pretend to like 
anybody he didn't," said Bowman, a former "Saturday Night Live" writer. "He was 
always straightforward. He had a very good sense of himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Henson, president of Columbia Pictures, described O'Donnell as a kind of 
"accidental genius." Henson, who was the first woman editor of the Lampoon, 
also met O'Donnell at Harvard and the two have been friends since. "He's 
sophisticated . . . original and he's unpredictable," she said. "He's so good 
on his television appearances. I could listen to him talk for hours." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 Democratic convention, he teamed with comedian Al Franken to 
provide humorous commentary for the Comedy Central cable network, poking fun 
at, among others, Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell grew up in the Dorchester area of Boston, the youngest of five 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ended up going to Harvard College, which was about as likely in my 
neighborhood as going to the moon," O'Donnell said. Nevertheless, he remained 
true to the group he grew up with: "I was very much a street guy." 
</P>
<P>
 But even though it was the psychedelic era, O'Donnell -- unlike many of his 
peers -- refused to drink, smoke or use drugs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted making eccentric choices back in high school, college and beyond, 
though. "I was an extreme leftist-anarchist. Now, I guess I'm a European 
socialist who's locked into American citizenship, without complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 His father said O'Donnell was the kind of kid who would leave the comforts of 
the family's summer home at Cape Cod and go into the city to "clean out dirty 
buildings for a civic association . . . to create housing for people." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Harvard with a degree in economics, O'Donnell said he 
was "an itinerant writer," working on everything from TV pilots to Op-Ed 
pieces, and hung out in New York clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, while working as a parking attendant in the Combat Zone section of 
Boston, his father came to tell him about a police brutality case he was 
working on. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'It's the best case I've ever had and I think you could write about it,' he 
told me," the younger O'Donnell said. "That week, I went up to his office, sat 
down and read through 30 police reports on the case and was just permanently 
mesmerized by this story." 
</P>
<P>
 Working as a researcher and investigator for his father, they sued the Boston 
Police Department on behalf of an African American mother whose husband had 
been shot and killed two years earlier by two police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year court fight led to the downfall of a police commissioner and 
prompted a book by the younger O'Donnell, "Deadly Force" (William Morrow, 
1983), which was later turned into a television movie. 
</P>
<P>
 During this time, O'Donnell said, he was attacked, beaten and arrested in the 
parking lot where he worked by officers from the same unit involved in the 
brutality case. He later sued the police for violation of his civil rights. He 
won damages in federal court, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Harrold, who has appeared as a regular on "I'll Fly Away" and "The 
Larry Sanders Show," met him about six years ago, O'Donnell had gone through 
most of the money he had earned from the book and movie. (He also had shared 
some of the proceeds with the widow, his father said.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Lawrence was doing nothing. He was absolutely broke," Harrold recalled. "He 
had been really poor while he was writing the book, and he hadn't been making a 
cent." 
</P>
<P>
 So when money finally did start coming in, she added, "I think he just lived 
like a normal human being. He did things like buy clothes. And he got a nice 
apartment, which he deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 They met at a surprise 30th birthday party for one of O'Donnell's New York 
housemates at the time, Maura Moynihan, the Senator's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'd gone through just about everything," Harrold said. "But I said, 
'here's this great guy, this really smart, funny, wonderful person.' And that's 
all that mattered to me. So, whatever happens with (Lawrence) is just gravy." 
</P>
<P>
 Through his daughter, Moynihan met O'Donnell and was dazzled by him -- "it was 
a match made in heaven," Maura Moynihan said -- and within months, the Senator 
had hired the political novice to work on his 1988 reelection campaign. 
O'Donnell quickly became Moynihan's senior adviser, then Finance Committee 
staff director. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his friend and mentor, Moynihan, O'Donnell's political philosophy evolved 
over the years. He said the difference between his views in the 1970s and now 
is that "I no longer resent the idea that Bob Dole has a vote, and an important 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was the slow discovery for me in the early '80s that Republicans are 
people too. . . . That Republicans are perfectly reasonable people . . . and 
that Republicans can be right about something." 
</P>
<P>
 He's been described as Moynihan's alter ego. But "that couldn't be more 
absurd," O'Donnell said. Moynihan has more education, more experience, has 
written more books and is far more industrious, he argued. "I personally, can't 
think of a greater insult to Sen. Moynihan or a greater praise to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Boxer said O'Donnell is "extremely effective because of his special 
relationship with Pat Moynihan. That kind of relationship is rare in life. 
There is a certain kinship there." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are quick to criticize that relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lawrence brings out the worst in Moynihan," said a White House staffer. "He 
fosters and encourages the testy Moynihan, the easily offended Moynihan, the 
Moynihan who reads insults when they are not given." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one Administration official: "He's adopted Moynihan's intellectual 
arrogance, but without the intellect." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan rejects the suggestion by some that O'Donnell has been given too much 
clout. "If I had any more power, I would give that to him too. . . . He's a 
superbly able man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Moynihan -- with O'Donnell at his side -- led Senate debate on the 
health care bill offered by Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Me.). Mitchell's 
health care plan incorporates much of the original bill O'Donnell helped 
forward through the Finance Committee in June. (The House is considering 
another plan put forward by House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and 
Senate Republicans are pushing yet another version put together by Minority 
Leader Dole (R-Kan.)). 
</P>
<P>
 There had been talk on Capitol Hill that some senators, staff and even White 
House officials were furious about actions and remarks by Moynihan and 
O'Donnell they felt undermined Clinton's health care plan in the Finance 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 White House adviser Stephanopoulos denies that the White House has any ill 
feelings toward them or thinks that they dropped the ball on health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did their best," he said. "It's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied that there were any hard feelings over Moynihan's televised 
description of part of the President's health plan as fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just bumps in the road," Stephanopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as their work on health care reform, Boxer defended O'Donnell and 
Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that had Daniel Patrick Moynihan and O'Donnell . . . done 
everything as the President said, they would not have had a bill at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, the White House may have thought they were obstructionists. But 
in truth, they were the saviors because they maintained a level of 
independence." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Harrold said she doesn't believe that her husband will pack up and 
leave Washington when he's finished working with Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's addicted," she said. Politics "gets in their blood. And it's happened to 
him."O'

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; HEALTH-CARE GAME BEATS REAL THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like all good Americans, you are surely tuning into C-SPAN every day to watch 
the health-care debate in Congress, making sure that you stay informed about 
all the issues involved in this topic so vital to our national interest. 
</P>
<P>
 No? Join the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over health reform, while undeniably important, is not exactly up 
there with the Anita Hill testimony when it comes to dramatic television. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, after watching for just a few minutes you get the distinct impression 
that most legislators are, as usual, just playing games. Now you can play the 
health-reform game, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "SimHealth" is the computer-simulation game that asks the question "Is there a 
Hillary in the house?" From the same company that produced the popular 
"SimCity" and its futuristic sequel, "SimCity 2000," this game allows you to 
devise a health-care plan on your home computer and then watch how it affects a 
community over 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the computer-game world of galactic battles and spooky role-playing games, 
you might think there wouldn't be much of a niche for entertainment based on 
health-care policies, and you'd be right. The creation of "SimHealth" -- which 
is distributed by Maxis software, lists for $29.95 and is available only in the 
DOS format -- was subsidized by the Markle Foundation, which has been 
supporting educational projects since 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 The game starts with a little on-screen vignette that shows you getting into a 
traffic accident. Your injuries are minor but require a visit to the emergency 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 You get so fed up with the bureaucracy and paper work, not to mention the high 
cost of the small amount of care you receive, that you decide to run for office 
on the platform of health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 You're elected, and the fun begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "SimHealth" first asks you to make a few philosophical and moral decisions 
based on your feelings about liberty, equality, efficiency and community. These 
kinds of issues hardly ever come up in "Mortal Kombat." 
</P>
<P>
 It's no fair being totally in favor of all of these attributes. Being totally 
for liberty, for example, means you could do anything you please and this would 
clash with unlimited equality. And what is best for a community is not always 
the most efficient path. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a clever diamond-shaped graphic, "SimHealth" challenges you to strike a 
balance among these values. Then you start putting together your policies, 
determining how much business, individuals and government should contribute to 
national health insurance. You also make choices about cost controls and 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "SimHealth" doesn't oversimplify these issues for game play. In order to play 
a serious round of "SimHealth," you'll have to carefully study the options 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you're ready to see what effect your policies have. The community, 
represented by a graphic showing about 10 city blocks, includes a major 
hospital, a family-practice office complex, a high-tech medical-research firm, 
a city hall, a big insurance company and several small businesses. You begin 
your first term as mayor in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As the months go by, the condition of the buildings reflects your policies. If 
you overtax businesses, they crumble before your eyes, becoming abandoned 
eyesores. Allow ample patient benefits and the family-practice building adds 
floors to handle the high volume. Put a strict cap on doctors' fees, and the 
doctors begin to move out. 
</P>
<P>
 You can continually change your policies (like any politician) to try and 
remedy the ills of your community, but every decision has its costs. Force 
insurance companies to cover some costly, new high-tech procedure and the 
ominous high-tech facility will get bigger. But the insurance building might 
soon be in need of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't win "SimHealth" by devising the best possible health-care plan. This 
is the real world, so you win only if you keep getting reelected. To guide you, 
the game presents you with periodic polls to show what the citizenry thinks of 
your policies. Every four years it gets a chance to keep or replace you. 
</P>
<P>
 As the game years pass, whatever high ideals you had at the beginning get 
somewhat compromised: 
</P>
<P>
 Reduce benefits so the overcrowded medical facilities can improve care and cut 
down on waiting times? No, it might cost votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Force insurance companies to cover a new, somewhat experimental treatment? 
Sure, as long as it doesn't cost too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Raise revenue by making people pay more of their Medicare costs? Are you nuts? 
</P>
<P>
 "SimHealth" is almost too real. Play it and you'll soon be saying, "There must 
be a better way."

THE GOODS; SMOOTH OPERATORS; CRAFTY TELEPHONE CROOKS ARE BILKING AMERICANS OUT

 Earlier this year when a San Francisco widow in her 80s went to her tax 
preparer, she brought along a grocery bag filled with $17,500 worth of canceled 
checks for 1993. All were written to slick-talking telemarketers who had sold 
her fraudulent investments, not-so-free sweepstakes winnings, and vacations and 
products that were supposed to be valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the "big" prizes were two 19-inch TV sets that cost her $2,000, plaques, 
boxes of pens and pencils, cheap jewelry, Christmas ornaments, cleaning 
products, health and beauty supplies, stackable frying pans that lost their 
handles when she tried to use them, and almost 100 boxes of yellow Frisbees 
imprinted, ironically enough, with the Nancy Reagan anti-drug slogan, "Just Say 
No." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironic, because "no" is exactly what fraud experts counsel the woman should 
have said to the flim-flam phone artists in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she became a big-time victim of telemarketing fraud -- what Federal 
Trade Commission officials call "the plague of the 1990s marketplace" and the 
fastest-growing consumer fraud in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, millions of Americans, especially senior citizens, are bilked out 
of an estimated $40 billion nationwide by crafty telephone crooks pitching 
endless schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Or asking for contributions to organizations that sound legitimate but don't 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Or sending a postcard that says: "You've won one of these five prizes, but you 
must call this 900 number." That phone call usually costs the caller $3 a 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The telemarketing scam problem is so severe that special federal task forces 
have been set up across the country to try to combat it. State attorney 
generals and corporation commissions have telemarketing investigators trying to 
cope with burgeoning complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Fraud Information Center (NFIC), a project of the National 
Consumers League in Washington, D.C., operates a 24-hour national fraud hot 
line for consumers to report telemarketing fraud. That toll-free number, (800) 
876-7060, gets about 250 calls a day, said NFIC Director John Barker. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new effort to educate consumers about telemarketing fraud, the NFIC, in 
conjunction with MasterCard International, has recently launched a national TV 
campaign, "Know the difference. Hang up on fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with a telephone and a mailing address can be a victim of telemarketing 
fraud, but fraud investigators agree that the most likely prey are senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, the No. 1 target is the elderly," said Scott Stapf, investor 
education adviser for the North American Securities Administrators Assn., an 
association of state securities regulators. Stapf calls this targeting of the 
elderly "the Willie Sutton effect. When asked why he robbed banks, Sutton said, 
'because that's where the money is.' And the older generation has money to 
invest." 
</P>
<P>
 Stapf said merchandise scams are rampant, but they don't generate as large a 
loss as fraudulent investments. "Just in securities scams, the estimated losses 
are $1 million an hour nationwide," he said, explaining that much of that loss 
comes from people in their 60s, 70s and 80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The "largest dollar amount of telemarketing fraud comes from the elderly," 
said Karen Silva of the Arizona Corporation Commission's Securities Division. 
"And many are looking for alternative resources to build up their bank accounts 
since there are no longer high rates on CDs or money markets. Many are 
concerned they're going to run out of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud experts also agree that several factors can make older people especially 
easy targets for telemarketing scammers. Senior citizens often live alone, have 
no family near them, and are lonely and/or in poor health. They enjoy people 
paying attention to them, calling on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older people (tend to be) more trusting and more polite, and they don't hang 
up on people," said Dale Sekovich, senior investigator of telemarketing fraud 
for the Los Angeles office of the FTC. "Older women living alone are special 
targets. I've had victims say 'The guy called me every day, sent me cards and 
flowers. I felt like he was a son.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors also make up a larger proportion of the population today -- there are 
an estimated 55 million senior citizens in the United States -- so there are 
more to be victimized, said John Bordenet, a fraud expert with the American 
Assn. of Retired Persons criminal justice services section. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older people have more traditional values," Bordenet said. "But they also 
fool themselves into thinking that their long life experience will protect them 
and they'll be able to recognize a scam." 
</P>
<P>
 Bordenet added that telemarketing crooks have told him that is why "they 
recruit young people to make the phone calls. The older person is all the more 
likely to feel self-assured when talking to someone so young." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The latest form of telemarketing fraud involves bogus stock investments 
peddled through computer bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "A regular boiler room (the nickname for a telemarketing scam operation) can 
make 150 calls on a good day," said Arizona's Silva. "Through computer bulletin 
boards like Internet, Prodigy, Compuserve or America Online, they can contact 
thousands of people a day. They'll pitch the XYZ company, saying the stock 
looks cheap, but it's going global. Then people think, 'That sounds like a good 
deal, I'd better get in.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the person who put the message out -- he purchased the stock at $2 -- 
gets the stock up to $10 or $12 and he's out. It is very hard to trace them, 
because they can use aliases or the message can come from Japan because it's 
global." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva praised the potential of computer networking to educate people and help 
them become smarter investors, but warned consumers to beware that rip-off 
artists will be on-line too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trick is consumer education," she said. "That is such an important part, 
so we can stop it at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Although cyberspace scams are increasing as more Americans join the 
information superhighway from their homes, the majority of telemarketing fraud 
is still perpetuated on the telephone or through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Most victims who lose money to telemarketing fraud "never get a penny back," 
the FTC's Sekovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 And fraud victims can lose even more money if they fall prey to reload or 
recovery scams, said Jerry Smilowitz, a deputy attorney general in the Los 
Angeles office of the California attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Smilowitz said Southern California is experiencing an upswing in reload and 
recovery fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 A reload scam is when the same group that earlier bilked a consumer calls back 
every 30 to 60 to 90 days to get more money, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 A recovery scam is when one phony company already has defrauded a consumer, 
then sells his or her name to another scammer who calls and offers to get the 
lost cash back for a fee of $1,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people buy lead lists from companies, then call the victims and say 
they had been contacted by the federal government to help them get their money 
back," the FTC's Sekovich said. "We had one that had a list of names of older 
women who had recently collected on life insurance policies."

TIPS FOR AVOIDING TELEMARKETING SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Be wary of any offers that seem "too good to be true." They usually are. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beware of anyone who asks you to send money for a prize you have won, and do 
not buy anything over the telephone unless you are certain you are dealing with 
a familiar, reputable company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask a lot of questions and listen carefully to the answers. If the caller 
doesn't answer your questions, hang up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refuse to be pressured into making a hasty decision. The more a caller tries 
to hurry you into buying something or sending money, the more likely he is a 
crook. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never give out your credit card number or information about your bank 
account to anyone you don't know. Remind your children to never give financial 
information to callers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember: If a postcard announcing your prize tells you to call a 900 number 
to collect it, that call will cost you at least $3 a minute.  
</P>
<P>
 * Do not be embarrassed to report the fraud. If you suspect you've been a 
victim of a telemarketing scam, report it to your city attorney, county 
district attorney or state attorney general, or call the National Fraud 
Information Center hot line at (800) 876-7060. 
</P>
<P>
 Free brochures available about telemarketing scams are:

 * "Schemes, Scams & Flim-Flams: A Consumer's Guide to Phone Fraud," published 
by the National Fraud Information Center. Call (800) 999-5136.

<P>
 * "Telephone Scams and Older Consumers," published by the FTC, the American 
Assn. of Retired Persons and the National Assn. of Attorneys General. Write to 
the Federal Trade Commission, 6th & Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, D.C. 
20580.

INK: DEMISE OF MIRABELLA WAS GREATLY EXAGGERATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES. He is a columnist for Newsday.

<TEXT>
<P>
 At last year's National Magazine Awards -- the Oscars of the industry -- a 
buzz that passed through the crowd had nothing to do with the pending honors 
for feature writing, photography and design. 
</P>
<P>
 Whispers had it that Mirabella was folding. The stylish women's magazine, 
which former Vogue Editor Grace Mirabella launched for publisher Rupert Murdoch 
in 1989, was not expected to last much beyond dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirabella battled onward, refined its editorial product, weathered the loss of 
some key staffers and next week will introduce a subtle redesign as evidence 
that the magazine is here to stay -- at least for now. 
</P>

 "We have refreshed the look and renewed a commitment to substance and visual 
sophistication," said Catherine Viscardi Johnston, who left New York magazine 
to become publisher of Mirabella in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowercase is in, boldface in the text is out. A lengthy fall preview of the 
arts (rock veteran Marianne Faithfull, balladeer Jimmy Scott, playwright 
Eduardo Machado) underscores the magazine's already keen and discriminating 
interest in books, music and performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion spreads find the models away from the white-cloth backdrops and out in 
the real world. Beneath a slightly smaller logo, the image for a cover story 
about American beauty is the photographer Hiro's striking computerized assembly 
of one woman made from many ethnic portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Johnston, reports of Mirabella's imminent demise stemmed from the 
knowledge that Murdoch was considering offers to buy the magazine. After all, 
his selloff of New York, Premiere and other publications to K-III 
Communications Corp. had emptied Murdoch Magazines of all but TV Guide and 
Mirabella. 
</P>
<P>
 Unloading Mirabella so that a buyer might merge it with another woman's mag 
made sense at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as Johnston has heard the story, Murdoch was persuaded by his 
advisers to retain Mirabella and work to fulfill its potential of reaching 
women of accomplishment in the highly competitive women's field -- a field that 
will become tougher as Hearst Magazines launches an American edition of Marie 
Claire next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirabella, which has a more mature target audience and is less fashion-driven 
than Harper's Bazaar, Vogue and Elle, trails those magazines in circulation and 
ad pages. But its own numbers would appear to encourage Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
 Ad pages, which were up slightly in 1993, declined in the first half of this 
year only to rebound nicely since June. Circulation increased 24% during the 
past three years -- to about 610,000 copies a month -- and an impressive 
two-thirds of the 475,000 subscribers pay a full price of $24. This subscriber 
loyalty makes it a lot easier to alter the look of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We attract new readers through our newsstand sales, but our base (of 
subscribers) is solid so that we're not dependent on the newsstand," Johnston 
said. "We know our readers are committed to reading the magazine." 
</P>

 An Insider's Tale of Pirates: One approaches a self-published book with the 
kind of caution typically triggered by a TV infomercial. But even given Stephen 
Kiesling's solid credentials -- he wrote "The Shell Game" (Morrow) in 1982, was 
an editor at American Health and has contributed to the New Yorker and Sports 
Illustrated -- it's easy to see why he had to go it alone this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Major publishers were unlikely to publish a book that shines such a harsh 
light on some of their esteemed colleagues as well as on leading news 
organizations. "Walking the Plank" is Kiesling's first-person, often hilarious 
account of how he set out to ghostwrite the adventures of deep-sea treasure 
hunter Barry Clifford but was bounced from the project after he came to learn 
that they don't call it "fool's gold" for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford's discovery in the mid-1980s of the 18th-Century pirate ship Whydah 
lying beneath Cape Cod waters was hyped as a $400-million find. 
</P>
<P>
 The giddy prospect of bringing all that gold and treasure to the surface 
prompted Silver Screen Inc., a Wall Street bankroller of Hollywood films, to 
form a partnership with Clifford designed to salvage the loot. What's more, a 
public-stock offering raised millions of dollars toward that end. 
</P>
<P>
 But years later, all investors have to show for their excitement are the 
hundreds of coins and other artifacts from the Whydah now quietly tucked away 
in a maritime museum -- a haul that pales in value alongside the much-hyped 
visions of Midas. Kiesling says the investors were suckered; Clifford has 
denounced "Walking the Plank" as a "book of lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiesling hooked me with his salty account of pirates, Cape Cod and the sea and 
also because he argues time and again that Big Media, including Parade magazine 
and Walter Cronkite, seemed all too willing to trumpet the significance of 
Clifford's "treasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiesling, who also weaves in his own concurrent tale of a disintegrating 
marriage and a yuppie life-style on the Upper West Side, is betting $15,000 in 
printing costs that "Walking the Plank" will find an audience big enough to 
spur a New York house to publish it after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the book gains wider distribution in stores, it can be ordered directly 
from his Nordic Knight Press, in Ashland, Ore., by calling (800) DEEP SIX.

 First Woodstock, First Novel: By the time we got to Woodstock (again), Bruce 
Palmer's first novel was offering what may be the only fresh fictional take on 
the original rock festival and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Karma Charmer," newly published by Harmony Books, tells the story of 
Howser, who remained at Woodstock long enough to need looser-fitting jeans for 
his now-fortysomething form. 
</P>
<P>
 He falls in love with a college student and tries to keep her from heading 
south to a lucrative Wall Street job. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who used to earn his living as a creative director on Madison Avenue, 
was at the first Woodstock and plans to be in the crowd this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '80s, I spent a few summers in the area, and I got to know the town of 
Woodstock," he said. "I was pleased and fascinated by the fact that the old 
'60s culture is very much alive there. You can see old hippies hanging around 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary-Ann and Philip Hobel ("Tender Mercies"), who acquired the film rights to 
"The Karma Charmer," called "an entertaining, romantic tale" by Publishers 
Weekly, have made a deal with TriStar. 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin Hoffman is reportedly attached to the project.

AFTER TRAGEDY, HOPE BLOOMS; TELEVISION: BLIND ACTRESS TELLS COSTA MESA GROUP 
THAT LEGEND OF A TREE HELPED HER SNAP OUT OF DEPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hers is a story of triumph over personal tragedy and how the legend of the 
dogwood tree made it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy involves a freak accident that left actress Millicent Collinsworth 
blind -- in her late 20s. The legend, passed on by her father, is a parable 
that came to symbolize Collinsworth's emergence from a suicidal, self-pitying 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Collinsworth, who recently acted in "Flying Colors," an ABC pilot, and has 
appeared in such series as "Designing Women," told her life story here 
Wednesday to about 60 members of the Inside Edge, a private self-enrichment 
group that books inspirational speakers for weekly meetings in Costa Mesa and 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old San Dimas resident, who also writes and teaches self-defense 
for the visually impaired, stood beside her resting guide dog, a black Labrador 
retriever named Eeyore, on a platform at Scott's seafood restaurant, describing 
her idyllic childhood in rural Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 With the descriptive language and melodious lilt of a professional 
story-teller -- at times quoting her autobiography, "Millicent," published last 
year -- she recalled spending weekends at her family's Five Oaks estate, an 
erstwhile working plantation where her proudly Confederate, aristocratic 
forebears planted rice and cotton and "survived" the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was also there, she said, near woodsy fields, that her father told her the 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogwood tree was cut down to make the cross on which Christ was crucified, 
so it was cursed never to bloom again. But a miracle occurred. God gave the 
tree a second chance, bringing it back to life while placing a tiny droplet of 
red on the tip of each petal to represent its scarred past. 
</P>
<P>
 As a little girl, Collinsworth was awed by the parable, which, she said, 
"symbolized God's promise of new beginnings, the miracle of second chances." 
</P>
<P>
 As she matured, memories of Five Oaks faded. Then, one day in 1976, while 
coordinating a charity event in Irvine, her life was irrevocably altered. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the day of the accident, my spirits were soaring," she said. But walking 
past a construction site, she saw a tall ladder on which a worker was standing 
begin to teeter. Her life changed when she rushed to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "A hammer he held slipped," she said, "hitting me squarely between the eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors told her that "the trauma to my brain was so profound that I'd 
eventually become totally blind." Nine surgeries followed, she said, as well as 
a painful breakup with her boyfriend, who introduced his new lover by saying 
she looked like Collinsworth "used to look." 
</P>
<P>
 She found herself mired in a morbid depression that led to a suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw a hospital room chair through the window," Collinsworth said, and 
with the shattered glass, "slit my wrists and throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother tried tough love, reminding her daughter that life is not fair and 
calling her behavior weak and cowardly. But that did nothing, said the actress, 
who spent the next several months "begging God to let me die. I lay in my 
hospital bed, wasting away to less than 80 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point finally came with a card her mother sent from Five Oaks: 
"Spring has come. You should be here to honor it." That sentiment, and a spray 
of dogwood that fell from the envelope, did the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had made it to spring," Collinsworth said, her eyes welling up with tears. 
"It was a time for healing." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the dogwood, she had been given a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal was that I would never be looked upon as pathetic or dependent. I 
learned that a handicap is nothing more than a limitation we put on ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The road back, which entailed relearning such basic tasks as walking, was 
rough. In a two-year period, she was assaulted four times, she said, the last 
time in 1987 while riding a crowded RTD bus with Eeyore in Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 "Another passenger went berserk," said Collinsworth, who was struck in the 
face and thrown to the floor in the melee that followed. Not a single person 
offered to help, but Collinsworth managed to find her way off the bus and walk 
15 blocks home, "in tears and bleeding profusely." 
</P>
<P>
 A friend called paramedics and Collinsworth was taken to UCLA Medical Center, 
where she was given stitches in her mouth and released. The incident, however, 
motivated her to conquer new challenges. Vowing never again to be a victim, she 
contacted Impact Personal Safety, becoming the women's self-protection 
organization's first blind student. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned to sense danger by sound, smells and constant alertness and to 
physically fight for her life. Around the same time, she took up acting. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Collinsworth was certified as Impact Personal Safety's first blind 
instructor in the United States, she said, and in March, she launched Project: 
Blind Ambition, her nonprofit self-defense program promoting self-esteem along 
with personal safety for blind or partially sighted people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three out of every four blind individuals have been or will be assaulted in 
their lifetimes," she said. "That's 15 times greater than the number for 
sighted people." 
</P>
<P>
 The project's first graduating class included Henry, a young South Central 
L.A. man left bloodied and bruised by a mugging, and Cheryl, raped in her home 
by a stalker. During their graduation, she said she felt their fear and 
hopelessness replaced with a sense of dignity and grace, and her mind raced 
back to the day her father told her the story of the dogwood tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized I had truly come full circle," she said. "All my blind students 
and I, we were cursed, but a miracle had happened. We had been offered a second 
chance." 
</P>

Winebrenner, is published by WRS Publishing, a division of the WRS Group Inc.,

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THAT'S NOT GRAY IN TOM SNYDER'S HAIR, IT'S STEEL; TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Score one for the gray guys. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a scarred, rutted survivor in a lethal industry that routinely 
assassinates its own. He's so resilient that a writer once likened him to a 
big, blustery, booming boomerang that just keeps coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 Still blustering, booming and boomeranging after all these years, he remains 
one of the great characters in all of broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet will 58-year-old Tom Snyder -- only half as hip and nearly twice as old as 
his boyish opposite number on NBC -- generate enough edge, zip and sizzle to be 
competitive with "Late Night With Conan O'Brien"? Will he retain enough of the 
audience from "Late Show With David Letterman" to win over youth-craving 
advertisers? Will enough CBS stations grant him 12:35 a.m. clearances to give 
his show an even shot in the ratings? It's all very iffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Television being the ultimate roll of the dice, there's no way of 
knowledgeably forecasting how successful or unsuccessful Snyder will be in his 
scheduled return to the network crapshoot in December, when he'll host a 
post-Letterman talk/call-in series on CBS similar to the one he now heads on 
the CNBC cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more than a four-year contract, Snyder's securest safety net is that "The 
Late Late Show With Tom Snyder" is being produced by Letterman's own company, 
and CBS will do everything it can to keep its late-night superstar as happy as 
he is rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, Snyder's return to Main Street -- following peaceful stints 
as an evening talk-show host in the relatively quiet suburbs of ABC radio and 
later CNBC cable -- may become a renaissance to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the coveted spot behind Letterman gives full circle to his late-night 
rejuvenation. After all, it was as host of the often-tumultuous "Tomorrow" 
program, following Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show" on NBC, that Snyder thundered 
his way into national prominence in the 1970s. He was a brash, bombastic blast, 
inspiring caricatures as well as alliterations. He was such a major figure -- 
and his over-the-top din such an inviting target -- that Dan Aykroyd 
mercilessly lampooned him on "Saturday Night Live."  
</P>
<P>
 On another front, though, Snyder's re-emergence on network TV gives the 
medium's graying club another notable member. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an estimated 30 million Americans being over the age of 65, you 
sometimes get the impression from its programs and commercials that TV is 
almost exclusively youth-oriented. Yet the monolith has a spidery network of 
fissures (Carson himself was closing in on 70 when he departed "The Tonight 
Show"). Here are just a few of the older TV crowd's high profiles (with ages 
courtesy of "The World Almanac") who immediately come to mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * Past 70: Mike Wallace, Robert Stack, Andy Rooney, David Brinkley, Bob Barker 
and Hugh Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Past 60: Barbara Walters, Morley Safer, Dan Rather, Jim Lehrer, Robert 
MacNeil and Bill Moyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Past 50: Phil Donahue, Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw, Ed Bradley, Lesley Stahl, 
Larry King, Maury Povich and Charlayne Hunter-Gault. 
</P>
<P>
 Their prominence is significant. Television viewing generally increases after 
age 50, and the absence or denigration of peers, some experts say, can lower 
self-esteem among viewers and give them a feeling of disconnection. To say 
nothing about distorting reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Note also, however, that the above list contains few women, suggesting that 
the highest echelons of television continue to be essentially a patriarchy in 
which an aging man is deemed more acceptable than an aging woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder was enormously acceptable to Letterman, and reportedly was his personal 
pick after CBS got rejections from Garry Shandling and Bob Costas. Although 
it's doubtful that Shandling could ever be as extraordinarily amusing as a 
real-life talk-show host as he is a fictional one (on HBO's "The Larry Sanders 
Show"), Costas would have been a fitting choice to follow Letterman. His 
withdrawal from NBC's late-late- late -night arena erased a penlight of wry wit 
and intelligence from the wee-hours darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is guaranteed good theater, however, Snyder is an even more 
interesting choice. Funny without being a stand-up monologuist or a sit-down 
comic, he'll be as different from the still-raw O'Brien as O'Brien is from 
Letterman, whose own late-night hour O'Brien inherited when NBC lost Letterman 
to CBS after choosing Jay Leno to succeed Carson on "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's mellowed some, Snyder remains outspoken and easily exasperated 
by some of life's spectacles. Yet he has always been his own spectacle, a sure 
bet to stumble, a sure bet to soar. Often it happens on the same show, 
sometimes in the same sentence. In fact, his unevenness has always been a big 
part of his considerable charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder will have one other advantage over O'Brien. At least we know he's 
ready.

SWEETWATER STILL HAS A SONG FOR WOODSTOCK; POP MUSIC: THE FIRST ROCK GROUP TO 
PLAY AT THE ORIGINAL FEST WANTS TO BE INVITED TO ITS REBIRTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY NEVINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Nevins lives in Laguna Beach and 
won't be going to Woodstock '94. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That sweltering Friday afternoon, Richie Havens sang, the Swami Satchedenada 
chanted, and then Sweetwater dealt with the squawking, archaic sound system and 
cranked out a sweaty 45-minute show. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, we were the first rock group to play at Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 We were first to stumble innocently across the black cables scattered insanely 
around the makeshift stage, and first to struggle to maintain eye contact 
across the plywood expanse. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, clutching gear and instruments, we were first to struggle up and down 
the slippery green hill backstage, hoping to catch a helicopter. We were first 
to make our way back to real life after the helicopter ran out of gas and 
dumped us onto a tiny, deserted airport runway in the hot country blackness of 
Upstate New York. Whooping and partying, Woodstock revelers tramped by in the 
dark woods, while perplexed Sweetwater sweated it out that late Friday night, 
listening to the happy, anonymous voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally back at the motel, we were first to collapse from exhaustion, and then 
first to return to L.A. to tell our friends and mothers about entertaining the 
great swaying pasture of glistening hippies, stunned under the sun and stars by 
the spontaneous, rainy apocalypse of Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 But does anybody remember us? 
</P>
<P>
 There were posters with our name on it. We received some press. We're in books 
about Woodstock. We even created a modest scandal after our set when our flute 
player, Albert, battered the Holiday Inn entrance overhang by driving the 
U-Haul truck into it. 
</P>
<P>
 So does anybody remembers us? 
</P>
<P>
 With preparations under way to celebrate Woodstock's 25th anniversary and rock 
acts being recruited from everywhere ('60s veterans and '90s stars alike), with 
tons of media coverage and the attendant philosophical debate about combining 
authentic Woodstock with elaborate hotel/airline packages and cellular phones 
on site, with all this and more, does anybody remember us ? 
</P>
<P>
 Eyes glaze when challenged, "Sweetwater, three albums, Warner Bros.' Reprise 
Records, remember?" Sometimes, the hippest (usually oldest) say, "Oh, 
you-guys-were-great. What happened?" 
</P>
<P>
 What happened indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer may be that most of us left after our set, forsaking the mud and 
the photo ops with other performers. Or maybe it was the forgettable sound 
system we tested for Hendrix, the Who and Joplin's fabulous shows to come. 
Maybe it was our management (actually called Shady Management), or maybe it was 
the temperament of Martin Scorsese, then editor of the "Woodstock" film, who 
left us on the cutting room floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we seemed too weird with seven eclectic instruments and no regular 
electric guitarist. After three technologically primitive '60s albums, maybe it 
was the missing, magical hit that defeated us. Maybe it was our jazz-rock 
vision, too fragile to survive the stormy, disco'd '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it was that drizzly December evening, four months after Woodstock, 
when a drunk driver made an accordion out of my Buick, leaving me, the lead 
singer, with one working vocal cord and petit mal seizures for the next 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Be it bad luck, the gods, whatever. The point, Woodstock, is that any group 
can come back when they've had a lot of hits. We want to come back because we 
belong to you. 
</P>
<P>
 We are you, Woodstock.  
</P>
<P>
 We survived. Well, some of us survived. Sweetwater has stood over the coffins 
of its drummer, its cellist, its flutist. And we've lost track of our 
sometimes-guitarist. But the rest of us still make music. 
</P>
<P>
 We survived aging, job loss and parents dying. We became teachers, builders, 
artists. When another band came along and used our name, we survived that, too. 
Now we pay taxes and we realize that the immortal feelings of 20-year-olds 
equal the illusions of the Establishment we once attacked so religiously. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we shake our heads over really new music and we don't easily 
understand change like we used to, but we still dream, even though our own 
angry children sometimes call us foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 We survived the cultural mayhem: the gurus, the discos, the demise of vinyl 
LPs, the greed, the Me-ism, the schemes of the '80s; screaming activists and 
presidential tomfoolery; acquiring and losing our fortunes; designer drugs; the 
New Age and our past lives; the movies, the issues, the wars, the 
guns-riots-floods-fires-earthquakes; the programs and the addictions of 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of everything, we made good on our baby-boomer lives. Not always as 
we thought we should, but we did. We're still here believing in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 We create each day, although sometimes we creak a little. We have gray 
hair/thinning hair/no hair and our waistlines have expanded. But like the best 
of our '60s dreams, we stayed the same while we grew, and as America approaches 
a new century, we will be her rock 'n' roll grandparents and 
great-grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 We are all Woodstock with our clashing lusts for parties, children, money, 
God, simplicity, sameness, newness, fashion and truth. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sweetwater, like classic hippie/boomers, would love to bring our hope, our 
new drummer and our new music to the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 There's much to sing about. 
</P>
<P>
 We just don't want to go on first, OK?

WARNERS GIVING 'BORN KILLERS' A LIGHT PROMOTIONAL TOUCH; MOVIES: THE STUDIO IS 
DOWNPLAYING THE FILM'S NONSTOP VIOLENCE IN ADS, AND SOME EXHIBITORS PREDICT A 
SHORT RUN. FOR OTHERS, THE TITLE ALONE IS A TURNOFF. 
</P>

 "Natural Born Killers" may be unfurling on the silver screen on Aug. 26 with 
all the gore its name implies, but Warner Bros. is only cautiously hyping its 
violent content and satirical message in movie trailers, TV and print ads and 
bus-stop billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Cautious is the operative word, since Warners doesn't want to appear overly 
zealous in taking advantage of the media frenzy -- similar to the one in the 
film -- that surrounds the murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 And in fact, while director Oliver Stone's parody alludes to some of the 
Simpson coverage in his film, the movie's marketing campaign avoids it 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at the studio say that there are several reasons for the relatively 
low-key approach. Some say the Warners brass is still queasy about releasing 
the film because of its nonstop violence. Others, including competitors and 
some exhibitors, believe that the film will have a short run at best because of 
its violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Friedman, Warners president of worldwide advertising and publicity, 
declined to comment on naysayers' predictions and said that studio executives 
are completely behind the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "This movie speaks for itself. The violence in this film is meant to be 
satirical," says Friedman. "And we never intended to trivialize the message in 
this movie by sensationalizing it. We believe this movie really has something 
important to say." 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which stars Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr. and 
Tommy Lee Jones, is about a serial-killer couple (Harrelson and Lewis) and a 
contemptible talk-show host (Downey) who interviews the country's most vicious 
killers for his tabloid show "American Maniacs." The satire is supposed to 
target the media's insatiable appetite -- in this case, Downey's show -- for 
broadcasting violence, desensitizing its viewing public to horror and making 
heroes out of murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman dodged specifics on the marketing of Stone's message. But one Warners 
source said that the studio decided to get a three-week jump on pushing the 
movie "because it's a unique property that has to be handled in a unique way." 
</P>
<P>
 Translated, says another, "that means handle gently and build momentum as best 
you can in a crowded summer, because this one may very well blow up in your 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 One source involved in the film called the trailers and TV ads "cartoonish. 
It's almost as if Warners was trying to mask how violent this movie is by 
downplaying it the way they did in the ads. You can't really tell what the 
movie is about." 
</P>
<P>
 Not true, say those in Stone's camp. The director, vacationing in Asia, could 
not be reached, but reportedly signed off on the campaign, which highlights the 
satire. Stone has had his differences with the studio in the past, primarily 
over cutting 64 violent scenes to get an R rating. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the cuts, some exhibitors think that the movie is a tough sell. 
For some, the title alone is a turnoff. "It's no date movie," adds one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that some exhibitors have said they don't like the movie and are 
predicting that it will come and go fast," says John Krier, head of Exhibitor 
Relations. "But people should wait and see. Warners generally knows what 
they're doing and they have a good relationship with exhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "And even if it is true that they are nervous about the movie, they would 
stand behind it and never reveal it," he notes. "Besides, they are known for 
being willing to take a loss to keep their relationships. And Oliver is one 
relationship they would want to keep."

SENIORS IN THE INDUSTRY STRATEGIZE FOR HOLLYWOOD JOBS; MOVIES: CONDEMNING 
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SEASONED OLDER PROFESSIONALS, WRITERS, DIRECTORS AND 
ACTORS MEET TO FIND AN OUTLET FOR 'MATURE' PROGRAMMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSANNE GAYLE HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unprecedented move to curb the discriminatory hiring practices they say 
have left most actors, writers and directors over the age of 40 unable to earn 
a living in Hollywood, senior members of the creative community are plotting to 
send a simple message to the industry: They want to go back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 representatives from four talent guilds met recently to challenge the 
entertainment industry's obsession with youthful programming by developing a 
strategy that will not only create jobs, but prove they are a creative force to 
be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 The brainstorming session netted a threefold agenda: 
</P>
<P>
 * to study the feasibility of producing their own hourlong dramatic radio 
anthology series; 
</P>
<P>
 * to do the same for a cable TV anthology series; 
</P>
<P>
 * to seek out one or more partners whose commercial interests ight compel them 
to create a cable channel that would carry "mature" programming exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not ready to sit in the park and feed pigeons," Reva Rose, chairman of 
the Writers Guild Age Awareness Committee, told her peers from the Screen 
Actors Guild, the Directors Guild and AFTRA. "There's too much talent and 
experience in this room for us to give up now." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee hopes the production-oriented plan will succeed where their last 
two efforts -- a lobbying visit to the nation's capitol and a documentary film 
on age discrimination -- fell short of achieving significant results. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for 
Communication, jointly funded by AFTRA and SAG, found that visibly older people 
almost never appear on television -- from virtually no representation on the 
youth-oriented Fox network and 1% on cable and daytime serials, to about 2% in 
prime time. And, as the characters age, they lose their importance, value and 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar University of California report, commissioned by the WGA, found that 
the number of writers over the age of 50 working in TV and feature films 
declined from 24% to 17% between 1982 and 1991. There was, however, one bright 
spot: Employment of writers in their 40s rose with the aging of the Baby 
Boomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the study found, older writers are less likely to write for situation 
comedies than for dramas and TV movies, and are hired less frequently for 
network than for syndicated or cable series. Writers over 50 are practically 
absent from Fox network series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here to gripe and complain, but to make things better by taking 
concrete action," says Tom Blank, a DGA member who attended last week's 
meeting. In fact, Blank adds, while they may fault a seemingly youth-biased 
business, other economic factors have contributed to the unemployment of older 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
 With lead actor salaries and other costs skyrocketing in recent years, 
production companies have had to make sacrifices to achieve the elusive profit 
margin -- and stay in business. In such pressured times, some producers are 
more inclined to simply get the job done than to concern themselves with the 
employment mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "When times are good, producers like to put everyone to work," says Blank. 
"But in this economic downturn, minorities -- blacks, women, the older 
professionals -- generally have a tougher time." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, if California can retain its prominence as a production center, the 
employment outlook will be more favorable for these groups. But if U.S. film 
companies continue their exodus to Canada -- to take advantage of its financial 
incentives -- the existing threat to the U.S. talent pool will intensify. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1993, the U.S. did $1.5 billion worth of its entertainment production in 
Canada," Robert Schneider, who chairs the Immigration Committee of the DGA, 
said in a separate interview. "That amounts to 350,000 work days Americans 
won't have and that's a conservative estimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Another threat to the senior work force is non-union production, where 
film-school graduates willingly pay their dues by working for minimal 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, Rose of the WGA told the gathering of her colleagues 
"we're here to take destiny into our own hands." After a spirited exchange of 
horror stories, including an older writer who said he had an easier time 
getting work when he was on the McCarthy blacklist, the group turned to a more 
sober examination of the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial question was whether to target program content, convincing 
producers to stop reinforcing the negative stereotypes that characterize older 
adults as cranky, inflexible, senile and sexless. Or to tackle -- head on -- 
what these activists perceive as unfair labor practices. Most agreed that the 
two areas were interrelated and that both needed to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Steering the discussion to program content, Alice Backes, longtime actress and 
chair of AFTRA's National Seniors Committee, spoke about demographics. 
Acknowledging that TV is primarily a sales medium, the general agreement was 
that a marketing effort could be made to ensure that ad agency executives don't 
underestimate the buying power of America's older population. 
</P>
<P>
 A UCLA study indicates that in addition to owning 77% of all U.S. financial 
assets, people over 50 control 42% of the nation's discretionary income and 
spend about one-third of it in the marketplace. But while the ad industry does, 
in fact, recognize the influence of senior consumers -- commercials are the one 
area where minorities and older professionals have made great strides in recent 
years -- AFTRA's Backes and others believe they should actually sponsor more 
programming with mature themes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course the income is important to us," says Backes. "But creative people 
-- irrespective of age -- also want to keep doing what they love."

'TRUE LIES' ' FALSE LESSONS IN HISTORY; MOVIES: THE ACTION FILM HAS TAKEN FLAK 
FOR ITS DEPICTION OF ARABS. BUT WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT ITS PROPS WOULD CAUSE A 
STIR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Arab American organizations and Muslim groups have expressed a variety of 
objections to what they see as stereotyping of characters in Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's "True Lies." And if there were more active groups representing 
historians and archeologists, there might have been an outcry from them as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Smith, a research associate of the Institute of Archeology at UCLA who 
teaches courses in ancient Near Eastern history and archeology and Egyptology 
for UCLA Extension, for example, found himself getting steamed during a recent 
screening of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith took exception to the knowledge, or lack thereof, displayed by an 
antiquities dealer played by Tia Carrere. In one scene, she shows 
Schwarzenegger artifacts, including a winged bull door entrance carving, that 
she has been able to surreptitiously steal from their home countries: "You see, 
a lot of these pieces are from ancient Persia," she tells Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast, said Smith: "I thought, no, those look Assyrian."  
</P>
<P>
 Not only were there cultural differences between the two regions, but Carrere 
was off about 300 years by referring to the art, especially the winged bull, as 
Persian, Smith said. The Assyrians used winged bulls to flank doorways of major 
buildings to ward off unwanted intruders. They were introduced by the Assyrian 
king Ashur Nasirpal, who reigned from 883 to 859 BC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect that the Nasirpal prototype was the one used for the movie," 
Smith said of the winged bull, a large example of which was found in the 1800s 
in what is now modern Iraq, formerly Mesopotamia, where the Assyrians lived. 
The Persians lived in what is now Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Lightstorm Entertainment, which produced the movie, said the 
Carrere character is not specific about which of the antiquities -- in a room 
full of them -- are Persian. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's production designer, Peter LeMont, who is currently working on the 
17th James Bond movie, "The Golden Eye," said that "we took a bit of artistic 
license" and made the bulls look "more like horses." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of a horse, however, never entered Smith's mind. "They did a good 
job of imitating (the original)," Smith said. "But someone went to a book and 
found the pictures. So they must have known what they were making. It was odd 
that they didn't mention Assyria."

BROADCASTS ON TAP FOR TOUR BY PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Live television and radio broadcasts in Britain and Finland will mark the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic's European tour that begins Aug. 27, it was announced at a 
press conference Thursday afternoon. The orchestra, led by its music director, 
Esa-Pekka Salonen, will open its tour at the Helsinki Festival in Salonen's 
native city. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be two performances in Finland, the second on national radio and 
television. The 11-city, 14-concert trip -- the Philharmonic's first European 
tour with Salonen other than residencies at the Salzburg (1992) and Lucerne 
(1993) festivals -- will continue with three performances in London and 
Birmingham, England, where it will appear live on BBC television and radio. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Helsinki and the London Proms at the Royal Albert Hall, the 
Philharmonic also will play at the festivals of Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt, 
as well as in Amsterdam, Cologne and Dusseldorf. The orchestra will return to 
Los Angeles Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra's performance in Berlin, one of three special events presented 
by the Berlin Festival to mark the departure of Allied troops from the city, 
will be its first there since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour repertory is highlighted by the late Witold Lutoslawski's Symphony No. 4, 
commissioned for the L.A. Philharmonic, and given its premiere at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion in 1993 with the composer conducting. The repertory also 
includes symphonies by Bruckner, Elliott Carter, Hindemith and Sibelius. 
Pianist Emanuel Ax will appear as soloist with the orchestra in London, 
Birmingham and Amsterdam in Mozart's D-minor Concerto, K. 466.

BEAT OF THE CANYON; TOPANGA SHOP OWNER'S AFRICAN DJEMBE DRUMS HAVE GAINED A 
REPUTATION FOR QUALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; R. Daniel Foster writes regularly

<P>
 In a town built on anomalies, this one harbors one cottage industry that's put 
together more oddly, and noisily, than most: African Percussion, an African 
drum-making shop run out of two trailers perched far up Old Topanga Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Paulo Mattioli, an Italian who hails from Madison, Wis., steps out of 
one trailer, looking like an African version of New Age musician Yanni. Within 
minutes, he rolls a djembe drum from a trailer and sends a primal beat tumbling 
down the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mattioli, 37, is riding a surge of interest in drum-playing that began about 
three years ago, fueled by the music of Paul Simon, Sting, and the New Age and 
men's movements. That was about the time Mattioli moved from Encinitas to 
Topanga to set up shop. His business has been building momentum ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattioli's drumming CD, Master of the Forest, was recently released, and his 
instructional video, West African Djembe Drumming, was called "one of the best 
videos we've seen this year" by Drum! magazine. A dozen of Mattioli's drums 
were recently purchased by the popular West African dance and drum troupe, Les 
Ballets Africains. 
</P>
<P>
 Across town, Mattioli's Expression Sessions, a drumming and dance workshop 
held in Santa Monica on Sunday nights, has doctors, accountants, waiters and 
housewives beating out existential Angst in a drum circle that often grows to 
70 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to have a feeling of being a part of a community," said Mattioli, 
who started drumming at age 6 when his father brought home a set of congo drums 
from Mexico. "Drumming gives people a feeling of incredible joy as they root 
themselves in the beat." But before others make the skins speak, Mattioli has 
to build the instruments. His apprentice, Jim Costa, now does most of the work, 
since Mattioli operates other facets of African Percussion. The business crafts 
mostly djembe drums, instruments that were originally used by the Mandingo 
people in the West African Mali empire, which dates to the 12th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "The djembe has become popular because it's easy to call distinctive tones out 
of," said Mattioli, who graduated in 1988 with a degree in ethnomusicology from 
UC San Diego. "You can get a high accent tone by beating the edge, and a deep 
bass tone from the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 The drum, with its wide head and body shaped like a wine goblet, compresses 
sound and then amplifies it through the megaphone-shaped base, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people want to see if we have a hidden microphone in the bottom," said 
Mattioli. "They can't believe the sound coming from inside the drum." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattioli began making drums 12 years ago after he grew exasperated with a 
poorly built djembe that he took apart and reassembled. He began making the 
instruments from scratch, starting with whole logs that he carved up with a 
chain saw. Now, Costa uses a lathe to work the wood, usually Chinese or 
Siberian elm from the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 After the rudimentary shape is formed, carving and sanding is done by hand, 
using a mallet and chisel. The wood is rubbed with Danish and linseed oil and 
is cured in a climatically controlled chamber. Goatskins, imported from Africa, 
are stretched over the top. (Mattioli said domestic goatskins produce a thin 
sound since American goats are fed a diet high in hormones, which produces too 
much fat.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cords, which are crossed and knotted in a web that stretches to the middle of 
the drum, are looped through a ring that is placed over the head. 
</P>
<P>
 One drum, priced from $150 to $695, takes about two months to build. African 
Percussion creates about 50 drums each month. Most are sold by the national 
chain Guitar Center and by North Hollywood-based Remo Inc., the world's largest 
maker of drumheads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hand drums have become a very popular business, and the demand is increasing 
all the time," said owner Remo Belli, who introduced the synthetic drumhead in 
1956. "We started carrying djembes two years ago because everybody's asking for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattioli's product has a reputation nationwide, even in Africa, where drum 
troupes have chosen his product over their country's own drums, said Steve 
Beck, executive director of the Lawton, Okla.-based Percussive Arts Society, 
which has 6,500 members in 50 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The products he enters and brings to our annual convention are really 
high-quality," said Beck. "People ask for his djembe drums because they've 
heard of the sound they produce." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattioli, in fact, said he believes the djembe has become the drum of choice 
for percussion enthusiasts. "It produces a very powerful sound that's also 
passionate and sensual," he said. "Djembe has been called the magical, or 
healing, drum, because no one can resist its sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the rhythms we have today have evolved from the West African rhythms, 
and the djembe is one of the oldest instruments from that part of the world. 
For a drummer, it's the wellspring, the richest source of all rhythms." WHERE 
AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: African Percussion is open by appointment only. (818) 591-3111. Or 
write: 115 S. Topanga Canyon Blvd., Topanga, CA 90290. 
</P>
<P>
 Also: Expression Sessions are held at Westside Academy of Dance, 1711 Stewart 
St., in the Richlar Center, Santa Monica. Formal drum instruction begins at 5 
p.m. and costs $10. At 6 p.m., a community drum circle, $9, is open to all 
skill levels. African dances are incorporated with the drumming at 7 p.m.

PLAYING OUT THE PAST; CASTING ACTORS AS YOUNG AND OLD TOM IN 'THE GLASS 
MENAGERIE' PROVIDES DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having two actors play the same role is not a new idea. There have been 
productions of "Hamlet" with two Dark Princes. There have even been productions 
of Tennessee Williams' "The Glass Menagerie" with one actor playing the older 
Tom Wingfield, who narrates the play, and a younger Tom living out the older 
man's memories. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's always a fascinating idea, and director Heidi Helen Davis is making 
full use of the concept in the production of "Menagerie" opening this weekend 
at The Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and "Menagerie" have a long history with the Theatricum. In 1975, 
"Menagerie" was the first non-Shakespearean play -- and, through a special 
arrangement with the playwright, the first Williams play -- the theater staged. 
Since then they have done "Night of the Iguana," "The Two-Character Play" and 
"Suddenly Last Summer." Last season, director Davis staged a highly acclaimed 
"A Streetcar Named Desire" in the theater's forest glen amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of Williams' plays are drawn from his own experience, "Glass 
Menagerie" is the most forthrightly autobiographical. The bitter, obsessive 
mother, Amanda, was closely patterned after Williams' own mother. The daughter, 
Laura, was a sad, lyrical image of the playwright's sister Rose, and of course 
son Tom was Williams. He even used his own real first name. 
</P>
<P>
 To use a much-abused phrase, the Wingfield (Williams) family was more than 
dysfunctional. Amanda was the Southern belle whose naive dreams were shattered 
by a marriage to that other Southern stereotype, the loser-wastrel. She took it 
out on her poetic son, and most tragically on the daughter who was a carbon 
copy of her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that Williams writes about in most of his plays," says director Davis, 
"comes out of the basic dysfunction that he experienced, and that a lot of us 
experience. The other night, one of the actors said that Amanda doesn't seem 
like such a bad person. How could she have produced such emotionally crippled 
children? And yet in every single scene in the play, there's an incident with 
Tom or with Laura where great emotion needs to be expressed. And Amanda stops 
it. She either stomps on it, denies it or belittles the person for having it. 
And by the time you're 20, of course, you've been stuffing it all those years." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Davis, who studied at San Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre, was 
familiar with Williams' work but had not worked on his material herself until 
the Theatricum's artistic director, Ellen Geer, suggested she direct 
"Streetcar." As a director, Davis had for some time been delving into personal 
research on family systems and dysfunctional psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis says she doesn't want to hit the audience over the head with it, because 
Williams' writing is so subtle. But she wants the audience to see that they can 
look at Amanda and see what happens when we do this to children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all had this done to us on some level," Davis says. "I see my mother in 
Amanda. There's a part of many women in her, maybe the majority of women, bits 
and pieces. The controlling, the punitiveness, the denying. Women are very much 
like men. They're just taught to express things differently. I don't think one 
is any more worse off, or subject to evil, than the other. And Laura embodies 
what Amanda demands. She has enabled her mother to have somebody to completely 
control, to blame for her lousy life." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was son Tom who was able to fight his mother, able to break free. 
Having two actors play the role is an idea Williams would probably have liked. 
The younger Tom, played by Brian Morri, is living through the hell created by 
his mother, and the father who abandoned them. 
</P>
<P>
 Morri says, "I can sit back and watch the older Tom's big monologues, and to 
see his perception of where 'we' are after 20 years. I get to see the end 
result through someone else's eyes. My resources are built up. We watch each 
other very closely. He's looking back on a situation, a very painful one, and 
to him it's not all black and white. It's not that simple. And I was just part 
of that. Hopefully I'm able to reverse time, and reverse his insights and show 
a different side of that coin." 
</P>
<P>
 James Lefebvre, who plays the older Tom, agrees. "That's the most striking 
thing," he says, "being able to look at who I am at an earlier point. I'm not 
as involved in that earlier moment, when all I saw was how I was being 
thwarted, my life being smothered by this woman. In retrospect I have a 
completely different take on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Geer plays Amanda. Geer says Williams "understands the dark side of 
human nature. Especially in today's world, I find that people need to have a 
catharsis because we're so covered up. It's fascinating for people." WHERE AND

THEATER REVIEW; CREDIT 'PULL' FOR DISPLAY OF BRAVERY; BEFORE AN AUDIENCE OF 
THREE PATRONS, THE NINE PERFORMERS CARRY ON WITH THE SHOW ABOUT A TROUBLED 
WOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Among smaller theaters, one of the peculiar risks of the business is 
performing a play before an audience that is outnumbered by the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a daunting prospect for theater people, and it happens more often than 
you realize. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's not always rotten luck or bad promotion. On occasion, when 
nobody shows up at the theater it's just possible that the play is too dreadful 
to pull in anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case with "The Cosmic Pull" at the West End Playhouse. Playwright 
Deborah Mancini is dramatizing what appears to be an autobiographical trauma -- 
a daughter overcoming, with the help of God, a nervous breakdown and a 
dysfunctional family. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is the kind of sophomoric, self-inflated indulgence that first-time 
writers, which Mancini is, are prone to write. But Mancini further aggravates 
the problem by casting herself as the protagonist, a troubled young woman who 
in search of her childhood screams at her alcoholic mom (the droopy-faced 
Tiffany Henshaw) and her wimpy knucklehead of a father (the colorless Lani 
Smith). 
</P>
<P>
 The experience is undiluted torture for theatergoers, who must also endure an 
intermission. Imagine what it must be like for the actors, who are all 
embarrassing to watch, burdened with material that flirts with lesbian 
yearnings, a long-lost twin sister, a mental hospital and Christian redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 But give the actors credit. At the evening we attended, the performers all 
endured until the end, all nine of them, before a total of three patrons 
(including one reviewer), not counting the house manager and associate 
producer, who padded out the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Who directed this mess? The name is hard to find, but it turns out to be 
Pamela Hall, who earlier did so well directing an entirely different kind of 
show, the musical "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, Hall got in a squabble with the "Cosmic Pull" producers (we 
can't imagine why) and asked that her name be taken off the program, which it 
was. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, the production has managed to survive five weeks. "Listen, one 
night we had 25 people here," boasted the house manager. 
</P>
<P>
 It must have been friends-of-the-cast night. Where and When

LINKS TO THE PAST; DARLENE NGUYEN-ELY'S LARGE SCULPTURES DRAW INSPIRATION FROM 
HER MEMORIES OF VIETNAM. 
</P>

<P>
 The art of Darlene Nguyen-Ely is a mix of nature and industry, of old and new, 
a clash of cultures with roots reaching back to the final days of the war in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Her large sculptural works are dynamic constructs of wood, concrete, bamboo, 
steel and wire, all scattered elements pieced together in an effort to 
reconcile her childhood in Vietnam with her present life in the United States. 
"It's a theme that basically dominates everything I do," says Nguyen-Ely, 28, 
whose solo exhibition runs through Aug. 26 at the Creative Arts Center 
Municipal Gallery in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen-Ely was only 8 when she escaped Saigon in 1975 with an uncle, brother 
and sister, but memories from her homeland remain a key influence on her work. 
The 15 pieces from her "21st Century Tribal Series" now at the gallery are 
abstract in overall design, but made of materials that represent older 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, one corner of the gallery is devoted to Nguyen-Ely's earlier 
"Shrine Series," a trio of smaller works that reflect her memories of the 
religious icons she saw destroyed in the war. These works are built of steel, 
wood and bone, incorporating crosses, religious icons and other found objects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a renewal," she says of the works. "Something that was dead and tossed 
out is made into something new." 
</P>
<P>
 For gallery director and curator Claude Hulce, the "Tribal Series" offers an 
"inventive use of materials. . . . It's definitely unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Arts Center Director Carol Finkle adds that she is "impressed with the 
strength of her pieces. It's fairly unusual for a woman to do such massive art 
pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall design of the work I learned" in the United States, Nguyen-Ely 
says of the avant-garde nature of her sculpture, created in the Long Beach 
studio she shares with her husband, commercial artist Paul Ely. "I'm very much 
influenced by the contemporary art around me." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet her interest in art emerged years before she left Vietnam. Nguyen-Ely was 
often too shy as a child to wander outside to play with other children, 
preferring instead to make small sculptures indoors. Her mother finally hired a 
private art tutor to visit several days a week, and young Nguyen-Ely won a best 
of show prize at a 1974 children's exhibition in Saigon sponsored by UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
 But all her early artistic efforts were left behind when her family became 
refugees the next year, landing in Hong Kong for a year, before being allowed 
into the United States. Rather than join the aunt who already lived in Burbank, 
Nguyen-Ely and her family were compelled by the U. S. government to move to the 
East Coast. They settled in the small steel town of Lebanon, Pa., staying for 
nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I walked down the street, people looked at me," she remembers, a 
long dark braid hanging over one shoulder. "People thought I was Chinese and 
knew kung fu. When the teacher called my name, everyone would turn around to 
look. I was so embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 The family finally moved to Burbank, where Nguyen-Ely attended John Burroughs 
High School. (Her mother arrived in the United States only three years ago. Her 
father, now divorced, lives in Europe.) Nguyen-Ely later studied art at Cal 
State Long Beach and found inspiration in an exhibition by sculptor Ron Pippin 
in the mid-1980s, work that reflected a concern with spirituality, using 
assemblage and found objects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I responded right away because that's what I do," she says. "It really 
encouraged me to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen-Ely was recently interviewed by a Hanoi art magazine and by the Hong 
Kong-based Asian Art News, but she has not returned to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the future, I would like to visit Vietnam and see the artists there, see 
what they do and what inspires them," she says. "I'd just like to get to know 
them. I want everyone to be friends and open. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to leave the past behind and move on," she says of the bitter war 
that ended two decades ago. "I would rather have peace than war." Where and

DRAWN INTO ART; VIDEOS CAN HELP SPARK CHILDREN'S INTEREST IN A WORLD OF 
CREATING AND EXPLORING. VIEWING ARTISTS AS THEY DISCUSS THEIR TECHNIQUES 'SEEDS 
INSPIRATION,' EXPERT SAYS.

 With budgets universally tight, the wide range of arts programs for children 
that were once offered in the schools, parks and libraries have been cut to 
near-extinction. Although there are some privately funded or for-profit arts 
classes available, they can be tough to find and sometimes expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in addition to classes, it is possible to send out for arts training, 
through art videos designed for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say videos can be useful in stimulating art interest in children 
because what kids need most is to be exposed to real artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Jurey, a professor in the Art General Studies Department at Cal State 
Northridge, says the key factor in selecting an art class for children has 
little to do with materials or setting. He feels that putting children in 
contact with a real artist is enormously valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education in the arts is more and more moving toward having the artists in 
contact with students," he says. Listening to artists talk is essential, he 
says, because they have unique perspectives and points of view on the world. 
"Listening to an artist seeds inspiration," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not essential, says Jurey, that children have live contact with artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Even watching programs on video or television in which an artist is 
interviewed or shown talking while working is of great value, he says. Such 
videos are widely available in bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-video "Behind the Scenes" series (Ambrose Video Publishing Inc., 1992, 
$14.95), funded by a $1.5-million production grant from the National Endowment 
for the Arts, is one example. 
</P>
<P>
 These half-hour videos feature such famous artists as David Hockney, David 
Parsons and Max Roach, discussing how they go about their work. The tapes are 
geared to appeal to children and are hosted by magicians Penn and Teller, who 
use animation and music to better explain what the artists are saying. 
</P>
<P>
 In the video with Hockney, for instance, children can listen and watch as 
Hockney discusses why his art does not always look just like the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 He describes, step by step, how his sketch of a chair reflects to him the way 
the furniture looks as he walks around it, and how his finished work reflects 
the changing view of memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-producer Jane Garmmey says the videos help parents and children realize 
that the arts are not esoteric. "We need to demystify the arts. The idea is to 
get kids to be more open," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 School-age children like to be shown how color, perspective and texture can 
fool the eye -- something the videos do well, using actual experiments to prove 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Bradford, a pottery and ceramics artist who teaches children at 
Everywomen's Village in Van Nuys, says that artists convey the joy they find in 
their work, and typically will allow children the freedom to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my classes, I show the children the basic techniques of how to use clay -- 
the pinching, the rolling -- and then I encourage them to have fun and let go," 
says Bradford, who is also a member of the board of directors of the San 
Fernando Valley Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the value of exposing children to the exploration of art, says Jurey, 
is that it helps children realize their inherent power to create. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our day-to-day reality is so prepackaged by the media, it's real important to 
come into contact with another reality, to see that there are different ways of 
looking at things," he says. Where to Go

 Don Harris wouldn't miss a tournament in which Stealth participated if his 
life depended on it -- which it darned near has. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake repairs can wait while the Rousselet family is on the road watching 
Stealth and Shockwave. 
</P>
<P>
 And Fred Herrera, literally and figuratively, is driven to near-exhaustion 
coaching the North Hollywood Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 What pushes these levelheaded people to the point of craziness? Not their 
jobs. The answer is club sports. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These games are a step up from Little League. In clubs, community athletic 
organizations in which boys and girls 8 to 18 compete year-round in softball, 
soccer and other sports, competition is keener and so is attention paid to the 
honing of skills. Parents pay as much as $500 annually for their children to 
play, many with the hope of landing a college athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 31 club softball teams and nine club soccer teams in the San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. Most clubs have one team, but 
some have as many as four. As the names of some teams -- Spartans, L.A. Force, 
Wild Things -- suggest, no one plays the clubs to fool around. 
</P>
<P>
 That includes adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, there are tournaments darned near every weekend, year-round," said 
Steve Valentine, president of West Valley Soccer Club, of which Shockwave, a 
girls' age 14-and-younger team, is a member. "Kids who really want to play at 
the club level need to be talented and interested. But they also need to have 
strong parental support." 
</P>
<P>
 While players compete with high intensity, many parents, coaches and club 
organizers find themselves demonstrating a similar level of devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene and Leslie Rousselet of Woodland Hills no longer take their family 
camping, and they've sold their boat they used to take water skiing. But this 
family that no longer plays together still stays together -- through club 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren Rousselet, 13, the eldest of four children, plays goalkeeper for 
Shockwave and catcher for Woodland Hills-based Stealth's 14-and-younger 
softball team. Lauren's brothers, Michael, 10, and Stephen, 8, and her 
5-year-old sister Brooke do not participate in club sports. But it's a good bet 
they will someday. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every weekend, the Rousselets happily pack up their van and travel 
en masse to watch Lauren play, often staying overnight in a motel. The kids 
view the trips as mini vacations. Their parents spend time between games 
bonding with other parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make a lot of friends," Leslie Rousselet said. "There are some really 
nice families, really nice kids. We want to go out to dinner with them whether 
we're out of town together or not."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the going can be a grind. 
</P>
<P>
 During one stretch this summer, the Rousselets' itinerary included softball 
tournaments in Ventura, Rancho Cucamonga and Escondido, then a soccer 
tournament in Orange County on four consecutive weekends. Ten days later, the 
family was scheduled to travel to Hawaii for another softball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder that the middle finger on Lauren's right hand has been swollen 
for weeks. But then, so is her mother's monthly planner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a spiral calendar and we go over it and over it," Leslie Rousselet 
said. "Last year, we went crazy with all the stuff we let (Lauren) and all our 
other kids do. I've learned that it can be insanity. Friends tell me we're 
crazy. I get that a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rousselets pay $300 for Lauren's membership in Shockwave and $325 for 
membership in Stealth. That's money that could go toward home improvements. 
Since the Northridge earthquake in January, household chores have piled up 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets expensive and there are, probably, other things we could be doing 
with our money," Rene Rousselet said. "It does cause some conflicts between 
Leslie and me. But we both agree this is something we want to do. And it's a 
short period of time, really, in (Lauren's) life. You can't get this time 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Allegiances to club sports can approach near-fatal attractions. Don Harris, 
Stealth president and coach of the club's 12-and-younger team, almost died on a 
recent weekend trip to Riverside by ignoring nausea and vomiting that began the 
night before a game and lasted well past the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harris, a coach for the past 17 years, wasn't about to miss a tournament 
over a bout with the bug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking of not going because I was ill," Harris said. "But I felt an 
obligation to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Harris headed for a hospital emergency room. Six hours later, 
he underwent emergency surgery for a perforated colon. Doctors told him he had 
risked dying by not seeking treatment sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said that two weeks later he was coaching again. He's scheduled for 
follow-up surgery near the end of summer -- after Stealth returns from Hawaii 
on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Club sports can really grab you," said Sergio Rosenberg, president of L.A. 
Force Youth Soccer Club in Northridge, which has three boys' and two girls' 
teams. "Pretty soon, you're wondering what your real job is: your everyday job, 
or your soccer team." 
</P>
<P>
 Running a club can be like running a small company. Most organizations are 
governed by a board of directors composed of coaches and parents representing 
each team within the club. The board meets regularly to discuss business, such 
as fund raising and planning tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teams enter tournaments in which competition progresses to state and 
national levels. Stealth's 12-and-younger team traveled to Indianapolis on 
Monday to compete in the annual national championship tournament sanctioned by 
the Amateur Softball Assn. of America, the national governing body of amateur 
softball. The team is scheduled to return to California on Sunday, then depart 
for Hawaii two days later for another tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Such lengthy sojourns, some of which extend to foreign countries, do not come 
cheaply, or without the expenditure of some sweat -- much of it off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to paying registration fees that cover the cost of uniforms, 
equipment, insurance and coaches' stipends, parents help finance trips by 
conducting fund-raisers -- raffles, candy sales, car washes, whatever. Some 
clubs also seek corporate sponsorship to help foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Fusion, a 14-and-younger girls' soccer team affiliated with the West 
Valley United Soccer Club embarked on a two-week European tour that included 
matches in Denmark and a visit to Germany. Fund-raising efforts totaled more 
than $43,000 for the trip, about $2,800 per player. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip paid off when Fusion finished first in one tournament and third in 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all decided that it would be a wonderful experience for our kids," said 
Marsha Kavaller, whose 14-year-old daughter, Lauren, plays for Fusion. "We had 
a general meeting of our club and said: 'We've got an idea; let's go with it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing takes a major commitment. Sometimes, it's a commitment just 
to get the kids off to practice." Marsha Kavaller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the North Hollywood Jets, a boys' soccer club with four teams, can 
relate. But thanks to Fred Herrera, the club's president, coach, and 
Jack-of-all-trades, transportation is not a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera regularly chauffeurs players to and from practices and matches, 
driving almost daily across Southland freeways. After one recent practice, 
Herrera shuttled players home to Los Angeles, Pacoima and Northridge before 
returning to his own home in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, 45, a former Jets player, arrives at practice at Van Nuys-Sherman 
Oaks Park with goal posts, nets and duct tape in the back of his van. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred is the Jets," said Marcos Solorzano, 17, of Canoga Park, a three-year 
member. "He's the spirit of the whole club." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the club's players come from low-income families whose parents work 
long hours and have difficulty meeting club costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the Jets, a club "running on a shoestring," is to make 
participation easier, Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration is $28. The club's four coaches, including Herrera, are 
volunteers who also handle organizational responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was brought up in Pacoima, so I know what it was like," said Herrera, whose 
sons, Ryan, 19, and Justin, 17, have played with the Jets. "Everybody here 
helps out. It's hard work, but that's the way we have to do it. We're used to 
doing without the best of everything." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Still, the Jets manage to make regular trips to San Diego, Las Vegas and 
Bakersfield. And club membership is growing. This fall, the Jets plan to field 
a new 10-and-under team. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera shuns credit and maintains that he isn't the only one who makes the 
Jets soar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tip my hat to everyone involved," Herrera said. "There are a lot of Fred 
Herreras around, maybe in different ways or different organizations. I think 
anybody involved in a club is going to make some sacrifices. That doesn't just 
go for us. Everybody's got to give something." Local Contacts SOFTBALL

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: SUITABLE SAVINGS; THE NEW HARRIS & FRANK OUTLET UNDERCUTS 
PRICES AT ITS OTHER MEN'S APPAREL STORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Jan. 17 earthquake demolished the Harris & Frank store in Northridge, 
the menswear chain found itself without a location in the San Fernando Valley 
and also without an outlet store. So it uncovered an almost invisible warehouse 
in North Hollywood and in April opened the Harris & Frank Warehouse Outlet, 
where first-quality men's apparel is sold at deep discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 This is actually an experiment for Harris & Frank. It's a lower-priced 
addition to its six other Southern California stores and an outlet for a line 
of men's sportswear it manufactures under the Alan Stuart label. President 
Fernando Lemus says, "Despite the inconvenient location, the customers are 
coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Suits, sport coats, slacks, sweaters and shirts are on the racks at prices 
that will please any bargain shopper. Sizes run 36 to 50 regular, 39 to 50 long 
and 36 to 44 short. 
</P>
<P>
 In suits and sport coats, there are quality labels such as Le Baron, Hart 
Schaffner & Marx and Crickateer, most tagged at about half the regular retail 
price. A $725 Le Baron suit sells for $399, and a suit from Crickateer that 
sells elsewhere for $325 is marked $162.50. Petrocelli suits that regularly 
sell for $350 are on the racks for $175. 
</P>
<P>
 An all-wool herringbone sport coat by Le Baron regularly sells for $550 but 
here the price is $299. Some handsome coats from Mancillas that you would 
expect to pay $325 for are $259. 
</P>
<P>
 At most stores, popular Jaymar Sansabelt slacks sell for about $60. At the 
Harris & Frank Warehouse Outlet, you can expect a $36 price all the time. At 
the high end, 100% wool Bensol slacks that many stores sell for $150 are $90. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many outlet stores, the inventory is not made up of special purchases, 
but rather the quality goods found in the chain's other stores. It is also not 
a dumping ground for last season's leftovers. Most of the selection is current 
and there are no seconds or irregulars.  
</P>
<P>
 Several racks were loaded with sport shirts of all descriptions -- short or 
long sleeves, silk or cotton, solids or prints. Figure price reductions of 50% 
off retail on the short-sleeved shirts and 60% on those with long sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweater department is particularly impressive, not just because sweaters 
are all about 60% off retail but because the selection is dynamite. The house 
label, Alan Stuart, is very visible, and there are some handsome Saxony 
sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Special orders are taken and some items not usually stocked at the outlet -- 
such as tuxedos -- may be ordered at a discount. A tailor is on the premises 
for fast alterations. 
</P>
<P>
 The storefront does not face the street, making it almost invisible, so look 
for the rather large sign on Coldwater Canyon Avenue, just north of Sherman 
Way. Where to Shop 
</P>

VALLEY VOGUE / CINDY LAFAVRE YORKS; THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT ALL; TRENDS RUN 
FROM OUTRAGEOUS RUBBER DRESSES TO CONSERVATIVE HEMLINES. THE ACTIVE-WEAR LOOK 
IS VERY ACTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, Cindy LaFavre Yorks writes regularly about fashion for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rarely in a fashion season have two distinct approaches to newness been so at 
odds. Trends run wildly across the spectrum, from outrageous rubber dresses -- 
yes RUBBER, break out the heavy-duty antiperspirant -- to conservative, 
knee-length skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most wearable -- and popular -- trends emerging in the San Fernando 
Valley for fall is the active-wear look popularized by New York designers Donna 
Karan and Anna Sui, among others. Fred Levine, who owns two M Fredric & Co. 
boutiques in Sherman Oaks and Studio City and a third active-wear-centered 
store in Encino, says the ultra-sport looks are flying out of the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fleece and French terry two-piece jumpers, dresses, and anything with the 
Adidas-style stripe through it, those are the things that are really selling 
now," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley shoppers looking for rubber and vinyl numbers for fall should 
concentrate on department stores such as Nordstrom to deliver the goods. Even 
the area's high-fashion boutiques such as Buffalo Too in Tarzana say they won't 
be getting them in because they are more of a Westside item. 
</P>
<P>
 The rubber styles aren't limited to skin-tight numbers. A-line jumpers, coats 
and baby-doll silhouettes prevail. But there are just as many breath-hampering 
tank dresses and skin-tight rubber minis around for those less interested in 
swing-line styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying dry will be even harder if the new cropped-mohair sweaters soar to the 
top of the fall must-have list, as fashion experts are predicting. Crushed, 
printed velvet and chenille separates serve as less toasty -- and less 
expensive -- alternatives for Valley fashion types, who will find these looks 
at Nordstrom in Topanga Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of texture is almost as important as its presence. Complementing 
the tactile mohair pieces are silk Charmeuse blouses and satin separates. Most 
frequently, these cropped tops -- occasionally baring a little midriff -- are 
being paired with very short skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Women looking to infuse their wardrobes with some trendiness, without going 
overboard with the "sex kitten" mohair looks, might prefer to indulge in 
menswear-inspired ensembles. The three-piece pantsuit -- a vest, mid-length 
jacket and narrow pant -- is shaping up to be one of fall's most wearable 
looks, says Nordstrom's June Rau, fashion director for the Los Angeles region. 
Other new items ideal for filling out a menswear-style wardrobe: peacoats, 
argyle patterns, plaids and anything that looks polished or preppy. The kilt -- 
a somewhat geographically androgynous garment -- is another of fall's 
possibilities for women who aren't quite ready for rubber. 
</P>
<P>
 As for fall's color palette, icy pastel shades of mint green, lilac and 
lavender are being paired with a new basic -- camel. Black, the other 
long-standing basic, is being paired with ultra-bright shades of fuchsia and 
yellow. Chocolate brown, says Rau, is also resurging. Deep cranberry, scarlet, 
plum and eggplant shades serve as accents to brown, which some are calling the 
"new black." 
</P>
<P>
 The most promising of the tame trends: knee-length skirts that just brush the 
bottom of the kneecap. For fall, such designers as Calvin Klein and Donna Karan 
offered a happy medium between ankle-grazing styles and those that challenge 
office dress codes. Though much ado has been made about whether women will 
really accept the look, Rau says she believes two distinct types of women will 
embrace it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the new length is a good look. A more mature customer who's worn it 
before will probably wear it again, but I also think it will be worn by the 
more fashion-forward customers who are always looking for something new," she 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 One such trendsetter is Kathryn Kostelny of Woodland Hills. The former actress 
and current stay-at-home mom says she's excited about the new lengths. Not only 
is she retrieving some knee-length skirts out of the back of her closet, she is 
anxious to add some new styles to her wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love them, mostly because they are classic and will always be in fashion," 
she says. Classic perhaps, but always in fashion? With the exception of the 
blue denim jeans, such a prediction is a precarious guess at best.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 RAJWEAR'S THE RAGE: The Nehru jacket is back in fashion after two decades of 
obsolescence. For those a bit foggy on what it was, the button-front jacket 
with the stand-up collar was a fixture in the closets of groovy dudes in the 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary incarnations are a natural extension of the popularity currently 
enjoyed by the banded collar shirt, says Jaime Villablanca, senior vice 
president and general merchandise manager for I. Magnin. In the Woodland Hills 
store, as well as other California locales, Villablanca expects the jackets to 
enjoying ever-increasing popularity, moving into the fall season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nehru sport coats are more prevalent than those functioning as components to 
dress suits, with designers such as Donna Karan, Issey Miyake, Calvin Klein and 
John Bartlett offering several styles. Prices for designer Nehru jackets 
average $300 to $400 at I. Magnin. 
</P>
<P>
 Men trying to find this look at lower prices will have a hard time. Because 
the look is so new, more mainstream sources are less willing to gamble on the 
cutting-edge male with a penchant for fashion. So start saving for one now.

THE VICE THAT BINDS; CIGAR SALES ARE ON THE UPSWING AS MORE MEN SHARE A PASSION 
FOR PREMIUM SMOKES. THEY'RE LIGHTING UP AT PRIVATE DINNERS AND CLUBS IN THE 
VALLEY. 
</P>

 All day Saturday, the men come and go, happily sucking on their Partagases and 
Macanudos. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturdays, the Cigar Warehouse in Sherman Oaks is as much a hangout as a 
source for high-end cigars. Men of every age wander the discount cigar shop, 
lovingly examining the burnt sienna offerings in their sweet-smelling cedar 
boxes and querying owner Larry Wagner about spiciness, draw and ring gauge -- 
some of the elements that make for a superior smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the cigar renaissance, San Fernando Valley-style. From Westlake 
Village to Glendale, aficionados are gathering to share their passion for 
premium cigars. They have found a way to circumvent the laws that bar smoking 
in local restaurants and are signing up for cigar dinners in which superior 
stogies accompany every course. A private cigar club with annual dues of $500 
will open soon in Sherman Oaks. And the entire community of puffers is gearing 
up for the Los Angeles-area Big Smoke, sponsored by Cigar Aficionado magazine, 
to be held Oct. 11 in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of a national trend since the mid-1980s, local cigar dinners are evenings 
full of smoke and camaraderie. Vendome Wines & Spirits of Studio City and North 
Hollywood recently held one of its bimonthly events at the Smokehouse in 
Burbank. Seated on the patio, where the smoke mingled seamlessly with the smog, 
50 enthusiasts sat as attentively as schoolboys as a representative of the 
General Cigar Co. reported on the current state of the premium cigar trade, 
which survived Castro's revolution and now thrives in diaspora in the Dominican 
Republic, Honduras and Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
 Such evenings of fellowship are especially dear to people who are routinely 
treated by non-cigar smokers as if they had just burped in church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to smoke about five cigars a day, but now I'm down to one because I'm 
so limited in where I can smoke," said 57-year-old Ken Draper of North 
Hollywood. Like many of the other attendees, all but three of them men, he has 
never been a cigarette smoker. "The quality of the tobacco is really 
different," he said, with a moue of distaste. "They take shavings off the floor 
and sell them as cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 At a nearby table, the new generation of cigar smokers was represented by four 
pals from UCLA. So committed a conservative that he carries a picture of 
Richard Nixon in his wallet, 21-year-old Grady Bourn of Van Nuys said he began 
smoking stogies to emulate talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Friend Geoffrey Repo, 24, of Encino laughed as he recalled his maiden cigar. 
"When I was 11 years old, my parents caught me smoking and, in order to punish 
me, my father made me inhale a cigar." 
</P>
<P>
 Repo and his friends said they figured that the Burbank smoker, which included 
a meal, complimentary cigars and a post-dinner drink of 25-year-old Remy Martin 
cognac, all for $25, was just too good a deal to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful vice," says Richard Carleton Hacker, a 40-something resident 
of Sherman Oaks who is the author of "The Ultimate Cigar Book" (Autumngold 
Publishing, 1993), a guide for the smoking perplexed that has earned him the 
nickname "the cigar czar." 
</P>
<P>
 Often asked to speak at smokers, Hacker offers enthusiasts the specific 
information they hunger for. In selecting a fine cigar, he counsels, inspect 
the outer leaf, or wrapper, for cracks or worm holes. A cigar with a fissured 
wrapper won't draw properly and "will be like smoking a piccolo." Never, never 
store a good cigar in the refrigerator. Ideal conditions for storage are 70% 
humidity and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, like those of the walk-in humidors in cigar 
shops. Besides, cigars are porous, and a refrigerated one "can start tasting 
like your chicken salad or your pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 Hacker also answers the burning question of whether you should take the cigar 
band off your Cohiba or not. Removing it, he says, "is like ripping the emblem 
off a Mercedes. Why would you want to do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 As to the burgeoning cigar mystique, Hacker believes that when you put a 
premium cigar between your lips, "you immediately look like you've made it or 
you're going to make it." In addition to creating an upscale aura, good cigars 
offer a predictable pleasure in a puritanical world. "It's getting harder and 
harder to find a way to enjoy yourself in an increasingly restrictive society," 
Hacker says. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin R. Shanken, whose Cigar Aficionado is the bible of the new cigar 
smoker, agrees. There are 50 reasons for the current cult of the cigar, Shanken 
says, but the bottom line is, "It just feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 Cigar lovers insist that their favorite smoke presents less of a health risk 
than cigarettes because cigars are made without additives and are not inhaled. 
Some also believe that a cigar's ability to reduce stress compensates for the 
dangers associated with exposure to tobacco. "George Burns smokes 25 cigars a 
day and he's 98," Hacker says. But even Hacker wouldn't chew on cigars all day. 
"I preach moderation." 
</P>
<P>
 To give local devotees a place to relax and indulge themselves, Gus' Smoke 
Shop in Sherman Oaks will open a private cigar club next door to its Ventura 
Boulevard store. According to owner Jim Hurwitz, the 800-square-foot facility 
will include such amenities as cable sports, a pool table, card tables and a 
putting machine. Membership will cost $500 a year, and Hurwitz expects to be 
sold out before the mid-September opening. 
</P>
<P>
 The club will be called the Back Room. Hurwitz considered, and rejected, 
calling it the Testoste-room. 
</P>
<P>
 Communal cigar smoking is so hot that Cigar Warehouse has two dinners coming 
up, one Tuesday at Canyon in Studio City and another Aug. 24 at Le Cafe in 
Sherman Oaks. Shop owner Wagner agrees with others that male bonding seems to 
be an integral part of the phenomenon that is boosting the sales of luxury 
cigars by 24% a year.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Only three of Wagner's regular customers are women. If he had to make a living 
from his female clientele, he says, "I would be selling shoes."

 Some customers come to Lose the Blues on Wednesday nights to lose themselves 
in live poetry readings at 8:30, followed by live music until midnight. Others 
find the entertainment a backdrop to the coffeehouse's more important role of 
"home away from home" where one can unwind, talk to friends or study for a 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: A cozy, living-room feel permeates the room, aided by hand-painted 
ceiling tiles designed by customers who feel the urge to add their personal 
touch to the coffeehouse. Whether you choose to sit at a table or nestle into 
one of the sofas in the sitting areas, you may look up and see a portrait of 
Stevie Nicks, Jimi Hendrix or John Lennon, an array of peace signs and words to 
live by, such as: "One day at a time." The walls are accented by framed 
articles written about the coffeehouse and by posters of musicians from the 
Beatles to John Lee Hooker. The menu offers baked potatoes, chili, soup, chips, 
fruit and -- of course -- coffee and tea. There are outside tables in the front 
and back of the club, mostly inhabited by smokers, who are not permitted to 
light up inside. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: "It's a good mix of people here," said A. J. Merrifield of Agoura 
Hills, who said he comes to Lose the Blues every night. "It goes from yuppie to 
grunge, to leftover beatnik." 
</P>
<P>
 THE POETRY: A local poetry group walks to Lose the Blues after its Wednesday 
night meetings to try out new material. Regulars and newcomers take to the tiny 
stage near the entrance and recite in styles from fiery to monotone, religious 
to lines unprintable in a family newspaper. One poet recited his entire 
collection with his back to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Live entertainment is offered nightly, in the form of jazz, rock or 
blues. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: Tom Miner, 22, of Westlake Village came to study for his biology 
final. "I find it more productive here because there's no TV," he said. "The 
music doesn't distract me, and there's lots of caffeine." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: Ventilation is dependent on a ceiling fan and a fan by the door; 
there's no air-conditioning. "It's a little hot in there," said Tricia Carter, 
28, of Thousand Oaks as she stood outside with her cigarette. "But it's worth 
the heat." 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "One time, my friend and I were playing chess here," Merrifield 
recalled. "A huge group of eighth-graders came in and just stared at us. I 
looked at one and said, 'What?' And she said, 'You are soooo rad!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lose the Blues, 28888 Roadside Drive, Agoura, is open from 5 p.m. to midnight 
every night. No cover or minimum. Call (818) 889-8009. CHERIE SAUNDERS

 With its spectacular backdrop of the Santa Monica Mountains, Topanga retains a 
rustic, wild appeal and a hippie, New Age feel. Spend a few hours in the town's

 A word of caution: The town of Topanga may be laid-back, but drivers whiz up 
and down Topanga Canyon Boulevard with ruthless disregard for pedestrians. 
There are no sidewalks and plenty of blind spots, so stick to your side of the 
road, and take care when crossing the street or walking from one point to the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
 11 a.m.: Brunch at Inn of the Seventh Ray will put you in the Topanga mood. A 
romantic New Age restaurant nestled in the Santa Monica Mountains, the inn is 
all gardens, fountains and trees. You can sit indoors near a wood-burning 
fireplace, but if the weather is fine, select an outdoor table near the flowing 
creek, under a blossoming vine or tucked away in one of many secluded nooks and 
crannies. Fresh-faced waitresses in gauzy floral frocks and high-tops keep your 
coffee cup and water glass full. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunch items, priced from $3.95 for cereal to $18.95 for the full buffet, tend 
toward the esoteric, organic and preservative-free. According to the menu, a 
meal here will raise "your body's light vibration of the violet flame." Wow. 
All that for the price of an omelet. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon: By now, you are no doubt feelin' groovy, so stop at the Spiral 
Staircase, a New Age boutique upstairs from the inn. If you are running low on 
incense or crystals, this is the place to stock up. The store also has a good 
assortment of spiritual, self-help and feminist books, as well as gorgeous gift 
wrap that you will swear is hand-painted. 
</P>
<P>
 12:15 p.m.: Walk back to Topanga Canyon Boulevard and turn right, or south. 
You will soon reach the Topanga Center. The General Store is an old-fashioned 
grocery -- a good place to pick up trail mix or fruit if you plan to top off 
your afternoon with a hike in nearby Topanga State Park. You can also buy 
souvenir Topanga T-shirts here. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjacent to the General Store is Sherry's Jubilee, a gift store with more 
Topanga T-shirts. The shop also stocks unusual picture frames and intricately 
carved boxes that are perfect for holding paper clips or storing tiny 
treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop is New Canyon Gallery, an artists' cooperative, with changing 
exhibitions of paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculptures and 
ceramics. Occasionally, the gallery brings in guest singers and transforms 
itself into a coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 12:45 p.m.: Continue south to Topanga Home-Grown, at 137 S. Topanga Canyon 
Blvd. Here, you will find handmade soaps, dried lavender and herbs, fragrant 
oils and various items crafted by local artisans. The children's section has a 
decent supply of environmentally and politically correct toys -- and, of 
course, the de rigueur dinosaurs. More Topanga T-shirts, too, but these are 
tie-dyed. Beginning in late June, locally grown organic produce is marketed in 
front of the store. Handmade and antique rugs are sold at Woven Legends next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 1 p.m.: Turn around and head north on Topanga Canyon Boulevard. Across the 
street is Boubalina, a women's clothing boutique, where you can try on one of 
those long floral frocks favored by the waitresses at the Inn of the Seventh 
Ray. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue up Topanga to Crystals in the Woods. In addition to crystals of all 
sizes, you will find handmade Brazilian tabletops, New Age books, jewelry, 
bookends, angel figurines, wind chimes, and an assortment of other fun and 
funky items made from precious and semiprecious stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in stock are a variety of Native American artifacts, such as smoke 
sticks, which purify the air with the clean scent of sage, or feathered "dream 
catchers," which, according to legend, ensure a peaceful night's rest by 
trapping nightmares. Stop by the store on Thursday evenings to take part in a 
free Meditation Planetary Health Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 1:45 p.m.: Your last stop is Sassafras Nursery at 275 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd. 
Spend a few minutes wandering along the soothing flower-lined paths overlooking 
the creek. Pick up a plant or a packet of seeds to spruce up your garden or 
brighten your kitchen windowsill, and head back to your car. Where to Go

RESTAURANT REVIEW; IN NEED OF FINESSE; COSMOS GRILL OFFERS NICE DECOR AND 
FAMILIAR CALIFORNIA CUISINE MENU. BUT ITS FAILURES CAN BE MAJOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a warm Friday evening, it's standing room only, the front desk at Cosmos 
Grill informs us, for at least half an hour more. 
</P>
<P>
 This recent addition to the West Valley dining scene has been popular from the 
start, filling the void left by the departure of the former occupant, La 
Cuisine de Bernadette. Credit artful style, a cheery outdoor patio and a 
familiar California-style menu for its good fortune. Now what this place could 
use is more finesse. Cosmos Grill pushes most of the proper concept buttons, 
often successfully, but its failures can be major. 
</P>
<P>
 The long, narrow dining room, which features an open kitchen for your 
entertainment, showcases Op Art paintings that somehow manage to be reminiscent 
simultaneously of Van Gogh and Timothy Leary on its earth-tone walls. There are 
comfy fabric booths to sit in, and colored canvas umbrellas to shield out sun 
if you snare a spot on the patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Sifting through a menu of salads, sandwiches, pastas and rotisserie meats is 
something a practiced California grill diner can do in his sleep. But a few odd 
new wrinkles appear on this one. One is something the menu deceptively calls 
shrimp egg roll. Another is the restaurant's eccentric Mediterranean sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 You might bypass the shrimp egg roll because of its mundane-sounding name, 
though the menu description would alert you that there's something unusual 
going on here. As a matter of fact, it would be a pretty good idea to bypass 
this one. Think of it as wacky deep-fried sushi, or a wacky underdone 
chimichanga : a filling of rice, lots of shredded spinach, a few shrimp and 
several halved almonds, wrapped in an egg roll skin and deep fried. Were it 
done perfectly, it might succeed. It isn't, though, and that rice soaks up oil 
like a V-8 engine.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mediterranean sandwich is another creative idea gone astray. It starts 
with good toasted rye bread smeared with a Kalamata olive puree, and I, for 
one, would have been perfectly happy if the kitchen had stopped right there. 
But it goes on to add grilled eggplant, asparagus, roasted red pepper, tomato, 
avocado and Swiss cheese. Tasty on their own, these components confuse the 
palate when they're piled together, not to mention sogging up the bread. 
</P>
<P>
 With California cuisine basics we are mostly on terra firma. There are crunchy 
crab cakes, served astride an appealing red pepper coulis. The fine Cobb salad 
features apple-smoked bacon bits, turkey, avocado and a good blue cheese 
dressing. Artichoke is delicious here, finished on the grill (giving it a taste 
of oak) and served with a sweet sesame oil dipping sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'm glad to say the kitchen is scrupulous about cooking its pastas al 
dente , though one or two of the pasta sauces seem labored. For instance, the 
angel hair pomodoro is a paragon of simplicity, the tomato, garlic and basil 
working magic together. But not the tequila chicken fettuccine -- tomato, 
peppers, cilantro and chicken mixed with pasta and a light cream sauce. If they 
went a little easier on the tequila, the result would make more sense. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find fault with a lot of the main dishes, such as the rotisserie 
chicken, its crisp skin flecked with tarragon. It comes with perfectly cooked 
mixed vegetables and homey mashed potatoes with country gravy, making for 
solid, restorative fare that will please almost anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But the memory of that chicken can be wiped out by something like the stuffed 
meatloaf. It's a bad idea to begin with -- a turkey, spinach and mushroom 
mixture with a mysterious cylinder of dark matter (the stuffing, one supposes) 
in the middle. On top of that, ours came to the table frazzled and dry, tasting 
only of fennel. 
</P>
<P>
 The vegetable stir-fry at least looks good on paper. Indeed, the vegetables 
that have been put in it are themselves quite good -- eggplant, zucchini, 
asparagus, broccoli and various peppers, among other things. But why have they 
all been drowned in a hideously salty mushroom-soy sauce?  
</P>
<P>
 Breads and desserts, provided by Old Town Bakery of Pasadena, are one 
redeeming feature of Cosmos Grill. They are knockout, high-end stuff like 
almond rocca cake, a yellow cake layered with praline butter and chocolate 
ganache and strewn with homemade almond candy chunks on top, where you'd expect 
frosting. Or lemon hazelnut torte, a moon-shaped pie consisting of thin layers 
of meringue with a smooth, lemon hazelnut filling. Where and When

EXXON TO PAY $287 MILLION TO ALASKA FISHERMEN; ENVIRONMENT: THE AWARD IN THE 
FEDERAL CASE, REACHED AFTER 23 DAYS' DELIBERATION, IS TO COVER ACTUAL LOSSES TO 
BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Exxon Corp. was ordered Thursday to pay $287 million in damages to Alaska 
commercial fishermen who argued that the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill severely 
hurt their business. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict, which awarded less than the $895 million sought by the 10,000 
fishermen who work the waters off southeastern Alaska, came in the second phase 
of a massive trial in Anchorage against the nation's largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury made the award after a painstaking 23 days of deliberation. The 
trial, which started May 1, stemmed from the largest civil suit arising from 
the accident in Alaska's Prince William Sound, where the Exxon tanker wandered 
from shipping lanes, ran aground and dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is less than we were asking for," said Brian O'Neill, lead trial counsel 
representing the fishermen. "You wish it would have been closer to $895 
million, but we'll take it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The award covers compensatory damages, or the actual losses suffered by 
fishermen, without interest. The fishermen had argued that the spill resulted 
in lesser harvests of salmon and herring and sent fish prices plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon had disputed the argument, denying that reduced fishing stocks resulted 
from the spill. Exxon had estimated the fishermen's losses at no greater than 
$113 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Thursday, Exxon said it was still studying the verdict. But, it 
added that "the amount Exxon will be called upon to pay is subject to 
adjustment, including a reduction to reflect payments already made by Exxon to 
many of the plaintiffs." 
</P>
<P>
 In a third phase of the trial, which will begin Aug. 22, testimony will focus 
on a demand by the fishermen and others that Exxon pay $15 billion in punitive 
damages. Last June, the jury found that the company's executives and Exxon 
Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood had acted recklessly in the events leading up to 
the accident. That finding set the stage for the punitive-damages phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the fishermen and other plaintiffs prevail in the amount of punitive 
damages they are seeking, it would be the largest such award ever. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cordova, Alaska, fisherman Jim McCune said Thursday's verdict seemed "awful 
low." McCune, a third-generation Alaska fisherman, said the spill has cost him 
between $100,000 and $120,000 since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The roughest years were right after the spill, 1990 and '91, when fishing was 
very restrictive and the prices of salmon went right down into the dumphole," 
said McCune, who is also president of Cordova District Fishermen United, a 
local fishermen's group that is one of the plaintiffs in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Brodie, associate Alaska representative for the Sierra Club in 
Anchorage, said she doubts the verdict will do much to deter accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately," she said, "the main lesson the oil industry learned from the 
Exxon Valdez wreck was to unload the shipping part of the industry, so that the 
next time we have a big spill, it is unlikely to be a deep-pocket corporation, 
which means the victims may have no recourse. . . . I don't believe these 
awards will solve our problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, while the jury was deliberating the fishermen's claims, Exxon reached 
a $20-million settlement with Alaska native groups who are parties to the same 
suit. The groups said the spill damaged their hunting and fishing grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company is also defending itself against similar charges in state 
court, where six Alaska native groups have filed suit seeking roughly $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon says it has paid about $3.5 billion so far in cleanup costs and 
government fines.

GRISHAM DEAL RED-HOT, BUT IT'S NO 'SCARLETT'; MOVIES: WARNER BROS. PAYS $6 
MILLION FOR THE RIGHTS TO THE BEST-SELLING AUTHOR'S DEBUT NOVEL. 'WIND' SEQUEL 
DREW $9 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 John Grisham, the Mississippi lawyer-turned-author whose Southern-based 
thrillers have been transformed into hit movies, has sold his 1989 debut novel, 
"A Time to Kill," for more than $6 million to Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not a record for a book purchase in Hollywood, the sale far exceeds 
the $3.75 million Universal Pictures paid last year for "The Chamber," which at 
the time Grisham had not yet completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest Hollywood book purchase ever was for "Scarlett," Alexandra 
Ripley's sequel to the Margaret Mitchell classic "Gone With the Wind." Producer 
Robert Halmi Sr. paid $9 million in 1991 for the television rights, and CBS 
plans to air "Scarlett" as an eight-hour miniseries this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest deal culminated Wednesday night, when Warner Bros. made the final 
proposal to Grisham's New York agent, Jay Garon of Jay Garon-Brooke Associates, 
and Marti Blumenthal of Writers & Artists in Los Angeles. Under the agreement, 
Arnon Milchan's New Regency Productions will produce the movie and Joel 
Schumacher, currently working on the sequel "Batman Forever," will direct. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, Grisham will also be a producer with a certain 
measure of script control. In addition, the deal calls for a $25,000 
contribution toward construction of a facility for AIDS-stricken babies at 
Grisham's favorite charity, St. Jude's Hospital in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Stephen King, Michael Crichton and Tom Clancy, Grisham has been popular 
with Hollywood, largely because his books have broad commercial appeal and are 
easily translated to the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to buy a tried-and-true concept," said Irene Webb, an agent at 
International Creative Management who helped broker the "Scarlett" deal when 
she was at William Morris Agency in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "They buy another Grisham book because he continues to write successful and 
exciting thrillers," she said. "I think people are willing to spend a lot of 
money for ideas that seem commercial and that will really attract top talent. 
It's not that easy to find good stories." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Time to Kill" -- originally titled "Deathknell" -- is the story of a 
Southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of killing two whites who had 
raped the man's daughter. The story was rejected by 25 publishers until an 
obscure Southern publisher, Mynwood Press, ran off 5,000 copies. It has since 
become a smash bestseller in paperback. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Grisham novel to become a movie was "The Firm," which starred Tom 
Cruise and Gene Hackman. It took in more than $158 million domestically for 
Paramount Pictures last year. "The Pelican Brief," starring Julia Roberts and 
Denzel Washington, was released last December by Warner Bros. and grossed $107 
million domestically. "The Client," starring Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee 
Jones, is currently in release for Warner Bros. and has already brought in 
about $60 million.

WILL SUPPLIERS STRIKE OUT?; BASEBALL'S ANCILLARY BUSINESSES TRY TO COVER ALL 
THEIR BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like an errant player caught in a rundown between bases, the industry that 
supplies everything from hot dogs to uniforms for big league baseball would 
find itself trapped by the players' strike that was set to start today. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be nothing the suppliers could do to recapture their sales to the 
national pastime except wait and hope the walkout is brief. But the strike's 
potential impact on their operations would be decidedly mixed, depending on 
each company's size and what it sells to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Carl J. Shields, the man who literally puts the baseball in Major League 
Baseball. He's chief executive of Rawlings Sporting Goods Co., the Fenton, 
Mo.-based concern that supplies the roughly 720,000 baseballs the big leagues 
use each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Shields, the balls -- along with bats, uniforms and other gear 
that it sells to professional baseball -- account for less than 3% of Rawlings' 
$140 million in annual sales. Besides, this year's balls have already been 
shipped and paid for and now wait in storage at each stadium, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had started in April or May, then you would have had a larger risk," 
Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the strike's imminence has sparked a flurry of predictions about what 
effect baseball's absence would have on the nation's economy. The predictions 
show why economics is dubbed an inexact science: Various forecasters warn that 
a walkout could either cause a damaging ripple effect on cities with pro teams, 
or be hardly felt because fans would merely spend their money elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no disputing that a strike would quickly inflict some damage on 
certain industries and their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Tom Clougherty. He's the marketing vice president of family-owned 
Clougherty Packing Co. in Los Angeles, which makes Dodger dogs and other Farmer 
John brand hot dogs sold at Anaheim Stadium and Jack Murphy Stadium, home of 
the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Clougherty, whose firm sells a combined half-million pounds of hot dogs to 
those parks each year, said he "really couldn't put a dollar amount at this 
point" on what a strike could cost the company. "It has a financial impact, 
although the majority of my sales are retail," he said, noting that baseball 
represents less than 10% of his firm's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I'm more concerned with the people who stand out there" selling the 
dogs to fans, Clougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if any one group strikes out from the game's labor strife, it would be 
the aisle vendors and concession stand workers who hurl the peanut bags and 
pour the beer. 
</P>
<P>
 They would lose their jobs today, although those jobs are secondary sources of 
income for many of the workers, said David Flaherty, a spokesman for ARA 
Services Inc., the giant food services concern that recently assumed management 
of Dodger Stadium's concessions. ARA also provides those services to five other 
big league parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ARA vendors -- there are between 800 and 1,000 at Dodger Stadium and at 
each of the other venues -- work strictly on commission, which typically pays 
them $80 to $100 a night, Flaherty said. The concession stand employees are 
paid a salary of about $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't want to see it (the strike) go more than a few games," he said. 
"We prefer not to see it happen at all." 
</P>
<P>
 ARA itself, a closely held company based in Philadelphia, won't disclose the 
sales that Major League Baseball provides, except to say that it's "an 
important part" of its food and refreshment group, which accounts for about 
half of ARA's $5 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 If a strike drags on, however, "it could have a significant impact on our 
ballpark concessions," Flaherty said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact would be less serious for Anheuser-Busch Cos., the St. Louis-based 
producer of Budweiser, Busch and other beers. The nation's largest brewer won't 
say how much beer it sells at, say, Dodger Stadium or Anaheim Stadium or to 
baseball overall, but it's a fraction of the 87 million barrels the company 
ships annually. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Anheuser-Busch's massive advertising effort, the company's contracts 
with television and radio stations include terms that free Anheuser-Busch from 
paying for ballgame ads that would not appear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not pay for something we didn't get," said Tony Ponturo, an 
Anheuser-Busch vice president for sports marketing. "But we will miss the 
marketing value of those games." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the strike's likelihood prompted Stuart F. Meyer, president of 
the St. Louis Cardinals (which Anheuser-Busch owns), to issue a statement 
Thursday saying that a walkout "would not noticeably affect" the brewer's 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the memorabilia market would definitely feel the impact if the season ends 
for good, said Craig Mankowski, Rawlings' chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rawlings, besides making baseballs for the big leagues' regular season and 
playoffs, also produces specially marked baseballs for the World Series. If a 
strike wipes out the season, that World Series inventory will jump in value, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? The year 1994 is printed on the baseballs (validating a year they would 
not be used), and it's one of the rare years when the ball is not emblazoned 
with a baseball commissioner's name, because the sport currently has only an 
interim commissioner, Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig. Rawlings won't say how 
many of those balls it has in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about all those other baseballs now collecting dust in stadium 
storage bins? Rawlings isn't worried that they'll cut into its sales of 
horsehide next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseballs, Mankowski said, "have a way of disappearing in the off season." 
Hungry Fans Baseball fans, at least at Los Angeles Dodger games, eat hot dogs. 
Lots of them. Because the Dodger dog is such a phenomenon, fans eat at the rate 
of about one dog per person each game, higher than the average for all 
stadiums. Fans here also have big appetites for sodas and peanuts, among other 
things. Here is what ARA Leisure Services, the concessionaire for Dodger games, 
estimates it would have sold for tonight's scheduled game with the Chicago 
Cubs, with what had been an expected crowd of 30,000.

ECONOMY; WHOLESALE PRICES LEAP IN JULY; ALL EYES ARE NOW ON THE FED; 
INDICATORS: MANY ANALYSTS SEE ANOTHER BOOST IN INTEREST RATES WHEN THE BOARD'S 
POLICY-MAKERS MEET NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Wholesale prices surged ahead at their fastest rate in more than a year last 
month, the Labor Department said Thursday, persuading many analysts that the 
Federal Reserve Board will almost certainly raise interest rates again when it 
meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of another rate hike -- which would be the fifth in six months -- 
sent bond yields soaring. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which moves 
in the opposite direction of bond prices, rocketed to 7.65% from 7.57% on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, off nearly 30 points at midday, closed down 
15.86 at 3750.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate government reports showing that retail sales slipped a modest 0.1% in 
July and that first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly last 
week failed to squelch traders' concerns that the Fed will raise its short-term 
discount rate when its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rates are probably going to go up one-quarter or maybe even one-half of a 
point next week," said Charlie Okada, who runs the trading desk at Sanwa Bank's 
Los Angeles headquarters. "Another rate hike is no longer a possibility, it's a 
probability. " 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has already raised rates four times since February in an effort to 
discourage more borrowing by businesses and consumers. Less borrowing results 
in less spending, which slows the economy and dampens inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 0.5% leap in wholesale prices last month indicates that those previous 
rate hikes might not have been enough to get the job done, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 July producer energy prices rose 2.5%, led by a huge 8% increase in the cost 
of gasoline. Food prices climbed 0.5%, fueled largely by a staggering 43% 
increase in wholesale coffee prices caused by killer frosts in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy 
costs, rose only 0.1%. Even so, analysts noted, inflation at the wholesale 
level was running at a 2.2% annual rate through July, compared to a smaller 
1.7% rate for the first seven months of last year -- an increase the Fed may 
find unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the price and inflation data we've been seeing will be the ammo the 
Fed needs to justify raising interest rates," said Robert Dederick of Northern 
Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also said the slight drop in retail sales in July and the modest rise 
in first-time unemployment claims also belied the economy's underlying 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the 0.1% dip in retail sales was led by a 1.7% decline in 
automobile purchases. However, analysts said auto sales didn't drop because 
consumers aren't buying new cars; instead, car lots are being emptied so fast 
that Detroit can't keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Some automobile dealers have long waiting lists for their most popular models. 
Manufacturers are planning price hikes for some of their 1995 models, which 
economists say will worsen inflationary pressures in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 And while new claims for jobless benefits rose to 321,000 last week from 
315,000 the week before, the four-week moving average of claims -- a more 
reliable indicator of overall employment trends -- dropped for the third week 
in a row. Producer Price Index

BUBBLE BURSTS ON FCC AUCTION OF AIRWAVES; COMMUNICATIONS: CONCERNS STEM FROM 
DELAYED PAYMENTS AND LACK OF MINORITIES AND WOMEN AMONG THOSE TO RECEIVE 
LICENSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The euphoria over the rich bids in the federal government's first-ever auction 
of the airwaves is beginning to fade amid bidders' efforts to delay payments 
and concern about the failure of women and minorities to get some of the 
choicest licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The two top bidders in last month's Federal Communications Commission auction 
of licenses for a new interactive TV service failed this week to submit 
deposits to cover the $58.35 million they offered the FCC for 35 licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the firms, Interactive America of Sun Valley, Calif., could not be 
reached. But Commercial Realty of St. Pete Inc. of St. Petersburg, Fla., said 
alleged interactive TV product delays as well as patent litigation over the 
technology, known as Interactive Video and Data Service, forced it to withhold 
payment. The FCC has said it will fine and revoke the licenses of any firm that 
did not submit its deposit by the close of business last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures came as some FCC officials, disappointed by the showing of 
minorities and women, launched an effort to find ways to improve their odds at 
success in future auctions. Late Thursday, the agency was circulating a 
proposal to increase bidding credits for women, minorities and small businesses 
to 40% from 25%, while also considering a plan to delay the next auction by up 
to 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC's auction drew a record $833 million in bids for 10 nationwide, 
two-way paging licenses and 593 IVDS licenses. But no women- or minority-owned 
firm won any of the nationwide licenses. What's more, if Commercial Realty, 
whose majority stockholder is an unidentified woman, is stripped of its 20 IVDS 
licenses, women's share of that category of licenses would drop to less than 
30%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern is that no minorities were among final winners . . . because 
there were no set-asides and they were bidding against" companies with very 
deep pockets, said James H. Quello, an FCC commissioner. Quello said he favors 
revising payment schedules and bidding credits for minorities and women to 
improve their success and bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 David E. Honig, executive director of the Minority Media Ownership and 
Employment Council, a Washington educational group, agreed that rules needed to 
be revised to help minorities and women. But unlike Quello, Honig was also 
sympathetic to big companies that complained they didn't have enough time to 
meet FCC deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should be excused from making payments, but the commission ought to 
allow considerably more time between the end of the auction and the date the 
first payment is due to give people time to" arrange for their financing, Honig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any mid-stream rule changes, however, would face stiff opposition from some 
officials and could potentially delay future auctions and set off an ugly round 
of litigation over the auction process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought very hard for the (bidding preference) rules," said FCC Commissioner 
Andrew Barrett. "I think some companies may have overbid in terms of pricing, 
(but) I am not about to go back and correct what the market has done." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has championed wireless communications technologies 
as a source of more than a million jobs in the next decade as well as a 
$100-billion boost to the American economy. But bickering over the 
controversial auctions -- which could eventually raise more than $10 billion 
for the U.S. treasury -- now threatens to delay any economic payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 One disgruntled license winner, American Personal Communications of 
Washington, has filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals over an FCC decision to 
reverse itself and make so-called "pioneers" of new wireless services pay for 
their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the FCC had voted to give APC and two other companies free 
licenses to offer so-called broad-band PCS. But Wayne Schelle, chairman of APC, 
criticized the FCC in a statement released Wednesday for bowing to pressure by 
competitors who will have to bid for broad-band PCS licenses in auctions to be 
held later this year.

 Manufacturers, Builders Less Optimistic: A Dun & Bradstreet Corp. survey found 
that slower growth in new orders and a reduction in order backlogs in July 
caused manufacturers to lower their expectations for near-term business.An 
economist for the New York-based information company said the results suggest 
that executives will be taking a cautious approach over the next few months. 
The company's July survey of builders found that their expectations also 
declined. Douglas P. Handler said that although optimism about manufacturing 
conditions for the coming three months is now at its lowest level of 1994, it 
is still better than it was during most of last year.

 Hostile Bid Rejected: Toronto-based Lac Minerals said it turned down a 
sweetened $1.74-billion bid from Royal Oak Mines Inc. Vancouver, Canada-based 
Royal Oak had raised its bid to $3.60 in cash plus two of its shares for each 
Lac share, valuing the offer at $12 a share -- a 45% premium to Lac's market 
price before Royal Oak's first bid was made July 7. Lac said it was concerned 
about the value of the stock being offered, the dilution to be suffered by 
stockholders because of the large amount of shares in the bid and the 
debt-heavy balance sheet of a combined company.

Bankruptcy Agency official told the Postfactum news agency: "There is nothing 
terrible in this, either for the firm or for lovers of Stolichnaya." The notice 
covers with liquidity levels at Kristall, but does not mean the company will go

TELECOMMUNICATIONS; SENATE PANEL APPROVES BROAD REFORM BILL; REGULATION: ANGRY 
LOBBYISTS VOW TO SEEK CHANGES IN THE MEASURE, WHICH WOULD BREAK UP PHONE, CABLE 
MONOPOLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A sweeping telecommunications reform measure -- which in its final form 
incensed nearly all segments of the powerful industry -- sailed through the 
Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday as disgruntled lobbyists vowed to seek 
change in the measure on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee approved the bill by an 18-2 vote, with only Republican Sens. 
John McCain of Arizona and Bob Packwood of Oregon voting no. Both senators said 
they agreed with industry representatives that the bill, which would break up 
longstanding cable and telephone monopolies and promises to create more than a 
million jobs over the next decade, imposes too many regulatory burdens. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the committee did make some improvements in the original version . . . 
too many problems still exist in the bill reported today," said Roy Neel, 
president of the United States Telephone Assn., a Washington-based telephone 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The House last month passed its own telecommunications reform bill by an 
overwhelming margin. But the powerful regional Bell companies strongly objected 
to the Senate committee's ground rules for allowing the regional companies into 
the long-distance telephone business -- though they declined in the end to use 
their clout to kill the measure at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the Bells were joined in their protests by some long-distance 
providers, such as AT&T. "We believe language changes should be made to clarify 
the meaning of some of the preconditions," AT&T spokesman Herb Linnen said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which is aimed at stimulating competition in the $300-billion 
telecommunications business and speeding the deployment of futuristic 
Information Age services, is expected to go before the full Senate next month. 
</P>
<P>
 It faces an uncertain fate on the Senate floor. But one committee source 
speculated Thursday that the decisive committee vote could hurt the ability of 
industry lobbyists to amend the bill. Other observers say that because of the 
press of the legislative calendar, time is on the side of those who want to 
delay or defeat the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's bill would allow cable and local telephone companies into each 
other's businesses at the same time -- roughly one year after enactment -- and 
would permit regional Bell companies to offer long-distance service and 
manufacture telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the telephone companies would first have to let the competing cable 
companies and other telecommunications providers hook into their networks. They 
would also be required to sell competitors individual telecommunications 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the regional Bells would be required to set up separate 
subsidiaries for long-distance services. But the Bell companies wouldn't have 
to construct new facilities for such subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollings extended a last-minute olive branch to the Bell companies today, 
Bloomberg Business News reported. He agreed to support an amendment allowing 
Bells that have already been given the go-ahead by states and the courts to 
enter the cable business to proceed without waiting for Federal Communications 
Commission permission. 
</P>
<P>
 That in effect "grandfathers" companies such as Bell Atlantic and US West that 
already have made deals to supply cable services.

 Allstate Checking Applicants' Credit Records: The Hartford, Conn.-based 
insurance company said it is checking the credit histories of applicants for 
new auto policies in at least 36 states to weed out bad risks, a practice 
consumer advocates say could start a trend in the industry.Allstate, the 
nation's second-largest carrier of car insurance, is also considering whether 
to make the credit checks routine for new homeowners policies. New applicants 
with poor credit records may be rejected or offered coverage at higher prices, 
but current policyholders will not be dropped solely because of credit 
problems, the Sears, Roebuck & Co. subsidiary has told regulators. Use of 
credit reports in selecting insurance customers is legal in most states.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS; MCCAW CELLULAR, SOUTHWESTERN BELL HOLD MARKETING TALKS

 McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. has held talks with Southwestern Bell Corp. 
on how to create a more unified national cellular telephone network, a McCaw 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had discussions with them, and we have had discussions with a lot of 
companies about how to increase our footprint," said McCaw Vice President Bob 
Ratliffe. 
</P>
<P>
 While industry analysts did not expect any kind of deal between the two 
companies immediately, they said the talks appear to be heading toward a new 
marketing arrangement that would take effect after AT&T Corp. completes its 
planned $12.6-billion acquisition of McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not talking about a business combination," said William Deatherage of 
S.G. Warburg Securities. "But there is a potential for a strategic marketing 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 McCaw and Southwestern Bell currently are partners with Vanguard Cellular 
Communications Inc. in Cellular One Group, a national brand name for cellular 
telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems markets cellular telephone 
services under its own name in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas 
but uses the Cellular One name in more distant markets such as Chicago, Boston 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the merger of AT&T and McCaw goes through as analysts expect, the 
Cellular One name will probably be changed as AT&T seeks to benefit from its 
own name-brand recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cellular One would survive somewhere in the picture, but AT&T would have to 
be prominent and dominant," said Steve Yanis of Kidder Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
 That would potentially put Southwestern Bell, formed in the 1984 breakup of 
AT&T Corp., in the unusual position of promoting a service carrying the name of 
its former parent. 
</P>
<P>
 But industry analysts believe Southwestern Bell has little choice but to 
maintain its cellular alliance as the industry consolidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between Southwestern Bell and other regional Bell companies have been 
fruitless so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Nynex Corp. has announced plans to merge its cellular operations 
with those of Bell Atlantic Corp., and US West Inc. plans to combine cellular 
operations with AirTouch Communications Inc.

GARAMENDI CALLS FARMERS PLAN TO RAISE QUAKE DEDUCTIBLES ILLEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi on Thursday accused Farmers 
Insurance Group Inc. of illegally planning to raise deductibles on earthquake 
insurance by 25% without prior approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi ordered Farmers to explain itself before him on Sept. 6.Afterward, 
he said, he will decide whether to issue a cease-and-desist order. "In 
declaring its intention to only renew earthquake insurance policies with 25% 
deductibles, the Farmers Cos. have basically declared their intention to offer 
worthless earthquake insurance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said the plan violates three state laws. The first guarantees a 
policyholder's right to renew coverage at the same deductible. The second 
guarantees the availability of earthquake coverage. The third requires prior 
approval of rate changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, a wholly owned subsidiary of London-based B.A.T Industries, announced 
July 15 that it would raise deductibles on California quake coverage by between 
10% and 25%, depending on the type of policy, while reducing premiums 25% to 
40%. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had previously suspended the sale of new residential quake 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the moves were intended to protect Farmers' financial strength and its 
ability to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 The company estimated that since 1973, it had collected $449 million in 
earthquake premiums but paid losses of $1.24 billion. It also said it had 
identified nine fault lines within California that had loss potentials ranging 
from $1 billion to $3 billion.

ECONOMY; GOVERNMENT TO LAUNCH NEW INFLATION INDICATOR IN '96 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Labor Department plans to launch a new tool for measuring retail inflation 
in 1996 that may give a lower reading than the well-established consumer price 
index, a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department will release its July CPI today, and Wall Street economists 
expect it to show a 0.3% gain, the same as last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The new index will not seek to replace the CPI, said Paul Armknecht, assistant 
commissioner for consumer prices at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But it will 
go some way toward addressing criticism that the CPI overstates inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're exploring putting out an alternative index using a different 
estimator," he said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony to a House operations subcommittee this week, Federal Reserve 
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan urged the bureau in coming years to confront the 
problem of "systematic biases" that may exist in the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Armknecht, that is exactly what the department is doing. It 
experimented with the parallel index last year and in December published its 
findings that showed retail inflation about three-tenths of a percent short of 
the CPI reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are concerned about monetary policy may think it's a better 
indicator," he said, adding that if the plan gets beyond the drawing board 
stage, it will be released in 1996. But he played down the impact it would have 
on data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even using the different estimator, the difference (between the two inflation 
readings) isn't going to be anywhere near the order of 1% or 2%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several factors that may skew the consumer price index, all of which 
complicate the jobs of Fed policy-makers and Wall Street analysts who need to 
understand where inflation is headed to decide where interest rates should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking after Greenspan on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, David Wyss, research 
director at DRI/McGraw Hill, suggested that U.S. inflation may actually be half 
the 3% rate it is currently considered to be if changes in productivity growth 
are factored in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would the Federal Reserve be as eager to tighten if the consumer price index 
were rising only 1.5%?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Armknecht listed several other factors that affect the CPI. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the index is measured from an anachronistic basket of goods that 
dates back to 1982-84. It has also been slow to incorporate prices of goods 
sold at discount outlets, even though such prices are usually lower than 
department stores'. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the index excludes new products until they become mainstream. By 
that time, a product -- pocket calculators, for example -- will have run the 
course of price declines a new item typically enjoys. It will join the index 
when its price has fallen about as far as it can go. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely, however, that any revised reading on inflation would force the 
Fed to change its mind on the economy. Greenspan said he factors biases in 
inflation indicators into his calculations and looks at a host of other factors 
to chart monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Armknecht noted that even if a parallel reading was at a lower overall level 
than the CPI, the two indexes would rise in lock step once inflationary 
pressures began showing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Until June, the data was showing no inflationary problem, but danger still 
lurks. "The CPI is not a leading indicator," Armknecht said. "It's usually a 
lagging indicator."

 CAA's Ovitz in Talks With Baby Bells: Hollywood super-agent Michael Ovitz is 
in talks with Pacific Telesis, Bell Atlantic and Nynex to create a joint 
venture to bring movies and other programming to homes, according to 
sources.With its extensive Hollywood contacts, Ovitz's Creative Artists Agency 
would help the big regional phone companies obtain rights to entertainment 
programming. CAA is also expected to act as the group's investment banker, 
finding companies the Baby Bells can invest in, a source said. Industry 
observers say they saw it as inevitable that the Baby Bells would find their 
way to Ovitz's door, given his clout, as they rush to compete with cable 
companies in delivering entertainment.

 'Greenest' Motor Vehicles Rated: If you're looking for a car that's friendly 
to the planet, try one of the three versions of the Geo Metro, topped by Metro 
FXi; the 1.5-liter Honda Civic CX, and the 2.3-liter Oldsmobile Achieva, a 
consumer group survey recommends. Light trucks fared worst in the "The Green 
Buyer's Car Book," a Public Citizen report on 1994 cars and trucks. Each model 
was judged on a combination of four factors: smog and carbon monoxide 
emissions, global warming caused by its fuel consumption, use of 
ozone-depleting chemicals and recyclability.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: EUROPE BUMPS UP RATES, THROWING INVESTORS A CURVE 
</P>

<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board's inflation paranoia appears to be catching on, and 
it's making for another round of misery in stock and bond markets worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a shocker Thursday, the central banks of Sweden and Italy separately raised 
short-term interest rates -- the first increases in European short rates since 
autumn of 1992. Predictably, stock prices tumbled in Europe and long-term bond 
yields soared on the news. 
</P>
<P>
 In language all too familiar to Americans this year, both the Swedes and the 
Italians cited the need for higher rates to head off inflation as the world 
economy picks up steam. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal politics also may be guiding the authorities at Sweden's Riksbank and 
at the Bank of Italy: The budget deficits of both countries have been 
ballooning, and the central banks are trying to make clear to their governments 
that the price of continued heavy deficit financing will be higher interest 
rates, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is enough strength in the European economy this summer to make 
the inflation concerns of the Riksbank and the Bank of Italy believable. 
Believable, if not justifiable in the eyes of many global investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, just as critics of the U.S. Fed have contended that Chairman Alan 
Greenspan sees inflation where it doesn't exist, many investors in European 
stocks argued Thursday that the Swedes and Italians are jumping the gun, 
endangering an economic recovery that began only this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher rates "just don't make any sense from an economic point of view," said 
Malcolm Clinger, chief investment officer for Swiss Bank Corp.'s private 
banking unit in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 David Peebles, manager of the USAA Investment International stock fund in San 
Antonio, also expressed surprise at the rate hikes and noted what the 
disheartening outcome is likely to be: an end to what had been widespread 
expectations that European interest rates could still move lower this year, 
especially in the key economies of Germany and France. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, rates in Europe are already too high, given the Continent's 
generally low inflation rates and high unemployment rates, the latter a seeming 
guarantee that huge labor surpluses exist and will keep wage inflation 
nonexistent in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Swedes and Italians made their moves Thursday, investors like 
Peebles had been betting on European stocks in part because the interest rate 
outlook appeared favorable at best and neutral at worst, especially compared to 
the rising-rate environment of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some global investors admit they must rethink Europe if higher interest 
rates are coming this soon in an economic recovery. British stocks may be most 
vulnerable, because Britain is further along than the Continent in recovery and 
thus more prone to inflationary pressures and rising rates. "We will be cutting 
back our U.K. stock holdings" today, Clinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 But is a turn in European short-term interest rates enough to bring on a 
full-blown bear market in stocks there? On that question, the U.S. experience 
may be a good model. While the U.S. market has been in turmoil this year, most 
broad stock indexes are off only marginally measured since Jan. 1. And while it 
hasn't been easy to make money in U.S. stocks as interest rates have risen, 
savvy stock pickers have done it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most European markets are already down more this year than the U.S. market, 
correcting some of last year's surge. From here, some pros say the right 
approach to European stocks is to view that economy in the same light as the 
U.S. economy: It's growing, and it will continue to grow even as the central 
banks work their sorcery with interest rates. A recession soon is not in the 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 That means European corporate earnings will rise into 1995, assuring there 
should always be something for stock investors to get excited about -- if only 
during interest rate lulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Cragg, manager of the Strong International Stock fund in Milwaukee, 
says an interest rate turn in Europe means "we're past the point of buying 
lousy companies for a turnaround" -- a relatively easy game, he notes. Now the 
turnaround is here, and stock picking gets much tougher, Cragg says. For global 
mutual fund managers, this is when the true pros are separated from the 
amateurs and pretenders. The Rate Conundrum 
</P>
<P>
 European short-term interest rates--already well above U.S. rates--are rising 
again, though inflation remains low in Europe and the unemployment rate is 
sky-high. 04,15,12,11,11 Short-term interest Inflation Unemploy. Country rates 
rate rate Italy 8.5% 3.6% 11.6% Sweden 7.4 2.5 8.5 Britain 5.6 2.6 9.4 Canada

 Worrisome economic news and surprise interest rate hikes by Sweden and Italy 
sent bond yields surging worldwide Thursday, knocking stocks lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst damage occurred in Europe, where German bonds, for example, suffered 
their biggest one-day price drop of the year. Broad stock indexes across Europe 
dropped 1% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. market, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 15.86 points to 
3,750.90, fighting back from heavier losses early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 European markets were riled by news that Sweden's central bank raised its key 
lending rate for banks to 8% from 7.5%, the first increase in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, the Italian central bank also boosted short-term rates, 
hiking its "discount" rate to 7.5% from 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities at the two central banks said they were responding to concerns 
that inflation may begin to rise if the economic recovery in Europe continues 
to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban Baeckstrom, governor of the Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, said it 
was moving at "an early stage to counter a tendency to increased inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, analysts said the central bank's rate boost was in part to defend 
the weak lira -- raising the potential for a repeat of the market explosion in 
Europe in the fall of 1992, when central banks competed to defend their 
currencies with higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 That episode ended with the effective destruction of the so-called European 
Exchange Rate Mechanism that was designed to link currencies' values. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Swedish and Italian rate hikes caught investors by surprise 
and sparked a selloff in European bond markets. In Germany, the yield on the 
benchmark 10-year government bond soared to 7.22% from 7% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain, the yield on 15-year government bonds zoomed to 8.63% from 8.48%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields had been easing across Europe in recent weeks, but Thursday's 
action suggested that the decline has run its course, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. bond market, yields were buffeted by Europe's turmoil and by news 
of higher-than-expected wholesale inflation in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said the producer price index shot up 0.5% in July, the 
biggest increase in 15 months. Even though the "core" inflation rate, which 
excludes energy and food prices, was up only 0.1%, investors weren't mollified. 
</P>
<P>
 Also weighing on the market were upward revisions by the Commerce Department 
in its May and June retail sales figures, indicating healthy demand and making 
July's slight 0.1% decline in retail sales seem insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
 With those reports for a backdrop, the Treasury concluded its quarterly 
refinancing Thursday, selling $11 billion in new 30-year bonds and paying an 
average yield of 7.56% on them, above traders' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on existing 30-year T-bonds, meanwhile, jumped to 7.65% from 7.57% 
on Wednesday. Yields on most shorter-term Treasury securities also rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market faces another potential jolt today, when the government 
reports on July consumer price inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 One casualty of the rise in European rates Thursday was the dollar, which sank 
as short-term "cash" investments in Europe became even more attractive compared 
to U.S. securities. The dollar tumbled to 1.561 German marks, down from 1.584 
on Wednesday, and to 100.23 Japanese yen from 101.35. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, analysts said they were somewhat surprised that U.S. stocks 
didn't fare worse. Losers topped winners by 13 to 7 on the Big Board, but broad 
stock indexes lost little ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said investors may have already accepted that the Federal 
Reserve Board is likely to raise short-term rates again when it meets next 
week. The hikes in Swedish and Italian rates could help force the Fed's hand if 
the dollar continues to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Losses were heavy in most European stock markets. London's FTSE-100 index 
tumbled 28.8 points to 3,138.2, while in Paris the CAC index sank 25.24 points 
to 2,038.93. 
</P>
<P>
 In Stockholm, the SX-16 index plunged 2.2%, while Milan's Mibtel index fell 
1.1%. Frankfurt's DAX index, however, eased just 5.09 points to 2,155.28. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average gained 51.11 points to 20,821.36, and 
Mexico City's Bolsa index rose 22.22 points to 2,596.89. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. industrial stocks were mostly lower. Alcoa lost 5/8 to 78 1/8, Exxon 
fell 7/8 to 58 1/8, International Paper dropped 7/8 to 74 1/8 and Caterpillar 
was off 1 1/2 to 103. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many technology stocks, however, continued to rally. Intel rose 5/8 to 60 
3/8, Microsoft gained 1 1/8 to 55 1/4 and Computer Sciences surged 7/8 to 41 
7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southland cosmetics firm Neutrogena soared 4 7/8 to 26 1/2 after saying 
Wednesday that it is in talks to be acquired.

the next big prime-time hit, a ritual euphemistically called "the development 
process." The system -- if it can be considered that -- is as obscure and 
secret as the burial customs of ancient Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in an effort to find a less costly way to develop programs, NBC has 
abolished the decades-old structure of making separate executives responsible 
for comedy and drama and instead has assigned them to "teams" covering 
Hollywood's studios. This way, argues NBC, the executives can remain with a 
project "from pitch to production." 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to changing the way business is done, Hollywood is 
notoriously conservative: The old way is the best way. Indeed, many producers, 
agents and writers think NBC is attacking the most sacrosanct of Hollywood 
institutions: The Relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone thinks it's a total joke," gripes one successful agent who does not 
want to speak on the record because he earns handsome commissions from NBC 
shows. "It's hard enough for someone to get to know all the comedy writers in 
town, let alone drama." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the relationship between a producer and the network executive -- 
cultivated over years of sharing large bottles of Pellegrino and demitasse 
servings of espresso -- that can nurture, shepherd and groom a TV show through 
the labyrinth of the development process. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the old system is something of an old boy's network rife 
with favoritism: innovative program ideas get tabled in favor of pet projects 
between a producer and network executive. Not surprisingly, doing away with 
those baser elements is exactly what NBC has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of 'round up the usual suspects' " in program development, says 
Don Ohlmeyer, president of NBC West Coast. "When you have a tight funnel there 
are only so many relationships you can have. . . . All we're trying to do is 
widen the funnel." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, network programming executives have either worked in the 
"current" department, overseeing series already on the air, or in 
"development," working to bring out new shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The departments are further subdivided between comedy and drama, with, for 
example, the comedy development executive handing the show off to his or her 
counterpart in the "current" department when the show becomes a series. This 
system is still in effect at ABC, CBS and Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Under NBC's new setup, the programming executive will be on one of four teams 
and responsible for sticking with a project from conception through the various 
stages of development, script, pilot and series. Of course, the chances of 
going to the next stage diminish every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohlmeyer says the idea of abolishing the traditional structure for program 
development originally came from an MBA intern who was working at the network's 
Burbank programming office. NBC Entertainment President Warren "Littlefield and 
I had been thinking about changing the way we do business for some time," he 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 To people on the outside -- or virtually everyone in the world, save for a 
couple of hundred people -- the slow, cumbersome and costly development system 
ultimately produces just more shopworn sitcoms and police dramas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development process as we know it is hardly perfect, and the failure rate 
is way too high," says Leslie Moonves, president of Warner Bros. TV, which 
produces such series as "Murphy Brown," and "Sisters." He concedes, "We are a 
terribly traditional community." 
</P>
<P>
 It's said that a dozen writer-producers in television produce 80% of the 
networks' prime-time schedule. While the figure may fluctuate from season to 
season, the networks do rely on the same handful of "creative" talent to 
develop new shows -- like the production teams of Miller-Boyet, 
Witt-Thomas-Harris and Charles-Burrows-Charles, not to mention heavyweight 
producers like James Brooks or Steve Bochco, who have their own series 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, says Ohlmeyer, is that not enough ideas are coming into the 
network's development hopper from a variety of sources. By opening up the hunt 
for new shows beyond the small squad of elite development executives, "we'll 
get more diversity," he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most network programming executives have never actually produced a TV show. 
That is not the case at the BBC in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "A BBC executive understands program budgets, knows how to physically produce 
a show," says Alan Berger, head of the TV department at International Creative 
Management. "There are not many American programming executives who have done 
that. . . . It's like having an editor who was not a reporter first." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, at least we can assure our readers that never happens. . . .

 * Films: Sony Pictures consolidated the motion picture marketing operations of 
Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures on Thursday under Columbia Pictures Vice 
Chairman Sid Ganis, the new president of worldwide marketing. In addition, 
Jeffrey Blake, president of domestic distribution for Columbia Pictures, was 
given the additional responsibility of overseeing the distribution operations 
of Triumph Releasing, which handles low-budget films.As part of the 
reorganization, Blake will also oversee distribution at Columbia and TriStar, 
although management said the two companies will continue to operate as 
stand-alone labels. Ganis will report to Columbia TriStar Chairman Mark Canton 
and President Fred Bernstein. Duncan Clark has been named executive vice 
president of worldwide marketing and will report to Ganis and J. Edward 
Shugrue, president of Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International. As a 
result of the shuffle, TriStar marketing presidents Buffy Shutt and Kathy 
Jones, who are being courted by rival studios, are leaving. And Canton, who 
joined Columbia three years ago, has signed a new three-year deal with Sony.

COMPANY TOWN; BILL WOULD REQUIRE TICKET FEE DISCLOSURES; LEGISLATION: REP. 
DINGELL TAKES AIM AT CONCERNS OVER PRICES CUSTOMERS PAY TO GET INTO CONCERTS 
AND SPORTING EVENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Concert and sports fans have a new ally in the battle over the way tickets are 
sold in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Powerful U.S. Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) says he will take time out from 
the national health care debate -- possibly as early as next week -- to 
introduce a bill requiring ticket distributors to disclose the fees they add to 
the price of each ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both performers and the public have expressed concern that consumers are not 
properly informed of the charges for ticket services," said Dingell, chairman 
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "This would be a modest and simple 
proposal to address their concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, it would mark the first nationwide regulation of ticket 
distribution. It would put transactions conducted by firms such as Los 
Angeles-based Ticketmaster under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster Chairman Fredric D. Rosen could not be reached for comment, but a 
senior executive for the firm said Thursday that Ticketmaster supports 
Dingell's full-disclosure bill. Though critics dispute Ticketmaster's claims, 
the company maintains that it already informs consumers exactly how much the 
firm charges in service fees before each transaction and prints that amount on 
the face of the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the proposal comes as the Justice Department is stepping up a probe of 
anti-competitive practices in the ticket-distribution industry, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was triggered by a civil antitrust complaint filed May 6 by 
Seattle rock band Pearl Jam, which accused Ticketmaster of exercising a 
national monopoly over ticket distribution and of using its influence with 
promoters to thwart the group's planned low-priced tour this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue are the fees charged by independent ticket agencies -- an industry 
dominated by Ticketmaster -- to sell tickets by phone and at record stores and 
other sites on behalf of promoters. Ticketmaster service fees for many rock 
concerts add from $4 to $8 to the price paid by customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials -- who in May ordered Ticketmaster to surrender 
records pertinent to the probe -- have added investigators to the case and are 
conducting extensive interviews in several states with major promoters, talent 
agents and ticket software firms, sources said. Dingell became interested in 
the ticket issue after members of Pearl Jam testified at a June 30 hearing on 
Capitol Hill called by the House Government Operations subcommittee to explore 
the $1-billion concert industry in the United States. The hearing was chaired 
by U.S. Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), co-sponsor of Dingell's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dingell proposal is designed to prevent such actions as this summer's 
attempt to bury escalating service fees in the price of tickets for a 
nationwide Eagles concert tour. 
</P>
<P>
 At one Southern California show, tickets sold for as much as $115. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very glad to hear that Congress sees this as a national issue," said 
Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis.

COMPANY TOWN; SCREEN BOMBS, GOODWILL GAMES SLAM TBS PROFIT 
</P>

 Turner Broadcasting System, weighed down by money-losing movies and the costly 
1994 Goodwill Games, said Thursday that second-quarter profit plunged about 60% 
from last year's levels to $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite higher advertising revenue from cable and broadcast operations, the 
Atlanta-based company was hobbled by the poor box office showings of "City 
Slickers II" and "Little Big League." 
</P>
<P>
 The three months ended June 30 were also marred by a $26-million loss related 
to the sponsorship and broadcast of the 1994 Goodwill Games, which were plagued 
with low viewership. Turner's total loss on the games in St. Petersburg, 
Russia, were $39 million when previous expenses are included. 
</P>
<P>
 "With continuing network expansion domestically and internationally, as well 
as the combined effects of telecasting the Winter Olympics and the Goodwill 
Games in the same year, we knew 1994 would be financially challenging," TBS 
President and Chairman Ted Turner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-quarter results would have been worse except for a one-time, pretax 
gain of $22 million related to the sale of Turner's 37% stake in RHI 
Entertainment for about $108 million cash. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Turner Class A shares slipped 25 cents to $18.25 on the American 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said the third quarter looks promising, since movies such as "Mask" are 
performing well.

BERKELEY ECONOMIST YELLEN IS CONFIRMED FOR FED SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janet Yellen, a UC Berkeley economist, won Senate confirmation Thursday for a 
seat on the Federal Reserve Board, becoming President Clinton's second 
appointee to the powerful central bank policy panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate cleared Yellen's nomination on a 94-6 vote just in time for her to 
join the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting Tuesday, where the central bank 
may raise interest rates to combat inflation.She will sit on both the Fed's 
board and the policy-making Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Clinton named and the Senate confirmed Alan Blinder, a 
member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, to be the Fed's vice 
chairman. Blinder succeeded Fed Vice Chairman David Mullins, who took a 
position in the securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on July 22, Yellen said she 
supports the Fed's efforts this year to contain price increases by raising 
rates. The Fed has acted four times since February to push up the federal funds 
rate on overnight loans among banks, bringing it to 4.25% from 3%. It also 
raised rates for direct loans to banks to 3.5% from 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) was the only dissenter in the banking 
committee's 18-1 vote for Yellen. Faircloth was concerned that Yellen "was too 
soft on inflation, and she didn't have any private-sector experience," a 
Faircloth aide said.

TEAM EFFORT KEEPS ANOTHER BUSINESS IN O.C.; ECONOMY: JOHNSON BATTERY PLANT AND 
ITS 280 JOBS WILL REMAIN IN FULLERTON. CONSORTIUM HELPED IT CUT ENERGY COSTS, 
MEET REGULATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major victory for forces seeking to keep businesses in Orange County, 
Johnson Controls Inc. has decided not to move an automotive battery plant -- 
and 280 jobs -- from Fullerton, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of executives from the Orange County Economic Development Consortium 
have been meeting with Johnson managers and union representatives during the 
summer to find ways that the company can cut its energy costs and meet 
environmental regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint effort came up with ways to achieve a 25% energy savings by moving 
peak production to times of the day when electric rates are lower, said Rep. Ed 
Royce (R-Fullerton), who was involved in negotiations. Johnson officials could 
not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The team contacted Johnson after being alerted in June that the company was 
contemplating a move. Johnson, based in Milwaukee, said at the time that it was 
consolidating its battery plants nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of jobs have slipped out of Orange County in the past five years as 
employers have sought more lenient environmental restrictions, lower workers' 
compensation insurance costs and cheaper energy. Orange County Chamber of 
Commerce officials have joined other business groups to try to halt the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the coalition's biggest victories came in June, when Taco Bell Corp. 
decided to keep its headquarters in Irvine for at least another five years. Its 
decision came after heavy lobbying, including personal appeals by Gov. Pete 
Wilson, imploring the company not to move. 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier this week, the city of Anaheim persuaded one of the nation's 
largest makers of compact discs to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 Disc Manufacturing Co., which had considered moving out of state, has decided 
instead to double its 170-person Anaheim work force over four years and spend 
$30 million to expand its operations there. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber Chairman H. Fred Mickelson said Johnson Control's decision is 
particularly sweet because manufacturing jobs pay well and also spur the 
economy by supporting suppliers of raw materials and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we knock down barriers and provide solutions, it gets the word out 
and the confidence up that we can retain our business here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Johnson's case, he said, cutting energy costs was a critical factor in 
enticing the company to stay. Electricity accounts for 10% to 15% of production 
costs at the Fullerton plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives were included in the negotiations, Mickelson said, and 
that was an important factor because part of the solution depends on workers 
being willing to take shifts that involve other than daytime hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major victory because it's proof that, if we get in with a customer 
and find out what the needs are . . . we can retain and grow businesses here in 
Orange County," Mickelson said.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: LONG BEACH INVESTOR BUYS AIRPORTER GARDEN HOTEL IN 
IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike C. Wang, a 30-year-old Long Beach real estate investor, has purchased the 
214-room Airporter Garden Hotel in Irvine for $10 million, his first real 
estate purchase in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, president of the hotel division of Wang Partnership in Long Beach, said 
the hotel, at 18700 MacArthur Blvd. directly across from John Wayne Airport, is 
undergoing a $4-million renovation to be completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel was purchased from the Duffy family, which had owned and operated it 
for more than 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted a location by an airport in an upscale city, and Irvine fit the 
bill," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Airporter is the fifth hotel Wang has purchased through his partnership. 
He owns hotels in Southern California and in Colorado.

 Comarco Inc.: The Yorba Linda-based company said Thursday that it has acquired 
privately held software developer LCTI in Gaithersburg, Md. The company, with 
revenue of about $1.5 million a year, sells proprietary software used in the 
automated test system market. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Comarco has been an LCTI customer in the past, buying its software to use in 
development of test programs for the U.S. Navy. Comarco provides wireless 
communications products, engineering services and facility management services 
to government and commercial clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Test systems are the computers that run tests on complex electronic equipment 
-- from television sets to the navigation equipment on an aircraft carrier. 
LCTI was founded in 1990 to design a product to streamline the process of 
programming and documenting the software for electronic test systems. 
</P>
<P>
 It first sold its product to the U.S. Army in 1991, and all branches of the 
military have since purchased it. Commercial applications focus on the airline 
community, telecommunications and the medical and biotechnology industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will be operated as a separate unit of Comarco, said Don M. 
Bailey, Comarco president.

SANTA ANA HIRES ROCKWELL TO DESIGN TRAFFIC DATA SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rockwell International Corp. has been awarded a $70,000 contract by the city 
of Santa Ana to design a traffic information system, the company's third major 
traffic management project in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The design by Rockwell's Anaheim-based Autonetics Electronic Systems division, 
which should be finished by the end of the year, would result in a proposal to 
be put up for bid. Although no final design decisions have been made, the 
system will probably allow drivers to telephone a data center to learn about 
traffic conditions throughout Santa Ana, said company and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers will also probably place information kiosks at sites such as the new 
Ronald Reagan federal courthouse and at Santa Ana City Hall, company officials 
said. They are also considering ways to allow home computer users to access the 
system, said a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 T.C. Sutaria, Santa Ana's traffic engineer, said that the city expects the 
system to cost $400,000 to $500,000, and that it could be in operation by the 
end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes about a month before the Orange County Transportation 
Authority is expected to award a similar contract for the design of a 
countywide public information system. That contract's value is estimated at 
about $500,000; the total project will probably cost $3 million to $4 million, 
said Dean Delgado, a senior transportation analyst with OCTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has secured funds from the Federal Highway Administration to pay 
for the design phase of its system; it does not yet have funds for the 
construction phase, Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA board member Sarah Catz said that in addition to Rockwell, she expects 
bids from rivals Lockheed Corp. and Hughes Traffic Management Systems, a 
division of the electronics company based in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 All three companies see computerized traffic management systems as a good way 
to shift their aerospace expertise to the civilian sector, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA is also working with Caltrans to fund a test of devices on 10 to 15 buses 
that would allow orbiting satellites to pinpoint their position. That 
technology would eventually allow people waiting for buses to learn the current 
location of the bus and area traffic conditions, Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has $1.8 million in state and federal grant money for the joint 
project with the state transportation agency, Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell's Anaheim division also has a $75,000 contract with UC Irvine's 
Institute for Transportation Studies to install wireless communications 
equipment along a five-mile stretch of the Riverside Freeway in order to 
provide researchers with more accurate data on traffic behavior.

HOME SALES, RESALES PROJECTED TO RISE 17.2% LOCALLY THIS YEAR 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County's housing market will be among the most improved in the state 
this year, with the number of sales and resales rising 17.2%, according to 
projections released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Across California, total transactions are predicted to increase 7.5% to 
378,000 this year -- the first annual increase since 1989, according to TRW 
Redi Property Data in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really great news, . . . but it's an improvement," said Nima 
Nattagh, a TRW analyst. "And if you look at the state, Orange County is doing 
really well." 
</P>
<P>
 The housing market expected to show the biggest improvement is the 
Salinas-Monterey metropolitan area, where sales and resales are expected to 
jump more than 32% to 4,474 units. Projected to lead in total number of 
transactions is the Los Angeles-Long Beach area, with a 13.2% increase to 
81,763 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is ranked fifth, with 35,952 transactions projected.  
</P>
<P>
 "People look at Orange County and Los Angeles as part of the same economic 
structure, but we can see that home sales are doing very well in Orange County, 
while Los Angeles County is still lagging," Nattagh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nattagh said he does not expect the year's totals to vary much from the 
projections, even if interest rates go up, which generally dampens home sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures released Thursday are based on the premise that the pace of home 
sales for the year so far will continue through December. The study ranks homes 
sales in the state's 23 metropolitan areas, of which Orange County is one, 
Nattagh said. Home Sales Turn Upward 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of new and existing homes in California are projected to increase 7.5% 
for 1994, the first improvement since 1989. Sales of new homes are expected to 
increase by 3.5%.

 Fluor Corp.: The Irvine-based firm said Thursday that two of its operating 
units have received major construction contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Daniel has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and 
construction management services for a $400-million expansion of the Escondida 
copper mine in Chile.It is the third expansion at the mine that Fluor Daniel 
has handled. The company also provided engineering and construction management 
services for the original mine facilities in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Fluor Constructors International said that it has won a 
construction management contract for a $30-million water treatment plant 
expansion in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit of Fluor Corp. has been working at the Chalk Bluff treatment plant 
since 1992 and held the original construction contract as well. The plant is 
operated by Sierra Pacific Power Co. of Reno and supplies drinking water to the 
cities of Reno and Sparks, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 As construction managers, the Fluor units receive a percentage of the contract 
value. The company does not release information about its fees on specific 
jobs.

 Gish Biomedical Inc., an Irvine manufacturer of medical products, posted a 
profit of $1.3 million, or 41 cents a share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 
down 28% from the $1.8 million, or 54 cents a share, recorded for the previous 
year.The company attributed the decline to higher research and development 
costs and to increased direct sales activity. Revenue remained at $21.1 
million. Fourth-quarter profit was down 4% from the like period a year ago, to 
$435,000, or 14 cents a share, from $452,000, or 14 cents a share. Sales dipped 
to $5.5 million from $5.7 million for fiscal 1993.

PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC CO. SETTLES BREACH-OF-CONTRACT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just three weeks after vowing to "vigorously defend itself against this 
action," Pacific Scientific Co. said Thursday that it has settled a 
breach-of-contract lawsuit arising from its sale of a line of mechanical seals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach-based maker of electronic measuring equipment declined to 
disclose the exact amount of the settlement with Texas-based Accuflex Inc. but 
said it would reduce third-quarter earnings by about 10 cents a share.That 
would equal about $542,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Accuflex had sought actual damages of $7 million and punitive damages of $70 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Scientific officials said the settlement involved no admission of 
liability by the company and they continue to maintain that the suit was 
without merit. 
</P>
<P>
 The company sold the mechanical seal line, produced by a Pacific Scientific 
division, to Accuflex in 1990 for $200,000 and later sold other assets of that 
same division to John Crane Inc., an Accuflex competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 In its breach-of-contract suit, Accuflex named both Pacific Scientific and 
John Crane Inc., alleging that the sale to John Crane violated a 
non-competition agreement executed when Pacific Scientific sold Accuflex the 
product line.

ACME HOLDINGS HIRES FIRM IN STRENGTHENING MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acme Holdings Inc., an equipment rental company, has hired an investment 
banking firm to possibly refund or restructure $78 million in junk bonds the 
privately held company sold last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, the New York investment firm, will determine ways 
to strengthen Irvine-based Acme, which has posted nearly $16 million in losses 
in the past 16 months and has seen its longtime chairman abruptly resign in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials could meet with major bondholders, which include several 
large private investment funds, as early as next week, said Rivian Bell, a 
company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have retained DLJ to help us explore recapitalization alternatives and 
identify long-term solutions that will strengthen our balance sheet and 
position Acme for a strong, profitable future," Martin Reid, Acme's chairman 
and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid replaced Ira Mendelsohn as chairman and chief executive officer June 15, 
when Mendelsohn resigned from the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Acme, which operates 21 rental locations in four states, reported a loss of 
$14.1 million in 1993, compared to a $1.1-million loss the previous year. The 
company also reported a loss of $1.8 million for the quarter ending March 31, 
up from a loss of $992,000 during the same time last year. Revenue increased to 
$16.8 million from $15.3 million.

THE SCENE: SKATEBOARDERS LOOK FOR A SPORTING CHANCE; SERIOUS ORANGE COUNTY 
COMPETITORS ENJOY THE CHALLENGES, BUT NOT THE RESTRICTIVE CITY ORDINANCES, LACK 
OF RINKS AND NEGATIVE PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Huntington Beach High School had finished the skateboard rink it had 
scheduled for use by the beginning of the school year, Ocean View High senior 
Jeff Harmon would have entreated his mom to let him switch schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He was willing to ditch three years of classmates, teachers and his alma mater 
for a patch of concrete. Even exchanging the short ride to Ocean View High on 
his skateboard for a car transport a few miles away seemed worth the hassle. To 
Jeff, Huntington Beach High's decision to build a rink was evidence that it 
finally understood his passion. Maybe they'd someday even provide skateboarding 
the kind of support other high school sports get. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played every sport known to man," says Jeff, 17, who's been 
skateboarding for about five years and finds it the most exciting of activities 
he's tried. The inherent spontaneity of executing skills, where no object -- 
not fire hydrant, stair rail or brick wall -- poses a barrier but serves as 
another challenge in the circuit of the urban landscape, that's what thrills. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a certain amount of aggressiveness to maneuver a trick (even as 
simple as popping the board up in the air and keeping it attached to your feet 
as if by magic) when the terrain is rock hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff's demeanor is anything but aggressive during conversation. "This is what 
I enjoy best," he says. "People see this as something a bunch of little punks 
do. But this is a tough sport. This is more than just my hobby." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the close to 8 million skateboarders nationwide, 42% are 12 to 17, 
according to Transworld Skateboarding Magazine in Oceanside. Just scanning the 
pages of this publication and others on the market, including Thrasher (San 
Francisco), Monster magazine (Germany), Slam (Australia) and Rad (England), 
reflects an audience consisting mostly of young males united by their zeal for 
skateboarding. This is not a scene defined, as many are, by attitudes, 
intellectual opinions or music. There is no icon, no school of thought or era 
to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Camaraderie arises from a shared sense that their interest in skateboarding is 
still regarded as the stuff of outcasts. It is banned in many public areas and 
only begrudgingly acknowledged as a competitive sport -- even though it's the 
sixth largest participant sport in the United States. Internationally, it 
claims millions of devotees from here to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are musical acts that skate and others that claim a following 
primarily of skateboarders, there is no one music that skateboarders en masse 
identify with. Punk rock, rap, hip-hop and alternative music artists are all 
profiled in the skate mags.  
</P>
<P>
 Clothes identify them somewhat. Skateboarders drove extra large sizes to 
fashionable status -- not in the name of fashion but practicality. Ollying 
(jumping) over a post, riding up the wall of a swimming pool or simply gliding 
over a flat surface is enough of a stretch without being constrained in 
tight-fitting jeans that stick to sweaty skin. Lycra bicycle shorts are just 
not an option among teen-age skateboarders. 
</P>
<P>
 Loose-fitting clothes, including odd, thrift-shop finds, will likely not be 
replaced any time soon, but an emerging sartorial trend disturbs dedicated 
riders such as Jeff.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very judgmental now. It's all about a Big Scene. It basically sucks, 
because all these little kids care about is brand names," Jeff says, pointing 
to teens a couple of years his junior. "It's a big fashion show now. They just 
sit here and watch, but they don't really skate." 
</P>
<P>
 These wanna-bes talk plenty about being sponsored by a skateboard company, a 
coup for any young rider because of the attention and free merchandise that 
comes with it. The proliferation of companies inundating the market in recent 
years has resulted in a frenzy among owners (who tend to be skaters in their 
mid-20s to early 30s) and their customers to pledge allegiance to a label. With 
so many companies based in Southern California, the concentration of sponsored 
riders is high. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff landed a sponsorship with Grind Inc. in Huntington Beach six months ago.  
</P>
<P>
 But, he says, "there are all these companies sponsoring every little kid. Too 
many of them aren't even good enough and don't deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While skateboarders have to face occasional discrimination from within, more 
frequently they have to contend with external forces that have lumped them all 
as juvenile delinquents who vandalize, get stoned and tag. 
</P>
<P>
 There are vandals, stoners and taggers who skateboard, notes Jeff, just as 
there are those who play baseball or football. 
</P>
<P>
 The major issue lies with the complaints by city officials and business owners 
angered over street curbs, bus benches and parking stops chipped and ground 
down by the metal trucks that hold the wheels. Signs banning skateboards are 
posted at mini-malls, schools, parks, beach boardwalks and other places. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if that's not enough, riding a skateboard on streets and in public areas 
in many cities is a violation punishable by some pretty hefty fines. While 
arrests have been made for skateboarding on sidewalks and school grounds in 
recent years, some cities have reduced the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, two 15-year-olds were handcuffed and photographed by 
sheriff's deputies for cruising alongside a Laguna Niguel road. Uproar over the 
arrests prompted a change in how violations are handled. Instead of being 
booked, skaters are issued citations, which can carry a $25 fine for a first 
offense and $50 for a subsequent violation. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, skateboarding on the pier can land you a $162 ticket. Other 
cities have similar laws on the books.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff recently got a ticket for riding across the campus of a local elementary 
school. Although he says he apologized to the officer and tried to be 
cooperative, he ended up with a citation. Jeff says he was told he was getting 
a ticket to make an example of him to his friends and because he was not 
carrying identification.  
</P>
<P>
 It's all enough to push a teen into defense mode. "Skateboarding is not a 
crime" has become the rallying cry from enthusiasts and their supporters, a 
pithy statement for bumper stickers and T-shirts, a creed to hold on to in 
times of alienation from a world that doesn't get it. Aren't there enough 
unfriendly forces out there weighing on a high-schooler without the added 
misconceptions about something that is basically not illegal? 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Jeff, take it in stride. Others react in ways that emphasize their 
perceived outlaw image.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to argue that property doesn't get damaged," Jeff says. "It 
does. But I will argue that cities should build as many skateboard parks as 
they do places for baseball and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skateboarding is about being an individual. I don't want to be classified as 
'a skateboarder' or stereotyped. I'm just Jeff, and I skateboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for him, Jeff lives across the street from the county's only present 
public skateboard area, on the edge of Murdy Park in Huntington Beach. Less 
than half the size of the sandy jungle gym area nearby, it was the result of 
much lobbying by skateboarders and supporters. It's too tight an area to 
achieve the kind of acrobatic feats possible on a skateboard, but despite its 
limitations, it's become a must-stop among local and visiting riders. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction is part novelty. Public skateboard areas in this country are 
about as common as becoming president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is in the midst of constructing a second rink -- this one on the 
campus of Huntington Beach High. Twice as big as the Murdy site -- or, the size 
of a basketball court, as one city official described it -- and near the 
entrance to the football stadium, it will be ready for riding in late November. 
Rumors are flying among some high-schoolers that a class period like the one 
for the surf team is also under consideration at the school. But for now, 
according to school officials, the truth lives only in the wheeled fantasies of 
skateboarding teens such as Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
 Skateboarding, after all, is still far from attaining the kind of respectable 
status surfing has achieved. Unlike wave riding, skateboarding doesn't get 
classified as a sport among many sports editors -- some of whom deem shuffle 
board, Ping-Pong and badminton worth coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration takes over Jeff's expression. "Skateboarding is a sport. It's 
physical. We have contests all the time. I think skateboarding is worthy of an 
Olympic event." 
</P>
<P>
 While Seoul will do without skateboarding in '96, the wheels are already 
turning in the sport's favor on an international scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Amateur Skateboard League took a nine-member team to Russia 
last month to participate in contests and skateboard demonstrations held in 
conjunction with the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The teens stayed with other young skateboarders and their families in St. 
Petersburg. Among the pack was San Clemente High junior Josh Spencer, who has 
competed in monthly league-organized events from Temecula to Santa Barbara for 
the past three of his five years as a skateboarder. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience for Josh, 16, whose only venture before on foreign land had 
been to Mexico, was "rad," to say the least. "It was cool going to a country 
you couldn't have gone to a few years ago," says Josh. "Just experiencing a 
different culture taught us that kids are kids everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids in Russia proved more industrious, he admits. Although product is 
imported and manufactured there, it's an arduous effort to find anything. So 
they improvise. They carve, weld and saw their own parts. "It's what they have 
to do to skate," says Josh. "Everything was perfect. It blew my mind. It didn't 
even look homemade." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh toured St. Petersburg and Moscow on his board during the two-week visit, 
"communicating through hand signals and a lot of pointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Skating outside the Hermitage was thrilling, he recalls, but it wasn't just 
the monuments or the Winter Palace that will remain etched in his memory.  
</P>
<P>
 Russians of every age -- even older people, even police -- treated his 
skateboarding crew with an open enthusiasm that "tripped the whole team out." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a trend here in America to hate skateboarders," he says. "So it's 
weird going to a country where the people just got their freedom, and they 
don't care about skateboarding. They're cool about it. They've got other things 
to deal with. We could skate anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you come back to America and you get arrested for skating a curb. 
Everything is supposed to be so free here, and I get a $162 ticket for doing a 
kick flip at the pier at night. The cop acted like it was a sting operation. He 
tried to take my board." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh envisions an alternative attitude: Every town builds a skate park that is 
paid for by businesses that have pitched in the money once spent to post all 
those "No Skateboard" signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a freedom you feel when you're skateboarding," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you're not free to skate anywhere. Skateboarding shouldn't be a crime."

 If you followed World Cup soccer, you might want to lace up those cleats and 
try one of the following games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest of the trio is Accolade's Pele! I played the Sega version, and it's 
great if you like to control many of the variables. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to solid graphics and good control, Pele! gives you six game 
options: exhibition, practice, start tournament, continue tournament, start 
season and continue season. As the last two indicate, you can stop your team's 
season in the middle, then power up and resume it later. 
</P>
<P>
 One player can compete against the CPU, or you can invite a friend over. Pele! 
lets you pick teams, uniforms, change the level of important attributes such as 
offense, defense and aggression, and even substitute for players.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another solid effort that gives you a lot of control is Champions World Class 
Soccer.  
</P>
<P>
 CWCS has the best graphics and the most realistic game play. It's so realistic 
that when the goalie lets one get by him, he jumps up and down in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 You can select from among a one- or two-player exhibition match, begin a 
tournament or resume a previous tourney, using a password. You pick from among 
32 national teams, select from four formations and decide if you will control 
all, some or none of the goalie functions. If you pick none, the CPU will 
defend your goal. It does a nice job. 
</P>
<P>
 On the screen you have a clock showing time elapsed, the score and a "radar" 
feature that shows the position of all players on the field. I found that 
pretty useless, because it looks like a bunch of colored dots floating on a 
green background. Besides, if you take your eye off the field, your opponent 
steals the ball.

 The easiest to play -- and my favorite for that reason -- is World 
Championship Soccer II. 
</P>
<P>
 You can select an exhibition or a challenge round in which you play against 16 
increasingly tough opponents. You can also play any game -- and any team -- 
from the 1986, 1990 or 1994 world championship, or build your own championship 
tournament from 32 of the world's top teams. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't even like soccer, but this game is so easy to control that I won my 
first six matches, including a crushing 5-1 defeat of Sweden and a hard-fought 
2-1 overtime win against Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 You get all the options of a real game -- penalty kicks, overtime, corner 
kick, throw in, slide tackle. The graphics are large and clear and control is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a soccer fan, any of these carts will give you a good taste of what 
the real thing is all about. If you're not a fan, you might be converted. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that doesn't happen, take heart. Football season is just around the 
corner.

MY TURN: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; RIPPING THOSE CD PACKAGES

 Picture this: It's afternoon, and an executive at a CD manufacturing company 
is relaxing between meetings. Suddenly, a harried-looking young administrative 
assistant bursts through the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Smith! Mr. Smith!" she cries, obviously perturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it, Jane?" asks Smith, with an air of anger and curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible!" she groans. "The latest surveys have come in. The CD 
packaging -- it's, it's . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what?" exclaims Smith, already out of his chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's convenient and easy to get into!" 
</P>
<P>
 "No! This can't be happening. Call the boys down at the plant. Tell them to 
make those annoying little silver stickers that we put on the jewel boxes even 
stronger! And seal the cellophane tighter! We don't want anyone getting into 
those cases easily." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Well, that's what it seems like, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 CDs have gotten increasingly difficult to open. Granted, they were never easy 
to get into in the first place. In the old days, they came in large, unwieldy 
boxes, which were monstrously annoying. But all you had to do was rip and tear 
until a jewel box popped out. This concept was rendered obsolete, however, when 
the angry voices of environmentalists chimed in with those who complained that 
the boxes were too big for them to shoplift. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, CDs come in those little cases called jewel boxes, wrapped tightly 
in cellophane. Easy to get into? Ha! 
</P>
<P>
 Once you get past the wrapper, which sticks to the box like lawyers to an 
accident scene, there is a tiny silver sticker holding the box shut. This 
sticker, which is almost indestructible, has holograms on it advertising 
various manufacturing and recording companies. That's all well and good, but 
most of us want to get to the box and listen to the music. Thank goodness for 
power tools. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of mine has found a solution to this packaging debacle. He throws the 
case on the ground until it shatters. He then picks up the CD, which is usually 
undamaged (or so he hopes), and puts it in his CD carrying case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha! Showed you, Mr. Smith.

 Gary Mendoza -- In a story in Thursday's editions, a comment by California 
Department of Corporations Commissioner Gary Mendoza should have read: "I can't 
judge my performance based on how I'm being praised or criticized by any 
particular interest group. I think our department will be judged by our 
results."
