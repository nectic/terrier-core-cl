 "We count Jester Hairston as one of our patriarchs, one whose life exemplifies 
wisdom and an extraordinary spirit," said the Rev. James M. Lawson Jr., pastor 
of Holman United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, Hairston will be the guest of honor as Holman celebrates the 93rd 
birthday of its longtime member, who parlayed his grandmother's memories of 
slavery, a thirst for education and religious faith into a career in music and 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The church will present several choirs from around the city in a musical 
tribute at 7:30 p.m. Friday to the man whose long career has included 
composing, arranging and conducting music for Broadway, Hollywood and choirs 
worldwide. Hairston will conduct two of his songs. At 6:30 p.m. July 9, the 
church will host a birthday banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston's music is familiar to the Holman Choir and to choral groups 
everywhere. A noted authority on Negro spirituals and folk songs, Hairston's 
compositions include "Amen," which was made popular by the 1963 film "Lilies of 
the Field," starring Sidney Poitier. Also an actor, he played the Kingfish's 
brother-in-law Leroy in the "Amos 'n' Andy" television and radio shows, and had 
a part in the Johnny Weissmuller "Tarzan" films. More recently, he played the 
deacon Rolly Forbes on the television series "Amen" in the 1970s. But Hairston 
is primarily known as an arranger of African American choral music. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, it's easy to spot the milestones along Hairston's journey to 
success: cum laude graduation at Tufts University with a degree in music; 
graduate work at the Juilliard School of Music; assistant to African American 
conductor Hall Johnson in New York and then Hollywood, for the filming of 
"Green Pastures" and "Lost Horizon"; choral arranger for Russian-born composer 
Dimitri Tiomkin. Hairston holds honorary doctorate degrees from half a dozen 
universities.  
</P>
<P>
 But the road to recognition and honor was long and hard, he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston's family left Belews Creek, N.C., site of the plantation where his 
grandparents were slaves, when he was a baby. His parents had heard that blacks 
could get jobs in the coal mines and steel mills in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 His father died within a year of their departure and his maternal grandmother 
came from Virginia to help raise him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston fondly remembers summer afternoons in Homestead, Pa., just across the 
Monongahela River from Pittsburgh, when his grandmother and her friends would 
sing and talk about their lives as slaves in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listened to the old people until I was 18 and left for college," he says. 
"By then, I knew all the dialects of the different plantations. All their music 
and stories went into my brain." 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston says he was "determined to go to college because none in my family 
had gone." He kept quitting school to work when he ran out of tuition money, so 
it took him nine years to complete four years of college at the University of 
Massachusetts and at Tufts. He has lived in Los Angeles since 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he is conducting the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, as he did last month, or 
25,000 singers from all over Europe, as he did three years ago at the 
invitation of the Rev. Robert Schuller, Hairston says his gift -- and his 
challenge -- is "teaching white people to get it right -- the dialect and the 
nice swings, the rhythm." He is able to do so "partly from religious 
inspiration and partly from musical knowledge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston's wife, Margaret, died nine years ago. He lives in Windsor Hills with 
his stepdaughter and keeps close ties to his three grandchildren and four 
great-grandchildren. He enjoys traveling to regional reunions of Hairstons, who 
are not necessarily blood relatives but, like him, are descendants of Hairston 
Plantation slaves who bore the surname of their owner. Hairston keeps up a 
friendship with Peter Hairston of Belews Creek, the great-grandson of the man 
who owned his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston says, "genuine friendships based on the Bible" are what seem 
important to him. "I'm not a meticulous Bible reader," he said, "but I do 
believe in religion and have a little truck with the God that I serve, which I 
think is the God of all people, white and black. He looks after me when I'm not 
working and when I'm working."

IS THIS THE END OF THE $400 HAMMER?; DEFENSE DEPARTMENT PURCHASING IMPROVEMENTS 
CAN BE EXPECTED; MIRACLES, ALAS, CANNOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Probably no subject involving the military has provoked greater bafflement, 
derision, amusement or outrage than the purchasing polices so long followed by 
the Pentagon. The specifications drafted by the Defense Department's experts as 
a preliminary to ordering even the most commonplace products -- cookies, 
T-shirts, screwdrivers, light bulbs -- are often museum-quality examples of 
wretched bureaucratic excess. 
</P>
<P>
 The military buys scores of billions of dollars worth of goods every year. Few 
doubt that a large fraction of that money is wasted because of the costs added 
to products by unnecessarily detailed technical specifications. In one of the 
more welcome reforms of recent times Defense Secretary William J. Perry 
promises that much of this will now change. Indeed, he says, "we're turning the 
present system upside down." 
</P>
<P>
 How? Primarily by directing purchasing agents to begin using commercial 
standards in buying goods, in place of devising and imposing sometimes unique 
military requirements. In other words there will soon be a lot more buying off 
the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the Pentagon will now tell manufacturers what it wants in the 
way of performance, instead of providing precise instructions on how to make a 
product. A lot of commercially available products now easily meet military 
performance standards. For many, there will no longer be any need for special 
factories or assembly lines to satisfy military specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Significant cost savings are expected by the third year of the new program. By 
the 1998 fiscal year, to take an example, Perry expects a $700-million savings 
on the purchase of electronic subsystems for just one type of Army helicopter. 
Perry won't estimate the total potential cost reduction, but some analysts say 
up to $12 billion a year is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The procurement policy shift is recognition not only that the traditional way 
of buying things can result in waste but also that there have been major 
improvements in the quality of the many commercially made products the Pentagon 
will buy. 
</P>
<P>
 At least from World War II on, durability and reliability have properly been 
top considerations for the military, while the overhead costs of meeting 
military standards have been relegated to secondary consideration. In the age 
of tighter budgets, what was of secondary significance now inevitably and 
properly looms much larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the new policy mean the end of such fiascos as the $800 coffeepot and the 
$400 hammer? Rational purchasing improvements can be expected; miracles, alas, 
cannot. But if nothing else, trying to justify such outrages is about to be 
made infinitely harder. This is not a battle where total victory is possible. 
But at least a lot of ground can be gained.

THE BEACH YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- AND LOCAL GROUPS -- 
NEED TO HELP OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The long, hot summer has been with us officially for only a long and hot week 
and a half. As people flocked to Southern California beaches to seek relief 
from high temperatures and high entertainment costs, it was clear that the 
waterfront itself is under stress in these times of state, county and local 
budgetary shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 With the state balancing budgets on the backs of counties, some of the old 
waterfront relationships have been put to the test. But basically the answers 
to the problems of water safety and keeping beaches clean begin and end with us 
at the local level. It's worth thinking about as we embark on a weekend that 
combines the fun of summer with our annual festive salute to the nation's 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County took over lifeguard operations in the mid-1970s from cities 
to promote efficiency and uniform waterfront safety standards. That was a 
terrific arrangement for everybody as long as the money was there. Now, 
however, L.A. County is trying to get some of the beach cities to contribute 
more money toward those services, with mixed results. There apparently has been 
some progress in these negotiations, but fiscal pressures are causing sticking 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 While some cities have been contributing their share, others have been 
stubborn, even in the face of threats that the county might pull out lifeguard 
and cleanup crews. All of this is complicated by a hodgepodge of arrangements 
for sharing revenue from parking facilities along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, where the big beach cities actually provide their own 
lifeguards but are subsidized by the county, the county-town relationship is 
also being changed by fiscal circumstances. Orange County's system is similar 
to what L.A. County had before the consolidation of lifeguard service. But 
though the two counties have evolved different ways of getting the job done, 
both are feeling the same budgetary strains. Orange County now is saying that 
its subsidy of $248,000 yearly to cities for lifeguards is in jeopardy; the 
situation is reminiscent of L.A. County's suspension of its subsidy to Long 
Beach after Proposition 13 passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody is under the gun, but the waterfront localities, many of which have 
evolved beyond their small-town status of the 1950s to actively promote tourism 
and benefit from it today, need to do their part to contribute from the bottom 
up. And there is a way in which not only local government but ordinary citizens 
can help. Most beach-goers can't lend a hand in providing lifeguard service, 
which requires special training, but not much expertise is required in picking 
up after a day at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental groups have been way ahead of the wave in organizing 
cleanups, monitoring water quality and even taking personal pledges to leave 
beaches cleaner than they were found by taking away, say, five items of trash. 
But too many visitors to the shoreline are appallingly cavalier about tossing 
their refuse to the wind and sand, opting out of that short walk to a trash 
bin. The waterfront is a fragile environment, dependent on all of us as 
individuals and as fellow travelers along the shoreline for its continued 
quality of being a special place.

SENSE AND NONSENSE ABOUT ART FUNDING; ARTIST'S STUNT MAY HAVE BEEN OFF BASE, 
BUT SO WAS THE CONGRESSIONAL ATTACK IT PROVOKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Tailhook scandal was a disgrace to the Navy. The drunken debauchery and 
sexual exhibitionism that occurred on that occasion put the participants far 
outside the American mainstream. But would anyone propose that because of 
Tailhook the Navy be disbanded? 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Philip M. Crane, an Illinois Republican, recently proposed something 
almost that ridiculous for the National Endowment for the Arts. Because of a 
minor scandal at the NEA-assisted Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis, Crane 
proposed abolishing the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that in a performance at the Walker, an HIV-positive artist used a 
razor blade to carve a pattern into the back of another (HIV-negative) artist, 
blotted the pattern with a towel and then dangled the blood- stained towel 
above the heads of the audience on a clothesline. 
</P>
<P>
 We have our doubts -- let us say -- about the artistic merit of the 
performance, and we reiterate our view that when federal arts money is at issue 
the public will always expect and want that public money to be used sensibly. 
Those who accept and use public money, whether museums or major arts centers or 
even individual artists, have to understand and accept this expectation. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's put the Walker incident in perspective. The artist received only 
about $125 of the $104,500 the Walker Center received from the NEA in 1993. And 
the Walker Center money is itself a tiny fraction of the NEA's $171-million 
budget. Crane's amendment deserved the 313-113 trouncing it received on June 
24. In the end the House voted 98% of the funds originally appropriated for the 
NEA's 1994 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no reason, however, for even a token reduction. The NEA chairman 
cannot answer for every offensive artist any more than the secretary of the 
Navy can answer for every drunken sailor. Crane and the relatively small number 
of conservatives who agree with him are free to oppose the public funding of 
art on principle, though their arguments have not convinced Congress; that's 
democracy. But they are not free to distort the record of the NEA every time 
its budget comes under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress should focus on what the NEA typically supports: Body-carving is no 
more typical of the NEA than Tailhook is typical of the Navy. Pretending 
otherwise, Crane in his misguided efforts has wasted far more than the $125 the 
NEA spent on the object of his indignation.  
</P>
<P>
 No one likes to see public money wasted -- not in an arts center, but also not 
in the halls of Congress.

HEALTH CARE EXCLUSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My wife and I have Ph.D.s from elite institutions and we're hard workers; 
neither of us have ever had a problem gaining meaningful, reasonably well-paid 
employment. Under the current health care system and under any system that 
doesn't cover 100% of Americans, however, our family is subject to exclusion 
because we have a 5-year-old son, Jordan, with cystic fibrosis. Legislators 
talk blithely of incentives to insurers and employers so that health care 
coverage can be extended to as many as 96% of Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 Guess who won't be covered? That's right, our son Jordan won't be covered. Our 
current employer-paid fee-for-service policy has a lifetime cap of $850,000. 
Jordan is well on the road to exceeding that cap. Just one of his medications 
costs $10,000 a year, and he takes many. His several-day hospitalizations have 
averaged about $10,000 each. When genetic engineering treatments are available 
for his disease, the expenses will go up still more. It's just a matter of time 
before he is kicked out of the present "best-in-the-world" health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sorry but I get angry when legislators tell me that 96% coverage is the 
best they can come up with. If they claim that universal access can only be 
bought at the cost of quality of care, I will ask them why do cystics in 
Toronto, with access to health care guaranteed by the Canadian government, live 
an average of nine years longer than cystics in Boston? When countries much 
poorer than ours can offer universal access to health care services to their 
citizens, I don't see why the U.S. cannot do as well and still maintain an 
acceptable quality of health care.

 * The First Lady says it is "only fair" that all Americans have health care 
equal to that of Congress. This is called a "cheap shot" by Sen. Bob Dole (June 
23). Unlike the senator, millions of U.S. citizens have no taxpayer-funded 
health insurance. For them, Hillary Rodham Clinton just fired the cheap shot 
heard round the world.

 * We were aghast when we read "Brokering Votes for Health Reform Begins in 
Earnest" (June 17). That the basics of our health care system may be determined 
by special interest votes for the tobacco, oil and other industries is 
incomprehensible. To think that the bill can "be loaded down with unrelated 
goodies" such as lowering (proposed) taxes on tobacco products and giving tax 
breaks to the oil industry to get an apparently unpopular health care reform 
bill through Congress, and, incidentally, to assure reelection of congressmen 
and senators, is mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) is only accused of stealing a few hundred 
thousand dollars from the government. If the proposed health care plan is as 
disruptive, costly, and inadequate to the needs of the people as it is reputed 
to be, then our representatives who are willing to cast votes for it primarily 
to assure reelection are far more evil than he.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to proposed legislation (or, perhaps, an appeal to the 
Supreme Court) to restrict the content of a bill to the subject being voted 
upon?

<P>
 * Why is President Clinton more concerned about the 17% who don't have health 
care insurance instead of the 83% that are concerned about the economy, crime, 
welfare and inflation? The odds of reelection are nearly five times greater by 
satisfying the latter group rather than the former. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Recently, I received a campaign reelection letter from Republican Rep. Bill 
Thomas of Bakersfield. He writes that we have the finest health care system in 
the world and that Republicans in the House saved it from devastation. What a 
joke! It's true that America has one of the most advanced technological health 
care systems in the world, but as far as covering most citizens or collecting 
the monies for services rendered it ranks as one of the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently had a quadruple bypass at Bakersfield Memorial Hospital. The bill 
for this operation exceeded $75,000 and the bills keep coming. Luckily, I had 
100% insurance coverage, but what about those poor people who fail to have 
insurance?  
</P>
<P>
 I'm constantly threatened by collection agencies or medical establishments 
that insist on immediate payments. When I lived in Germany the patient never 
saw the bill and was never harassed after major surgery. I disagree with Thomas 
and many other Republicans suggesting that our health care system is the best 
in the world. Tell that to 45 million Americans who have no health insurance, 
while our politicians bathe in full health care benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 In Germany everyone is covered with 100% coverage and, yes, you can pick your 
own doctor. Sadly, most Republicans are feeding the public lies about what a 
democratic-socialist health care system really does. The American Medical 
Assn., major insurance companies that provide health care coverage and other 
political power groups oppose a socialistic health care program, because it 
prevents them from obtaining huge profits for their own personal gain. I 
support Bill and Hillary Clinton's universal health care program, because it 
provides health care for all Americans -- rich or poor.

RULING ON ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the Supreme Court's decision to let a lower court ruling on 
English-only in the workplace stand (June 21): 
</P>
<P>
 Three cheers for the highest court in the land. The justices' decision to let 
the lower court's ruling stand struck a blow against cultural separation and 
for English as a common language. Perhaps there is a chance for us to deal with 
the divisive multicultural and separatist movements that have plagued us in 
recent times.

ART REVIEW; RELOCATED LACE EXPERIENCES SOME FIRST-SHOW JITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The much-awaited relocation of Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (or LACE, 
as it is universally known) from a warehouse district in downtown Los Angeles 
to a storefront in the center of downtown Hollywood has finally been 
accomplished -- and not a moment too soon. Lately it had seemed that the 
venerable, artist-run alternative space was in danger of being completely 
forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The art scene has been metamorphosing dramatically during the 15 years that 
the nonprofit gallery has been in operation. Locally, nationally and 
internationally, the cultural landscape of 1994 would be unrecognizable to a 
time-traveling visitor from 1979. For much of that time LACE changed with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluidity is essential to the profile of an alternative space, since the 
seemingly inevitable institutionalization of art amounts to a cultural 
hardening of the arteries. That stale rigidity is what spaces like LACE are 
finally created to be alternatives to. 
</P>
<P>
 The liveliness of an alternative space depends on its ability to constantly 
reposition itself, in order to keep as many options as possible open for 
artists. In recent years, however, LACE has struggled to keep its artistic head 
above the churning water. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there have been individual programs of note. But, overall, the 
organization seemed stuck, responsive more to parochial or clubbish interests 
than to artists' clear-eyed assessments of the larger art scene, and of how to 
bust up the restrictions it inevitably imposes on our cultural life. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the organization's earlier relocation from the third floor above a 
bridal shop on downtown L.A.'s Broadway to a free-standing building in a nearby 
industrial warehouse district, the move to Hollywood was engineered with the 
help of the Community Redevelopment Agency. The shift to a highly visible 
street location on Hollywood Boulevard signals a welcome shot of revitalization 
for LACE. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still a good bit of work to be done, some of it on the reconfigured 
but still pleasantly scruffy building. More important, as the inaugural show 
attests, the exhibition program needs to sharpen its focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Architecturally, the structure is plainly well-considered in its redesign, 
while far from spit-and-polished; that mix is appropriate for an alternative 
space for art. The 4,000-square-foot storefront -- formerly a beauticians' 
school, wryly enough -- has been reconfigured by architect (and LACE board 
member) Frederick Fisher to create two exhibition galleries, a performance and 
film theater, a video gallery and office space. Ceilings are high, floors are 
plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller exhibition gallery in front is open and inviting, thanks to 
street-side glass walls that casually entice passersby to look inside. In the 
main exhibition gallery, reached through an unadorned yet monumental doorway, 
some of the building's original, Streamline Moderne detailing peaks through, 
acknowledging layers of past use. 
</P>
<P>
 The inaugural exhibition, elliptically titled "Nor Here Neither There," has 
been organized by a team composed of three artists (whose own work bears scant 
resemblance to one another) and by a curator for a major LACE patron. Artists 
Charles Gaines, Paul McCarthy and Stephen Prina, together with curator Fran 
Seegull, have, as the show's title suggests, abandoned all claims on a unified 
theme. Instead, each apparently chose a few artists whose work they admire, and 
here they all are. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection doesn't appear entirely random, though. The 13 artists are based 
in a variety of cities (mostly in the United States, but one in Vancouver and 
one in Berlin), and they work in just about every medium, including 
photography, video, performance, sculpture, painting and installation. 
</P>
<P>
 No singular artistic strategy is encountered within a single medium. 
Assemblage, for example, is as diverse as the grubby street-poetics of Nari 
Ward's jaunty "Sky Juice," in which an iron gate clotted with rags sports an 
umbrella festooned with melted-plastic soda bottles, and the spotless, low-tech 
computer-space implied by Chris Finley's eccentric stacks of synthetic 
paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The most captivating work is Stan Douglas' projected video, "Monodramas," 
which is accompanied by a group of 10 photographs with texts. The latter are 
like miniature shooting scripts, several of which are acted out in the brief 
video vignettes. Each less than a minute, the monodramas tell banal tales of 
random suburban encounters, all in gorgeously saturated color, and all 
strangely haunted (or haunting) in their peculiar ordinariness. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the "Monodramas" is like stumbling onto crime scenes. Douglas 
manages to pack each one with enough mundane but compelling detail to make a 
viewer curious, while also ensuring that no two viewers are likely to come up 
with the same interpretive story. 
</P>
<P>
 It's likely that "Nor Here Neither There" means to stand as a declaration of 
breadth, inclusiveness and multiplicity for LACE's program, which isn't a bad 
idea for an inaugural show. But, overall, neither is this a particularly 
memorable offering -- one that rivets attention and makes you eager for more. 
</P>
<P>
 To unravel its title: The show is, in fact, rather too close to being "neither 
here nor there" in feeling. You don't just consider the art; instead, it feels 
as if each work has been asked not merely to speak for itself, but to represent 
a constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 To recognize the particularity of different artistic voices is commendable, 
but the sense of singularity achieved by unforgettable exhibitions has been 
sacrificed. 
</P>

 Ballet Olympians: Johan Kobborg, a 22-year-old soloist in the Royal Danish 
Ballet, was announced Friday as the grand prix winner in the 1994 USA 
International Ballet Competition. Popularly known as the Olympics of Ballet, 
the competition, held this year in Jackson, Miss., has launched the careers of 
several major dance stars, including former winners Mikhail Baryshnikov (1969), 
Alexander Godunov (1973), Fernando Bujones (1974) and Amanda McKerrow (1981). A 
total of 22 medals were awarded this year, including four to U.S. competitors. 
In the senior division, Boston Ballet soloist Alexandra Koltun, 23, won a 
second place bronze medal, while Houston Ballet soloist Tiekka Schofield, 23, 
received a third place bronze. In the junior division, Pittsburgh-based brother 
and sister Simon Ball, 18, and April Ball, 16, won gold and silver medals, 
respectively. More than 130 professional and amateur dancers from 37 countries 
competed in this year's competition, which began June 18. The USA Competition 
is held in Jackson every four years; international competitions in alternate 
years rotate among Paris, Moscow, Helsinki and Varna, Bulgaria. MOVIES

 Holy Cast Change!: Val Kilmer will take over the role of the Caped Crusader in 
Warner Bros.' upcoming "Batman Forever," replacing Michael Keaton in the third 
installment of the Dark Knight saga. In announcing the cast change, Warner 
noted that Kilmer will also star in "future episodes" of the film series. 
Keaton's replacement comes as a surprise since casting for director Joel 
Schumacher's "Batman Forever" was virtually complete with Tommy Lee Jones and 
Jim Carrey as villains and Chris O'Donnell as Batman's sidekick, Robin. The 
film starts production Sept. 21. A statement released by Warners said Keaton 
had left the picture under "mutual agreement" with the studio and hinted that 
the actor feared being typecast by the Batman mantle. But insiders said the 
separation occurred when the studio would not match Keaton's demands for an 
estimated $15 million for the role. The first two "Batman" movies were huge 
box-office successes, with the second installment, "Batman Returns," posting 
the second highest opening weekend in film history.

 * 'True Lies' Disclaimer: Bowing to demands of several Muslim and 
Arab-American organizations that believe the film stereotypes Muslims as 
terrorists, 20th Century Fox has attached an on-screen disclaimer to its 
upcoming Arnold Schwarzenegger spy thriller, "True Lies," which reads: "This 
film is a work of fiction and does not represent the actions or beliefs of a 
particular culture or religion." The James Cameron-directed film has yet to be 
screened, but the Arab-American and Muslim groups sent a letter of protest to 
Fox, claiming they had heard that the plot involved terrorists who plant 
nuclear bombs in six American cities and pledge to ignite them one at a time 
until the American government agrees to remove its troops from the Middle East. 
Fox wouldn't comment on the story line, except to say that there are 
Arabic-speaking people depicted in a variety of roles. The studio stressed that 
no changes are being made in the film itself, which opens July 15. POP/ROCK

 Legal Tidbits: Singer Percy Sledge ("When a Man Loves a Woman") was given five 
years' probation, sentenced to six months in a Louisiana halfway house and 
ordered to pay more than $95,000 in back taxes Friday. Sledge pleaded guilty in 
April to tax evasion for failing to report more than $260,000 in income. . . . 
A book publisher has sued the widow of singer Roy Orbison, alleging she 
promised in 1989 to write his biography but has never submitted a manuscript. 
Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group alleges that Barbara Orbison received a 
$130,000 advance for the deal and had just under a year to deliver a 
100,000-word manuscript and a 16- to 32-page photo insert. She received at 
least two extensions, ultimately to July 1, 1992, but still has not submitted 
the goods, according to the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit. The publisher 
seeks to recover the advance, plus interest since August, 1992. . . . 
Meanwhile, the same publisher is being sued by Bianca Jagger, who has filed an 
$11-million lawsuit against author Christopher Andersen and Bantam over "Jagger 
Unauthorized." She claims the book, about her ex-husband, Rolling Stone Mick 
Jagger, contains false and defamatory statements about her. . . . Police said a 
pipe bomb exploded outside the Miami home of rapper Luther Campbell this week, 
barely missing his $50,000 Dodge Viper sports car. No one was hurt, and 
Campbell's home was not damaged. TELEVISION

JAZZ REVIEW; LINDA PETERSON BRINGS ALONG COUSIN FOR JAZZ BAKERY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Linda Peterson talks about getting together for a family jam session, she 
isn't kidding. The Minneapolis-based jazz singer, who made a rare appearance at 
the Jazz Bakery on Thursday night, can assemble a world-class band by just 
making a few phone calls to family members. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, she worked a duo with cousin Tommy Peterson, a veteran of 
the "Tonight" orchestra, on tenor saxophone. But she might easily have included 
brothers Ricky, who plays keyboards with David Sanborn; Billy, the bassist with 
the Steve Miller Band, or Paul, a former all-purpose singer-instrumentalist 
with Prince's ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical lineage doesn't miss a beat with Linda Peterson. A Carole 
King-styled pop vocalist when she first recorded for RCA in the early '70s, she 
has matured into a splendid jazz performer. Her voice has an appealingly burry, 
late-night edge, and her phrasing is rich with blues-tinged melodic 
alterations. Equally important, she sings with great respect for both music and 
lyrics. In the Mancini/Bricusse classic "Two for the Road," for example, her 
reading was fully cognizant of the connections between the song's unusual 
harmonies and its poignant story. "Love for Sale," in contrast, brought 
appropriately fierce rhythms to Cole Porter's sardonic lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Carmen McRae, Peterson is a good enough pianist to supply substantial, 
and fittingly intimate, self-accompaniment. Her chording was lush and sensual 
for ballads such as "Don't Explain" and crisply rhythmic in the boogie backing 
for "You Made Your Move Too Soon." If there was a problem, it was a tendency 
for Peterson to fill too many of the open spaces, to not allow her voice to 
always take the front and center position it deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Peterson's saxophone provided superb improvisational counterpoint. Not 
especially visible when he was one of the numerous faces in Doc Severinsen's 
talented crew of players, his solo interactions with his cousin's vocals 
brought a highly personal slant to the cool tones of the Lester Young/Stan Getz 
lineage. DON HECKMAN

ART REVIEW; THROUGH THE LENS OF IRANIAN CULTURE; TWO EXHIBITIONS AT UCLA'S 
FOWLER MUSEUM ENRICH IMAGES OF THESE IMMIGRANTS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In many ways modern art is the language of the misunderstood. In the beginning 
it was spoken by visionary bohemians and beats within this culture. Today, that 
language embraces and is embraced by immigrants, exiles and refugees sea-tossed 
to these shores by a world off its axis. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History addresses the issue of the modern 
outsider in two exhibitions that look at the art and life of Los Angeles' 
Iranian immigrants -- one a documentary photographic essay, the other works by 
immigrant artists. With an estimated population between 150,000 and 400,000, 
it's the most populous enclave outside Iran proper. 
</P>
<P>
 It has thrived here to create a subculture with its own periodicals, 
television and radio programming and artists of every stamp. The bulk of its 
membership is made up of educated, upscale professionals who fled to escape the 
Ayatollah Khomeini's fundamentalist revolution of 1979. Their run for freedom 
curdled into absurdity. Americans, angered and humiliated by the hostage crisis 
at the embassy in Tehran, turned the immigrants into the villains. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Ron Kelley spent five years documenting all this and more in a 
project that evolved into "Irangeles: Iranians in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's a national traveling exhibition of some 120 black-and-white 
photographs handsomely premiered at the museum and accompanied by a 400-page 
book-catalogue that amounts to an in-depth sociological study. Kelley, Jonathan 
Friedlander and Anita Colby acted as project editors and curators. The show was 
organized by the museum in conjunction with UCLA's Gustave E. von Grunebaum 
Center for Near Eastern Studies and its International Studies and Overseas 
Programs department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's photographic style has a populist flavor located somewhere between 
Robert Frank and Diane Arbus. That means it's a little funky and slightly 
inclined to exaggeration. It works well depicting a people whose appearance 
leans to the vivid. Kelley captures the disorientation of trying to fit into a 
new culture without losing cherished values. In non-propagandistic reality, 
that is bound to involve elements of comedy, pathos and courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures prove there is no one monumental Iranian character or sensibility. We 
see bikers and belly dancers, salesmen in silk suits and a turbaned Kurd at a 
picnic in the Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 There are women in traditional chadors and fashionable yuppies on Rodeo Drive. 
There is one taste for opulence and another for austerity. 
</P>
<P>
 There are Iranian Muslims, Jews, Bahais; Armenians, Assyrians and 
Zoroastrians. We see a dignified Iranian executive and his Japanese wife one 
second, an unruly protest against Saddam Hussein the next. There are 
traditional weddings and others in American style with little bride and groom 
figures on the cake. There are cops and hairdressers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's pictures have a welcome-to-the-rich-chaos-of-America touch that is 
tolerant and inclusive, but he doesn't forget tragedy. There is a recurrent 
feeling of enforced anonymity in pictures of people trying to have fun in the 
antiseptic precincts of rented hotel banquet halls and conference rooms. There 
is the repulsion of an American with her "Down With Iranians" sign. Then comes 
the horror of watching a young man named Neusha Farrahi burn himself to death 
in front of Westwood's Federal Building in 1987. Many Americans were not quite 
clear just what he was protesting. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kelley glimpses the epic, a simultaneous exhibition by four immigrant 
Iranian artists touches the intimate. It's called "Labyrinth of Exile: Recent 
works by Ali Reza Dadgar, Payam Farrahi, Taraneh Hemami, and Shirin Neshat." 
Its curators are Doran Ross, Betsy Quick and David Mayo.  
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary art styles have become so international, it's no surprise there 
is a certain familiarity about this work along with a certain exoticism.  
</P>
<P>
 With curious aptness, two of the artists work in variations on Assemblage, 
once the quintessential Outsider style here. Their use of discarded wood, 
paper, souvenirs and photographs makes us realize there can be moments in life 
when the only way to hang on to your identity is to stare at your passport 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Reza Dadgar evokes religious icons by blending graduation pictures, kid 
snapshots of himself, sweethearts and relatives into reliquaries of longing. 
Taraneh Hemami's art suggests the mourning historical consciousness of the 
German Anselm Kiefer in works that bring together dead leaves and broken 
mirror. Her most affecting pieces are books that collage detritus and 
occasional photos. Although abstract, turning the pages of "The Book of 
Martyrs" evokes destruction while "The Book of Secrets" whispers of romance. 
</P>
<P>
 All these artists bring the great tradition of Persian poetry to mind, 
perfumed and achingly romantic. Payam Farrahi is the most specific in slabs of 
porous stone bearing surreal scenes that resemble rubber stamps or copy machine 
imagery along with actual verse. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking ensemble here is Shirin Neshat's "Women of Allah." One of 
the oversize self-portrait photographs sums the whole. The head is well over 
life-size, but it is shrouded in a chador and covered with verse in Arabic 
script. Her large almond eyes show clearly outlined in black. Between them, 
nearly covering her nose, she holds an upright rifle barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fractioned second, this startling image informs Western viewers that 
their chances of understanding such a traditional Muslim woman are next to nil. 
She has been raised as a model of rectitude and told to be ashamed of her body 
as a sinkhole of temptation. Yet recently the leaders of her people have told 
her to take up arms and fight like a man. Neshat says, "I am very interested in 
the poetics of this contradiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the exhibitions are soaked in devotion and passion. 
</P>

WHY 'BLVD.' CAME TO END OF ROAD IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can we please get real: "Sunset Boulevard" did not close due to Faye Dunaway's 
reported lack of singing ability. It closed because the show itself had no 
"legs" (" 'Sunset Blvd.' to Be Closed; Dunaway's Singing Faulted," Section A, 
June 24). 
</P>
<P>
 Although the producers claimed an advance ticket sale of $4 million after 
Glenn Close's departure, that figure amounts to little more than five weeks of 
sold-out houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply speaking, Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted a Big Movie Star for his stage 
extravaganza and got one in Close. Unfortunately, the usually astute Lloyd 
Webber may have outfoxed himself. It would have been far easier replacing a 
stage star like Patti LuPone, rather than a Big Movie Star like Close. 
</P>
<P>
 By promoting the show as a star vehicle, the producer boxed himself into a 
corner: Few people bought tickets beyond Close's June 26 departure, a pattern 
that may very well be repeated when the show goes to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Sunset Boulevard" had any real popularity on its own, any number of 
experienced musical theater stars in their 40s and 50s could have stepped in -- 
they could have even pulled Betty Buckley from the London company, if only 
temporarily to keep the show going while another actress rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Dunaway, this talented actress is simply the latest addition to a long 
list of screen actresses who ventured into musical theater with indifferent 
results: Bette Davis (twice), Katharine Hepburn, Vivien Leigh, Maureen O'Hara 
and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD STEVENS

</P>
<P>
 To borrow a line from "Evita": "And who would underestimate the actress now?" 
The answer to that question seems to be the musical's composer, Lloyd Webber. 
First, he underestimated LuPone's ability to carry "Sunset Boulevard" on 
Broadway, when she had already proved herself by carrying the aforementioned 
"Evita" 10 years ago. Now, he has underestimated Dunaway's ability to carry 
"Sunset Boulevard" in Los Angeles, and so he has decided to close the show. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, I believe he has also underestimated the theatergoing public of 
Los Angeles. I think that if he was really unhappy with Dunaway's singing 
ability, he could have let Karen Mason, Close's understudy, play the role until 
a suitable "name" or "star" was found. By deciding to close the show, Lloyd 
Webber has underestimated not only the Los Angeles theatergoing public's 
patience but the show's ability to hold its own as well.

 How many more insults must we endure from the likes of Lloyd Webber? Why not 
send him and his formula musicals back to England? We don't need him! 
</P>
<P>
 We, after all, produced the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen 
Sondheim, Marvin Hamlisch and more. Let's look, for a change, into our own back 
yard for musical talent. There's no need to continually turn our unscarred 
cheeks to Lloyd Webber for him to mask and entertain his personal phantoms, 
whatever they are!

 Even though we have nominated her for Razzies six times in our 14-year 
history, and she has deservedly won twice (her over-the-top portrayal of Joan 
Crawford in "Mommie Dearest" still ranks as the penultimate Razzie 
performance), even we are shocked by the shabby treatment Dunaway has received 
at the hands of Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 A gifted, feisty actress who is more than willing to take risks, Dunaway and 
her track record deserve a greater level of respect than that which Webber has 
afforded either her or LuPone.  
</P>
<P>
 We are likely among the last people Dunaway might expect to find in her 
corner, but we are rooting for her in any action she takes against Lloyd 
Webber. Go get 'em, Norma Dearest!

 Having been one of the unfortunate many who paid to see "Sunset Boulevard," I 
can only envy those who will be lucky enough to be spared a miserable 
experience.

 I can't imagine why Dunaway was chosen to play Desmond in "Sunset Boulevard." 
She wasn't known as a singer. Ann Blyth would have been a more likely choice. I 
saw her during a light opera engagement in Long Beach several years ago, and 
she looked and sang beautifully.

 Dunaway is being extremely charitable in her description of Lloyd Webber's 
abrupt about-face ("Faye Dunaway Blasts 'Capricious' Lloyd Webber," June 25). 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway is a brilliant, dynamic performer who without doubt could have brought 
Desmond to life as no one has since Gloria Swanson. Lloyd Webber's careless 
disregard for commitment makes one wonder how he ever achieved his apparent 
status in the theater world. BETTE AMSLER

<P>
 Just reading between the lines, anyone with half a brain can tell that Lloyd 
Webber's decision to close "Sunset Boulevard" had everything to do with money 
and nothing to do with Dunaway ("Why They Closed 'Blvd.' and Rode Into Sunset," 
June 25). He cast her knowing how she sounded, and Dunaway, being the 
professional and perfectionist that she is, would be the first to pull out if 
she couldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway could talk-sing the role a la Rex Harrison and still become the 
definitive Desmond. So now Lloyd Webber has discarded and embarrassed both 
LuPone and Dunaway, not to mention depriving all of us from seeing these two 
great performances. JIM RADER

 Re "Like Father, Like Son" (Morning Report, June 24): Check any legitimate 
biography or legitimate Hollywood source, and you will see that singer Nelson

'WOLF' AND THE OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Kenneth Turan's review " 'Wolf' Man Jack in the Wilds of N.Y." (June 17), 
he comments that "Wolf" "meanders down several paths" from a story about office 
politics to a story about immortality to a horror story. Turan comments on the 
awkwardness of putting these unrelated themes into the same film. 
</P>
<P>
 But I feel the connection. To me, as a man who has spent many years working in 
a law office, "Wolf" taps into something very true. We businessmen experience 
pain and pleasure as passionately as an action hero. In our chests beat the 
hearts of wild animals; in our office politics we mark off our territory as 
ferociously as a wolf, and, yes, our lives often become horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a connection between the myth of animal empowerment and the office 
worker who feels a fire in his belly. The most enjoyable thing about "Wolf" is 
that it makes this connection.

GARDENING; WHOLE BOG; LANDSCAPERS FLOAT SOME IDEAS TO MAKE SOGGY SPACES BLOOM

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ann Thompson was tired of the traditional front yard of her Santa Ana house 
and decided to transform it into something private, attractive and different: a 
bog. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Thompson enjoys a secluded courtyard featuring a dramatic water garden, 
koi pond with tile waterfalls, and a bog garden. The 5- by 40-foot waterscape 
has a modern geometric design, with a courtyard wall forming part of the 
enclosure. The bog garden abuts the wall, softening the structure and adding 
color and visual interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people envision water lilies when they think of water gardens. But the 
landscape designer Thompson hired to transform her yard encouraged her to go 
beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Rue, head of the Rue Group landscape design firm in Fullerton, had 
personal experience with bog plants, having added a water garden to her former 
residence in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bog plants brought so many interesting delights to our landscape," Rue 
said. "There are so many choices, and these plants add interesting foliage, 
textures, flowers, and even attract wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 Rue remembers brilliantly shimmering dragonflies hovering over the bog garden. 
She also was surprised to see that small toads had moved in, and a bullfrog 
arrived one day to claim the aquatic landscape as his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson readily agreed to Rue's suggestion and now has more than 50 bog 
plants in her garden, in addition to seven water lilies and 60 koi, which swim 
in the adjacent pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Bog plants are those that grow in shallow water or very soggy soil, usually on 
the perimeter of a pond or lake. The definition is broadened to include aquatic 
plants, those that grow directly in water. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like water hyacinth or watercress, float with their roots extending 
directly into the water. Others are deciduous or evergreen plants ranging in 
height from less than a foot to eight feet or more. Some of the standard garden 
favorites, like callas and certain varieties of cannas and iris, also thrive in 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Most bog plants are grown for their foliage and produce either insignificant 
flowers or flower for just a few weeks in spring. Others, though, such as 
pickerel, bloom all summer. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need a pond or lake to include some bog plants in your landscape. 
Any body of standing water will do.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Thompson residence, for instance, an additional small bog garden was 
created in an old claw-foot bathtub on the patio. Callas, cannas and water iris 
thrive there in pots placed on bricks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no minimum size for a bog garden; even a container will work," said 
John Rasmussen, owner of Rasmussen Waterscapes. Rasmussen, whose headquarters 
are in the San Gabriel Valley, designs and installs water gardens and koi 
ponds. He is an enthusiastic advocate of bog plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They help break up the horizontal line of water and lily pads and carry the 
eye into the rest of the garden to tie in with the overall landscape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A water garden needs specific ingredients -- oxygenating grasses, water lilies 
and fish -- to create a healthy environmental balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Specific scientific formulas based on how much water is in the pond dictate 
the number of water lilies, bunches of grass and fish required to ensure the 
balance that leads to clear water and healthy plants and fish. An imbalance 
contributes to murky, brackish water, algae overgrowth, diseased or dead fish 
and an unattractive appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wild, a body of water has different depths. The shallow edges are host 
to rushes, grasses, small floating plants and other plants with root systems 
that flourish in water depths of one foot or less. 
</P>
<P>
 In re-creating a natural bog, you can make a ledge along the edges of your 
pond by stacking large blocks or bricks just inside the perimeter. Bog plants 
in containers can then be placed on the ledges. The tops of the containers 
should be just below the water's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some suggestions for planting and maintaining bog plants: 
</P>
<P>
 * Select a container appropriate to the ultimate size of the plant -- three- 
or five-gallon containers for large or medium-sized plants; one gallon for the 
small ones. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant in regular garden soil -- even clay is acceptable -- rather than 
potting mix. Place one inch of Nitrohumus or similar organic material in the 
bottom of the container to fertilize. Fill with garden soil. Add the plant, 
moisten and pack the soil and top with medium-sized gravel or builder's sand. 
Carefully lower onto a shelf or blocks so dirt doesn't spill out. 
</P>
<P>
 * During the growing season, prune according to plant's growth. Add 
fertilizing tablets formulated for aquatic plants according to package 
directions.  
</P>
<P>
 * Each spring, before the start of new growth, inspect your plants to see if 
they need attention. Repot if the plant has overgrown its container or needs 
fresh soil. Replenish mulch material and trim foliage and roots that may have 
gone astray.  
</P>
<P>
 By carefully selecting your plants, you can minimize the maintenance efforts 
and have time to sit back and enjoy the sights and sounds of a water garden. 
</P>
<P>
 And best of all, when the temperatures rise or the Santa Ana winds howl, you 
don't have to worry about watering these plants. Recommended Bog Plants LOW 
(One foot or less)  
</P>
<P>
 * Pennywort (Hydrocotyle umbellata) 
</P>
<P>
 * Spiked rush 
</P>
<P>
 * Water clover 
</P>
<P>
 * Watercress (Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum) MEDIUM (One to three feet)  
</P>
<P>
 * Azure pickerel plant (Pontederia lancifolia) 
</P>
<P>
 * Chinese water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) 
</P>
<P>
 * Miniature papyrus (Cyperus haspan vipiparus) 
</P>
<P>
 * Graceful cattail (Typha augustifolia) 
</P>
<P>
 * Japanese arrowhead (Sagittari japonica) 
</P>
<P>
 * Zebra grass TALL ( Four to eight feet)  
</P>
<P>
 * Calla (Zantedeschia) 
</P>
<P>
 * Common cattail (Typha latifolia) 
</P>
<P>
 * Water iris papyrus (Cyperus papyrus) 
</P>
<P>
 FAST These plants are such vigorous growers or spread so easily throughout the 
pond or even in dry soil that some bog gardeners advise against including them. 
If you decide their virtues outweigh their aggressive growth, be prepared for 
continual maintenance.  
</P>
<P>
 * Parrot feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum) 
</P>
<P>
 * Umbrella palm (Cyperus alternifolius) -- freely seeds throughout the 
landscape 
</P>
<P>
 * Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) -- can be confined in a small tub or 
container and repeatedly thinned

TRENDS; IT'S NOT ALWAYS CRYSTAL-CLEAR, BUT GLASS MAKES THE CUT IN DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET KINOSIAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In simple accents and detailed crafting, in ways as diverse as 
light-refracting bevels and etched wildlife images, decorative glasswork is 
increasinglybeing used as a design element in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 There are scores of ways to glorify glass; it can be leaded, beveled, painted, 
enameled, antiqued, embossed. Many of these techniques remain unchanged since 
Medieval times, though the glass itself is appearing in new and modern designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, what makes the difference in glass, lifting it from something purely 
utilitarian to an art form, is the skill which the craftsman brings to the 
glasswork project," said Tom Henry, a glass craftsman of 24 years, who owns and 
operates Master's Glass in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have a piece of antique glass from Europe for $5 to $10 a square 
foot, or you can have a beveled, leaded, diamond-cut huge window or set of 
doors for $10,000. Both are lovely and give beauty to an environment; one just 
requires a lot more time and skill and craftsmanship. But anyone can enjoy 
glass in their home." 
</P>
<P>
 Decorative glass can be introduced in ways as simple as replacing the standard 
glass in a curio cabinet with antique glass or hanging a piece of stained glass 
in a window. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most people consider decorative glasswork a luxury, according to Tom 
Lloyd, owner of Bevelled Glass and Mirror in Newport Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the business since 1976, and you can see the curve go up and 
down with the economy," he said. "But I also think people are seeing the art 
form in glasswork and are willing to pay what a craftsman needs to do the job 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 The glasswork that Lloyd and Henry are talking about is meant to add lasting 
beauty to a home.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a beautiful coat one will wear for decades -- you'll be willing to 
pay a (higher) price for it," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 In doors, cabinets, windows and furnishings, the pieces are able to introduce 
detail that can transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. A decorative 
piece of glass in a door or an entryway, for instance, can help set a tone for 
an entire home. 
</P>
<P>
 Decorative glass can be purchased ready-made or custom-designed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready-made beveled and leaded glass doors for the entryway in one Orange 
County home were purchased from a glass and mirror retail company for about 
$1,600 for the pair. The doors were crafted in Latin America, the glasswork 
beveled and leaded in Taiwan, and the pieces put together by a Compton company. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a pair of custom doors in leaded and beveled glass with 
complex etching at another home were worked on by a local glass artist for 
three months before they could be set in their teak frames. The cost was 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Choices in decorative glass range from utilitarian frosted glass to unorthodox 
free-form compositions.  
</P>
<P>
 There are three main elements in decorative glass: 
</P>
<P>
 * How the glass is made. Variations include hand blown or machine rolled, 
clear or colored, textured or plain. 
</P>
<P>
 * What is done to it. Decorative processes include etching, cameo cutting, 
engraving, painting and enameling. 
</P>
<P>
 * How it is put together. Assembly processes include connecting pieces with 
leading, copper foil or zinc. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing some of the terminology of glass can help consumers considering adding 
glass detail to their homes to know what their options are. 
</P>
<P>
 Glass Types 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some basic kinds of glass:  
</P>
<P>
 Sheet glass. Generic plate glass from one-sixteenth of an inch to one inch 
thick. It is priced according to thickness, from $1.25 to $20 per square foot.  
</P>
<P>
 Antique glass. Hand-blown or machine re-creation and elaboration of the 
nuances in genuine antique glass. Bubbles, variations, striations and what some 
might term "defects" are deliberately included in the process. From $2.50 to 
$12 per square foot, depending on process. Opalescent glass. Color is mixed 
into the glass as it is created, then poured and rolled into sheets. This is 
the style of glass used in Tiffany lamps. From $2.50 to $10 or more per square 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalle-de-verre glass. Blocks or chips of glass cast in a resin to create an 
abstract form used in contemporary designs, particularly windows.  
</P>
<P>
 Fern glass. A special glue is applied either in a design or all over the 
surface of glass that has been sandblasted. The glue pulls the glass off in 
shapes of ferns, shells, etc. Double fern glass is a repetition of the process 
that gives the glass a double-chipped texture. Runs from $3 to $15 a square 
foot.  
</P>
<P>
 Rolled or textured glass. The glass is rolled in large sheets in various 
textures. Available in varied patterns, colors and degrees of transparency. 
Also referred to as Cathedral glass.  
</P>
<P>
 Flash glass. Generally hand blown. An antique glass with a thin layer of 
colored glass fused onto its base. 
</P>
<P>
 Stained glass. Paint and silver stain are used to define an image on pieces of 
colored or clear glass that is then leaded together. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a person wants a true Old World look, stained glass is one of the older 
processes," Henry said. "The old church work was stained glass -- pictures 
painted onto the glass in order to tell a story to those who could not read." 
</P>
<P>
 Frosted glass. Acid or sandblasting has been used to opaque the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Processes 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some key ways that pieces of glass are connected: 
</P>
<P>
 Leading. Pre-measured and cut glass pieces that look much like pieces of a 
dress pattern or an intricate puzzle are bound together with lead. 
Waterproofing putty is always placed between the glass edges and the lead to 
help in preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Copper foil. Strips of copper foil ranging in width from one-eighth of an inch 
to an inch depending on thickness of the glass are wrapped around the edges. 
The pieces are then placed together and the joint is soldered on top of the 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Bracing. Metal braces are needed to keep a window from sagging or bowing. This 
is especially important on large pieces or those that will be subject to 
movement, such as in a door. Some craftsmen prefer to incorporate the braces 
into the design, others prefer a straight-across bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 Decorative Processes 
</P>
<P>
 There are many ways to cut or etch glasswork. Here are some: 
</P>
<P>
 Beveling. The glass is cut or shaped on the edges on a slant or incline. 
Beveled glass is what is often used in leaded glasswork, and can be quite 
thick. The beveling technique provides the refraction of light that is so 
intense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beveled glass is beautiful, and lends itself to many different styles and 
periods of decor," Henry said. "It became particularly popular around the turn 
of the century. Combined with other processes -- such as sandblasting or 
diamond-cut work, it has added beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Acid etching. The glass is obscured by a solution containing hydrofluoric 
acid, which rapidly attacks the glass and dissolves its surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond-point engraving. Done entirely by hand, using a small diamond bit set 
in a holder similar to a pen or pencil. Allows the user to sculpt the surface 
of the glass.  
</P>
<P>
 Sandblasting. A jet of abrasive material is projected onto the glass surface. 
The force of the impact of the abrasive chips a fine, granular texture into the 
natural or polished surface of the glass. In glasswork, the abrasive used is 
usually not sand, but rather a very fine grit of aluminum oxide.  
</P>
<P>
 Painted glass. Ceramic enamels, matte-type finishes and silver stain are used 
to "paint" glass. Enamel is a hard, glossy coating, in opaque white or colors. 
Staining uses an oxide or chloride of silver to create a yellow tone. Matte 
finishes are created by applying and removing parts of the paint to allow light 
to come through certain areas. Generally, glass painting is done at a light 
table, with the artwork or drawn design placed on the underside of the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Brilliant cut work. Done using rotating wheels that deeply score the surface, 
creating polished prisms that increase light play. Cut glass is well known in 
work such as Waterford crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 French embossing. Acids or sandblasting combined with wheel work or brilliant 
cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 Copper wheel engraving. Done by holding the blank glass against a lathe-like 
machine fitted with grinding tools. Stuben glass is a good example of the 
delicate, intricate forms possible with copper wheel engraving.

DESIGN; IT'S OK TO BE MIXED UP -- ECLECTICISM IS WITHOUT MATCH AS STYLE 
STATEMENT

 The glamorous striped love seat could be from the '30s or '40s. In front sits 
a much less formal antique wicker cocktail table. To one side of the love seat 
is an elegant gilded armchair upholstered in what looks like faded blue denim. 
On the other is a French chair with a completely different finish, a 
whitewashed look. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, the room would have been a design nightmare. Now the mix is the 
height of style, part of Ralph Lauren's new Marseilles collection. 
</P>
<P>
 A major trend, mix and match, has taken over home design. 
</P>
<P>
 But call it mix and mix or mix and mismatch -- that's how far the new 
eclecticism has gone, as gingham marries happily with floral patterns and 
pewter is used to accent mahogany dining room chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 A full-page ad for Pier 1 Imports shows four different chairs pulled up to a 
dining room table and asks, "Who says everything has to match?" Who indeed? 
</P>
<P>
 In New York restaurants, the hottest look is a different china pattern for 
every place setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The current style seems driven by what people are actually doing in their own 
homes -- not just what furniture designers and interior decorators are 
dictating. A living room might be a collection of a couple of chairs the owners 
inherited, a contemporary sofa they fell in love with because it was so 
comfortable, a second-hand Oriental rug and some flea market finds. Somehow the 
mix works, and furniture designers are turning it into one of the most 
important trends of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're into eclecticism for the long haul," says Nancy High, director of 
communications for the American Furniture Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "conspicuous-consumption '80s," she says, people with money collected 
singular pieces of furniture they loved. "It cracked the old notion of 
everything having to match. Now collecting has moved down to the middle class 
as a means of self-expression." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of going out and buying a seven-piece bedroom suite the way their 
parents and grandparents did, many people are surrounding themselves with 
pieces of furniture they love, acquired over time. If they do go out and buy 
their furniture all at once, they want the acquired look, so they deliberately 
buy mismatched pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The new eclecticism differs from the old eclecticism only in how far it goes. 
It was always OK to mix periods if you did it properly -- but it was understood 
that certain styles mixed well and others didn't. You might mix patterns, but 
there was always a unifying element. 
</P>
<P>
 Now just about anything goes, as long as it gives you the feeling you want. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the trend toward eclecticism is the value Americans put on 
comfort these days. According to spokesmen and designers, the single most 
important consideration for people furnishing their homes these days is 
comfort. Many people are spending more time at home and don't want to replace 
the things they're comfortable with, even for high design. 
</P>
<P>
 They're also being exposed to many different styles to fall in love with. 
</P>
<P>
 Tastes have become more sophisticated because of factors ranging from the 
proliferation of shelter magazines to the fact that Americans travel more. 
Affluent Americans have become more used to seeing rooms that reflect a unique 
style, so they're more confident about doing it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Here at home, they're buying treasures from flea markets and antique shops. 
And they want to have these things around them to express their individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 According to experts, it can work for just about everyone. But if you aren't 
an interior designer, you might want to follow these rules for mixing and 
matching. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Warner, editor in chief of Metropolitan Home, suggests adding one piece 
at a time. When she redecorated her bedroom, she would bring in an acquisition, 
live with it, move it around, before she added anything else. "I let it settle 
in," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore designer Madeleine McComas of Arnot & McComas points out that the 
range of possibilities for mixing fabric patterns is much greater now than even 
three or four years ago. Let the fabric houses' guides to coordinating fabrics 
steer you away from trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pick a unifying theme, a glue that holds," says Stiles Colwill of 
Colwill-McGehee Antique, Decorative and Fine Arts. For instance, good design 
can be the cohesive element: "When you're mixing old and new, quality can hold 
it together." Or a color scheme, or a texture, can tie an eclectic room 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the best way to avoid the "Granny's attic" look is to pay 
attention to proportion, balance and scale. "If you have a room with 
overstuffed furniture," says Jay Jenkins of Alexander Baer Associates, "you can 
bring in a funky accessory as long as it's the same weight and strength."

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; ODOR BLOCKER AND PAINT MIGHT MASK PET SMELLS

 Q The former owners of our house let their dogs and cats occupy one of the 
lower kitchen cupboards, which has left a very offensive odor. I've repainted 
the inside of the cupboard, but that hasn't helped. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 B.B. San Juan Capistrano * 
</P>
<P>
 A There are a few things you can try but no simple solutions, says Jim Grant 
of Dutch Boy Home Decorating Center in Santa Ana. You can remove the paint 
you've applied, then wash down the inside of the cupboard with a solution of 
bleach and water. After it's dry you can try applying an odor blocker, which 
you might find at a pet store. You can also try painting the cupboard with an 
oil-based paint. 
</P>
<P>
 One old painter's trick is to take pure vanilla extract, preferably the kind 
found in Mexico because it's so strong, and mix it in with the oil-based paint 
to mask the smell of the paint. It also may work on your pet odors. 
</P>

 Q Is there any cleaner available that will remove stains from aluminum shower 
doors and tub enclosures? 
</P>
<P>
 T.M. Mission Viejo * 
</P>
<P>
 A There are two products nearly everyone has in their homes that can do this 
kind of job, says Tammy Griffith of B & D Glass & Mirror in Orange. Make up a 
solution of vinegar and water in a spray bottle, and go over the aluminum with 
fine steel wool. If the aluminum has a color, it's probably anodized, and 
you'll have to be careful with the steel wool. Try it first on an inconspicuous 
part of the door. Vinegar is an excellent choice to remove hard-water deposits 
and spotting. You can even use it on your shower glass.

 Q I've got an old hose bib outside that I'm trying to replace, but it seems as 
if it's almost locked on. Are there any tricks to getting it off? 
</P>
<P>
 S.R. Huntington Beach * 
</P>
<P>
 A First, you'll have to determine whether it's screwed on or soldered on, says 
Steve Johnson of Familian Pipe & Supply in Costa Mesa. If it's locked into 
place, you're probably better off having a professional come out with a torch, 
melting the solder and replacing it. If it's screwed on, use a wrench on the 
bib and another on the pipe so it doesn't turn. If you're then able to get 
enough leverage, the bib should turn on the threads. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q The house we just bought has an air-conditioning unit outside and a gas 
furnace in the attic space. Where would the filter be? Does each unit have its 
own filter? 
</P>
<P>
 F.N. Anaheim * 
</P>
<P>
 A There should be just one filter at the furnace site, says Tom Houlihan at 
Orange County Appliance Parts in Garden Grove. It's usually just below the 
furnace. Once a year, though, you should check the air-conditioning condenser 
unit outside, making sure the exterior is clean and debris-free. This is 
especially important when you have pets, because pet hair tends to collect in 
corners, where these units are often installed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q We have a log cabin in the mountains and have always applied log oil on it 
twice a year. We're thinking of painting the exterior but have been told the 
logs will need an expensive sandblasting beforehand. Is there another solution? 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. Seal Beach * 
</P>
<P>
 A You may be able to paint by just skipping the oil treatment, says Allen 
Howell of Imperial Paint in Fullerton. As long as the surface is dry, you can 
apply a good oil-based exterior primer, then use an oil- or water-based finish 
coat. Test the log surface by splashing a little water on it. If the water 
soaks in, that means the wood is porous and it's probably dry enough for the 
paint job. If it beads up and runs off, skip the next oil treatment and check 
it again in a few months.

 Drawing from the patterned skins of exotic African creatures, crystal design 
artist Kjell Engman answers the call of the wild with his interpretation of the 
skins on candlesticks, vases, bowls, mugs and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Safari series from Kosta Boda is meant to bring a little of life on 
the wild side into the often restrained world of crystal design. Pieces in the 
series, which are handblown, have pigment powders added to the glass to create 
the pattern and cost from $125 to $475. 
</P>
<P>
 Engman, who has been associated with Kosta Boda since 1978, is known for 
finding new perspectives for everyday items. "The color scale is in emotional 
harmony with the motifs I am working on in the 1990s, particularly in 
portraying the supernatural," Engman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safari series can be bought at the company's Orange County store, Orrefors 
& Kosta Boda Crystal Galleri at Crystal Court in Costa Mesa. Call (714)

 A trendsetter in the towel business for more than 55 years, New York-based Jay 
Franco and Sons Inc. is at the forefront again, with merchandise featuring the 
Power Rangers, Flintstones and Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The next trend, according to vice president Joe N. Franco, will be spinoffs 
from the motion picture "The Mask," which is due out later this month.

LIGHTING; ILLUMINATING TIPS TO SAVE ON UTILITY BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saving money on your utility bills can be as easy as changing a light bulb. 
</P>
<P>
 Incandescent lighting illuminates most homes today. Unfortunately, it's the 
most expensive, inefficient way to light your home. Only 10% of the electricity 
is used to produce light, while the rest becomes heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Halogen bulbs produce more light at the same wattage and are 1 1/2 times more 
energy-efficient than incandescent. Providing a white, bright light, halogen is 
suitable wherever high quality light is needed, such as in a reading lamp or an 
outdoor security light. The bulbs last about 2,000 hours, twice as long as a 
typical incandescent. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest news in home lighting today is undoubtedly the glare-free compact 
fluorescent tube folded into a U-shaped bulb. It can be adapted to most 
existing light fixtures. Compact fluorescents with a high color rendition index 
(CRI) illuminate colors accurately, and their warm white tones are similar to 
incandescent. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, an 18-watt fluorescent compact gives the same amount of light as 
a 75-watt incandescent, using 75% less electricity and lasting for an average 
of 10,000 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Lighting Assn. estimates that if every household in the United 
States replaced just one incandescent bulb with a compact fluorescent, the 
electricity saved in a year would equal the amount generated by one large power 
plant, says Barbara McCabe, association representative. 
</P>
<P>
 You can buy light fixtures designed specifically for compact fluorescents or 
adapt incandescent fixtures with an electronic ballast that will provide 
instant on-off and eliminate flickering and the annoying hum normally 
associated with fluorescents. 
</P>
<P>
 Compact fluorescent bulbs cost from $12 to $24, but they save money in the 
long run because they use less electricity and last longer, says Keith Voight 
of the Edison Electric Institute in Washington, D.C. Voight suggests compact 
fluorescents for high-use areas where they will be on more than two hours a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 High-intensity discharge (HID) is another energy-efficient lighting option 
used primarily outdoors in security floodlights or decorative landscaping 
lights. Mercury vapor and high-pressure sodium HID lights have a golden hue, 
while metal halide lights are white. They last from 20,000 to 24,000 hours.

GARDENING; CULTIVATING FRIENDS: PLANT BUDDIES LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIENNE COOK, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Companion planting allows the gardener to become a matchmaker with plants, 
turning strangers into fast friends. The practice of companion planting goes 
back centuries, driven by the abiding belief that some plants do better when 
grown near other species, either for protection from pests or as a result of a 
chemical interaction beneficial to at least one of the partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique is unproven scientifically, although in its quaintness it may 
have merit, especially because each gardener's preferences provide gardens of 
diversity and character. 
</P>
<P>
 In one plot, the aim might be to attract birds, in another, to repel raccoons. 
Companion planting in the modern garden is generally a casual undertaking, with 
few rules and an openness to new ideas and combinations. In fact, one of its 
basic truths is that where a combination might fail in one garden, it could 
prove indispensable in another. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people, whether they are new to gardening or have many seasons behind 
them, are familiar with the marigold's reputation for warding off all manner of 
insect pests above and below the ground. Although this reputation may be 
overblown, it goes to the basic concept of companion planting: Plant marigolds 
among your vegetables, and you'll have fewer bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Marigolds, in field tests and in lab trials, seem to have a pretty good record 
in controlling damaging subterranean nematodes that invade plant roots. 
</P>
<P>
 But in most cases, no one knows why something does better when planted near 
something else. One gardener swears that planting radishes around her beans 
controls Mexican bean beetles. I have tried this and have seen little effect on 
the voracious bean pests. 
</P>
<P>
 While the variables from one garden to the next will dictate much of how 
successfully companion planting works, there are some fundamental principles 
that are universal and have been proved: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't plant tomatoes, eggplant and potatoes close together. All members of 
the nightshade family, they tend to share pests. Thus, if the potato beetle 
finds your eggplant near the potatoes, the pest probably will afflict the 
eggplant. Some gardeners find that eggplant is more vulnerable to beetles than 
are potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't plant parsley, carrots and cilantro near each other. These also share 
a family tree and the pesky carrot fly. Its grub prefers to tunnel into the 
carrot but will go to parsley and even cilantro if they are close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do interplant onions, radishes and even -- yes -- marigolds with other 
garden varieties. Apart from the practical aspect of sneaking space-saving 
onions and radishes among larger plants -- they rarely compete with companion 
plants, and they do very well in the smallest of spots -- they emit an odor 
that is repugnant to a wide range of insect pests. Ordinarily, radishes and 
onions are pulled before they bloom. However, if they are left to mature, their 
flowers are most attractive to predatory insects that prey on pests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do combine dissimilar species. Eggplant with beans; corn with potatoes; 
lettuce and basil with tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do intermingle herbs with vegetables. With the exception of fennel, nearly 
all herbs offer aid to garden plants by attracting predatory insects, repelling 
pests or simply providing a compatible growth habit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do interplant flowers with vegetables. These will attract birds and insects 
that prey on many pests. The classic example of this is nasturtium, with its 
peppery, edible foliage and its aromatic, edible flowers, themselves a magnet 
for hummingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Worth a try: Plant bush beans among tomatoes. I did this a couple of years 
ago and was delighted with the beans' ability to keep down weeds. In addition, 
they will fix nitrogen in the soil, providing an important nutrient to 
tomatoes. As a living mulch, low-growing bush beans ensure an even moisture 
content in the soil, important in the prevention of blossom-end rot in 
tomatoes. One caveat on this companionship, however: My bean crop was poor, I 
think because the tomato vines robbed the beans of their full measure of 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Worth a try: Combine corn with pumpkins, melons or other climbing squashes. 
The rough foliage of the squashes is reputed to dissuade raccoons from invading 
the corn at the time ears are ripening. The corn is thought to deter the squash 
vine borer moth from laying its eggs on pumpkin vines. The squash shades the 
ground around the corn and even climbs up stalks but does not hinder the corn's 
growth and development.

ARTISANS; SCULPTOR FASHIONS ART FROM HIS FOREBEARS' TOOLS OF THE TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN S. SALADYGA, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>

<P>
 "People want a piece of this country," says sculptor and designer Arnold 
Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone wanting a piece may have to see Goldstein first, because judging 
from his cramped Manhattan studio, he seems to have most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The country that Goldstein refers to and that has inspired his art is one in 
which cowboys rode the range and the buffalo roamed. It was in this rough, 
unchartered territory that we sometimes romanticize as the Old West that our 
predecessors carved hard, self-sufficient lives with tools and implements 
forged by hands rather than machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Blocking out the walls in Goldstein's 1,600-square-foot studio are hundreds of 
those tools. There are 500 pieces, some dating to the 18th Century, but at one 
time there were 2,000. "I got rid of the mistakes. I got rid of the learning 
ones," Goldstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 The tools that remain form tapestries of ancient iron and wood that ironically 
create the stark visual impact of modern art. Fish and eel gigs used for 
spearing fish, rug beaters, antique hacksaws and numerous other rudimentary but 
ingenious tools have been transformed by Goldstein into mini-sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond their artistic applications, the tools have personal implications. 
Goldstein's nine-year quest for antique tools "backs up to my father. He was 
very mechanical. He worked as a machinist in the Brooklyn Navy Yard," says 
Goldstein, who was born in the Bronx and moved to Florida as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 Uprooted in his youth by his parents' divorce, Goldstein felt further cut off 
from a familial history when his father's tools were given away after his 
death. Although Goldstein never recovered any of the tools, symbolically he 
did. "I finally got my father's tools. They made me feel like I had roots," he 
says of his collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning rusting metal into art is the latest turn Goldstein's career has 
taken. Innumerable other remnants and reproductions of the past crowd the floor 
and corners of his studio. Antique spurs, belts, holsters and leather chaps are 
interspersed with an array of modern-day Western jewelry, hardware and 
sculptures inspired by the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the typical boyhood infatuation with cowboys, Goldstein's interest 
in Western design and lifestyle was inspired by a chance encounter in 1968 with 
a then-unknown fashion designer named Ralph Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during a project designing the interior of a men's clothing store that 
Goldstein, who has a degree in architecture, ran into Lauren. The young 
designer, who was pushing a line of ties, happened to notice a bola tie and 
belt buckle Goldstein was wearing. Ten years later, Goldstein was invited to 
design a line of belt buckles and bola ties for Lauren's first Western 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Goldstein has been designing his own line of pewter and silver 
Western jewelry, and two years ago he added his Western-motif Wrought in 
America series of pewter hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite the many forms his art takes, the theme is the same, Goldstein 
says. "It has to do with belonging, with roots." His works, he says, are 
"little caresses of the past, nourishing touches" that provide "a window of 
what we are made of and where we came from."

HOBBIES; SHUTTERBUGS LOVE FLOWER PHOTOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Professional photographer Leonard G. Phillips has been focusing on flower 
photography for the past several years. Here are his suggestions for capturing 
flowers and plants on film. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the light. Shoot on cloudy days, or the hour after dawn or before 
dusk. Bright, sunny days have too much contrast for film to handle well, 
resulting in overexposed highlights, washed out color, or black shadows lacking 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a tripod. Your natural-light pictures will be sharper for it, and in 
garden photography, the subject isn't going to escape while you set up. Tripods 
allow the use of slower shutter speeds, so you can use smaller apertures to get 
greater depth of field with more of the subject in focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoot on calm, windless days. If the plants and flowers are blowing around, 
you're forced to use faster shutter speeds. Wind is another reason to shoot at 
dawn or dusk -- these times are typically the least windy. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay attention to the background. A good background enhances the subject, while 
unwanted objects or colors can ruin a picture. After composing your shot, try 
zooming the focus from foreground to infinity, scanning for unwanted 
components. Often, adjusting the depth of field to render the unwanted shapes 
out of focus can solve the problem, as long as the colors work. Remember, if 
you don't have a good background, you don't have a picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Use depth of field creatively. Use shallow depth of field to focus attention 
where you want it or to "abstract" the background into color patterns. Use deep 
depth of field to exploit interesting compositional elements at different 
distances from the camera. Ask, "What purpose will the depth of field serve in 
this picture?" If you have a depth of field preview button on your camera, you 
have a most useful tool -- take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Check for strays. You may want to remove insects, debris or dirt from the 
subject. It's easy to miss these when you're concentrating on composition and 
technical matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Bracket your shots. As the saying goes, film is relatively cheap, and great 
pictures are priceless. You can rarely go back and recapture the same shot, so 
protect yourself from improper exposure by taking pictures with aperture 
openings at what you think is the right setting and at one on either side. 
</P>
<P>
 Make in-camera dupes. If you've got a great shot in the viewfinder, shoot more 
than one frame. This way, if the transparency or negative gets scratched, you 
still have a backup original. In-camera duplicates will always be better than 
dupes made later in the lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoot a lot. Study what works and what doesn't. Many people find it extremely 
useful to log their exposure information for each shot and note the results 
when the images come back from processing. Look at what other photographers do 
and learn from them. After learning what you can, ruthlessly edit your work to 
eliminate all but the best images. It's OK to throw away slides and prints; 
professionals throw away far more than they keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Experiment and have fun. Try lying on the ground for a different perspective, 
or shooting a flower from directly above looking down, or shooting white 
flowers by a full moon. And break the rules occasionally, including all of the 
above suggestions. Many creative, original images come from accidents that 
happen exploring new territory.

MATERIALS; MANUFACTURED PANELS OFFER A SOLID WAY TO SAVE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For some home-building projects, only solid wood will do. But, as often as 
not, manufactured wood panels look and work every bit as well as solid wood. 
And they can save you time and money, especially if you don't have a full-scale 
home workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufactured panels allow you to design and build cabinets and furniture that 
contain relatively large parts without the necessity of gluing together and 
surfacing many smaller pieces of solid wood. And panels often cost less than 
solid wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Various types of panels are available. Plywood panels are made by peeling or 
slicing a log into thin sheets called veneers, which are dried and then glued 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-veneered panels, such as flake board, wafer board, oriented-strand board 
and particleboard are all made by chipping or grinding wood into small pieces, 
drying the chips and mixing them with adhesive to form a thick mat. 
</P>
<P>
 The differences in the various panels are based on the size of the chips and 
the way they are oriented in the mat. 
</P>
<P>
 Particleboard is small, compressed particles, often in layers, but with no 
grain orientation. Oriented-strand board is made from strand-like particles 
arranged in layers with the grain in alternate layers at right angles to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Wafer board and flake board also consist of compressed particles, but they can 
be either randomly or directionally oriented. The basic difference between the 
two is the size and thickness of the particles, with flake board having larger 
and thinner flakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Plywood and other panels can span large areas like tabletops, doors or 
countertops in one piece. They also have greater dimensional stability than 
solid wood, especially across the grain of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Panels resist shrinking and swelling, can be face-nailed or screwed very close 
to the edge without splitting and make strong cabinet or case backs.  
</P>
<P>
 On the down side, panel products do not hold nails or screws well in their 
edges. And, because of their construction, the edges must be covered if you 
want the panels to look like solid wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Using panels can mean significant materials savings. Parts cut from 
random-width, random-length solid stock waste about 30% of Select or Better 
grades. Lower lumber grades seldom yield more than 50% usable footage. But 
because panels come in stock sizes, generally 4 feet by 8 feet, and have 
uniform thickness and quality, maximum yields can be 90% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 When buying panels, remember that hardwood veneers are relatively expensive. 
Structural panels are cheaper than hardwood-faced plywood, so use this material 
where you want the convenience of a panel but don't need its decorative 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Since thin one-fourth-inch hardwood-faced panels cost half as much as 
three-quarter-inch, consider bonding one to lower-grade half-inch material when 
the back won't show. Also, one-eighth-inch hardboard makes good drawer bottoms, 
dust panels and case backs and costs a lot less than hardwood-veneered plywood.

BAKKER ENTERS HALFWAY HOUSE AFTER SERVING 4 1/2 YEARS IN PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Bakker returned Friday to the state where his lucrative TV ministry began, 
arriving at a halfway house after 4 1/2 years in prison for defrauding 
investors out of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be back in the Carolinas and I'm glad to be with my son today," 
said Bakker, who built his religious empire, Heritage USA, near Charlotte. "I'm 
excited to be anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by his teen-age son, Jamie, and his attorney, the former PTL 
leader arrived at a Salvation Army halfway house shortly after 11 a.m. He had 
left a minimum-security prison in Jesup, Ga., about seven hours earlier and 
flew to this city in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where he must stay until Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker, 53, was convicted in 1989 of defrauding thousands of his followers who 
sent him at least $1,000 each in return for promised lodging at Heritage USA 
for three days and four nights every year for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 During his trial, prosecutors said the scheme brought about $158 million into 
PTL from far more people than Heritage USA could accommodate. Rather than 
building promised hotels for his followers, Bakker spent their contributions to 
live in luxury himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker chatted for a few minutes Friday with reporters before going inside the 
one-story brick halfway house. Bakker will live with about 15 other men at the 
center and be driven to a job in the area. Officials would not disclose further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms, would not comment on reports that Bakker's job 
would be at his law office in nearby Hendersonville. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of a better place in the world for Jim Bakker to be than the 
Salvation Army," Toms said after bringing his client a turkey club sandwich and 
a slice of Key lime pie for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Bakker will live in the Hendersonville area until his father is released 
from the halfway house, Toms said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker began his television ministry in Charlotte, and before it collapsed in 
1987 he was host of a popular television show and ran Heritage USA as a major 
Christian resort and religious retreat in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker's original 45-year sentence was reduced by an appellate judge, who said 
a federal judge made inappropriate remarks about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was in prison, Bakker was divorced by his wife of 30 years, Tammy 
Faye. She later was remarried to Roe Messner, who was the chief builder at 
Heritage USA.

SACRAMENTO FILE: ASSEMBLY OKS COMMISSION TO REGULATE CARD ROOM GAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Gillam, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the opposition of Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), the Assembly 
has approved a bill to establish a state commission to regulate card room 
gambling in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission would license card rooms and the attorney general would be 
given the power to conduct background checks on people who wish to enter the 
field as proprietors. 
</P>
<P>
 A 48-10 vote was cast on the bill (AB 2803), sponsored by Assemblyman Phillip 
Isenberg (D-Sacramento). The measure still has to be approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg said $7.5 billion was wagered in card rooms throughout the state last 
year, adding that such an amount of money could attract organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown argued that the legislation was unnecessary and would make Republican 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren "the gambling czar of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), a close Brown ally, temporarily 
prevented the measure from moving to the Senate by serving notice that he would 
seek reconsideration of the vote. 
</P>

 Leave it to an expert: Aspiring actor Dennis Woodruff had finished auditioning 
for a role as a police officer when girlfriend Tonya Nance grabbed a pair of 
his handcuffs and jokingly shackled herself to his car seat in a 7-Eleven 
parking lot in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned too late that the key to the bracelets was broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodruff flagged down a police car. The officers tried their handcuff keys, 
which didn't fit. Then they brought out a 4 1/2-foot-long pair of bolt cutters 
and snipped the chain between the cuffs. But they left in place the one cuff 
that was around her wrist out of fear that they might injure her. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time a small crowd had gathered in the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
 A passer-by offered to open the cuff if someone would get him a paper clip. A 
store clerk found him the piece of equipment, after which Steve Torrez needed 
15 minutes to free Nance. Afterward, Torrez told Times reporter Darin Esper 
that he had been released from San Quentin 2 1/2 months ago.

 Holding a torch for El Monte: With the Fourth of July weekend here, what could 
be more appropriate than a photo of the Southland's Statue of Liberty? The 
22-foot-high sculpture, made of fiberglass, was donated to the city of El Monte 
in 1987 by a local doctor who had received it as part of a deal with an 
overseas manufacturer. And Lady Liberty has stood in front of El Monte's City 
Hall ever since, gallantly beckoning toward motorists on the 605 Freeway.

football questions. Football is not an option." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Wednesday night after the Knicks took him 26th overall in the 
first round of the NBA draft, and as his agent, Eugene Parker, put it Thursday, 
"If Charlie said it, it's correct. What he meant was that he's not pursuing 
football, he's pursuing basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Football apparently is not pursuing him, either. Ward, the Heisman 
Trophy-winning quarterback from Florida State, was passed over in the NFL's 
seven-round draft in April, and no team moved to sign him as a free agent 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 His only legitimate football option is the Canadian Football League, whose 
season overlaps the NBA's only in late October and early November. But the Las 
Vegas Posse, which holds his rights, is unwilling to match the salary he will 
get from the Knicks as a first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is a moot point, said Ward, Parker and the Knicks, who all are 
convinced  
</P>
<P>
 of Ward's commitment. General Manager Ernie Grunfeld said he was convinced of 
that in interviews with Ward before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt like he wanted to deal with life as it came to him. He believed there 
was a reason for everything," Grunfeld said Thursday. "He felt that maybe 
football wasn't for him, and that maybe his destiny was in basketball. He felt 
he had better options in basketball, as far as longevity is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 His declarations to the Knicks and other NBA teams apparently were as 
convincing as the ones he made to NFL teams that spoke to him before their 
draft. Word got out that Ward would not sign with a team unless he was drafted 
in the first round. NFL people pegged him as a second-round pick, but the 
threat supposedly scared teams off. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's contention is that Ward simply made it clear that football wasn't his 
only option. "They wanted Charlie to make a commitment to football," he said. 
"Charlie said, 'You're not making a commitment to me, why should I make that 
commitment to you?' They were worried that they would not have control of the 
situation. All he said was that if they didn't (take him in the first round), 
he would consider his options, one of which is basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Grunfeld said Ward should only get better with time and extended exposure to 
the game. "You could really see steady improvement, from (pre-draft tournaments 
in) Phoenix to Chicago to the USBL," he said, naming a few of the ways Ward 
accelerated his progress. Grunfeld added, "He's got great basketball skills, 
and he has a natural ability to lead, to be a quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Preferably, the Knicks would love for Ward and their other first-round pick, 
forward Monty Williams, to play in the Doral Arrowwood Summer League in White 
Plains later this month; that, as well as most contractual situations, will 
certainly be held up by the ongoing collective bargaining negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward joins a logjam at point guard that includes starter Derek Harper, injured 
veteran Doc Rivers and third-year pro and former starter Greg Anthony. Most 
likely, the odd man out is Anthony, whose minutes decreased as the playoffs 
wore on. The Knicks are not actively pursuing a deal, but would listen to the 
right offer. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of listening to the right offer: "If the CFL called me, I 
wouldn't hang up. I'd be foolish not to listen," said Parker, who added Ward to 
a two-sport client list that includes Deion Sanders. "But we're not pursuing 
that."

in the worst division in baseball, but you are more than 10 games under .500.

 Picture the seventh game of the NBA finals decided by a Vernon Maxwell shot 
taken a full four minutes after time had run out in the overtime period. This 
is an analogy to the way injury time is kept in World Cup soccer games. Only 
one person, the referee, knows how much time is left at the end of each period.

 Win or lose, American soccer has graduated with distinction during World Cup 
'94. But what of our TV commentators. Al Trautwig easily topped the constant 
stream of gaffes by Roger Twibell, Randy Hahn and Jim Donovan, when, at sea as 
usual, he advised that referees' shirts could not be more than 45 years old. Ty 
Keough admitted bias by wanting Italy to beat Ireland, whom he castigated 
throughout their victory. Soccer's Golden Gall Award goes to Rick Davis, who 
criticized every kick of the Belgian and Dutch game, technically the finest so 
far. We deserve better.

 Why all the flap from the anti-soccer folks about a lack of scoring in the 
world's most popular sport? A major difference between soccer and football 
scoring is that in the latter, six points are awarded for crossing the goal 
line rather than one. And don't forget that boring, automatic conversion kick 
to make it seven. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's time we appease the point-crazed American sports fan. Let's make 
a soccer goal worth 20 points in America. That way a game that now ends with a 
dull 2-1 score would become an exciting 40-20. What about those dreary ties? 
Wouldn't we be a lot happier with a 40-all result? And a 100-0 wipeout would 
provide plenty of material for those now-converted sportswriters to endlessly 
extol the greatness of some powerful soccer machine.

WILSON, TOP LAWMAKERS AGREE ON BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State legislative leaders and Gov. Pete Wilson agreed Friday on the terms of a 
$57.3-billion budget and a related measure that could trigger automatic 
spending reductions if the state's fiscal condition worsens over the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Already late with the budget for the seventh time in eight years, lawmakers 
immediately began voting on pieces of the multi-bill budget package and planned 
to remain in session over the Independence Day weekend to complete action on 
the measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging agreement staves off the issuance of IOUs -- which was imminent 
-- and appeared to satisfy an international syndicate of banks that will vouch 
for the state's credit when it borrows $4 billion this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although final details of the budget deal still needed to be worked out late 
Friday, agreement on the outline of the accord was struck after a day of 
closed-door talks in Wilson's office, during which Democratic leaders conceded, 
one by one, most of the major points in contention. 
</P>
<P>
 The first sign of a breakthrough came late Thursday when the Democrats -- 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Senate President Pro Tem 
Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) -- said they had abandoned hope of raising more tax 
revenue with levies on the wealthy or on business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats had wanted to extend for at least two years a surcharge that 
upper-income taxpayers have been paying since 1991 but which is due to expire 
at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting Republican resistance, the Democrats then tried to narrow a business 
tax break that was meant for small companies but also can be claimed by large 
corporations if they have fewer than 35 owners. Wilson and his GOP allies also 
rejected this proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The only tax measure to which the Republicans would agree was a bill to 
postpone for two years the reinstatement of the renters tax credit, which has 
been suspended since last year. The credit, $60 for individuals and $120 for 
couples, goes mostly to low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many times can you run into a wall?" asked Lockyer, referring to the 
governor's steadfast opposition. "The wall wins." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats also agreed to higher spending for state prisons and restored 
several executive branch programs dear to Wilson that a legislative budget 
committee had deleted. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in a move that may have sealed the deal, Lockyer said the Democrats 
accepted Wilson's longtime desire to deny extra welfare benefits to women who 
have additional children after they are on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare rights advocates were irate that the Democratic leadership would 
accept this proposal, which has been rejected once by voters and repeatedly by 
legislative committees. The policy change also is opposed by abortion 
opponents, who believe it could encourage poor mothers to abort their 
pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only in a back-room deal that was not exposed to an open debate could this 
have been agreed upon," said Casey McKeever, an attorney for the Western Center 
on Law and Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare grants will also be cut 2.3% across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Not at issue in this week's talks was the level of funding for education, 
which had been settled. The budget will leave per-student funding at the 
kindergarten through 12th-grade levels at this year's sum of about $4,200. 
Higher education will get a small boost but students in the University of 
California and California State University systems will be hit with fee 
increases of 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Brown said it was going to be difficult to round up the votes needed 
to pass the budget with a two-thirds majority. Other than doing their duty in a 
"close to timely fashion," Brown said, there was little incentive for Democrats 
to vote for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough document," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockyer was more upbeat, telling reporters that the Democrats had managed 
to prevent even deeper cuts in the programs they support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We protected health and welfare and education," he said. "That feels like a 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno said the budget agreement was not 
"one we are going to be proud of," adding: "It's bad but it gets us by this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget covers only the next 12 months, but it is part of a two-year plan 
that requires the biggest borrowing in state history -- about $4 billion this 
month and another $3 billion over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jittery about the state's fiscal future, the banks that will help the state 
finance the debt demanded a historic standby measure that would prompt either 
spending cuts or tax increases if revenues come up short. The banks acted after 
Wall Street investors said Wilson's hope for a $2.8-billion federal bailout the 
year after next was not sufficient to ensure that the state could repay its 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 After Republicans refused to vote for any bill that included higher taxes, 
Democrats agreed to a version that calls only for spending cuts. The bill 
passed Friday on lopsided votes in both houses and Wilson was expected to sign 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 This standby legislation -- the so-called trigger bill -- is potentially one 
of the most far-reaching fiscal measures ever enacted in California. If state 
revenues come up short, as they have in each of the past four years, the bill 
will set off a chain of events that could produce unprecedented reductions in 
prisons, higher education, and health and welfare programs without another vote 
of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Legislature and the governor did what was asked of them," said state 
Controller Gray Davis. "It was by no means a pleasant task. But they did not 
flinch. Right now I'm sure there's a bad taste in people's mouths. But years 
from now people will look back at this moment with some pride." 
</P>
<P>
 The trigger bill calls for the controller to prepare an estimate of the 
state's cash flow and then, on Nov. 15, determine if revenues and expenditures 
are tracking with projections. If there is a shortfall of more than 1% -- about 
$430 million -- the governor will be required to present a plan to fix the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If the governor and the Legislature deadlock, the bill triggers automatic, 
across-the-board reductions in all programs not protected by the state 
Constitution and federal law. Exempted would be kindergarten through community 
college programs, debt service on outstanding bonds and some payments to local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The depth of the resulting cuts would depend on the severity of the cash 
shortage. A $1-billion shortfall would prompt cuts equivalent to 15% on an 
annual basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders said they do not believe the cuts will ever happen. The 
first year of the two-year budget plan, they said, is sufficiently stable, and 
any problem developing in the second year can be addressed when the next budget 
is debated a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans said they believe the trigger bill gives them assurances they 
have never had before that the budget will not veer too far out of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for us to make our books balance," said Assemblyman Dean Andal 
(R-Stockton). "I believe it's a big step forward."

ARAFAT RETURNS IN TRIUMPH TO GAZA, PLEADS FOR UNITY; MIDEAST: AFTER 27-YEAR

 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, triumphant in his "journey of return" after 27 
years of exile, called on Palestinians on Friday to put aside their differences 
and build "a democratic and free homeland." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, setting out the tasks of the new Palestinian Authority, pledged that 
the agreement the Palestine Liberation Organization signed with Israel on 
limited autonomy for the Gaza Strip and the Jericho district in the West Bank 
would be expanded to all of the West Bank and eventually would bring 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 On a day of drama and history, Arafat was sober, businesslike, almost in awe 
of the scale of the problems that he faces in turning this impoverished strip 
of land into the paradise that many of his people expect will come from 
self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 After crossing the border from Egypt in midafternoon, Arafat addressed a rally 
of about 70,000 in front of the building that will house the Palestinian 
Authority's legislature. He then plunged into a night of meetings with 
political leaders from the Gaza Strip and West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping the fiery rhetoric that marked his speeches as a guerrilla leader, 
Arafat bluntly warned his people: "We have a very hard task ahead -- to build 
our country, to reconstruct our institutions, to recover from the (Israeli) 
occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there was also reflection among Palestinians on the significance of 
Arafat's return -- the launch of the Palestinian Authority, the first step 
toward statehood, the symbolic return of the exiled Palestinian people. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my new day of birth," said Intisar Wazir, widely known as Umm Jihad, 
the social affairs minister in the Palestinian Authority. "This day reminds me 
of all the years of sadness and tragedy of the Palestinian people when it was 
outside its homeland. This day reminds me of my husband, Abu Jihad (the late 
Khalil Wazir), and all the others who fell in the Palestinian struggle. And I 
am wishing for the moment when true and full peace will reign between Israelis 
and Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaza Strip presents a formidable challenge to Arafat's ambitions, to 
Palestinian hopes for both prosperity and democracy and to peace in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 850,000 people, many of them refugees from old Arab villages in what 
is now Israel, are crammed in its 140 square miles. Living conditions here are 
squalid. Many people have not been employed for years and barely subsist. 
</P>
<P>
 This poverty and desperation bred the original Palestinian revolution, then 
the intifada , the 1987 uprising against Israeli occupation that ultimately led 
to the peace accord between Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, escorted to the Gaza border by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, 
walked across at Rafah at midafternoon, gesturing with a "V" for victory sign. 
He dropped to his knees to kiss the ground and to pray. He was quickly engulfed 
by scores of Palestinian police officers, disappearing for a while, his 
black-and-white headdress barely visible, before the officers raised him aloft 
to the cheers of jubilant supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 As Arafat's fast-moving motorcade reached Gaza City, which was decked in 
Palestinian flags and welcome banners, tens of thousands of people poured into 
the streets to cheer him. 
</P>
<P>
 As they assembled in front of the legislative council building, people joined 
in songs and folk dances and cheered the PLO leader wildly when he appeared. 
Crowds tore through security fences to get closer to the stage. People fired 
guns into the air in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaos in Gaza City brought renewed fears of an assassination attempt 
against Arafat, and Israel Army radio reported that a man with a gun hidden in 
a camera was arrested while trying to kill Arafat here. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether there was an assassination attempt on Arafat, Nabil Shaath, a 
top aide, replied with a laugh: "The only way to assassinate Arafat today was 
by over-kissing him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammed Dahlan, Palestinian head of preventive security in the Gaza Strip, 
said there had been no arrest, as did Maj. Gen. Nasser Yussuf, commander of the 
Palestinian police. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish settlers had sought to protest Arafat's visit to Gaza but found 
themselves barred by Israeli troops from entering the autonomous area of Gaza. 
Instead of demonstrations, they had to content themselves with signs denouncing 
him as a terrorist and demanding, "Death to the Murderer!" 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat's welcome here was clear as parents brought young children to see 
and hear the Palestinian leader -- a chance to be present at history. 
</P>
<P>
 "With spirit, with blood, we sacrifice for you, Abu Ammar," the crowd chanted, 
using Arafat's nom de guerre. 
</P>
<P>
 "My loved ones, my family, my clan, my tribe, my people, my brothers," Arafat 
began, his voice thick with emotion. "Here we are, and on this day we meet for 
the first time together on the soil of Palestine in struggling Gaza." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat acknowledged that the struggle continues, in fact, because Israel still 
holds as many as 6,000 Palestinian prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have refused to make concessions on any prisoner or inmate," he declared. 
"We reject bargaining. The issue of the prisoners is the most important issue 
for us. It will not be possible for us to rest without them being among us." 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO chairman reached out to Palestinian opposition groups, notably the 
Islamic fundamentalists, in an appeal for national unity; he warmly greeted Dr. 
Haidar Abdel-Shafi, one of Gaza's most distinguished leaders and one of 
Arafat's most persistent critics, and kissed him eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 And prompted by Wazir, Arafat saluted the young generation of Palestinians who 
led the six-year uprising against Israeli rule here and in the West Bank, 
paving the way for the negotiations on self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heartiest blessing to the children of the stones, to the heroes of the 
stones," Arafat said, acknowledging that the stone-throwers who challenged 
Israeli soldiers in the streets had in practice succeeded where his guerrilla 
army had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The second pledge Arafat made was to expand the area of Palestinian autonomy 
until it covers the rest of the West Bank, which is still occupied by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going from here, from Gaza to the al Ibrahimi mosque (in Hebron), 
going to Janin, to Nablus, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Bethlehem, Beit Sahur, Beit Jala 
and Ramallah, and then, then Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem," he said, 
promising to "liberate" the Arab section of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such comments normally arouse the ire of Israelis, who proclaim 
Jerusalem their "united and eternal capital," Foreign Minister Shimon Peres 
reacted calmly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can say anything he wants, but he must act according to what is in the 
agreement," Peres said. "We cannot act as the censors of his dreams. As long as 
he acts in accordance with the agreement, meaning that he negates and prevents 
terror, and departs from the Palestinian charter and accepts all the work rules 
in Gaza and Jericho, it is OK." 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Arafat told the Israelis, his partners in the search for a 
Middle East peace: "With Mr. (Yitzhak) Rabin, we signed the peace of the brave, 
and I say to them, the peace of the brave needs more bravery, more courage from 
everyone so that we can protect it and peace continues." 
</P>
<P>
 Peres observed in Jerusalem: "The test is in the doing, and as things have 
been done until now, things are going beautifully. . . . Until now it must be 
said that of all the Palestinian leaders, Arafat, as they say in English, 
delivered the goods." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat will also visit the West Bank self-rule enclave of Jericho during his 
current visit, Shaath told reporters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Arafat will go to Paris on Tuesday.

CLINTON BARELY AVERTS REBUKE ON BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, under continuing congressional criticism for its 
handling of foreign policy, narrowly averted a major rebuke in the Senate on 
Friday when it defeated legislation that would have required the lifting of the 
Yugoslav arms embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate split 50-50 over a Republican measure that would have directed 
President Clinton to ignore the United Nations and end U.S. participation in 
the almost 3-year-old embargo, which many have criticized, saying it has 
hamstrung the Muslim-led government from defending Bosnia-Herzegovina from 
Serbian nationalist aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the tie defeated the measure -- a majority was required for approval 
-- its near success underscored the persistent unease among lawmakers over 
Clinton's handling of Bosnia and other foreign policy trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
 A tie vote on an issue "of such importance is a 'no' vote-of-confidence," said 
Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee who voted to end the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message here," added Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.), who opposed the measure, "is that the Senate does not agree by a very 
large majority with the Bosnian arms embargo" and remains split only over "the 
consequences of lifting it unilaterally." 
</P>
<P>
 With Clinton personally working the phones to sway wavering senators and his 
Senate allies delaying the vote until one Democrat could rush back from his 
home state, the arms embargo dominated debate over a $263.3-billion defense 
bill that the Senate was struggling to complete before adjourning for its July 
4 recess. 
</P>
<P>
 In other votes, the Senate decided by a margin of 55-45 to retain the option 
of building more B-2 Stealth bombers and agreed by an overwhelming margin, 
88-12, to move up by six months the date on which military retirees receive 
cost-of-living increases in their pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the Bosnia issue that provided the drama as the Administration 
worked feverishly to avert a highly embarrassing foreign policy setback just 
days before Clinton embarks on an overseas trip for economic talks with 
European leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The House, by a decisive 244-178 margin, attached an almost identical Bosnia 
amendment to the version of the defense bill that it passed earlier this month. 
A similar move by the Senate could have sent the measure to the President's 
desk -- forcing him either to lift the embargo or cast the first veto of his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Vetoing the defense bill, several Democrats noted privately, would have been 
especially embarrassing for Clinton, given his record of avoiding military 
service in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 With the stakes so high, Clinton personally spoke with several Democrats who 
were leaning toward supporting the Bosnia amendment, sponsored by Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.). 
</P>
<P>
 Other senior officials, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
joined the effort, working the phones and offices of wavering Democrats as 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) maneuvered to postpone the 
vote to give them more time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, three Democrats who had been expected to vote with Dole -- Sens. 
Richard H. Bryan and Harry Reid of Nevada and Ben Nighthorse Campbell of 
Colorado -- switched sides. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 37 Republicans and 13 Democrats voted to lift the embargo, while 43 
Democrats and seven Republicans voted against it. California Democrat Barbara 
Boxer voted with Dole; Democrat Dianne Feinstein sided with the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really went to the brink this time and almost didn't make it," a 
Democratic aide involved in the behind-the-scenes machinations confided. "There 
is a lot of disaffection, among Democrats as well as Republicans, with 
Clinton's foreign policy and with Bosnia in particular, and a lot of them kept 
saying they wanted to vote with Dole to communicate that disaffection to the 
White House." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time that the Senate has been at this particular brink, 
however. Last May, it voted, 50-49, to pass a similar Dole amendment. But still 
deeply divided over what course to follow in Bosnia, the Senate mixed its 
message then by also voting, by an identical 50-49 margin, to urge Clinton to 
lift the embargo only in consultation with U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, that earlier, self-contradicting resolution -- which had no 
companion in the House -- went nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time the stakes were higher, both because the House had since passed 
its own legislation and because senators were expressing increasing frustration 
with the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Imposed in September, 1991, the embargo was adopted by the U.N. Security 
Council in a bid to contain the bitter fighting among Muslims, Serbs and Croats 
in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been widely criticized for preserving the advantage enjoyed at the 
outset of the conflict by the better-armed Serbs as they pressed their campaign 
of "ethnic cleansing," especially against Bosnia's beleaguered Muslim-dominated 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Administration agrees with that assessment, it has resisted growing 
congressional calls to lift the Balkans embargo without the consent of its 
European allies and Russia, saying such unilateral action might imperil other, 
key international efforts, such as the Iraqi sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 
eve of the Bosnia vote, said that lifting the embargo at this time would also 
have a devastating effect on the efforts now under way to find a peaceful 
solution to the Bosnian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva next week, Christopher and the foreign ministers of Russia and the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization are to complete a new plan for the partition 
of Bosnia and present it to the warring factions. The Senate debate showed that 
Bosnia's supporters in Congress remain highly skeptical of the still sketchy 
plan.

OWENS RIVER GORGE FLOWS BACK TO LIFE WITH TROUT; WATER WARS: RELEASE OF FISH 
MARKS SYMBOLIC END TO THE BITTER DISPUTES BETWEEN L.A. AND THE OWENS VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight decades ago, as William Mulholland watched the first torrents of Owens 
River water cascade down to Los Angeles, the famed aqueduct builder uttered 
these words: "There it is. Take it." On Friday, the fish took some of it back. 
</P>
<P>
 The rugged Owens River Gorge -- rendered bone-dry for 40 years -- sprang to 
life Friday morning with 10,000 tiny brown trout, a symbolic beginning of the 
end in the long, bitter saga of water disputes between Los Angeles and the 
distant Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The city recently agreed, albeit begrudgingly, to let some river water flow 
back through its natural gorge in a sort of belated restitution to the people 
of the Eastern Sierra. State and local officials celebrated Friday by freeing 
the fingerling trout, with the hope that eventually the spectacular canyon 10 
miles north of Bishop -- and 235 miles from Los Angeles -- will thrive with 
fish and wildlife once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the banks of the Owens River, two local schoolchildren stood under a 
giant old willow and dumped six buckets of slippery trout into the cool, 
rushing water. An audience of about 50 people involved in long negotiations 
over the project watched fish swim down the gorge -- once one of the West's 
best trout streams -- for the first time since 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 Reverberating off the canyon walls like a ghostly echo was the unspoken 
thought that Los Angeles wouldn't be the booming, sprawling metropolis it is 
today if it weren't for the draining of the Owens River. 
</P>
<P>
 "This goes a long ways toward healing the old wounds," said Mono County Dist. 
Atty. Stan Eller, who led three years of negotiations with the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power over re-watering the gorge, which lies just 
inside his county. "When I drove up here today, I got chills seeing how green 
everything is now, when it was dry for so long. This is the way it ought to 
look." 
</P>
<P>
 Just after the turn of the century, cunning -- some say ruthless -- land 
deals, fictionalized in the movie "Chinatown," turned Los Angeles into the 
landlord of almost the entire Owens Valley in Inyo County. With construction of 
the city's aqueduct to capture enormous amounts of mountain runoff, the Eastern 
Sierra's orchards and ranches gradually withered away. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1953, 10 miles of the river gorge below Crowley Lake -- once one of the 
West's premier trout streams -- was transformed into a dust bowl when Los 
Angeles captured the rushing water in a penstock, or huge pipeline, to generate 
hydroelectric power for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has sacrificed part of its water rights to the river only after a 
long and acrimonious fight and a series of defeats in court. The transformation 
of the L.A. Department of Water and Power from the put-your-dukes-up reign of 
engineer Mulholland into a friendlier landlord has come slowly and subtly in 
the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "A decade ago, there was a mind-set at our department that we need to 
preciously guard all of our water. We had fought Inyo County tooth and nail for 
years," said Jim Wickser, assistant general manager of the Department of Water 
and Power. "But societal values have changed, and our department shifted gears. 
It's been a very definite shift, and we're looking at partnerships now." 
</P>
<P>
 By no account, though, has the saga ended. The squabbling is expected to 
continue for years over how much water Los Angeles should permanently return to 
the gorge, the rest of the Owens River and farther up the city's aqueduct, to 
Mono Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not over," said Darryl Wong, an associate fishery biologist for the 
state Department of Fish and Game in Bishop. "There are 50 miles of the lower 
Owens River that are still dry." 
</P>
<P>
 The re-watering of Owens River Gorge began literally by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a freak break in the giant penstock spilled water into a stretch 
parched for nearly four decades, prompting Mono County and the state Department 
of Fish and Game to renew negotiations with Los Angeles over the city's water 
rights. On June 7, the DWP -- facing the likelihood of losing a court battle to 
Mono County -- signed a five-year interim agreement to re-water the gorge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their reputation was to litigate, litigate and litigate," Eller said, "so I 
expected to start this thing and my successor sometime in the 21st Century 
would have to end it. But they've got a little better attitude now toward their 
responsibilities in the Eastern Sierra." A 41-year-old law that requires dam 
operators to maintain fish downstream was the key ammunition used by Mono 
County and the California Department of Fish and Game to force the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles won't lose any water, but it will sacrifice up to 25% of the 
hydroelectric power harnessed in the gorge, at a replacement cost of $6 million 
a year. The city will make up its loss -- which amounts to a fraction of 1% of 
its total power use -- by increasing generation at its coal-burning plant in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP officials also will spend $12 million to modify its gorge power plants so 
that five times more water -- about 80 cubic feet per second -- can flow into 
the gorge by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now you're only seeing a small trickle," Wickser said. "But when we get 
up to the full amount, we'll be losing a good amount of power." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Los Angeles Aqueduct was built in 1913, few people thought about the 
consequences to the environment or the quality of life in the sprawling Eastern 
Sierra. President Theodore Roosevelt declared that the water would be hundreds, 
if not thousands, of times more valuable to Los Angeles than to the Owens 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have this opportunity now to bring back this great fishery. California 
deserves to have its streams in better shape," said Boyd Gibbons, director of 
the state Department of Fish and Game, which directed the planting of the 
trout. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic resonance of Friday's riverside ceremony was somewhat lost on the 
two children, ages 9 and 13, from Mammoth and Bishop as they freed the fish. 
Even their parents haven't been alive long enough to recall the gorge untamed. 
</P>
<P>
 But old-timers such as Bob Gracey remember the canyon as a prized fishery, 
reached only by hardy hikers, inhabited by 20-pound trout. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the premier trout stream in all of California," said Gracey, 
chairman of the Inyo County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-hidden natural resource, the Owens River Gorge was cut by volcanic lava 
thousands of years ago. Its 500-foot granite walls -- a rock climber's paradise 
-- remain untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gorge is an incredibly beautiful and different place," said Jim 
Edmondson, executive director of Cal Trout, a fishing and environmental group 
striving to restore California rivers. "It still has high peaks, broad vistas, 
rock formations, and, as hard as the Bill Mulhollands of Los Angeles tried, 
they couldn't dry it all up. They couldn't blow it all away. It will rebound 
and it will rebound incredibly fast." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Fish and Game's stocking of 30,000 tiny trout over the next 
week is largely a symbolic gesture because the effort to revive the gorge -- 
much less the rest of the Owens River -- will take years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone went fishing tomorrow, they would be largely disappointed," 
Edmondson said. "What they should do is rush out and get a calendar for 1998. 
Eventually we will see a trout fishery at least 80% good as what was there 
historically. Possibly better." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no recriminations at Friday's ceremony, just warm accolades and 
hopeful talk of future reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are starting to check their guns at the door, so to speak," said 
Daniel Paranick, chairman of the Mono County Board of Supervisors, who came 
from a family of four generations of Owens Valley ranchers, some of whom sold 
water rights to Los Angeles almost a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback of the gorge, Paranick said, shows that urban demands for water 
and preservation of natural resources can both be accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
 "To find that balance is becoming more difficult every day," he said. "This is 
a real step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The gorge event Friday foreshadows an even bigger project that would restore 
60 miles of the lower Owens River that have been largely dry for over 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wickser said the re-watering of the river, which will cost the city $10 
million and sacrifice a small amount of water, was done "in the interest of 
harmony in Inyo County and to make up for environmental impacts of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 An agreement between the DWP and Inyo County, signed by both parties several 
years ago, is now awaiting final court approval as the participants debate how 
much water to restore. 
</P>
<P>
 Local leaders hope that reviving the gorge might help restore the area's 
ailing economy, which is almost entirely dependent on recreation and tourism. 
Fish and Game officials said they hope the gorge will draw fishermen, hikers, 
campers, bird watchers and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that a century from now, Los Angeles will be called the hero of the 
Owens Valley, not the villain, because without the aqueduct, urban development 
would have permanently scarred its natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been said," Wong said, "that the only thing worse than the city of Los 
Angeles being here is if they weren't here."

PARALLEL MURDER CASES -- BUT ONE IS JUST GRIMLY ROUTINE; COURTS: A WOMAN IS 
DEAD, A SPOUSE IS CHARGED. BUT ELITE INVESTIGATORS, FAMED LAWYERS AND THE MEDIA 
ARE MISSING.

<P>
 In the obscurity of the Santa Monica Courthouse, far from the main attraction 
in Downtown Los Angeles, a man is being prosecuted for his wife's murder in a 
case that is as routine as the O.J. Simpson story is sensational. 
</P>
<P>
 Records indicate that he stalked her, that he struck her in front of their two 
children, that her calls for help did not stop his threats. A day after their 
divorce, he allegedly stabbed her to death, repeatedly thrusting a kitchen 
knife into her chest. Then he fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface of it . . . your mind is drawn to the O.J. Simpson case," 
Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Robert T. Altman said. So drawn, in fact, 
that Altman on Friday postponed the trial until after the hubbub surrounding 
the former NFL star subsides, even though lawyers had begun selecting a jury. 
"It's not a great time to be on trial for killing your wife," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the haunting similarities to America's most celebrated criminal 
drama, the case of James and Maria Foster has received the same prosaic 
treatment that characterizes most allegations of spousal murder -- at least 
when the suspect and victim enjoy neither wealth nor fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department's elite 
robbery-homicide division, the case was assigned to two Pacific Division 
detectives, whose notes eventually passed through the hands of nearly a dozen 
other investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being tried by two veteran attorneys with a string of high-profile 
convictions, the evidence is being presented by a lone deputy district attorney 
making her debut as lead prosecutor in a murder trial. Instead of being 
represented by a prestigious lawyer who charges hundreds of dollars an hour, 
the accused has a public defender who also has never taken a murder case to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 And instead of front-page headlines and round-the-clock TV coverage, the story 
has been all but ignored, earning just four paragraphs buried on Page A 36 of 
The Times after the body was found. Even LAPD detectives could not interest 
"America's Most Wanted" in profiling the case while the suspect was on the lam. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like the stuff that's going to get them ratings," said Detective Bill 
Cox, the most recent homicide investigator to handle the case. "This was just a 
run-of-the-mill murder. The people weren't known. There was no book to be 
sold." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Ann Foster's life was cut short in 1985, the year that Nicole Brown and 
O.J. Simpson were married. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the 29-year-old Western Airlines clerk had spent nearly eight years 
in a troubled relationship and had filed a petition for divorce, citing a 
history of physical and emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, she accused her husband, an IBM administrator, of stalking 
her at work. He also had hit her in the face in front of their two girls, then 
4 and 7 years old, and "repeatedly made threats to harm or kill me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She requested a restraining order, prohibiting her husband from coming within 
100 yards of her Torrance home, her office or her children's school. But she 
had little faith that it would protect her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can get a restraining order and he'll come over and kill me anyway," she 
told her mother, Virginia Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Simpson once allegedly smashed his wife's car with a baseball bat in 
1985, court records show that James Foster was accused of following his wife's 
car in September of that year and pounding it with his fist. 
</P>
<P>
 That November, another document shows, Foster came to his wife's front door 
and allegedly struck her and her mother. Torrance detectives took a report and 
a city prosecutor charged him with two misdemeanor counts of assault and 
battery. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was too late. Within two weeks, Maria Foster was dead, stabbed inside 
her car in a parking garage near her office at Los Angeles International 
Airport. Her husband, authorities contend, ambushed her as she headed to work 
that morning -- a contention supported by a witness's account of the brutal 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was yelling, 'Help me! Help me!' " a co-worker, Marilyn Clark, testified 
at a no-frills, one-day preliminary hearing. "She just kind of fell out onto 
the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 After Clark honked her horn, Foster's attacker stood up, a bloody knife in his 
hand. Then he ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike O.J. Simpson, who was seen by motorists on the Santa Ana Freeway after 
he failed to surrender to police, James Foster slipped out of town in 
anonymity. He ended up in Mississippi, according to authorities, who believe he 
worked there under an alias as an electrician. 
</P>
<P>
 After the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were 
discovered in Brentwood, officials wasted no time in bringing in a team of 
detectives from robbery-homicide, a highly experienced crew that is often 
assigned to prominent cases, such as the Night Stalker and Hillside Strangler 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Maria Foster's mother felt that police would have looked 
harder for her daughter's killer had she been a celebrity. "When (former 
Secretary of State) March Fong Eu was attacked in her house, they caught her 
assailant almost immediately," Fitzgerald said, noting that the same swift 
response followed a similar knife attack on City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more money you have," Fitzgerald added, "the better treatment you get." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, the LAPD detective, said his colleagues take all their assignments 
seriously. "We don't care who it is, we want the bad guy in jail," he said. But 
he acknowledged that "it helps when you have the resources they have on the 
Simpson case. Here, you just don't get that luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 James Foster, 49, was arrested last year by police in Jackson, Miss., after a 
domestic dispute with a girlfriend. He was booked on burglary charges. His 
fingerprints were scanned by an FBI computer, which showed a pending Los 
Angeles murder warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of an isolated cell in the County Jail's "high-power unit," he was 
placed among the general inmate population. It was impossible to verify the 
amount of correspondence he has received, but there is little chance it 
compares to the 3,500 letters that arrive for Simpson each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster's attorney, Deputy Public Defender James R. Bendat, is an experienced 
lawyer with more than 16 years representing the indigent. But his other murder 
cases have always been settled before getting to trial, which is how he would 
prefer to resolve this case -- with a plea to voluntary manslaughter. At any 
rate, Bendat does not have the resources to seek the advice of such noted legal 
talents as F. Lee Bailey or Alan M. Dershowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I wish we had more money and sure, I wish we had a defense team," 
Bendat said. "In many ways, it is an unfair situation for poor clients." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the district attorney's office has not put its big guns on 
the case, either. In Simpson's preliminary hearing, which is expected to last 
at least a week, evidence against the football Hall of Famer is being presented 
on live TV by one lawyer who took on savings and loan executive Charles H. 
Keating Jr., and another who prosecuted the stalker convicted of slaying 
actress Rebecca Schaeffer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Foster's case, virtually no one has come to watch Deputy Dist. Atty. Loni 
Petersen, and no legal experts have analyzed her five-year career. She once 
assisted a veteran prosecutor in a spousal murder case that ended in a hung 
jury, but this is her first solo effort with such high stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen, who is seeking a first-degree murder conviction, was ready to make 
her opening statement Friday. But the judge, after querying prospective jurors 
about the Simpson case, seemed uncomfortable about proceeding with such a cloud 
of publicity overshadowing their trial. "There's no getting away from the 
parallels," Altman said in court, adding: "It's absolutely imperative not to 
confuse these two cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Foster's attorney agreed and asked for a postponement until Sept. 
12. For Maria Foster's mother, who is eager for a resolution to nearly a decade 
of grief, the delay is another reminder of who counts for what.  
</P>
<P>
 "Here's another celebrity," she said, "who could interfere with our right to 
get justice."

PROSECUTORS ZERO IN ON TIME OF KILLINGS; SIMPSON HEARING: TESTIMONY CENTERS ON 
EVENTS LEADING TO DISCOVERY OF THE BODIES. ALSO, A MYSTERIOUS ENVELOPE OF 
POSSIBLE EVIDENCE IS TURNED OVER TO THE COURT.

 Witnesses took the stand in the O.J. Simpson murder case Friday to testify in 
richly textured detail about the wanderings and barking of a dog whose 
movements may offer clues to the exact time that Simpson's ex-wife and a friend 
of hers were knifed to death in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's hearing was marked by mystery and surprise: The judge revealed that 
Simpson's lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, had met behind closed doors with a 
specially appointed jurist to turn over possible evidence in the case. The 
bulky Manila envelope was displayed in court, but Shapiro objected to it being 
opened, so it remained tantalizingly within reach but inaccessible even to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, prosecutors continued to build their case that Simpson should be 
forced to stand trial for the double homicide, and for the first time Friday, 
they displayed photographs of Nicole Brown Simpson's bloody corpse. Her body, 
along with that of Ronald Lyle Goldman, was discovered outside her condominium 
just after 12 a.m. June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 As the photographs were displayed, Simpson's chest heaved and his mouth 
dropped. Shapiro handed him a cup of water, and Simpson gulped it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Before displaying the photographs, lead prosecutor Marcia Clark leaned over 
the bar separating the public from the lawyers and investigators in the case 
and warned members of Nicole Simpson's family to shield their eyes. They did, 
her mother and one sister gripping hands tightly as the photographs were 
displayed and then quickly put away again. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the developments Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * As prosecutors attempted to show that the murders were committed before 11 
p.m. June 12, a key time in Simpson's alibi, one witness described hearing a 
dog's bark in the Brentwood neighborhood about 10:15 p.m., a "plaintive wail" 
that he noticed but did not investigate. Another neighbor told of coming upon a 
dog near Nicole Simpson's home and finding it agitated and with bloodstained 
paws. That encounter, the witness said, occurred shortly before 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * While testimony filled in gaps in the transfixing whodunit, Shapiro's 
carefully secreted package of evidence, which he delivered to a judge early 
Friday, added new spice to the saga. The package remains sealed in a bulky 
envelope, fueling speculation that a long-sought knife may have turned up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shapiro also gave prosecutors audiotapes of interviews with two potentially 
significant witnesses in the case: the limousine driver who took Simpson to the 
airport soon after the double homicide in Brentwood and Brian (Kato) Kaelin, an 
actor and writer who was staying in the guest house of Simpson's estate. 
Shapiro did not say why he gave his adversaries those interviews. After 
receiving them but not getting a chance to listen to them, Clark said she could 
not "in good conscience" call her next witnesses until she had the chance to 
review the tapes. Clark also questioned why she was only receiving the tapes 
Friday, when at least one of the interviews was conducted June 14, one day 
after the bodies were discovered. Simpson was not arrested until June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * Municipal Judge Ray L. Hart ordered that a court-appointed psychiatrist's 
report and copies of photographs of Nicole Simpson taken in connection with 
O.J. Simpson's 1989 arrest for spousal abuse should remain sealed at least 
until the hearing ends. NBC News had petitioned for the documents, but the 
defense, the prosecution and lawyers for the city had objected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police continued their hunt for the missing murder weapon, mapping out storm 
drains across Brentwood and laboriously combing through the ritzy neighborhoods 
where Nicole Simpson and her ex-husband lived just two miles apart. The search 
and other issues in the case have consumed much of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's robbery-homicide division, but officers show no signs of cutting 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The fervid investigation goes on even as lawyers are in court arguing about 
whether Simpson should be bound over for trial in the double murder, a charge 
that could send him to the gas chamber if he is convicted. The simultaneous 
efforts of detectives, private investigators, prosecutors and defense attorneys 
have lent an additional Hollywood quality to the proceedings, with packages of 
evidence arriving in court even as witnesses are on the stand, slowly retelling 
the events of the fatal evening. Attacking the Alibi 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the court action featured a procession of witnesses who filled in 
details of the final night in the lives of Nicole Simpson and Goldman. Their 
testimony was intended to establish certain times in order to narrow the window 
of time in which the killings could have taken place -- a key element either in 
bolstering or debunking the superstar athlete's alibi during the time that the 
murders took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers have said the football great was at home at 11 p.m. waiting 
for an airport limousine. They have cited a coroner's report suggesting that 
Nicole Simpson was still alive about that time, maintaining that it shows 
Simpson could not have committed the crime. But other witnesses in the case 
have suggested that the killings could have taken place somewhat earlier and 
that Nicole Simpson was last heard from closer to 10 p.m. than 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's colleagues from the Brentwood restaurant Mezzaluna said he left 
there about 9:50 p.m. carrying a white envelope with a pair of eyeglasses that 
Nicole Simpson's mother had lost outside the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Crawford, a manager at Mezzaluna, said she put the glasses in the white 
envelope, wrote "Nicole Simpson, prescription glasses" on the outside, sealed 
it and later gave it to Goldman. That envelope -- unopened, the glasses still 
inside -- turned up at the murder scene, and Clark displayed a photograph of it 
Friday sitting in a pool of dried blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers questioned Crawford only briefly, but they carefully picked 
apart statements by other witnesses, calling attention to inconsistencies 
between their testimony and what police officers recorded in their reports of 
interviews with the same people. 
</P>
<P>
 When Simpson attorney Gerald Uelmen asked bartender Stewart Tanner about 
confusion over some details in his account, Tanner conceded that he could not 
remember precisely what he had told police during an interview the day he and 
others learned of the killings. But Tanner, under questioning from Clark, 
defended his memory lapse as minor and understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two people that you knew are dead," he said. "What do you remember from that? 
You just remember that they are dead that day." A Dog Wailing in the Night 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant employees established the last known sightings of Goldman, a 
colleague they had known for four months before he was killed by a 
knife-wielding assailant. Although their accounts make clear that the killings 
could not have taken place before about 10 p.m., both sides are more interested 
in nailing down the latest possible time of death because that will establish 
whether Simpson could have had time to carry out the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, prosecutors called several of Nicole Simpson's neighbors, whose 
testimony turned largely on the howlings and wanderings of a dog -- an Akita 
owned by Nicole Simpson that curiously bears the same name as a witness in the 
case, Kato. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness described the "plaintive wail" of the dog near Nicole Simpson's 
home about 10:15 p.m., shortly after he had tuned in the 10 o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen to 20 minutes into it, I heard a dog barking," said neighbor Pablo 
Fenjves, describing it as "persistent barking that wouldn't stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Fenjves was followed to the stand by the day's most compelling witness, a 
neighbor of Nicole Simpson who delivered a detailed, almost minute-by-minute 
account of an evening walk through the community with his dog and of his 
encounter with the bloody, agitated white Akita in the street near her 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
 That witness, Steven Schwab, said he discovered the dog just before 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I approached the corner of Dorothy and Bundy, I saw that there was a dog 
at the corner," he said. "It was a large Akita, very white. As I approached 
further, I saw that it wasn't with anyone. There was no one walking the dog. 
The dog was just there. It was unusual for a dog to just be wandering the 
neighborhood by itself, and the dog seemed agitated. It was barking at the 
house on the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 That property was where Nicole Simpson lived and where the murders occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwab said he looked at the white dog and noticed it had blood on all four 
paws. He estimated the time at 10:55 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwab said he could remember that and other key times because he had been 
watching the "Dick Van Dyke Show" on TV before leaving on a half-hour walk. 
That show ended at 10:30 p.m., and Schwab said he then headed out for his 
evening walk, returning in time to catch the opening minutes of the "Mary Tyler 
Moore Show" at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watch a lot of TV," Schwab said at one point, smiling gently and explaining 
his meticulous memories of various times. 
</P>
<P>
 As with other witnesses, Schwab's recollections of precise times were 
challenged by Simpson attorneys, in particular because of a police report 
showing that Schwab told detectives initially that he believed he might have 
come upon the dog after 11 p.m. But Schwab insisted that his recollection in 
court was more precise, partly because he was initially interviewed by 
detectives at 5 a.m. and was rattled when they told him the dog might figure in 
a double homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 5 a.m. in the morning, and I was very confused at that point as to 
what time all of this occurred," he said. "I was trying to remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor who is monitoring the hearing, said 
Schwab's ability to link the times to television programs strongly bolsters his 
testimony, making him far more credible than a witness who merely checked his 
watch periodically. Combined with other testimony on the barking dog, Arenella 
said he believed prosecutors did "an effective job at setting the time of the 
murders closer to 10 p.m. than 11." 
</P>
<P>
 After Schwab returned home with the dog, his neighbors took care of it, he 
said, thinking that they would let it sleep inside and then take it to animal 
control authorities in the morning. But the dog, according to witness Sukru 
Boztepe, remained unsettled, sniffing and scratching at doors until he and his 
wife got up to take it for a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Straining at his leash, the dog then pulled them back to Nicole Simpson's 
residence, Boztepe testified. There, he and his wife became the first to spot 
the body of Nicole Simpson, curled at the foot of her condominium's front gate, 
her throat slashed and her body splattered with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a woman laying down horizontally all the way to the path, face turned 
to me on the right side," he said. "There was a lot of blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Boztepe and his wife, Bettina Rasmussen, each identified the photographs of 
the slain woman. Her eyes grew wide and she swallowed hard when it was 
presented to her, but she said she could not describe the scene in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it for a half-second," she said. "And I never looked back again." 
</P>
<P>
 According to an O.J. Simpson friend, the dog, which could be seen in the 
driveway of the athlete-turned-broadcaster's home just before he surrendered, 
is now living with Simpson's son, Jason. Battle of the Lawyers 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's testimony brought to 10 the number of witnesses who have taken the 
stand as prosecutors attempt to establish that there is enough evidence for 
Simpson to stand trial in the double murder. Prosecutors and defense attorneys 
have sparred at every turn -- on Friday, Shapiro unsuccessfully sought to 
exclude a witness's testimony because of comments by Clark reported in The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 And when court reconvenes Tuesday after the Fourth of July holiday, the sparks 
are expected to continue flying as several pressing issues are before the judge 
that could dramatically shape the progress of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have sought to suppress evidence seized from Simpson's home 
during a search hours after the murders. If successful, that motion would force 
prosecutors to proceed without such items as a bloody glove that matches one 
found at the crime scene, and bloodstains recovered from Simpson's car, 
driveway, bedroom and bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that issue is resolved, prosecutors expect to put the limousine driver 
and Kaelin on the stand. Neither has been heard from in court, and they could 
hold important clues to nailing down Simpson's comings and goings on the night 
of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating their possible testimony are the tapes that Shapiro turned over 
to prosecutors Friday. That move raised several provocative questions: Why were 
investigators working for Simpson conducting tape-recorded interviews with 
witnesses even before he was arrested? And why did Shapiro turn them over to 
prosecutors when he was not apparently under any obligation to do so? 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro did not supply the answers to those questions Friday, but may when 
court reconvenes at 9 a.m. Tuesday. The hearing is expected to continue all 
week.

FREE-SPENDING TABLOID MEDIA CAUSING JUDICIAL CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dramatic nature of the O.J. Simpson murder case has intersected with the 
growth of tabloid media to produce a landmark moment in checkbook journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "More money will be spent than ever before in the history of the press" on 
exclusive interviews with key figures in the case, said Stephen W. Coz, senior 
editor of the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Simpson's friend Al Cowlings has been offered "up to $1 million for 
his story," but declined that offer and others, according to his attorney, 
Donald M. Re. 
</P>
<P>
 Most mainstream news organizations do not pay for information, although 
supermarket scandal sheets and sensational TV programs regularly do. And this 
week, as one of the most closely watched preliminary hearings in history got 
under way, the role of the tabloids moved into the foreground and generated 
concern that they are interfering with the judicial process. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two witnesses at the hearing -- who said Simpson had purchased a 
15-inch knife -- revealed in court that the Enquirer was paying them $12,500 
for their exclusive story. That courtroom bombshell touched off a battle 
between the defense and the prosecution over witness credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole spectacle prompted lawyers and others to moan that the tabloid press 
is contaminating the legal system. And law professors noted that nothing short 
of trampling on the 1st Amendment can be done about witnesses or potential 
witnesses talking for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a real burgeoning problem," said Los Angeles attorney Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr., who has had firsthand experience with tabloids while representing 
singer Michael Jackson, who had been accused of molesting a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran said two witnesses sold stories to tabloid TV shows that contradicted 
and were more sensational than what they said in sworn depositions in a civil 
suit against Jackson. Ultimately, the case settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran's adversary in that case, Santa Monica attorney Larry R. Feldman, 
sided with him on the issue. "I think that the tabloid media seriously 
interfere with the judicial process," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jackson civil case, Feldman said he was shocked to learn that one of 
his potentially key witnesses had been paid $15,000 for an exclusive interview 
with "Hard Copy." Feldman said he was concerned that the witness's actions 
would have eroded her credibility if she had been called to the witness stand 
during a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what happened to Anne W. Mercer during the 1991 West Palm 
Beach, Fla., trial in which William Kennedy Smith was acquitted of rape 
charges. Smith's attorney, Roy E. Black, accused Mercer of changing her 
testimony to corroborate the story of a friend who was the alleged rape victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Black said Mercer invented testimony to embarrass Smith's uncle, Sen. Edward 
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), so she could sell her story to the television show "A 
Current Affair" for $40,000. "Isn't it a fact this whole program was created 
just to embarrass the Kennedy family?" Black asked rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
 He also attacked Mercer's account with a series of questions. For example, why 
did she first tell police the alleged victim had said Kennedy watched the 
purported rape, but then drop that assertion? 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about a similar cross-examination was apparently among the reasons why 
the Los Angeles district attorney's office decided to drop Jill Shively as a 
witness in the Simpson case after she was interviewed on "Hard Copy." Her grand 
jury testimony has not been made public, but she told "Hard Copy" that she had 
seen Simpson driving near the murder scene about the time the crimes occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutors did not learn about Shively's $5,000 deal until after she had 
testified before the grand jury, according to attorney James M. Epstein. He 
said that Shively asked him to represent her when she became concerned that she 
might be charged with a crime by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were unhappy that she had gone on 'Hard Copy' because they believed she 
had destroyed herself as a witness for them," Epstein said. "Once I confirmed 
she wasn't going to be charged with a crime, that was the end of my 
representation," Epstein said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a prosecutor, it must be a terribly frustrating feeling (to lose a 
witness this way) because the prosecutor has nothing to offer to persuade a 
witness not to sell his story or her story to a tabloid or a movie producer or 
whoever's buying," said Jonathan Kirsch, a Century City attorney who 
specializes in media law. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to appeal to their higher nature and their sense of duty," which may 
take a back seat when large sums are offered, Kirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Simpson case, the money is certainly flying. In addition to 
Cowlings, who accompanied the football legend on the notorious, televised 
low-speed chase, cash for interviews also has been offered to friends of 
Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole. Simpson is accused of killing her and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 As the preliminary hearing got under way Thursday, the first witnesses made 
two stunning statements: that Simpson had purchased a 15-inch knife at their 
Downtown cutlery store, and that they had sold their account to the Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing potential credibility problems for these government witnesses, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. William Hodgman nimbly elicited testimony about the paid interviews 
from the witnesses -- store co-owner Allen Wattenberg and sales clerk Jose 
Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Simpson's defense lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, immediately 
attempted to erode Camacho's credibility by accusing him of selling his story 
to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho retorted that he had told the truth to the Enquirer and to the grand 
jury, which had been taking testimony in the case before it was disbanded out 
of fears it was affected by prejudicial publicity. He also defended himself by 
saying an employee of the district attorney's office told him he could talk. 
</P>
<P>
 After court, prosecutors Hodgman and Marcia Clark were put in the awkward 
position of trying to simultaneously shore up Camacho's truthfulness about 
selling Simpson a knife, while emphatically denying that Camacho had been told 
he could talk to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said she thought that the paid interview would not have a serious impact 
on the case. And Coz, the Enquirer editor, emphatically maintained that his 
publication had done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not ask Mr. Camacho or the owners of the store to reveal anything 
about the grand jury process whatsoever," Coz said. "Let me state our policy: 
We pay for truthful information. We don't make any bones about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Coz added: "I think Marcia Clark made a very good point when she said: 'These 
people were telling the truth; they're being asked to tell what happened. 
That's no more nor less than what they're being asked to do in court for free.' 
When I heard her say that, I literally applauded her." 
</P>
<P>
 Theo Wilson, who during a lengthy career at the New York Daily News covered 
many high-profile murder cases, said she was disgusted by the upsurge in 
checkbook journalism demonstrated during the Simpson case and other recent 
celebrity trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any (immediate) harm was done with Camacho, but great harm 
could be done. You could create a mistrial," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do we trust a witness if money becomes a factor in who they're going to 
talk to? If those tabloids don't start to regulate themselves, I fear for what 
could happen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Dunleavy, senior correspondent of "A Current Affair," which has done 
at least 20 segments on the Simpson case, the brouhaha is much ado about 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the difference between a news organization paying for a witness 
and a lawyer paying for a witness," Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have plenty of rent-a-shrinks. I've seen them all my life," Dunleavy 
said, referring to psychiatrists who testify for pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Others agreed that there is a long tradition of lawyers using paid experts in 
trials and in other instances giving criminals more lenient sentences in 
exchange for offering testimony against their confederates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prosecutors use the testimony of paid informants and people who are paid with 
mercy from the system," said UCLA law professor John S. Wylie Jr., a former 
federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunleavy declined to state whether his show has paid anyone for their accounts 
in the Simpson saga. "As a policy, we do not reveal our sources or how we 
gather news, just like the New York Times, the L.A. Times, ABC, NBC." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ben Bagdikian, a former high-ranking editor at the Washington Post 
and ex-dean of the UC Berkeley School of Journalism, sharply disagreed: "If the 
practice of paying for interviews became widespread, the whole process of 
reporting would be distorted." 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term effect on the legal system is unclear, according to USC law 
professor Erwin Chemerinsky. "There is the danger that people, for the sake of 
money, might lie, exaggerate or unconsciously embellish." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in some instances jurors would look askance at the testimony of 
witnesses who had been paid for interviews, but that in other instances they 
would be accorded credibility if their testimony is consistent with what they 
told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA criminal law professor Peter Arenella was alarmed by what he has seen so 
far in the Simpson case. "What Thursday's hearing reminded us is how much 
tabloid journalism's interference with appropriate criminal investigations by 
the state can impair the district attorney's ability to put on truthful 
testimony." 
</P>
<P>
 Law professors and attorneys said there is no way to prevent witnesses from 
talking for cash without violating fundamental free speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can be done? Nothing, if we want to keep the 1st Amendment," said New 
York University law professor Stephen Gillers, who specializes in legal ethics. 
"The publication has a right to offer money in exchange for a story. And the 
witness has a right to sell the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors, who in some cases have also been talking for money after they served 
in celebrated cases, have become a concern as well. Unlike that of witnesses, 
jurors' conduct can be regulated in some ways. For example, the state of New 
York in 1990, in the aftermath of the Bernhard H. Goetz subway slayings case, 
made it a misdemeanor for sitting jurors to make a deal to sell their story to 
the media.

COLUMN ONE; THE POTENT POLITICS OF VITAMINS; THE INDUSTRY HAS LAUNCHED A 
CONTROVERSIAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST FDA REGULATION. IT'S HAD SURPRISING IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Handcock is a faithful patron of Mrs. Gooch's natural food emporium in 
Redondo Beach, a true believer in the restorative powers of fish oil -- and a 
foot soldier in the "vitamin wars" of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 The 82-year-old Torrance resident is a willing recruit in the army of 
consumers who have gone to bat for the $4-billion-a-year dietary supplement 
industry in its battle with the federal government over regulation of 
everything from beta carotene to shark cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to fight for our freedom," declared Handcock, who swears by the daily 
regimen he began after a heart attack 42 years ago: fish oils to keep his 
arteries unclogged, borage oil to aid his digestion and a smorgasbord of 
vitamins A, B, D, E and F, as well as calcium and magnesium, to keep him fit 
and vigorous. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired engineer is convinced that federal regulators are waging an 
assault on his well-being. He has sent numerous letters to members of Congress, 
urging them to protect his right to buy any product he likes. Legions of 
Americans like him have made the supplement uprising a movement that some 
compare to gun control or abortion in its emotional intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, Capitol Hill has been flooded by correspondence urging 
Congress to keep the government's hands off vitamins and related health 
products. The grass-roots campaign has been stoked by supplement manufacturers 
and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort has reached millions of supplement users through a nationwide 
network of mail-order flyers, fax bulletins, TV spots, form letters, petitions, 
videos, books and other materials distributed through "legislative action 
tables" at health food stores. The target is the Food and Drug Administration, 
which is implementing a law restricting health claims for supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 There is potent evidence the industry is gaining ground. Not necessarily the 
high ground, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics decry the campaign as downright deceptive. Even some mainstream 
members of the vitamin industry regard some of the rhetoric as overblown and 
the tactics excessive. Movement activists have tried to jam FDA phone lines, 
and have compared the agency to the Gestapo. In any case, the supplement 
showdown demonstrates the increasing sophistication of lobbying campaigns 
undertaken by special interests who use marketing savvy, public relations 
skills and technological expertise to create a temporary frenzy on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue also focuses attention on a small but lucrative industry that 
occupies a unique niche within the giant health care sector: the purveyors of 
nutrients and nostrums that the FDA says are generally benign but in some cases 
potentially dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA and its congressional allies say they do not intend to restrict access 
to supplements that are safe and that do not make false or misleading 
assertions about health benefits. For instance, a supplement cannot be touted 
as curing cancer or AIDS, or halting the aging process, unless there is 
substantial scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FDA said last year it was considering regulating some amino acids and 
herbs as drugs or as food additives, which would invoke tougher safety 
standards. The agency also cited a need to develop new guidelines for vitamins 
and minerals that "are safe when consumed at low levels but may have adverse 
effects when consumed daily at higher levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk fueled an already-high level of distrust in the industry and 
consumers. Vocal activists -- some of whom make the kind of exotic products 
that could face problems from increased regulation -- suggested the FDA's 
pronouncements proved the government planned to restrict access to all 
supplements, if not to ban them outright. 
</P>
<P>
 "Write to Congress today or kiss your supplements goodby!" warned a brochure 
widely distributed to consumers through a network of health food stores and 
mail-order houses by the Nutritional Health Alliance, a coalition of industry 
groups. In a television ad, a SWAT team crashes into actor Mel Gibson's house 
and seizes his vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin makers and merchants have told millions of customers that the FDA 
wants to either require a doctor's prescription to obtain their products, drive 
up prices, or pull them off the shelves altogether. It is a potent appeal, 
because some consumers view access to supplements as nothing less than a matter 
of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, activists have used the issue not only to fight additional safety 
regulations, but to try to weaken a 1990 nutrition-labeling law requiring 
supplement makers to support health claims with "significant scientific 
agreement among qualified experts" -- just as most food manufacturers must do. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever its veracity, the high-powered campaign is having considerable 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) received 35,000 letters on supplements last year 
-- nearly as many as on the economy and twice as many as on education. Boxer is 
one of 65 senators co-sponsoring an industry-backed measure introduced by Sen. 
Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) that would place the burden of proof on the FDA to show 
a product is unsafe, rather than making the manufacturer prove its safety. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would preempt the FDA's authority to treat any supplement as a drug or 
food additive and make it far easier for manufacturers to support health claims 
than it is under regulations that took effect Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent showdown over the Hatch bill and alternative legislation by Senate 
Labor and Human Resources Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that 
would be tougher on the industry, Kennedy was twice soundly defeated by 
pro-supplement lawmakers. It was the first time in memory that Kennedy had lost 
a vote before his own panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high. At issue is the way the safety of vitamins, amino acids, 
herbs and other widely used products will be determined and the standards used 
to screen health claims for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 100 million Americans take supplements to bolster diets, enhance 
well-being or combat illness. Many consumers -- who range from anti-government 
libertarians to health-conscious yuppies to New Age adherents -- bring a 
certain zealotry to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 15 years in this town, I've never dealt with anything as emotional as this 
issue," said Donna V. Porter, a life science specialist for the Congressional 
Research Service. "It's as volatile as abortion, gun control and prayer in 
schools. People are irrational on this whole subject. They don't hear what they 
don't want to hear. They really believe FDA is out to get them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitched battles over dietary supplements are not new. The FDA has long 
maintained that Americans can meet their nutritional needs by eating a 
well-balanced diet. In 1976, faced with consumer backlash, Congress passed 
legislation limiting the agency's authority to regulate the composition of 
supplements. The FDA then backed off further regulatory efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The climate began to change in 1989 when 1,500 cases of a painful muscle and 
blood disorder, including 38 deaths, were associated with L-tryptophan, an 
amino acid used by some to treat insomnia, depression and premenstrual 
syndrome. The product was taken off the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA says that, while most of the ingredients in supplements "present few 
safety concerns," there is evidence that a small number can cause liver and 
kidney damage, seizures, and even death. Manufacturers deny that their products 
pose such dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Congress passed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, which 
established requirements for allowing nutrient and health claims for foods, and 
authorized the FDA to determine whether it should create a separate system for 
approving claims for dietary supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 "When consumers see a health claim for a dietary supplement, they assume it 
will provide the benefit it touts," FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler said. "In 
fact, the marketplace is awash in unsubstantiated claims," some of which are 
fraudulent and harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress instructed the FDA to consider four specific health claims for 
supplements. The agency initially approved a claim that calcium helps prevent 
osteoporosis. It subsequently approved a second claim that folic acid taken by 
pregnant women lowers the risk of severe neurological birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
 The second key step occurred in 1991 when Kessler, seeking a more 
comprehensive approach, named an internal task force to examine alternatives 
for regulating supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, he said the task force had concluded "safety should be the 
overriding concern" in any FDA regulation and that "its recommendations should 
recognize a role for dietary supplements in ensuring a balanced diet and, with 
safety as an underlying principle, freedom of choice for these products should 
be allowed as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-1993, the FDA took a step that unwittingly gave supplement advocates 
new ammunition. At the same time it published regulations to implement the 
labeling law, it announced plans to propose regulations on broader safety 
issues and requested industry input. 
</P>
<P>
 That signal became the basis of the industry's claims that the FDA intended to 
treat amino-acid and herbal products as drugs or food additives and to sharply 
limit the dosage of vitamins. One advocacy group said the FDA aspired to 
"over-regulate, restrict and eliminate the dietary supplement industry." 
</P>
<P>
 FDA officials insist that the intent and significance of the notice were 
grossly overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agency has absolutely no plans to pursue any of the regulatory options 
laid out" last year, said Mitch Zeller, a special assistant for FDA policy. "We 
need a lot more data to even begin to make an informed inquiry into what our 
regulatory options are." 
</P>
<P>
 But a Democratic congressional aide sympathetic to the FDA's position faulted 
agency officials for failing to anticipate the reaction of supplement makers 
and users. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was like putting red meat in front of a wild cat," the aide said. "They 
never understood the politics of the movement because their mind-set has been: 
'This is how science operates.' But science doesn't operate in a vacuum. 
Particularly in this country, in terms of scientific regulation, it operates in 
a political environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by the industry, Hatch and Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.) introduced 
bills to address the issues of claims and safety. Each lawmaker represents a 
region with high concentrations of supplement suppliers and consumers. About 
250 House members have signed on. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures reflect the industry's desire to adopt a standard for health 
claims that would recognize all available scientific evidence, rather than 
significant scientific agreement among experts as required by the 1990 act. 
Critics say this approach would allow claims to be made based on studies that 
are preliminary, applicable only to animals or unconfirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a network of 10,000 health food stores nationwide as well as mail-order 
houses, advocates sent flyers urging consumers to oppose implementation of the 
labeling law and to back the Hatch-Richardson bill to "protect consumers' 
access to dietary supplements." 
</P>
<P>
 Displays were set up at health food stores with copies of letters to be sent 
to members of Congress. Some stores offered discounts to participants. Others 
provided free phone lines to call lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 During a nationwide "blackout day," many stores refused to sell products that 
were allegedly threatened. To underscore the notion that supplements could face 
extinction, sponsors made the brontosaurus the event's symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobbying effort hit a nerve with legions of consumers who regard the FDA 
as an agent of a medical, pharmaceutical and political Establishment that 
opposes alternative approaches to nutrition and health care, such as 
homeopathy. Conspiracy theories abound about the motivation of the FDA as well 
as lawmakers who support supplement regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has made the campaign so effective is that you have a zillion consumers 
who really believe in these products and want to make sure they not only have 
the right to take them but have the right to get information about them," said 
Patricia Knight, Hatch's health policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The grass-roots campaign fused the claims and safety issues as one in the 
public's mind. Critics contended that this was a deliberate tactic designed to 
frighten consumers into believing that they might lose their supplements, 
mobilizing them behind the industry's more subtle crusade to ease the standard 
for making health claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the big lie of 1993," said Bruce Silverglade, director of legal 
affairs for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy 
group. "The consumers who wrote Congress had a financial interest in the matter 
or were duped into believing the FDA was using the new labeling law to ban 
their favorite vitamins." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry has not relied on public pressure alone. It has spent more than 
$2 million lobbying Congress to pass the Hatch and Richardson bills, an 
analysis of public records by the center found. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry advocates insist the FDA's anti-supplement track record gives them 
reason to suspect the worst. They contend the agency has been reluctant to 
approve the claims that Congress instructed it to consider. And they say they 
do not consider the FDA a fair arbiter because it relies on scientists who 
oppose non-traditional approaches to nutrition and health. 
</P>
<P>
 "There needs to be an independent body looking at both ingredients and claims, 
but not necessarily the government," said Michael Ford, executive director of 
the National Nutritional Foods Assn., a coalition of 5,000 retailers, 
manufacturers and distributors. "FDA is utterly uninterested in input from the 
affected industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ford is among various industry mainstays who acknowledged discomfort 
with elements of the pro-supplement campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not agree with many of their tactics," said Kenneth M. Rosenberg, 
chairman of Pharmavite Corp. and head of the government relations committee for 
the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents mainstream 
manufacturers of vitamins and minerals and supports the Hatch-Richardson 
legislation. "We do not agree with much of their literature. We absolutely feel 
they have gone overboard in many instances." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign led Congress, at the industry's urging, to postpone initial 
implementation of the regulations implementing the 1990 labeling act.  
</P>
<P>
 On May 11, Kennedy's panel approved Hatch's bill on a 12-5 vote after 
rejecting Kennedy's alternative. The Hatch measure would preclude the FDA from 
treating any dietary supplements as drugs or food additives and delay 
imposition of the new restrictions on health claims for two to three years. It 
also would give the FDA emergency authority to act against dietary supplements 
that pose an imminent health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid to allay some opposition concerns, Hatch incorporated a proposal to 
create a congressionally appointed commission to conduct a two-year study of 
how to improve the process for determining the validity of health claims. And 
he vowed to revise the bill to allow the labeling act to take effect while the 
commission deliberates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health and environment and wrote the 1990 labeling law, said 
disputes remain over the standard of scientific support for health claims, and 
a provision of the bill that could allow prescription drugs to be sold as 
supplements without any safety review. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the FDA maintains that, no matter what consumers are told, it 
will continue to allow access to supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sell anything you want as long as it's safe," said the FDA's Zeller. "But if 
you're going to make a claim to treat or cure or reduce the risk of something 
like AIDS, cancer or Alzheimer's disease, you better have the science to back 
it up. If you don't have the science, you can sell your product; just don't 
make the claim that the science doesn't support."

'GREEN WIDOW' CONVICTED IN DEATHS OF HUSBAND, HIT MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels, dubbed the "Green Widow" because she spent the $500,000 
estate she inherited from her slain husband at a dizzying pace, was convicted 
Friday of two counts of first-degree murder for arranging the husband's 
December, 1988, shooting death -- and his executioner's strangulation death 
seven months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, who had denied from the witness stand that she was involved in either 
killing, leaned heavily against defense attorney Phil Nameth but showed no 
other reaction as the jury returned the verdicts, reached after 18 days of 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the investigating officer, who spent the final years of his career 
building the case against Samuels, broke down and cried. Sitting just a few 
feet away from her former sister-in-law, Susan Conroy also wept. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what people say about black widows? Well, she's a green widow. It's 
the same thing as a black widow, which eats its mate when he's no longer useful 
to her," retired Los Angeles Police Detective George Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very cunning predator." 
</P>
<P>
 The seven men and five women on the jury will return to court July 11 to 
determine whether Samuels, 45, should receive the death penalty or spend the 
rest of her life in prison for the murders of Robert Samuels, 45, a Hollywood 
camera operator's assistant, and James R. Bernstein, 27, a reputed drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's shocked," Nameth said of Samuels' reaction to the verdict. "Now, it's 
time to get down to the business of saving her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the first-degree murder convictions -- which included the special 
circumstances of multiple murders and murder for financial gain -- the jury 
convicted Samuels of two counts of conspiracy and two counts of solicitation of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors deadlocked on two other counts -- attempted murder and solicitation -- 
and on a special circumstance that the hit man was slain for financial gain. 
Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff declared mistrials on those counts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the lengthy trial, which unfolded like a pulp novel, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jan Maurizi alleged that Samuels plotted to have her husband killed when she 
realized "he was worth more to her dead than alive." 
</P>
<P>
 As a divorcee, Samuels would have received a settlement worth about $30,000. 
But as a widow, she inherited $500,000. She spent nearly all the money during 
the 13 months she was under investigation -- on a Porsche, a Cancun condo, a 
country club birthday bash, rented limousines, fake fur coats, trips to Las 
Vegas and custom-made outfits from a store called Trashy Lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she didn't pay for her husband's headstone, defaulted on her mortgage and 
failed to pay debts rung up by the family's Sherman Oaks sandwich shop, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Mary Ellen Gurnick, known by the nickname "Betty Boop" as she grew 
up just a few doors away from her future husband in Santa Ana, smiled and 
winked at spectators as the trial began, but appeared haggard as testimony drew 
to a close two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the key prosecution witnesses once were among Samuels' closest 
confidants. They described Samuels' search for a hit man and several botched 
attempts on her husband's life. Some of the former friends testified under 
grants of immunity from prosecution for their roles in the murder schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad part of this case is there were so many victims" besides the two men 
slain, Maurizi said. "Just about anybody whose life she touched became a 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, who worked on the films "Lethal Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," 
was ambushed in his Northridge home Dec. 8, 1988, by an intruder who hit him 
over the head, then shot him with a 16-gauge shotgun, firing through a pillow. 
Samuels and her daughter, Nicole, then 18, told police they discovered the body 
when they dropped off a pet schnauzer for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, who carried a business card identifying himself as a "specialist," 
was strangled to death on June 27, 1989, and his body was dumped in remote 
Lockwood Canyon, in Ventura County. According to testimony, the killers drove 
Samuels' black Toyota Celica convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters on the car's vanity plate were NAST VXN, for "nasty vixen." 
</P>
<P>
 The confessed killers, Paul Edwin Gaul and Darrell Ray Edwards, testified for 
the prosecution under plea bargains. Under the arrangement, both pleaded guilty 
to second-degree murder and received sentences of 15 years to life in prison. 
Gaul testified that he drank 30 to 40 beers the day they killed Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Nameth suggested that Samuels was framed by an overzealous detective and 
"fair-weather friends" who accused her to spare themselves from prosecution for 
their own roles in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Those witnesses painted an unflattering portrait of Samuels as a crass woman 
who hired male strippers for her daughter's 18th birthday and flirted with 
police the night she discovered her husband's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like bald guys," she told one detective, rubbing his hairless head, 
according to testimony. Later, however, she was not so friendly toward police. 
Several witnesses testified that she taught a pet parrot to make profane 
remarks about detective Daley. 
</P>
<P>
 Her trial played like a movie of the week, tracing a story line of puppy love 
among childhood neighbors that soured into deceit and betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, Mary Ellen and Robert Samuels grew up a block apart, 
and he had always been sweet on her. They met again in late 1979, following her 
failed first marriage, and wed in 1980. She left him six years later, leaving a 
"Dear John" note on the kitchen table, complaining that the marriage had gone 
"stale." 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens or what you think of me now or later, I will still 
always care for you, we just can't live together," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels and her daughter testified that Robert Samuels abused them, but their 
stories were uncorroborated by evidence, and she did not include abuse among 
her list of complaints in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Until two months before his death, Robert Samuels hoped they might reconcile, 
confiding to a friend that he was reading the self-help book "How to Save Your 
Marriage," according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then, testimony showed, Samuels and her daughter already were searching 
for someone to kill him. Several of Nicole's high school friends testified that 
she had asked if they knew where she could find a gun to kill her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months of her husband's death, Samuels took up with a new boyfriend, a 
concert promoter named Dean Groover who photographed her in a Cancun hotel 
room, wearing only $20,000 in cash and a smile. The photograph became a 
memorable piece of prosecution evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels denied she'd lived in the fast lane after her husband died. She 
testified that she "paid bills" with the insurance money, denying that her 
lifestyle changed. Later she conceded, "Naturally, I got to do more things." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Samuels-Moroianu also testified on her mother's behalf, even though 
prosecutors consider her an unindicted co-conspirator. She said Robert Samuels 
raped her, beginning when she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 During one court recess while Samuels-Moroianu was on the stand, the defendant 
smiled and mouthed the words, "I love you," to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love you more," Samuels-Moroianu responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi said prosecutors are still considering whether to file charges against 
the daughter.

REALTOR FOUND TIED UP IN RURAL ARIZONA MOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Val Verde real estate agent kidnaped at gunpoint on Wednesday was found tied 
up in an Arizona motel room Friday morning after a maid heard her cries and 
summoned help, witnesses and authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Harrington had disappeared after showing several homes in the small 
Santa Clarita Valley community to an unidentified male customer Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old real estate agent was locked in a room of the El Coronado 
Motel in Gila Bend, Ariz., about 10 a.m. when she was discovered bound and 
partially gagged on the bed, said motel manager Vinaykent Patel. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'I'm tied up and I can't open the door, call the police,' " said 
Patel, who was brought to the room by a maid who first heard the woman's cries. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, the kidnaper called Harrington's office to reveal where 
she was, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaper, described as a white man in his 40s, is still at large, 
authorities said. He had left the motel about an hour before Harrington was 
discovered, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI spokesman Jack Callahan said late Friday that Harrington had been 
assaulted. The FBI was investigating the case because the kidnaper crossed the 
state line. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some indications at this point that this is not the first time" that 
the suspect has kidnaped a woman, he said. "We are cautioning the public, 
especially women." 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan said they hoped to release a composite of the suspect today. 
</P>
<P>
 DeAnne Tippetts, the owner of the Century 21 office near Santa Clarita where 
Harrington worked, said she accepted a collect call about 10:30 a.m. Friday 
from a man who did not identify himself. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the man told her Harrington was unharmed in a motel room in Gila 
Bend, a town of about 1,747 people, located 68 miles southwest of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just in shock," Tippetts said. "I hoped it was real and I was elated at 
the thought she might be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 The call was brief and the man spoke calmly, trying to make sure she got the 
location right, Tippetts added. 
</P>
<P>
 Tippetts said she called 911, and Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
alerted Arizona police. Harrington was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital Medical 
Center in Phoenix for observation and questioning by police, said relatives of 
Harrington who had flown to Arizona to be with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington's husband, Chris, who also flew to Arizona on Friday afternoon, 
said he expects her to be able to return home today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday was my birthday . . . see if you can figure out the best present I 
received," said Chris Harrington during an impromptu news conference late 
Friday in the FBI offices in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Harrington said he spoke to his wife briefly on the phone 
and she seemed to be in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paula is the toughest woman in a crisis I've ever known," he said. "I'm sure 
she'll handle this as well as anyone could." 
</P>
<P>
 She did not discuss in detail what had happened to her, Harrington added. 
</P>
<P>
 Patel said the man who rented the room had checked into the motel about 9 p.m. 
Thursday, paying $24.42 for a double room. He registered under the name Joseph 
P. Sterling. Authorities could not confirm whether it was his true name. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked for a room with one bed and he said he wanted it with a good TV and 
a good air conditioner," Patel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patel said the man drove up in a blue-green Jeep Cherokee, which was gone the 
following morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, a medium-build white male in his 40s with thinning brown hair, is 
being sought, said Ron Spear, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Val Verde, population 1,500, were elated about the news. Many had 
helped search for Harrington on Thursday in the hills surrounding Val Verde, 
located about 10 miles northwest of Santa Clarita. They also distributed tens 
of thousands of flyers nationally asking for help in locating her. 
</P>
<P>
 Two friends of Harrington's hugged each other and jumped up and down with 
excitement at the Val Verde General Store when they learned Harrington had been 
found. Then they went outside and began waving down passing cars to spread the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she was gone," said one of the women, Breeze Pierce, 24. "I got a 
big lump in my throat when I thought they weren't going to find her." 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping incident began about 2 p.m. Wednesday when a man walked into 
Harrington's office, asking to look at homes in Val Verde. Several employees 
were on duty at the time and he did not ask specifically for Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 They drove to Val Verde in the man's Jeep Cherokee. Police officials said they 
believe the pair visited "four or five" homes because Harrington's business 
cards were found there. 
</P>
<P>
 A co-worker of Harrington's grew suspicious when Harrington did not return 
after about 2 1/2 hours and went to Val Verde to look for her. She spotted what 
she believed was the man's Jeep at a home about 4:30 p.m. and, feeling 
something was wrong, wrote down the license plate number and called for help 
from a nearby house. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jeep was gone when the co-worker returned. Investigators discovered the 
license plates on the vehicle had been stolen from a car in Pismo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington made an ATM withdrawal of $300 from a Bank of America branch in 
Hacienda Heights at 8:34 p.m. Wednesday, said Lt. Donald Bear of the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide bureau. A photo from the bank 
camera showing her head and shoulders did not reveal anyone in back or to the 
side of her, and she did not appear to be under duress. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looked like she was trying her best to cope with a bad situation," her 
husband said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials called off the search Thursday afternoon after learning of 
the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington's other family members said they were thrilled Harrington had been 
found. Her father, Richard Morse, said everyone tried to remain optimistic, but 
were very worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good not to have those negative thoughts anymore," he said. "It was 
going through all of our minds, whether spoken or unspoken." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabbatini, a Times correspondent, reported the story from Los Angeles. Kaplan, 
a Times staff writer, reported from Phoenix.

A RELUCTANT HEADLINER; DEPUTY D.A. MARCIA CLARK LIKES THE CHALLENGE OF 
HIGH-PROFILE CASES -- BUT NOT THE PUBLICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After police and crime scene experts had gathered all their evidence, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark sent them back to check a seemingly innocuous and 
overlooked item for fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they did what she wanted a bit grudgingly, the veteran prosecutor's 
thoroughness paid off. The prints played a central role in Clark winning a 
conviction in a double murder trial last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her mind is always clicking," said Sheriff's Sgt. Dirk Edmundson, a homicide 
detective who worked with Clark on that case. "She likes the challenge. She 
likes making the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Clark will be trying to make the most important case of her career, and 
the nation will be watching. Experts estimate that as many as one in four U.S. 
homes tuned in to the opening day of O.J. Simpson's preliminary hearing, in 
which Clark has taken the lead role. Her boss, Deputy Dist. Atty. William W. 
Hodgman, is backing her up as co-counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has already sparred openly and frequently with Simpson's lead defense 
attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, both in and out of court. She has engaged in some 
theatrics during the first two days of the preliminary hearing, at times calmly 
but sarcastically lecturing Shapiro on the finer points of law and evidence 
gathering. But Clark has done so only to protect her case and the evidence that 
she hopes will bolster it, say those who know and have worked with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she particularly cares for publicity. That is not her style," 
Edmundson said. "But she will counterpunch very well with someone who is a 
grandstander. She can counterpunch with the best of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brash, polished and confident courtroom demeanor has been praised by those 
who have worked with and against Clark since she joined the district attorney's 
office in 1981. But those who know Clark say her success in a series of 
high-profile cases lies not just in the courtroom, but outside as well. 
</P>
<P>
 She is particularly adept, they say, in getting police, witnesses, legal 
scholars and evidentiary experts to help her build an airtight case. By doing 
so, they say, she can anticipate the moves of defense lawyers so well that she 
can easily outmaneuver them once the courtroom battle ensues. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is aggressive, she is smart, she is fair and she is extremely honest," 
said Superior Court Judge Dino Fulgoni, a former prosecutor for almost 28 
years. "Probably what stands out most is her dedication and her desire to find 
out everything about a case. When she goes into a trial, she figures out what 
the defense is most likely to do and prepares a counter to it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Clark's most high-profile trial before the Simpson case, she persuaded 
Fulgoni in a 1991 non-jury trial to not only convict obsessed fan Robert John 
Bardo of fatally shooting actress Rebecca Schaeffer after stalking her, but to 
send him to Death Row. When the defense put nationally renowned psychiatrist 
Park Dietz on the stand to say Bardo acted in a moment of unpremeditated rage, 
Clark had her counterattack planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite obvious that when (Dietz) would try to divert her, she not only 
understood what he was doing but was way ahead of him and had a counter 
tactic," Fulgoni said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few who have worked with or against Clark have anything bad to say about her, 
except that her tenacity, her zeal to prosecute the perfect case and her 
demands can be overly taxing. But even they concede that in the end, Clark has 
won prosecutions in cases where others may not have and has won tougher 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 They note that police have been sent out to look for more clues and evidence 
to tie the former football great to the slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 During the preliminary hearing, Clark has appeared calm, collected and in 
control of the situation, despite facing a highly touted legal defense team, 
including Shapiro, Gerald Uelmen, F. Lee Bailey and Alan Dershowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 She has done most of the talking, even though Hodgman has tried twice as many 
murder cases (more than 40) and is her boss as director of central operations 
for the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 While associates say Hodgman is genial and almost professorial, Clark is 
routinely described as "hard as nails" and "in your face," particularly by 
adversaries.  
</P>
<P>
 "Marcia is an outstanding trial lawyer, effective in all phases of trial 
work," said Barry Levin, a defense attorney who fought Clark for 20 months in a 
murder case and lost. "She is what a prosecutor should be. She is tough, she is 
fair and you can't intimidate her. I know. I tried to do that many times." 
</P>
<P>
 But those who know her also say she is highly intelligent, quiet and 
sensitive, with a keen sense of humor and an ability to get along well with 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, 41, is a graduate of UCLA with a degree in political science. After 
graduating in 1974, she attended the Southwestern University School of Law, 
receiving her law degree in 1979 and passing the Bar the same year. After two 
years in private practice with a highly touted criminal defense firm, she 
became a prosecutor.  
</P>
<P>
 Clark appears to relish a good courtroom battle. Edmundson, the sheriff's 
homicide investigator, remembers when Clark geared up to work on the earlier 
double-murder case, in which two Russian nationals were charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost like in sports, when you get an adrenaline rush before a big 
game," he said. "She got that hungry look, like a rush was coming on." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Bardo case, Clark has won convictions in a number of high-profile 
cases, including that of Albert Lewis and Anthony Oliver, half brothers who in 
1989 used a sawed-off shotgun to fire into a Bible class at the Mt. Olive 
Church of God in South-Central Los Angeles, killing two. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark also helped handle the successful two-year prosecution of James Hawkins 
Jr., a onetime Watts folk hero convicted and sentenced to life in prison for 
drug-related slayings. She also helped obtain convictions against four 
defendants accused in the 1985 murders of a UCLA student and her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has steadfastly kept her personal life private. Those who have worked 
closely with her say they know little about her outside life, except that she 
is married and has at least one young child and that she once was a 
professional dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said Friday that he picked Clark for one of his 
office's highest profile cases because she "simply is a special talent as a 
trial lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that she is remarkably effective as a trial advocate," 
Garcetti said. "She is very fair, but at the same time, she doesn't let anyone 
push her around." 
</P>
<P>
 But even Garcetti said he knows so little about Clark that he does not know if 
she has a family. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is an incredibly hard worker," he said. "She is married to the district 
attorney's office."

NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF L.A. HOMES WATCHED HEARING, RATINGS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An average of 61% of the homes watching television in the Los Angeles area -- 
or a total of 1.2 million households -- tuned in to the first day of O.J. 
Simpson's preliminary hearing Thursday, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures 
released Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 That number rises even higher when taking into account such outlets as Cable 
News Network and Court TV. Cable TV ratings were not available on a local basis 
for either network. 
</P>
<P>
 For the entire Los Angeles market including cable TV, daytime viewing from 8 
a.m., when local news coverage began, to 5 p.m., shortly after the Simpson 
hearing concluded, was up about 10% from the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three networks, which carried the hearing live to the rest of the 
country, had a 24% increase in their combined ratings, according to preliminary 
Nielsen reports from 31 markets. The trade publication Electronic Media 
estimated that 20% to 25% of all U.S. homes tuned in to the networks' coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Until national numbers are released next week, there is no way to determine 
the total number of people who saw the hearing, because ratings measure TV 
households and not individual viewers. Because the hearing took place during a 
workday, the ratings would not take into account large groups of office workers 
gathered around TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS-TV Channel 2 led all local coverage with a 5.1 rating during the live 
portion of the hearing, followed closely by KNBC-TV Channel 4 with a 5 rating 
and KABC-TV Channel 7 with 4.7. (Each ratings point represents 50,064 homes). 
The ratings peaked from 11 a.m. to noon, right before the hearing broke for 
lunch, and then again during the last hour, when key witnesses finally 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN reported that a national average of 2.3 million households saw its live 
courtroom coverage, which is very high for a basic cable channel. CNN's 
national rating for the entire day was up 200% from last month's average.

The justices ruled that pretrial publicity and courthouse "bedlam" had cost 
Sheppard a fair trial. Sheppard had been convicted in the 1954 slaying of of

INMATE WINS NO PLAQUE FLOSSING WAY OVER WALL 
</P>

 Robert Shepard did not need a file baked in a cake to get out of jail. 
Instead, he used dental floss to make his escape. 
</P>
<P>
 While cameras, guards and computer-controlled doors were keeping other inmates 
in, Shepard reportedly braided the floss into a rope as thick as a telephone 
cord and used it to scale an 18-foot wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, people are talking of Shepard as a real-life Spiderman -- the comic-book 
character who spins his web and hangs from ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wonder how he got ahold of so much dental floss," said Mike Reiser, 
who lives near the South Central Regional Jail in South Charleston. "What did 
this guy do? Walk around with stuff in his mouth all the time?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard, 34, escaped Wednesday from the recreation yard, which is topped by a 
chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-9, 155-pound inmate apparently attached a weight to the floss cord 
and hurled it upward to loop through the fence. He then apparently used it to 
help him climb the cinder block wall, and hung from the cord while he cut 
through the fence with a three-inch piece of hacksaw blade. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard remained at large Friday. He had been awaiting trial on charges of 
robbing a post office. His record includes convictions for manslaughter and 
armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the escape, he was being disciplined with reduced privileges 
for using a handmade tool to scrape mortar in his cell. He was not allowed in 
the exercise yard until late at night, after other inmates were locked in their 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how much floss it takes to make a rope of such a size has not been 
documented. Packages typically contain 55 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail Administrator Larry Parsons said officials were checking records to see 
how much Shepard may have bought at the commissary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just find it incredible that somebody could use something that thin," 
Parsons said. "He's almost taken on superhuman qualities." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, inmates will have to clean their teeth with something else. 
Sales of floss have been suspended.

BLACK COALITION THREATENS TO BOYCOTT S.C. OVER FLAG DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of black leaders threatened Friday to lead a boycott against South 
Carolina and its tourism industry if the state does not remove the Confederate 
flag from the Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition of about 50 people, including the chairman of the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People, said it would hold a protest march July 
23 in Myrtle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Confederate flag, which is red with white stars emblazoned on a blue 
cross, is considered by many to be a racist symbol of the Old South, dating to 
the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature adjourned last month without agreeing to remove the flag, 
leaving South Carolina as the only state that permits the banner to fly atop 
its Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is no positive movement to bring the flag down by the time of the 
July 23 march, the coalition will activate its other strategies," the group 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Black leaders upset about the flag are considering a lawsuit, a 
voter-registration drive and a national economic boycott of the state's 
$7.3-billion tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking for compromise," said William Gibson, national chairman of 
the NAACP. "We're saying it violates our rights, and it should be nowhere on 
the grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said economic sanctions against the state would have the backing of the 
650,000-member NAACP, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group. But 
he said the coalition first wants to see whether an anti-flag lawsuit filed 
against the state by Columbia Mayor Bob Coble and area business leaders will 
have any effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. is trying to persuade legislators to reconvene 
for a special session to consider removing the flag, which has flown atop the 
Statehouse since 1962. He said he favors a compromise that would allow the flag 
to be flown next to two Confederate monuments on Statehouse grounds, where a 
civil rights monument also would be built.

 The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees will move its headquarters to the 
Gaza Strip from Vienna by the end of next year, a U.N. statement said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement released in Cairo said the move was requested by Palestine 
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees employs about 8,000 
Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and is implementing projects there worth 
$80 million, UNRWA has said.

AS ARAFAT GETS A HERO'S WELCOME, ISRAELIS FIND IT HARD TO CELEBRATE; RETURN: 
EVEN LIBERAL JEWS SAY THEY DESPISE THE MAN. BUT THEY CONCEDE HE IS BEST CHANCE 
FOR PEACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For more than 25 years, his name was an evil word in Jewish households. So it 
wasn't easy for Israelis, even those who support the Mideast peace process, to 
watch the live broadcasts Friday of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's triumphant 
return to Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to say I don't enjoy watching him," said Michael Hocherman, 60, a 
businessman who saw the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman's arrival 
and speech to thousands of Palestinian supporters on Israeli television. "I 
know that if we want to move forward, he's the man we have to deal with. But he 
is someone I actually detest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He heads an organization whose sole aim was to kill as many of us as 
possible," Hocherman said. "I just can't forget that." 
</P>
<P>
 Those feelings of ambivalence were echoed by political moderates and liberals 
across much of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the day belonged to the Palestinians and Arafat. And many Israelis 
preferred to regard Arafat's visit as just another step in a peace process that 
they hope will guarantee their security in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli political right, which opposes any attempt to relinquish territory 
occupied by Israel, was relatively quiet Friday as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of police were deployed in Jerusalem and the Old City against 
threatened right-wing protests. But, for the most part, the demonstrations were 
small, disorganized and poorly attended. Larger protests were planned for 
today.  
</P>
<P>
 For most Jewish Israelis, though, the day was another reminder of how much the 
political face of the region has changed in less than a year -- and a reminder 
of how much change is still likely to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's return was featured in the country's most-watched weekly TV magazine 
show, which opened with the grinning leader being warmly welcomed to the Gaza 
Strip by a former Israeli military commander of the territory, which is now run 
by Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll work for peace, together," Arafat was heard saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in Israel found the whole scene a bit difficult to stomach, given 
Arafat's long status as Israel's No. 1 enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, we believed that Arafat was the devil, and it's not easy to change 
your opinions," said Naomi Kasow, 27, who works in marketing for a Tel Aviv 
company. "Today, looking at his face on TV, it didn't inspire me. I don't think 
he's credible in any way. But he is obviously a symbol to Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, she said, "I try to detach myself and realize this is just part 
of the peace process. Most of us in Israel have changed our thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Romy Teshuva, 31, a teacher of special-education classes on Israel's coast, 
said she is not quite ready to accept the change in Arafat's image from 
terrorist to political moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd be sick to my stomach when I saw him, and that didn't happen," 
Teshuva said. "But he still represents a very fanatic type of people. If he's 
participating in this peace process, it's not for us. It's for what he hopes to 
gain." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be only natural that Israelis, even those now coming to terms with the 
national aspirations of Palestinians, would be suspicious of the PLO leader, a 
man they believe still harbors designs on all of Israel and, especially, the 
holy city of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during more than four hours of television coverage of Arafat's 
arrival, one of the Israeli TV reporters said he believed that he was "starting 
to feel some of the excitement that these Palestinians feel." 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on," his co-host replied. "Don't get carried away." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I feel," said Teshuva, who was watching at her home in Netanya. 
"Even if you go along with it, you don't have to get swept up by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli rightists have vowed to protest Arafat's visit, and militant Jewish 
settlers have threatened violence if he decides to come to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish settler leaders had put a reward of 100,000 shekels, about $33,000, for 
his "capture." Posters around Jerusalem refer to Arafat as the "arch-murderer." 
</P>
<P>
 Right-wing protesters disrupted some traffic in Jerusalem on Friday. But they 
scaled back their estimates of the turnout they expect at a mass rally planned 
for Jerusalem today from 250,000 to 100,000. The rally will be an important 
show of support for the government's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some right-wing leaders insist that Arafat plans a secret stop in Jerusalem, 
the city claimed by both Israel and Palestinians. The government and PLO 
officials say no such trip is planned this weekend, although an Arafat visit to 
Jerusalem at some point is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's militant remarks in recent months have worried many Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Many point out that when South Africa's Nelson Mandela emerged from prison in 
1990, he issued an unequivocal commitment to work for peaceful solutions to 
that country's problems. Arafat, however, has kept some of his militant 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things he says don't affect my commitment to the rightness of the peace 
process," said Michael Hocherman's daughter, Riva, a 32-year-old book editor in 
Tel Aviv. "But it creates a nagging doubt in people's minds. They think that 
there might be some credence to the right's concerns. And that makes it 
difficult for moderates like myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasow says she is a "true believer" in the peace pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this hope of mine is tainted, because I know that most of our peace 
partners do not wholeheartedly see this peace the same way that we do," she 
said. "We Israelis are changing our attitudes, but I worry that (the 
Palestinians) haven't." 
</P>
<P>
 Hocherman added: "I don't feel comfortable when I see Arafat here, for reasons 
I don't completely understand myself. But the man has to establish a base here 
and become a permanent fixture on the political landscape. In some ways, I'm 
happy it's him and not someone else. But I don't have to like it."

A DREAM BECOMES REALITY FOR ARAFAT; AUTONOMY: THE PLO CHIEF'S UNEXPECTED DEBUT 
IN GAZA MARKS AN EMOTIONAL ENCOUNTER WITH THE HISTORY OF HIS MOVEMENT AND HIS 
OWN PAST. 
</P>

<P>
 There was a perceptible moment of silence when Yasser Arafat, the feisty 
revolutionary who badgered the world into accepting his nation without a state, 
stepped out of his car, bent down and kissed the hot earth here. 
</P>
<P>
 Then this hellish outpost of unsettled humanity, beloved of almost no one, 
erupted in joy as the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman launched his 
improbable reunion with his people. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked a turning point in the 46-year-old Palestinian struggle and an 
appointment with destiny of sorts for the 64-year-old leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Images that might have seemed unbelievable only a few months ago played across 
the dusty, stench-filled streets through a long day of chaos and euphoria: 
</P>
<P>
 * Arafat hoisted on the shoulders of his police as they shouted: "With our 
blood and our souls we defend you!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Arafat squeezing through throngs so enthusiastic his face was pinched into a 
grimace between the shoulders of his bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 * An old lady with a gold tooth trilling the ululation of joy that, for this 
day at least, replaced the wailing and keening that for so many years have been 
the song of Gaza's mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was because I am happy from the heart," said the woman, Miriam, whose son 
was recently released from a Gaza prison. "God willing, we have a new life." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a heavy burden to carry for this slight, ailing leader -- the 
expectations that a Palestinian government, so far confused and half-formed, 
will be able to turn Gaza's broiling refugee camps and squalid slums, morose 
and disheartened after 27 years of Israeli occupation, into a future of 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to tens of thousands in the old Parliament square near the former 
Israeli army headquarters, Arafat emphasized the job ahead, saying: "I want to 
remind you that we have a big mission ahead of us, a big mission to build this 
homeland, to build our institutions, and to rebuild the institutions the 
Israeli army destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 For Arafat, the unexpected debut in Gaza -- most PLO officials had been 
planning an orderly trip to the more sedate Jericho, the other outpost of 
Palestinian self-rule -- was an emotional encounter with the history of his 
movement and his own past. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat last set foot in Palestine in 1968, as a guerrilla leader and founder 
of the Fatah movement, slipping in and then out of the West Bank in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his earliest days as a young student protester were spent chanting 
slogans in Gaza's streets. It was in the sweltering refugee camps outside Gaza 
City that the Palestinian intifada -- the uprising against the Israeli 
occupation -- erupted in 1987, changing the course of the struggle for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 As Arafat made his way from an airfield in neighboring Egypt to the border , 
he grew increasingly ebullient, nervous about the reception but conscious of 
the route his motorcade was tracing through history , his aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a very good mood. Not just good, great. Very high emotions. And 
then with the crowds, the people, you see how big the crowd was -- unbelievable 
in every way!" said Mohammed Sobhieh, secretary general of the Palestine 
National Council, who accompanied the chairman. "For him, for us, for all of 
us, it was a very sensitive, a very extraordinary moment. I was last here 28 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of it," Sobhieh continued. "After that long, long march of blood, 
agony, problems, depression, appealing to the U.N. and international opinion, 
massacres here and there, then the difficulty of the peace talks, the Schultz 
plan, the Baker plan, the Madrid conference. You put that all together, and 
then you step into Gaza -- it is indescribable." 
</P>
<P>
 Nabil Shaath, a senior Arafat adviser and member of the new Palestinian 
Authority, added: "I don't think I've ever seen a day like it. It's the stuff 
that historic moments are painted of -- this is a historic moment that will 
never go away." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jamil Tarifi, another Palestinian Authority member, admitted that Arafat's 
job has only begun. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the chairman must now marshal the divided factions that are still 
debating the wisdom of peace, push for international donations to fund the new 
self-rule government and build a nation out of a land of desperate refugees and 
dispirited farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's visit to Gaza, he said, is a signal that the Palestinian leadership 
is up to the job -- and that it still needs its leader to finish it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need him from now, and not just now. We need him from yesterday," Tarifi 
said. "He was outside because he was forced to be outside. Now, you can't ask 
any people, 'Do you need your president?' Of course we need him!" 
</P>
<P>
 Delegations of Palestinian well-wishers from Gaza and the West Bank pushed 
into the seaside Palestine Hotel. Arafat was there holding court, as his new 
Palestinian police, newly drawn from the ranks of the Palestine Liberation Army 
all over the Arab world, tried to unsnarl the traffic bedlam outside. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the crowd of about 70,000 in the main square was far short of the 
500,000 optimistically predicted, thousands of families and young men lingered 
long after Arafat's black-and-white headdress, barely visible above a sea of 
bodyguards, had been whisked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "He greeted the children of the stone, and that includes most of us," said 
Mohammed Youssef Nejam, a 27-year-old student who was among a generation of 
young Palestinians whose lobbed rocks at armed Israeli soldiers earned the 
world's sympathy for an occupied Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the stone children were the main reason we reached this point, and he 
greeted all the Palestinians, regardless of their factions or parties, all the 
Palestinians without any discrimination," Nejam noted of Arafat. "I can tell 
you that (Arafat) is the father of every Palestinian here." 
</P>
<P>
 Munching on a corn on the cob from one of the dozens of street vendors around 
the plaza, Bassam Nasser, 25, conceded that Arafat will not be able to solve 
Gaza's heartaches over the course of a four-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the problems will be solved after this visit," he said. "But 
just to see Arafat up there, it makes people think that we are achieving our 
dream. It's the next step of our revolution which started in Gaza."

U.S. SCRAMBLES TO ACCOMMODATE HAITI REFUGEES; CARIBBEAN: UP TO 1,000 PEOPLE A 
DAY ARE ARRIVING AT TEMPORARY PROCESSING CENTERS IN JAMAICA AND CUBA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 For Haitian teacher Prophet Guerrier, his pregnant wife, Yolette, and their 
five children, Friday had a happy ending. After 24 hours aboard a white U.S. 
Navy hospital ship where he had recounted the harrowing murder of his parents 
and years of living in fear in his native land, U.S. immigration authorities 
said "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Guerriers are coming to America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy because we knew we could not go back to Haiti," said Guerrier, 
37, as he and his family sat in a Jamaican shuttle bus whose side was painted 
with the words: "Smile With Pleasure Tours." 
</P>
<P>
 The children were wide-eyed and silent as the bus took them from the ship to a 
military transport plane bound for the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
Their parents, a week after leaving Petite Goave in a small boat, looked 
stunned with fatigue and good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is fast becoming one of the largest, most complex emergency 
immigration operations in U.S. history, the tide of refugees continued to build 
Friday. Since June 15, the U.S. Coast Guard has picked up more than 7,000 
Haitians fleeing a country in the grip of economic sanctions designed to drive 
its military rulers from power. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a migration fueled by oppression, poverty -- and much-improving odds of 
winning asylum in the United States. As many as 1,000 Haitians a day are making 
the trip to a processing center, either here aboard the hospital ship in 
Kingston Harbor or a rapidly expanding tent city at Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 30 of every 100 Haitians interviewed have been judged to have a 
well-founded fear of persecution, a huge increase over the five in 100 who had 
been granted asylum before last month. After a complete physical exam at 
Guantanamo, where they will be tested for tuberculosis and AIDS, all those 
granted asylum will be permitted to enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The large numbers of immigrants sent military officials at Guantanamo 
scrambling to accommodate them. Working around the clock to build shelters, 
they warned that they could not absorb the current flow of migrants for long. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon Friday, 1,956 Haitians had arrived, including 1,081 on Thursday alone, 
and there is space for only 12,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Base officials are providing refugees with meals and clothing while 
constructing tent villages. They are determined not to repeat the mistakes of 
1992, when Haitians flooded the base, exceeded the capacity of facilities built 
for them and threatened to riot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was any lesson learned, it's that you've got to show these people 
that there's some kind of flow-through," said Col. Michael Pearson, a 21-year 
veteran of the U.S. Army who heads the joint operation at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pearson said he does not expect to begin processing the migrants, who must 
be interviewed by Immigration and Naturalization Service adjudicators, until 
next week. Refugees who pass INS screening must wait at the base until the 
State Department finds a U.S. family or group to sponsor them. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson repeatedly underscored the need to process refugees before they fill 
the facility to overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got to move on," he said. "I've got to assume the flow out of Haiti 
is going to remain fairly constant." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the stories the migrants are telling are any indication, he is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 A 29-year-old man wearing a gray Honolulu surfing T-shirt said that Haitian 
military officers jailed and beat him after he protested the coup that ousted 
elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Army death squads are still seeking 
him, he said, and he left when President Clinton announced that the United 
States would begin processing migrants. He would not give his name, saying that 
he feared retribution from the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Approved for refugee status, he said that he hopes to find a job in Florida. 
"Anything I find will be better than Haiti," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man, wearing a faded light blue T-shirt and sandals, said that 
soldiers shot at him as he ran to a boat leaving Haiti. He had arranged to 
rendezvous with the boat elsewhere in case of trouble, he said, and managed to 
escape. Others were not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty people were shot down trying to get on the boat," said the man, who 
gave his first name as St. Hubert. He spent three days on a 17-foot vessel with 
62 other people before a Coast Guard cutter intercepted them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the refugees collected by Coast Guard cutters are now being taken 
directly to Guantanamo, but earlier refugees were taken to Jamaica. Aboard the 
hospital ship, Haitians are put into an assembly line that processes asylum 
claims around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 New arrivals are given surgical masks in case they have tuberculosis, a 
computer chip identification bracelet and a promise that their stories will be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who need to be treated delicately and given a careful 
interview," said Bo Cooper, an INS attorney. "There is no quota on the number 
granted asylum. We know conditions in Haiti are bad, but each case is 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of Haitians are still shuttled to Port-au-Prince, the Haitian 
capital, either because they are deemed to be lying or because they cannot 
prove that they would be in fear of persecution back home. 
</P>
<P>
 With a multi-agency staff of 1,100, the floating processing center here can 
handle several hundred migrants a day. But Friday almost 1,000 Haitians were 
aboard and many would wait 24 hours before sitting for their first interview.

ASYLUM-SEEKERS QUIT HAVANA OCCUPATION OF BELGIAN FACILITY

 The last of 124 asylum-seekers have ended an occupation of the Belgian 
ambassador's residence in Havana, nearly ending a crisis for diplomats in the 
Cuban capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The last 16 asylum seekers left Thursday, Luis Garcia Peraza, subdirector for 
Europe at the Cuban Foreign Ministry, told the official Prensa Latina news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The 124 Cubans, who had vowed to die before leaving, raided the ambassador's 
residence May 28. In following weeks, about 21 people invaded the German 
Embassy and eight forced their way into the Chilean consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the Chilean mission later left, but the German Embassy remains 
occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba has been adamant that people entering diplomatic premises illegally will 
not leave the country in this way. Officials toughened their stance 10 days 
ago, saying people who forced their way into a diplomatic mission would not be 
able to leave in any way.

MAURITANIA PLANE CRASH KILLS 94; SANDSTORM CITED 
</P>

<P>
 An Air Mauritania passenger plane crashed Friday at an airport in the central 
part of the West African nation, killing 94 of the 101 people on board, 
aviation authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sandstorm appeared to be the cause of the accident, according to the 
officials.But they said they were receiving different accounts from the scene 
as to how the storm caused the plane to crash as it was landing at Tidjikja, in 
a mountainous region of Mauritania. 
</P>
<P>
 One report said the plane exploded when it touched down after experiencing 
landing difficulties during the sandstorm. Another said the plane exploded 82 
feet above ground after it flew into the sandstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, if not all, of the passengers were Mauritanians, the Mauritanian Press 
Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was on a domestic flight from the capital, Nouakchott, to Tidjikja, 
a regional capital about 250 miles east of Nouakchott, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane went down shortly after 9 a.m. Rescue teams were at work searching 
for victims and aiding survivors, the agency said.

BRAZIL INTRODUCES NEW CURRENCY; ECONOMY: THE CHANGE WAS PART OF THE EIGHTH 
ECONOMIC PLAN IN 12 YEARS. THE GOAL IS TO DRIVE DOWN CHRONIC INFLATION, WHICH 
EXCEEDED 2,700% LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Manuel Lira dos Santos spread his thick, muscled arms out toward the throng of 
buyers and vegetable and meat vendors haggling over prices Friday in the huge 
outdoor weekly Ipanema market. 
</P>
<P>
 He sighed. "Everybody is a little crazy today," he said from behind the stand 
where he sells chicken parts. "You can feel it. Everybody is a little nuts 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 And why shouldn't they be? The entire country changed money in what may be one 
of the globe's largest currency swaps. For Brazil, the exchange was part of its 
eighth economic plan in 12 years, the latest effort to drive down the dizzying 
inflation that has plagued this country for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, from remote patches in the Amazon to the huge commercial center of 
Sao Paulo, a nation of 155 million people -- who participate in the world's 
eighth-largest economy -- began switching $5 billion worth of cruzeiro reals to 
the real, a new currency pegged to the U.S. dollar, in what one economist 
likened to "changing the engine on a 747 while it's still in flight." 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials hope that the new currency, backed by $40 billion in 
reserves, can beat down inflation, which last year topped 2,700% and which was 
running at 50% for just last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In brief, the theory is that Brazil's money change will break the inflationary 
psychology: There will be fewer units of currency chasing after goods, and the 
value of the money will be more firmly anchored. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts predict that the plan will almost surely have an immediate impact, 
possibly pushing inflation down to a mere 2% monthly by mid-August. The 
question, for which nobody has an answer, is how long this will last. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the confusion, hope, frustration and anxiety among shoppers around 
Dos Santos' stand stood as microcosm of a nation that is greeting a new plan 
that effectively has forced everyone to deal with high mathematics to calculate 
what costs what. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't pay in reals! I won't pay in reals!" shouted one woman as she eyed 
Dos Santos' prices posted in the new currency. He calmed her by reminding her 
that cruzeiros are still good for a time, then whipped out his pocket 
calculator to figure the price in the old money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, almost nobody brings a calculator, but, today, everybody has one," 
Dos Santos said as he punched in the numbers: 2,700 cruzeiro reals for one 
real.  
</P>
<P>
 Customers, however, remain confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is two reals?" one woman whispered to her husband as she eyed Dos 
Santos' chicken necks. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion on Friday kept shoppers away, vendors agreed, particularly in the 
poorer sections of town where the uneducated and even the merchants had 
difficulty figuring prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers are particularly wary because most merchants have increased prices 
sharply in anticipation of government steps to freeze them, as part of the 
real-linked inflation fight; incomes were virtually frozen, as the government 
did away with monthly salary increases, designed to keep up with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think I'm hallucinating when I see the prices," said lawyer Vera 
Lucia Viana, shaking her head at Dos Santos' wares. 
</P>
<P>
 She was discussing a major criticism of the government anti-inflation plan, an 
objection that has been raised particularly by union leaders, such as Vicente 
Paulo da Silva, president of the largest union in Latin America. Opponents say 
the plan has eroded worker salaries and "frozen the poor in their misery." 
</P>
<P>
 But economists, such as Helio Portocarrero, a university professor and head of 
the local Economics Council, are unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prices which are unrealistic will have to come back down as the currency 
stabilizes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulo claims that the real comes suspiciously at a time when it could help the 
presidential campaign of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister 
who devised the plan. Cardoso, now trailing front-runner Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva in the polls, has staked much of his campaign on the plan's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it works, it will certainly make me look much more favorably on him," said 
Joao Paulo Loureiro Martin, 54, a marble salesman at the market.  
</P>
<P>
 As for Dos Santos, he doesn't really care about Cardoso; he just hopes that 
the plan will be good for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists hope so too, but not immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 If consumers embark on a buying spree, they fear, it will fuel inflation. 
Consequently, banks are expected to raise interest rates to 5% monthly to make 
saving more desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 High interest rates will also boost the economy by attracting foreign 
investment, which already has been on the upswing in anticipation of the real.

NEW SHIPPING RULES BRING TURKEY INTO CONFLICT WITH RUSSIA, NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

</BYLINE>

<P>
 Giving no leeway to criticism from Russia, Greece and Black Sea countries, 
Turkey on Friday imposed new safety regulations on the Turkish straits, one of 
the world's busiest international waterways -- and one that is also potentially 
hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on a quayside decked with flags in honor of the young Turkish 
republic's 1926 declaration of sovereignty over its territorial waters, Ibrahim 
Tez, the minister in charge of shipping, promised that Turkey had no intention 
of blocking free passage of commercial ships as guaranteed by the 1936 Montreux 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic philosophy is to make free passage mean safe passage," Tez said. 
"Ships passing through the straits have grown unimaginably in size, tonnage, 
speed, loads and environmental hazards. But the physical dimensions of the 
straits remain the same." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1936, one or two ships a day passed through the Turkish straits, the name 
for the 180-mile waterway from the Aegean Sea to the Black Sea through the 
Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara and the Bosporus. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1993, a record 64 foreign-flag ships a day, plus a similar number of 
Turkish vessels, passed through. More can be expected as Europe's canal systems 
expand and Russia loses easy access to Baltic ports. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Montreux Convention, even inexperienced captains are not required to 
take aboard a pilot to guide them through the Bosporus, a tricky waterway that 
narrows to half a mile or so and is plagued by fast, shifting currents. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from much stricter controls over positions in shipping lanes, the new 
regulations mainly set down in writing what Turkish controllers were doing 
already: Since a bad oil tanker accident in March, tankers and ships longer 
than 660 feet have been restricted to daylight hours and one-way traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow has said it will not recognize the new regulations, saying they will 
lead to a buildup of ships waiting to pass through. Other articles allowing 
controllers to close down the straits or to refuse passage to "dangerous" ships 
also worry Russia and other Black Sea states that rely on the straits for 
access to the world's warm-water seas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The regulations . . . are blatantly against Montreux Convention and the 
international norms relating to international waterways," the Russian Embassy 
in Turkey said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, Russia and Turkey are also struggling over which route will 
be used to bring oil from new fields in Siberia, Central Asia and Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow wants to use the Black Sea port of Novorossisk; Turkey wants the 
fee-paying pipelines over its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turkish Foreign Ministry says Russia plans to ship up to 100 million tons 
of crude a year from Novorossisk, a load for about three huge tankers a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulations could limit oil shipping during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Turkish straits cannot be considered an oil transportation route," the 
Foreign Ministry said. "The building of oil pipelines over Turkish territory . 
. . is feasible, environmentally much safer and more secure and logical in 
every sense."

NEW JAPANESE LEADER TRIES TO REASSURE U.S.; ASIA: SOCIALIST PREMIER VOWS 'NO 
CHANGE AT ALL' IN FOREIGN POLICY. HE ACKNOWLEDGES WORLD'S UNEASINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's first Socialist prime minister in 47 years, 
declared Friday that he will make "no change at all" in Japan's foreign policy 
and will continue to treat U.S.-Tokyo relations as the "axis" of Japanese 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first news conference since Parliament elected him Wednesday to head a 
coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party and New Party Harbinger, Murayama 
acknowledged that his selection and the "unstable political conditions in 
Japan" have created "uneasiness" at home and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will try to create a long-lived government that foreigners and 
Japanese would view as stable. 
</P>
<P>
 And he appealed to Japanese to drop their view of the Socialists as a radical 
party. Socialists, he noted, had already abandoned advocacy of socialism in 
their party platform and policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pragmatism, not polemics, will be his operating formula, Murayama indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he even declared that "just because we (Socialists) opposed 
bills when they were submitted in the past doesn't mean we oppose them now that 
they are law." 
</P>
<P>
 He also predicted that nearly four decades of bitter confrontation with the 
conservative Liberal Democrats will end. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate telephone conversations, Murayama offered assurances of continuity 
in diplomacy to President Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 To Clinton, he added that he will continue to regard relations with the United 
States as the "axis" of Japanese diplomacy and will maintain the U.S.-Japan 
Security Treaty, despite his party's long -- albeit dormant -- advocacy of 
abolishing the accord and removing U.S. bases from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will discuss continuing negotiations on a framework for U.S.-Japan 
trade when he meets Clinton and attends the seven-nation economic summit next 
week in Naples, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama promised to continue consultations with Washington and Seoul on North 
Korea and its nuclear program. But he added that "there is no change at all in 
our insistence that the North Korean nuclear problem must, to the end, be 
settled through dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 In a policy agreement worked out with its coalition partners, Murayama's 
Socialists declared that Japan will cooperate with "the gist" of any U.N. 
sanctions that might be imposed if North Korea again balks on inspections of 
its nuclear facilities. The former coalition headed by Hata had offered an 
outright promise to implement any U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70-year-old leader, the hair from his massive, graying eyebrows dangling 
over his eyes, appeared relaxed and confident as he fielded questions. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that he is coming into office with "a very low ratio of 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 In a TV-Asahi opinion poll, two-thirds of respondents said they were 
"surprised" or "appalled" that a Socialist became prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority said the new Cabinet was formed "just by putting numbers together" 
to form a majority and said they expected a policy fallout among coalition 
partners to occur "sooner or later." Most expected the Cabinet to last "about 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
 If they had had the opportunity, 57.9% of the respondents said they would have 
voted for former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in Wednesday's lower house 
election for prime minister. Only 21.7% said they would have picked Murayama, 
and only 35.5% said they support his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 A Yomiuri newspaper poll published today put support for the Murayama Cabinet 
at 39%. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama urged Japanese to drop preconceptions that his Cabinet is lukewarm on 
political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 He promised to enact by "early autumn" a redistricting bill to implement 
single-seat election districts in the lower house -- replacing constituencies 
from which an average of four representatives have been chosen. No election 
will be held before then, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 He also called for passage of a bill to strengthen penalties against bribery. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his party's fierce opposition to Japan dispatching troops overseas to 
participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations, Murayama said he supports active 
participation in such missions -- as long as the use of force is not involved.

'MULTIPLE ERRORS' CITED IN IRAQ COPTER TRAGEDY; MIDEAST: PENTAGON REPORT 
DETAILS MISTAKES MADE IN 'FRIENDLY FIRE' INCIDENT. DISCIPLINE OF THOSE INVOLVED 
IS EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mistaken destruction of two U.S. Army helicopters by a pair of American 
F-15C jet fighters over Iraq in April resulted from "multiple errors" by the 
pilots, air controllers and their unit commanders, a Pentagon investigation 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The report points out that, while air controllers on a nearby U.S. AWACS radar 
surveillance plane knew that the two helicopters were American, they failed to 
tell others aboard who were overseeing the F-15Cs -- a step that almost 
certainly would have prevented the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the F-15C pilots themselves did not fly close enough to 
identify the helicopters properly -- missing the large U.S. flags that were 
painted on their fuel tanks and misidentifying the two choppers as Soviet-built 
Iraqi Hinds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon report, now being reviewed by Defense Secretary William J. Perry, 
is expected to lead to the disciplining of several of those involved. The 
incident killed 26 people: 15 Americans; six British, French and Turkish 
officers, and five Kurdish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy occurred inside the restricted "no fly" zone over northern Iraq, 
set up by the allies three years ago to help protect Kurds from Iraqi 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Those traveling in the two U.S. helicopters were on a tour of Kurdish 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon declined comment on the report's conclusions, portions of which 
were reported in Friday's New York Times and in the June 17 Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Perry probably will decide the issue next week, then brief 
next of kin of those killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seattle, where he delivered a speech Friday, Perry told reporters that the 
Pentagon plans to take further steps to prevent future "friendly fire" 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very clear there were errors made," he said. "There will certainly be 
corrective action." 
</P>
<P>
 Under rules of engagement, allied warplanes are authorized to shoot down any 
aircraft flying inside the "no fly" zone that they identify as unauthorized to 
be there. They are also allowed to bomb Iraqi radar units that they determine 
are targeting allied aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the report said that the investigation cited these 
discrepancies as contributing to the tragedy: 
</P>
<P>
 * The transponders carried by the two helicopters to identify them as American 
were not programmed to transmit the proper coded signal, leading the F-15C 
pilots to believe that they were Soviet-built Iraqi Hinds, whose appearance is 
similar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contrary to usual procedures, the pilots of the two F-15Cs were not warned 
in advance that the U.S. helicopters were to be in the region. Instead, sources 
said, they were told that no "friendly" aircraft were scheduled to enter the 
"no fly" zone. 
</P>
<P>
 * While the F-15C pilots were routinely trained to recognize Iraqi aircraft at 
a glance, they had not been drilled on the shapes and characteristics of U.S. 
helicopters and mistook the U.S. pair -- both Army UH-60 Blackhawks -- for 
Iraqi aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 * The rules of engagement under which U.S. pilots were permitted to fire on 
suspected enemy aircraft in the northern "no fly" zone were not as rigorous as 
those in a similar "no fly" zone in southern Iraq -- making the system more 
vulnerable to errors, some critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry has taken steps to restrict the authority of U.S. fighter pilots to fire 
on aircraft in the northern zone. 
</P>
<P>
 He now must decide, as well, whether to discipline some of those involved, 
either by relieving them of duties or by subjecting them to courts-martial. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States narrowly escaped a similar tragedy last spring after Navy 
pilots in the southern Iraq "no fly" zone were given permission to fire on an 
unidentified plane but decided against it after their own observations did not 
track with AWACS information. The aircraft later turned out to be a Sudanese 
airliner. 
</P>
<P>
 The April 14 tragedy came as a major jolt to the military, which has become 
particularly sensitive to "friendly fire" accidents in which Americans are 
inadvertently killed by fire from U.S. troops. It occurred in daylight with 
good visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials confirmed that one of the F-15C pilots is Lt. Col. Randy May, who 
downed an Iraqi helicopter apparently carrying supplies to the front lines 
during the 1991 Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the report's contents amounted to confirmation of initial conclusions 
drawn by investigators on the day of the shooting.

 Sergei Novikov stood in the sun-drenched courtyard of Treatment and Labor 
Center No. 1, his home for eight of the last 12 years, waiting for freedom with 
nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'll do yet," said Novikov, a 39-year-old whose ruddiness, 
wrinkles and stoop make him look more like 60. "I'll get out there first, and 
then we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 Novikov is one of 11,000 alcoholics -- patients in official parlance, 
prisoners in practice -- being freed this week from 99 such institutions across 
Russia, which were ordered to empty out and shut down by this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treatment and Labor Centers were created in 1968 and at their peak held 
nearly 100,000 offenders, a figure that was down to 28,000 by March. They 
housed people considered alcoholics who committed crimes not serious enough to 
land them in prison -- anything from swearing in public to what officials call 
"household scandals." 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet authorities saw fit to lock them up, claiming that it was for their own 
good and that of society. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, less paternalistic Russia is setting them free. 
</P>
<P>
 The order to shut down came last July from the Supreme Soviet that President 
Boris N. Yeltsin disbanded three months later. The lawmakers opposed the idea 
of forced treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new Parliament has yet to set up an improved system of voluntary 
treatment, as promised, mainly because neither the Health Ministry nor the 
Interior Ministry wants to oversee it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, soaring crime has become such a problem in Russia that some 
officials now question the wisdom of closing the centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dozens of thousands of aggressive and dangerous alcoholics are being kicked 
out into the street and left on their own," said Anatoly Shevchenko, Health 
Ministry chief specialist on substance abuse. "It's paradoxical that this is 
being done at the same time that the president issues a decree to fight crime. 
What we will have is a great increase in street hooliganism, homelessness and 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the number of crimes committed under the influence of alcohol rose 
by 40% in the first quarter of 1994, when nearly 3,500 inmates were released 
from the centers. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a Moscow ambulance crew Wednesday found the body of a 2-year-old 
girl who had been starved to death by her alcoholic parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the men and women in the centers were there because relatives called 
the police when their drunken rages went too far. In many of those cases, the 
relatives now face revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why they say a person 'suffers from alcoholism,' " said Rudolf 
Volzhanin, chief of the Interior Ministry department responsible for the 
centers. "It is the wives and the children who suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the world is wary of the released drunks, the shuffling groups of men 
waiting for the metal gate to slide open at center No. 1 had similar qualms 
about life on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's chaos," said Vassily Mykalo, who said he did not set foot outside the 
drab brick complex during a year that gave Russia a violent coup attempt and 
threefold price rises. "It's changing so fast, it's wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Mykalo, 40, lacks two necessities for the outside world: a house and a job. A 
construction worker by trade, he will be hard put to find work with the 
reference to his time in the center in his "work booklet," an employment record 
required when applying for a job in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 And like a number of alcoholics in Russia, he "drank away" his Moscow 
apartment, selling it at a low price at a moment when the next bottle looked 
better than the roof over his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikolai Sheptalov, the gold-toothed director of center No. 1, keeps a portrait 
of Soviet dictator V. I. Lenin on his office wall -- a reminder of the system 
that ostensibly took care of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheptalov claimed that many of his 240 charges told him that they wanted to 
stay in the institution, where he said they were guaranteed three meals a day, 
a job with performance-related pay and a bed with a sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, according to the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I'm happy to be getting out," said Novikov. "I am a human being." 
</P>
<P>
 Happy, yes. Cured? No. While the system was supposed to keep alcoholics in 
remission, the real purpose was to keep them off the streets and out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "What treatment?" Mykalo scoffed. "What kind of treatment can there be in this 
dump?" 
</P>
<P>
 And Sheptalov admitted that some inmates drank with regularity during time off 
for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let one guy out to bury his mother," he recalled. "He never made it to her 
house, and we had to take care of the funeral arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
 For the newly freed, the future is less clear than the bottles of vodka and 
grain alcohol lining the windows of street kiosks in every Russian city. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those who seek help will have a hard time getting it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, the two hospitals that deal with alcoholics are overcrowded, and 
private treatment is expensive by Russian standards. Many won't even try to 
overcome their addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he will face his new life, Ivan Markin, a 59-year-old inmate at 
center No. 1, announced that first he planned to celebrate freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to go and get drunk," he said.

U.N. TO INVESTIGATE KILLINGS IN RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Security Council on Friday ordered an investigation of "acts of genocide" 
in Rwanda after U.N. human rights envoy Rene Degni-Segui called the tribal 
massacres there the largest in modern African history and said they were 
"planned and systematic." 
</P>
<P>
 In unanimously adopting a resolution to set up an investigating commission, 
the council laid to rest a diplomatic dispute about whether to evoke the 1950 
Geneva Convention on genocide to label the bloodletting in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed since April 6, mostly members 
of the minority Tutsi tribe slaughtered by government-trained Hutu militias. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will be formed by U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
and will issue its first findings in October. These could serve as evidence for 
prosecution of war criminals by an international tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 But no such court exists, and no steps were taken Friday to establish one, so 
any punishment of the killers and their leaders remains far off. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, along with other council members, was at first reluctant to 
label the Rwandan massacres "genocide," concerned that it might create binding 
legal obligations for the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Thursday that the violence was 
clearly genocide and that an international tribunal should be considered.

DIVIDED SENATE PANEL WRESTLES WITH HEALTH CARE BILL; CONGRESS: APPROVAL BY 
FINANCE COMMITTEE WILL SEND THE DEBATE TO ITS NEXT PHASE. THE FINAL VOTE IS 
EXPECTED TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bitterly divided Senate Finance Committee struggled on Friday night to pass 
a compromise health care reform plan, one that fails to meet President 
Clinton's demand for guaranteed coverage but nevertheless would shift the hot 
debate into a new phase as Congress breaks for its July 4 recess. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's progress was slowed by a series of Republican attempts to 
restrict abortion coverage in the bill, and it adjourned late Friday night 
without a final vote. The panel was scheduled to resume work this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional debate over abortion is sure to be revisited as the health care 
issue moves through both houses of Congress later this summer. In the words of 
Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), author of several of the anti-abortion 
amendments: "the whole enterprise (of health care reform) could founder on this 
subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Considered a bellwether panel for the full Senate, the Committee rejected by a 
11-9 vote a proposal by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) to bar abortion coverage 
in health plans except in the case of a life-threatening condition or if the 
pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the committee did adopt, 12 to 8, a Danforth amendment that says states 
would not be required to open abortion clinics in regions that have no doctors 
who perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same margin, the panel adopted a second Danforth amendment providing a 
"conscience clause" allowing employers to offer health plans without abortion 
coverage. In such cases, individual workers wishing to have abortion coverage 
would have to buy a supplemental policy, Danforth said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a separate issue, the committee voted to impose a limit of $250,000 as the 
most that any victim of medical malpractice may receive for non-economic 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, which earlier in the week had rejected any requirement that 
employers pay 80% of workers' insurance costs, also killed -- on a 13-7 vote -- 
a 1% payroll tax on employers with 500 or more workers, which would have been 
used to subsidize coverage for low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
 It also voted, 15 to 5, to kill a tax on handgun ammunition that would have 
helped pay for health care. Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) had 
proposed the tax.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee is expected to finish its work today, moving the focus of health 
care reform to the full House and Senate when Congress returns in mid-July. 
Three congressional panels have already approved varying versions of health 
care reform, and the next step is for House and Senate leaders to meld 
differing bills together before the issue is debated on the floors of the two 
chambers.  
</P>
<P>
 The White House and its Senate allies will seek to resurrect the key features 
of the President's plan that have been stripped by the Finance Committee, 
including the so-called employer mandate. Most lawmakers say they believe that 
universal coverage cannot be achieved if employers and/or individuals are not 
required to pay for insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter (what's in the bill)," said one top Administration 
official. "We'll do it on the floor." The Senate Labor and Human Resources 
Committee earlier passed a bill that contains many of Clinton's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, in a letter to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), hailed 
"a remarkable week . . . on health care" and noted that, when Congress returns, 
"we will have the opportunity to give the American people what they need and 
want, and to give the American economy what it needs -- guaranteed private 
insurance for every American." 
</P>
<P>
 The anticipated vote of approval by the Finance Committee will conclude the 
critical first phase of legislative action on health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Finance Committee will be the last committee to act on health 
care legislation, its endorsement is thought to be particularly influential 
because its membership is more representative of the various factions that must 
be brought together before any such measure can become law. 
</P>
<P>
 To the chagrin of some senators, however, the price of passing a bill before 
the July 4 recess was a breakdown of bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans said the final measure will be almost entirely the work of 
Democrats and is being "railroaded" to a final vote with little consideration 
for GOP amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sorry day for this committee," said Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.). 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) also complained about what he said 
was more than $200 billion in taxes over 10 years in the committee's bill, and 
he decried the rush to report out a bill before the July 4 deadline set by 
Democratic congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the way this committee does business," said Dole, who chaired the 
committee in the 1980s when the Senate was controlled by Republicans. "We spent 
more time on the B-2 bomber than on this bill." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) said committee members have sat through 
"countless meetings" and 31 formal sessions. "We've talked enough about health 
care to make us all sick," he said. "We know the issues. We know enough to make 
the best decisions that are humanly possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, a strong majority on the panel balked at imposing an 
employer mandate -- even as a fallback -- if other measures could not achieve 
virtually universal coverage. All nine Republicans and five Democrats joined to 
strike that provision -- proposed by Moynihan -- from a draft bill on a 14-6 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the panel voted, 12 to 8, for an approach advanced by a group of 
moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats that would set up a government 
commission to make recommendations for expanding coverage if 95% of all 
Americans did not have health insurance by the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill includes provisions aimed at making it difficult, but not impossible, 
for Congress to avoid voting on those recommendations or an alternative that it 
would select. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether this provision can be resurrected on the Senate floor is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Committee also voted for a provision, bitterly fought by organized 
labor, that would impose stiff taxes on health plans that are more costly than 
the average for their localities. The proposal, by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) 
would impose a 25% tax on high-cost plans, paid by the plans themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Friday, former independent presidential candidate Ross Perot confirmed 
reports that he intends to buy national television time for a program on health 
care to be produced by the Republican National Committee. He said that 
Americans "need more facts and less propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
 GOP National Chairman Haley Barbour said Perot and his supporters "hold 
similar views to those of the Republican Party on health care reform." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the GOP program would try to "advance the debate in a positive way." 
Dr. Bernadine Healy, former director of the National Institutes of Health and a 
recent unsuccessful Senate candidate in Ohio, will host the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual collaboration stems from Perot's and the GOP's dissatisfaction 
with Clinton's health care proposals. Both Perot and the Republican National 
Committee contend that Americans are not getting factual information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican Party wants an opportunity to explain health care to the 
American people. I have agreed to pay for this television time so the American 
people can have more balanced information," Perot said in a statement. "The 
program will provide an objective analysis of the health care system in this 
country and how to improve it."

JIM BAKKER ENTERS HALFWAY HOUSE AFTER SERVING 4 1/2 YEARS IN PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Bakker returned Friday to the state where his lucrative TV ministry began, 
arriving at a halfway house after 4 1/2 years in prison for defrauding 
investors out of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be back in the Carolinas, and I'm glad to be with my son today," 
said Bakker, who built his religious empire, Heritage USA, near Charlotte. "I'm 
excited to be anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by his teen-age son, Jamie, and his attorney, the former PTL 
leader arrived at a Salvation Army halfway house shortly after 11 a.m. He had 
left a minimum-security prison in Jesup, Ga., about seven hours earlier and 
flew to this city in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where he must stay until Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker, 53, was convicted in 1989 of defrauding thousands of his followers who 
sent him at least $1,000 each in return for promised lodging at Heritage USA 
for three days and four nights every year for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 During his trial, prosecutors said the scheme brought about $158 million into 
PTL from far more people than Heritage USA could accommodate. Rather than 
building promised hotels for his followers, Bakker spent their contributions to 
live in luxury himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker chatted for a few minutes Friday with reporters before going inside the 
one-story brick halfway house. Bakker will live with about 15 other men at the 
center and be driven to a job in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms, would not comment on reports that Bakker's job 
would be at his law office in nearby Hendersonville. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of a better place in the world for Jim Bakker to be than the 
Salvation Army," Toms said after bringing his client a turkey club sandwich and 
a slice of Key lime pie for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Bakker will live in the Hendersonville area until his father is released 
from the halfway house, Toms said.

N.Y. LEADERS MOVE TO SAVE HASIDIC SCHOOL REJECTED BY SUPREME COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The governor and legislative leaders agreed Friday on new laws aimed at 
keeping open a public school for disabled Hasidic students that was ruled 
unconstitutional this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday that the 1989 state law creating a special 
public school district for the handicapped youngsters of an Orthodox Jewish 
village in the Catskills violated the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Satmar Hasidic sect, which follows strict religious rules, operates its 
own parochial schools in the village of Kiryas Joel. But it wants the state to 
handle the more expensive job of instructing about 200 handicapped students. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers agreed Friday on a bill to allow that schooling to continue until a 
new district could be formed. Aides to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative 
leaders said a second bill could be passed soon to allow villages meeting 
specific criteria to create their own school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Grumet, executive director of the state School Boards Assn., said he 
believed that the criteria were so specific that only a handful of 
municipalities would apply -- and perhaps only Kiryas Joel. Grumet sued to have 
the 1989 law declared unconstitutional and said he would do so again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This statute is a sham, just like the last statute was a sham, the one that 
the Supreme Court struck down," he said. "I guess you could call it a son of 
sham." 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Crowley, Cuomo's press secretary, said state leaders believe that the 
bill passes constitutional muster. It is based on an approach suggested by 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in the high court's ruling, Crowley said.

GENERAL IN VITAMIN WARS BATTLES REGULATION WITH ZEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerald Kessler, founder of a dietary supplement company and a driving force 
behind the campaign to limit regulation of the industry, swears that there is 
"a worldwide conspiracy" to eliminate vitamins, minerals, amino acids and 
herbal products. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going on in every country," Kessler said. "It is the 
pharmaceutical-medical combine trying to make sure they are not being 
threatened worldwide by inexpensive, non-patented dietary supplements that will 
prevent the onset of chronic disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler, a 6-foot-7 man with a taste for the jugular, is executive director of 
the Nutritional Health Alliance, which represents supplement manufacturers, 
distributors and consumers. Organizers say the NHA has raised $750,000 from 
14,000 donors since it started in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry executives privately acknowledged that Kessler's zealotry and 
rhetorical excesses make them cringe. But he has made himself a major player in 
the high-profile battle to curtail the ability of the Food and Drug 
Administration and its congressional allies to regulate the $4-billion-a-year 
supplement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler has met often with FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler (no relation) and 
key members of Congress. He has crafted numerous mailings -- he estimates the 
alliance has put out 6 million to 7 million pieces -- giving consumers his 
highly charged view of the conflict and exhorting them to tell lawmakers to 
support industry-backed legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let the FDA take your supplements away!" screamed one flyer. "The FDA 
wants to expand the war on drugs to include nutritional supplements," said 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA officials and their supporters say Gerald Kessler is among those who have 
misled the public by claiming the agency intends to restrict access to these 
products. The FDA's real goal, they maintain, is to end deceptive, sometimes 
fraudulent, health claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler's detractors say he has more at risk in the regulatory debate than 
other mainstream supplement makers. These detractors say he has a major stake 
in a company that makes some products whose very names suggest implicit health 
claims. He denied that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler, 59, founded Nature's Plus, which sells about 350 supplement products, 
in the early 1970s. He retains controlling interest in its parent company, 
Natural Organics Inc., of Farmingdale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature's Plus products include the Immunizer Pak Program, a "powerful blend of 
ancient herbs (that is) a potent and effective immune booster formula," and 
Ultra Male, tablets containing dried bovine testes, prostate, liver, spleen and 
other body parts, along with Vitamin E and zinc. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature's Plus was one of four supplement companies charged with deceptive 
advertising last year by the New York City Consumer Affairs Department. The 
agency said the firms' product labels "prey on the fears and abuse the hopes of 
desperate people who have the AIDS virus." 
</P>
<P>
 The company was charged with violating the nation's only municipal law that 
makes it a deceptive trade practice to claim or imply that a product will 
improve the immune system, unless its labeling or advertising discloses its 
effect on a person who is HIV-positive, or states that it has not been proven 
to prevent or cure AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler said the Immunizer Pak is intended for healthy individuals "who would 
like to have their immune system functioning at peak performance," not for 
people who are HIV-positive or who have AIDS. He said the company has not 
stated this on the label because any mention of a disease -- even in a 
disclaimer -- would classify a product as a drug under the law. The company is 
seeking FDA approval to add such a warning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultra Male contains animal tissues that are purported to strengthen the same 
organs in humans, a type of product that has a long and controversial history. 
Kessler said that the marketing of Ultra Male involves no implied health claim 
-- such as boosting virility -- and stresses that it is intended simply "to 
support a male's needs nutritionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler said he retired as head of Natural Organics after assuming his NHA 
leadership role in 1992. But he is still listed as the parent company's chief 
executive by Standard & Poor's. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, he said, he is not driven by financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made money in real estate that is more than enough for me to live on very 
comfortably for the rest of my life," he said. "Anybody who really knows me 
knows I am not motivated by money. I am motivated by (the) principle . . . that 
people have freedom and people have a right to make choices in their own 
lives."

 State troopers will not have to be blasted with pepper spray now that the

<P>
 The Florida Highway Patrol suspended the policy Friday after the state Labor 
Department began investigating whether it posed a hazard to state troopers.The 
investigation was prompted by a complaint from the patrol's Lt. Harold Frear. 
</P>
<P>
 Frear's lawyer said patrol officials do not know the long-term effects of 
pepper spray, and troopers should not have to get blasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe people exposed to the spray should know what they're being exposed 
to," lawyer Ben Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The patrol began using pepper spray on its troopers this year as part of a 
program to train them how to use the weapon. During training, troopers are shot 
with the spray so they can feel its sting. 
</P>
<P>
 When sprayed into a victim's face, the chemical burns the skin and causes 
temporary blindness because the eyes can't be opened, Lt. Chuck Williams said.

RENO ASKS COURT TO APPOINT FISKE AS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno asked a federal appeals court Friday to appoint Robert 
B. Fiske Jr. as an independent counsel to continue his investigation of 
President Clinton's investments with the owner of a failed Arkansas thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno took the action a day after Clinton signed legislation reviving the 
independent counsel statute, which had lapsed for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Last January, Reno appointed Fiske as special counsel to probe the Whitewater 
and related investments of Clinton and his wife Hillary during Clinton's terms 
as Arkansas governor. But she had said repeatedly that it would be better for 
an independent panel of judges to appoint the person pursuing the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the statute passed by Congress this week, a special division of the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit appoints independent 
counsels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hereby request that the court appoint a statutory independent counsel as 
soon as possible, and that the court appoint Robert B. Fiske Jr., so that he 
may continue his ongoing investigation without disruption and with the full 
independence provided by the act," Reno wrote the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske "has not reported to the Department of Justice concerning his 
investigative results or the direction of his investigation," Reno added. She 
said the new independent counsel statute allows the court to choose Fiske. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) criticized Reno's action, saying Fiske was too 
closely tied to present and former Administration officials to be sufficiently 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Faircloth also called it "highly improper" for Reno to recommend Fiske's 
appointment. He said she should encourage the judges "to appoint a new, truly 
independent counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 The independent counsel statute provides only for criminal jurisdiction. Under 
his appointment by Reno, Fiske also had civil jurisdiction, the ability to file 
a civil suit against people or entities investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 If the court names someone else as independent counsel on the matter, Reno 
said she also would name that person "as an independent special attorney to 
handle all civil aspects of the investigation."

CONTROVERSIAL COMPROMISE HANDCUFFS CRIME BILL ACTION; CONGRESS: BLACK 
LAWMAKERS, CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, REMAIN AT ODDS OVER LANGUAGE OF 'RACIAL 
JUSTICE' MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is facing growing criticism of its inability to 
break an impasse over a controversial "racial justice" measure, which has 
paralyzed congressional action on the massive crime bill that the President had 
hoped to sign months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last several days, Administration officials have mounted a determined 
effort to broker a compromise with the Congressional Black Caucus over its 
demand to include the provision in the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would allow defendants in capital cases to challenge their 
sentences with statistics showing that the jurisdiction sentencing them had 
applied the death penalty proportionately more often to minorities than to 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Congress begins its July 4 recess, the Administration and the caucus 
have been unable to agree on language that the President could support -- and 
the continued delay is generating rising unease among supporters of the crime 
legislation, which would pump approximately $30 billion into cities and states 
over six years to hire police, build and operate prisons and fund new crime 
prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate's leading voice on crime legislation, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
(D-Del.), said Friday that President Clinton must either declare exactly what 
version of the racial justice measure he would accept, or publicly demand its 
removal from the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President has to say one of two things: 'This is what I am for' or 'I'm 
not for any of it and I want it out,' " Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), a leader of House moderates, said 
Friday: "At some point the Administration has to bring this process to closure. 
. . . This is a progressive bill and to have this (dispute) hold it up is just 
nonsensical." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Clinton has been unwilling to make a clear public statement of his 
preference on the bitterly divisive measure, which narrowly passed the House 
but is strongly opposed in the Senate. Instead, the White House has privately 
tried to set in motion a process that could lead to resolution of the dispute 
shortly after Congress returns from its recess. 
</P>
<P>
 At a private White House meeting last week, the Administration agreed to seek 
a compromise with the caucus that Clinton would endorse, according to several 
congressional and Administration sources. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the caucus and civil rights groups supporting the idea would be 
given about two weeks to generate support for the measure in the Senate, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Senate -- which voted, 58 to 41, against the idea in an advisory vote 
in May -- continued to resist, the supporters then would reassess, with the 
Administration's clear hope that they would agree to drop the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine going ahead if it is going to be defeated," said Rep. Don 
Edwards (D-San Jose), a principal sponsor of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal has snagged at the first step: finding language to narrow the 
measure on which the Administration and the caucus can agree. "It is still a 
subject of negotiation," said Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), the principal 
negotiator for the caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 But many inside and outside the Administration are increasingly doubtful that 
any compromise can be reached that Clinton would accept. As a result, they are 
hinting that Clinton may soon do what he has been unwilling to do so far: 
publicly indicate that he believes the racial justice provision should be 
dropped rather than risk sinking the entire bill, now stalled in a House-Senate 
conference committee.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's a judgment the President will make, and he is getting close to it," 
said one senior White House official. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few weeks, proponents have floated various compromises to narrow 
the racial justice measure. Among the ideas that have been discussed are 
stating directly that the bill would not require states to use racial quotas in 
applying the death penalty, permitting challenges only where defendants can 
prove a "pattern or practice" of racially discriminatory sentencing, and 
deleting explicit references to use of statistical evidence of alleged 
discrimination by defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 But groups representing prosecutors have rejected those ideas, insisting that 
they would not change the bill's basic dynamic. Critics note, for instance, 
that even if the bill dropped the explicit reference to the use of statistical 
evidence, such evidence is the most common way to prove "a pattern or practice" 
of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The long standoff over the racial justice provision has been wrapped in a fog 
of confusion and mixed signals. The single largest factor in the delay has been 
the Administration's hesitancy and caution as it seeks to avoid alienating 
liberal and minority supporters of the legislation without opening Clinton to 
attacks from Republicans and prosecutors' groups that the bill would 
essentially eliminate the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought they could get off the hook by having Congress make the decision 
for them and they wouldn't have to alienate anybody," McCurdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the long legislative proceedings, the Administration has rarely 
spoken with a clear voice, other participants in the negotiations said. "I 
think they are split," Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some Administration officials, as well as key political advisers, have 
been leery of signing onto any formulation of the racial justice provision -- 
which could leave Clinton open to GOP charges in 1996 of undercutting his 
support for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 But other voices, like senior adviser George Stephanopoulos, have seconded the 
insistence of the House Democratic leadership that Clinton must make every 
effort to avoid alienating the Black Caucus and other liberals -- whose votes 
the Administration will need in the fight over health care reform.  
</P>
<P>
 Looming over all these calculations, though, has been a conviction that senior 
Administration officials are only willing to voice privately: that there is no 
conceivable version of the racial justice provision that can attract the 60 
Senate votes needed to break a near-certain Republican filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House meeting last week, Biden and Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.) indicated that "it would be difficult to close to 
impossible," to pass any version through the upper chamber, said one source who 
was present. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than directly making that case to supporters of the racial justice 
measure, officials said the Administration has been hoping that they would 
finally come to the conclusion that the legislation cannot pass -- and 
voluntarily abandon it rather than risk losing other provisions in the bill 
that they support, such as the $9 billion in new crime prevention programs for 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials insisted that they are making a good-faith effort to 
find common ground on the racial justice provision that the Senate can accept. 
But some House supporters said they believe that the exercise amounts to a pro 
forma effort designed primarily to deflect blame from the Administration if the 
Senate continues to resist the measure.  
</P>
<P>
 "They are setting themselves up to say 'we couldn't sell it,' " said one 
senior House staff member. "They don't want to be the ones to say to the 
Congressional Black Caucus: 'You can't have what you want.' "

CRIMINAL CHARGES UNLIKELY IN TOBACCO INDUSTRY PROBE; HEALTH: EXPERTS SAY THE 
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND DIFFICULTY IN PROVING PERJURY MEAN THAT EXECUTIVES 
WILL ESCAPE PROSECUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department's investigation of the tobacco industry, the newest 
front in the government's assault on cigarette makers, almost certainly will 
not lead to criminal charges, according to department sources and legal 
experts.  
</P>
<P>
 Although an angry letter from seven congressmen that prompted the 
investigation alleges that tobacco executives "committed a series of serious 
crimes over a period of several decades," the federal statute of limitations 
bars prosecutions for acts dating back more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if more recent actions are found to be deceptive, specifically the 
congressional testimony of tobacco executives earlier this year, they are 
unlikely to amount to the perjury alleged in the letter, the sources and legal 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those legal limits, combined with the practical difficulty of pursuing 
decades-old cases involving retired or deceased tobacco industry figures, 
suggest that the seven signers of the letter overreached in their attempts to 
broaden what had already been a wide attack on tobacco by Congress and the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco company officials contend that the June 23 letter was a blatant grab 
for publicity and an attempt to further smear the industry. The letter, whose 
chief author was Rep. Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.), received extensive media 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan said that a Justice Department attorney and an FBI agent met with him 
last week shortly after Atty. Gen. Janet Reno told reporters that the 
government was looking into accusations in his letter. Reno said that officials 
of three divisions -- criminal, antitrust and civil -- were investigating 
aspects of the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked this week about the dim prospects for any criminal charges, Meehan said 
that he would be content if the Justice Department and FBI conducted a thorough 
criminal investigation and issued a report of their findings, even if no 
indictments are returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan said that a criminal division lawyer told him last week: "We are 
looking for a focus." A former state prosecutor before he entered Congress last 
year, Meehan responded by volunteering to write a "prosecution memo" outlining 
criminal charges, including perjury, that he thought might apply.  
</P>
<P>
 "They said they'd be happy to have me do that," the congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter and a subsequent interview this week, Meehan said that 
executives of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. "perjured themselves" earlier 
this year when they testified before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee 
on health and the environment that they did not know nicotine was addictive.  
</P>
<P>
 Internal documents that have come to light from B&W, the third largest U.S. 
tobacco firm, "flatly contradict" that claim, according to Meehan's letter. The 
congressman also cited testimony by former scientists for Philip Morris who 
said that research in the 1980s showed nicotine was highly addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco officials strongly deny that they have sought to deceive Congress or 
the public, and former Atty. Gen. Griffin B. Bell, representing an industry 
executive, has belittled the idea of a criminal investigation on grounds that 
executives were only expressing opinions about the relative health hazards of 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never heard of perjury based on giving an opinion," Bell said. "We don't 
put folks in jail for that, so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Meehan's letter refers to testimony before a subcommittee headed by 
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), Waxman declined to join in the letter, 
even though he is a leading Capitol Hill foe of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee is in the midst of its own investigation of the tobacco 
industry, and congressional sources said that Waxman believes a competing 
inquiry by Justice might interfere with his own investigation or be premature. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department sources said that perjury charges are limited to testimony 
that is a clear-cut denial or contradiction of facts clearly known by the 
witness and where the motivation is to conceal criminal activity or to further 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to get tobacco executives hauled off to jail," Meehan 
declared. "But their assertion that nicotine is not addictive is outrageous. We 
need to hold their feet to the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that the Justice Department antitrust and civil divisions, 
pursuing inquiries that began before Meehan's letter, are looking into whether 
some companies colluded to suppress scientific research into less hazardous 
cigarettes and whether cigarette labeling accurately reflects nicotine content.

WATER OFFICIAL PLEADS GUILTY TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Closing out a scandal that prompted an overhaul of the Santa Margarita Water 
District, the district's former second-in-command pleaded guilty Thursday to 
criminal charges that he illegally influenced the award of contracts to 
companies that lavished him with gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilty pleas by Michael P. Lord, who was assistant general manager for 
nearly 16 years until his retirement in 1993, end a criminal investigation that 
began 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, 51, agreed to pay a $10,000 fine and perform 320 hours of community 
service after pleading guilty to 15 counts of conflict of interest and failing 
to disclose gifts. Lord is in the midst of Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings and 
was given until the end of the year to pay his fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing nervous and subdued in Municipal Court on Thursday, Lord said he 
understood that he is not to be involved with any water district in Orange 
County, including Santa Margarita, for the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 He also agreed not to lobby on behalf of any county, state or local agency for 
the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, whose bankruptcy filing in San Diego County claims assets of $375,646 
and liabilities of $416,257, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two weeks, three other officials have agreed to pay fines for 
similar conflicts of interest, and for their failure to fully disclose on their 
annual statements of economic interest, as state law requires, the gifts they 
had accepted from district contractors.

3 TRIBES ALLOWED TO KEEP VIDEO SLOT MACHINES UNTIL COURT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three area Indian tribes have struck an unprecedented deal with the U.S. 
attorney here, allowing them to keep controversial slot-style gambling machines 
for now if they agree to hand them over if a court rules against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribes pledged not to expand their casinos without approval from the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, U.S. Atty. Alan Bersin promised not to confiscate the tribes' 
electronic gaming devices, which resemble slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
 California officials consider the devices illegal. And they were leery of the 
deal worked out Thursday between the tribes and Bersin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state's position is clear. You have to have (permission) from the state 
to offer video gambling," said the state attorney general's spokesman Dave 
Puglia. "The Supreme Court has affirmed that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement described doesn't seem consistent with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The pacts were struck with the Barona, Viejas and Sycuan reservations in San 
Diego County, all of which offer Las Vegas-style video gaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the tribes are subject to conflicting federal and state 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Court decisions have said clearly that tribes need state permission to offer 
Las Vegas-style gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 California officials have refused to grant that permission or to discuss the 
issue, even though courts have ordered the state to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, courts have ruled that only federal authorities can regulate 
or police Indian gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Several conflicting decisions surrounding the issue are now being appealed. 
Rulings in the next six months could clarify the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bersin said Gov. Pete Wilson, who strongly opposes Indian gambling, should 
welcome the deal because it puts the tribes on record as agreeing to remove 
their machines if they lose in court. 
</P>
<P>
 By freezing operations, the deal also lays the groundwork for removing the 
machines if courts rule against the Indians, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's tribal casinos have about 2,000 of the machines. They have proved 
a cash cow for the once poverty-stricken tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal leaders, almost gleeful at Bersin's appearance on their reservations 
Thursday, called the deal a watershed in Indian-government relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "No U.S. attorney has ever come here before," said Anthony Pico, chairman of 
the Viejas band of Mission Indians.

LAST 2 YOUTHS CONVICTED IN MURDER OF STUDENT; COURTS: STUART A. TAY WAS KILLED 
AFTER TEEN-AGERS IN PLOT TO STEAL COMPUTER EQUIPMENT FEARED HE WOULD BETRAY 
THEM. THREE OTHERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SENTENCED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Orange County teen-agers were found guilty Friday of first-degree murder 
in the 1992 New Year's Eve killing of a 17-year-old honors student who was 
bludgeoned and buried in a back-yard grave in a case that gained nationwide 
attention as a troubling portrait of youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirn Kim, 18, and Abraham Acosta, 17, were the last of five youths convicted 
in the killing of Stuart A. Tay, a high school student from Orange who aspired 
to be a doctor like his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim acted as lookout while the others lured Tay to the back yard of Acosta's 
Buena Park home. Acosta leveled the first of many blows to Tay's body with a 
baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
 The five teen-agers, most of them college-bound students at Sunny Hills High 
School in Fullerton, wanted Tay dead because they believed he was about to 
double-cross them in a planned theft of computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said Friday that the case left them emotionally drained, and they 
expressed concern for the families of Tay and the five assailants who were 
caught up in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very difficult case for all of us," jury forewoman Wilma Johnson 
said. "Our sympathies and hearts go out to all the members of all the families 
on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of lives hurt," said juror Jennifer Baker, who wept as the 
verdicts were read. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim closed his eyes tight and blinked several times as the jury announced the 
guilty verdict that could send him to prison for 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta sat quietly at the defense table until Orange County Superior Court 
Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary began discussing sentencing. That's when Acosta broke 
down, sobbing loudly as defense attorney Denise Gragg put a comforting arm 
around his shoulder. The judge ordered the courtroom cleared of spectators, but 
Acosta's cries could still be heard in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to convicting both youths of first-degree murder, jurors found 
Acosta guilty of ambushing his victim -- a special circumstance finding that 
means he faces the prospect of life in prison without the possibility of 
parole. But they rejected a second special circumstance charge that the killing 
had been for financial gain because he took $100 from Tay's wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also acquitted Kim of the special circumstance allegation that he 
ambushed his victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution said Kim and Acosta joined in plotting the killing, joining a 
dress rehearsal with their friends, helping dig the grave in advance and 
agreeing to dump the victim's car in Compton to make the killing look like a 
carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay, a student at Foothill High School in Santa Ana, was beaten in Acosta's 
garage with bats and a sledgehammer. When he did not die immediately, the 
youths forced him to drink rubbing alcohol and taped his nose and mouth shut 
before he was buried in a shallow grave that had been dug 24 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Tay, the victim's mother, said outside of court Friday that she is not 
fully satisfied by the verdicts. She said she could not understand why jurors 
did not conclude that Kim was guilty of lying in wait for the victim or why 
Acosta was not convicted of killing for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know he did dig the grave the day before," Linda Tay said of Kim. 
"Certainly, it was well planned ahead of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The sophisticated murder scheme and the sheer senselessness of the killing 
grabbed headlines from the start. But the case also shocked Orange County 
because the assailants and the victim were such unlikely suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them did well in school. The teen-agers spent their time cruising 
fast-food restaurants, doing homework and playing computer games. 
</P>
<P>
 The ringleader was Robert Chan, 19, of Fullerton, a onetime candidate for 
valedictorian, who was convicted in a separate trial in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay was a high-achieving honors student. But he also had another side, one 
that was intrigued with crime and gangs and liked to brag about involvement in 
spy networks and underworld activities. The talk was designed to impress those 
around him; there was no evidence that Tay was involved in criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay assumed an alias and said he was much older when he sought out Chan. The 
two hatched a plan to rob an Anaheim computer parts dealer and recruited the 
four remaining teen-agers to carry out the scheme, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chan discovered Tay was lying about his age and name, Chan decided to 
kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness was Charles Choe, 18, of Fullerton, who pleaded 
guilty to first-degree murder for his role in the attack. In return for his 
testimony against his former co-defendants, Choe was prosecuted as a juvenile. 
The other teens were prosecuted as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum told jurors the five teens were all 
fully involved with planning and carrying out the murder scheme. But defense 
attorneys for Kim and Acosta had argued to jurors that Chan duped their clients 
into participating in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Gragg presented evidence that Acosta is a mentally 
disabled youth who was easily led to believe that he was to strike Tay as part 
of a prank to scare the victim. The blow did little more than anger Tay, who 
was then knocked unconscious when Chan took over the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Allan H. Stokke told jurors that Kim also was unaware a 
murder was occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta's mother avoided reporters after Friday's hearing. Sook Kim, Kirn Kim's 
mother, told reporters that she and her son pray daily for Stuart Tay and his 
family, but said Robert Chan is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a victim of Robert Chan," she said of her son. "The only thing 
different is he is alive. We will be praying for Stuart Tay and (his) family 
for the rest of our lives."

 A fireworks stall exploded Friday at an outdoor antique market in downtown 
Vitoria, in southeastern Brazil, killing as many as 30 people and injuring more 
than 40, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing cars flipped over, trees were flattened, and flaming debris and tin 
roofs flew through the air, fire officials said. The market was jammed with 
about 250 shoppers.

WILSON'S OFFICE AGAINST PRICE-GOUGING BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raising the ire of consumer advocates, the Wilson Administration has announced 
its opposition to a bill that would outlaw the type of widespread price gouging 
that occurred after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, passed by the Assembly, would limit price increases on essential 
goods and services to 10% in the wake of a natural disaster such as an 
earthquake or wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state Department of Consumer Affairs says it wants the legislation 
diluted so businesses can raise prices by 50% immediately after such 
calamities. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also wants the bill's author, Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), to reduce proposed fines for price gouging from $10,000 to $1,000. 
And it wants Katz to remove language calling for immediate revocation of a 
contractor's license if he or she is convicted of price gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is not that we support price gouging, because we certainly don't," 
said Traci Stevens, the department's deputy director for legislation. "But it's 
also a small-business issue. Placing caps on prices is a sensitive thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't do anyone any good if small businesses are forced to shut down 
because you can't raise prices to pay for reconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said Gov. Pete Wilson's office supports the department's position on 
the bill. "In order for us to have an approved position, it has to go through 
the governor's office," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's stance on the bill, which sailed through the Assembly in 
June and is scheduled for a Senate hearing Tuesday, provoked charges by the 
Consumers Union that business interests were getting more protection than 
consumer concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's just outrageous," said Gail Hillebrand of Consumers Union, 
publisher of Consumer Reports. "The Wilson Administration's consumer protection 
agency has declared that businesses in 'state of emergency' areas should be 
allowed to gouge consumers by up to 50%." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong legislation is needed, Hillebrand said, because "California needs to 
send a message to businesses that you can't take advantage of consumers at the 
very vulnerable time after a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz introduced the bill amid a flood of complaints after the Jan. 17 quake 
that some merchants were charging inflated prices for services and such 
essential goods as gasoline, batteries, water and building supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, a liter of water went for $12.15, a foot of pipe for $850 
and a $1.59 pack of batteries sold for $10. Some contractors were overcharging 
for everything from utility hookups to plywood. The Los Angeles County 
Department of Consumer Affairs recorded 1,460 complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Katz said he may compromise on the issue of automatic revocation of 
contractors' licenses -- allowing the Contractors State Licensing Board to 
determine discipline on a case-by-case basis -- he says he will not back down 
on the 10% price hike cap or the $10,000 proposed fines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe that a department called 'consumer affairs' would come 
out and say: 'You ought to be able to raise prices,' " Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen some bizarre positions by state agencies before, but from an 
election year standpoint, this is not only bad policy, it's bad politics," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens denied that the department favored businesses over consumers. "We are 
trying to achieve a balance here that's appropriate for adequate consumer 
protection and maintaining small business, too," she said.

COURT VOIDS PARENTAL CONSENT ABORTION LAW; RULING: APPELLATE JUSTICES SAY 1987 
MEASURE CALLING FOR A MINOR TO GET APPROVAL VIOLATES THE STATE CONSTITUTION. 
LAW HAS NOT BEEN ENFORCED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial law requiring minors to obtain parental or judicial consent 
for an abortion was declared unconstitutional Friday by a state appellate court 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-justice panel said the law -- passed by the Legislature in 1987 but 
never enforced because of legal challenges -- violates a minor's right to 
privacy under the California Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the state argued that girls under age 18 are unable to make 
informed decisions about pregnancy, making them vulnerable to serious medical, 
emotional or psychological harm from an abortion. The law, they argued, is a 
justifiable governmental attempt to protect teen-agers and strengthen the 
parent-child relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 1st District Court of Appeal -- in a 3-0 ruling written by Justice 
William Stein -- concluded that the law would do nothing of the sort and might 
in fact damage the well-being of minors and family harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 The law "forces the minor to divulge her procreative choice against her 
wishes," Stein wrote. "In addition, a minor who cannot or will not obtain 
parental consent is required to divulge a highly intimate choice to a complete 
stranger (a judge) . . . in an extremely stressful proceeding." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Stein added, "this legislation creates the possibility that a minor 
will be compelled to bear a child against her wishes. It would be hard to 
imagine a more egregious breach of social norms." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ruling was the latest twist in a widely watched test of the state's 
ability to regulate abortion. A spokesman for Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren expressed 
disappointment with the decision and said there would be an appeal to the state 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an issue important to California and it should be considered by the 
state's highest court," said spokesman Dave Puglia. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires unwed minors to get parental approval -- or the consent of a 
Juvenile Court -- before obtaining an abortion. It would affect about 30,000 
unmarried adolescents who have abortions each year in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent surveys show that 25 states enforce similar laws. Before California's 
could take effect in 1988, a coalition of health and family planning groups 
filed suit, contending that the restriction infringed on a minor's right to 
reproductive choice. A series of court injunctions have barred the law's 
enforcement ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a San Francisco Superior Court judge declared the law 
unconstitutional after hearing a month of testimony from medical and family 
planning experts and researchers who had investigated the effect of laws in 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's ruling, the appellate court said testimony had supported the 
judge's finding. For two decades, Stein noted, minors have been undergoing 
abortions without parental involvement -- with no apparent negative effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Minors, he wrote, "are at no special psychological or emotional risk from 
abortion and, indeed, are less likely than adults to experience any adverse . . 
. reaction to the procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the law praised the court for a ruling they called thoughtful and 
in the best interest of California's young women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very gratifying to see a court actually look at the evidence and tell 
the Legislature it can't justify this kind of invasion of privacy on the basis 
of this proof," said attorney Linda Shostak, who represents the coalition of 
groups challenging the law. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those groups -- the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
-- said the court had taken "a very positive step to ensure that vulnerable 
young women have continued access to reproductive health services."

STRAY BULLET CLAIMS LIFE OF WATTS MATRIARCH; CRIME: 80-YEAR-OLD 'GRANDMOTHER TO 
NEIGHBORHOOD' IS SHOT WHILE WASHING DISHES. HER HOME, WHICH WAS A PLACE FOR 
EVERYONE TO GATHER, NOW IS A PLACE FOR MOURNING.

<P>
 Everyone knew May Dunkentall. In fact, Dunkentall's daughter, LucilleBritt, 
believes even the people who killed her 80-year-old mother may have known her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knew all of these people in the area, from Alameda to Wilmington, from 
92nd Street down," Britt said. "She knew all these people who've been here in 
this yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Those people knew they could come to Dunkentall's Watts house to sit on her 
porch and sample her food. They knew her as "Gramps" or "Big Mamma," the 
frequent hostess of birthday parties and neighborhood gatherings.  
</P>
<P>
 Now her home is a site for mourning. Family, friends and neighbors assembled 
outside the 107th Street residence Friday to grieve for Dunkentall, who was hit 
by a stray bullet from a passing vehicle as she washed dishes in her kitchen 
Thursday night. She died that evening at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Page, a neighbor, said he rushed into the house when he heard the shots 
and found Dunkentall lying in a pool of blood by her refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever is responsible, I hope they get their just rewards," he said. "I hope 
they meet the same thing she did. I hope they meet pain and death the way she 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't have to die like this," said Susan Clark, who has lived near 
Dunkentall for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 For 29 years, Dunkentall has been a fixture in the neighborhood. She brought 
up her daughter and two sons on a plantation in Shreveport, La., before moving 
the family to Los Angeles in the mid-1960s "to do better," in Britt's words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loved Mrs. Dunkentall," Page said. "She's a legend. She's part of 
this community." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was like a grandmother to me," said Mike Johnson, 24. Indeed, many say 
Dunkentall, who took care of seven grandchildren of her own, was a grandmother 
to the whole neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She would sit on her porch and feed anyone who came by and wanted food, 
neighbors say. She would wake up in the mornings and begin cooking soul food, 
serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Passersby would hail from the street: 
"Hey, Gramps!" 
</P>
<P>
 "This place was like a second home," said Michael, a neighbor who would only 
give his first name. "She'd feed you. She might know you were on drugs, she 
wouldn't give you money, but she'd feed you." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael, 33, said he used to sell pots and pans when he was younger, and 
Dunkentall would always buy one. "She didn't need them, but she'd buy them," he 
said. "She was like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dunkentall was also a no-nonsense woman, Britt said. "She was just down to 
earth. She didn't pull any punches, she called a spade a spade," she said. 
"That's why the kids loved her." 
</P>
<P>
 When Dunkentall thought someone had stepped out of line, she was sure to let 
them know. "She would sock all of us," Britt said. "I'm 51 and she would hit 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "She taught me to respect all grown-ups, be they white, black or brown," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt's 22-year-old daughter, Denise, learned similar lessons. "She told me to 
stay out of trouble," she said. "I'm just going to miss her. She was a good 
lady, a good grandma." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkentall never changed during her 29 years in Watts, her daughter says, but 
the neighborhood did. The streets became more dangerous. Stray bullets flew. 
One blinded Dunkentall's youngest son, Virgil. Then, in 1977, Dunkentall's 
other son, Charles, was killed by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dunkentall "never thought about moving," her daughter said. "She didn't 
have any fear, OK, of stuff like this." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day there was someone here with her," Britt said. But no one else was 
home Thursday night. The other resident, Dunkentall's 22-year-old grandson 
Keith Dunkentall, was out when the shooting occurred. Britt said she did not 
know if the drivers had been after Keith. Police, who are continuing an 
investigation, said they have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Britt is leaving the neighborhood her mother loved. She says she is taking 
her family back to Louisiana, where her mother will be buried. "I lost my 
mother, my brother, and my baby brother was shot and blinded," Britt said.  
</P>
<P>
 And is she now worried for Keith Dunkentall? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Britt said, clutching a framed picture of her mother to her chest. "My 
worries stopped yesterday. I was always worried about my mother. God has her 
now, so I don't have to worry anymore."

WOMAN IS CONVICTED OF PLOTTING 2 MURDERS; CRIME: MARY ELLEN SAMUELS, DUBBED 
'GREEN WIDOW' FOR HER LAVISH SPENDING HABITS, COULD RECEIVE DEATH PENALTY FOR 
ARRANGING SLAYINGS OF HER HUSBAND AND HIS KILLER. 
</P>

<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels, dubbed the "green widow" because she spent the $500,000 
she inherited from her slain husband at a dizzying pace, was convicted Friday 
of two counts of first-degree murder for arranging his death and that of his 
executioner seven months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, who had denied from the witness stand that she was involved in either 
killing, leaned heavily against defense attorney Phil Nameth but showed no 
other visible reaction as the jury returned the verdicts, reached after 18 days 
of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the investigating officer, who spent the final years of his career 
building the case against Samuels, broke down and cried. Sitting just a few 
feet away from the defendant, her former sister-in-law Susan Conroy also wept. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what people say about black widows? Well, she's a green widow. It's 
the same thing as a black widow, which eats its mate when he's no longer useful 
to her," retired Los Angeles Police Detective George Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very cunning predator," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is to return to court July 11 to determine whether Samuels, 45, 
should receive the death penalty or receive a sentence of life in prison for 
the murders of Robert Samuels, 45, a Hollywood camera operator's assistant, and 
James R. Bernstein, 27, a reputed drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the murder convictions -- which included the special circumstances of 
multiple killings and murder for financial gain -- the jury convicted Samuels 
of two counts of conspiracy and two counts of solicitation of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 During the lengthy trial, which unfolded like a pulp novel, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jan Maurizi alleged that Samuels plotted to have her estranged husband killed 
when she realized "he was worth more to her dead than alive." 
</P>
<P>
 As a divorcee, Samuels would have received a settlement of about $30,000. But 
as a widow, she inherited $500,000. She spent nearly all the money during the 
13 months she was under investigation -- on a Porsche, a Cancun condo, a 
country club birthday bash, rented limousines, fake fur coats, trips to Las 
Vegas, and custom-made outfits from a store called Trashy Lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she did not pay for her husband's headstone, defaulted on her mortgage, 
and failed to pay debts rung up by the family's Sherman Oaks sandwich shop, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the prosecution witnesses once were among Samuels' closest 
confidantes. They described Samuels' search for a hit man and several botched 
attempts on her husband's life. Some of the former friends testified under 
grants of immunity from prosecution for their roles in the murder schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney suggested that Samuels was framed by an overzealous police 
detective and "fair-weather friends" who accused her to spare themselves from 
prosecution for their roles in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, who worked on the films "Lethal Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," 
was ambushed in his Northridge home on Dec. 8, 1988, by an intruder who hit him 
over the head, then shot him with a 16-gauge shotgun, firing through a pillow. 
Samuels and her daughter, Nicole, then 18, who were living in Reseda at the 
time, told police they discovered the body when they dropped off a pet 
schnauzer for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, who carried a business card identifying himself as a "specialist," 
was strangled on June 27, 1989, and his body was dumped in Lockwood Canyon in 
Ventura County. According to testimony, the killers drove Samuels' black Toyota 
Celica convertible. The letters on the car's vanity tags were NAST VXN for 
"nasty vixen," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The confessed killers, Paul Edwin Gaul and Darrell Ray Edwards, testified for 
the prosecution under plea bargains. Both pleaded guilty to second-degree 
murder and received sentences of 15 years to life in prison. Gaul testified 
that he drank 30 to 40 beers the day they killed Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The witnesses painted an unflattering portrait of Samuels, describing her as a 
crass woman who hired male strippers for her daughter's 18th birthday and 
flirted with police the night she discovered her husband's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like bald guys," she told one detective, rubbing his hairless head, 
according to testimony. Later, she was not so friendly toward police. Several 
witnesses testified that she taught a pet parrot to say profane things about 
the now retired detective, Daley.

 A Val Verde real estate agent abducted Wednesday was found tied up in an 
Arizona motel room Friday morning after a maid heard her cries and summoned 
help, witnesses and authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Harrington, 26, disappeared after showing several homes in the small 
Santa Clarita Valley community to an unidentified male customer Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 She was locked in Room 8 of the El Coronado Motel in Gila Bend about 10 a.m. 
when she was discovered tied up and fully clothed on the bed, said motel 
manager Vinaykent Patel. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said: 'I'm tied up and I can't open the door, call the police,' " said 
Patel, who was brought to the room by a maid who heard the woman's cries. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, the kidnaper called Harrington's office to reveal where 
she was, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The abductor, described as white and in his 40s, is still at large, 
authorities said. He left the motel before Harrington was discovered, Patel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Callahan, an FBI spokesman, said late Friday that Harrington had been 
assaulted. The FBI was investigating the case because the kidnaper crossed the 
state line. 
</P>
<P>
 DeAnne Tippetts, owner of the Century 21 office near Santa Clarita where 
Harrington worked, said she accepted a collect call about 10:30 a.m. Friday 
from a man who did not identify himself. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the man told her Harrington was unharmed in a motel room in Gila 
Bend, a town of 1,747 people about 70 miles southwest of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just in shock," Tippetts said. "I hoped it was real and I was elated at 
the thought she might be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 The call was brief and the man spoke calmly, trying to make sure she got the 
location right, Tippetts added. 
</P>
<P>
 Tippetts said she called 911, and Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
alerted other authorities. Harrington was taken to a Phoenix hospital for 
observation and questioning by police, said relatives of Harrington who had 
flown to Arizona to be with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington's husband, Chris, who also flew to Arizona on Friday afternoon said 
he expects her to be able to return home today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm overwhelmed, ecstatic, grateful -- everything rolled up into one," he 
said in an impromptu news conference on the porch of his home shortly after 
learning his wife was safe Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he spoke to her briefly on the phone and that she seemed to be in 
good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not discuss in detail what had happened, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Val Verde, population 1,500, were thrilled that Harrington had 
been found. Many had helped search for her in the hills surrounding their 
community, which is about 10 miles northwest of Santa Clarita. They also 
distributed tens of thousands of flyers nationally asking for help in locating 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping began about 2 p.m. Wednesday when a man walked into Harrington's 
office, asking to look at homes in Val Verde. Several employees were on duty at 
the time and he did not ask specifically for Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 They drove to the houses in the man's teal Jeep Cherokee. Police officials 
said they believe the pair visited "four or five" homes because Harrington's 
business cards were found there. 
</P>
<P>
 A co-worker of Harrington grew suspicious when Harrington did not return after 
about 2 1/2 hours, and she went to look for her. She spotted what she believed 
was the man's Jeep at a home about 4:30 p.m. and, feeling something was wrong, 
wrote down the license plate number and called for help from a nearby house. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jeep was gone when the co-worker returned. Investigators discovered that 
the license plates on the vehicle had been stolen from a car in Pismo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington made an ATM withdrawal of $300 from a Bank of America branch in 
Hacienda Heights at 8:34 p.m. Wednesday, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. 
Donald Bear. A photo from the bank camera showing her head and shoulders did 
not reveal anyone in back of or to the side of her, and she did not appear to 
be under duress.

UNIONS SUE OVER SHIFT OF DWP REVENUES; BUDGET: CITY ELECTRICAL WORKERS AND 
ENGINEERS FILE LEGAL ACTION, SAYING THE TRANSFER TO COVER POLICE COSTS WILL USE 
UP MONEY NEEDED FOR REPAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Los Angeles city unions filed a lawsuit Friday against Mayor Richard 
Riordan and the Los Angeles City Council in an attempt to block a financial 
transfer that is central to the city's plan to pay for a larger police force. 
</P>
<P>
 The unions charged in their suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, that 
the shift of nearly $200 million from the Department of Water and Power to the 
city treasury will prevent the city-owned utility from properly maintaining its 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 18, and the 
Engineers and Architects Assn. alleged in the lawsuit that the $197-million 
transfer violates the City Charter, which only permits the shift of surplus 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, the DWP has transferred about 5% of its gross revenues to 
the city. But Riordan's budget, approved by the City Council, transfers an 
additional $75 million in the fiscal year that began Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra money is almost enough to pay for the $83-million first-year cost of 
the mayor's police expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brian D'Arcy, business manager of the electrical workers union, said the 
transfer leaves too little for the DWP to maintain water and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are acting like bagmen when their obligation is to distribute 
water and power at reasonable rates," D'Arcy said. "We are not here just to 
accomplish the mayor's political agenda. They don't seem to get that." 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers and electrical workers are threatened with substantial job 
losses under a recently released audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was out of town and could not be reached for comment. But his legal 
counsel, Karen Rotschafer, said she did not think the lawsuit will prevent or 
delay the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always held that what we are doing is perfectly legal under the City 
Charter," Rotschafer said. "We feel the city is able to receive surplus funds 
and we have identified those funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the extra money that DWP managers proposed transferring is to come 
from the sale of surplus fuel oil and property. The oil was to be used to 
generate electricity in emergencies, but engineers say they now have backup 
natural gas supplies. A variety of properties might be sold by the DWP, the 
largest publicly owned utility in the nation, including former reservoir and 
power plant sites. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP managers who had committed to the larger transfer when the budget was 
drafted in April had begun to cast doubt in recent weeks about whether the 
sales would produce $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Miyoshi, the utility's chief, said last month that he might be able to 
deliver as little as half of that amount. When two of Riordan's appointees on 
the DWP commission tried to guarantee at least $10 million of the transfer 
immediately, Miyoshi and others balked. They said that taking the money could 
cut into repairs and the replacement of antiquated water mains. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Arcy conceded that the unions might not be able to block the entire 
transfer. But "what we are asking is for somebody to explain where they are 
going to get this money," he said.

HOTFOOTING IT OUT OF L.A. FOR THE WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spurred by oven-like heat this week, Los Angeles residents got out of town 
with a vengeance Friday in search of a cooler climate for the long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know where I'm going and I don't much care, just so it's not 
hot," said Margaret Simeon, 26, who was shopping for a bathing suit at an 
Encino sporting goods store. "You know those commercials, 'You deserve a 
break'? That's me." 
</P>
<P>
 As early as Friday morning, cars and minivans stuffed with camping gear and 
people wearing shorts and sandals shared freeways with office-bound commuters 
who had not been able to sneak away yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacation plans of the Kaylor family, which was heading south on the Golden 
State Freeway near Castaic, were apparent from the sleeping bags, lawn chairs, 
card tables and two aqua Big Wheels bikes piled precariously in their white 
pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kind of looks like the Beverly Hillbillies, huh?" said Ken Kaylor, a resident 
of Lake Hughes in the hot High Desert region. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last week, the contractor had been working outdoors in the Antelope 
Valley, getting singed each day by an unrelenting sun. On Friday, he took the 
day off to drive his family to a Ventura beach campground, where all were 
hoping for cloudy skies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had reservations for the July Fourth weekend about three months ago, and 
it worked out about perfect," Kaylor said. "It's going to be overcast and cool. 
Eighty-degree weather is going to be a lot cooler than 115." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters say the weekend weather in Los Angeles -- even in the inland San 
Fernando, San Gabriel, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys -- should be cooler, 
though not necessarily cool.  
</P>
<P>
 "The marine layer has finally kicked in, so it won't be as warm," said Curtis 
Brack, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The 
Times. "But the valley areas will still be pretty warm." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures will hover around the mid-90s in the valleys, and the 80s in 
Downtown Los Angeles. Hot, yes, Brack said, but a lot better than earlier this 
week, when Southern California boiled through seven days of 100-degree-plus 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're getting back toward more normal temperatures for this time of 
year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacationers and day-trippers seeking cooler spots, as usual, will be best off 
heading into the mountains or along the coast, where highs will hit only the 
60s and 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 While Caltrans expects the usual heavy traffic on local freeways and roads to 
the beach this weekend, the only major problem they predict will be on the 
southbound Golden State Freeway between Wheeler Ridge and Ft. Tejon, where two 
lanes will be closed for shoulder repairs. That project could particularly 
affect the return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closed lanes will probably impact people heading back into L.A.," 
Caltrans spokesman Russ Snyder said. "So we are advising people to return a 
little earlier than usual to avoid the rush." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst times for traveling, Snyder said, will be Sunday and Monday evenings 
between 4 and 8. He said traffic also could back up at the interchange of the 
Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways where crews continue to repair 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, many people were trying for an early jump on the exit traffic -- 
some more successfully than others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was all packed up and ready to hit the road for a little fishing, when I 
forgot something pretty important," said Gary Vincent, a 40-year-old from 
Culver City who had stopped to buy supplies on his way out of town. "Yeah, I 
forgot my fishing gear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not the only one lacking the necessary equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the busiest rental time of year for us," said Rob Henderson, store 
manager at REI, a Northridge camping gear store. "People are making a run for 
the insect repellent, picking up last minute stuff and getting out of Dodge." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Forest Service official warned prospective campers that if they had not 
already gotten to their favorite campground or reserved a spot by this morning, 
they probably would not get one this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "On holiday weekends, we just don't have enough sites to meet the demand," 
said Bob Libershal, a fire prevention officer with the Forest Service at the 
Monte Christo campgrounds in the Angeles National Forest.  
</P>

staff writer Phil Sneiderman also contributed to this story.

PET LOST IN JET ELUDES SEARCHERS IN A GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pet cat lost in a jetliner's cargo bay at Los Angeles International Airport 
became the focus of a wide search Friday as its owner pleaded with officials of 
Tower Air to ground the Boeing 747 airliner until the animal is found. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm angry and extremely worried," said Carol Ann Timmel, 26, of Beverly 
Hills, whose 3-year-old cat, Tabitha, got out of a small cage and disappeared 
in the plane's cargo hold after the airliner landed in Los Angeles on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Timmel's protests, and after a 35-minute delay during which a ground 
crew searched in vain, the airplane flew back to New York -- presumably with 
the cat somewhere aboard -- less than two hours after it arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmel said airline personnel at the airport told her that her brown, black 
and white cat disappeared into a narrow space that separates a storage 
compartment from the plane's fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I screamed, 'That plane's not going anywhere! I want my cat!' " she said. 
"But after a while they just said, "OK, wrap it up. The plane's gotta go!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at New York-based Tower Air said Friday that they were still trying 
to locate the animal, but refused a demand by Timmel's lawyer that the plane be 
taken out of service, saying there was no evidence that the cat was still 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very sensitive to the loss of this valued pet," said Nick Lacey, the 
airline's vice president of operations. "But before we essentially tear the 
underbelly of the plane apart, panel by panel, we need some evidence that the 
cat is alive and actually there." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was searched at Kennedy Airport on Friday morning and again at San 
Juan, Puerto Rico, in the afternoon. "No one reported hearing, seeing or 
smelling anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another search for the cat was to be conducted Friday night after the aircraft 
returned to New York, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Timmel was not consoled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is once Tabitha was discovered missing, the plane should have 
never been allowed to fly off," said Timmel, an actress, sitting in an empty 
apartment, where she still is awaiting her furniture after having moved from 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived Thursday aboard Tower Air Flight 21 with two pet cats: Tabitha and 
the cat's sister, Pandora, which had shared the same portable cage during the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Her troubles began after an airline employee delivered the cage with Pandora, 
but without Tabitha, once the plane was on the ground in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She said airline personnel escorted her into the plane's cargo area in the 
hopes that Tabitha -- whom ground workers had tried to coax out with food -- 
might respond to Timmel's calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, a supervisor with a walkie-talkie came over and essentially said, 
'That's it.' It's as if they decided my cat wasn't very important," Timmel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey said the airline will continue to try to find the animal. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the cat may still turn up after several days of flying across the 
continent and to the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, the airline found a cat that had been aboard one of its 
jets for 10 days, during which it made several trips between New York and 
Israel. "There's precedent for hope," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
CASTAIC LAKE ALGAE BLOOM GIVES WATER BAD TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An "especially large and persistent" algae bloom in Castaic Lake has produced 
odd-tasting water -- but no health hazard -- in parts of Los Angeles County, 
officials said today.  
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Water District spokesman Mark Beuhler said residents on the west 
side of Los Angeles County are most likely to notice the "musty" taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the algae present no health threat, there is no need for residents to 
boil the water, he said. But he recommended refrigerating the water to improve 
the taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuhler said MWD officials were trying to supply customers with water from the 
Colorado River or with a blend from Castaic Lake and other reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the hot weather in recent days and the high nutrient level of Castaic 
Lake have spurred the algae growth, and with it an increase in a compound 
called geosmin. That compound, he said, is responsible for the bad taste and 
odor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, geosmin cannot be removed from water during the filtration 
process, and Castaic Lake is too large and too widespread to attempt to 
eradicate it in the reservoir," Beuhler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People with sensitive taste and smell can detect the compound in water levels 
as low as five parts per trillion," he said. "By comparison, one part per 
trillion is equivalent to just 10 drops of geosmin in enough water to fill the 
Rose Bowl."

MTA OPPOSES COOLING-OFF PERIOD IN LABOR TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County transit officials upped the ante in their labor dispute with three key 
unions Friday by announcing that they have asked the governor not to impose a 
two-month cooling-off period.  
</P>
<P>
 Contracts with unions representing about 7,000 bus and light rail drivers, 
mechanics and clerks expired Friday, and leaders of the groups have been 
authorized by their members to call a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gov. Pete Wilson imposed a seven-day waiting period Wednesday while a 
panel of three retired judges attempted to resolve the dispute. If the judges 
decide by Wednesday that the negotiations are still deadlocked, the governor 
has the option of imposing a 60-day cooling-off period. 
</P>
<P>
 But MTA officials said they have asked Wilson not to exercise that option. 
</P>
<P>
 The unions are calling for raises and greater Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority contributions to their pension and health care plans. The MTA 
proposed freezing wages at this year's levels and cutting contributions to 
benefits plans as part of a strategy to deal with a projected $126 million 
deficit for the 1994-95 fiscal year.  
</P>
<P>
 The United Transportation Union represents about 4,400 bus drivers, followed 
by the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1277, which represents about 1,900 
mechanics, and the Transportation Communications Union Local 1315, which 
represents about 600 clerks.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; KIDNAPED 
BABY FOUND UNHARMED; SUSPECT HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A baby kidnaped from his mother at a Downtown welfare office last week was 
found unharmed Friday, and his alleged abductor, a 14-year-old girl, was 
arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl allegedly claimed that the child was hers.She told her boyfriend's 
sister-in-law that her boyfriend was the father, said Los Angeles police 
spokeswoman Sandra Castello. 
</P>
<P>
 The sister-in-law said the girl asked her to care for the infant about a week 
ago. Gomez became suspicious of the teen-ager's story and called detectives 
Friday, Castello said. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby, 6-week-old Hector Orozco, was taken to California Medical Center to 
be examined and reunited with his parents. The suspect, whose name was 
withheld, was booked on suspicion of kidnaping. She allegedly took the child 
from his mother June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's mother was standing in line at the welfare office on South Grand 
Avenuewith her son when she felt faint. A young woman approached her and asked 
if she could hold the baby, and within seconds she and Hector were gone.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PANEL 
BACKS PLAN TO ALLOW CIVILIANS ON LAPD BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council panel endorsed an ordinance Friday that would allow 
civilians to serve on LAPD disciplinary boards.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the current setup, the Los Angeles Police Department's Boards of Rights 
are composed of officers ranked captain and above.Adding civilian hearing 
examiners is intended to build public confidence in the disciplinary process 
and advance an LAPD reform agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 If the full council approves the measure, it would be another milestone in 
implementing Charter Amendment F, the sweeping reform initiative voters passed 
in 1992, a year after the police beating of Rodney G. King. Under the proposal, 
the Police Commission would make a civilian appointment when a three-member 
Board of Rights is convened for a misconduct case. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will select a member from pools of hearing officers the panel 
and Civil Service Commission tap for other administrative matters. Many 
examiners have legal backgrounds, but the Police Commission also will provide 
the necessary training, Commissioner Deirdre Hill said.  
</P>
<P>
 Boards of Rights listen to sworn testimony, rule on the admissibility of 
testimony, determine the guilt or innocence of the accused, examine personnel 
records and recommend disciplinary actions to the chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter Amendment F proponents favored filling the panels with either retired 
judges or law school professors or ordinary citizens with the proper training.  
</P>
<P>
 But leaders of the two unions who represent rank-and-file officers and LAPD 
commanders questioned the wisdom of picking people with little knowledge of 
police affairs.

LONG BEACH COUNCIL WINNER DOUBLES MARGIN IN RECOUNT, LEADS BY 2 VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A court-ordered recount of eight ballots in a narrow race for the Long Beach 
City Council stretched the lead of the winner, contractor Mike Donelon, from 
one vote to two votes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien had allowed 
candidate Tonia Reyes Uranga, the former president of the Long Beach Children's 
Museum, to inspect 29 questionable, provisional and absentee ballots that had 
been rejected from the original tally by City Clerk Shelba Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 After a nearly three-hour examination of the ballots at City Hall, Powell 
added eight to the recount when the ballots were determined to be legitimate. 
In the end, Donelon ended up with 2,936 votes to Uranga's 2,934. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is far from over," said Uranga, promising a court challenge.

JUDGE OKS PATIENTS' SUIT AGAINST COUNTY; HEALTH CARE: CLASS-ACTION CASE TARGETS 
HOSPITAL WAITING TIMES FOR THE POOR. OFFICIALS SAY THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles judge Friday authorized public-interest lawyers to proceed with 
a class-action lawsuit aimed at reducing waiting times for low-income patients 
at county clinics and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien agreed to certify the patients as a 
class in the lawsuit filed last year against the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors and Director of Health Services Robert C. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit does not seek financial damages. Instead, it seeks a court order 
requiring the county to adopt formal standards for medical care -- including 
limits on the time patients must wait for scheduled appointments and emergency 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's decision was procedural, not based on the merits of the case. His 
ruling means that attorneys will be able go forward on behalf on thousands of 
low-income patients of the county health care system, not just the handful of 
individuals whose names appear on the original complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends that despite a legal obligation to provide medical 
services for the poor, "interminable delays in delivering essential medical 
care have become the norm at the county's facilities." Without giving names or 
dates, the lawsuit cited the case of a woman who "died of a ruptured aortic 
valve after waiting for more than eight hours to be seen in the emergency room" 
at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, a woman with suspected uterine cancer was advised to get a 
hysterectomy because she would receive the surgery sooner than a biopsy from 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center," said the lawsuit, filed by the Western Center on 
Law and Poverty and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "A diabetic with failing eyesight will have to wait more than 200 days for an 
appointment, during which time he may go blind," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the county's financial distress, the fiscal crisis 
"doesn't mean that indigent persons in Los Angeles County are not to be 
provided a certain quality of medical care on a timely basis," said Silvia 
Argueta, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of 
Southern California, one of the groups filing the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have said they are doing the best they can with limited funds 
and an enormous volume of patients. Moreover, they say, the formal standards 
the lawsuit seeks are unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have standards," said Patrick Wu, a deputy county counsel handling 
the defense. "We have a policy where people are assessed individually. . . . We 
have essentially been triaging or assessing people on an individualized basis 
for . . . years." 
</P>
<P>
 The county maintains more than 50 clinics, hospitals, and health and 
rehabilitation centers, providing for nearly 5 million medical visits annually. 
The system serves tens of thousands of indigent General Relief recipients, as 
well as hundreds of thousands of Medi-Cal patients.

POLICE SEEKING MISSING GIRL, 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police continued their search Friday for a 6-year-old girl last seen on 
Thursday while playing with friends near her home in the Hyde Park area of 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappearance of Crystal Tymich prompted the Los Angeles Police Department 
to call a localized tactical alert -- which keeps officers on duty after their 
shifts end -- in the South Bureau late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 officers searched the neighborhood around the 6000 block of 
Bryhurst Avenue without success. The alert was cancelled at 4:30 a.m. Friday, 
but officers on regular duty continued to look for the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the girl as white, about 4 feet tall, weighing 60 pounds, 
with hazel eyes and long blond hair. She was wearing a pink T-shirt, 
flower-print shorts, pink socks and white tennis shoes with a picture of a 
mermaid on them when she disappeared.

GROUP TRYING TO ORGANIZE NONBELIEVERS; IMAGE: THE SMALL SHERMAN OAKS 
ORGANIZATION IS FOCUSING ON CHURCH-STATE SEPARATION ISSUES AND IS BROADCASTING 
PROGRAMS ON CABLE TELEVISION AND RADIO.

 Just because many people are deserting the ranks of organized religion doesn't 
mean that they're signing up with organized atheism -- which the militant 
unbelievers hope to change. 
</P>
<P>
 A widely discussed recent book, "The Culture of Disbelief" by Stephen Carter, 
says U.S. society largely ignores religion, and studies show that the news and 
entertainment media give short shrift to spiritual matters today. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, recent surveys, including a 1989 statewide study by UC Santa 
Barbara researchers, have shown that about 20% of adults have no religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Does all that mean popularity for Atheists United, a 12-year-old organization 
based in Sherman Oaks? No, says Ken Bonnell, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Atheists and humanists tend not to be joiners," Bonnell said. The group has 
only 350 members, and only about 100 people normally attend its monthly meeting 
at Burton Chace Park in Marina del Rey, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Prairie, who had been president since 1989, resigned last year when 
the board of the all-volunteer Atheists United denied his request to get paid 
for his work. "If they want to expand and become more than a backwater outfit, 
they need to have some paid help," Prairie said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, hope springs eternal, even among nonbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
 With a reorganization that enlists more members in more duties, Atheists 
United is also seeking a more positive public image and focusing on 
church-state separation issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is showing videotaped programs on public access cable television in 
the Los Angeles area, expanding its weekly radio program on KPFK in coming 
months and will be hosting the first national meeting of Atheists Alliance in 
the Valley next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Baker of Toluca Lake, vice president of Atheists United and co-chair of 
the Atheists Alliance meeting, brings a moderate tone to the nonbeliever 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of atheism is not enhanced by "futile attempts to convert 
fundamentalists" or by caustic critiques of religion's holy books, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my best friends are religious," said Baker, a former fashion designer 
who has been active in Democratic Party work. She said Atheists United is 
forming an activist roster and a Toastmasters club in hopes of alerting the 
public "to the dangers of religious right-wing encroachment on our secular 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time to take our place in the general community as contributors to the 
common good in practical ways," Baker urged in the organization's last 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Atheist United leaders applauded a federal lawsuit filed June 8 in Denver by 
the Freedom From Religion Foundation, challenging the presence of the motto "In 
God We Trust" on U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation, based in Madison, Wis., contended that the 1956 law placing 
the motto on money was unconstitutional because it implied government 
endorsement of religion. Two previous legal challenges to the motto, including 
one by Madalyn Murray O'Hair of Austin, Tex. -- who brought the lawsuit that 
banished Bible-reading from U.S. public schools -- were dismissed by federal 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Barker, press spokesman for the Wisconsin foundation, said the suit seeks 
to show that "In God We Trust" is commonly understood as a religious 
expression, not as a symbolic or patriotic phrase. A national survey 
commissioned by the foundation found that 61% said the motto was religious and 
71% said it endorsed a belief in God. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker credited Bonnell as "one of those people who has helped on this" by 
urging the foundation to collect evidence to support just such a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A retiree who lives in Eagle Rock, Bonnell said Atheists United has few 
resources at present to bring legal action, but he has asked Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman to reconsider the legality of a cross that was re-erected 
on county land in the Cahuenga Pass in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Atheists United was formed in the winter of 1982-83 by breakaway members of 
American Atheists, a Texas-based group founded by O'Hair, after a dispute over 
tactics. The Los Angeles chapter, which objected to Nativity displays on 
parkland owned by the city of Santa Monica, had accepted a compromise that 
permitted the atheists group to add its own display in Palisades Park. 
</P>
<P>
 After O'Hair strongly criticized them for accepting such a deal, the chapter 
officers resigned and Atheists United was formed in May, 1982, with Bonnell as 
its first president. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of atheism nationally are still struggling to get out from under the 
long shadow of O'Hair, the country's best-known atheist because of her suit 
leading to the 1962 U.S. Supreme Court decision to ban devotional Bible 
readings in public schools. O'Hair has taunted other nonbelievers to "come out 
of the closet" and declare themselves atheists rather than calling themselves 
agnostics, freethinkers or humanists.

DEMOCRATS BEGIN TO COUNTERATTACK THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT; POLITICS: AFTER IGNORING 
A CONTINUAL LASHING, PRESIDENT CLINTON GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALONG WITH TOP 
OFFICIALS. BUT THEY RISK A BACKLASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For months, President Clinton and his party have turned the other cheek in the 
face of scorching, sometimes outlandish onslaughts by religious and cultural 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But within the last 10 days, the President, his surgeon general, a member of 
the House leadership and Democratic consultants have gone out front with 
criticism of "the radical right" and its "extreme agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 The apparently uncoordinated counterattacks signal a new and potentially risky 
strategy of Democratic engagement. Even carefully calibrated critiques are 
being characterized by conservatives as religious bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver North, who won the Republican nomination for Senate in Virginia with 
strong backing from religious conservatives, applied the phrase Tuesday night 
to Clinton's outburst last week against "violent personal attacks" cloaked in 
the mantle of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a great case of religious bigotry," North said on CNN's "Larry 
King Live." "I think that the comment by President Clinton, and it was echoed 
by other leaders of that party, was a direct attack on people who work hard, 
pay the taxes and go to church." 
</P>
<P>
 Religious conservatives have been gaining influence in state Republican 
parties. Clinton, meanwhile, has been tarred as anti-family, immoral and worse 
in conservative mailings, publications and religious broadcasts almost since 
the day he took office. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Administration started off on a conciliatory mode. David Wilhelm, 
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, spoke last year to the 
million-member Christian Coalition. Clinton invited evangelical clergy to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts cite several developments that may have triggered the Democratic 
counteroffensive: the approach of midterm elections, the dominance of religious 
conservatives at state GOP conventions in Minnesota, Texas and Virginia, and a 
videotape that accuses the President of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape, produced and sold by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, features the stunning 
-- and unsubstantiated -- charge that the Clintons arranged the murder of an 
Arkansas man who allegedly had a file documenting extramarital affairs by 
Clinton since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Clinton specifically denounced Falwell and conservative commentator 
Rush Limbaugh. It was a cathartic moment for the President, but it overshadowed 
the events Clinton's staff had arranged to highlight the need for congressional 
action on a crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also a belated consensus that the President should be above this 
fray. On Monday, it was not Clinton but political adviser Paul Begala doing 
battle with Falwell on ABC's "Good Morning America." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rev. Falwell is producing and hawking a videotape that accuses our President 
of murder. It's nothing short of obscene," Begala said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never accused the President of anything," Falwell said. He attributed 
the accusations to "scores of Arkansans" and said he was justified in raising 
character questions "when the President is womanizing and living a life as he 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the politics of hate from Jerry Falwell and he should ask the 
forgiveness of the American people and God almighty," Begala replied.  
</P>
<P>
 Falwell's tactics evoke a mixed reaction from conservatives. North refused to 
criticize him, but former Education Secretary William Bennett, speaking Tuesday 
on CNBC, reproached Falwell for "messing with . . . bizarre stuff" that he 
called "beyond the pale." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Falwell-Begala exchange suggests, the new Democratic engagement is 
locking both sides into a cycle of charge-and-response. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders' reference to "the un-Christian  
</P>
<P>
 religious right" last week prompted 87 House Republicans to demand her 
resignation Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before, 44 Senate Republicans had asked Clinton to repudiate the 
religious bigotry they said was evident in remarks by Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West 
Sacramento), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Fazio 
had said religious right activists had used stealth tactics to take over state 
Republican parties and try to impose an extreme agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said speaking out does carry a risk of 
backlash. But the alternative, he said, is allowing conservative activists to 
continue to "operate beneath the radar. The danger of saying nothing is . . . 
nobody knows what they're doing or trying to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats running for state, local or congressional offices could benefit from 
depicting a Republican Party in the grip of the radical right. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it's not clear what Clinton stands to gain by drawing attention to 
the battering he and his aides are taking in conservative broadcasts and 
direct-mail appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibit A is the Falwell videotape, once familiar only to devotees of his "Old 
Time Gospel Hour" and readers of a few conservative publications. But since 
Clinton remarked on its "scurrilous and false charges," it has been a staple of 
columns, articles and talk shows.

PLAN TO EXTEND JOB HARASSMENT RULE TO RELIGION DRAWS FIRE; EMPLOYMENT: FEDERAL 
PANEL IS DELUGED WITH LETTERS FROM PEOPLE FEARING A BAN ON DISCUSSIONS IN THE 
WORKPLACE. OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY EXISTING LAW.

<P>
 They ar rived by the thousands -- letters, postcards, handwritten notes on 
loose-leaf paper. Some bore biblical passages. Others featured pictures of 
flowers or clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 And almost all of them -- nearly 56,000 at last count -- asked the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission to scuttle its proposed guidelines defining 
religious harassment in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I implore you, please come to your senses and DROP this item of consideration 
as 'harassment,' " wrote Alice Mahaffey of Warrior, Ala. "You are overstepping 
your area of expertise." 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, I think you have gone off the deep end," said John Alquist of 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unnatural for people not to talk about politics and religion, even in 
the workplace," Alquist wrote. "If you can stifle religious discussion, will 
political dissent be next? Besides, who gave you the right to suspend the 1st 
Amendment anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 The EEOC says the draft guidelines issued in October were merely an attempt to 
interpret and explain existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the guidelines was not to create any new legal theories or in 
any way abridge the exercise of free religion in the workplace," commission 
spokesman Reginald Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the proposed guidelines triggered protests from people fearing 
that they would create "religion-free work zones," or mandate freedom from 
religion instead of freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I am guaranteed freedom to practice my faith so long as it does not hinder 
the freedom of others to practice theirs. Or not to practice," wrote Don and 
Kathy Fredrickson of Gladstone, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I want to read a Bible at work, during a break, I should be allowed to do 
so and I should also be allowed to keep it on my desk at work," wrote Paul John 
Steinbart of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy erupted last fall after Atlanta labor lawyer Dudley Rochelle 
began advising her business clients that the only way to avoid religious 
harassment lawsuits under the guidelines would be to eliminate all religious 
expression from the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Church groups quickly got involved, deluging congressional offices and the 
EEOC with letters and telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 130 House members have co-sponsored legislation to require the EEOC 
to remove religion from its harassment guidelines. The Senate voted 94 to 0 on 
June 17 to urge the EEOC to rewrite the proposed guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) and Sen. Hank Brown 
(R-Colo.), also asks the commission to make clear in any new guidelines on 
workplace harassment that religious symbols or expressions of religious beliefs 
are not restricted and cannot be used to prove harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 As originally drafted, the guidelines define unlawful harassment as any verbal 
or physical conduct that "denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an 
individual because of his/her . . . religion . . . or that of his/her 
relatives, friends or associates." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch said they will now be redrafted to address the concerns of the people 
who made comments. He gave no timetable and said the new version might be 
published for public comment before the commission takes final action. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission is not inclined to drop religion from the guidelines.  
</P>
<P>
 "To not speak to the fact that religious harassment does occur would perhaps 
elicit the comments and concerns of many of the same people who are saying it 
shouldn't be there," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who wrote to the EEOC voiced surprise that anyone experiences religious 
harassment in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so little record of this kind of harassment . . . that the time and 
taxpayer money you've spent to investigate and propose this thing is 
ridiculous," wrote Philip Hall, president of Tropical Screw Products Co. in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the numbers of religion-based complaints filed with the EEOC has been 
small: 1,386 out of 72,120 complaints filed in the 1992 fiscal year, and 1,449 
out of 87,887 last year, spokeswoman Hope Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 But of several hundred complaints examined by Associated Press, a handful 
mentioned firsthand knowledge of what might be considered religious harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know from experience when another person is constantly preaching their 
religious beliefs and/or is trying constantly to get you to go to church over 
and over, even when you keep saying no," wrote Sue Peters of Sheboygan, Wis. 
"It is very harassing and really does create an unhealthy and hostile 
environment."

DODGERS GO SOUTH AGAINST PHILLIES; BASEBALL: GROSS' SEASON-HIGH SEVEN WALKS AND 
L.A.'S STRUGGLE AGAINST LEFT-HANDED PITCHERS COSTLY IN 3-0 LOSS TO 
PHILADELPHIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kevin Gross needed to be perfect, and he wasn't. Dodger batters needed to 
figure out how to hit a left-handed starter -- any left-handed starter -- and 
they couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger fans needed a reason to stay beyond the sixth inning, and they didn't 
get one. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in a sloppy, choppy game full of walks and wild pitches, misplays and long 
periods of tedium, the Dodgers lost ugly, 3-0, to the Philadelphia Phillies 
Friday night before 34,978 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a weird night," Corey Snyder said. "They didn't really do anything 
extra special. We just seemed a little dead tonight for some reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling with his control from the outset, Gross (7-5) walked a season-high 
seven Phillies in seven-plus innings and gave up all three runs in a 
particularly boring fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies were without Darren Daulton, Len Dykstra and Dave Hollins, their 
best three hitters, because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if I kept it close I'd be all right, that I could keep the run 
production down," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a lot of right-handers in the lineup, no Dykstra, Daulton, or 
Hollins, and they're all lefties, but they are a team that went to the World 
Series last year." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without that one inning, it was a decent game for me. I feel terrible about 
those walks. I was close, but just missing four or five inches off the plate, 
six inches up in the zone, I guess, according to the umpires." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, David West, who hadn't pitched more than seven innings all season 
and is best known for his World Series debacles last year, became the latest 
left-hander to handcuff the Dodgers, who have won only seven of 21 games 
against left-handed starters this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, whose most dangerous hitters are right-handed, are 34-24 against 
right-handed starters. 
</P>
<P>
 In eight innings, West (3-6) held the Dodgers to three hits, all of them 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was a case of a guy who pitched a great, great game," Gross said of 
West. "He's the hardest-throwing left-hander in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Jones came on in the ninth to add the final insult, pitching a perfect 
inning by striking out Mike Piazza and Tim Wallach and inducing a flyball from 
Eric Karros with an array of off-speed pitches. Jones recorded his National 
League-leading 21st save. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fourth, the Dodgers, who had their 11-game streak in which they hit 
at least one home run ended, never got a runner past second base, and the last 
seven Dodgers were retired in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is this strange? Because West came into the game succeeding against 
left-handed hitters (who were batting only .100 against him), but the Dodger 
lineup, as usual, was stocked with right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept us off balance all night," Snyder said. "I think we swung at some bad 
pitches too. He just seemed to get ahead of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't put two or three hits together tonight. It's kind of crazy. 
We're usually not like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillie hitters themselves could fashion only seven hits -- and only one 
of those was anything more than a single. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the fifth, three Gross walks, one Raul Mondesi error and two 
run-scoring singles were enough. 
</P>
<P>
 In that inning, John Kruk's bases-loaded single scored Kevin Stocker and Billy 
Hatcher, to make it 2-0. Pete Incaviglia followed that with a single, scoring 
Mickey Morandini. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of how this game was won, the light-hitting Morandini walked his 
first three times, then, in the sixth inning, reached base on in his fourth 
at-bat when he grounded a ball through the legs of third baseman Wallach. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who also threw two wild pitches, flirted with trouble early, walking 
four Phillies in the first three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross' most serious problem early came in the third, when he gave up two 
two-out walks, but he struck out Incaviglia to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' best threat came in the third when Rafael Bournigal singled, was 
bunted to second, and Delino DeShields walked. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with two out, West struck out Mitch Webster to prevent any damage.

ANGELS CAN'T KEEP PACE WITH ONLY FIVE HOMERS; BASEBALL: THE ORIOLES HIT SIX AND 
WIN, 14-7, AS THE TEAMS TIE THE MAJOR LEAGUE RECORD OF 11 HOME RUNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You get the feeling that if the Angels ever won a $10-million lottery, they 
would lose the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 If they won a car at the church raffle, they would run into a tree pulling out 
of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the Angels, the Peanuts Gang of major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, the Angels hit five home runs against All-Star pitcher Mike 
Mussina, scored more runs in the first five innings than in their last four 
games combined and . . . ready for the punch line? 
</P>
<P>
 They lost, 14-7, to the Baltimore Orioles before 47,342 delirious fans at 
Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Angels fell only one homer shy of their franchise record, they gave 
up six homers to the Orioles, tying a major league record of 11 homers hit by 
two teams in one game. It was previously done seven times, the last on Sept. 
14, 1987, when the Toronto Blue Jays hit 10 homers to the Orioles' one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it, I was part of it, but I still can't believe what happened," said 
Angel left fielder Jim Edmonds, who hit the last Angel homer in the fifth. "It 
was like playing in the Texas League without the wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel reliever Russ Springer, who yielded one of the homers: "I've been 
involved in some weird games, but not one like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you turned around, a ball was going out of the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 There were home runs by nine players against four pitchers, in every inning 
until the eighth. They were hit by every position player except third base and 
second base in every direction but straightaway center and traveled a total of 
4,085 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to break out another box of Titleists and go out there again 
tomorrow," said Mussina, who won his 12th game despite yielding five homers, 10 
hits and seven earned runs in five innings. It was the most homers given up by 
an Oriole since Jim Palmer on June 22, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was liking dunking in a basketball game," Mussina said. "There were 11 
homers. Sometimes, there aren't even 11 dunks in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad I got out of there without getting hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 But no one is incurring more abuse these days than the Angels, who suffered 
the ultimate embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 They fell to last in the pitiful American League West, dropping to a 
season-low 14 games under .500 at 33-47. Instead of showing even the slightest 
improvement, the Angels have lost 21 of their last 31 games. They now have the 
second-worst record in major league baseball, managing to stay ahead of only 
the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's frustrating is that we make movements forward," Angel pitcher Chuck 
Finley said, "and fall back in the same hole. You'd think after a while our 
eyes will open up and we'd move on, but it's like we're taking one step forward 
and two steps back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's (management's) choice if they're going to correct it, or else we're all 
going to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Every time the Angels find a way to plug one problem, a leak pops up 
elsewhere. They began the game having failed to score in their last 22 innings, 
scoring two or fewer runs in six of their last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Tim Salmon ended the streak with a two-out homer in the first 
inning. Chad Curtis hit a solo homer in the second inning. Chili Davis hit a 
homer in the fourth. Salmon and Edmonds hit homers in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was one little problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Joe Magrane couldn't stop the Orioles, who have now homered in a 
club-record 17 consecutive games. He gave up a run-scoring single to Leo Gomez 
in the first, a run-scoring groundout to Brady Anderson and a three-run homer 
to Rafael Palmeiro in the second and left after giving up solo homers to Gomez 
and Jeffrey Hammonds in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I changed the whole complexion of the game," said Magrane, who yielded six 
hits and seven runs -- four earned -- in 2 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, after trailing by 7-3 after two innings, the Angels managed to pull to 
8-7 after five innings. The trouble was that the Orioles now had gotten into 
the Angel bullpen. Curtis took a homer away from Chris Hoiles in the fifth 
inning, but Springer gave up three runs in the sixth, including Cal Rikpen's 
300th homer as a shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Lefferts took his turn in the seventh, and promptly gave up back-to-back 
homers to Hoiles and Hammonds that tied the record. And Joe Grahe nearly gave 
up the record-setting homer in the eighth to Palmeiro, but wound up giving up 
only one run created by Chris Sabo's leadoff triple. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like something you see on ESPN," Lefferts said. "It's not something 
you want to be part of, and it's certainly not a record to be proud about." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was a record that left Manager Marcel Lachemann fuming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty poorly pitched," he said, "in fact, very poorly pitched. When you get 
3-and-0, 2-and-0 counts, you're going to get whacked. It's that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get seven runs off Mussina, and don't win. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann's voice trailed off and he lowered his head, grimacing as he scoured 
the statistical sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 His face said it all. Home Run Derby 
</P>
<P>

IVANISEVIC'S GAME DOES THE TALKING; WIMBLEDON: NORMALLY HOT-TEMPERED CROATIAN 
WILL PLAY SAMPRAS IN MEN'S FINAL AFTER KEEPING HIS VOW NOT TO THROW TANTRUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even with the Archbishop of Canterbury in the Royal Box, Todd Martin didn't 
have a prayer against top-seeded Pete Sampras, who actually lost a set but not 
much else during Friday's men's singles semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras beat the sixth-seeded Martin, 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, though no one was 
rushing to store the videotape of this one in the Wimbledon vaults. It had all 
the excitement of a Sampras postmatch news conference -- "If I play consistent, 
I'm tough to beat. . . . If I play consistent, I'm tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Both players knew the match was something of a dud. Sure it went four sets, 
but only because Sampras misplaced his serve during the third and couldn't take 
full advantage of a weary Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play great by any means, either one of us," said Sampras, the 
defending champion. "So it's a good one to get through." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras next will face fourth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, the caustic Croatian 
who serves as if he's good enough to win his first title in a Grand Slam event. 
Ivanisevic swept past No. 7 Boris Becker in straight sets, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, 
and not once did he throw a racket in anger or unleash a string of Croatian 
expletives -- his trademark in years past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have to admit I lost to a great player today," said Becker, a 
three-time champion here. "Goran Ivanisevic probably played the best match of 
his career." 
</P>
<P>
 Not much to question about his game Friday. Ivanisevic, who holds the world 
record for fastest serve, 136 m.p.h., got 21 aces against the mostly helpless 
Becker. That gives Ivanisevic 140 aces for the tournament, 40 more than Sampras 
-- no slouch himself when it comes to aces -- but well below his amazing 206 a 
couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker never broke Ivanisevic's serve or his concentration. In the past, that 
was the way to rattle him. Fluster him and then wait for the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic has been an angel this time around. He has a bet with former tour 
player Ion Tiriac and Formula One magnate Bernie Eccleston that he won't toss 
his racket during the fortnight. And then there is the pre-Wimbledon vow 
Ivanisevic made to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, 'Let's try to be cool,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool he has been. As chilled as champagne on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker told him afterward that if he remains equally composed against Sampras, 
the championship could be his to take to Croatia, the first Grand Slam event 
title for the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident," he said. "I mean, I'm playing Pete." 
</P>
<P>
 Not many players can say that and mean it. But Ivanisevic holds a 5-3 lead in 
their matches, a 14-7 lead in sets won, a 6-3 lead in tiebreakers won and a 1-0 
lead in Grand Slam matches won -- the 1992 Wimbledon quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sampras and Ivanisevic haven't played one another this year -- the year 
when Sampras separated himself from the rest of the world -- and in their last 
meeting, a 1993 ATP tournament, Sampras won. Chances also are that Sampras 
won't have another match like Friday's, when he struggled with his serve and 
had to play despite a slightly sprained right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "On break points throughout the match I really served well, but throughout the 
whole match the rhythm wasn't there," Sampras said. "It didn't click like it 
has been throughout the week." 
</P>
<P>
 But he still earned a second consecutive trip to the final. OK, he gave up two 
break points -- he has lost only three for the entire tournament -- and 
foot-faulted twice. Then there was the bothersome third set, when he won only 
50% of his first-serve points. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it was the first match of the fortnight that didn't meet Sampras' 
standards. Everything was a little off. Not fatally, but enough to be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin saw it. But after having already played four five-set matches, he 
couldn't do much about it. His legs were shot, his serve inconsistent. He 
arrived at the semifinals with seven hours' more court time than Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I would have done better," said Martin, who was treated for an 
unspecified illness or injury after the match -- he wouldn't say which. "I'm 
pleased with myself because I didn't think I played all that poorly, but I 
certainly had a chance to win the match and that's disappointing in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with three break points in the first set, Sampras responded with two 
aces and a service winner. He won the second set on an ace and fought off five 
break points before winning the fourth and deciding set. To do that, he hit two 
aces and three service winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Now on to the final and Ivanisevic.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody say Pete is favorite," Ivanisevic said. "So that's nice to hear and 
I go there and we see."

GOLF ROUNDUP; RAIN DISRUPTS PLAY IN SENIOR OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simon Hobday, playing at a record pace on rain-softened greens, grabbed a 
two-shot lead Friday in the storm-disrupted and uncompleted second round of the 
U.S. Senior Open at Pinehurst, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobday was nine under par for the tournament and on the 18th hole when play 
was halted. A par when play resumes today will leave him tied for the 
tournament record for 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 He was among 33 players still on the rain-soaked course when darkness fell at 
the Pinehurst Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Albus, who shared the first-round lead with Hobday, completed a 69 and was 
the clubhouse leader at seven-under 135, and Australian Graham Marsh was next 
at 136. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain softened the greens, smoothed out the spike marks and provided the 
late starters with a major advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made the greens so soft that if you had your irons zeroed in, you could go 
right for the flag. But the biggest advantage was that the rains smoothed out 
the greens," Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Jack Nicklaus and Ray Floyd each shot 68 and reached the 
tournament halfway point at 137. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Western Open defending champion Nick Price saved par on his fourth hole with a 
miraculous shot from a bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 Price went on to finish with his second consecutive five-under-par 67 to take 
a one-stroke lead after two rounds in Lemont, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Price's drive on the 416-yard fourth hole went into the water. After a drop 
into the rough, his third shot skidded into the bunker and then he holed it 
from about 40 feet to save par. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Mickelson, who shared the first-round lead with four others, trails Price 
by a single stroke after shooting a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Green shot a five-under-par 67 for a one-shot lead after the first round 
of the Youngstown-Warren LPGA Classic at Youngstown, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Nancy Lopez, trying to become the first repeat winner of 
this tournament, shot a 71.

MORNING BRIEFING: SANDBERG CAN'T STAY AWAY FROM THE BAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Calcavecchia's caddie is the biggest celebrity in the Western Open this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The bag carrier is none other than Ryne Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The All-Star second baseman, who stunned the baseball world by retiring from 
the Chicago Cubs two weeks ago, is doing a neighborly thing. He and 
Calcavecchia both live in the Phoenix area. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandberg, 34, is a six-handicap golfer who said he has always wanted to caddie 
in a pro tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Relative worth: Calcavecchia ranks 76th on the money list this year with 
$142,768. His caddie made $8.6 million last year and, even after forfeiting 
much of this year's salary, about $2 million this year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: When Martina Navratilova won the first of her nine Wimbledon 
singles championships in 1978, whom did she beat in the final? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is it contagious? How bad is the injury karma around the Philadelphia 
Phillies, who have had 11 players on the disabled list? So bad that team 
physician Phillip Marone worries about a spillover effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so bad this year that even (pitcher) Shawn Boskie's wife breaks her 
shoulder roller-blading and Vinnie Vukovich (son of coach John Vukovich) breaks 
his hand playing baseball," Marone said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty feat: Twenty-eight times a player has hit two home runs in one inning 
in the major leagues, but no Dodger has ever done it. Rick Reichardt of the 
Angels did it in the eighth inning on April 30, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what about Big D? Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show": "The Houston Rockets, 
the NBA champions of the world! Do you realize this breaks a losing streak of 
Texas teams that goes all the way back to the Alamo?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm, what about the Cowboys? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strong talk: Atlanta pitcher Steve Avery doesn't like playing in Denver's Mile 
High Stadium, and he doesn't care who knows it. He wrote a story for the Rocky 
Mountain News in which he said: 
</P>
<P>
 "When we come back to Denver to play again, I'm hoping it's not my turn to 
pitch. I'll develop acute bronchitis or something that is undetectable. It's an 
intimidating place to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "You throw thousands of pitches a year and they all do the same thing except 
when you go to Denver. The breaking ball doesn't have the same bite, and the 
changeup doesn't have the same drop." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wolverine watch: Vartan Kupelian in the Detroit News: "The United States 
soccer team has a better record in the Rose Bowl than Michigan's football 
team." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tough times: If baseball players go out on strike, Gene Collier of the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says Barry Bonds will have to make do on $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the International Red Cross should be advised," Collier wrote.

 Germany vs. Belgium 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 10 a.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ABC, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: In a defensive struggle, the game could come down to a 
make-or-break showdown between Germany's Juergen Klinsmann and Michel 
Preud'homme, Belgium's brilliant goalkeeper. After the first round, only 
Russia's Oleg Salenko had scored more goals than Klinsmann. Salenko, of course, 
scored five of his six in one game, against Cameroon. Klinsmann, who has four, 
scored at least one goal in every match. Preud'homme finished group play as the 
top-ranked goalkeeper among those who played three games. He gave up one goal 
-- the game-winner against Saudi Arabia -- while making 17 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Offense has been a problem for Belgium, which scored two goals in three games. 
More bad news: One of its two goal scorers was forward Marc Degryse, who 
suffered a groin injury against the Saudis and probably won't play today. 
Belgium thought it had an offensive spark in Josip Weber, the Croatian-born 
forward who led the Belgian league in scoring the last two seasons. The knock 
on Weber was he disappeared for stretches during matches. After three games, 
Belgium is preparing an all-points bulletin: In 217 minutes, Weber has no goals 
or assists. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Both teams are somewhat strapped. Berti Vogts, the German coach, 
still hasn't decided who will play forward opposite Klinsmann: Rudi Voeller or 
Mario Basler. Belgium is two victories shy of equaling its 1986 performance 
when it reached the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: The German defense will be vulnerable if sweeper Lothar Matthaeus' 
injured left foot is less than 100%. The German goaltending has been shaky of 
late. The Germans are poised for a fall. While Belgium doesn't have the offense 
to take advantage, it can lean on Preud'homme. This game will end in a 0-0 tie 
and go to a shootout. There, Preud'homme saves the day and Belgium pulls off 
the upset. CHRIS DUFRESNE

 Spain vs. Switzerland 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1:30 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: This is a battle of teams that mirror each other. Both bland, 
both defensive minded, neither with much chance of showing up at the Rose Bowl 
in the third week of July. The Swiss have advanced as far as the quarterfinals 
once in six World Cup appearances; the Spaniards have survived this second 
round twice in eight appearances. In three first-round games, Switzerland 
outscored its opponents, 5-4. Spain outscored it opponents, 6-4. Each team took 
50 shots. Switzerland gave up 24 shots, Spain 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The game will be decided in the matchup of midfielders. Spaniards Juan Antonio 
Goikoetxea and Josep Guardiola have combined for three goals and one assist. 
They will be pitted against Georges Bregy and Alain Sutter, Swiss midfielders 
who have also combined for three goals. The most important midfielder, however, 
could be the one who doesn't play. Spaniard Jose Luis Caminero, who scored 
twice in a five-minute span against Bolivia, picked up his second yellow card 
of the first round in the final minutes of a victory and will sit out this 
game. The Swiss' two top forwards, Adrian Knup and Stephane Chapuisat, could be 
in for a beating. Spanish defenders Albert Ferrer and Abelardo Fernandez have 
teamed for 17 personal fouls, more than Switzerland's entire defense combined. 
This game also marks the return of a third powerful Spanish defender, captain 
Miguel Angel Nadal, who sat out the last two games because of a red-card 
violation in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: It is uncertain which teams will show. Will it be the Swiss team 
that muddled through a 1-1 tie with the United States and a 2-0 loss to 
Colombia or the Swiss team that soundly whipped Group A champion Romania, 4-1? 
Will this be the Spanish team that gave up two goals in the final minutes to 
South Korea in a 2-2 tie or the Spanish team that led defending champion 
Germany for 24 minutes before fighting to a 1-1 tie? The only certainty is that 
the Swiss team comprises individual stars who often act like individual stars. 
The Swiss had only one assist in the first round. The Spaniards, nine of whom 
played for the same Barcelona team in their country's tough pro league, act 
much more like one unit. They compiled six assists. It is that sort of behavior 
that usually wins World Cup games. The Spaniards also have the advantage of 
having played their first-round games under the broiling sun in Dallas and 
Chicago. The Swiss played twice indoors in Pontiac, Mich., and then once in the 
low humidity of Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: The reign of Spain will not fall gently on the Swiss. Neither is 
playing well enough to win this game and be considered among the world's best 
eight teams, but the Spanish have enough ability to fake it for 90 minutes. 
Spain by two. BILL PLASCHKE

 "I never thought I'd write this, but I'm a bit afraid of playing against the 
United States. It's obvious that, normally, any Brazilian team not composed 
exclusively of wooden leg players would beat the United States. But the way we 
are playing, under pressure to not lose, I prepare myself for 90 minutes of 
suffering and exasperation, as with the awful game against Sweden."

 Although many reporters asked Ireland Coach Jack Charlton about playing Brazil 
in the quarterfinals, he cautioned about looking too far ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 That applied not only to his own team, which faces the Netherlands, but to the 
Brazil-U.S. match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows, we might be playing the Americans," Charlton said. "It's not 
beyond the realm of possibility. Everybody is assuming Brazil will beat 
America. Everybody's assuming the Dutch might beat us. You just take it one 
game at a time, that old cliche." HELENE ELLIOTT

Brazil, Galvao Bueno of Globo television was caught complaining about Pele's 
commentary during Brazil's game against Sweden. 
</P>

 Viewers heard someone at the station ask Bueno to get Pele to "stop talking so

him to stop talking."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; THE VIEW FROM ACROSS THE POND 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the English press, having no team in the competition and very little 
tolerance for how soccer is treated in the colonies, World Cup '94 is not 
exactly Happy Days. With only the team from the Republic of Ireland to root for 
-- a disgusting fate but a tad better than pulling for, say, the Germans -- 
they have been reduced to jabbing the USA. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the better samples, both from The Sun: 
</P>
<P>
 June 22: "Whoever had done this grass (at Soldier Field in Chicago) had been 
smoking it, too. Normally, their stadiums (in the United States) use AstroTurf 
-- to stop the crowds from grazing at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
 June 24: "America was a nation in ecstasy yesterday, gripped by 
self-adulation. From being a TV tailpiece, soccer was suddenly headline news. 
The victory (over Colombia) was greater than that over England 44 years ago 
because this has set up the entire tournament for skeptical hosts whose initial 
purpose was merely to hire out the halls." 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the Daily Mail story from June 18: 
</P>
<P>
 "There is, however, one English hopeful who stands alone. In the final game of 
the 1974 World Cup, Jack Taylor, a butcher from Wolverhampton, awarded a 
penalty to each team in West Germany's 2-1 victory over Holland. Then, as now, 
England had failed to qualify. Now, as then, a referee offers our best chance 
of seeing an Englishman take part in the World Cup final. So, if you feel you 
have to wave your Union Jack boxer shorts for somebody, here's your man. Mr. 
Philip Don of Handsworth Park, Middlesex, good luck. A nation watches." BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Peter Bridgwater, a former English policeman and now a Bay Area soccer 
promoter, learned that the World Cup was coming to Stanford Stadium, his wish 
was for the United States to meet England there on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 England, alas, did not qualify for the tournament. So he made another wish -- 
for the United States to meet Brazil there on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm over the moon," said Bridgwater, the World Cup's Palo Alto venue 
director, when that second-round matchup became a reality earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, inside the trailer next to the stadium that serves as his temporary 
office, Bridgwater seemed more under the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still very excited," he said. "It's the game of the tournament, and, for 
us, it's like having the final here. But, as amazing as it seems, who would 
have thought you couldn't find a marching band on July 4?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things he did after learning the United States would be 
playing in Palo Alto on Monday was invite President Clinton and Vice President 
Al Gore. They have not accepted. But neither have they turned him down. He said 
he would like for them to RSVP ASAP so that he and his security staff could 
begin preparing. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, his most pressing problems concerned pregame and halftime 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 He initially thought about putting on a red, white and blue extravaganza 
before remembering that there will be a team on the field that is not 
celebrating the Fourth of July. So he ordered two massive flags to be unfurled 
before the game, one from the United States and one from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 To give the game a holiday flavor, he also arranged for fireworks to be set 
off after the national anthems. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is still negotiating with the Defense Department for a pregame 
fly-over, and, he lamented, there are no marching bands to be found anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them are booked on that day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 How about the Stanford band? 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect the Stanford band," he said, diplomatically, "but I think they're 
on vacation." RANDY HARVEY

 There is still much about soccer that confuses us, but we do understand cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Rating the World Cup's final 16 teams, in order of style: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Saudi Arabia: Goalkeeper Muhammad Al Deayea wears long pants even in 
90-degree heat, can dunk a basketball with two hands backward, and wants to 
play in the NBA if the royal family will ever let him out of its sight.And if 
that's not enough, Coach Jorge Solari smokes tiny cigarettes during the games 
while wearing a '50s-era suit and tie. Afterward, the players kiss their local 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Belgium: Players hold hands during their national anthem as a silent 
example of unity for their ethnically divided countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Ireland: Their fans love to chant: "Oh, ah, Paul Ma-graw, say oh ah Paul 
Ma-graw. " If you don't recognize that Ma-graw is the Gaelic pronunciation of 
McGrath then you'll never understand that they are talking about their star 
defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
 4) United States: People who know more about this than us said that as well as 
bringing together the best 22 soccer players in the United States, Bora 
Milutinovic has also assembled the 22 best-looking guys. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Italy: Midfielder Dino Baggio has established himself as perhaps the 
tournament's coolest player by wearing a white sweatband above one hand . Think 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Argentina: Goalkeeper Luis Islas has won the hearts of Americans everywhere 
by being one of the few players in the tournament with enough sense to wear a 
baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 7) Nigeria: From lobe to lobe, the best earrings in the tourney.  
</P>
<P>
 8) Switzerland: With apologies to every player who has attempted to outdo each 
other in number and color of dreadlocks, the best hair in the tournament is the 
long, flowing blond locks of midfielder Alain Sutter. BILL PLASCHKE

 If there is no huge halftime show, how can it be like a Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that -- and several million television viewers -- might be the only 
thing that separates U.S.-Brazil from American football's championship game, 
Bay Area ticket brokers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's monster big," David Green of the Best Seats agency in Lafayette said in 
the San Francisco Examiner. "It's the biggest sporting event we've ever seen 
here. Bigger than the Super Bowl, bigger than the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just the game. People want to go to be part of the whole 
scene. It's Mardi Gras outside the game. It's the Olympic spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 David Gazay of Peninsula Box Office in Palo Alto confirmed Friday that brokers 
are cashing in. 
</P>
<P>
 The least expensive tickets, sold originally for $35, are going for $150, he 
said, and the most expensive tickets, sold originally for $85, are going for 
$275. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our phones haven't stopped ringing," he said. RANDY HARVEY

<P>
 Now that you've met the eight most stylish teams in the Round of 16, let's 
look at the uncool teams, starting with the uncoolest of them all: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Netherlands: When asked about their chances in the tournament, some of them 
like to glare down at questioners and simply announce that, "We . . . are . . . 
Holland." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck in a bracket with Ireland and Brazil, they . . . are . . . also . . . . 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Germany: Note to Stefan Effenberg: The only person who can get away with 
flipping the bird to fans in Dallas is Charles Haley. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Spain: After their final first-round victory against Bolivia, Prince 
Felipe, heir to the Spanish throne, came into the locker room and criticized 
star Jose Luis Caminero for receiving a red card. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Brazil: Members of their press contingent are upset because they are not 
allowed to interview their goalkeeper on the field during the game. We are not 
making this up. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Sweden: It is rumored that many of the young men who paint their faces blue 
and gold and sit in the stands waving Swedish flags wouldn't know Stockholm 
from South Pasadena. They are local college students trying to meet blond 
Swedish women. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Mexico: Coach Miguel Mejia Baron is a dead ringer for Oakland Athletic 
Manager Tony La Russa. That's cool enough for us. 
</P>
<P>
 7) Romania: This Anghel Iordanescu-coached team has more vowels than fans. But 
after every game, players run around the field and try to thank each member of 
their cheering section personally.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; DE LA HOYA RUBS SOME WRONG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boos. Cheers. Shrieks. Was this a boxer or a rock star? 
</P>
<P>
 When Oscar De La Hoya made his usual flashy ringside appearance, a night at 
the Forum that was supposed to showcase Jorge Paez was transformed into a sea 
of conflicting emotions and teeny-bopper mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, scheduled to fight Paez on July 29 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, 
was at the Forum on June 11 to watch Paez defeat Juan Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 And though any scouting he might have done probably was hindered by the line 
of young women and other fans wanting autographs, De La Hoya noticed that the 
unheralded Gomez hit Paez hard and often through the 10-round fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Robert (Alcazar, his trainer) said, this is going to be the easiest 
fight ever in my career," De La Hoya said later that night. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the sort of comment, however true it might be, that irks local boxing 
fans, who have long embraced Paez as one of their own and consider De La Hoya 
awesomely talented but someone who has had too much too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Easiest fight ever? 
</P>
<P>
 In his 13 professional fights, De La Hoya has been carefully matched against 
boxers with little experience or name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 That changes with Paez, who is past his prime as a featherweight champion but 
has fought 61 times against some of the best in the world. He is known for his 
wild, clown-like antics, both in the ring and out. 
</P>
<P>
 Put plainly: Until now, De La Hoya has never really gone into a professional 
fight in which many expected him, even wanted him, to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Put even more plainly: De La Hoya had never been booed before. Especially not 
in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess there's a lot of jealous people out there," said De La Hoya, who is 
13-0 in his 18-month career. "People want me to fight against good fighters 
already, at the early stage of my career. All I have to do is get a few more 
fights under my belt and people will know who the real champion is. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are going for Paez. That makes me train harder because I want 
to knock him out in the first or second round to show people how much better I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Alcazar: "There's a lot of people who think Paez can beat him. But I 
think he's going to be easy. We're not exactly worried about this fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Alcazar pointed out that many in the Forum crowd that booed De La Hoya were 
Mexican national partisans of Paez, or maybe part of a large group that was 
with World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight champion Genaro Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid doesn't deserve that," Alcazar said. "What he did for this country 
and for those people's country (Mexico) too, he put that country way up on the 
top. I don't think Oscar deserved to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar wasn't bothered at all. He just said, 'That's boxing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Paez shouted something to De La Hoya from the ring ropes, and Hernandez, who 
has accused De La Hoya of ducking him, wandered up to De La Hoya to shake his 
hand as thousands of onlookers craned their heads for possible fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Paez was announced the winner, De La Hoya was whisked out a security 
entrance, and the theatrics were over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paez is geeked up for De La Hoya," trainer Alex Shearer said. "No offense to 
Oscar, he's a nice-looking kid, talks good, he's pretty. But a pretty car 
doesn't always win the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous amount of pressure on him. He's got a burden to be over 
and above at such an early stage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming De La Hoya defeats Paez, Alcazar says there are plans to go on a 
world tour for the rest of 1994, then prepare for a big fight against 
International Boxing Federation lightweight champion Rafael Ruelas in early 
1995. A showdown with Genaro Hernandez, Alcazar says, would follow that. 
</P>
<P>
 "After this fight, we're going to fight in Mexico and Japan and we have plans 
for Africa," Alcazar said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Bodak, who serves as cut man for Paez and De La Hoya, has been asked by 
both camps to work in their corners and has chosen loyalty over cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodak has decided that, unless the Nevada State Athletic Commission allows him 
to serve both fighters, he will sit out the bout and forfeit a $10,000 payday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a great believer in loyalty," Bodak said. "I've worked with both, think 
the world of both, and to me, loyalty is a lot more important than money. Even 
if I was destitute, I'd do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada commission, said it would be 
highly unlikely that anybody would be allowed to work both corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcazar says he respects Bodak's position and explains that if anybody needs a 
top-flight cut man, it isn't De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a big advantage in this area," Alcazar said. "I think Oscar's going 
to destroy Paez just with the jab. He's going to cut his face all over." 
Calendar 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez vs. Carlos Eluaiza, flyweights; Alfred 
Ankamah vs. Marco Antonio Lizarraga, welterweights; Juan Valencia vs. Erisel

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; JEFFERIES RETURNS WITH HOT BAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a good thing Gregg Jefferies didn't need any speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferies returned to the lineup after a six-game absence with two home runs 
and three runs batted in, despite an injured heel as the Cardinals defeated the 
Colorado Rockies, 11-4, Friday at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping those balls would go out so I wouldn't have to run," said 
Jefferies, who hadn't started since getting spiked in his right heel June 22. 
"It was sore, without question." 
</P>
<P>
 The injury required six stitches. Four were removed on Thursday but two were 
left in, and trainers customized his shoe by removing the back and replacing it 
with a plastic plate to relieve pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 4, Atlanta 3 -- Kurt Abbott drove home Greg Colbrunn with a 
run-scoring single in the 11th inning to give the Marlins a victory at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was only the third in 12 games for the Marlins, who got strong 
pitching from starter Mark Gardner and relievers Yorkis Perez, Robb Nen and 
John Johnstone (1-0), who pitched two innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Avery, who hasn't won in his last eight starts for Atlanta, gave up 
three runs, struck out four and walked none through eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, Houston 2 -- Rookie Steve Trachsel allowed six hits in 8 1/3 
innings and kept his perfect road record intact thanks to Sammy Sosa's 17th 
home run for the Cubs at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel (7-5) improved his road record to 6-0, striking out six and walking 
two. Doug Drabek (10-5) failed in his second consecutive attempt to win 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 4, Pittsburgh 2 -- John Roper remained unbeaten this season, 
stopping the Pirates' eight-game home winning streak by repeatedly pitching out 
of trouble for the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Roper (5-0) pitched out of jams in the first two innings, then settled down to 
allow only solo homers by Orlando Merced and Andy Van Slyke as the Reds won for 
the ninth time in his 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 10, San Diego 7 -- Bobby Bonilla, Kelly Stinnett and Jim Lindeman 
each hit two-run home runs to lead the Mets at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Jones (8-7) pitched six-plus innings, allowing three runs and three 
hits. He tied a season high with seven strikeouts and walked four. Bill Krueger 
(0-1), the 13th pitcher to start for the Padres this season, allowed five runs 
and six hits in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 14, Montreal 7 -- Matt Williams hit his 30th home run and had 
five RBIs as the Giants took advantage of a seven-run second inning at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams did his damage in the first six innings before leaving because of a 
strained left hip, an injury not believed to be serious. John Patterson had a 
career-high four hits with two doubles, three RBIs and three runs scored for 
the Giants, who scored a season high in runs.

<P>
 The Boston Red Sox traded slumping relief pitcher Jeff Russell to the 
Cleveland Indians for pitchers Chris Nabholz and Steve Farr. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell (0-5), who gave up one run and three hits while pitching the ninth 
inning of Boston's 6-3 loss to the Oakland Athletics on Friday, has 12 saves in 
15 opportunities this season with a 5.14 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 He got his fifth loss Wednesday when he gave up a 10th-inning homer to Danny 
Tartabull in a 4-3 loss to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabholz, a left-hander who was 3-1 on a rehabilitation assignment with 
triple-A Charlotte while recovering from a strained upper back, is scheduled to 
start Sunday for the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Farr, a right-handed reliever who is on the disabled list because of a stiff 
neck, is expected to be ready to pitch for Boston on July 10. 
</P>

 Red Sox Manager Butch Hobson, already under fire for his club's recent woes, 
was suspended for five games for shoving an umpire. Hobson has appealed the 
decision by American League President Bobby Brown. A hearing is pending. . . . 
Houston Astro General Manager Bob Watson, 48, announced that he has prostate 
cancer and will have the gland removed Wednesday in St. Louis. He will be 
hospitalized for five days, then return to Houston to recuperate. Watson is 
expected to resume a limited work schedule after a recovery period estimated at 
30 days. . . . Chicago Cub announcer Harry Caray remained hospitalized for 
treatment of a rapid heart beat. Caray, 77, was admitted to Northwestern 
Memorial in Chicago last Saturday after being discharged three days earlier 
from a Florida hospital, where he was taken after he fell while leaving a 
dugout at Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS' SURGE LETS BUTLER TAKE A SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent offensive surge from second baseman Delino DeShields "absolutely" 
made it easier for the Dodgers to give Brett Butler a rare day out of the 
starting lineup, according to coach Reggie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler was replaced in center field for only the fifth time this season by 
Raul Mondesi, with Mitch Webster playing left and Cory Snyder stepping into 
Mondesi's regular right-field spot. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, batting .359 since his return from the disabled list June 20, 
replaced Butler at the top of the batting order. DeShields was originally 
slated to bat leadoff when he was acquired in a trade from Montreal last winter 
before several injuries slowed him from the beginning of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brett wants to play every day, but he was struggling a little, his average 
was coming down (to .317 before the game), and it's better for him and the team 
to recharge the batteries," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the ideal situation would be for Butler, 36, to take a day off 
every 10 games or so. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a day off here and there, it'll be easier for him to build it back up," 
Smith said. "And he will build it back up." 
</P>
<P>
 When told that he would be out of the lineup, Butler discussed the decision 
with Manager Tom Lasorda and Smith for 45 minutes "before I said it's OK," 
Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just call it a day off," Butler said. "A little mental relaxation." TIM

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SMITH NOTICES A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole outfielder Dwight Smith was not intentionally trying to be 
critical of the Angel organization Friday, and he harbors no ill feelings, but 
he can't believe the enormous disparity between the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, there's a big difference between this team and that one," Smith 
said, "and I'm not just talking about the records. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we lose a game here, everyone knows why we lost. No one accepts losing. 
You've got to win right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over there, you don't feel the same way. It's a young team, and you always 
have alibis when you lose. To me, it's a refreshing change. I'm 30 years old, 
I've got to win right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who was traded June 14 for a minor league prospect, says his only 
regret is the Angels gave up on him too soon. He believes he could have helped 
the Angels stay in contention, but instead lost his platoon job when they made 
Jim Edmonds the everyday left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any bitter feelings," Smith said, "but it hurt. I was looking to 
be a big part of the organization. I was hoping they'd have patience with me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's greatest disappointment Friday was being told that the Orioles had the 
wrong information on the Angels' starting rotation. Somehow, the Orioles got 
the impression that Joe Grahe was starting, even though he hasn't started a 
game since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in today doing cartwheels," Smith said, "not because (Grahe) is a bad 
pitcher, but because he's a right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh well, I'll sit back and root my team on for three days, and then start 
pulling for the Angels again. I just want a half-share if they win it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Harold Reynolds, who sources say probably will be released if 
the Angels are unable to trade him by the time they recall Eduardo Perez at the 
All-Star break, was in the starting lineup instead of Damion Easley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Easley recently was criticized for his lack of discipline at the 
plate -- batting .199 since April 19 -- Manager Marcel Lachemann said he wanted 
Reynolds in the lineup because of his career .625 batting average against 
Oriole starter Mike Mussina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have been shopping Reynolds for weeks, but the Seattle Mariners, 
who previously expressed interest in Reynolds, may now go in a different 
direction. The Mariners are talking about moving shortstop Felix Fermin to 
second base at the All-Star break, and bringing up 19-year-old Alex Rodriguez, 
their No. 1 pick last season, to be their shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Designated hitter Chili Davis returned to the lineup after sitting out the 
last three games with a strained groin, and promptly hit his 14th homer of the 
season. "He makes a big difference in our lineup, obviously," Lachemann said. . 
. . Oriole Manager Johnny Oates was ejected in the fourth inning by home-plate 
umpire Terry Craft for arguing a called third strike on left fielder Brady 
Anderson. . . . When catcher Greg Myers threw out Mike Devereaux attempting to 
steal second in the third inning, it was only the ninth time this season the 
Orioles have been caught stealing. The Angels, in contrast, lead the major 
leagues, having been caught stealing 40 times. BOB NIGHTENGALE

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MCDOWELL STOPS BREWERS, 8-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack McDowell pitched a seven-hit shutout and Julio Franco had five runs 
batted in to lead the White Sox to an 8-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at 
Chicago on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco went two for four with a two-run home run, a two-run single and a 
run-scoring groundout. He has 71 RBIs this season, matching his career high. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell (5-7), who walked one and struck out four in his second consecutive 
complete game, was aided by Darrin Jackson's catch to rob Greg Vaughn of a 
grand slam in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 A home run would have given the Brewers a 4-1 lead, but the inning ended with 
the score 1-0. After that, McDowell got stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got back into the flow after (Jackson's catch), that was a big play," said 
McDowell, who after starting the season 2-7 is 3-0 with a 2.44 earned run 
average in his last six starts. "Early on, I wasn't 100% comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 4, New York 3 -- Ken Griffey drove in the winning run with a 
ninth-inning single and Jay Buhner ended the game with a great running catch 
for the Mariners at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey ripped Steve Howe's pitch toward second baseman Dave Silvestri, who 
failed to get in front of the ball. It went into right field, scoring Rich 
Amaral. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Ayala (3-1) got the victory despite allowing the Yankees to tie the 
score in the eighth inning. Xavier Hernandez (3-4) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill, whose average had dipped to a season-low .365, ended an 0-for-16 
slump with a pinch-hit single. Seattle starter Randy Johnson struck out 12 in 6 
1/3 innings and Dan Wilson drove in two runs for the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 6, Minnesota 1 -- Jack Morris pitched a four-hitter for his 251st 
victory and Eddie Murray hit his 453rd home run, at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris (7-5) struck out six, walked none and retired 18 of the last 19 batters 
he faced in his first complete-game victory since Aug. 1. He improved to 6-1 in 
10 starts since he shaved his mustache to change his luck following a May 9 
loss at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's two-run home run in the second inning, his 12th, moved him past Carl 
Yastrzemski into 19th place on the career list. It was also his 2,900th hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 6, Boston 3 -- The resurgent Athletics won their eighth consecutive 
game, thanks to a five-run first inning and eight strong innings from Ron 
Darling at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Darling (6-9), who settled down after giving up a two-run homer to Mo Vaughn 
in the first inning, gave up five hits and retired the last 14 batters he 
faced. Dave Leiper and Dennis Eckersley pitched the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 4, Toronto 3 -- Brian McRae hit a two-out RBI single in the 12th 
inning to give the Royals a victory at Kansas City and hand the Blue Jays their 
12th loss in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 McRae's single was the third consecutive two-out hit in the 12th off Woody 
Williams (1-3), who pitched four innings of relief. Jeff Montgomery (2-3) 
pitched one-third of an inning for the win. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 10-8, Detroit 6-6 -- Juan Gonzalez hit a grand slam in the eighth 
inning, capping the Rangers' rally from a six-run deficit in the first game of 
a doubleheader at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, rookie Rusty Greer had a two-run homer and a two-run 
single that drove in the go-ahead run in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales hit the third grand slam of his career and 12th homer of the season. 
He has three homers and nine RBIs in his last four games.

 Score one for the Lakers in the early stages of the free-agent derby. Thursday 
night, at the moment teams were allowed to contact players and their 
representatives, Jerry West became the first person to call Jim Sexton, the 
agent for Horace Grant, the Chicago Bulls' power forward who is at or near the 
top of the Laker wish list.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; FRANKEL OUT TO REPEAT MAGIC IN THE GOLD CUP WITH FANMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is precedent for Fanmore to score an upset in the $750,000 Hollywood 
Gold Cup at Hollywood Park today. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, trainer Bobby Frankel won the meeting's biggest race with a 
turf horse who was switching to the main track when 27-1 shot Marquetry beat 
favored Farma Way after a memorable stretch duel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is the longest shot in the field at 8-1 in the morning line, 
Fanmore's price won't approach that of Marquetry's in 1991. There is another 
difference too. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquetry had run on the main track before his Gold Cup victory, whereas 
Fanmore will be making his dirt debut, after 12 races on turf in England, 
France and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Juddmonte Farms, which also had Marquetry when he won the Gold Cup, 
Fanmore has been a model of consistency. He has won six times and run second 
five times, and the only time he was off the board he was a troubled fourth in 
the Citation Handicap at Hollywood Park on Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel, who has been successful with other horses moving from grass to dirt, 
decided to give the 6-year-old Lear Fan gelding a shot in the 1 1/4-mile Gold 
Cup when he saw how small the field was going to be. Only eight horses were 
nominated and only five are expected to run today. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get $18,750 for running fifth and $56,250 for fourth and if he beats two 
horses, he gets $112,500," Frankel said. "The race is worth $550,000 more (than 
Monday's American Handicap, for which Fanmore also was nominated) and he has to 
run against four horses as opposed to maybe 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a better horse (than Marquetry)," Frankel said. "I don't know how he's 
going to run on dirt, but I like this horse better. He tries hard every time he 
goes out there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some nice horses (in the Gold Cup), but I don't see any superstars 
and some of them aren't coming in off their best races." 
</P>
<P>
 After surprising Bien Bien in the San Luis Obispo Handicap at Santa Anita on 
Feb. 21, Fanmore suffered a twisted ankle. According to Frankel, it took longer 
than expected for the gelding to lose his soreness, and he didn't return to the 
races until June 18 at Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-10 favorite in the 1 3/8-mile Golden Gate Handicap, Fanmore lost by half 
a length to Alex The Great. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the time off, Frankel was happy with the effort and expects the 
gelding to improve. What remains to be seen is how he will adapt to the dirt. 
One thing in his favor is the outside post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like my post," Frankel said. "From the outside, my rider (Corey Nakatani) 
can see what happens inside of him and (Fanmore) should be able to avoid 
getting dirt in his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's coming up to the race fine and he's trained very well on dirt. It's a 
good opportunity to try him on the main track, and he's got the right style for 
it. He's a game, steady-running horse, and that's what you need." 
</P>
<P>
 Consideration had been given to running Fanmore in the Caesars International 
last Sunday at Atlantic City, a race Lure won in a photo finish over Fourstars 
Allstar. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision was made to have Fanmore return in the Golden Gate Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sorry I got beat (at Golden Gate) and, after watching (the Caesars 
International) I was sorry I didn't go there. The way things have happened, 
maybe the gods are pointing me in the direction of this race," Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fanmore isn't the longshot at post time, Del Mar Dennis will be. The 
4-year-old Dixieland Band gelding, who had scored three consecutive victories, 
among them stakes triumphs in the Mervyn LeRoy and San Bernardino, finished 
fifth of seven in the Californian, nine lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Gonzalez Jr. has been Del Mar Dennis' rider in all eight of his starts, 
but there had been discussion about a jockey change for the Gold Cup. However, 
Gonzalez, the nephew of trainer Paco Gonzalez, will be aboard this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 His handlers want Del Mar Dennis to stay closer to the pace than he was in the 
Californian, and his No. 1 post dictates that he do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, I like the one hole because it means we've got to go for it and 
show some speed," said John Toffan, who owns the horse in partnership with 
Trudy McCaffery. "I don't think we'll have a lot of decisions to make from in 
there." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat, who beat Flawlessly in their first meeting in the Gamely 
Handicap on June 12, will try for a repeat in the $300,000 Beverly Hills 
Handicap on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Eclipse Award winners, each of whom will carry 124 pounds, are 
expected to be joined by five other fillies and mares in the 1 1/8-mile turf 
race, the same distance as the Gamely. 
</P>
<P>
 The five others entered Friday were Zoonaqua; Potridee; Mz. Zill Bear, the 
runner-up in the Gamely; Empress Club, who is also entered in an easier spot in 
today's second race, and Corrazona. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 First post today is noon. The Gold Cup will be the third race with a scheduled 
post time of 1:05 p.m. and it will be televised locally -- delayed -- by ESPN. 
. . . Besides winning with Marquetry in 1991, trainer Bobby Frankel has been 
second in the Gold Cup the last two years. Marquetry finished behind Sultry 
Song in 1992 and a year ago, Bertrando was second to Best Pal. . . . In the two 
other stakes races on today's card, Argolid is the 5-2 favorite in the $163,600 
Affirmed Handicap at 1 1/8 miles and Memo is the 2-1 morning-line choice in the 
$108,400 Triple Bend Handicap at seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park will also offer betting on the $150,000 Bowling Green Handicap 
from Belmont Park between the third and fourth races. . . . Laffit Pincay will 
be at Churchill Downs today to ride the highly regarded Timber County for 
trainer Wayne Lukas in the $100,000 Bashford Manor. 
</P>
<P>
 Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Cardmania is back in trainer Derek Meredith's barn 
and it is hoped the 8-year-old gelding will return to the races this fall. 
Cardmania, the last horse to finish in front of The Wicked North when he won 
the San Carlos in January, suffered a broken left hind cannon bone while 
preparing for the San Antonio Handicap in February.

LAST 2 DEFENDANTS IN TAY SLAYING FOUND GUILTY; COURTS: O.C. TEENS KIRN KIM AND 
ABRAHAM ACOSTA ARE CONVICTED OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. LIFE TERMS ARE POSSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Orange County teen-agers were found guilty Friday of first-degree murder 
in a 1992 New Year's Eve slaying that gained nationwide attention as a 
troubling portrait of youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirn Kim, 18, and Abraham Acosta, 17, were the last of five youths convicted 
in the killing of Stuart A. Tay, a 17-year-old high school honor student from 
Orange who aspired to be a doctor like his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim had acted as lookout while the others lured Tay to the back yard of 
Acosta's Buena Park home. Acosta leveled the first of many blows to Tay's body 
with a baseball bat. They bludgeoned him and buried him there in a shallow 
grave. 
</P>
<P>
 The five teens, most of them college-bound students at Sunny Hills High School 
in Fullerton, wanted Tay dead because they believed he was about to 
double-cross them in a planned heist of computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said Friday that the case left them emotionally drained, and they 
expressed concern for the families of Tay and the five assailants who were 
caught up in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very difficult case for all of us," jury forewoman Wilma Johnson 
said. "Our sympathies and hearts go out to all the members of all the families 
on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of lives hurt," said juror Jennifer Baker, who wept as the 
verdicts were read. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim closed his eyes tight and blinked several times as the jury announced the 
guilty verdict that could send him to prison for 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta sat quietly at the defense table until Orange County Superior Court 
Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary began discussing sentencing. That's when Acosta broke 
down, sobbing loudly as defense attorney Denise Gragg put a comforting arm 
around his shoulder. The judge ordered the courtroom cleared of spectators, but 
Acosta's cries could still be heard in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to convicting both youths of first-degree murder, jurors also 
found that Acosta had ambushed his victim -- a so-called special-circumstance 
finding that means he faces the prospect of life in prison with no parole. But 
they rejected a second special-circumstance charge that the killing had been 
for financial gain when Acosta pocketed $100 from Tay's wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also acquitted Kim of the special-circumstance allegation that he had 
ambushed his victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution said both Kim and Acosta joined in plotting the killing, 
joining a dress rehearsal with their friends, helping dig the grave in advance 
and agreeing to dump the victim's car in Compton to make the killing look like 
a carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay, a student at Foothill High School in Santa Ana, was beaten in Acosta's 
garage with bats and a sledgehammer. When he did not die immediately, the 
youths forced him to drink rubbing alcohol and taped his nose and mouth shut 
before he was buried in a shallow grave that had been dug 24 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Tay, the victim's mother, said outside of court Friday that she is not 
fully satisfied by the verdicts. She said she could not understand why jurors 
did not conclude Kim was guilty of lying-in-wait for the victim or why Acosta 
was not convicted of killing for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know he did dig the grave the day before," Linda Tay said of Kim. 
"Certainly, it was well planned ahead of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The sophisticated murder scheme and the sheer senselessness of the killing 
grabbed headlines from the start. But the case also shocked Orange County 
because the assailants and the victim were such unlikely suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them did well in school. The teen-agers spent their time cruising 
fast-food restaurants, doing homework and playing computer games. They decided 
to hatch the murder plot because they feared that Tay was going to double-cross 
them in a computer rip-off. 
</P>
<P>
 The ringleader was Robert Chan, 19, of Fullerton, a one-time candidate for 
valedictorian, who was convicted in a separate trial in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay was a high-achieving honor student. But Tay also had another side to him, 
one that was intrigued with crime and gangs and liked to brag about involvement 
in spy networks and underworld activities. The talk was designed to impress 
those around him -- there was no evidence Tay was involved in criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay took on an alias and claimed he was much older when he sought out Chan. 
The two hatched a plan to rob an Anaheim computer-parts dealer and recruited 
the four remaining teens to carry out the scheme, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chan discovered Tay was lying about his age and name, Chan decided to 
kill Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness was Charles Choe, 18, of Fullerton, who pleaded 
guilty to first-degree murder for his role in the attack. In return for his 
testimony against his former co-defendants, Choe was prosecuted as a juvenile. 
The other teens were prosecuted as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum told jurors that the five teens were all 
fully involved with planning and carrying out the murder scheme. But defense 
attorneys for Kim and Acosta had argued to jurors that Chan duped their clients 
into participating in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Gragg presented evidence that Acosta is a mentally 
disabled youth who was easily led to believe that he was to strike Tay as part 
of a teen-age prank to scare the victim -- not kill him. The blow did little 
more than anger Tay, who was then knocked unconscious when Chan took over the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Allan H. Stokke told jurors that his client also was unaware 
that a murder was underway.  
</P>
<P>
 Acosta's mother avoided reporters after Friday's hearing. Sook Kim, Kirn Kim's 
mother, told reporters that she and her son pray daily for Stuart Tay and his 
family but said Robert Chan is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a victim of Robert Chan," she said of her son. "The only thing 
different is he is alive. We will be praying for Stuart Tay and family for the 
rest of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Tay said she wants the young men who killed her son to be sentenced to 
the maximum sentence under law. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother said that even though she sat through nearly every moment of the 
trials in the case, she wonders if she will ever understand how her son could 
have been murdered.  
</P>
<P>
 "But how do you understand kids that want to take another life?" The Tay 
Conspiracy 
</P>
<P>
 Five Sunny Hills High School teen-agers plotted the murder of honor student 
Stuart Tay, even having a dress rehearsal hours before his murder on New Year's 
Eve, 1992. Afterward, the youths agreed to ditch Tay's car in Compton, hoping 
to mislead police into believing Tay was the victim of a random carjacking.

REPAIRING THAT WHICH THEY DESTROYED; ECOLOGY: COSTA RICA COLONISTS TORE OUT THE 
TREES TO PUT IN FARMS. NOW, A UCI PROFESSOR AND OTHERS REVERSE HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The rain came. It hammered the earth and thrashed the trees, tunneled the soil 
and etched wrinkles in hands. And still the drops kept falling. 
</P>
<P>
 So wet was the immense emerald rain forest of the southern Costa Rican 
frontier that sometimes it seemed to an expatriate Southern Californian like 
Darryl Cole that there was no sun -- only rain falling and dusk. 
</P>
<P>
 In the green darkness of smothering leaves, there was nothing -- remembered 
Cole -- more satisfying than taking an ax to free sunlight from the trees. Now, 
these are the giants that he seeks to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four decades since the first ax felled a tree in Coto Brus on Feb. 28, 
1952, many of the settlers who participated in what was called " La Conquista 
de la Selva " -- the conquest of the jungle -- have developed a special 
reverence for an old arch enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some seasoned pioneers have planted seeds of a new forest or joined the effort 
with UC Irvine Prof. Frances Lynn Carpenter, who is searching for new, rapid 
strategies to raise up a rain forest from battered lands on the edge of the 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter says she has glimpsed signs of this changing attitude among local 
farmers, who are cautiously planting seedlings on portions of their land. The 
problem, she says, is that the strategies are often haphazard because there is 
little information about the fastest, sturdiest and most valuable trees to 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Several farmers have created their own tiny rain forest preserves, a patch of 
nostalgia to remember the land when it was covered with a canopy of trees 
inhabited by long-beaked toucans, wild pigs and jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
 Others just try to make sense of the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have acted upon scant knowledge," Cole writes forlornly of the triumph 
over the rain forests. "The new pioneer is the researcher. He or she must deal 
with the burden which has been brought forward. For we have loved yet 
despoiled; labored yet destroyed; cherished yet all but lost a world which we 
must now seek to re-create and restore. This is the frontier." 
</P>
<P>
 Coto Brus -- a canton, or county, near the border of Panama -- was the 
frontier, a land of instant history that took only 40 years for settlers to 
transform more than 25,000 acres of remote, mist-shadowed rain forest into a 
leading coffee-growing region of Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 The early settlement was an island in a rain forest. To the east was Panama. 
To the north, the mountains of the Cordillera Talamanca. To the west, nothing 
but trees as far as the eye could linger. Within the first 20 years, almost 70% 
of the forest disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 That history is memorialized in the town square of San Vito by a rusting, 
flaking jeep and a towering statue of a pioneer with machete clutched in his 
stone hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The jeep is the carcass of the first vehicle that the settlers used to wrest a 
road from the dense rain forests. The machete was the tool that was standard 
apparel for the waves of 20th Century frontiersmen who flocked there from 
northern Costa Rica, Yugoslavia, the United States and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapid development in the isolated region was spurred by a wealthy family from 
Northern Italy, who formed an Italian colonization society that signed a 
contract in 1951 to provide settlers for the Costa Rican government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the yeast that formed the bread," insisted the founding patriarch of 
the colony, Vito Sansonetti, who in his 70s still speaks Spanish with a lilting 
Italian accent and savors his nickname, "Il Commandante. " 
</P>
<P>
 While a young naval officer, he had fallen in love with a Costa Rican woman 
while his Italian cruiser, " Duque de Aosta, " was docked in Panama. After 
their marriage, Sansonetti and his father -- an admiral in the Italian navy -- 
hatched a grand plan to create an Italian colony in Costa Rica with $4 million 
in funding raised by the sale of securities in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the Sansonetti family would persuade 117 families to emigrate. 
Some of the settlers had worked on the Sansonetti's Italian estate. Others were 
seeking adventure and money. And a few were fleeing political vengeance and 
assassination attempts for support of Italian fascism. 
</P>
<P>
 Even fewer were actually farmers with any agricultural training. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many of the young men who battled the forest are pensioners with time 
to reflect about how it came to pass that the rain forest vanished before their 
lives. Often their children and grandchildren listen to the explanations in 
silence, interrupting only to observe: It was a different time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sansonetti, who still owns a finca , or farm, that he has planted with new 
pines, blames the rapid destruction on Costa Rican squatters, who followed the 
Italians to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Francisco Cedeno, a Costa Rican pioneer who has maintained a rain 
forest preserve on his farm, blames the Italians for inexperience and lack of 
farming background. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernan Villalobos, the son of Costa Rican pioneers who is active in local 
farming and reforestation projects, simply blames old-fashioned hostility 
toward wild and hostile nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask now why we took down the trees," Villalobos said. "We didn't know 
what else to do. There were no controls and there was almost a competition 
among the men about who could cut down the trees the fastest. I remember how it 
used to make my mother really nervous when they were cutting them down. My 
brother was smaller and so she would take him and hug him while they were 
working. You could feel the trees shaking the earth as they fell."  
</P>
<P>
 When Villalobos was a child, nature was a force to conquer. The primeval 
forest was a sinister and mysterious place that harbored danger in the 
slithering form of snakes and the buzz of exotic insects. Young girls were 
warned they could be assaulted by monkeys if they strayed into the forest. 
Jaguars lurked in shadows.  
</P>
<P>
 And so, the frontiersmen challenged the forest with military-like precision. 
Sansonetti's 8-millimeter home movies of the expedition portray pioneers 
charging through the forest in a convoy of WWII vintage Jeeps with flags 
whipping in the wind. An Italian priest offers a blessing for their adventure.  
</P>
<P>
 Fear wasn't the only motive for the destruction of the forest. Government 
policies encouraged the clearing of the land for agriculture. Population 
pressures pushed squatters into virgin territory. Most of the rain forest in 
Costa Rica was not cut for timber production, but to make way for coffee 
plantations, farms and cattle pastures. 
</P>
<P>
 The timber markets were inaccessible to the settlers because the major road 
was often muddy and impassable during the storms that annually pelted the land 
with more than 130 inches of rain. Pioneers like Cole -- who migrated at age 20 
from Oceanside to Costa Rica -- helped clear the darkness of the forest, 
leaving the huge trunks to rot where they fell because they were worthless or 
too waterlogged to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the men, the forest was something to conquer," said Cole, 60, who lives 
in a two-story frame farmhouse with a sweeping view of a private rain forest 
preserve set aside on his farm. A small strip of carefully manicured grass 
separates the shiny black rocking chairs on the wide porch from the edge of the 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an opportunity to go out and to take tools in hand and do something," 
Cole said. "There were a few settlers who would look at it as an adventure, but 
it also embodied something else. It was an obstacle, a proving ground, a place 
where each settler could prove his worth. The forest was strong, something to 
overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Those historic attitudes -- that a wild and savage land full of untapped 
wealth was waiting to be tapped -- has evolved as the forest has dwindled in 
Coto Brus. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people are trying cautiously on their own to plant more trees, but there 
isn't widespread knowledge about what are the best strategies. Currently, the 
rate of reforestation in Costa Rica amounts to about 40,000 acres annually, 
according to Enrique Barrau, an agricultural expert with U.S. Aid for 
International Development. He expects the figures could increase even more if 
export restrictions were removed on Costa Rican timber, raising the value of 
growing trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Several university studies have tracked the progress of the colony, including 
one that examined the attitudes of first generation colonists and their 
children. The first generation settlers regretted the destruction of the 
forest, according to a study by Miguel Alexiades, but largely because they 
considered nature a commodity. Rising timber prices meant their capital had 
been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, according to the study, the second generation of colonists who 
were largely professionals in fields of law, agronomy and medicine were more 
aware of conservation and bemoaned the destruction of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlo Sansonetti -- a biologist and Catholic priest who is the nephew of the 
Italian colony's founder -- has purchased a 175-acre farm in the village of El 
Ceibo where he is launching a program to rehabilitate young men with drug 
addictions. Part of that rehabilitation also involves restoring the land. The 
men are expected to help with reforestation experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 But conservation is not the exclusive preserve of the second generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole has torn out the coffee plants on his farm and freed his lands for 
scientific research. He is now working with scientists from Cornell University 
and the University of Costa Rica, who have created experimental plots to test 
soil treatments and trees that can nourish the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also assisting Carpenter, who is trying to raise a new rain forest from 
63 acres in degraded pastureland south of Coto Brus. She is also examining the 
attitudes and practices that led to the deforestation and deterioration of her 
own land. 
</P>
<P>
 Her search has taken her to the hardware store of a local businessman who 
vaguely remembers the cutting of the forest 40 years ago to a farmhand who 
recalls the herbicides that ruined a coffee plantation that dotted her land. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also interviewed farmers like Miguel Sandi, a Costa Rican whose life 
has been dramatically affected by the changing views of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 His farm and apple orchards lie deep in the interior of an international 
forest preserve that straddles the Panamanian and Costa Rican border. He 
established title to the land as a squatter, clearing the trees to prove his 
claim. He still carries a bullet in his pale leg -- a constant reminder of 
ancient squabbles over the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, his wife was home alone in the house when an expedition from Canada, 
the United States and Europe came visiting to inquire about buying the farm 
that he had cultivated for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted the land, Sandi said, to restore that section of the park to 
pristine condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will go," he said, "but only if they can pay me for all the years of my 
struggle."

SALSA STARTS SEASON BY LOSING TO COLORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Salsa opened this American Professional Soccer League season the way it 
ended the last one -- with a loss to the Colorado Foxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's Jeff Hooker scored two minutes into overtime Friday to give the 
Foxes a 2-1 victory over the Salsa at Denver's Mile High Stadium.Colorado won 
the 1993 APSL title with a 3-1 victory over the Salsa at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa scored first when Jose Vasquez kicked in a rebound of a shot by 
Arturo Velazco that hit the crossbar in the 14th minute. Eleven minutes later, 
Colorado goalkeeper Jim St. Andre made a save on a penalty kick by the Salsa's 
Paulinho, the '92 APSL most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's Anthony McGreath scored just before halftime to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning goal was set up by Chad Ashton's free kick. Hooker controlled the 
rebound and scored. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first game as coach for Rick Davis, who also is the team's general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the result, it was a good start to our 1994 season," Davis said. "I'm 
happy about our overall performance, but we still have a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa and the Foxes play at Mile High Stadium again next Friday.

LOCAL NOTES: CS FULLERTON TO SETTLE WITH NINE WRESTLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton has agreed to pay nine members of the wrestling team a 
total of about $25,000 in financial aid because the school failed to follow 
NCAA guidelines when cutting their grants for the 1992-93 and 1993-94 school 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Each case was heard individually by a committee from the Financial Aid Office 
after the students complained and asked for hearings. The committee agreed that 
the university had failed to notify the student-athletes in writing by July 1 
of each year as specified by NCAA requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrestlers have been notified by mail of their awards, which vary with each 
individual, according to Jerry Keating, Fullerton's director of public affairs.

 The Mighty Ducks' Jarrod Skalde and Trevor Halverson were among 108 NHL 
players who became eligible for free agency Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Skalde, a 23-year-old center, had nine points in 20 games for the Ducks and 63 
points in 57 games for the San Diego Gulls of the International Hockey League. 
The Ducks can retain Skalde if they match another team's contract offer. If he 
signs with another team, the Ducks would be entitled to compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Halverson, a 23-year-old left wing who had 13 points in 58 games for the 
Gulls, did not play a game for the Ducks. Halverson is an unrestricted free 
agent, free to sign with any team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Karun Grossman, a 6-foot forward from Dana Hills High who averaged 23.5 points 
and 10.9 rebounds last season, has accepted a financial aid package to attend 
Harvard. Grossman, a Times All-County selection, led the county in 
three-pointers with 62. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Nick Estrada, a former Orange High outfielder, has signed a letter of intent 
with the University of San Francisco, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada, who also played basketball for the Panthers, batted .426 last season. 
He was selected first-team All-Orange League as a junior and senior.

BLESZYNSKI COURTING A RELAPSE; OLYMPIC FESTIVAL: WORN DOWN BY THREE EVENTS LAST 
YEAR, SHE COMES BACK FOR MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Tennis players who win at the U.S. Olympic Festival are asking for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The top players often end up playing two, sometimes three matches a day as 
mixed doubles is followed by singles competition, which is followed by regular 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 The more you win, the more you play, leaving precious little rest for the 
weary. 
</P>
<P>
 Ania Bleszynski learned that lesson the hard way last year when the heat and 
humidity of San Antonio, Tex., left her wilted in the medal rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Well Ania, welcome to the St. Louis area. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures that soared into the high 90s with humidity to match greeted 
Bleszynski, 17, when the Festival opened Friday with mixed doubles at the 
Dwight Davis Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But apparently Bleszynski is a glutton for punishment. She teamed with Mark 
Loughrin of Greendale, Wis., to down Laura Guignon of St. Louis and Jordan Wile 
of Long Island, N.Y., 6-1, 3-6, 6-1, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski, from Thousand Oaks, plays mixed doubles and singles today as the 
Festival gets underway in earnest with competition in archery, basketball, 
bowling, boxing, canoe and kayak racing, diving, equestrian, field hockey, ice 
skating, roller skating, shooting, soccer, softball, swimming, team handball 
and wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski and 88 other athletes from the Valley and Ventura County regions 
are among the more than 3,000 participants scheduled to take part in 
competition that runs through July 10 at venues in and around St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six states -- California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and 
Texas -- boast larger contingents. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, field hockey accounts for the largest group of local athletes. Of 
the 60 players split into four teams, 23 are from Ventura County and another is 
from Northridge. When the South plays the West on Tuesday, 20 of the 30 players 
in uniform will be from the Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Vargas, reigning U.S. amateur lightweight boxing champion, and former 
Olympians Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Alice Brown, Victoria Herazo, Mohammed Barakat 
and David Spaulding are the top names in the local contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, 16, from Oxnard, is the youngest boxer in the field of 48 combatants. 
He will face Salvador Jasso of Los Angeles in his opening bout on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee, from Canoga Park, and Alice Brown, a former Cal State 
Northridge teammate of Kersee's, are scheduled to run the 100 meters a week 
from today. 
</P>
<P>
 Herazo, from Valencia, is set to compete in the 10,000-meter walk on Friday. 
Spaulding, who learned to paddle in Ventura Harbor, will race this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Also starting competition today are archers Mark Hainline and Justin Huish of 
Simi Valley and Teri Chang of Northridge; canoe racers Joe Harper and Jim 
Werland of Ventura; divers Nancy Janik and Ricky Wood of Simi Valley; roller 
skater Jill Moreno of Oxnard, and swimmers John Jenkins of La Crescenta, Nicole 
Beck, Rebecca Gilman and Mandy Walz of Ventura, Jennifer Parmenter of Granada 
Hills and Erin Schatz of Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the athletes in team sports are handball players Denny Fercho and Jim 
Hop of Camarillo, James Cox of Ventura, Tim Flaherty of Simi Valley and Mike 
Hurdle of Reseda. In softball are former Glendale High slugger Jenny Dalton, 
former Hoover High All-American pitcher Nancy Evans, former Burbank High and 
UCLA All-American Shelia Cornell, former Thousand Oaks High volleyball and 
softball standout Amy Chellevold, former Northridge All-American outfielders 
Barbara Jordan and Priscilla Rouse, plus Barb Booth of Glendale and infielder 
Karen Walker of El Camino Real High and UCLA.

CONVAIR PLANT IN SAN DIEGO TO CLOSE BY 1996; MANUFACTURING: MOVE WILL END 1,900 
JOBS AND THE CITY'S LONG TRADITION OF BUILDING PLANES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Dynamics Corp. announced Friday that its Convair Division will stop 
making commercial jetliner fuselages by the end of 1995, eliminating 1,900 jobs 
and marking the end of the company's long history in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas mutually agreed to terminate Convair's 
contract to provide fuselages for the 300-seat MD-11 airliner. Manufacturing 
responsibility will be transferred to McDonnell Douglas, which has said it will 
not preserve the operation in San Diego. General Dynamics had tried for two 
years to sell the Convair unit, but the effort ultimately failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The termination of the contract will mean the end of the Convair Division and 
of General Dynamics' presence in San Diego, as well as the city's long 
aircraft-building tradition. The defense contractor once employed 18,000 people 
here but sold its missiles division to Hughes Aircraft in 1991 and its Atlas 
rocket operation to Martin Marietta earlier this year. Both moved the units 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending the contract enables McDonnell Douglas to take over the business 
without assuming responsibility for Convair employees and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 General Dynamics has been reducing its operations in San Diego since it 
announced in 1989 that it would abandon all defense markets it did not 
dominate. The company began making aircraft here in 1935 with amphibious 
airplanes and continued with B-24 bombers during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to now, the massive MD-11 fuselages have been made at the Convair plant 
near Lindbergh Field and then shipped by barge up the coast for final assembly 
at Douglas Aircraft's Long Beach facility. The announcement ends two years of 
limbo for the Convair employees, who knew the parent company was trying to 
unload the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the International Assn. of Machinists union local representing 
Convair workers were not available for comment late Friday. McDonnell Douglas 
said it has made no decision on where the fuselages will be made once it takes 
over production. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at any and all cities," a spokesman said. "The only thing we 
can say is it won't be in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 General Dynamics has delivered about 120 of the 200 fuselages called for in 
its contract and will ramp up production to deliver most if not all of the 80 
remaining in its contract over the next 18 months.

TRW CONTRACT ON SPY SATELLITE VOIDED BY GAO; AEROSPACE: LOCKHEED, MARTIN 
MARIETTA HAD ACCUSED FIRM OF LOW-BALLING BID. NOW THEY ALL MUST SUBMIT NEW 
ONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TRW won a top-secret, multibillion-dollar contract to build a new spy 
satellite fleet earlier this year, but the General Accounting Office has ruled 
that the contract must be put up for bid again because Lockheed and Martin 
Marietta protested the award. 
</P>
<P>
 If TRW is unsuccessful in winning the contract a second time, it would forgo 
revenues estimated at more than $5 billion and halt the creation of more than 
1,000 jobs in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly why the GAO, which has the authority to hear such protests, recently 
ordered the rebidding remains unclear, but the protesting firms had claimed 
that TRW submitted an unrealistically low bid, industry sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is being hotly contested largely because the military space industry 
is facing a painful dearth of new orders, and the losers may eventually be 
forced out of the military spacecraft business. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for TRW, Lockheed, Martin and the Pentagon declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to reverse the large award is highly unusual. Defense industry 
experts could not recall a similar case in recent years, despite the fact that 
numerous protests have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract was awarded by the National Reconnaissance Office, an independent 
federal agency that acts as the procurement arm for spy satellites used by the 
military services and the Central Intelligence Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite, known either by the designation 7795 or P-81, would use an 
advanced radar system to search the skies for enemy combat jets as well as 
other targets on the ground. It would succeed an earlier generation of 
satellites produced by TRW and Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the program, as well as its very existence, is classified, but 
defense industry experts estimate the design and production would cost roughly 
$5 billion to $10 billion over eight to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how quickly that money was spent, the program might employ 
roughly 1,000 to 2,000 people. TRW would build the satellite in Redondo Beach. 
Lockheed would conduct its work in Sunnyvale, Calif., and Martin in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 For TRW, the program is crucial to its future as a military satellite 
producer, said John Pike, a space expert at the Federation of American 
Scientists. Pike speculated that both Martin Marietta and Hughes Aircraft have 
assured futures in the industry, but Lockheed and TRW are fighting hard for a 
place amid rapid consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, TRW, Lockheed and Aerojet became embroiled in another nasty battle 
over a spy satellite system, known as the Follow-on Early Warning Satellite, 
which was eventually canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The reversal puts TRW in an exceptionally awkward position, defense industry 
officials said. If TRW did low-ball the bid, it is not clear whether it can 
justify an even lower bid now. Meanwhile, Lockheed and Martin now know the 
price TRW offered to win the contract.

 The new satellite will use a so-called phased array radar, which has a radar

Such radars can identify and track targets more quickly and accurately.

FOOD 4 LESS WANTS INJUNCTION AGAINST LUCKY; SUPERMARKETS: IT WILL ASK THE 
COURTS TO PROHIBIT ITS RIVAL FROM CLAIMING TO BE THE 'LOW PRICE LEADER' AMONG 
GROCERY CHAINS. 
</P>

<P>
 As part of a novel and possibly precedent-setting attack on a competitor's 
pricing claims, Food 4 Less Stores plans to seek a court order Tuesday 
prohibiting Lucky Stores from calling itself the "low price leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Food 4 Less said they will amend a $100-million false-advertising 
lawsuit filed against Lucky in March by seeking an injunction that would bar 
Lucky from calling itself the "low price leader every day."  
</P>
<P>
 Food 4 Less contends that overall prices at its warehouse stores are lower 
than Lucky's and that the Lucky ads are therefore false. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said a lawsuit on price comparisons is virtually 
unprecedented in retailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Food 4 Less wins the suit, it could start a major trend in the industry," 
said Gary Giblen, a supermarket analyst at PaineWebber. "A number of retailers 
would begin to turn to the courts to resolve pricing issues and other 
disputes."  
</P>
<P>
 The litigation is the latest salvo in an escalating price war among 
supermarket chains in the Southland. Lucky, a subsidiary of Salt Lake 
City-based American Stores, operates 239 stores in Southern California. La 
Habra-based Food 4 Less runs 28 discount supermarkets under the Food 4 Less 
name in Southern California, and also operates 24 Boys, 15 Viva and 133 Alpha 
Beta stores in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute involves an advertising campaign Lucky launched in February, 1993, 
when it announced it was lowering prices on 2,500 items. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky spokeswoman Judy Decker said Lucky had compared its prices to those of 
Alpha Beta, Vons and Ralphs, but had never run ads comparing them to those at 
Food 4 Less warehouse stores. She also said the Lucky advertisements are based 
on a price survey conducted by an independent company four to five times a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We contend that their case is without merit, and we are confident that the 
integrity of our advertising will be upheld in court," Decker said. Lucky has 
asked the court to dismiss the suit, contending there is insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking the injunction, Food 4 Less says Lucky's allegedly false 
advertisements are hurting consumers.  
</P>
<P>
 "These unfair and anti-competitive practices must be stopped in that they not 
only affect the financial well-being of the marketplace by improperly 
destroying competition, but they also harm consumers throughout the state . . . 
and undermine the trust and confidence that the public places in the 
advertising of major supermarket chains," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henry Clark, a business ethics professor at USC, said Food 4 Less could 
benefit even if it loses the suit. "This is part of a (Food 4 Less) strategy to 
get more publicity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark added that the Southland's supermarket industry will monitor the legal 
dispute closely because a ruling could affect future advertising practices.

OFF THE TICKER: DOES IT COUNT IF THEY'RE GAP JEANS?

<P>
 For U.S. firms wondering how to keep workers happy, a study offers this 
advice: Let them wear jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide survey of white-collar workers found that 81% agree that 
allowing casual dress improves morale and 47% believe it improves productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all respondents, 96%, said they dress casually when they can. 
Eighty-four percent said jeans were acceptable in their offices. Asked if a 
casual dress policy could influence their decision in accepting a job offer, 
46% said it would. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of this wisdom? A telephone survey of 750 employees, commissioned 
by Levi Strauss & Co.

THE ROCKETS' RED TAPE; CREATORS OF FIREWORKS DISPLAYS SAY REGULATORY MAZE 
THREATENS THE INDUSTRY EVEN AS IT BOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pyro Spectaculars, a family-run business for four generations, is the kind of 
place where dress is casual, workers pool their lunch money, and the president 
of the company knows nearly all 75 employees by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed here in a modest blue and white stucco building and a few warehouses 
off a dusty road in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains, the display 
fireworks company is gearing up for its busiest season ever. On Monday, 500 
Pyro Spectaculars shows will light up skies from California to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the fireworks business is booming, an ever-growing maze of 
federal, state and local regulations threatens to drive away Pyro Spectacular's 
network of people licensed to put on the displays, company President Jim Souza 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be fun for them, but now these regulations are so much on them 
that some people say, 'It's just not worth it anymore,' " said Souza, whose 
great-grandfather founded the company at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only about 50 small display fireworks companies left in the country, 
said John Conklin, president of the American Pyrotechnic Institute in 
Chestertown, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current regulatory structure is a nightmare for small business," Conklin 
said. "Unless you have a minimum of one -- but it almost requires two or three 
-- people who are full-time regulatory compliance personnel, you cannot exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Pyro Spectaculars has acquired three smaller companies since the late 1980s, 
when the regulatory bad dream started to become a nightmare. Those companies, 
in Rialto, San Diego and Olympia, Wash., employ from five to a dozen people 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw that the writing was on the wall and that it would just get tougher 
and tougher for them," Souza said. "Next year, we'll have two full-time people 
dealing just with regulations. A five-person business can't afford that." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that the 12 government agencies that regulate Pyro 
Spectaculars and other display fireworks companies duplicate each other's 
functions, more than doubling the paperwork the company must file, said Dean 
Collister, Pyro Spectacular's vice president and regulatory point man. Not all 
of the agency's regulations are cumbersome or unnecessary, he said, it's just 
that there are so many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Collister keeps a three-page list of Pyro Spectacular's regulators pinned to a 
bulletin board in his office for easy referral. He also keeps a 10-inch-high 
pile of manuals handy for his quixotic quest to be in compliance with a dozen 
or so regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fines for noncompliance can run as high as $10,000, enough to swallow the 
profit of a small fireworks company, Conklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations cover the entire life of a fireworks shell, from its birth as 
gunpowder (its handling is regulated by local fire officials) until it bursts 
into the night sky (the pyrotechnic operator who lights it must have a license 
from the state). 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions for workers at the Rialto plant are regulated by federal and state 
agencies. The manufacture and storage of fireworks is regulated by the federal 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the state Fire Marshall, among 
other groups. Another agency requires an annual business plan. Local 
governments regulate the shows. And the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District issues a permit to burn waste. 
</P>
<P>
 For pyrotechnists -- fireworks operators who usually do a few shows a year -- 
regulatory compliance is also a problem. They usually carry their own materials 
and must comply with a U.S. Department of Transportation rule that classifies 
fireworks as hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyrotechnists thus need the same commercial license required to transport 
gasoline, propane and radioactive waste, Transportation Department spokeswoman 
Patricia Klinger said.  
</P>
<P>
 Getting a commercial driver's license requires a battery of tests and costs 
about $150. That's in addition to the $75 fee to become a licensed 
pyrotechnician. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'I'm making a couple hundred dollars shooting this display, and 
it's not worth it,' " Conklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that can threaten even relatively large companies such as Pyro 
Spectaculars, which depends on the licensed hobbyists to transport and stage 
shows throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Collister said Pyro Spectaculars is not against regulations that promote 
fireworks safety. "We're as concerned as anybody about safety," he said. "But 
it would be so much easier if they just got together and worked out one set of 
regulations."

 Cost of Funds Index Rises Again: The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
said the 11th District cost of funds, the rate to which many adjustable-rate 
mortgages are tied, climbed to 3.726% in May from 3.672% in April. It was the 
second straight monthly increase in the rate after a steady decline during the 
previous 3 1/2 years. The rate measures the average cost of funds to the 
thrifts and financial institutions in the bank's 11th District, which covers 
California, Arizona and Nevada.

 Safeco Withdraws From Homeowners Market: Following the lead of three other 
major insurers worried about earthquake risk, Safeco Corp. said its insurance 
subsidiaries would immediately stop writing new homeowners, dwelling fire and 
condominium policies in California.Safeco, with 259,000 such policies in force 
in California, is one of the state's 10 largest carriers. William E. Thomas, a 
Safeco senior vice president, noted in a statement that the company suffered an 
estimated $175 million in losses from the Northridge earthquake. In order to 
limit its exposure to such losses, Safeco must curtail its writings of 
homeowners coverage, because California law requires homeowners insurers to 
also offer earthquake coverage, Thomas said.

DOLLAR RISES; STOCKS UP IN LIGHT TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar rebounded against the Japanese yen Friday ahead of the long Fourth 
of July weekend, after slumping to a new post-World War II low in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The relative calm after several days of a dollar slide took pressure off 
stocks, which ended firmer. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 98.55 yen, up from 98.50 on Thursday. 
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar set a new low of 97.68 yen before closing at 98.78 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bank of Japan intervened to rescue the dollar as it set the postwar low 
against the yen in Tokyo. The aggressive buying of dollars by the Japanese 
central bank spearheaded a short-lived dollar rally as sellers rushed to take 
profits ahead of the three-day holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar ended at 1.596 German marks, up from 1.588 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.69 points to 
3,646.65, up 9.71 for the week. In the broader market, rising issues 
outnumbered decliners by about 8 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The trading volume on the Big Board was a scant 199.03 million shares, the 
second-lowest of the year, as investors declined to take positions before the 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a pre-holiday lull," said Douglas Myers, vice president of 
trading at Interstate/Johnson Lane. "Nobody is going to venture any bets." 
</P>
<P>
 All U.S. government offices, financial markets and commercial banks will be 
closed Monday for the Independence Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly small firms finished up 0.89 points at 
706.85 after being depressed for most of the session by weaker computer issues. 
The Nasdaq gained 13.06 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury market ended a volatile week on a quiet note, with the long 
bond's yield edging downward despite a fresh sign of potential inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year bond yield, which rose sharply Thursday, eased to 7.60% from 7.61% 
the day before. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, edged up 1/16 
point, or 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
4.25%, down from 10% on Thursday. The sharp jump Thursday was caused by 
seasonal bank activity at the end of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the release of several economic reports, only the June survey on 
corporate purchasing trends seemed to gain the attention of traders. 
</P>
<P>
 One report showed growth in manufacturing eased slightly at midyear, a 
government forecasting gauge signaled economic activity was shifting to a lower 
gear, and the National Assn. of Purchasing Management reported prices paid by 
industry rose at the fastest pace in nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
 That spurred fresh speculation that the Federal Open Market Committee, the 
Federal Reserve Board's policy-setting arm, will raise the federal funds rate 
at its meeting Tuesday. It would be the fifth rate hike since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlight's: 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM fell 1 3/4 to 57 and led the NYSE action in volume. After the market 
closed, Lehman Bros. downgraded the stock, saying revenue growth could slow. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft fell 1 1/4 to 50 1/4. Apple lost 3/4 to 25 3/4 and Dell slid 1 1/4 
to 25 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Circus Circus was the second-largest volume on the NYSE and rose 4 1/4 to 25 
3/4. The Wall Street Journal reported that Bally Entertainment is seeking 
federal antitrust clearance to purchase 25% of the gaming concern. Bally was up 
1/4 at 6 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other gaming stocks rose, including Caesars World, up 3 1/4 to 39 1/2, and 
Promus, up 1 3/8 to 31. 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS fell 6 to 307 after soaring 50 on Thursday after the network said it was 
merging with QVC. Merrill Lynch and Oppenheimer removed their "buy" ratings 
from CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alcoa was up 2 3/8 to 75 1/2 and International Paper added 1 1/2 at 67 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets closed mostly higher. London's Financial Times 100-share 
average ended up 17.2 points at 2,936.4, while in Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share 
average ended up 11.18 at 2,036.52, a gain of 40.54 over last Friday. Shares 
also closed higher in Paris. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average fell 100.52 
points to 20,543.41. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index closed with a slight gain of 0.07 point at 2,262.65.

SEC ASKS FOR QUERY INTO FUND REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission and members of Congress are asking the 
mutual fund industry to investigate problems with transmitting mutual fund 
prices to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry has responded with two initiatives of its own aimed at improving 
the process: extending a deadline for funds to report prices and examining 
other system improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue gained attention after Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the 
nation's leading mutual fund purveyor, last week admitted that on June 17 it 
sent out day-old prices for 150 of its 208 mutual funds to the National Assn. 
of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity said computer problems prevented it from properly calculating prices 
by the 5:30 p.m. EDT deadline for funds to report their prices to meet 
newspaper deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD, an industry self-policing organization, collects the data from funds 
and distributes it to companies and news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. asked the industry to provide an "assessment of 
the nature and extent of existing pricing problems in the mutual fund 
industry." On Thursday, Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) asked the SEC to 
investigate problems of distributing mutual fund prices to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD, which had already been upgrading the system, plans a new improvement 
by July 11: extending the deadline for funds to transmit their closing prices 
by 10 minutes to 5:40 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund industry had pushed for extending the deadline so fund data managers 
would have additional time to check the accuracy of the prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us the 10 minutes for them will mean a big difference," said James 
Spellman, an NASD spokesman. "It's a first step toward improving the mutual 
fund quotation service of the NASD." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the NASD is considering computer system improvements to speed the 
process, Spellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 One option is a new electronic link so funds can report prices to the industry 
group when they're ready. Under the current system, funds report prices in a 
single batch to the NASD. 
</P>
<P>
 The new transmission system would enable news organizations to provide several 
versions of mutual fund tables, presumably with the easiest-to-price funds 
reporting first and the more complex international funds, which take longer to 
price, reporting later.

U.S. TO ANTE $50 MILLION FOR FLAT-PANEL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what promises to be the first major test of the Clinton Administration's 
much-touted "industrial policy," the Pentagon announced Friday that it will 
cover half the cost of a $100-million project to manufacture flat-panel display 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T Corp. and Xerox Corp., two of America's leading multinationals, and 
Standish Industries, a small Lake Mills, Wis.-based manufacturer of the 
displays, will get the money to manufacture high-resolution color screens 
developed at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center.

 The pilot plant will supply the Pentagon with displays for such military needs 
as electronic battlefield maps. But the Pentagon's primary objective is to 
assure America a share of a $5-billion industry that is now 95%-controlled by 
Japanese behemoths such as Sharp and NEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Flat-panel displays, which are lightweight and use little energy, are being 
incorporated into the design of everything from laptop computers and personal 
digital assistants to airplane cockpits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project should substantially reduce the major technical and 
manufacturing uncertainties which have been obstacles to the establishment of 
display manufacturing capabilities which meet national security needs," Ken 
Flamm, principal deputy assistant secretary of defense, said in a statement. 
Flamm announced in April the Clinton Administration's intention to pump $580 
million into the display business over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Xerox rejected complaints that the project involves subsidies to large 
companies that are perfectly capable of financing the technology themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the U.S. to get into very high-volume manufacturing, it takes very large 
companies with very large resources," said Malcolm Thompson, chief technologist 
at the Palo Alto Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the Pentagon money will help the three companies move much more 
quickly toward developing the advanced machinery required to build 
sophisticated displays, which sometimes contain as many as 6 million 
transistors on a single screen. The company hopes to be ready to invest in a 
larger plant capable of volume manufacturing in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a display that has a better image quality than a printed page," Thompson 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You won't have to print everything up; you will be comfortable reading off 
the screen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standish and Xerox have been working together to develop the screen for 
several years, and they will focus on the manufacturing process needed to build 
them. AT&T will contribute chip packaging technology and assemble the final 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Xerox will not use its polysilicon technology, a radically different approach 
to building screens that some observers believe has the best potential for 
cutting manufacturing costs. Instead, it will use conventional "amorphous" 
technology already highly developed by Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
 David Mentley, a flat-panel expert at San Jose-based Stamford Resources Inc., 
said he is skeptical that the project will do much to slow Japan's flat-panel 
juggernaut.

 AMD's Earnings Up Sharply: Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Advanced Micro Devices, 
boosted by surging sales, reported a 45% rise in second-quarter profit.The 
microprocessor manufacturer earned $93.2 million, or 93 cents per share, in the 
quarter ended June 26. A year ago, it earned $64.4 million, or 65 cents per 
share, in the same period. Revenue was $533.3 million, up 30% from $409.1 
million in the year-ago period. "AMD had another excellent quarter as our 
non-microprocessor business grew and microprocessor sales remained at record 
levels," Richard Previte, president and chief operating officer, said in a 
statement. AMD's stock closed up $1 at $26 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Intel to Cut Chip Prices Faster: Faced with intensifying competition, the 
Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker will break with its usual practice and cut 
prices on its 486 and Pentium chips twice in the fiscal third quarter, a 
company official said. Intel traditionally shaves prices just once each 
quarter, on the first day of the period.Its 486 and Pentium chips are the 
brains inside an estimated 75% of the world's personal computers. This time, 
Intel will announce initial cuts Tuesday -- the first day of its new quarter -- 
and will make a second round of cuts Aug. 1. The plan for a double cut comes as 
Intel aggressively tries to present Pentium as the standard chip for PCs, 
eating into the market of companies that make clones of Intel's 
previous-generation 486 chips. The company is also trying to ward off 
competitive threats to Pentium from PowerPC, a chip developed jointly by 
Motorola Inc., International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.

THEATER REVIEW; GAL-VANIZED CRAZIES, FOOLISH CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Shakespeare's "Othello," the women -- well, Desdemona -- don't make out 
very well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County Crazies' new Saturday night show, "Orangethello," the 
women seem to be exacting some revenge. If this group -- which is, after all, 
led by a woman (Cherie Kerr) -- has been struggling for its own brand of gender 
equity, then the struggle is more or less over. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, while one of the best trends here is how gal Crazies are getting 
equal time and laughs with the guys, the worst is how the running-theme gimmick 
(this time a po-mo (postmodern), O.C.-style version of "Othello") is so unfunny 
and unwatchable. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, kill off the "Orangethello" bit, and you cut possibly 20 minutes off 
what already is a long show at 2 hours and 40 minutes. (And it would still need 
trimming.) 
</P>
<P>
 So strong are many of the written skits that the running-theme bit is a 
nuisance. And pointless: Any connection this bit would like to make between 
Othello's murder of Desdemona and the O.J. Simpson case is quite lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Another skit, written by Eric Halasz and Kerr, is a much cleverer take on the 
case, as Meri Jansons' Nicole Brown Simpson is being pestered by MCI as O.J. 
Simpson is breaking down the door. Later, Jansons plays anchor Terribly Murky 
in an amusing media-frenzy spoof of "Hard Copy." 
</P>
<P>
 The main staple of this group is ribbing affluent Orange Countians. In a skit 
devised by Patsy Fung, Janette Jensen, Toni Ala and Kerr, a harried commuter 
(Jensen) does her makeup and stuffs breakfast down her throat while combatting 
the freeways. It's the simplest idea with a perfect payoff, made vividly large 
by Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
 While the potentially explosive Fung is woefully underused (her only real bit 
being a patronized Japanese exchange student), Patty DeBaun and Ala are Crazies 
who live up to the name -- especially in a skit about a woman trying to resist 
a doughnut, and another about a Nazi-like condo-owners' association. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't totally forget the guys: The only veteran left from the old Crazies days 
is Halasz, but it's Phil Fleischmann who commandeers some of the night's best 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischmann, who looks like Stan Laurel on drugs, appears first as an insanely 
robotic stand-up comic named Phil; later (and most memorably) as the world's 
most hapless supermarket checkout clerk; then as a chap named Fred who must 
improvise a rapid-fire speech on an audience-provided topic (Saturday's topic 
was, ahem, keys). 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischmann even tries to single-handedly save the "Orangethello" mess when 
it's beyond saving. 
</P>
<P>
 While those audience suggestions Saturday were often nicely injected into 
upcoming skits (a Crazies specialty), far too much time was spent by Kerr and 
guest host Steve Ostrin getting them from the crowd. Considering the show's 
length, it's a good thing there isn't the usual second music-video spoof -- 
although the one that is here, "When a Man Loves a Beamer" (set to "When a Man 
Loves a Woman") hilariously skewers men's love of luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Gals, you may be in the driver's seat.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; HEY, ISAAK: IS THIS 'GREASE' OR ROCK?; THROUGHOUT THE COACH 
HOUSE SHOW, THE SINGER AND HIS MOSTLY COMPETENT BAND DELIVER ONE UNFORTUNATE 
'50S CLICHE AFTER ANOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The unmistakable aroma of cheese was apparent from the moment that modern-day 
rockabilly Chris Isaak took the spotlight to the tune of Duane Eddy's "Rebel 
Rouser" on Thursday at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedecked in a sense-assaulting suit of tawdry flower print that would have 
looked more at home on an aging Long Island housewife, Isaak gave early, 
advance notice of his performing muse. The man earns his living by exploiting 
his quite pretty face and even prettier voice in a chintzy, '50s-retro mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-studied camp was the order of the evening, as Isaak and his 
sharkskin-uniformed, hair-spray-stiff band pulled out all the stops at evoking 
early rock 'n' roll frenzy. Throughout the night, one unfortunate performance 
cliche after another was flaunted before the audience ad nauseam. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitars were thrust forth like phallic spears by Isaak, guitarist Greg 
Arrequin and bassist Rollie Salley. Spine-defying backbends were employed by 
saxophonist Johnny Reno, whose very name elicits '50s B-movie imagery. Drummer 
Kenny Dale Johnson pounded his snare with such exaggeration that one couldn't 
help but wonder whether he was attempting to burst through its head -- which is 
exactly what happened eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest axiom in the book is that if you make it look really hard to do, 
you must be rockin' -- and Isaak and company proved more than up to the task of 
grunting and grimacing with the best of 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sound they created, however, was at odds with the histrionics, and Isaak's 
group was for the most part competent and tasteful. But it was little more than 
those adjectives would imply, so it was hard to understand the thinking behind 
the unfortunate theatrics, which usually are reserved for teeny-bopper-marketed 
bands or self-indulgent soloists of whatever stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 The rhythm section was tight and quite effective. Arrequin proved a subtle and 
stylish guitarist, at home with a chooglin' swamp boogie, but really excelling 
on a plaintive ballad. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno, the most vulgar showman of the lot, played nothing but squawking, Sax 
101 solos of two and three notes, despite his aggressive and quite annoying 
flailing. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Isaak is possessed of pipes that soar with rare beauty, moving 
with ease and grace from an ocean-deep baritone to a clean and remarkably 
sustained falsetto. 
</P>
<P>
 But Isaak would be well-served by leaving his Roy Orbison-meets-Elvis fixation 
behind, as no one else will ever cop those good ol' boys' styles to better 
effect than the originators. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the evening, Isaak announced that he would perform a host of new 
songs "because I love you," he said. The sold-out crowd didn't seem to care 
whether what he played was new, old or in between, as it roared and cheered 
every number Isaak pulled out of his hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly well-received was a gorgeous adagio version of his breakthrough 
hit "Wicked Game," in which Arrequin's shimmering guitar tone and Isaak's 
mournful vocal delivered chills down the spine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bo Diddley-esque "I Love You, I Need You, I Quit," in which Isaak indulged 
in orgiastic, Elvis-borne moaning, was met with squeals of such glee from his 
female fans that might one might have believed Presley himself had just entered 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no denying the man's large and loyal legion of supporters, even though 
Isaak is a derivative, if gifted, singer, his band (mostly) tasteful if 
run-of-the-mill, and his show crassly inappropriate.

A SCOFFLAW, NOT A GADFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cathy Curtis' column "Fuzzy Was He" (June 14) misinterpreted my objections to 
Robbie Conal's recent round of postering. 
</P>
<P>
 My complaint was not "primarily directed at Conal's past record as a political 
gadfly." 
</P>
<P>
 Conal is not a gadfly. He is a continued lawbreaker, the point of my 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Conal's modus operandi of plastering posters on private and government 
property without the owner's consent is illegal. The city of Los Angeles billed 
Conal $1,300 in 1988 to remove a set of posters. It can only be assumed he has 
escaped further fines because of the stealthy nature of his illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when the ever-increasing amount of graffiti is adding to the 
ugliness of the region and is depressing and distressing longtime residents, we 
don't needmore individuals contributing to the visual pollution problem, as 
Conal has. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many alternatives open to Conal to legally display his posters, such 
as buying billboard or bus space. Another option is to contract with owners of 
construction sites, as film studios and record companies do. If money is a 
problem, he can seek permission from stores to put his posters in their 
windows.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; WOMEN, MINORITIES ARE FILLING UNITED METHODIST PASTORAL 
POSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congregations with largely white memberships in Toluca Lake and Tarzana will 
welcome Filipino American women as pastors this month in a striking example of 
how women and ethnic minorities are increasingly filling United Methodist 
Church posts in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a Korean American associate minister will augment the staff at 
Northridge United Methodist Church. Two more white clergywomen will join 
pastoral ranks in the Valley, one replacing a male minister in North Hills and 
another going on the staff at Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have felt it is timely and crucial to bring in more women clergy and 
racial-ethnic minorities, especially in the San Fernando Valley," said the Rev. 
Brandon Cho, the Chatsworth-based district superintendent. Cho oversees 62 
churches, nearly half of them in the Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointments, which were effective Friday, reflect the recommendations of 
Cho, a Korean American, and the final decisions of Bishop Roy I. Sano, a 
Japanese American who leads the denomination's California-Pacific Conference, 
or region, from the Pasadena headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the United Methodist "itinerant" system of rotating ministerial 
assignments, a fair number of pastoral changes are announced each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty of nearly 120 recent ministerial changes in the conference were 
"cross-cultural" appointments -- those in which the pastor's racial or ethnic 
heritage differs from that of the assigned congregation, Sano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can proceed in this direction because of the graciousness and openness of 
congregations to accept pastors from a different cultural background," said 
Sano, who succeeded Bishop Jack Tuell two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8.7-million-member United Methodist Church, the nation's second-largest 
Protestant denomination, has worked for decades toward church-wide racial and 
ethnic diversification and opportunities for female ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is accelerating in Sano's region, which covers Southern California 
and Hawaii: 
</P>
<P>
 Only one white male is among 22 candidates for full ministerial status. Of 
seven elders -- the next step to full minister -- three were white women, two 
were Asian men and two were African American women. Among 15 deacons, "only one 
is an Anglo man, four are Anglo women and the rest are Asian or Pacific in 
background," Sano said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No current statistical breakdown was available for racial and ethnic ratios 
among United Methodist ministers in Southern California and Hawaii, but "we are 
catching up in our clergy ranks to reflect the changing demographics," said the 
bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Methodist Church has few Latino congregations in the area, but 
Mexican-born David Tinoco last month was the first Latino to be named 
superintendent for the Riverside District. Tinoco replaced the Rev. Willie 
Foreman, an African American minister who was named pastor of the mostly white 
St. Mark's Church in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasingly multicultural Wilshire United Methodist Church, which has 
always had a white pastor until this summer, began July with the Rev. Osmond 
Lindo, a minister with a black and Latino heritage, heading the 
English-speaking congregation. The Korean, Filipino and Latino congregations 
worshiping there have pastors of the same heritage while the Rev. Chang Soon 
Lee serves as Wilshire's senior pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 At Toluca Lake United Methodist Church, the Rev. Lisa Reyes said she was 
excited about leading her first service Sunday at the 150-member congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter and granddaughter of ministers, Chicago-born Reyes was graduated 
from seminary in the Philippines, but returned to the United States because her 
family was here, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes was coordinating the Filipino ministry in the United Methodists' Long 
Beach District when she was appointed to the Toluca Lake church, which has no 
Filipino members. 
</P>
<P>
 Most female clergy of Asian background have found that they are accepted as 
pastors only in non-Asian United Methodist congregations because older Asian 
church members, male and female, often oppose the idea of female pastors, Reyes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earlier, I was supposed to go to a church which had some Filipino members," 
Reyes said. But she said her appointment was stymied by the objections of an 
older Filipino woman on the church's pastor-parish relations committee, which 
interviewed pulpit candidates. "She said she didn't want a female minister," 
Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that Korean American female clergy face the same cultural obstacle to 
being appointed to congregations of their same ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho agreed that Asian American female ministers have difficulty "dealing with 
the traditional male mind-set of Asian culture that is in fact oppressive to 
female pastors, and to younger pastors in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a cultural gap here that needs to be addressed," Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Soomee Kim Hwang, 38, named as an associate pastor at Northridge, 
said that her previous church, the Pomona Valley Korean United Methodist 
Church, "really tried to open up to the idea of a woman minister -- I have to 
give them credit for that." 
</P>
<P>
 But she asked to serve in a non-Korean congregation because she trained for 
the ministry in California and is unfamiliar with the style of worship and 
church activities most immigrant Korean Christians bring with them to this 
country, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to practice what I learned from seminary, the 'American way,' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem in ethnic ministries worrying church administrators is 
providing English-language services to attract the younger, U.S.-raised 
generations. To that end, Cho named the Rev. John F. Parker, a 
second-generation Korean American, as associate pastor to help the Rev. Kuh 
Chung Kim, pastor of the Korean congregation housed at Woodland Hills United 
Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Tarzana at St. Paul's United Methodist, a congregation of about 
120 members, the Rev. Afrie Songco Joye, a Filipino American clergywoman, will 
start her pastorate on July 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously an associate pastor at Hollywood United Methodist Church, Joye 
holds a doctoral degree from the Methodist-run School of Theology at Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a year ago the mostly white St. Paul's congregation welcomed its first 
black pastor, the Rev. Paul Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho said that appointment didn't work out, partly because Hill felt that his 
calling was to minister in an African American congregation. As of Friday, Hill 
became an associate minister under the Rev. James Lawson, the senior pastor and 
civil-rights veteran at Holman United Methodist Church in the West Adams 
District of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two female clergy new to the Valley are the Rev. Mary Katherine Moran, who 
becomes pastor of Sepulveda United Methodist Church, which has an active social 
service ministry, and the Rev. Cathleen Donavon, named an associate minister at 
the Westlake Village church.

3 ACCUSED OF FRAUD IN CREDIT CARD SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury has indicted a Canyon Country couple and their 
28-year-old son, accusing them of fraudulently obtaining at least $250,000 in 
cash and goods with credit cards issued in the names of more than 50 members of 
a Porter Ranch country club. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those indicted was Elissa Adlard, 59, a secretary at the Porter Valley 
Country Club who allegedly used confidential financial information about 
members to obtain the credit cards used in the fraud scheme.

 Adlard, her husband, James, 62, and the couple's son, Thomas, a business 
office manager in Fresno, were arrested Thursday by Secret Service agents after 
indictments were issued by a federal grand jury in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a middle-aged motherly type," club General Manager Ray Hazzard said 
of Elissa Adlard. "It was a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The club has about 1,000 members and is owned by Dallas-based Club Corp. of 
America, which owns 250 private membership clubs including the Braemar Country 
Club in Tarzana and the City Club in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, the Adlards also fraudulently obtained loans to buy 
two houses -- one in Canyon Country, the other in Fresno -- using proceeds from 
the credit card scheme as cash down payments and lying about Thomas Adlard's 
employment history on loan documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard said club members, who pay a $12,500 one-time entry fee and annual 
dues of $3,300 to belong to the 25-year-old club, are only now learning of the 
fraud scheme which may, at least temporarily, complicate their credit ratings 
if their names were used in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very frustrating not to be able to tell them," Hazzard said. "But we 
were told not to by the agents." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard said he had been told at least eight months ago about the federal 
probe's focus on Elissa Adlard. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. William Hahesy of Fresno said law enforcement officials 
will be preparing a notice that will be sent to the club's members urging them 
to do credit checks on themselves to see if their names had been used in the 
fraud scheme. By doing so, members can start straightening out their credit 
ratings and help authorities further pin down the extent of the scheme, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the money lost, that's the credit card companies' problem. "They're the 
one's left holding the bag," Hahesy said. According to Hahesy, Elissa Adlard 
got Social Security numbers and bank account information about members from 
club records and then used that material to obtain a slew of credit cards, 
including ones issued by Discovery, Wells Fargo Bank, the Broadway, Texaco and 
First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Adlards, federal authorities alleged, had the cards and subsequent 
statements mailed to mail drops or vacant houses which they had access to 
during the two years they ran the scheme. The family used the cards to obtain 
cash, either through ATM machines or through the convenience or courtesy checks 
issued by some credit card companies, and deposit it in accounts they set up 
under aliases. The family would make minimal monthly installment payments to 
keep their credit card accounts open. 
</P>
<P>
 After operating the scheme for a while, the family purchased two homes using 
the cash proceeds to obtain loans from Home Savings of America and from North 
American Mortgage Co., federal authorities alleged. To buy the Fresno house, 
for example, Thomas Adlard allegedly used $23,574 obtained from the credit card 
scam and borrowed another $99,150 from North American.

BEATING THE HEAT; RESIDENTS FLEE TOWN, SEEKING COOLER CLIMES FOR HOLIDAY 
WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Spurred by oven-like heat that deadened everything in its path this past week, 
Los Angeles residents got out of town with a vengeance Friday in search of 
cooler climes for the long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know where I'm going and I don't much care, just so it's not 
hot," said Margaret Simeon, 26, who was shopping for a bathing suit at an 
Encino sporting goods store. "You know those commercials, 'You deserve a 
break?' That's me." 
</P>
<P>
 As early as Friday morning, cars and minivans stuffed with camping gear and 
people wearing shorts and sandals shared freeways with tie-clad commuters who 
hadn't been able to sneak away early. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading south on the Golden State Freeway near Castaic, Ken Kaylor's family 
vacation plan was bulging from the back of his white pickup truck: Piled 
precariously were sleeping bags, lawn chairs, card tables and two aqua-colored 
'Big Wheels' bikes with lavender tires. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kind of looks like the Beverly Hillbillies, huh?" said Kaylor, a resident of 
Lake Hughes, in the hot high desert. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past week, the contractor has been working outdoors in the Antelope 
Valley, each day getting singed by an unrelenting sun. Friday, he took the day 
off to drive his family to a Ventura beach campground, where all were hoping 
for cloudy skies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had reservations for the July 4th weekend about three months ago, and it 
worked out about perfect," said Kaylor. "It's going to be overcast and cool. 
Eighty-degree weather is going to be a lot cooler than 115." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters say the weekend weather back home in Los Angeles -- even in the 
inland San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys -- should be cooler, 
though not necessarily cool.  
</P>
<P>
 "The marine layer has finally kicked in, so it won't be as warm," said Curtis 
Brack, a meteorologist for WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
"But the valley areas will still be pretty warm." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures will hover around the mid-90s in the valleys and the 80s in 
downtown Los Angeles. Hot, yes, said Brack, but a lot better than earlier this 
week when much of Southern California boiled through seven consecutive days of 
100-degree-plus weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're getting back toward more normal temperatures for this time of 
year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacationers and day trippers seeking cooler spots, as usual, will be best off 
heading high in the mountains or out along the coast, where highs will hit only 
the 60s and 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 While Caltrans expects the usual heavy traffic on local freeways and roads to 
the beach this weekend, the only major problem they predict will be on the 
southbound Golden State Freeway between Wheeler Ridge and Ft. Tejon, where two 
lanes will be closed for shoulder repairs. That project could particularly 
affect the return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closed lanes will probably impact people heading back into L. A.," said 
Caltrans spokesman Russ Snyder. "So we are advising people to return a little 
earlier than usual to avoid the rush." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst times for traveling, Snyder said, will be Sunday and Monday evenings 
between 4 and 8 p.m. He said traffic also could back up at the interchange 
between the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways where crews continue to 
repair earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, many were trying for an early jump on the exit traffic -- some more 
successfully than others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was all packed up and ready to hit the road for a little fishing, when I 
forgot something pretty important," said Gary Vincent, a 40-year-old from 
Culver City who had stopped to buy supplies on his way out of town. "Yeah, I 
forgot my fishing gear." 
</P>
<P>
 He was not the only one lacking the necessary equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the busiest rental time of year for us," said Rob Henderson, store 
manager at REI, a Northridge camping gear store. "People are making a run for 
the insect repellent, picking up last-minute stuff and getting out of Dodge." 
</P>
<P>
 A U. S. Forest Service official, however, warned prospective campers that if 
they hadn't already gotten to their favorite campground site or reserved a spot 
by this morning, they probably would not get one this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "On holiday weekends, we just don't have enough sites to meet the demand," 
said Bob Libershal, a fire prevention officer with the U. S. Forest Service at 
the Monte Christo campgrounds in Angeles National Forest. "And this year, 
demand is going to exceed supply again." 
</P>
<P>
 Campers who are not lucky enough to get a spot can camp anywhere in the 
forest, Libershal said, but are prohibited from building fires at areas outside 
established campgrounds.

STATE AGENCY OPPOSES BILL TO OUTLAW PRICE GOUGING; POLITICS: KATZ'S LEGISLATION 
WAS INSPIRED BY ABUSES AFTER JAN. 17 QUAKE. WILSON ADMINISTRATION POINTS TO 
RIGHTS OF SMALL BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raising the ire of consumer advocates, the Wilson Administration has announced 
its opposition to a bill that would outlaw the type of widespread price gouging 
that occurred after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, already passed by the Assembly, would limit price increases on 
essential goods and services to 10% in the wake of a natural disaster such as 
an earthquake or wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state Department of Consumer Affairs says it wants the legislation 
diluted so businesses can raise prices by 50% immediately following such 
calamities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the department wants the bill's author, Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), to reduce proposed fines for price gouging from $10,000 to $1,000. 
It also wants Katz to remove language calling for immediate revocation of a 
contractor's license if he or she is convicted of price gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is not that we support price gouging, because we certainly don't," 
said Traci Stevens, the department's deputy director for legislation. "But it's 
also a small business issue. Placing caps on prices is a sensitive thing. It 
doesn't do anyone any good if small businesses are forced to shut down because 
they can't raise prices to pay for reconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said Gov. Pete Wilson's office supports the department's position on 
the bill. "In order for us to have an approved position, it has to go through 
the governor's office," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's stance on the bill, which sailed through the Assembly in 
June and is scheduled for a Senate hearing Tuesday, provoked charges that 
business interests were getting more protection than consumer concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's just outrageous," said Gail Hillebrand of the Consumers Union, 
publisher of Consumer Reports. "The Wilson Administration's consumer protection 
agency has declared that businesses in state-of-emergency areas should be 
allowed to gouge consumers by up to 50%." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong legislation is needed, Hillebrand said, because "California needs to 
send a message to businesses that you can't take advantage of consumers at the 
very vulnerable time after a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz introduced the bill amid a flood of complaints after the Jan. 17 quake 
that some merchants were charging inflated prices for services and such 
essential goods as gasoline, batteries, water and building supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 A liter of water went for $12.15, a foot of pipe for $850 and a $1.59 pack of 
batteries sold for $10. Contractors reportedly were overcharging for everything 
from utility hookups to plywood. The Los Angeles County Department of Consumer 
Affairs recorded about 1,460 complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 While Katz says he may compromise on the issue of automatic revocation of 
contractors' licenses -- allowing the Contractors State Licensing Board to 
determine discipline on a case-by-case basis -- he will not back down on the 
10% limit on price hikes or the proposed $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe that a department called Consumer Affairs would come out 
and say, 'You ought to be able to raise prices,' " Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen some bizarre positions by state agencies before, but from an 
election year standpoint, this is not only bad policy, it's bad politics," he 
said. "The governor's office has come out with a position now that you ought to 
be able to take advantage of people in the middle of a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, however, denied that the department favored businesses over 
consumers. "We are trying to achieve a balance here that's appropriate for 
adequate consumer protection and maintaining small business, too," she said.

GRAND JURY BLASTS FISCAL CONDITION OF COLLEGES; FINANCE: PANEL CALLS THE 
DISTRICT AMONG THE WORST IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. REPORT CITES DEFICIT 
SPENDING AND FAILURE TO KEEP A PRUDENT RESERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a strongly worded report Friday, the Ventura County grand jury blasted the 
county's community college district, accusing it of being among the state's 
worst in terms of fiscal management. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Trustees needs to provide evidence to the taxpayers of Ventura 
County that they are taking immediate steps to improve the fiscal management" 
of the district, the grand jury said in a special supplemental report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the district has failed to maintain a prudent reserve to guard 
against the impact of expected state budget cuts, "as is being done in 59 of 
the 71 community college districts." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they have not read the grand jury's report and 
declined to be interviewed. But they did issue a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the grand jury has identified are issues that we essentially presented 
to them," Chancellor Thomas G. Lake said in the release. "All issues are being 
addressed and many are part of the goals and objectives for this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report comes just two weeks after an audit revealed the Oxnard 
College bookstore has lost tens of thousands of dollars during the current 
academic year due to poor accounting practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The special report on problems at the community college district was released 
by the 1993-94 grand jury Friday along with its annual report on county 
government. The grand jury -- made up of citizens nominated by Superior Court 
judges and selected by lot -- is a centuries-old institution that performs 
three main functions: indictment of criminal suspects, charging of public 
officials with misconduct and oversight of local government operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees of the county community college district have adopted a tentative 
budget for the coming fiscal year that includes a $3-million shortfall in 
revenues, which would be made up with the district's cash reserves until more 
state funds become available. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit has sparked talk of layoffs of part-time teachers and cuts in 
class schedules at Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura colleges -- the campuses 
comprising the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has 63,796 students, including 20,667 who are full time, the 
grand jury report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury said the college district is one of only 12 on a state "watch 
list" because of fiscal-management problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The watch list is for districts with potential fiscal problems that should be 
addressed within 18 to 36 months to avoid becoming more serious, the grand jury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The college district "has not maintained sound fiscal management, as evidence 
by the rating from the State Chancellor's Office," the report said. "The 
district is not maintaining prudent reserves and is practicing deficit 
spending." 
</P>
<P>
 There were also numerous recommendations in the grand jury's annual report, 
including one calling for financial and performance audits of each county 
agency and department. 
</P>
<P>
 Such audits would help make the entities more accountable to the Board of 
Supervisors, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without regular performance audits, the Board of Supervisors cannot be 
assured it would have adequate and complete information needed to adequately 
evaluate a department's budget, performance, or compliance with policies and 
procedures," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, the grand jury recommended a landfill site in the west county, 
but did not specify Weldon Canyon, as a previous panel had done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every proposal has its pros and cons and more importantly, it's political 
ramifications; east county vs. west county or not-in-my-back yard," the grand 
jury wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of supervisors have consistently opposed a landfill at the site 
between Ojai and Ventura, but a San Diego County firm is now seeking voter 
approval for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bailard Landfill, which now handles much of the west county trash, is set 
to close in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury also audited the county's Drinking Driving Program and found 
some disturbing information: Staff members only spent 42% of their time with 
the program's participants. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury recommended additional training and staff development, as well 
as the creation of a policy and procedures manual. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, the report recommended Ventura County: 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide additional equipment for the county's Emergency Operations Center, 
including antennas and cable drops needed to keep cellular phones, computers 
and two-way radio communication open in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pursue plans to use the Point Mugu Airport facility for commercial flights. 
The U.S. Navy has proposed sharing use of the runways there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create one-stop permit centers, where various county agencies can issue the 
paperwork needed for construction. The panel recommended keeping open the East 
County Building and Safety office, which could be threatened by budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider consolidating maintenance facilities for the Fire District and 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use more computers to cut down the paperwork load for social workers. 
Employees in the Public Social Services Agency reported spending 80% of their 
time on paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 * Install computer check-out and climate control systems in Ventura's Foster 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find a landfill site in the western half of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendations for cities and special district include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District should turn its equestrian center 
over to private interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Oxnard Harbor District should pursue acquisition of a 35-acre site to 
expand the port's activities. The site is now used for the Naval Civil 
Engineering Laboratory, which is scheduled for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Fellows, who served as foreman of the 1993-94 grand jury, said the panel 
spent about 75% of its time overseeing government and the other 25% hearing 
testimony for criminal indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous grand juries have recommended turning over their criminal-indictment 
duties to a separate, part-time grand jury. But Fellows said the 1993-94 panel 
enjoyed those duties and would oppose the suggestion of adding a second grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We enjoyed it. We felt it was educational, and we felt it balanced out work," 
Fellows said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under law, agencies such as the college district targeted by the grand jury 
must respond to its suggestions but need not implement them.

TROLLEY CARRIES HOPES OF VENTURA'S BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in three years, an old-fashioned trolley car rolled through 
the streets of Ventura Friday, carrying with it the hopes of a watchful city 
business community predicting a boon in commerce and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is going to be great for tourism in Ventura," said Monty Clark, 
Ventura Chamber of Commerce president-elect, before hopping aboard for an 
inaugural ride early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't know Ventura, they really don't know what Ventura has to offer," 
Clark said. "We need to show Ventura off. We need to bring people off the 
freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford agreed. "We wanted to give people something to do when they 
come here, and some sign that we want them here and we want them to come back 
-- and this does all of that."  
</P>
<P>
 But business leaders and city officials who took the inaugural ride were not 
the only ones hailing the new service. Once the trolley opened to the public at 
10 a.m. and found a few passengers, the good words continued to flow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm in Disneyland," said an enthusiastic Lydia Allaniz, a 
31-year-old Ventura resident riding "just for fun." 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, the going was slow as the forest-green trolley started its 
first run. The bell-ringing vehicle -- which resembles a San Francisco cable 
car, except it's gas-powered and travels on wheels -- made no pickups until 
about halfway through its route. At City Hall the first three passengers -- 
including Allaniz -- stepped onto the trolley. 
</P>
<P>
 Climbing the entrance steps with a blue balloon in hand was 6-year-old Jimmy 
Biselli of Lancaster, the very first rider to board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like riding rides. . . . I like the seats," he said later, referring to the 
authentic-looking, polished wooden bench seats. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Esther Biselli 35, said she was raised in Ventura and already knew 
and loved the city. She said she saw the trolley as an ideal way to show her 
son the city while exposing him to its history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great way to show him all the exciting things that Ventura has in a 
fun way," she said over the sound of the trolley conductor talking through a 
microphone about historical, business and entertainment points of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The trolley seats 22 and runs from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week. It 
continually shuffles passengers between the harbor, the pier and downtown, 
making 10 planned stops in all, though it can be hailed from the street. 
Organizers said they are hoping to "unify" the city by shuttling passengers 
between the city's most popular tourist and downtown business areas, which 
unfortunately are miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura has a lot of diverse amenities," said Debbie Solomon, public affairs 
coordinator for Ventura, who helped organize the trolley service to better 
accommodate the city's 2 million annual visitors. "There's a real need to 
enhance our visitor circulation because of the way those areas are spread out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trolley is privately owned by contractor Diana Madison and Associates, who 
operated the trolley in Ojai until earlier this year when Ojai replaced the 
vehicle with a new propane gas-powered trolley. 
</P>
<P>
 The last trolleys to rumble through the streets of Ventura left town in 1991 
for a new home in Palm Springs. The Buenaventura Trolley Co. ran two colorful 
trolleys from 1988 to 1991 but became plagued with debts. The Ventura City 
Council rejected a proposal to subsidize the trolleys in 1991, and no other 
group came forward to provide help. Although ridership at the time was 
increasing, the trolleys were only 23% full during 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buford said there's "a little bit stronger spirit now" and "the business 
community now feels responsible to work with the city as a team" and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison pays for running the service through advertisements presented on the 
trolley's sides and through the full-day fares. But interested Ventura 
merchants, who have been pushing to bring back a trolley, pitched in with a 
$5,000 subsidy from the Downtown Business Assn. and the Ventura Harbor Village 
Merchant Assn. The subsidy essentially pays for the trolley's insurance, said 
Julie Amendola, marketing director of Ventura Harbor Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The trolley service will run until March 30, 1995. By April 1, Solomon said, 
the city hopes to buy its own trolley with the help of a $76,996 federal grant 
and bid it out to a private operator who would manage the service. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon said she expected few riders on the first day. But she predicted that 
media exposure and about 60,000 visitors flooding Ventura for the July 4 
holiday weekend to bring full loads of passengers onto the trolley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be spectacular over the holiday weekend and on the 
Fourth of July," she said. "I think it's going to be packed." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Marlette, 32, of Canoga Park was sightseeing in Ventura Friday when he 
and his family stumbled upon the trolley. Marlette, his wife Teresa, 28, and 
his three young daughters were the second group to jump on the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd taken a trip on it about four years ago. I guess it stopped running for 
awhile, and this morning when we eating breakfast at Denny's we saw it running 
so we went to the Visitor's Bureau and got the schedule," Marlette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Marlette said the trolley gives her husband a chance to see the sights 
he would normally miss as he drove his family around town. 
</P>

 "I like to come (to Ventura) because it's kind of laid-back quiet, a lot more 
quiet than Los Angeles," she said, peering out the large trolley windows as her 
1-year-old daughter, Laurin, slept soundly in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Marlettes, Kathleen Ninneman, 45, of Ventura stopped the trolley and 
queried the trolley conductor: "Is this going to the harbor?" 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor said yes, and Ninneman was on her way.

FIRM OFFERS TO TAKE TRASH TO ARIZONA AND L.A. COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With a nasty debate looming over a proposed Weldon Canyon landfill, a national 
waste management firm is offering to take Ventura County's trash and dump it in 
Los Angeles County and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., the nation's second-largest waste handler, 
has approached city and county officials with a plan to accept trash at three 
existing landfills -- at a price the firm says would be cheaper than Weldon's 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 BFI will present the plan this month to the Ventura County Waste Commission, 
an advisory group of city and county leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There appears to be a great need for a solution," said Hardy M. Strozier, a 
consultant working with BFI in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Weldon Canyon controversy is a terrible political monkey on the backs of 
some politicians. The Bailard Landfill is about to shut down," Strozier said, 
referring to the planned closure in 1997 of the Bailard Landfill near Oxnard. 
"You put those two facts together and you think they would want to find a 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee said she had not yet been briefed on the proposal, 
but said the concept sounded reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's exactly the thing we're going to see more and more, people 
competing for the waste, and we're getting a better price for it," said Kildee, 
a foe of the Weldon project. With the excess space in the region's landfills, 
she said, Ventura County does not need another site. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents of the Weldon Canyon project argue that opening a new local 
landfill would provide a closer, cheaper site for garbage disposal, especially 
if BFI chose to send the trash to its La Paz landfill on the California-Arizona 
border. Weldon Canyon's rates, or tipping fees, cannot exceed $39 a ton, under 
conditions spelled out in a ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can ship it to La Paz for less than $39 a ton, I'll give them a lot 
of waste," said Richard Chase of Taconic Resources Inc., the prime mover behind 
the ballot initiative to authorize the Weldon landfill. "I think it's clearly 
not possible to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Anderson, BFI's regional landfill manager, acknowledged he could not 
beat that price at La Paz, but doubted that Weldon Canyon could keep its rates 
that low. The relatively small volume proposed for the 551-acre site and the 
time it would take to gain approval for the project would only add to Weldon's 
costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunshine Canyon, near Granada Hills, tipping fees lie in the $20 to $30 
range, Anderson said. Also, BFI could use a landfill farther east at Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, Ventura County could avoid the continuing headache of Weldon 
Canyon. Plans for the controversial landfill appeared dead last year, when 
Waste Management Inc. withdrew its proposal after years of trying to woo 
unfriendly county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chase's Taconic Resources resurrected the proposal with a petition drive 
to put the matter before voters. The petition drive garnered enough signatures 
to qualify for the November ballot. Now the Ojai City Council is preparing to 
file suit to stop the landfill, which would be situated between Ojai and 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 BFI officials say they hope to offer a less political, more palatable option. 
</P>
<P>
 One Weldon foe, nonetheless, remained cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see what BFI has to say," said Nina Shelley, an Ojai City Council 
member who sits on the county Waste Commission. "I have some concern with such 
a huge corporation coming into the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley said she would prefer to see the western Ventura County cities rely 
largely on recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, shipping the waste out of the county could also anger San Fernando 
Valley activists, who have waged a fierce legal battle to block expansion of 
the Sunshine Canyon landfill, situated at Interstate 5 and California 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley activists were surprised Friday to hear about BFI's interest in Ventura 
County, especially since the firm cited Los Angeles County's mounting garbage 
problem to justify a Sunshine Canyon expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "BFI would not dare bring up that subject to our faces," said Terry du Soleil 
of the North Valley Coalition of Concerned Citizens. "The justification for 
Sunshine Canyon is that there is this overwhelming need for landfills." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Woodlock, attorney for the coalition, agreed. "They have marvelous 
charts down in L.A. County that say we should be standing in garbage right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 BFI filled up its first landfill at the site in 1992 and has been waiting for 
court approval to start on a 17-million-ton expansion. Construction began last 
week, only to be stopped by a judge's order Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne will decide July 12 whether to 
make the order permanent or allow the landfill operators to continue cutting 
down trees at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said the landfill has "ample space" for trash from Ventura and Los 
Angeles counties. "The entire market in the Los Angeles area is very 
competitive," he said. "Since our site has been closed down for a couple of 
years, we want to build up (business) again."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: OJAI; TESTS CONTINUING ON CONTAMINATED TUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The manager of the Wheeler Hot Springs resort near Ojai, where a problem with 
contaminated water has forced officials to shut down the hot tubs, said Friday 
that the resort will refinish its tubs, alter its water-introduction system, 
and add a new chlorination system in an effort to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The tubs have been closed all week due to high levels of bacterial 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Marshall said he took new water samples Friday and sent them for testing 
to a state certified laboratory in Santa Paula. The third round of tests on 
water in Wheeler's hot tubs came back Thursday, still showing high levels of 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said he is not sure what type of bacteria is in the water, or what 
the source is. But he said the bacteria is not fecal coliform, because recent 
coliform tests have all come back negative. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials were not available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Environmental Health Division ordered the tubs shut down on 
June 22, after getting the results of tests taken after a bather reported 
becoming ill after using one of the tubs. 
</P>
<P>
 More samples will be taken on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said he would not reopen the resort until he changes the water 
introduction system so that greater quantities of fresh water enter the tubs on 
a continual basis. The wooden tubs will also be refinished and a system will be 
installed to add a continual flow of chlorine -- a bacteria killing agent -- 
into the water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will assure an absence of bacteria on a continual basis," Marshall said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: FILLMORE; GUNDERSON WON'T RUN FOR 2ND TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fillmore City Councilman Donald Gunderson has announced that he will not seek 
reelection due to the long hours the job requires and the increasing amount of 
time he spends away from his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson, 59, who in his duties as a Fillmore council member also has served 
on the Ventura Regional Sanitation District and several city committees, has 
served one four-year term on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to the realization that I wasn't in control of things anymore," 
Gunderson said. "I was being run by meetings and agendas. I'd lost control of 
the ability to control my own time." 
</P>
<P>
 A retired U. S. Navy captain who works as a consulting engineer, Gunderson won 
election to the City Council as a first-time candidate in 1990, five years 
after moving to the city of 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits his wife, Ruthie, for helping him win the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I married Ruthie and I think she got me half the votes," he said. "Most 
people figured any guy that married Ruthie had to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson said he is most proud of helping to get the Fillmore steam train up 
and running during his term. The biggest disappointment, he said, was the 
inability to achieve greater success in marketing north Fillmore industrial 
lots to new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Fillmore Councilman Roger Campbell said the city would miss 
Gunderson's expertise on various subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don was a real asset to the council," Campbell said. "He's one of the more 
intelligent people I've known. The city was better off for the time he served." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson's term expires after the November election. JEFF McDONALD

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; GARAGE DEMOLITION TO BEGIN WEDNESDAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Demolition work on the quake-damaged parking garage at the Glendale Fashion 
Center will begin Wednesday, according to a construction company hired for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The city-owned, three-level garage sustained about $2 million in damage after 
the Northridge earthquake and has since been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some interior columns made of reinforced concrete almost collapsed, said Dick 
Eychner, who is overseeing the demolition work for Evans Brothers Inc. of 
Livermore, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 A section of Wilson Avenue near the parking structure will be closed to 
eastbound traffic for two weeks, starting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take up to 75 days to tear down the garage, which is 324 feet long and 
266 feet wide, Eychner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look as bad as the Glendale Galleria garage or the (Cal State) 
Northridge garage, but with the damage it's not feasible to fix it," he said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; CHILDREN SING FOR ENDANGERED ANIMALS' PLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Aspiring diva Liza Baron wishes she had a dinosaur to pal around with. 
</P>
<P>
 But Liza, 9, soon to be a fifth-grader at Lanai Road School in Encino, wasn't 
prompted to sing about dinosaurs by the bright purple children's idol Barney, 
but rather by animals which today are on the brink of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Liza joined 15 others from across Los Angeles County Thursday in performing 
"The Shambala Revue" at the ARCO Junior Achievement Auditorium in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Produced by a nonprofit organization, See Above Productions Inc., the play is 
a musical commentary on the plight of endangered species told through seven 
songs written by young people ranging in age from 8 to 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors dressed in sweat suits decorated with paint to represent lions, tigers, 
a panther and a snow leopard, sung about Shambala -- an Acton ranch owned by 
actress Tippi Hedren, which provides a refuge for exotic animals who are 
abandoned or mistreated by their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Save me, save me, there's only one, just like me," sang Jeremy Shapiro, a 
10-year-old who wrote the lyrics to a song performed by his character Dorge, an 
endangered snow leopard. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy's commentary on Dorge's dire future, interspersed with slides featuring 
leaping snow leopards, brought tears to the eyes of some in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Troupe veteran Mindy McEnnan -- who plays a rich woman who collects furs 
because she "can afford it" -- said the production is meant to raise people's 
awareness about the fragile world around them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The animals that live on this planet have as much of a right to be here as we 
do," McEnnan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in Los Angeles in 1988, See Above Productions Inc.'s actors perform 
regularly, and recently finished touring with the musical "Writing on the 
Wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Actors took lyrics for this production from letters written by teen-agers in 
jail to other teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group provides an outlet for 30 children a year from various 
socioeconomic backgrounds to express their views about social issues through 
singing, acting and dancing, said spokeswoman Kelly Hayes-Raitt.  
</P>
<P>
 Liza, who has never taken singing lessons in her young life, but can belt out 
a tune better than many who have, said the group has helped her use her talents 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can get a message out. I want to tell people kids can help too -- it's not 
only something that's up to grown-ups," she said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; RESTAURANT MANAGER CITED OVER GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities have cited the manager of a popular Mexican restaurant for leasing 
an arcade game that allegedly violates state gambling law, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The portable machine, which features five games including poker and black 
jack, had been installed in Chuy's Restaurant & Bar, said police spokesman 
Chahe Keuroghelian. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers arrested Chuy's Manager Theodore W. Hatch, 31, on Thursday after they 
came to eat at the restaurant and noticed the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Police determined the machine was illegal when one officer played the 
blackjack option and discovered that it awarded credits for each hand won and 
allowed free play as long as points were accumulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the machine gives credits and does not require any skill, police said, 
Hatch was arrested and cited with a misdemeanor violation of state law for 
operating and maintaining a gambling device.  
</P>
<P>
 Hatch told police he was leasing the game and was unaware it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Keuroghelian distinguished the game from other arcade games such as Pac Man 
because legal games allow the player to improve skills with repeated play. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch is scheduled to appear in Glendale Municipal Court for arraignment on 
Aug. 9. JENNIFER OLDHAM

HARVESTS OF CORN EARMARK HOLIDAY; AGRICULTURE: FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND MEANS 
HIGH DEMAND FOR GOLDEN GRAIN AT ROADSIDE STANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the great Midwestern corn belt, farmers are happy if their crop is 
"knee-high bythe Fourth of July." But in Ventura County, growers want their 
sweet corn piled high in the market and ready to eat by that date. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really want it now," said fifth-generation farmer Phil McGrath, who 
grows corn on his 300-acre farm near Camarillo. "The Fourth of July is the 
initiation of summer corn season, and when we have it ready by then, it sells 
like candy." 
</P>
<P>
 To be ready for harvest in July, farmers plant their corn in March. Some 
stagger the planting of their fields so that they can pick a fresh crop every 
week until November. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers try to meet the high demand during the Fourth of July weekend and then 
end their season with high demand around Thanksgiving, McGrath said. They plant 
hybrid varieties of corn, with names that boast of their bountiful flavor, like 
Super Roadside, Golden Jubilee and How Sweet It Is.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lines at roadside stands for the grain, corn accounts for only 
$2.5 million in gross receipts, a drop in the bucket for the county's 
$800-million produce industry, according to a Ventura County Agricultural 
Commission report.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, McGrath said he makes a healthy income from the 10 acres he plants 
with corn each year. He sells his organic corn direct to customers at his 
roadside stand in Camarillo called the Central Market and at farmers' markets 
in Ventura, Santa Barbara and Hollywood. If he sold his corn wholesale to big 
grocery chains, he probably could not stay in business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, many of his customers are corn connoisseurs who eagerly anticipate 
the start of the season, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Thomson, 50, a teacher who lives with his three sons in Simi Valley, 
said he was waiting when the first crop of fresh white corn was harvested for 
sale at the Tierra Rejada Family Farms roadside stand in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know the season is starting when you can see the yellow tassels on the 
corn," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last couple of weeks, Thomson said, he would drive by the fields next 
to the roadside stand to check on whether the corn was ready. When the market 
finally hoisted its flags with ears of corn on them this week, Thomson came in 
and started stuffing a bag with the fresh crop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so much different from the junk you buy in the store," he said. "It 
was picked today. The sugar content is real high, and it tastes tremendous. 
It's like the stuff you might get out of your back-yard garden." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from where Thomson picks up his corn is the Valley Farms 
stand. It is surrounded by rows of tall, green corn topped with their golden 
tassels. Inside the stand, bins packed with white and yellow corn picked only 
hours earlier wait for hungry customers.  
</P>
<P>
 Next door, field workers pack ears of corn -- also harvested that day -- into 
crates that are sold at a wholesale market in Los Angeles and to street 
vendors. The farm managers planted the crop so that a fresh crop will be 
harvested every five days for the next five months.  
</P>
<P>
 "We plan it very carefully," said George Boskovich Jr., the farm's owner. "We 
have people waiting for it. It's sort of a kickoff to summer. When people go to 
a supermarket they might get something that's really . . . blah. They're ready 
for something they can buy that was picked that same day. It tastes better."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SHERIFF'S MOBILE MINI-STATION INAUGURATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 residents showed up Friday at the inauguration of a Sheriff's 
Department mobile mini-station designed to provide law enforcement service to 
10 unincorporated communities in western Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an effort we are making to provide services which would be difficult 
otherwise," said Sheriff Larry Carpenter during the ribbon-cutting ceremony at 
the corner of Vineyard Avenue and Stroube Street in El Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said the 32-foot-long mini-station will be placed in the areas which 
do not have a sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of going to our office in Ventura, residents will be able to get help 
from a station in their own neighborhood," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 People will be able to report crimes and other problems directly to the mobile 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit will also work as a link between residents and the county's various 
social agencies, Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a community service place," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he added, "If a resident needs medical or counseling assistance, 
the staff in the station can contact the various agencies in the county and 
make appointments for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The mini-station has five emergency dispatching radios, a fax machine, 
cellular phones, laptop computers and a printer. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina Centeno, 20, of El Rio said she believes the presence of the mobile 
unit in the neighborhood will keep gang members at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet a lot of the gang members will not come out as much," Centeno said. 
"This is one of the best things that could happen to our community." 
</P>
<P>
 The children in the neighborhoods will also become more familiar with the 
sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday morning, 115 children from El Rio Recreation Center and El Rio 
School chatted with deputies who handed them stickers, storybooks and pencils.  
</P>
<P>
 "The young will learn to respect the cops," said Lois Wall, a Silver Strand 
Beach resident who attended the opening ceremony. "Their presence will help to 
keep the kids away from drugs and violence."  
</P>
<P>
 The staff in the mini-station will also provide patrols by foot and bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhoods selected for a weekly visit each are: Casitas Springs, 
Meiners Oaks, Hollywood Beach, Saticoy, Montalvo, Rincon, El Rio, Silver Strand 
Beach, Nyeland Acres and Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 A location in each of those areas has been designated, and the station will be 
open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at a site designated in each of those communities. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be staffed by one sheriff's deputy, a technician and two volunteers.

 Ventura County sheriff's deputies were searching for clues Friday in the 
slaying of a woman whose slightly decomposed body was found in the living room 
of her Nyeland Acres home Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Lorenda Valverde, 35, was discovered by her landlord about 10:15 
p.m., said Sheriff's Lt. Craig Husband.She had apparently been strangled to 
death with a cord, said Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord, Raymond Amaro, lives on the property in the 3500 block of Almond 
Drive. Amaro had not seen Valverde for days and decided to enter her apartment, 
finding her body, Husband said.  
</P>
<P>
 Valverde's death was not related to a burglary, Husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies would not say how long she had been dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors on Friday described Valverde as a quiet woman who was sometimes seen 
playing with her kittens outside her home. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

 Police are investigating the stabbing death of a 31-year-old Pacoima man whose 
body was found early Friday at a Pacoima motel, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A manager at Las Palmas Motel who had heard gunshots called police at about 
3:30 a.m., said Detective Frank Bishop of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers responding to the scene discovered the body of Derick Pinks, who had 
been stabbed "more than once" in the upper torso, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses later told police they saw two men speed off in a beige, 
foreign-made pickup truck just after they heard gunshots, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop said no motive has been established. Police are looking for the man who 
rented the motel room where Pinks was found. ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ALGAE BLOOM ALTERS WATER'S TASTE, SMELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A large algae bloom in Castaic Lake brought on by warm temperatures is causing 
an unpleasant but harmless taste and odor in state water, water officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Water District spokesman Bob Gomperz said 450,000 customers of 
Calleguas Municipal Water District, which distributes state water from 
Metropolitan to all of eastern Ventura County, as well as Oxnard and Camarillo, 
may notice the bad taste in their tap water in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a health hazard," Gomperz said. "It's just a nuisance. There is no 
visual change in the water, but people with sensitive nostrils may notice a 
musty taste and smell." 
</P>
<P>
 Gomperz said the best way to combat the bad taste, which is caused by the 
algae geosmin, is to fill a pitcher with tap water and leave it in the 
refrigerator. "Cooling water helps eliminate the smell and taste for some 
reason," Gomperz said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Metropolitan was trying to blend the Castaic water with supplies from 
the Colorado River to combat the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the lake was too large to make treating it with chemicals feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 The filtration process the state water normally goes through cannot eliminate 
the algae, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloom could last as long as several weeks, and is likely to return late in 
the summer if the hot weather continues, he said. "It could get worse," Gomperz 
said. "But frankly, a lot of our customers are used to this. I've been with 
this agency 10 years and this seems to happen every year." MARY F. POLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: VENTURA; COUNCIL POSTPONES DISCUSSION ON SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With only four of seven council members in attendance, the Ventura City 
Council postponed discussion this week of a plan to open a homeless shelter for 
the mentally ill in downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter, which would be located at the Turning Point Foundation's drop-in 
center for the mentally ill, was approved by the Planning Commission, but has 
been appealed to the council by a neighbor of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which does not meet next week because of the Fourth of July 
holiday, will consider the issue July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 William Orcutt, owner of a parcel on Thompson Boulevard across the street from 
the foundation, agreed at Monday's council meeting to postpone the hearing 
because he wanted the entire council to hear his argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Orcutt said the Turning Point Foundation's mentally ill clients should not be 
allowed to stay overnight. The Turning Point is a daytime center where the 
mentally ill drop in for food, health care and companionship. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this fall, however, Turning Point officials want to clear out one of 
the building's two rooms each night to make way for roll-away beds and 
partitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has agreed to certain conditions for their nighttime shelter, 
such as guests would spend no more than 90 nights in a row at the shelter; at 
least two employees would remain on duty at all times; and lighting would be 
added to the back of the building to discourage homeless people from sleeping 
there. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: OXNARD; 4 TEEN-AGERS HELD IN YOUTH'S STABBING

<P>
 A teen-age stabbing victim was hospitalized in critical condition and four 
other teen-agers were under arrest Friday in connection with a gang-related 
fight in Oxnard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the youths, both age 16 and from Oxnard, were arrested late Wednesday, 
shortly after the gang confrontation on Devonshire Drive and Ventura Road that 
led to the stabbing, police said.Their names were not released because of their 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Two additional suspects, a 17-year-old youth and Luis Tapia, 18, both of 
Oxnard, were arrested Thursday after a witness identified them through police 
photographs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Rancy Dillon, 16, of Oxnard was among a gang of 10 to 20 people 
who fled after the rival gangs exchanged signs, Detective Ron Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some unknown reason, they honed in on him," Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, Dillon was stabbed repeatedly by the four teen-agers. 
The four fled after Dillon's friends ran to help him, Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon was in critical condition Friday at St. John's Regional Medical Center 
in Oxnard, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapia was being held at Ventura County Jail on $250,000 bail for attempted 
murder. He was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three teen-agers will be held at Juvenile Hall pending a court 
hearing. PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; BOARD SEEKS WAYS TO CURB DROPOUT RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spurred by an increasing number of dropouts in Simi Valley, school board 
members have called for a new method of tracking students who leave school and 
getting them back in class. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District had the third highest dropout rate in 
Ventura County in 1993, according to a recent state report. State education 
officials define a dropout as any student who has been absent for 45 
consecutive days and has not enrolled at another school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really unhappy about our dropout rate," board member Debbie Sandland 
said. "I think we have a real serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
 According to state figures, the number of Simi Valley 10th- through 12th-grade 
students who left school without a diploma rose from 11% in 1992 to 12.5% in 
1993. Neighboring Conejo Valley Unified School District had one of the lowest 
dropout rates in the county last year at 5.2%, the state report showed. 
</P>
<P>
 While school board members questioned the accuracy of the state's findings at 
their meeting this week, they agreed that Simi Valley has a problem that needs 
to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the issue is not these numbers," board member Diane Collins 
said during the meeting. "(But) we need to bring back a plan to address the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent district study identified several dropout categories, including 
pregnant minors and students who have been expelled. The report also said about 
38 of the 179 students who left school in 1993 dropped out after their 18th 
birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 At their retreat later this month, board members hope to develop a plan for 
reaching students who are at risk of becoming dropouts, Sandland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a districtwide policy to track dropouts," she said. "I really think 
we've been too casual about kids dropping out. We haven't taken this 
seriously." TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; THEATER PANEL DELAYS PLAZA SHOW 
DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Awed by the light and the heat, but afraid of smoke and mirrors, Thousand 
Oaks' theater commissioners have refused to sanction a proposed laser and 
fireworks extravaganza -- until they have more details. 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens committee helping to plan the grand opening bash for the Civic Arts 
Plaza had proposed a razzle-dazzle outdoor gala featuring pyrotechnics, water 
jets, flashing lights and thousands of local performers. 
</P>
<P>
 But while several theater commissioners said they liked the concept, they 
worried about the logistics of staging such a blowout, which would cost at 
least $100,000. Furthermore, they could not envision how to safely pack the 
projected audience of 50,000 people into a quarter-mile stretch of Thousand 
Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to shut the door completely," commissioner Virginia Davis said. 
"But in order to say, 'This sounds wonderful, we want it here,' we need to have 
some questions answered." 
</P>
<P>
 With just four months to go before October's grand opening weekend, 
commissioners decided that the citizens group did not have enough time to pull 
off a successful show. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they asked residents to draft detailed plans for traffic management, 
police and fire protection and crowd control. They also urged the organizers to 
begin lining up private donations, since the city will not pay for the huge 
celebration. STEPHANIE SIMON

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; MAN GETS 18 MONTHS FOR EVADING POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills man was sentenced to 18 months in jail Thursday for leading 
police on a car chase from Canoga Park to Hollywood in May. 
</P>
<P>
 A Van Nuys Municipal Court judge ordered Ion Rada, 31, to immediately begin 
serving his term -- the maximum permissible for the offenses -- after a jury 
found him guilty of evading a police officer and resisting arrest May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4 a.m. that day, Rada kicked in the front door of a Canoga Park 
apartment and attacked his former girlfriend's parents and another family 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 All three suffered cuts and bruises before one of them called police and Rada 
fled, according to Deputy City Atty. Howard Fuchs, who handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
 After investigating, police left the apartment but came back minutes later to 
find that Rada had returned. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove away in a gold Cadillac, leading police on a chase along surface 
streets and on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rada obeyed speed limits and other traffic rules during the first part of the 
chase but tried to ram police squad cars twice near the end of the spree, Fuchs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police finally cornered Rada about 5:50 a.m. in the parking lot of the CBS 
building in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Rada surrendered after a brief struggle, during which police used pepper spray 
to subdue him. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to undergo a blood-alcohol test and remained in jail until 
Thursday's hearing. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; INJURIES TEACH ACTOR SUCCESS AND SURVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As a successful television actor, Robert David Hall knows what it means to 
enter a room and be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he has rarely experienced the emotion he encountered last month 
when he was honored for his work on behalf of burn victims. 
</P>
<P>
 It came from more than 300 burn survivors at a meeting of the World Burn 
Congress in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, a burn victim himself, helped make a documentary about burn injuries, 
treatment and the role of friends and loved ones in the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people had seen me when they were in recovering in the critical burn 
wards," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the medal he received for his role in the film, Hall said, "I felt 
like the cowardly lion in 'The Wizard of Oz.' " 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15 years ago, Hall survived a fiery car accident that resulted in 
third- and fourth-degree burns over 60% of his body and the amputation of both 
his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a film, television and voice-over actor, Hall has overcome the loss of his 
legs. His latest endeavor was playing the villain in "Dream Lover," which 
starred James Spader. 
</P>
<P>
 As a disabled actor, Hall said he faces the unique situation of living with 
the disfigurement caused by burns in an industry where "You can't just be OK 
looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said his experiences have taught him "beauty does come from the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said he believes that his accident served a purpose. He has similar 
feelings about another tragedy that touched him personally.  
</P>
<P>
 He suffered $70,000 to $80,000 in damage to his Northridge home in the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the second scariest event in my life," recalled Hall, who sees 
parallels between the quake and his accident. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes something positive will come from the earthquake's devastation. 
"That's not hippie mumbo-jumbo either," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his success in both his life and career, Hall insisted, "I'm not a 
hero. I survived and managed to do just a little better than just survive."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: QUAKE ASSISTANCE GROUPS WIN GRANTS

<P>
 Two groups that assist residents who were left homeless or suffered damage in 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake were among 19 Southern California recipients 
of $3.9 million in grants from a regional bank in San Francisco, bank officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Habitat for Humanity, an organization founded by former President Jimmy 
Carter, received a $120,000 award to continue its work on projects in the San 
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys as well as in Ventura County, said Nan 
Joesten, manager of the organization's earthquake recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four projects under way in the San Fernando Valley, and about 40 
still pending. Six Valley projects have been completed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Family Housing Corp., which provides emergency, transitional 
and permanent housing, received $79,651 to help finance construction of an 
18-unit two- and three-story apartment building in the 7400 block of Vineland 
Avenue in Sun Valley, said Vera Fleischman, the director of the housing 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of the project is about $2.5 million, Fleischman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Equity Fund has accepted tax credits as equity for the project, 
and the city of Los Angeles Housing Department provided $50,000 per unit, or 
about $900,000 for the construction project, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The units will be available to residents whose annual income falls between 35% 
and 50% of the average national income, as set by the federal Housing and Urban 
Development agency, Fleischman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants were awarded by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, which 
awarded a total of $7.9 million to 34 affordable housing projects in 
California, Florida, Illinois and Nevada. CHIP JOHNSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; MAN, WOMAN KILLED IN HIGHWAY CRASH

 A Moorpark man and a Port Hueneme woman were killed Friday morning when the 
man lost control of the car they were riding in and ran head-on into a tractor 
trailer on California 118, an accident that forced the closure of the busy 
highway for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Alberto Ramirez, 33, was traveling west near Grimes Canyon Road, west of 
Moorpark, when he veered left into the eastbound lane and struck the truck, 
Officer Staci Morse of the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was exceeding the 55 m.p.h. speed limit at the time of the 10:50 a.m. 
accident, but investigators had not yet determined the cause of the crash, 
Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact spun Ramirez's 1979 car and pinned him inside. He died at the scene 
from massive blunt force trauma, Ventura County Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's passenger, Susan Avaya, 35, of Port Hueneme was taken to St. John's 
Pleasant Valley Hospital, where she died a short time later from head injuries, 
Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said autopsies on both victims are expected to be completed today. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the truck, which was carrying berries, was 47-year-old Juan 
Gonzalez Trillo of El Paso, Tex. He was treated for minor injuries at Pleasant 
Valley and released Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Trillo was driving between 35 and 40 m.p.h., Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both lanes of California 118 were closed until 3:30 p.m. because of the 
accident, Morse said. MARY F. POLS

TUJUNGA MAN SENTENCED FOR ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tujunga man arrested three times in the past seven months for abusing his 
girlfriend was sentenced to 10 months in jail Friday, according to the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ararat Mansuryan, 27, was also ordered to stay at least 100 yards away from 
his girlfriend and undergo a year of domestic violence counseling after he 
pleaded no contest to cohabitant abuse and battery, Los Angeles City Atty.James 
Hahn said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old North Hollywood woman first reported the abuse by Mansuryan in 
September when he showed up drunk at her apartment and began screaming and 
shoving her. The abuse escalated to punching and finally to choking, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansuryan, who told police he was a self-employed musician, will begin serving 
his sentence July 21, said Deputy City Atty. Gary Guess, who handled the case.

BFI WANTS TO IMPORT VENTURA WASTE; ENVIRONMENT: COMPANY PROPOSES TRANSPORTING 
GARBAGE TO SUNSHINE CANYON LANDFILL, ANGERING VALLEY ACTIVISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A national waste management firm is offering to take Ventura County's trash 
and dump some of it north of Granada Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., the nation's second-largest waste handler, 
has approached Ventura County officials with a plan to transport trash to three 
existing landfills, including Sunshine Canyon, rather than open a controversial 
551-acre dump site at Weldon Canyon, near the mouth of the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 BFI will present the plan this month to the Ventura County Waste Commission, 
an advisory group of city and county leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the plan angered San Fernando Valley activists, who have waged a 
fierce legal battle to block the expansion of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill, 
which is located near the junction of the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley activists were surprised Friday to hear about BFI's interest in 
Ventura, especially since the firm cited Los Angeles County's mounting garbage 
problem to justify a Sunshine Canyon expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "BFI would not dare bring up that subject to our faces," said Terry du Soleil 
of the North Valley Coalition of Concerned Citizens. "The justification for 
Sunshine Canyon is that there is this overwhelming need for landfills." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Woodlock, attorney for the coalition, agreed. "They have marvelous 
charts down in L.A. County that say we should be standing in garbage right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 BFI filled up its first landfill at the site in 1992 and has been waiting for 
court approval to start on a 17-million-ton expansion. Construction began last 
week, only to be stopped by a judge's order Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne will decide on July 12 whether to 
make the order permanent or to allow the landfill operators to continue cutting 
down trees at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the Weldon Canyon project argue that opening a new landfill 
would provide a closer, cheaper site for garbage disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the controversial landfill appeared dead last year, when Waste 
Management Inc. withdrew its proposal after years of trying to woo county 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chase's Taconic Resources resurrected the proposal with a petition drive 
to put the matter before voters. The drive garnered enough signatures to 
qualify for the November ballot. Now the Ojai City Council is preparing to file 
suit to stop the project, which would lie between Ojai and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 BFI officials say they hope to offer an option more palatable to Ventura 
officials, by shipping the trash to Sunshine Canyon Landfill and other sites 
outside Ventura County.

RUSSO TO FACE NEW TRIAL ON FELONY CHILD ABUSE CHARGE; COURTS: D.A.'S DECISION 
TO REPROSECUTE COMES TWO WEEKS AFTER JURY DEADLOCKED IN THE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney's office will prosecute a wealthy 
Westlake mother a second time on a felony charge of abusing her teen-age 
daughter, a prosecutor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to prosecute Charlotte Russo a second time on a felony charge 
comes two weeks after a jury deadlocked in the high-profile case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona made the announcement after Russo's attorney 
received permission in Superior Court on Friday to delay a hearing in which a 
date for Russo's new trial would have been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Charles W. Campbell declared the earlier mistrial on June 14, after 
jurors reported they were hopelessly deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven jurors cast votes to convict Russo of a felony for biting her daughter. 
But one juror -- who told the others of his own experiences in disciplining an 
unruly child -- voted for an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 That same jury convicted Russo of misdemeanor child abuse for forcing her 
adopted daughter to sleep in a back-yard racquetball court and striking her. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo faces up to six months in jail on her misdemeanor conviction. She would 
face up to six years in prison if convicted of the felony. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Campbell ordered Russo to return to court next Tuesday for the 
setting of her new trial date. 
</P>
<P>
 With 11 jurors voting to convict Russo during the initial trial, prosecutors 
did not have much trouble in reaching the decision to retry the case, Corona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona said the jurors who voted to convict Russo urged prosecutors not to 
drop the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt she was guilty, and they were frustrated about what she did to this 
child," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo's attorney, James M. Farley, said his client requested the continuance 
Friday so she could think about trying to work out a plea agreement with 
prosecutors before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to work something out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo and her husband, Richard, were arrested May 24, 1993, after neighbors 
reported seeing Charlotte Russo attack the girl in the family's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to biting her daughter, now 16, Russo punched, pinched and 
scratched the girl, as well as forced her to sleep for long periods of time in 
the family's back-yard racquetball court, according to trial testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Russo, 50, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse last November 
without going to trial. He served a 30-day jail term and was placed on three 
years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona said Charlotte Russo would not be allowed to plead guilty to a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should not treat children the way (Russo) treated this child," Corona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo's misdemeanor conviction related to all abuse against her daughter 
except the alleged biting, which prosecutors say occurred during the garage 
incident that led to the Russos being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 At Russo's first trial, her daughter testified for nearly five days, including 
an extensive cross-examination by Farley. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona said before Friday that the decision to retry Russo would depend on the 
girl's willingness to take the stand against her mother for a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's willing to go through the ordeal again," Corona said outside court 
Friday.

SIMI EMPLOYEES, MANAGEMENT NEGOTIATORS OK 2-YEAR CONTRACT; LABOR: 
NON-MANAGEMENT WORKERS WILL GET A 2.5% RAISE THIS MONTH, FOLLOWED BY TWO RAISES 
TOTALING 3% IN 1995. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a month of closed-door haggling, city employees and management 
negotiators in Simi Valley have agreed on a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the pact, unanimously approved by the City Council at a special meeting 
Thursday, the city's 264 non-management employees will receive a 2.5% 
across-the-board salary increase beginning July 25. 
</P>
<P>
 They will receive an additional 2% increase in June, 1995, and another 1% 
increase in December, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 185 management employees also will get raises, and some workers 
will get additional pay increases to make up for inequities when contrasted 
with employees in other similarly sized cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Once all of the increases take effect, a tree trimmer who now makes about 
$31,000 annually will make an additional $1,700 a year. A secretary who earns 
$29,000 yearly will take home an additional $1,600 each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a fair agreement," Councilman Bill Davis said. "It certainly is 
not a windfall, but with the economy the way it is, I don't think anybody is 
complaining." 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Bill Shawhan, general manager for the California 
League of City Employee Assns., said he was satisfied with the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the union belief that this contract represents a serious effort on the 
parts of both the city and the union to cooperate in these difficult times," 
said Shawhan, who represented city employees in the negotiations. "We would 
have liked more, but we believe the contract is adequate and meets the needs of 
all the parties for the time being." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell, who handled negotiations for the city, 
said the salary increases kept the wages of Simi Valley employees on par with 
other cities of comparable size. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at a whole range of factors, including compensation in other cities 
like Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Ventura," Sedell said. "Where ours were 
lower, we have increased them accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Sedell found 11 employee categories in which workers were underpaid, including 
account and records clerks, dispatcher trainees and certain types of 
maintenance workers. Those employees will receive an additional 1% to 2.5% 
raise. Management employees will get a 3.36% raise and an increase in annual 
merit pay raises from 3% to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Police captains who now make about $76,000 annually will see their salaries 
increase to $79,000, while a senior planner earning about $59,000 annually will 
be paid an additional $2,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton said he believes the raises are fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure some people will say, 'Goodness gracious, those raises are big,' " 
Stratton said. "But in reality they are not very much, because my observation 
is that public sector employees do a little better in recessions and not as 
well in the good times."

CLEANLINESS NOT ALWAYS NEXT TO GODLINESS; EVANGELICALS: THE BIBLE SAYS CHRIST 
WAS BAPTIZED IN THE FLOWING WATERS OF THE JORDAN RIVER. BUT POLLUTED CREEKS CAN 
POSE A DILEMMA FOR MODERN MINISTERS SEEKING TO UPHOLD TRADITION.

 When it came time for Christine Murphy to be baptized, the eastern Kentucky 
woman went to the creek like her ancestors did. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just feel like you're more closer to God in the creek than you would 
inside" a church, said the 21-year-old Pike County woman, who was dunked last 
month in the waters of Johns Creek. "It's just like being in a bathtub in the 
other place." 
</P>
<P>
 But if cleanliness is truly next to godliness, a lot of pastors say the creek 
is not the place to go anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's none of them fit to baptize a dog in, to be honest with you," said 
the Rev. James Kelly Caudill, pastor of Tom's Creek Free Will Baptist Church at 
Nippa in nearby Johnson County. "It's sad to say, but it's true." 
</P>
<P>
 Evangelical churches have been slowly switching from outdoor baptisms to 
indoor ceremonies during the last few decades, mostly for convenience's sake. 
But open dumping and raw sewage from remote households seem to have speeded up 
the changeover in some areas, pastors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reasoning was if you walk into a river or stream and you've got dead 
animals, you've got open sewers and all other types of debris," said Pastor 
Dick VanHoose of the Salyersville Free Will Baptist Church, who has been 
moderator of the Kentucky State Assn. of Free Will Baptists for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just in my opinion makes it unsafe to take someone for water baptism." 
</P>
<P>
 About 29% of the nation's stream miles were at least partially unfit for 
swimming because of pollution, according to the Environmental Protection 
Agency's National Water Quality Inventory, released in March. The report said 
another 3% would be threatened if no pollution control actions were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bible says Jesus Christ was baptized in the flowing waters of the 
Jordan River. And there are some denominations for whom water quality is not an 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't mind the stuff that's in it," said Elder Joe Evans at the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Old Regular Baptists Called Sardis in Delbarton, W. Va. "It's 
not what baptism is all about -- to clean your body. . . . Jesus has nothing to 
do with pollution." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe God makes it pure when one of his goes in," said Elder John Thacker 
of the Philadelphia Old Regular Baptist Church at Pompey in Pike County, near 
the Kentucky-Virginia border. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said stream pollution is "a part of life" in Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got everybody up and down this creek running their sewers in it," he 
said. "What are you going to do? They've got no place else to put it. It's a 
vast problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem is not so widespread that it has caught the attention of 
national church leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first I've heard of it," said Jack Williams, convention 
coordinator of the National Assn. of Free Will Baptists in Antioch, Tenn. 
Others question whether it is a problem at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The act of baptism is so quick that there's not much exposure to it whatever 
you do," said Mark Coppenger, vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention 
in Nashville, which has 15 million members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "You lay them back into the water and lift them up," he said. "It's not as 
though you're immersed for a long period of time and can soak in whatever is 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the situation were recognized as a problem by the church hierarchy, 
ordering congregations to cease creek baptisms would have no effect, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Mike Baker, spokesman for the Church of God in Cleveland, Tenn., said 
the move away from the creek banks is more a natural progression than a public 
health matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would liken it with air conditioning," said Baker, who was baptized in 
flowing waters. "It just is much more convenient for year-round climate, of 
course for sanitary reasons. And it's also in a worship environment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But VanHoose said his decision to install a baptistery at his church followed 
an experience he had several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 VanHoose said he had pulled up to a creek and found a place that appeared deep 
enough for the ceremony. He waded in to make sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt some debris under my feet and I started trying to move it out of the 
way and in the process, without knowing it, I was moving debris out of a sewer 
line that was coming straight from a house," he said. "That'll cause you to 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 VanHoose realizes that creek baptism is deeply rooted in the traditions of his 
mountain home. "But when it gets to that point," he said of his sewage run-in, 
"we need to have a change of heart and see what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Caudill, of the Tom's Creek church, is more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say they want to be baptized like the Lord was," he said of some 
parishioners. "And I say, 'Get you a plane ticket and go to the Jordan River.'

VENTURA MAN HELD IN YEAR-OLD SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura police on Friday afternoon arrested a 19-year-old Ventura man 
suspected in the killing of a Santa Paula man more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect's name has not been released, police said, because he was a 
juvenile at the time of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Alfonso "Sammy" Garza Sanchez, 24, was found in the 200 block of 
an alley between Vince and Flint streets just before midnight Jan. 27, 1993. 
Sanchez, a meat cutter at a Ventura supermarket, died from multiple gunshot 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A warrant had been issued for the suspect's arrest, but Ventura police did not 
specify how long they had been looking for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Two officers spotted the suspect while they were patrolling near the new 
Montalvo storefront station. He was taken into custody without incident and is 
being held at Ventura County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also being held on a misdemeanor warrant for failing to appear in an 
unrelated case in which he is charged with being under the influence of a 
controlled substance.

SAMUELS IS CONVICTED ON 2 COUNTS OF MURDER; TRIAL: THE WOMAN IS FOUND GUILTY OF 
ARRANGING HER HUSBAND'S SLAYING IN NORTHRIDGE AND HIS EXECUTIONER'S DEATH SEVEN 
MONTHS LATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels, dubbed the "Green Widow" because she spent the $500,000 
estate she inherited from her slain husband at a dizzying pace, was convicted 
Friday of two counts of first-degree murder for arranging the husband's 
December, 1988, shooting death -- and his executioner's strangulation death 
seven months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, who had denied from the witness stand that she was involved in either 
killing, leaned heavily against defense attorney Phil Nameth but showed no 
other reaction as the jury returned the verdicts, reached after 18 days of 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the investigating officer, who spent the final years of his career 
building the case against Samuels, broke down and cried. Sitting just a few 
feet away from her former sister-in-law, Susan Conroy also wept. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what people say about black widows? Well, she's a green widow. It's 
the same thing as a black widow, which eats its mate when he's no longer useful 
to her," retired Los Angeles Police Detective George Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very cunning predator." 
</P>
<P>
 The seven men and five women on the jury will return to court July 11 to 
determine whether Samuels, 45, should receive the death penalty or spend the 
rest of her life in prison for the murders of Robert Samuels, 45, a Hollywood 
camera operator's assistant, and James R. Bernstein, 27, a reputed drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's shocked," Nameth said of Samuels' reaction to the verdict. "Now, it's 
time to get down to the business of saving her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the first-degree murder convictions -- which included the special 
circumstances of multiple murders and murder for financial gain -- the jury 
convicted Samuels of two counts of conspiracy and two counts of solicitation of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors deadlocked on two other counts -- attempted murder and solicitation -- 
and on a special circumstance that the hit man was slain for financial gain. 
Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff declared mistrials on those counts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the lengthy trial, which unfolded like a pulp novel, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jan Maurizi alleged that Samuels plotted to have her husband killed when she 
realized "he was worth more to her dead than alive." 
</P>
<P>
 As a divorcee, Samuels would have received a settlement worth about $30,000. 
But as a widow, she inherited $500,000. She spent nearly all the money during 
the 13 months she was under investigation -- on a Porsche, a Cancun condo, a 
country club birthday bash, rented limousines, fake fur coats, trips to Las 
Vegas and custom-made outfits from a store called Trashy Lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she didn't pay for her husband's headstone, defaulted on her mortgage and 
failed to pay debts rung up by the family's Sherman Oaks sandwich shop, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Mary Ellen Gurnick, known by the nickname "Betty Boop" as she grew 
up just a few doors away from her future husband in Santa Ana, smiled and 
winked at spectators as the trial began, but appeared haggard as testimony drew 
to a close two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the key prosecution witnesses once were among Samuels' closest 
confidants. They described Samuels' search for a hit man and several botched 
attempts on her husband's life. Some of the former friends testified under 
grants of immunity from prosecution for their roles in the murder schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad part of this case is there were so many victims" besides the two men 
slain, Maurizi said. "Just about anybody whose life she touched became a 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, who worked on the films "Lethal Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," 
was ambushed in his Northridge home Dec. 8, 1988, by an intruder who hit him 
over the head, then shot him with a 16-gauge shotgun, firing through a pillow. 
Samuels and her daughter, Nicole, then 18, told police they discovered the body 
when they dropped off a pet schnauzer for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, who carried a business card identifying himself as a "specialist," 
was strangled to death on June 27, 1989, and his body was dumped in remote 
Lockwood Canyon, in Ventura County. According to testimony, the killers drove 
Samuels' black Toyota Celica convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters on the car's vanity plate were NAST VXN, for "nasty vixen." 
</P>
<P>
 The confessed killers, Paul Edwin Gaul and Darrell Ray Edwards, testified for 
the prosecution under plea bargains. Under the arrangement, both pleaded guilty 
to second-degree murder and received sentences of 15 years to life in prison. 
Gaul testified that he drank 30 to 40 beers the day they killed Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Nameth suggested that Samuels was framed by an overzealous detective and 
"fair-weather friends" who accused her to spare themselves from prosecution for 
their own roles in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Those witnesses painted an unflattering portrait of Samuels as a crass woman 
who hired male strippers for her daughter's 18th birthday and flirted with 
police the night she discovered her husband's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like bald guys," she told one detective, rubbing his hairless head, 
according to testimony. Later, however, she was not so friendly toward police. 
Several witnesses testified that she taught a pet parrot to make profane 
remarks about detective Daley. 
</P>
<P>
 Her trial played like a movie of the week, tracing a story line of puppy love 
among childhood neighbors that soured into deceit and betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, Mary Ellen and Robert Samuels grew up a block apart, 
and he had always been sweet on her. They met again in late 1979, following her 
failed first marriage, and wed in 1980. She left him six years later, leaving a 
"Dear John" note on the kitchen table, complaining that the marriage had gone 
"stale." 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens or what you think of me now or later, I will still 
always care for you, we just can't live together," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels and her daughter testified that Robert Samuels abused them, but their 
stories were uncorroborated by evidence, and she did not include abuse among 
her list of complaints in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Until two months before his death, Robert Samuels hoped they might reconcile, 
confiding to a friend that he was reading the self-help book "How to Save Your 
Marriage," according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then, testimony showed, Samuels and her daughter already were searching 
for someone to kill him. Several of Nicole's high school friends testified that 
she had asked if they knew where she could find a gun to kill her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months of her husband's death, Samuels took up with a new boyfriend, a 
concert promoter named Dean Groover who photographed her in a Cancun hotel 
room, wearing only $20,000 in cash and a smile. The photograph became a 
memorable piece of prosecution evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels denied she'd lived in the fast lane after her husband died. She 
testified that she "paid bills" with the insurance money, denying that her 
lifestyle changed. Later she conceded, "Naturally, I got to do more things." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Samuels-Moroianu also testified on her mother's behalf, even though 
prosecutors consider her an unindicted co-conspirator. She said Robert Samuels 
raped her, beginning when she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 During one court recess while Samuels-Moroianu was on the stand, the defendant 
smiled and mouthed the words, "I love you," to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love you more," Samuels-Moroianu responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi said prosecutors are still considering whether to file charges against 
the daughter.

GRAND JURY INDICTS COUPLE, SON IN CREDIT CARD SCHEME; CRIME: THEY ARE ACCUSED 
OF USING CONFIDENTIAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT COUNTRY CLUB MEMBERS TO 
OBTAIN AT LEAST $250,000 IN CASH AND GOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A federal grand jury has indicted a Canyon Country couple and their 
28-year-old son, accusing them of fraudulently obtaining at least $250,000 in 
cash and goods with credit cards issued in the names of more than 50 members of 
a Porter Ranch country club. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those indicted was Elissa Adlard, 59, a secretary at the Porter Valley 
Country Club who allegedly used confidential financial information about 
members to obtain the credit cards used in the fraud scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Adlard, her husband, James, 62, and the couple's son, Thomas, a business 
office manager in Fresno, were arrested Thursday by Secret Service agents after 
indictments were issued by a federal grand jury in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a middle-aged motherly type," club General Manager Ray Hazzard said 
of Elissa Adlard. "It was a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The club has about 1,000 members and is owned by Dallas-based Club Corp. of 
America, which owns 250 private membership clubs including the Braemar Country 
Club in Tarzana and the City Club in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, the Adlards also fraudulently obtained loans to buy 
two houses -- one in Canyon Country, the other in Fresno -- using proceeds from 
the credit card scheme as cash down payments and lying about Thomas Adlard's 
employment history on loan documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard said club members, who pay a $12,500 one-time entry fee and annual 
dues of $3,300 to belong to the 25-year-old club, are only now learning of the 
fraud scheme which may, at least temporarily, complicate their credit ratings 
if their names were used in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very frustrating not to be able to tell them," Hazzard said. "But we 
were told not to by the agents." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard said he had been told at least eight months ago about the federal 
probe's focus on Elissa Adlard. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. William Hahesy of Fresno said law enforcement officials 
will be preparing a notice that will be sent to the club's members urging them 
to do credit checks on themselves to see if their names had been used in the 
fraud scheme. By doing so, members can start straightening out their credit 
ratings and help authorities further pin down the extent of the scheme, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the money lost, that's the credit card companies' problem. "They're the 
one's left holding the bag," Hahesy said. According to Hahesy, Elissa Adlard 
got Social Security numbers and bank account information about members from 
club records and then used that material to obtain a slew of credit cards, 
including ones issued by Discovery, Wells Fargo Bank, the Broadway, Texaco and 
First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Adlards, federal authorities alleged, had the cards and subsequent 
statements mailed to mail drops or vacant houses which they had access to 
during the two years they ran the scheme. The family used the cards to obtain 
cash, either through ATM machines or through the convenience or courtesy checks 
issued by some credit card companies, and deposit it in accounts they set up 
under aliases. The family would make minimal monthly installment payments to 
keep their credit card accounts open. 
</P>
<P>
 After operating the scheme for a while, the family purchased two homes using 
the cash proceeds to obtain loans from Home Savings of America and from North 
American Mortgage Co., federal authorities alleged. To buy the Fresno house, 
for example, Thomas Adlard allegedly used $23,574 obtained from the credit card 
scam and borrowed another $99,150 from North American.

VILLARAIGOSA RESIGNS MTA TO CAMPAIGN; TRANSPORTATION: CANDIDATE FOR 45TH 
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT LEAVES POSITION AS ALTERNATE ON BOARD TO CONCENTRATE ON 
PREPARING FOR NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antonio Villaraigosa, the Democratic candidate for the 45th Assembly District, 
has stepped down from his post as an alternate on the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa has served as county Supervisor Gloria Molina's proxy on the 
board since the MTA was created last year through the merger of the Los Angeles 
County Transportation Commission and the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District. Before that, he was Molina's appointee on the RTD board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors have swirled that Molina asked Villaraigosa to resign, angered by 
meetings between Villaraigosa and some of Molina's political rivals. But 
Villaraigosa insisted Thursday it was his decision alone to step down effective 
Friday, the start of the MTA's new business year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting ready for my general election, so I figured July 1st was a good 
day to make (a resignation) effective," he said. "There are a lot of rumors out 
there, but the bottom line is that (Molina) never communicated to me that she 
wanted me to leave, in writing or verbally. People know that I've been a 
trusted alternate." 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa said he had considered, but ultimately decided against, staying 
on until November to see through the current debate over whether to raise bus 
fares. As Molina's appointee, he was the chairman of the MTA board's fare 
restructuring committee and a staunch opponent of any fare hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antonio Villaraigosa's tenure on the MTA board proved to be a real asset for 
the residents of Los Angeles County," Molina said in a prepared statement 
Thursday. "He was a particular advocate for bus riders, constantly working to 
assure quality service to those residents that rely on mass transportation for 
their livelihood,"  
</P>
<P>
 "His service will be missed, but I understand he wanted to concentrate on the 
November election." 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa said he would continue to speak out on the bus fare issue but 
acknowledged that his influence might be dimmed somewhat because of his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I would have been a more effective advocate" as an alternate on the MTA 
board, he said. But "it looks like a majority of the board is looking at 
(supporting) a fare increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Villaraigosa won a bitter primary battle in the 45th Assembly 
District, which stretches from Mt. Washington to Echo Park and includes 
portions of Boyle Heights and Hollywood. In winning the primary, he captured 
50% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina endorsed Villaraigosa in the primary against opponent Bill Mabie, who 
was backed by Molina's rival, Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa is virtually assured of victory in the November general election 
because Democrats make up 62% of the district's registered voters. During the 
primary, he touted his support for bus riders as one of his top achievements.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO CHARGES OF ROBBERY AND 
KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A Saugus man pleaded guilty Friday to robbery and kidnaping charges for 
holding a bank officer and her family hostage overnight last year in the Santa 
Clarita Valley and then forcing the woman to open her bank to steal more than 
$100,000, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, Chad Pelch, 23, admitted to forcing Toula Demosthenous to open the 
doors of the TransWorld Bank in Canyon Country, allowing him and two other men 
to steal the money, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleased with the conviction as the appropriate disposition of the case," 
said Assistant U.S. Atty. David R. Fields, who is handling the case. "I thought 
he might go to trial but it is never a surprise when someone pleads guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Pelch and Alex Yepes, 25, of Valencia were arrested in February for the 
robbery and kidnaping of Demosthenous and eight others, including five 
children. Two other men were involved in the robbery, officials said, including 
Pelch's older brother, Brett, 26, of Valencia, who is still at large, and 
Darren Towers, 25, of Saugus, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy, armed bank 
robbery and use of a firearm during a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Yepes will go to trial on Oct. 11 for that robbery and a similar one in the 
San Fernando Valley in which he, Brett Pelch and Towers are charged with 
kidnaping a Winnetka woman and her family last September and forcing her to 
open Coast Federal bank in Northridge the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Sallee, 26, of Santa Clarita, the fourth man allegedly involved in the 
robbery, is still at large, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields said Chad Pelch was not involved in the second robbery.  
</P>
<P>
 Pelch is facing 10 years to life in prison for the kidnap-robbery and will be 
sentenced on Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crime that Chad was involved in was particularly traumatic because it 
involved taking an entire family as well as four teen-age friends of the 
children," Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields said a plea agreement was reached with Pelch, but prosecutors "didn't 
offer him much." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they dropped a single firearms charge.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; THE GOAL-DUST TWINS; WITH ROMARIO AND BEBETO 
AT FORWARD, BRAZIL POSES A BIG PROBLEM, BUT AS MANY WILL ATTEST, IT'S NOT 
ALWAYS FOR THE OTHER TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The forward is poised in front of a Brazilian flag, set to strike a ball that 
appears as if it will explode through the page of the magazine. The words with 
the advertisement read: "The mood of a country usually swings with the economy. 
The mood of Brazil swings with Bebeto's right foot." 
</P>
<P>
 But before you rush out in pursuit of the advertiser's product, consider this 
scene: 
</P>
<P>
 In the path leading from the field to the dressing rooms at Stanford Stadium, 
a stage has been constructed from which players and coaches can deliver words 
of wisdom to the world's soccer media.  
</P>
<P>
 That is what Bebeto is doing, articulately explaining the finer points of 
Brazil's 2-0 victory over Russia in the World Cup's first round, when his 
partner at forward, Romario, saunters past. Suddenly, Bebeto is alone as dozens 
of Brazilian reporters turn and follow Romario up the stairs and to the door of 
the team bus, where he finally bestows on them two sentences before 
disappearing inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any question about who is the man among the boys from Brazil? As 
Brazilians say, each team needs a singing rooster, and on the team that will 
meet the United States at Stanford Stadium in the second round Monday, it is 
Romario de Souza Faria 
</P>
<P>
 who sings. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, which have been few and far between at the team's heavily 
secured Villa Felice headquarters here, he has admitted that he is an egotist 
and selfish. But as the player most relied on by his teammates to score, he 
says -- almost apologetically -- he must assume those characteristics to be 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is a role, it is one he relishes. He seeks attention with the same 
intensity he seeks a seam in the defense -- getting married in 1988 to his 
17-year-old girlfriend while standing on a local stadium's penalty spot in a 
ceremony that was televised live, calling living legend Pele senile and "a 
museum piece" and convening a news conference to announce his refusal to sit in 
his assigned seat next to Bebeto on the team plane. Besides, he said, he wanted 
a window seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Romario often offers unsolicited advice to his coaches about who 
should and should not be playing, he acknowledges that Bebeto belongs alongside 
him in Brazil's lineup. That does not mean Romario has to like him. 
</P>
<P>
 They are unrelenting rivals in Spain's first division, where Romario, 28, 
plays for traditional power FC Barcelona, and Bebeto, 30, for upstart Deportivo 
de La Coruna.  
</P>
<P>
 But the rivalry began more than a decade ago, when they were correctly 
identified as two of Brazil's rising stars, and, according to team officials, 
stemmed from a personality clash. 
</P>
<P>
 For evidence of that, look no further than their lifestyles in Spain. Bebeto 
is a devoted family man who brought his housekeeper from Brazil to Spain so 
that the lives of his wife and children would not be so greatly disrupted when 
he moved there to play. Romario also is married and has two children, but he 
and his best friend, Barcelona teammate Hristo Stoichkov of Bulgaria, are 
vigorous participants in the city's midnight-to-dawn nightclub scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in recent kidnap incidents in Brazil involving the families of both 
players, Romario's was more dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Reputed mobsters tried to kidnap Bebeto's wife and brother, but five others 
actually did abduct Romario's 62-year-old father, Edevair Souza de Faria. 
Demanding $7-million ransom, they held him for six days before they were caught 
by police. Not only did they not harm him, they provided him with a mattress, 
cold beer and a television so he could watch his son play a game in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 But although it is convenient for the media to paint contrasting pictures of 
the two strikers, they are not so different as it appears on the surface. 
Romario flaunts his impoverished childhood, speaking often of the Rio de 
Janeiro favela -- shantytown -- where he grew up and the coins he earned by 
washing car windshields at stop lights. Jose (Bebeto) Roberto Gama de Oliveira 
does not talk as much about it, but he also grew up poor in the provincial city 
of Salvador de Bahia. 
</P>
<P>
 Both also are secure enough in their talents to speak out against their 
coaches. After leading Brazil to the silver medal in the 1988 Summer Olympics, 
they protested bitterly when Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni used them for a combined 
total of only 72 minutes during the 1990 World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto was so put off by Lazaroni's successor as the national coach, Paulo 
Roberto Falcao, that he quit until a new coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, was 
hired. The injured party then was Romario, whose complaints when left out of 
the lineup for an exhibition game against Germany were so divisive that 
Parreira suspended him for nine months. Brought back to the team for the final 
World Cup qualifying game against Uruguay, Romario scored both goals in a 2-0 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to score is something else Bebeto and Romario have in common. 
After Bebeto led Spain's first division in 1992-93 with 29 goals, Romario led 
last season with 30. In the first round of this World Cup, Romario had three of 
Brazil's six goals and precipitated another when he was fouled in the penalty 
area. Bebeto has one goal and one assist, but at least one opponent thinks he 
is a more valuable player than Romario. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bebeto can do more," Cameroon defender Samuel Ekeme Ndiba said after a 3-0 
loss to Brazil. "He can create things with his dribbling and crossing passes. 
He's more athletic. He is more than just a goal getter." 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto, 5 feet 10 and 145 pounds, is quick, agile and so adept with the ball 
that Pele has suggested he should be the play-making midfielder. If he has a 
weakness, it is that defenders can knock him off the ball -- if they can catch 
him. When they do, he often whines to the referee. Romario stuck him with the 
nickname " Chorao " -- Crybaby. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario, in contrast, stands only 5-6, but he weighs 154 pounds and cannot be 
pushed around. His weakness is that he seldom will go searching for the ball, 
but when it comes to him he can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand there," he says, "pretending I am dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira calls him "the king of the penalty area." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly contrite after his suspension, Romario still advises Parreira on the 
lineup. When Pele recently said that Romario should let the coach coach, 
Romario responded by calling Pele "mentally retarded." 
</P>
<P>
 But Parreira has learned to let Romario be Romario. The forward, who says that 
practicing is a waste of calories, was excused from the team's final training 
camp before leaving for the United States because he wanted to play volleyball 
on the beach with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked recently if Romario is a problem, Parreira said, "Yes, he's a big 
problem -- for the other team." 
</P>
<P>
 Romario has tried hard to become a team player for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I am a difficult guy," he says. "It's because I'm authentic. I say 
what I think to your face. But the other players like me because they know that 
if Romario does well, the team will get results. I've been telling everybody 
that I'm ready to give my blood for this Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he has fit in well with his teammates, playing drums for their 
improvisational samba band. As long as he continues scoring, it does not matter 
if he marches to a different conga.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; ANALYSIS; NOW FUN REALLY BEGINS; SECOND ROUND: 
WITH SUDDEN-DEATH ELIMINATION, TEAMS CAN'T AFFORD TO COAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officially, the 1994 World Cup began at Soldier Field two weeks ago, when 
Oprah Winfrey fell on her face and Carlos Leonel Trucco fell on another part of 
his anatomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficially, it begins today, and from now on falls from grace will be a lot 
more painful. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfrey's abrupt exit from the opening-ceremony stage was the cause of mild 
amusement on June 17, especially when it was learned she had injured nothing 
more serious than her dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Trucco's pratfall caused amusement of another kind, especially in 
the German camp, since it allowed Juergen Klinsmann to score the tournament's 
opening goal and started Bolivia on its way home. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, seven teams have joined the Bolivians in making an early exit from 
the World Cup, the most notable of these being Colombia, whose decaffeinated 
performance was not worth a hill of beans, coffee or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves 16 nations still in the running for international sport's most 
coveted trophy. By Tuesday night, that number will have been cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is the round it really gets going," Klinsmann said earlier this week. "In 
the (first-round) matches, you tend to take it easy. You don't go into the 
duels as hard because you know if you get injured you don't get through the 
World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 That will not be the case in the second round. From now on, it's win or catch 
a cab for the airport. There are no more ties, no more appallingly dull, 
foul-plagued exhibitions such as Thursday's Bulgaria-Argentina disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Games that are all square at the end of 90 minutes will be extended for 30 
minutes of overtime. If that doesn't end the tie, penalty kicks will, starting 
with the best of five, then going to sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the most pleasant way to be eliminated from the World Cup -- as 
top-notch teams such as France, Brazil and Italy will attest, having been 
penalty-kick victims in the past -- but it does make for some dramatic 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are, at least one of the remaining teams will have been beaten on 
penalties by the time the eight second-round games are complete Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 teams include four former World Cup winners -- Argentina, Brazil, 
Germany and Italy -- and the only four unbeaten teams after the first round of 
36 matches -- Brazil, Germany, Spain and Sweden. They also include two teams -- 
Nigeria and Saudi Arabia -- playing in their first World Cup and another, the 
United States, playing in the second round for the first time since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 The pairings have produced some formidable games, not the least of which is 
today's clash between defending champion Germany and its strongest opponent to 
date, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the outgoing world champions and I know they are afraid of us," 
Michael D'Hooghe, president of the Belgian soccer federation, said when the 
team left Brussels for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might not be stronger than others, but then again the others are not any 
stronger than we are," added midfielder Enzo Scifo, the Belgian captain. "We 
can take on any team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgians proved that in the first round when they held a technically 
superior Dutch team scoreless in a 1-0 victory at Orlando, Fla. That, combined 
with a 1-0 defeat of Morocco, meant that Belgium's surprising 1-0 loss to Saudi 
Arabia in the third game was nothing more than that, a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most intriguing aspects of today's game will be the battle between 
Klinsmann, who has scored four goals and needs two more to catch leading scorer 
Oleg Salenko of Russia, and Belgium's Michel Preud'homme, far and away the best 
goalkeeper in the tournament so far. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the field, Belgium's Croatian-born striker Josip Weber, 
who has yet to hit full stride, will be testing the increasingly shaky German 
defense, which will have yet another new look now that Stefan Effenberg has 
been sent home in disgrace for his sign-language message to the crowd in 
Dallas, where Germany clung to a 3-2 victory over South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 This game could go either way and the winner will have to face nothing more 
fearsome than Mexico or Bulgaria in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's second game, between Switzerland and Spain in Washington, is equally 
difficult to call. Neither team has risen to any great heights and neither has 
a player who has seized the tournament by the throat and made it his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, both are fairly ordinary teams that are in the second round thanks 
more to the weakness of their first-round groups than to any exceptional effort 
on their own part. 
</P>
<P>
 The inconsistent Swiss were tied by the United States in their opener while 
still staring at the Pontiac Silverdome roof, then humbled Romania before 
falling to a resurgent Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain, meanwhile, survived the loss of team captain Miguel Angel Nadal for two 
games after his expulsion in the opening-day tie with South Korea and went on 
to tie Germany on an admittedly fluke goal before beating Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's first game pits the surprise team of the World Cup, Saudi Arabia, 
against the tournament sleeper, Sweden, at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the Swedes' first exposure to really intense heat, their first 
game having been played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and their next two at the 
Silverdome. The Saudis, on the other hand, will not be overly troubled by the 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tomas Brolin and Martin Dahlin, Sweden has scorers who could break open the 
game at any time. But the Saudis have speed that can stretch the Swedish 
defense and are sky-high after beating Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's accomplishments have been largely overlooked. The nightmare of 1990 
-- three games and three losses in Italy -- has been put to rest. A third-place 
finish in the 1992 European Championship and only a single loss in 10 
qualifying games indicate that Coach Tommy Svensson knows exactly what he is 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 That Svensson could cook up a game plan to tie the hitherto unstoppable 
Brazilians suggests his team will be more than the Saudis can handle. 
</P>
<P>
 But this has been a tournament of upsets. As German Coach Berti Vogts pointed 
out this week, "The gap (between teams) is no longer as wide as it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The second game Sunday easily could turn into a repeat of Thursday night's 
fiasco. Once again, it features Argentina, a team shattered by the loss of 
Diego Maradona because of a failed drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentines' opponent at the Rose Bowl will be Romania, a team not unlike 
the Bulgarians but with perhaps a shade more World Cup pedigree. Romania was 
one of the unfortunate teams to be ousted on penalty kicks four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the 1990 tournament, it played Argentina in a cynical, foul-ridden 
game in Naples that ended in a 1-1 tie. The absence of Maradona normally might 
be enough to give the edge to Romania this time but for the fact that it too is 
missing a star, Florin Raducioiu, who is serving a suspension after picking up 
two yellow cards in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Bulgaria on Thursday, the Argentines produced their usual theatrics, 
diving at the merest hint of a challenge, writhing about as if they had been 
shot and generally fooling Tunisian referee Neji Jouini, who was well out of 
his depth and showed it. On one occasion, the television camera caught forward 
Gabriel Batistuta spitting at a Bulgarian player. 
</P>
<P>
 The Romanians have a chance to win Sunday's game and put the tournament out of 
its misery by sending the rest of the Argentines home to join Maradona. But 
they will have to be very careful. It is unlikely that the Argentines again 
will miss the scoring opportunities they squandered on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday brings potentially the most historic doubleheader in American soccer 
history -- Ireland against the Netherlands in Orlando and the United States 
against Brazil in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Citrus Bowl was a sea of green when the Irish played there in the 
first round and awash in orange when the Dutch came to town. What it will look 
like with both teams' fans there staggers the imagination. Bring sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be hot, it will be humid, it will be fiercely fought and it very well 
could be decided on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ireland and Holland met in Palermo in the first round of the 1990 
tournament, the Dutch took an early lead and continued to attack while the 
Irish defended and eventually earned a tying goal late in the game. That 
pattern will be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 But two elements will be missing Monday -- the two scorers from 1990, 
Holland's Ruud Gullit and Ireland's Niall Quinn. The 1-1 tie four years ago 
also produced something else that the Dutch, in particular, will want to erase 
from their memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the tie, the teams had to draw straws to see which finished second 
in the group and which finished third. Ireland won, went on to play Romania and 
eventually reached the quarterfinals. Holland lost, had to play West Germany 
and was ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams have suffered in the Florida heat, but Ireland Coach Jack Charlton 
has complained about it a lot more than the Netherlands' Dick Advocaat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish are playing to the best of their ability, whereas the Dutch have yet 
to fulfill their considerable promise. Dennis Bergkamp should have been 
challenging for the scoring title by now, but he has only one goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch will find the Irish defense every bit as difficult to penetrate as 
the Belgian defense was, but it seems unlikely that they can create as many 
chances as they did in that game and again come away empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans, meanwhile, could be Ireland's secret weapon. The Dutch have their 
outrageous costumes and their brass band in the stands, but the Irish fans are 
every bit as passionate in their support. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make a difference," Irish goalkeeper Pat Bonner said. "They enjoy 
themselves. They're not there probably having too much expectation. They're 
there just to enjoy themselves and so far everything's gone well for them. It's 
a big holiday for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Also wanting to celebrate another kind of holiday -- Independence Day -- the 
Americans travel to Palo Alto knowing they have never beaten Brazil and if they 
do so they will have taken the most attractive and popular team out of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States' victory over Colombia was a tremendous and unforgettable 
achievement, but a victory over Brazil would make it pale into insignificance 
by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not going to happen. Brazil is an altogether different team than 
Colombia. Whereas Colombia was predictable, Brazil is innovative. Improvisation 
is the hallmark of Brazilian players, who can be counted on to do the 
unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia attacked down the middle and only down the middle. Brazil will attack 
from every position on the field. If the ball is in the Americans' half, watch 
out. This is not the best Brazilian team ever assembled and even Pele has 
pointed out what he regards as deficiencies in its starting lineup, but in 
terms of raw talent, it stands head and shoulders above the U.S. squad. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic has achieved his miracle for 1994 and should be 
able to rest on his laurels for another four years. This World Cup has Brazil's 
name stamped on it and no amount of American pluck, grit, determination, work 
or even luck is going to erase that. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years to the day after being awarded the World Cup, the United States will 
see it taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the United States from the tournament need not necessarily be the 
end of North American involvement in the World Cup, however. 
</P>
<P>
 One Tuesday, the final pair of second-round games includes Mexico playing 
Bulgaria in a match it very easily could win. Before that, however, there is 
the intriguing prospect of Nigeria-Italy at Foxboro Stadium near Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians have come and seen but they have not conquered. Scraping into the 
second round as a third-place team is not what Coach Arrigo Sacchi had in mind 
when he set out for the New World, and the Italian press has let him know its 
feelings in no uncertain words. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to pinpoint Italy's troubles, but an inability to function as 
a team seems to be foremost. The players all have individual skills and their 
experience playing in the toughest league in the world is evident. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no joy to the Italians' game, no free-flowing movement of the 
ball, no inspiration from those who should inspire, especially Roberto Baggio. 
It is as if the players are merely going through the motions. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Nigeria, they will have to do better than that. Coach Clemens 
Westerhof stated flatly before the tournament that Nigeria's goal in 1994 was 
to do better than Cameroon had done in 1990. Since Cameroon reached the 
quarterfinals, Nigeria will have to defeat Italy on Tuesday to have a shot at 
that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not beyond the bounds of possibility, and with nothing more than Spain 
or Switzerland facing the winner, even a place in the semifinals is within 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, though, it just seems time for the Italians to awaken and impose 
themselves on the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is Mexico. It plays badly depleted Bulgaria in the last 
second-round game at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 History is on Mexico's side. The teams met in the second round of the 1986 
World Cup and Mexico won, 2-0, in a game that featured one of the great World 
Cup goals of all time -- a scissors kick by Manuel Negrete that brought awed 
the crowd of 114,580. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians have been collecting yellow cards by the barrow load and will 
be minus the services of several key players. Two who will be there, however, 
are forward Hristo Stoichkov, whose three goals leave him in striking distance 
of the scoring title, and midfielder Krasimir Balakov, the team's most talented 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 If Coach Miguel Mejia Baron's team can stifle those two, and if forward Luis 
Garcia can retain his scoring touch and if goalkeeper Jorge Campos can keep 
luck on his side and if. . . . But the second round of the World Cup is always 
full of ifs, and the only sure thing is that in four days the eight 
quarterfinalists will be known. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage is set. There's no need for Oprah. In the next few days, eight teams 
will find a way to trip themselves.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; MILUTINOVIC MUST HAVE THE ANSWERS; AMERICANS: 
AS USUAL, HOWEVER, COACH ISN'T TELLING WHO WILL REPLACE SUSPENDED HARKES IN 
MIDFIELD AGAINST BRAZIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Way back in the good old days, in pre-Colombian times, it was nothing to talk 
to a player on the U.S. soccer team, ask a straight question and get a 
thoughtful, straight answer. The team's coach is not included in this scenario, 
of course, but he has always allowed his players to speak freely with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the post-Romanian era, the muzzle has been strapped on. Take, for 
instance, the simmering question of who will replace the suspended John Harkes 
in the midfield for the second-round game against Brazil. It's a reasonable 
question, but don't try asking any of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago it was appropriate for the players to discuss their positions and 
speculate on Coach Bora Milutinovic's tactics and decisions. Only talk, but it 
offered an insight on the team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, ask a question about the midfield situation and you will hear, "Whatever 
Bora decides. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Tab Ramos, one of the team's most engaging personalities, sidestepped, saying, 
"I don't think I want to answer that question." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos said it politely but firmly. And he did allow himself to be drawn into a 
discussion of what he would have to do personally against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to have the ball a lot," he said. "I have to hold the ball. I can't 
think of anything else. Obviously, for us to be successful it would be easy for 
me to say, 'I need to get the ball every time and score as many goals as I 
can.' I'll try." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Milutinovic whom he has in mind to replace Harkes, who received two yellow 
cards in the first round and must sit out one game, and get this response: "I 
don't like to tell in public." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact remains that the U.S. team must find a way to replace Harkes, one of 
the most experienced and creative players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic might choose to replace Harkes with a defense-minded midfielder, 
in anticipation of Brazil's offensive onslaught. Mike Burns might be 
considered.  
</P>
<P>
 Or, if creativity and holding the ball is deemed important, Milutinovic might 
give Hugo Perez his first start. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic also could drop Eric Wynalda back from the front and slot proven 
scorer Frank Klopas into the forward position. Or, he could put the speedy Cobi 
Jones on the wing. Or, he might get a few minutes out of Claudio Reyna, who is 
recovering from a torn hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the problems the U.S. team had moving the ball forward in its 
first and third games, a creative midfielder might be a good choice. Ramos, and 
others, have talked about how long it takes for the defense to work the ball 
out of the back. In the interim, the opposing team's defensive players have 
been able to move forward and pick up the U.S. attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Milutinovic has in mind for Monday, it's in his mind alone. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt he knows that he needs his team's full attention going into what will 
be its biggest game yet, facing Brazil in the second round of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough said.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; THE JEWEL OF THE EMERALD ISLE; JACK CHARLTON 
MAY BE ENGLISH AND HE MAY BE ROUGH CUT, BUT HE'S REVERED IN IRELAND AS A GEM OF 
A SOCCER COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is an Englishman who is revered in Ireland. That happens once every couple 
of centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Jack Charlton, and his heritage is overlooked by the faithful in 
Dublin and Shannon and Cork and Tipperary because he has brought new life to 
the passion of Ireland. He is coach of the Irish national soccer team, and he 
is good at it. 
</P>
<P>
 How good? 
</P>
<P>
 Before he took over in 1986, Ireland had never been in a World Cup tournament. 
Now, it has made its second consecutive advancement to the second round. With a 
victory over the Netherlands at Orlando, Fla., on Monday, it can match its 1990 
advancement to the Cup quarterfinals, in which it lost to Italy, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup '94 in the United States has been even sweeter than Italia '90 for 
Charlton and his aging team because Ireland finally won a Cup game. It was not 
just any Cup game, but a 1-0 score-settler over Italy. The Irish advancement to 
the second round in 1990 was via ties, followed by a victory over Romania on 
penalty kicks that set up the 1-0 quarterfinal against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ireland is back, and for that, Charlton is held directly responsible. And 
although Ireland has already voted him its most popular man and awarded him the 
Freedom of Dublin Medal, the city's highest honor, the Irish fans cannot 
idolize him enough. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's well conceived and well executed 0-0 result here with Norway, 
which left Ireland second in its group's final standings and eliminated Norway, 
the green-clad faithful would not leave before seeing their hero and saluting 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want Jack! We want Jack! We want Jack!" they chanted, the chorus bouncing 
off the rafters of a sold-out Giants Stadium, where Irish fans overwhelmed the 
scene and turned Norwegian rooters into a silent minority. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all the more significant because Charlton had not been on the sideline 
during the game. Instead, fined and suspended for the game by FIFA for arguing 
too strenuously over a slow substitution against Mexico in the June 24 game at 
Orlando, Charlton directed his team by telephone from a TV commentator's booth 
high above the field. 
</P>
<P>
 When Charlton finally reached the floor of the stadium through back tunnels 
and walked onto the field in response to the chant, it was as if St. Patrick 
himself had returned to walk the streets of Dublin. They cheered and they 
teared. He was their Jack, come to greet them. English heritage be damned. Must 
have been a mistake on the birth certificate, or maybe another English plot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the basement of the stadium, he met the press. The image met the legend. Or 
perhaps it was the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sorry for Norway, because theirs was a bit of bad luck, not being able 
to go with four points," he said. "But we are delighted for the people of 
Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 At 59, Charlton remains a pillar in both perception and reality. It is not so 
much that he is 6 feet 4, but the way he carries himself. He is not unlike the 
Cliffs of Moher that stand so strongly against the elements on Ireland's rough 
West Coast. Even in white shirt and green tie, he is stiff and strong, always 
looking down from above, with a ruddy complexion that furthers an image of 
rugged impenetrability. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his team's style of soccer, Charlton's personal style is direct. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked of his team's chances before the World Cup began, he said, "We have good 
players and a good method of playing. Now, we will just get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about an injury to midfielder Andy Townsend, he said, "He just tweaked a 
knee." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his controversial fine and suspension by FIFA that put him in the 
TV booth Tuesday, he said, "The little confrontation I had with FIFA, I still 
don't know what it was about, but it's over now. We're all smiling, we're all 
happy and we're getting on with the rest of the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 And when he kept being pestered by Mexican reporters last Friday about his 
thoughts on the relative effect the oppressive Orlando heat had on his team and 
Mexico's, he cut the news conference short by saying, "Look, you're going to 
write what you want, no matter what I say, so go ahead and write it. I'm going 
to go talk to the Irish press." 
</P>
<P>
 As a player, he spent his entire 21-year pro career with Leeds United in the 
English First Division, scoring 96 goals in 773 games. In 1965, he was English 
footballer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 He played on the 1966 and 1970 World Cup teams for England, and in a 
celebrated victory shared with teammate and brother Bobby, Jack Charlton helped 
England win the 1966 Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tremendous feeling, standing out on Wembley when the final whistle 
had gone and we'd won and thinking -- I'm a world champion," he told English 
writer Ashley Collie. "To come from the northeast of England, from a mining 
community, and have your brother Bobby on the same field . . . it was beyond 
our wildest dreams, but we did it. Nobody in the world can ever take that 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 If Ireland is ever to experience such a feeling in this World Cup -- and that 
remains a longshot -- it will be because of Charlton's presence. There is no 
disputing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did we miss Jack along the sidelines today?" said midfielder Ray Houghton, 
repeating a question. "We did, indeed. He's got this big, raspy voice, and you 
can always hear him yelling. No matter how big the stadium or how big the 
crowd, you can always hear him." 
</P>
<P>
 So Charlton has become, in the midst of World Cup fever and fervor, the voice 
of Ireland, as well as its heart and brain. Throw in his soul and the soccer 
faithful of Ireland will take that too. 
</P>
<P>
 The other parts? The English can have those.

TIMES POLL SHOWS 60% OF L.A. GETTING NO KICK FROM '94 CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll taken June 25-26, the eve and day of the U.S. team's 
pivotal game against Romania at the Rose Bowl, indicated that 60% of Los 
Angeles residents were largely uninterested in news of the World Cup, although 
the games had attracted the interest of more than half of younger Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 Poll results indicate that men were more interested than women, and that 
Latinos led other ethnic and racial groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll surveyed 1,023 city residents. The margin of sampling error is plus 
or minus four percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all respondents, 39% said they were following the World Cup very closely or 
somewhat closely, with 14% claiming to be following very closely. More than 
one-third said they weren't watching the World Cup at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cup is doing best in the youngest age group (18-29 year-olds), of which 
55% were interested, and 23% claimed the highest level of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one-quarter of respondents 45 and older were following very or 
somewhat closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Men greatly outpaced women in their interest. While 55% of men said they were 
following very or somewhat closely, only 25% of women did so. Only 5% of women 
respondents said they followed the World Cup very closely compared to 25% of 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one-quarter of all Latinos -- 28% -- were following very closely, 
with 29% following somewhat closely. Only 35% of whites said they were 
following very or somewhat closely, as did 23% of blacks. MATT WHITE

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; FALL FELT IN ITALY

 Maradona, who starred in Naples, is almost as much a soccer legend in Italy as 
he is in Argentina.  
</P>
<P>
 Front pages of Italian newspapers featured photos of Maradona and headlines 
like Corriere della Sera, the Milan daily, "Maradona, thrown out of the World 
Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 In a front-page commentary, "Stardust," there is little sympathy for the 
Argentine: "Now take him out of our sight. Basta (enough), please, with Diego 
Armando Maradona, with his strange ways, his eccentricities, genius and 
unruliness. . . . And, please, no more stories of the poor street boy who pays 
the price of the miseries of the Third World. Latin America is full of 
scugnizzi (street kids) who don't have a millionth part of the luck and talents 
that life has given Maradona, and yet they get through life with greater 
dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Carnevale, erstwhile Naples teammate of Maradona, says in La Stampa, 
"It will be a stupid error by doctors and Diego. Everyone was happy to have 
seen him back playing in grand style and he was also regaining stature from a 
human point of view." He adds hopefully, "The important thing is that it isn't 
cocaine."

 After learning midfielder Stefan Effenberg had agreed to sell his story of his

($38,000), a competing German newspaper came up with the following headline: 
</P>
<P>
 "Effenberg: From Middle Finger to Goldfinger." 
</P>

 Effenberg was sent home by the German team this week for making an obscene

 Ireland Coach Jack Charlton, who was suspended from his team's game against 
Norway because of "ungentlemanly conduct" in the previous game, is still 
unapologetic over his actions. 
</P>

 "I still don't know what I did," said Charlton, who grabbed the coat lapels of 
a FIFA official who tried to prevent him from sending two substitutes onto the 
field before the official recorded their arrivals. "But rules are rules. There 
are so many, you don't know which ones you're breaking." HELENE ELLIOTT

 This is what has happened in this country. A soccer game is a hotter ticket 
than a Grateful Dead concert in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what they're saying about Monday's second-round game between the United 
State and Brazil at Stanford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really off the wall. We're being flooded with phone calls for tickets," 
said Jim Brzowski, vice president of Mr. Ticket, which advertises itself as San 
Francisco's largest ticket broker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so busy that we're putting other things like tickets to see the 
Grateful Dead to one side and aren't concerned about any losses on that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Green of the Best Seat ticket agency in nearby Lafayette went even 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the biggest sporting event we've ever seen. Bigger than the Super Bowl, 
bigger than the World Series," he said.

 ESPN's best rating was 4.3 for the United States' 1-0 upset of Colombia, 
followed by a 2.9 for Ireland's 1-0 upset of Italy. The low was an 0.4 for the

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; THE SOCCER EXPERT; A GEM FROM 
THE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no shortage of impressive goals in the first round of the World Cup, 
including the acrobatic shot by Juergen Klinsmann of Germany against South 
Korea on June 27. But clearly the best goal was scored by Saeed Al Owairan, who 
beat five opponents on his way to giving Saudi Arabia a 1-0 victory over 
Belgium on June 29 and a place in the second round.Saudi Arabia was a 500-to-1 
shot to win the tournament. HOW THE GOAL UNFOLDED: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Hamzah Saleh comes up with an errant Belgian pass and sends the ball to 
Owairan, who takes it 40 yards from his goal and heads upfield. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Belgian defender Dirk Medved approaches from Owairan's left, but Owairan 
outruns him, avoids an opponent coming from his right and escapes a 
slide-tackle attempt by Medvd. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Belgium's Michel De Wolf approaches from the left, but Owairan skirts his 
slide-tackle attempt about 40 yards from the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Outside the penalty area, Owairan turns around defender Rudy Smidts, who 
was also trying to cover the right wing, and beats him toward the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Defender Philippe Albert, covering the left wing, has the last chance to 
stop Owairan, but he arrives too late and his slide-tackle attempt comes up 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Michel Preud'homme charges, but Owairan, while sliding, curls a shot over 
the goalkeeper and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Schematic of the play is not to scale.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; GERMANS NOT HITTING ON ALL CYLINDERS YET; 
SECOND ROUND: DEFENDING CHAMPIONS STRUGGLING ON AND OFF FIELD AS THEY PREPARE 
FOR BELGIUM TODAY.

 Chug, chug. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans have sputtered down this World Cup road before. Remember, this is 
a soccer team with a history of slow starts and fast finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing uninspired at times, Germany has nevertheless landed in the round of 
16 and is four victories removed from an unprecedented fourth World Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like a diesel motor," defender Juergen Kohler said. "It takes a while 
to get it warmed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there are signs of engine wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany did not raise many pulses in grinding out opening-round victories over 
Group C weaklings Bolivia and South Korea, and tying Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Often whining about the heat -- if you can't stand it, get out of the kueche 
-- the Germans are perhaps starting to show their average age of 29.4 years. 
They hobble into today's match against Belgium at Soldier Field with an injured 
captain, Lothar Matthaeus, a one-man offense, Juergen Klinsmann, and a 
shell-shocked goalkeeper, Bodo Illgner. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, theirs apparently is a house divided over the ouster of midfielder 
Stefan Effenberg, sent home by Coach Berti Vogts for making an obscene gesture 
to German fans after the team's game against South Korea last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogts left no room for negotiations, which upset some players, including 
captain Matthaeus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have argued with the football federation, but they gave us such a 
strong impression, that if the players protested, the president surely would 
have withdrawn the team from the whole tournament," Matthaeus told German 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Effenberg has sold exclusive rights to his story to a German tabloid, Sport 
Bild, for about $38,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogts can only wait for the headline: "Effenberg: Germany Should Say 'Bye-Bye 
Berti.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Known as "the Terrier" for his tenacious play as a former German defender, 
Vogts, 47, is a no-nonsense coach who must know he will never command the 
respect players and media have for his legendary predecessor, Franz 
Beckenbauer, who coached Germany to the 1990 World Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
 It cannot help matters that Beckenbauer is constantly lurking about, 
undermining Vogts somewhat with bold predictions about Germany's imminent World 
Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should not be taken seriously," Vogts said, trying to temper the hype. 
"There have been disappointments before. We have lost games." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, Germany has a few concerns: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Matthaeus, the team's heart and soul, had to leave the South Korea game 
after being spiked on his left foot. "Hopefully, he will be ready for 
Saturday," Vogts said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Klinsmann. The team's top striker has scored four of Germany's five goals, 
not exactly what you would call offensive balance. It remains unclear whether 
anyone else is capable of picking up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Illgner. The goalkeeper almost blew a 3-0 lead to South Korea and there was 
talk he might be replaced for the Belgium match. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogts, however, has given him the dreaded vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't talk about the past," Vogts said. "Bodo is our goalie."

WHILE WAITING FOR DODGERS TO CALL, HANSELL FINDS NICHE; BASEBALL: IN 
ALBUQUERQUE, FORMER KENNEDY HIGH RIGHT-HANDER MAKES TRANSITION FROM STARTER TO 
RELIEVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Greg Hansell watches and cringes. He can't help it and he's certainly not 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The faltering Dodger bullpen isn't fooling anyone, least of all club 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hansell, a right-handed relief pitcher, keeps waiting and wondering when 
he'll get his chance to turn around the Dodgers' fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 He can't do much right now because he's pitching for triple-A Albuquerque, 
polishing any remaining rough edges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansell, who led Kennedy to the Southern Section 3-A championship in 1989 
before turning pro, understands the Dodgers' thinking, but that doesn't mean 
he's content. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes they're watching him closely, yet he wonders what they're waiting 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 He also knows a major league players' strike might wipe out a sizable chunk of 
the season, but he wants to play in the big leagues now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strike or no strike, I want to pitch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the revolving bullpen door at Dodger Stadium hasn't helped ease 
Hansell's eagerness, only enhanced it. 
</P>
<P>
 He has seen other young pitchers, including Omar Daal, Darren Dreifort, Rudy 
Seanez, Ismael Valdes and even Chan Ho Park, get an opportunity to pitch for 
the Dodgers this season. But Hansell keeps waiting for his turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely feel confident with the way I've been pitching," he said. "I 
talked to the brass here and they think I'm ready. But I've got to stay focused 
down here. Hopefully, when they need somebody they'll give me a call." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Dodger General Manager Fred Claire expressed satisfaction with the 
job Hansell is doing at Albuquerque. But Claire also said he didn't want to 
make additional changes for changes' sake. In other words, baring injury or 
complete meltdown in the Dodger bullpen, Hansell can expect to stay in the 
minors a while longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have two things to pitch in the major leagues," said Charlie 
Blaney, Dodger director of minor league operations. "No. 1, you have to have 
the ability and No. 2, you have to have the opportunity. Greg's got the 
ability. Now, he's waiting for the right opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansell is determined to avoid a trap of resentment and bitterness, focusing 
instead on simply pitching well at Albuquerque. It seems to be working wonders 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 7-1 with a 3.74 earned-run average, 64 strikeouts and 18 walks in 84 
innings this season. His ERA is one of only a handful in the Pacific Coast 
League less than 4.00, an indication of his effectiveness in a notoriously 
hard-hitting league. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the weekend, no team had a batting average lower than Phoenix's 
.280. Salt Lake leads the league with a .313 average. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Hansell has emerged as a candidate for a promotion after 
mastering the transition from starter to long and middle reliever. It now 
appears that he has found his niche as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really comfortable there (in the bullpen)," Hansell said. "I'm putting 
some pretty good numbers up. It's the right situation for me to get a few wins 
under my belt." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Blaney: "We're very pleased. He really seems to have related to that 
role. He's confident and dominant. I think it's the right role for him. He 
seems so comfortable because he's performing so well. So much of the game is 
mental." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansell approached the Dodgers about switching to relief work during a winter 
spent pitching in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy Lasorda came to see me and I really started off well down there," 
Hansell said. "I was able to block out all distractions. I started off well and 
got into that grove. It all started down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks ago, the Dodgers granted Hansell his wish, moving him into the 
Albuquerque bullpen. It afforded him the chance to pitch more often, which also 
enabled him to quit mulling over his performance on the days between starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the change, he has also become a smarter pitcher, using his arm and his 
head to retire batters. His command is far better, according to Blaney, and he 
has worked to eliminate mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mistakes become earned runs real quick," Hansell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He always had a good, hard fastball, but recently has improved his changeup 
and developed a tough curveball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think after last year I've become more of a pitcher than a thrower," 
Hansell said. "I'm spotting the fastball well with a little more pop. I'm 
throwing the changeup for strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw well at (double-A) San Antonio. When I came up to Albuquerque I had a 
difficult adjustment because of the altitude and the quality of the hitters. 
Last year, I got into a rut rather than a grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was willing to try anything after last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The next logical step is a spot in the major leagues. When and where are out 
of Hansell's control, but he can force the Dodgers to act if he keeps throwing 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, when the break comes I'll capitalize," he said.

MARTINA SETS SIGHTS ON NO. 10; WOMEN: SHE IS FAVORED TO DEFEAT MARTINEZ FOR THE 
TITLE TODAY IN HER SINGLES FAREWELL TO CENTRE COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Martina Navratilova, making her final appearance on Wimbledon's Centre Court, 
will play Conchita Martinez today for the women's singles championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Navratilova, the oldest player in the draw, has made no secret 
of her feelings for Wimbledon. It is her favorite tournament, her favorite 
playing surface and her favorite singles title, which figures, because she has 
nine of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the lure of a 10th championship that has driven Navratilova from 
sentimental favorite to simply favorite, with no strings attached. She began 
the fortnight seeded No. 4, but as the result of a series of upsets -- No. 1 
Steffi Graf, No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario -- and Navratilova's own improving 
play, Wimbledon finds itself with an unlikely matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to absolutely enjoy every moment," said Navratilova, who will make 
her 22nd appearance at Wimbledon and her 12th visit to the final. "I think it's 
going to be a happy goodby either way. I'll have the chance to win one more 
Wimbledon. What more can I ask for?" 
</P>
<P>
 In No. 3 Martinez, she will face someone who is best known for her play on 
clay, not grass. Martinez holds a 3-1 edge over Navratilova, but all the 
victories were on clay courts. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Martinez's first Grand Slam event final, which is one reason the 
British oddsmakers have made Navratilova a 4-5 pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since 1928, when Lili de Alvarez did it, has a Spanish woman advanced to a 
Wimbledon final. If nothing else, Martinez has Spanish momentum on her side. 
Spain's Sergi Bruguera and Vicario recently won French Open championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Navratilova hasn't won here since 1990, when she defeated then-Zina 
Garrison for her record-setting ninth title. A victory over Martinez will move 
Navratilova into a second-place tie on the all-time Grand Slam singles list. 
She is now tied with Chris Evert with 18 championships, one fewer than Helen 
Wills Moody and six fewer than Margaret Court.

SOCCER REVOLUTIONARY WITH A MOUSE; WORLD CUP: WEST HILLS MAN DEVELOPS COMPUTER 
ANALYSIS SYSTEM THAT ENABLES U.S. TEAM TO CHART TENDENCIES QUICKLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Inside a nondescript condominium in the western end of the Valley, Zvi 
Friedman bangs away at a computer while a World Cup soccer game forms a 
backdrop on a nearby television.  
</P>
<P>
 It is the headquarters for an advanced soccer analysis system, and Friedman is 
surrounded by piles of computer-produced charts, one of which shows the key to 
the United States' stunning 2-1 upset of Colombia last week. 
</P>
<P>
 What began in the dreams of Friedman, a 59-year-old systems analyst from West 
Hills, has become a reality the U.S. soccer team could hardly do without. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion it's a revolutionary form of analysis," U.S. assistant coach 
Steve Sampson said. "To my knowledge it's never been used in any sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, who has played and coached soccer for 40 years, always wished he 
could get a computer to track and record every movement of the ball. But it was 
just a dream until he joined forces with Jon Kotas, a co-worker and computer 
whiz. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than 18 months, Friedman and Kotas designed a program and put it to 
use with the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
 By sitting in the stands or press box entering data as the game is played, the 
two are able to produce charts that show every pass. Or only the passes 
completed. Or only the passes made by one player. Or only the passes in a 
20-minute period. 
</P>
<P>
 The charts can show every shot. Or only one team's shots. Or only the shots in 
the first half. Or only the shots by one player. Or every pass that led to a 
particular shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting graphics look like uncooked spaghetti spread on a counter. But 
they are simple to translate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the beauty of it," said Kotas, who lives in Thousand Oaks. "You don't 
have to be a soccer expert to see what's going on. The trends are so obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sampson: "I think the best use for us is we're able to see tendencies 
over a 90-minute period that only a very good, professionally trained eye can 
see over a number of matches." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it doesn't even take 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman and Kotas recorded data at the Colombia game from the Rose Bowl press 
box, with Friedman looking through binoculars and calling out the numbers of 
the players who touched the ball and Kotas clicking a mouse, marking different 
spots on a computer-generated field. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime Friedman, clutching a handful of charts compiled in the first 
half, sprinted through rows of fans to hand the information to Sampson before 
the coach entered the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
 The charts showed that Colombia's Wilson Perez was attacking constantly on the 
right side of the field and not coming back to defend. They also showed that 
the United States was attacking almost entirely from the left side, the 
opposite side Perez was leaving unguarded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Ernie Stewart scored to give the United States a 
commanding 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball came down the right side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The charts also indicated that the Colombians were penetrating primarily from 
the middle, rather than the flanks. Seeing this, the U.S. players continued to 
clog up the inside, shutting down the Colombian attack and sealing one of the 
greatest upsets in World Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
 It also made a soccer fan out of Kotas, who had previously seen the project as 
just a computer-programming challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the best sports events I've seen in my life," he said. "It was 
up there with the Kirk Gibson home run (in the 1988 World Series), and the 1980 
Miracle on Ice." 
</P>
<P>
 If the victory over Colombia marked the coming of age of the revolutionary 
program, the birth must have been when Friedman and Kotas first discussed the 
possibility less than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman coached soccer at Cal State Northridge in the early 1970s and was an 
assistant coach for the Los Angeles Skyhawks of the now-defunct American Soccer 
League in 1976. He used to watch soccer games repeatedly on videotape, manually 
charting the ball movement on dozens of sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lifetime dream," said Friedman, speaking with the accent of his 
native Israel. "For 15 or 20 years, I had been thinking: 'How can coaches 
really see what they are doing and not just go on gut feelings?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kotas, 40, provided the necessary know-how to make it happen.  
</P>
<P>
 Each night after work -- he builds deep space power systems for an aerospace 
company -- Kotas would go home and spend an hour or two on his computer, 
creating the program, per Friedman's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotas started in April, 1993, and finished the program three months later. 
Friedman, who had met Sampson at a coaching conference, approached the U.S. 
assistant in September with his new product. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sampson) said, 'I can only spend an hour,' and he ended up spending three 
hours with (the program)," Kotas said. "He kept asking more questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman and Kotas then presented the program to the entire U.S. coaching 
staff in November and, said Friedman, "They flipped out." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair have been running the program with the U.S. team since, taping the 
games they could not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the computer and what Zvi is doing gives you a different look at the 
game," U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola said. "It certainly gives us a whole new 
perspective on what is happening. I think it will help us and I think, for our 
team, we'll take any advantage we can get." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman and Kotas, who have received inquiries about writing similar programs 
for other sports, demonstrated the soccer program at a coaching conference in 
January, and Brazilian Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira became intrigued with the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kotas and Friedman sold their services to the Brazilian national team as 
well. The U.S. team does not pay to use the program, but does pay Friedman's 
and Kotas' expenses, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, the United States is facing Brazil on Monday in the second 
round. But, by prior contractual arrangement, Friedman and Kotas will not 
provide Brazil any information on the United States during or before the game. 
But the pair headed down to the U.S. team's headquarters in Mission Viejo on 
Wednesday with a stack of charts on Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of odd," Friedman said, "but we were frank ahead of time with 
Parreira. We will help him in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone could be considered an expert on Brazil and the United States, it 
would be Friedman. Any predictions? 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody is going to win the World Cup, it should be Brazil with their 
great talent," he said. "But maybe, hopefully, the U.S. can pull off the upset 
of the century. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to the quarterfinals either way."

WHERE THEY ARE NOW: BUDDY BRADFORD; THEY PUT ON A PROFESSIONAL BLOCK PARTY; 
BASEBALL: FIVE PALS FROM THE SAME PACOIMA NEIGHBORHOOD SIGNED CONTRACTS, AND 
TWO OF THEM MADE IT TO THE MAJORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In bookmaking halls, the odds of five childhood friends from the same 
neighborhood block signing contracts to play professional baseball probably 
would be higher than Elvis going on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charles (Buddy) Bradford and some of his old pals from Pacoima know that 
sometimes longshots defy all reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 They know because many years ago, when the Valley was wide-open spaces 
interrupted here and there by fruit groves and small communities, it happened 
to them. It was amazing then and it's still incredible today, more than three 
decades later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five of us from that little area made it to the pros," said Bradford, a major 
league outfielder for 11 seasons before retiring in 1977, after playing one 
season in Japan. "We all grew up basically on Judd Street, between Bradley 
(Avenue) and Pala (Avenue)." 
</P>
<P>
 That block, just north of Van Nuys Boulevard and east of San Fernando Road, 
was home and playground to Bradford, brothers Curtis and Claude Fontenot, Bobby 
Mitchell and Gary Matthews. All became baseball standouts at San Fernando High 
and then minor league players, although only Bradford, who broke in with the 
Chicago White Sox in 1966, and Matthews, who started with the San Francisco 
Giants in 1972, reached the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 And as unlikely as it would be to generally find that much talent in one 
place, Bradford was not surprised when pro scouts flocked to the neighborhood, 
pens and contracts in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some real good athletes around there," Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That Bradford, who will turn 50 on July 25, knew what to do with some of the 
money he was paid for playing baseball is clear after one glance at his 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now owner of C&P Investments, a company that acquires apartment buildings, 
Bradford lives with his wife, Patricia, and 16-year-old daughter, Tambry, in an 
elegant home in the Ladera Heights section of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which Bradford and his wife bought in 1974, three years after they 
were married, includes a playroom above the garage with a pool table and 
mementos from his major league career. The large room doubles as his office. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a grand piano by the fireplace in the living room so Tambry, a senior 
at an exclusive all-girls prep school in Westwood, can sharpen her musical 
skills.  
</P>
<P>
 In the den, with sliding glass doors that lead to the backyard pool, photo 
albums show stills of the family on vacations to Hawaii and cruises to the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came up with the White Sox, some of the players were always 
talking about the stock market and investments," Bradford said. "Guys like Ken 
Berry and Wilbur Wood and Bob Locker would be in the training room every day 
talking about it, and that's how I got interested." 
</P>
<P>
 But, by his own admission, perhaps a bit much for his own good on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing with the White Sox the day after he graduated from high school 
in 1962, Bradford joined the club briefly in 1966 and '67 before staying for 
good in 1968.  
</P>
<P>
 However, he had a disappointing rookie season, hitting only .217 in 103 games. 
He got off to a flying start in 1969, leading both leagues in batting through 
the first month of the season with a .420 average, before fading and finishing 
at .256. 
</P>
<P>
 And although only 5 feet 11 and 170 pounds, Bradford hit a home run onto the 
roof at old Comiskey Park on April 25, 1969, becoming only the fourth White Sox 
player to achieve the feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Those outside interests, however, were already affecting Bradford, who by then 
owned a rest home in Arleta and co-owned, with teammate Tommy McCraw, a 
telephone answering service in Culver City.  
</P>
<P>
 He kept his eyes more on the businesses than the fastballs thrown to him by 
opposing pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got caught up in the investments and trying to survive outside of 
baseball," Bradford said. "I got distracted as a player. I wasn't focused on 
the game and I think that hurt me." 
</P>
<P>
 It did, to the point where the White Sox sent him to baseball purgatory -- 
Cleveland -- in June of 1970. He got word of the trade soon after completing a 
training stint with the National Guard at Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a platoon that was made up of athletes only. Rudy May, Clarence 
Williams, Tom Egan, Clyde Wright were in it," Bradford said. "I would have to 
go and train right in the middle of the season sometimes, but I thought it was 
a good break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned to appreciate what I had as a ballplayer by doing that. As a 
ballplayer, you get so pampered and spoiled because you think the world is 
going to cater to you all the time. It gave me a balance and perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't do anything for his hitting, however. One month into the 1971 
season, Bradford was batting .158 for the Indians when the club figured he 
belonged elsewhere in Ohio, so they shipped him to Cincinnati.  
</P>
<P>
 That arrangement lasted until the end of the season and Bradford was back in 
Chicago the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 As he had five years before, Bradford started fast in 1974 but crashed into a 
fence chasing a fly ball and broke his collarbone. It was an injury that 
sidelined him for several weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 He returned but tore a hamstring that put him out again and finished with a 
.333 average in 39 games. The bad breaks came when Bradford thought things were 
finally looking up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really coming back that season," Bradford said. "I was a little older 
and more focused. If I hadn't gotten injured, I think that it would have been 
the beginning of me putting a solid career together." 
</P>
<P>
 It became more like the beginning of the end. Bradford split time between the 
White Sox and St. Louis in 1975, returned to Chicago the following year and 
played with the Kintetsu Buffaloes in Japan in 1977 until he tried to steal a 
base and tore the same hamstring he injured three years before. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradford returned to Los Angeles, sensing his playing days were over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once back, and with a newborn daughter in the house, Bradford decided to get a 
job closer to home. His wife, a Superior Court reporter, suggested he become a 
U.S. marshal and Bradford agreed, working for a year as a bail officer in an 
arraignment court in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He left that position for personal reasons, became a minor league batting, 
running and outfield roving instructor for the Chicago Cubs, and then worked in 
a few other jobs -- mostly in the security industry -- before starting his real 
estate investment company with collateral from stocks he owned. 
</P>
<P>
 The modest success he found in baseball then parlayed into a comfortable 
living are far removed from his humble childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Mobile, Ala., Bradford moved with his family to Pacoima soon after his 
father died. Bradford was about 4.  
</P>
<P>
 An older brother had settled in the area after college and persuaded his 
mother to gather Buddy and his three sisters and head west. Bradford said the 
family loved the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice to be a kid growing up there," he said. "You could sleep on your 
own lawn when it was hot and nobody would bother you." 
</P>
<P>
 The block was filled with kids who passed their free time playing ball in the 
street or in empty lots, going to movies or swimming at the park.  
</P>
<P>
 Through those years, Bradford developed a bond with the guys who dared dream 
of becoming professional ballplayers and later would realize their ambition, 
some to a greater degree than the others. Mitchell remembers his friendship 
with Bradford. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pretty inseparable for a long time," recalled Bobby Mitchell, who 
went as high as triple-A ball with the Angels. "We used to double date, we 
worked out together. Sometimes, we would sit in a car for hours and just talk 
about life. He was always a pretty level-headed guy." 
</P>
<P>
 And an excellent athlete. At San Fernando High, Bradford played varsity 
baseball two seasons, was on the varsity track team two seasons and played 
halfback on the varsity football team his senior year. For him, they were 
memorable years. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Fernando High at the time was such a great school," Bradford said. "Those 
were some of the best years of my life. Those were unforgettable years. I'm 
sure glad I had them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradford, who preferred football to baseball, says he didn't have an 
overwhelming senior season and was a little surprised the White Sox, Dodgers 
and Minnesota Twins pursued him so actively. 
</P>
<P>
 "My senior season I hit only about .333, but I could throw real well and I 
could run real well, and I guess they thought I had a lot of raw talent," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which for the scouts back then were good enough odds.

SINGAPORE BUY OF ABBEY STOCK CALLED SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Health care industry observers expressed surprise at Abbey Healthcare Group 
Inc.'s announcement Friday that the government of Singapore has bought a 5.56% 
stake in the Costa Mesa-based provider of home health care services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It strikes me as really weird," said Jim McCamant, editor of the 
Berkeley-based Medical Technology Stock Letter."You hear about (foreign) 
governments investing in their own companies but not in companies in other 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers said that the Singapore government occasionally invests in 
U.S.-based companies through various funds associated with its national 
retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, for example, the Singapore government took an 8.3% interest 
in BWIP Corp., a Long Beach pump manufacturer. Singapore officials told BWIP 
that they were steered to the stock by a New York brokerage and intended to 
keep the stock as a long-term investment, a BWIP spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a filing made this week with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Singapore's government purchased 446,100 shares of Abbey common 
stock at prices ranging from $15.05 to $19.75 apiece, bringing its total Abbey 
holdings to 543,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading Friday, Abbey's stock jumped $1.375 to close at $16.50.

LONG BEACH BANK SELLS DEPOSITS TO HOME SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach Bank said Friday it has sold its $565 million in deposits to Home 
Savings of America and will close four branches as part of a move to reorganize 
as a mortgage banking company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange-based savings bank will sell its two branches in Long Beach to Home 
Savings of America and will close its branch offices in Beverly Hills, 
Pasadena, Tustin and Thousand Oaks.As a result, 47 of the bank's 867 employees 
could be laid off, said Jon Daurio, corporate counsel for Long Beach Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Savings of America's branches in nearby locations will service accounts 
of the closed branches. Daurio said some of the laid-off workers could be hired 
by Home Savings or the mortgage banking operation of Long Beach Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Bank's board decided it should operate as a mortgage banking 
company and no longer be a federally insured depository institution. It will 
change its name to Long Beach Mortgage Co. and keep its headquarters in Orange, 
Daurio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company expects that the stock of Long Beach Mortgage Co.'s parent company 
will ultimately be distributed to Long Beach Bank's shareholders in connection 
with the reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is subject to conditions such as the approval of the Office of Thrift 
Supervision and shareholders of Long Beach Bank. The deposit sale transaction 
is expected to close this fall.

DEVELOPER DEFAULT ON $62-MILLION BOND ISSUE SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A real estate development company is expected to default on a $62-million bond 
issue for the 2,290-acre Talega planned community near San Clemente, according 
to an official at the Santa Margarita Water District, which sponsored the bond 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lay, a board member for the district, said Friday that Chicago-based 
developer Arvida/JMB Partners Ltd. is not expected to make a $5.7-million bond 
installment payment that was due on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lay said the water district will likely have to foreclose on the undeveloped 
property. The Talega project was intended to be the site of 4,965 luxury homes 
with a nature preserve and two golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district ratepayers are liable for the $60.9 million in outstanding 
Talega bonds, which the district sponsored in August, 1990, to pay for water 
and sewage lines for the property. But ratepayers won't be affected, Lay said, 
because the district has bond insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has $5 million in a special reserve funded by Arvida/JMB, Lay said. 
Thus, the district can keep current on the bond payments for three years, he 
said. During that time, a buyer could be found for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 If that doesn't happen, the district, which is the priority lien holder on the 
property, could foreclose and recover its money by selling the property, Lay 
said.

STAYING AT CBS, STRINGER SAYS; TELEVISION: LONGTIME EXEC SAYS HE'S BEEN ASKED 
TO STAY ON BOARD BY BARRY DILLER, WHOSE IMPACT AS THE LIKELY NEW CBS BOSS IS 
SEEN AS MUCH BROADER THAN JUST PROGRAMMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 CBS/Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer said Friday that he's been asked 
to remain in his job after the proposed merger between CBS Inc. and Barry 
Diller's QVC Network. Stringer's plans have been the subject of speculation 
since CBS and QVC confirmed plans for a merger on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 "I will stay on as head of the broadcast group," Stringer said in an 
interview. "Barry has asked me to stay, and I look forward to working for him. 
This merger is about building the company, taking it into new directions. I've 
spent my whole career at CBS, and I'm excited about the new possibilities for 
the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer, who has been with CBS for 26 years, has 2 1/2 years remaining on his 
current CBS contract. He is credited with helping bring CBS from third to first 
place in prime time, and is considered a particularly smooth, effective liaison 
between the entertainment community and the business of broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospects for Peter Tortorici, who recently succeeded Jeff Sagansky as the 
network's programming chief, and for other CBS entertainment executives also 
have been the subject of industry buzz, with insiders wondering whether Diller 
will bring his own creative team to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry likes to bring in his own people, and Tortorici is not a known quantity 
to him," one CBS source said Thursday. "All the executives here are scrambling 
to figure out what their position is."  
</P>
<P>
 But Stringer said Friday that he expects Tortorici also to remain in his job. 
"Peter is my choice, and Barry wants him to stay," Stringer said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to believe that Diller, the former head of the Fox network, will not 
have strong ideas about programming the new CBS. But the precise impact of his 
new role as president, CEO and chairman of CBS under the proposed merger 
remains to be seen.  
</P>
<P>
 CBS rose to first place this season with older-skewing shows, but ABC came in 
a close second by appealing to younger viewers. The network is likely to add 
more younger-appeal shows, a move already started with some new programs 
already scheduled for the fall. But, said Stringer, who has lambasted Fox's 
urban-appeal shows in the past, "Barry is not running around saying we've got 
to get 18- to 22-year-old viewers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry is a pragmatist, and the shows at Fox filled a niche," said Richard 
Frank, who worked with Diller at Paramount Studios and is now president of Walt 
Disney Studios. "CBS has a profile, and he's not starting from scratch there." 
</P>
<P>
 Diller's impact, observers say, will be much broader than prime-time 
programming. He is expected to increase CBS' in-house production of TV series 
for cable and international distribution and to create a cable channel after 
years of being the lone holdout (under current CBS chairman Laurence Tisch) 
among the Big Three broadcast networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "CBS has made blunder after blunder, from not getting into the cable business 
to losing CBS stations (in a recent raid by Murdoch and New World 
Communications)," said Jessica Reif, an investment analyst with Oppenheimer Co. 
in New York. "CBS had to make a change. One of the obvious benefits of the 
merger is getting Diller, one of the great programmers and visionaries in 
television. I think he'll move CBS into diversified areas like cable and 
international partnerships." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS executives say privately that they are eager to move away from Tisch's 
"broadcast-only" strategy, which has made millions, but, critics say, has left 
CBS out of important new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems with CBS is that they've had a guy at the top (in Tisch) 
who's a financial genius but not a media genius," said Alan Bell, an 
Irvine-based broadcast-station executive who has served on the CBS affiliate 
board. "If Tisch had 50% less determination and 50% more insight into the 
creative community and the television business, it would have been better. I 
think Stringer and others were pulling against a weight when they convinced him 
to spend money on David Letterman or get into new areas. I think Diller will be 
much more supportive of new area. Diller is a shrewd assessor of market 
realities and an unconventional thinker. He'll look at CBS from a perspective 
that is unlike what others are thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Fuchs, the chairman of Home Box Office, praises Diller as a visionary 
but said in an interview that "a lot of the (reporting) on Barry as a 'genius 
programmer' over the past six months is overblown. It's not that he's not a 
creative programmer, but I don't find the Fox network to be so terribly 
brilliant in its programming, and I don't think TV programming is his strength. 
I think his real benefit to the company will be that he's a terrific 
businessman and strategist. He'll be much more aggressive than Tisch." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the enthusiasm for the new merger in the entertainment and financial 
communities, the deal raises a major question for CBS News: How deep is 
Diller's commitment to expensive, traditional news-gathering?  
</P>
<P>
 Diller paid a visit to CBS News headquarters on Thursday to speak of the news 
division's importance to the company, and Stringer said Friday that Diller "is 
very interested in news-gathering." But several employees remain nervous. And, 
said one TV executive who has worked with Diller on news, "I think people at 
CBS News have every right to feel nervous and suspicious about the impact of 
the merger.  
</P>
<P>
 "Barry has always been an enigmatic figure in news," continued the executive, 
"although I think the news philosophy at Fox has been more reflective of 
(owner) Rupert Murdoch than Barry. I think Barry's focus is going to be on CBS 
as an entertainment company in broadcasting and cable. He'll be careful not to 
tamper with CBS News right away. But, if it gets in the way of his vision for 
CBS, I think he'll swat it like a fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Producers in the Hollywood entertainment community said that they welcome the 
arrival of Diller. "I don't think (the planned merger) will have a tremendous 
impact on people who already have long-term relationships with CBS," said 
producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. "But, judging from his reputation, I would 
imagine that Diller would bring a great deal of talent and energy to anything 
he tackles." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be a marriage made in heaven," said producer Fred Silverman, 
who has a new series, "Diagnosis: Murder," on the CBS fall schedule. "No 
broadcasting company today can live in a vacuum. Barry has been working in 
non-traditional areas like home shopping, and he has the expertise in 
broadcasting. I think this merger will lead CBS into the 21st Century."

THE BODY POLITICS; THEATER: L.A.'S RON ATHEY, WHOSE PERFORMANCE ART INCLUDES 
PIERCING AND OTHER BODY MODIFICATIONS, IS AT THE CENTER OF THE LATEST NEA 
FUNDING FLAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Performance artist Ron Athey, who provoked the latest objections by two U.S. 
senators to granting practices by the National Endowment for the Arts, speaks 
in dulcet tones and never forgets to say thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, sometimes he almost sounds like the Church Lady. But that's not 
surprising coming from someone whose evangelical aunts reared him to be a child 
preacher. 
</P>
<P>
 What might be more shocking is the contrast between Athey's nearly prim 
manners and his controversial performance art. 
</P>
<P>
 Tattooed and pierced all over his well-muscled body, Athey's work engages in 
onstage rites of body modification -- including piercing, branding, 
bloodletting and cutting. His performances also use S&M, fetishistic and 
gender-bending imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Athey has some ardent followers, even the sympathetic have been known 
to become weak of stomach when faced with some of his onstage endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his current notoriety, he is part of a large movement, the Modern 
Primitives, that has been a prominent subculture in Los Angeles and elsewhere 
for the past three or four years. The movement inspired Reza Abdoh's theatrical 
performance "Bogeyman," seen in 1991 at Los Angeles Theatre Center, and has 
since influenced mainstream pop culture as well -- from the women and men in 
Madonna's "Sex" book and the singer's own studded nostril to fashion models' 
navel rings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Never has such work been as visible as it is now, since two senators drew 
national attention to the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by newspaper reports about Athey's March 5 performance of "Four 
Scenes in a Harsh Life" at Walker Art Center in Minneapolis (the work was also 
seen at Highways last fall), Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), chair of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee that recommended the cut, and Sen. Don Nickles 
(R-Okla.) wrote a June 17 letter to NEA Chair Jane Alexander. They complained 
about a scene in which Athey performs a ritual cutting on a fellow performer, 
makes prints of the cuts' bleeding pattern and hangs the papers on a 
clothesline. 
</P>
<P>
 The senators' objections came just before Congress began considering the 
current $170.2-million annual appropriation for the NEA; last week, a 
subcommittee vote in the House recommended a 2% cut in the NEA budget, and a 
similar vote in the Senate subcommittee recommended a 5% cut. The bill is 
expected to reach the floor of the Senate sometime after the July 4 recess. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker officials say that Athey received only $150 in NEA funds for the 
performance, a small portion of a larger grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The senators warned Alexander that NEA funding could be "in serious jeopardy" 
because Athey put "audience members . . . at risk" by exposing them to 
HIV-positive blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did meet with Jane Alexander and I encouraged her to try and avoid these 
more notorious grants, those that really are offensive, and Mr. Athey's is 
one," says Nickles. "It may be Mr. Athey's right to do these so-called 
performances, but it's not our obligation to subsidize it." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Athey and Walker officials have denied the senators' charges that the 
artist put any audience members at risk. The man whose blood was used to make 
the prints is HIV-negative. And Athey says no audience members were in danger 
of coming into contact with any blood, HIV-positive or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The senators' information came from a Washington Post story based on an 
inaccurate article distributed by a wire service. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both Athey and the Walker refuted the report, the misinformation has 
remained in the public realm. "The inaccuracies have been in hundreds of 
papers," says Athey, who works at L.A. Weekly as an editorial assistant, 
speaking by phone from New York, where he has been performing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate's proposed cuts are program-specific rather than across-the-board, 
as were the recommendations in the House version of the bill. In presenting the 
committee version of the bill, Byrd, who declined comment for this article, 
pointedly noted that all of the proposed 5% cut "is directed at those grant 
programs which have been at the center of recent controversies." 
</P>
<P>
 Athey was raised in Pomona and is a former punk-scene member who once wanted 
to be a scientist. He began writing and getting tribal-style tattoos around 
1981, but it wasn't until 1991 that he began to explore his current mode of 
performance. Since then, he's appeared at a variety of clubs and 
alternative-art spaces, along with the prestigious Walker Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Athey's recent notoriety apparently hasn't jeopardized his growing popularity. 
Next month, he is scheduled to perform in London and Vienna, and a SoHo gallery 
will open a show about his work. Within a month, a film of Athey's 
controversial performance piece will be released by New Queer Cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Athey, who can seem almost willfully naive about the vicissitudes of 
politics, still appears dismayed at the tempest and the ways in which his work 
has been used as a political symbol by conservative politicians. "I'm not 
overtly political. I'm more emotional," he says. "Politics just gets dragged 
into it because of my working with the body." 
</P>
<P>
 The politics have indeed eclipsed any discussion of the work's content -- 
which includes symbolic and allegorical responses to his ultra-Fundamentalist 
upbringing. His works rely heavily on references to martyr symbols and 
archetypes as well as stigmata. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist says part of "Four Scenes in a Harsh Life" is about "redemption 
from self-destruction and suicide." Other sections of the partly 
autobiographical piece focus on "juxtaposing traditional ceremony against 
tribal rituals and fetishes. Only because of the age we live in is the 
subcontext AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 Athey believes the political focus on his work is just part of a larger issue. 
"When people don't understand something, there's fear involved," he says. 
"Actually, a lot of people with tattoos and piercing are very nice people. 
That's just their kink."

 Who imagined during the near-hysterical adoration surrounding his "Born in the 
U.S.A." success a decade ago that Bruce Springsteen would ever be in need of a 
comeback record? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the relatively cool public response to his two 1992 albums and a post-E 
Street Band tour left Springsteen -- the man whose name for years was 
synonymous with integrity and quality in rock 'n' roll -- with much to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 His most strident detractors dismissed him as no longer relevant.

<P>
 Springsteen proved them wrong late last year with "Streets of Philadelphia," a 
moving ballad about a man whose body is being destroyed by AIDS. It was written 
for and featured in Jonathan Demme's film "Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 On a commercial level, "Streets," which was released as a single in February, 
became Springsteen's first Top 10 hit since "Tunnel of Love" in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, "Streets" won an Academy Award for best song and stands as 
the most absorbing single of the first half of 1994. It's a work that shows 
Springsteen, despite all the questions raised by changes in his life in recent 
years, can still write purposeful songs that connect on a deeply emotional 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample lyrics: 
</P>
<P>
 I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone  
</P>
<P>
 I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone  
</P>
<P>
 At night I could hear the blood in my veins  
</P>
<P>
 Black and whispering in the rain  
</P>
<P>
 On the streets of Philadelphia.  
</P>
<P>
 While nothing else on today's 10-best list approached the somber eloquence of 
"Streets," the other records reflected a healthy diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 The singles range from the wry adolescent sensibilities of Beck's "Loser" to 
the smoldering soul intimacy of Me'Shell NdegeOcello's "If That's Your 
Boyfriend (He Wasn't Last Night)." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the records on the list were released in late 1993 or come from 1993 
albums, but they all either entered the pop charts or reached their highest 
chart positions during the past six months. The list of mid-year best albums 
will appear in Sunday's Calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 My 10 best singles so far in 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Bruce Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia" (Columbia). "I was bruised 
and battered / I couldn't tell what I felt / I was unrecognizable to myself," 
Springsteen sings in a voice that expresses the helplessness and heartache of 
someone dying of AIDS as convincingly as Springsteen once conveyed the dreams 
and aspirations of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more uncompromising than the film itself, "Streets of Philadelphia" pays 
tribute to those with AIDS by refusing to minimize the suffering. There's no 
false sense of celebration or optimism to make the topic or the record more 
palatable. This is a record that plays for keeps. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Beck's "Loser" (DGC). If "Streets of Philadelphia" gains its strength from 
the clarity of its message, the lure here is the teasing way Beck uses 
inarticulateness as a weapon to deliver much the same message Dylan did so 
often in the '60s: Question authority. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it's only natural that Beck has been embraced in the media as a Dylanesque 
spokesman for the slacker generation. And, like Dylan, Beck is wary of the tag. 
In Spin magazine, he good-naturedly downplays the single's sociological 
significance. "It's not some anguished, transcendental cry of a generation," he 
says. "It's just like sitting in someone's living room eating pizza and 
Doritos." 
</P>
<P>
 3. Me'Shell NdegeOcello's "If That's Your Boyfriend (He Wasn't Last Night)" 
(Maverick/Sire). A tale of infidelity that is classic both for its sensual beat 
and for the way NdegeOcello puts down everybody involved in the triangle. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The Cranberries' "Dream" (Island). Irresistible pop-rock romanticism, all 
the sweeter for the echoes of sweeping Phil Spector sonic design. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Gin and Juice" (Death Row/Interscope). The language in 
this party-time rap interlude is dopey, but the music itself is as silky and 
soulful as the great Memphis hits from the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Uncanny Alliance's "I'm Beautiful Dammitt!" (A&M). Who said you can't have 
great dance music and content? A marvelous exercise in self-affirmation by a 
promising New York duo. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Pavement's "Cut Your Hair" (Matador). A light-hearted alternative rock 
warning against trying to fit in with what is fashionable. 
</P>
<P>
 8. M People's "Moving On Up" (Epic). Another glorious dance floor record -- as 
spirited a declaration of independence (from a bad relationship) as Gloria 
Gaynor's "I Will Survive." 
</P>
<P>
 9. Crash Test Dummies' "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" (Arista). The exaggerated vocal 
narration makes this sound like a novelty, but it is a deceptively original 
work about how kids are often tormented for falling outside the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 10. All-4-One's "So Much in Love" (Blitzz/Atlantic). This debut single by the 
Los Angeles R&B vocal quartet is pure poetry in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Midyear 10 
</P>
<P>
 Colleague Dennis Hunt nominates All-4-One's "So Much in Love" as the best 
single of the last six months. The rest of his Top 10, in order: Masta Ace 
Incorporated's "Born to Roll," Me'Shell NdegeOcello's "If That's Your Boyfriend 
(He Wasn't Last Night)," M People's "Moving On Up," Snoopy Doggy Dog's "Gin and 
Juice," Us3's "Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)," Beck's "Loser," General Public's 
"I'll Take You There," Wynonna Judd's "Rock Bottom" and Crash Test Dummies' 
"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm."

 The California Arts Council has given the Santa Ana-based St. Joseph Ballet 
its top ranking of 4, up from 3-plus last year.The company, which gives dance 
instruction to low-income inner-city children, is seeking $25,245 in state arts 
money. Last year it received $3,426. The state council also awarded Ballet 
Pacifica a 2-plus rating in the Laguna Beach-based company's first CAC grant 
application. The company requested $20,000. The council uses the rankings to 
determine amounts of organizational grants, which will be decided on Sept. 8. 
Groups ranked below 3-minus usually do not receive CAC money.

'LION KING' TOO VIOLENT FOR LITTLE VIEWERS?; MOVIES: DISNEY'S OPUS HAS 
VIOLENCE, TREACHERY AND A PROLONGED SCENE OF A PARENT'S DEATH. BE PREPARED TO 
FACE THE WAILS OF YOUR CHILDREN, SOME REVIEWERS SAY. BOSH, SAY PSYCHOLOGISTS.

 "The Lion King's" animation dazzles. It has the golden G rating. But most 
important for parents seeking wholesome entertainment, "The Lion King" carries 
the ultimate blessing: the Disney name. 
</P>
<P>
 So why would parents hesitate? 
</P>
<P>
 Amid even glowing reviews for "The Lion King," some critics are offering stern 
warnings, such as this one from the Prodigy on-line service: 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney's increasingly weird predilection for cartoon violence, and for 
killing off at least one parent, is lamentably overdone this time," wrote 
Prodigy's own on-line reviewer, William C. Banks. On a 1 to 5 scale for 
violence, Banks gave it a 3. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the tenor of the critical cautions: "The Lion King" has violence. 
Treachery. Slavering, wild-eyed hyenas. A prolonged scene of a parent's death 
that leaves the heart-wrenching aspects of "Bambi" in the dust. Think twice, 
some reviewers say, or face the anguished wails of your little ones as you 
leave the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie took in $42 million in its first wide-release weekend, so it's clear 
that a lot of parents aren't taking the critics' warnings to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 But should they? Surely real life is bad enough without putting dead parents, 
scary scavengers and claw-wielding battles into an animated movie for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a few psychologists say that's not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Uses of Enchantment," his classic book on the importance of fairy 
tales, child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim contends that such stories allow 
children to give shape to their inner conflicts and find ways to resolve them. 
He believed that those who purged children's tales of danger, darkness and 
monsters missed something. 
</P>
<P>
 "They missed the monster a child knows best and is most concerned with: the 
monster he feels or fears himself to be. . . . Without such fantasies, the 
child fails to get to know his monster better, nor is he given suggestions as 
to how he may gain mastery over it." 
</P>
<P>
 The anxiety about scenes of violence and death often lies with the parents, 
not the children, said Dee Shepherd-Look, a child psychologist who practices in 
Woodland Hills and is a professor of psychology at California State University, 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "A parent feels that if something is tragic or terrible: 'I should shield my 
child.' But research has shown it's not in children's best interest," she said. 
"Children do experience feelings of sadness and apprehension. Parents need to 
let them have those experiences, and be there to help them and guide them." 
</P>
<P>
 The violent scenes and the father's death in "The Lion King" didn't bother 
Rosalyn Laudati, a psychologist who practices in Newport Beach and Brea. The 
violence wasn't blatant or gory, she said. And the film could help a child cope 
with a loss short of a parent's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids nowadays experience the loss of a dad, not just through death, but 
through divorce," she said. "This showed a boy surviving," even after his 
father was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recent matinee at Pacific's Lakewood Center Theater, most of the 
children and parents interviewed said they liked "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 Clutching a stuffed-animal version of the hero, Simba, 4-year-old Clarissa 
Murray of Long Beach smiled serenely and shook her head when asked if she was 
scared or upset by the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Her favorite part? Not the funny wart hog or the tender love story. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hyenas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father and mother, Kevin and Cynthia Murray, said they had been concerned 
when they saw television stories reporting "The Lion King's" allegedly 
frightening aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than skip the movie, they prepared for it. They bought Clarissa a 
book and cassette version, and discussed the death of Simba's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Murray said they didn't want a repeat of "Beethoven's 2nd," where 
Clarissa watched in horror as a puppy was dangled over a waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "That scared her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Simba found his father lying in the dust after a wildebeest stampede, 
Joel, 4, and Jonathan Polk Jr., 9, of Compton, were not hysterical or sad, 
their father said. Just perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids asked us, 'Is he dead?' " Jonathan Polk said. He and his wife, 
Cynthia, told them the father was indeed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when Simba sees a vision of his father urging him to return to the 
pride, the boys were really confused. Was Simba's father still dead or had he 
somehow returned to life? 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'He's dead-dead,' " Polk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old Tiffany Robinson of Long Beach cried her way through the 
movie, said her mother, Patty Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was really neat, but sad, too," Tiffany said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the movie wasn't a hit with Lauren Bartlett, 4, of Lakewood. She spent 
most of it curled in her mother's lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too violent for her," said her mother, Cheryl Bartlett. "She was 
hanging on to me real tight." 
</P>
<P>
 She and Patty Robinson agreed that the movie probably was too intense for 
children under 5. "It was tastefully violent, though. Not graphic, and there 
was no suffering," Robinson said. "You see worse on television."

THEY CAN'T HELP FALLING; ELVIS DIVING TEAM INVADES KNOTT'S, SIDEBURNS AND ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten Elvis impersonators -- known to the movie-going public as The Flying Elvi 
-- descended from the sky Friday in white jumpsuits, red scarves and sideburns, 
in a parachute performance before an appreciative crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Elvi landed on Dianna Berrena, 49, of Whittier, whose posterior was 
slightly bruised but whose love for Elvis remained unabated. "It was worth it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berrena was among several thousand Elvis fans who crowded in and around Calico 
Square at Knott's Berry Farm to watch a performance by The Flying Elvi, the 
group that gained attention in the movie "Honeymoon in Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 Jumping from a plane at 12,500 feet and braving gusty 15-knot winds, two of 
the Elvi landed feet first on a large white target; two landed in a reflecting 
pool and had to do a quick costume change; and the rest managed to land safely 
elsewhere in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, except for Roger Foster of Las Vegas, who accidentally landed on 
Berrena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried pulling her out of the way, but he was just too quick," said 
Berrena's husband, Dennis. "He (Foster) tried real hard to make it a miss, but 
he just couldn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really jealous when he hit that lady," said Yolanda McPeck, 25, of 
Anaheim, noting she is looking for an Elvis impersonator to marry. "I wanted it 
to be me." 
</P>
<P>
 The small crowded square was one of the tightest drops the team has tried to 
land in since banding together in 1992, when "Honeymoon in Vegas" was made, 
Elvi members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a scale of one to 10, this was an 11," team captain Mark Gilespie said. 
"This is our job, but it does make it thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilespie, who was born and raised in Memphis -- home of Elvis Presley -- said 
that he has always been partial to the King's music. He added, however, that 
none of the team members feels quite the adoration of a true Elvis worshiper. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, The Flying Elvi act has taken on a "life of its own," Gilespie said, 
noting that the group has performed about 40 times since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which originally called themselves Into the Fire sky divers, was 
performing group formation jumps in and around Las Vegas when the filmmakers of 
"Honeymoon in Vegas" started looking around for a team that could make a 
parachute jump in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Honeymoon," groups started calling to see if The Flying Elvi were a 
real act, said Joe Speck, the team's executive vice president who started 
managing the group after the movie was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Team members do not actually spend their time outside the act in bell-bottomed 
jumpsuits studded with sequins and wigs with sideburns. Gilespie, for instance, 
is a health inspector for Clark County, Nev. Other members include airline 
pilots, a schoolteacher, an owner of Jiffy Lube franchises, and a carpet 
salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are sky divers, they are not singers," Speck said, adding that each team 
member is in great physical shape. "It's a very precise, choreographed show." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's performance Friday kicked off a summer-long tribute to Elvis 
Presley at Knott's Berry Farm. Called "Elvis Rockin' U.S.A.," the tribute will 
run through Labor Day.

MAN GETS REHEARING IN '81 SLAYINGS IN GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man sentenced to death for a double murder in Orange County has been granted 
a new hearing by a federal appeals court on his contention that his trial 
lawyer was incompetent and preoccupied with his own campaign for Congress.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2 to 1 that Jaturun Siripongs was 
entitled to a hearing before a federal judge because his lawyer failed to 
investigate the possibility that an accomplice had committed the murders and 
presented no evidence about Siripongs' background. 
</P>
<P>
 James Spellman, Siripongs' lawyer and an Orange County deputy public defender, 
had never handled a capital case and "was running for Congress during most of 
the time that he should have been preparing the case for trial," the court 
said. It also said available testimony from relatives and others "would 
undoubtedly have improved Siripongs' chances of receiving a life sentence" 
instead of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Siripongs, 42, of Hawthorne, a former Buddhist monk from Thailand, was 
convicted of strangling a Garden Grove food store manager and fatally stabbing 
a clerk during a 1981 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the manager, Packovan (Pat) Wattanaporn, 36, was robbed of jewelry 
worth $25,000, most of which was later traced to Siripongs. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court upheld his death sentence unanimously in 1988 and 
denied a hearing on his separate claim of incompetent counsel. U.S. District 
Judge William Keller also dismissed that claim without a hearing, ruling that 
Spellman's actions were legitimate tactical choices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the appeals court ordered Keller to hold a hearing into the rationale and 
impact of Spellman's decision to present no evidence at the guilt phase and 
little evidence at the penalty phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Spellman did not seriously examine evidence, suggesting that others were 
involved in the crime, said Judge Mary Schroeder in the majority opinion. She 
said Spellman never tested hair and blood samples and shoe prints that did not 
belong to Siripongs or the victims, or checked out reports that an unidentified 
man had made threatening phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Spellman did not explain those omissions in out-of-court questioning reviewed 
by Keller, and "admits he was distracted by campaigning for federal office," 
Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Spellman won the Democratic primary for the 42nd Congressional 
District seat but lost in the general election to Republican Daniel E. Lungren. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Keller found that the failure to investigate a possible accomplice was a 
tactical decision, because it would have required admitting that Siripongs was 
at the scene. But Schroeder said there was no evidence that it was either a 
tactical decision or an informed one. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the jury, in considering Siripongs' punishment, could have been 
affected by evidence about a possible accomplice, testimony from family and 
friends about Siripongs' background, or his lack of a violent criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 Spellman presented no such testimony. His only explanation, which Keller 
accepted, was that he feared going into Siripongs' record because it might 
allow evidence of his involvement in a burglary in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schroeder said the trial judge tentatively barred evidence of the 
burglary. She said Spellman made "no attempt to humanize (Siripongs) before the

 Judge Ferdinand Fernandez dissented. He said the accomplice defense was 
implausible, the available testimony from family members was "utterly 
unmoving," and there were legitimate tactical reasons for the defense lawyer's 
conduct.

MISSION VIEJO KILLINGS JOLT CONDO RESIDENTS; SHOOTINGS: NEIGHBORS OF THE 
MURDER-SUICIDE VICTIMS SAY THERE NEVER WAS A HINT OF TROUBLE BETWEEN THE TWO. 
</P>

<P>
 To residents of the Baja Finisterra condominium complex, Janice Beliavski and 
Joseph Leroy Black were a couple who seemed to have very little in common. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a straight-forward, highly-motivated career woman and single mother 
who still found time to sit on the board of her homeowners association. He was 
a low-key, unassuming man who never seemed to have a job, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, their 10-year relationship seemed solid, and they continued to spend 
time together even after the 45-year-old Black moved out of his 46-year-old 
girlfriend's condominium, which overlooks the golf course of the Mission Viejo 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday night, their lives came to a sudden and violent end when, 
authorities said, an intoxicated Black, armed with a knife and a gun, forced 
his way into the condominium and attempted to sexually assault and shoot 
Beliavski's teen-age daughter, before turning the gun on Beliavski, who died 
trying to protect her daughter. Black then committed suicide with the pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known them for years, and I never would have expected anything like this 
to happen," said neighbor John Cowart. "It's a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy began unfolding at about 6 p.m., when Black arrived at the 
condominium in the 26000 block of Poveda. Beliavski was out shopping at the 
time and her 15-year-old daughter was home alone, said Orange County Sheriff's 
Department spokesman Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made sexual advances towards the daughter and she retreated to the 
bathroom," Martini said. "Once she was inside, the suspect fired four rounds at 
the bathroom door." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Beliavski arrived home and began struggling with Black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard blood-curdling screams, then I heard (Beliavski) saying, 'I'm sorry! 
I'm sorry! Please don't!' " recalled downstairs neighbor Candy Fergeson, who 
called police after hearing the gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran outside and yelled up to the window, 'Leave her alone! Don't touch 
her!' " Fergeson said Friday. "I yelled that I had called the cops. Then I 
heard: Bam. Bam. Bam. Three more shots. I called 9-1-1 again and I said, 'He's 
killed her.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the shooting, Beliavski's daughter ran from the bathroom and managed to 
escape by jumping through the screen of her second-story bedroom window, 
landing on the ground 12 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's a very tragic situation. But it was very fortunate that this 
young lady handled it the way she did," Martini said. "Her will to survive and 
quick actions prevented a further tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter was met by a neighbor who took her to safety. She was taken to 
Mission Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo where she was treated for a 
severely sprained leg, cuts and bruises. She is now being cared for by 
relatives, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after shooting Beliavski, Black turned the handgun on himself and 
committed suicide. When SWAT team members broke down the front door of the 
condominium, they found the bodies of the couple near the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the grisly discovery was made, authorities feared they might have a 
hostage situation, so they evacuated a number of neighbors in the 118-unit 
complex and also cleared the adjacent golf course, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings perplexed both neighbors and police. There apparently was no 
history of domestic violence between the two and Black was not known as much of 
a drinker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I ever saw him with even a beer in his hand," Fergeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fergeson said Black had moved out of the condominium about two years ago 
because he had gained custody of several of his young children. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Beliavski) said that they couldn't live with her," the neighbor said. "He 
got an apartment in Irvine. But he would still come over all the time and they 
would do things together." 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about Black's background. He had worked in real estate loans 
in the past but hadn't any type of job for at least a few years, the neighbors 
said. He had served on one of the association's committees for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was involved," Cowart said. "This seems so out of character from anything 
I've ever known about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Beliavski worked as a free-lance court reporter and had been successful enough 
to purchase the condominium and other properties, Fergeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a real go-getter and always seemed to be in a hurry," Fergeson said. 
"Joe owned nothing and had nothing. For a single woman, she did quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Fergeson saw Beliavski, she said, the woman was digging in a box 
in her garage for a 50-year-old wedding invitation that she was going to use to 
surprise a friend or relative on an upcoming anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowart, who served with the victim on the association's board of directors, 
said that on the morning of her death, Beliavski had called him to confirm a 
fact for the association's newsletter which she had just completed that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very dedicated and very thorough," he said. "She worked all the time 
and didn't have a lot of time for socializing. I always thought she was a very 
nice lady who seemed to make the most of her time."

GRAND JURY REJECTS RECORDER HARASSMENT CASE; INVESTIGATION: LEE A. BRANCH SAYS 
FINDING VINDICATES HIM. BUT THE PANEL EXPRESSES CONCERN ABOUT HIS MANAGEMENT 
AND URGES OUTSIDE AUDIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury closed its investigation of county Recorder Lee 
A. Branch Friday, saying it could not corroborate allegations that Branch 
engaged in sexual harassment against employees, an official close to the 
investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury, however, expressed concern about allegations of office 
mismanagement and has recommended that an outside auditor review Branch's 
operation, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 A report of the grand jury's findings has been forwarded to the Board of 
Supervisors, which earlier this year censured the recorder for misconduct based 
on the harassment allegations and office mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch said Friday that he had learned of the grand jury's decision through 
informal channels and said the panel's finding "proves the point that these 
charges were all orchestrated and politically motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had faith in them," Branch said, referring to the grand jury members 
who this week ended their yearlong term. "This office is moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 An official familiar with the grand jury's findings said the panel was careful 
not to comment on the veracity of the sexual harassment claims, but found that 
there was insufficient corroboration to take the matter any further. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury has the option of filing criminal charges or initiating removal 
proceedings against an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors referred the Branch case to the grand jury in January after 
issuing the unprecedented censure, asking the watchdog agency to determine 
whether the misconduct allegations warranted his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the grand jury probe, county officials in a separate investigation 
found that two female employees were harassed by Branch. Both alleged that the 
recorder made unwanted sexual overtures to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch has repeatedly denied the charges, claiming that the allegations and 
subsequent investigations were part of a plan by county officials to drive him 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury's final report comes as the 57-year-old Branch is preparing to 
face County Clerk Gary Granville in the November runoff for the newly combined 
office of county clerk/recorder.

U.S. SOCCER TEAM FIRST IN ITS FIELD TO SCORE WITH COMPUTER PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL and JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. soccer team, a mere infant when compared to some of the giants in the 
world's most popular sport, is using its technological prowess to gain an 
advantage over its opponents in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will use its new tool, a computer program stored in floppy disks, 
against the powerful Brazilian team when they meet in the second round on the 
Fourth of July in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 The program analyzes every movement of the ball on the field, and coaches will 
use it to plot a strategy against opposing teams, take advantage of an 
opponent's weaknesses and defend against its offensive strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, it's a revolutionary form of analysis," said Steve Sampson, 
the assistant coach of the U.S. team. "To my knowledge, it's never been used in 
any sport." 
</P>
<P>
 The unique program, used in the impressive victory over Colombia, was created 
by two San Fernando Valley engineers and interpreted by Sampson, a former UCLA 
and University of Santa Clara soccer coach from Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Zvi Friedman, a systems analyst and lifelong soccer enthusiast, and Jon Kotas, 
a co-worker and computer expert, developed the program to be the world's most 
advanced soccer analysis system. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 18 months, Friedman and Kotas crafted a program that allows them 
to track the ball's every movement in a match. 
</P>
<P>
 With a pair of binoculars, a computer keyboard and mouse, and their patented 
computer code called Scribbler, Kotas and Friedman can sit in the stands or 
press box and input data which later will be printed out on a chart showing who 
passed the ball to whom, how often, which passes were completed, where on the 
field a player makes his passes or scoring attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 A coach such as Sampson can then study the information, print out a booklet 
that is distributed to the players, and then plan how a particular opponent 
tends to attack or defend. Combined with a videotape of the same match, the 
information comes alive, said Sampson at the Dana Point Resort, where the team 
is staying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players can look at the information on the bus, on the plane, at the training 
center," Sampson said. "You start to see patterns in the way a team plays, to 
see such things as who a player tends to give the ball to. If we can give our 
players any kind of competitive edge, that's all they really ask of us." 
</P>
<P>
 For players such as starting defender Paul Caligiuri, a native of Westminster 
now living in Diamond Bar, the new computer analysis is a major advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous addition to our operation, I think," Caligiuri said 
Thursday after practice at the Mission Viejo training center. "This is the 
first time I've used it and it's helped me a lot. . . . Basically, I tend to do 
certain things on the field, and if something I want didn't happen, I can see 
why." 
</P>
<P>
 Other national teams such as Germany have started using a computer, but 
nothing as sophisticated as the program designed by Kotas and Friedman, Sampson 
said. Many purists, such as Coach Bora Milutinovic of the U.S. team, remain 
reluctant to put too much credence in the technology, Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of traditionalists resent it," Sampson said. "Bora himself has been 
very difficult to warm up to this, but a lot of it is that he's not comfortable 
with the computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson predicts that the use of the computer will evolve similar to the use 
of the videotape. "Now it's practically impossible to prepare a team without 
videotape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer program offers more than preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be used to make quick adjustments during a game, witness the U.S. 
team's 2-1 victory over Colombia, a victory that some consider the greatest 
upset in World Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime of that match, Friedman, clutching a handful of charts taken from 
the first half, sprinted from the Rose Bowl press box through rows of fans to 
deliver some critical information to Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
 The charts showed that Colombia's Wilson Perez was attacking constantly on the 
right side of the field and not coming back to defend. The charts also showed 
that the U.S. was attacking almost entirely from the left side, the opposite 
side that Perez was leaving unguarded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Ernie Stewart scored to give the U.S. a 2-0 lead. The ball 
came down the right side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, the U.S. team tracked the tendencies of the Colombian attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew going into the game where they were likely to handle the ball," 
Caligiuri said. "We knew they didn't attack down the wings and that allowed us 
to concentrate on funneling them down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Sampson: "Their shots on goal mostly came from a central position, which 
is exactly what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The system's most important test will come Monday at Stanford Stadium when the 
U.S. team plays one of the favorites to take the cup, mighty Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson and Milutinovic have pored over the charts provided by the system, but 
Brazil plays a unique style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer has provided us some detailed information, but each game is 
different, especially when you play a team like Brazil," Milutinovic said 
Thursday at the training camp. "Brazil is a team that bases its game on 
improvisation, using players who are the best in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians also happen to be the other national team involved with Kotas 
and Friedman. After seeing a presentation of the program in January, Brazilian 
Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira bought the services of Kotas and Friedman (they 
provide the program free to the U.S. team). 
</P>
<P>
 By prior contractual arrangement, however, Kotas and Friedman will not provide 
Brazil any information on the U.S. during or prior to the match. If Brazil 
wins, Kotas and Friedman will again work with that team. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying stacks of notes on Brazil, Friedman has become a believer in 
the genius of their players. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody is going to win the World Cup, it should be Brazil with their 
great talent," he said. "But, maybe, hopefully, the U.S. can pull off the upset 
of the century. . . . We're going to the quarterfinals either way."

CHAMPAGNE PARTY IS FOCUS OF PROBE; GOVERNMENT: RECORDER'S OFFICE EMPLOYEES SAY 
THE ASSISTANT RECORDER SERVE ALCOHOL TO UNDERAGE WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Employees in the troubled Orange County recorder's office have accused Ella M. 
Murphy, the assistant recorder, of hosting holiday champagne parties inside the 
office and offering alcohol to underage workers. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are investigating the allegations, Murphy said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Murphy had little comment, beyond confirming that the matter was the subject 
of an inquiry by the county administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware that (county officials) are looking at this," Murphy said. "I don't 
want to jeopardize the investigation in any way by commenting about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, however, did say that the title companies who do business with the 
recorder's office provided various gifts for the office during the past 
Christmas holiday season, and she generally allowed acceptance of those gifts 
as long as the tokens were directed to the general office staff, rather than to 
administrators in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 The new gift ordinance prohibits top county employees from accepting gifts 
from those who do business with the county or are seeking government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 One employee in the recorder's office, who spoke on the condition that he not 
be identified, said he was recently interviewed by the district attorney's 
office about Murphy's activities and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations involving Murphy surfaced in wake of separate investigations 
of Recorder Lee A. Branch, who earlier this year was censured by the Board of 
Supervisors for misconduct in office related to harassment of employees and 
general office mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees said they expressed their concerns about Murphy to Branch earlier 
this year, but the recorder said this week that he was powerless to consider 
any disciplinary actions against her because of the restrictions placed on him 
resulting from the board's censure. 
</P>
<P>
 In their January rebuke of Branch, county officials recommended that the 
county administrative office, county counsel's office and the personnel 
director agree on all disciplinary actions against employees of the recorder's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told that it happened," Branch said this week of the New Year's Eve 
champagne party. "I was told that the champagne came from the title companies. 
I reported it to the CAO's office when the employees reported it to me. What 
else could I do? I am restricted from reprimanding anybody, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 County officials involved in the Murphy investigation were not available for 
comment Friday, but Mario Aguirre, a 24-year-old assistant in the recorder's 
office, said he was among those who took his concerns about Murphy and last 
year's party to officials in the CAO's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre said he was present during the celebration, which began shortly after 
the office closed its doors to the public on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 When the doors were secured, Aguirre said, Murphy brought out eight to 10 
bottles of champagne and began pouring drinks for office staffers and employees 
of local messenger services who spend much time in the recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre said workers told Murphy that about "five or 10" people present were 
not of legal drinking age, "but she just laughed it off." 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it might be a substantial violation of county policy given that 
she was serving minors alcohol," Aguirre said. "I felt she was being very 
lighthearted about the entire situation. She seemed to be very carefree about 
serving people who were underage." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, who has worked in the office for four years, and others said a 
champagne party has been an annual event. During that time, he and others said, 
the title companies have traditionally supplied the champagne and other 
refreshments to the office, which is a repository for documents involving real 
estate and banking transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't think this (the party) would happen given the problems that 
were going on in the office at the time," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Within the past few weeks some employees, who expressed their concerns about 
Murphy's behavior to higher county authorities, have come to Branch asking 
about the status of the county inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aware that any disciplinary action has been taken," Branch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who has served as the county's assistant recorder for the past 15 
years, had been openly critical of Branch's management of the office. 
</P>
<P>
 During the investigations of her boss, she declared herself a candidate for 
the office but last month failed to qualify for the November runoff which will 
pit Branch against County Clerk Gary Granville.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL TO FOCUS ON EMPLOYEES' SPIKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to take action Tuesday involving city employees 
who plan to "spike" their retirement pensions by adding such benefits as unused 
vacation days and car allowances. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's regular meeting will move from its usual Monday slot because of 
the Fourth of July holiday and be held Tuesday starting at 6:30 p.m. in the 
council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking occurs when employees inflate their final year's wages -- on which a 
pension is based -- by foregoing vacation days, car allowances and other 
benefits and taking them as wages instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The city estimates that pension spiking by city employees could cost $13 
million in additional pension benefits and, because those pensions are 
unfunded, it could become a liability for the city. Officials say the state 
will bill the city for some of that cost.  
</P>
<P>
 The council at its June 20 meeting enacted a two-week moratorium on paying the 
spiked portions of any retirements pending legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan, chairman of a City Council subcommittee that is 
investigating spiking, said the council is expected to meet in closed session 
before Tuesday's meeting with attorney Peter J. Brown of the Los Angeles firm 
of Liebert, Cassidy & Frierson to discuss the council's options. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said the council is expected to announce its decision during the open 
portion of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sullivan said that Brown, who specializes in employee relations, 
sent a letter this week on behalf of the city to the state Public Employees 
Retirement System (PERS) informing officials that Huntington Beach will not pay 
a $743,632 bill for spiked pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The letter says that we feel that the spiking process is illegal, therefore, 
an illegal act can't be approved and we are not going to pay for the spiking," 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action slated for Tuesday's meeting, the council is expected to 
consider an ordinance that would set development standards for single-family 
residential projects built on parcels of land either adjacent or surrounded by 
existing homes. The intent of the standards are to ensure compatibility of new 
homes with existing homes in a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on June 6 adopted a 45-day building moratorium on these types of 
parcels, dubbed "in-fill lots," pending an ordinance to address compatibility 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 More information about the meeting is available by calling the city clerk's 
office at (714) 536-5227. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CITY REQUESTS AID FOR IMMIGRANT COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have asked the federal government to share some of the 
cost of providing services to refugees and newly arrived immigrants, and to 
stem the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The council this week passed two resolutions on immigration, including one 
that described public services provided to immigrants, both legal and illegal, 
as an "unfunded mandate" by the federal government on state and local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 In becoming the first Orange County city to join in the immigration debate, 
council members said that the cost of providing public health, education, 
welfare, social services and criminal justice to immigrants is growing "at an 
alarming rate." 
</P>
<P>
 However, city officials said they do not know how much the city is spending on 
immigrant services. Gov. Pete Wilson has asked the federal government for $3.1 
billion in reimbursements for statewide services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is home to the largest Vietnamese American community in the country. 
About 20% of the city's 81,000 population is Asian American and about 18% is 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a race issue, it's a financial issue," acting City Manager Robert J. 
Huntley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders of local minority groups said that the council action is part of 
what they believe is a growing pattern of blaming all immigrants for 
California's continuing economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immigrants should not be used as scapegoats," said Dr. Co D.L. Pham, 
president of the Westminster Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. "I don't think 
it's fair. Immigrants have contributed to the growth of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that the Little Saigon business district pours about $1.5 
million in sales and property taxes to the city each year -- an amount city 
officials confirmed. A majority of the business owners there are not yet U.S. 
citizens, Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give much more than we receive from the city," Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, head of Los Amigos of Orange County, an Anaheim-based group that 
addresses Latino issues, said that the council members are misguided in their 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where will it stop?" David asked. "Will (services) to children born as U.S. 
citizens now be billed to the U.S. government just because they were fathered 
by immigrants?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Charles V. Smith, who was co-chairman of a task force on immigration at 
the recent U.S. Conference of Mayors, has advocated for the passage of the 
council resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that cities benefit from their immigrant population, but the costs of 
providing services to newly arrived immigrants are increasing at a time when 
revenues are declining. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tony Lam, who emigrated from Vietnam in the 1970s, said he was 
concerned the resolutions may be interpreted as "immigrant bashing," but voted 
for them anyway because he said he was worried about the cost of illegal 
immigration. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; COUNCIL APPROVES $1.6-MILLION BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, in a 4-1 vote, has approved a $1.6-million budget for the 
new fiscal year that started Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joseph S. Barsa said he voted against the overall budget because 
one part of it authorized spending up to $200,000 from city reserves for 
widening a section of Cerro Villa Drive, east of Loma Street. The Cerro Villa 
widening is the only item in the city budget that called for deficit spending. 
Barsa indicated he had no problem with the rest of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 During a workshop on the proposed budget June 14, the council majority said 
the Cerro Villa widening could be delayed if city finances take a downward 
turn. Barsa, however, said he did not think the item should be authorized, even 
provisionally. Barsa said he strictly opposes deficit spending. 
</P>
<P>
 He renewed that opposition Tuesday when the council formally voted on the 
overall budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has about $1.5 million in reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Like virtually all other cities in the state, Villa Park has suffered 
declining income in the past three years. Villa Park's total revenue in 1991-92 
was more than $2 million. It dropped to $1.95 million in 1992-93 and to about 
$1.7 million in 1993-94. The new budget predicts income will drop to just over 
$1.6 million in this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature has not yet approved a state budget, and some city officials 
have expressed fear that legislators will divert more money from cities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Villa Park City Manager Fred Maley said he has not heard of any state 
proposal so far that may cause the city's new budget to become unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
 At the City Council's June 14 budget workshop, Mayor Barry L. Denes predicted 
that Villa Park and all other cities in the state will be fiscally plundered by 
the Legislature in early 1995. "I believe that in January, every city in 
California is going to be nailed (by the Legislature)," Denes said.BILL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; SCHOOLS' BUDGET GIVES EMPLOYEES A 2% RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fullerton School District this week adopted a $46.4-million budget that 
gives all district employees a 2% raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The raise is the first in three years for the district's principals, whose 
salaries have been the lowest among principals in the county for years, board 
President Robert C. Fisler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the principals' salaries will match the county median -- about $55,000, 
Fisler said. He said he was satisfied with the board's move but disappointed 
that his colleagues did not support his proposal to also give principals 
gradual pay raises throughout their careers with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisler's idea was to give principals raises once they reach their fifth, 
eighth, 12th, 16th and 20th year in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, all principals -- those who just started and those who have been 
here 30 years -- are making the same amount of money," Fisler said. "I wish 
they could get higher salaries, because I feel principals are important in 
delivering the excellent education we want. . . . People forget sometimes that 
great programs don't occur in a vacuum. You have to have great leadership and 
great teachers." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; LOCAL DOGS HAVE DAY IN STATE GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anno has a nose to sniff out dope -- and his good work earned him the title of 
a top dog during recent competition at the California Police Summer Games.  
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old brown Belgian Malinois with a graying muzzle brought home two 
gold medals and a bronze medal during the narcotic detection competition last 
week at the games in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just does his job," said Fountain Valley Police Senior Officer Ray (Rocky) 
Rakitis. Rakitis, 39, and Anno have been partners for about five years, and 
competed in the games last year. But they didn't win a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning this year, Rakitis, a 12-year veteran with the department, said 
he was so excited that he rubbed Anno's head the entire drive home on 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the greatest days of my life," Rakitis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Igor, a 7 1/2-year-old Malinois who works patrol with Officer Paul Ellis of 
the Costa Mesa Police Department, also won honors. The 63-pound Igor won fourth 
place overall in the narcotics detection category in which 21 police dogs vied 
for awards.  
</P>
<P>
 Igor also placed sixth overall in a field of 51 police dogs who competed in 
other events in the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, 34, and a 10-year police veteran, said he was pleased with Igor's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are getting there," he said. "I think in another year we can do 
better. Then, we will have time to get highly polished." 
</P>
<P>
 Rakitis said Anno is a cross-trained police dog that not only finds drugs, but 
does patrol work as well, such as aiding in the apprehension of suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Rakitis said he was especially proud of his partner since many of the other 
contenders perform only narcotic searches on the job. Anno landed a first place 
in the luggage search competition, third place in the building search category, 
but fell to sixth place in the vehicle search. Rakitis said it was his fault 
the dog failed to find the drugs in the car door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bypassed the door -- and that's where I messed up," he said. "He still did 
all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Anno, however, was named best overall dog in the narcotics detection category, 
which earned him his second gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis and Igor, who have been a team for about a year, spent weeks training 
for the competition, which calls on dogs to jump through windows, hop over 
fences and crawl through a tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, however, said it takes about two years to train police dogs for peak 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rakitis said while the competition was rewarding, Anno's work on the streets 
is what counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Anno, one of the department's two police dogs, has earned respect. Among his 
finds were 40 kilos of cocaine stashed in the trunk of a car in a junkyard. He 
found the drugs in 40 minutes. Using police officers, it would have taken at 
least 12 hours, Rakitis said. The dog has also captured robbery and murder 
suspects and one time found $60,000 in drug proceeds under a house. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has also been hurt in the line of duty. He's been kicked in the face by 
a suspect, which wounded his left eye. And once he was thrown against a 
concrete wall by a heavyweight suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough life for a dog," Rakitis said. "We demand certain standards. A 
dog has to perform at a certain level. If not, he's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Anno has done an outstanding job, Rakitis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is truly my partner." DEBRA CANO and SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; 2 PLOTS STUDIED FOR POSSIBLE 'DOG PARK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted by Mayor Janet Godfrey, the city is looking at two small pieces of 
land as possible sites for a "dog park," where dogs can run without being on a 
leash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a real need for it," said Godfrey, who currently drives her 
180-pound mastiff to the dog park on Laguna Canyon Road in Laguna Beach."We 
have tons of homeowners associations that are concerned about dogs running 
loose and the waste left from dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 One site being considered is a patch of land in the Sulphur Creek area of 
Crown Valley Community Park just north of the YMCA building, City Manager Tim 
Casey said. He estimated that it would cost $10,000 to $20,000 to convert the 
14,000-square-foot piece of land into a dog park. 
</P>
<P>
 The second possible site is two-thirds of an acre next to Fire Station 49 on 
the Street of the Golden Lantern, Casey said. He said preparing that land for a 
dog park, including building a parking lot, would cost the city roughly 
$80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Godfrey believes building a dog park would also be good for dog owners, who 
would get an opportunity to share advice with other owners. She said she 
expects that animal aid organizations, pet stores and animal lovers will want 
to donate money for the development and upkeep of the park.LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CONTESTANTS WHIP UP ALCOHOL-FREE DRINKS

<P>
 It was the "battle of the blenders" Friday at the Newport Dunes Resort as 
eight enthusiastic bartenders tested out their most creative nonalcoholic 
drinks in preparation for the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 To bumping soul music, presentation category winners Ryan Gee and Ed Nankervis 
of the Roxbury South club tossed berries, ice cream and whipped cream into two 
blenders, over themselves, onto spectators and, finally, into 10 carefully 
stacked glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The "mocktail" competition was sponsored by COASTER, a new county coalition 
that is urging bars and restaurants to have a variety of nonalcoholic, yet 
tasty, drinks available for their customers over the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people feel uncomfortable in a group if they're not drinking 
alcohol," said California Highway Patrol Officer Angel Johnson, one of the 
judges at the lighthearted contest. "Being able to hold a fun drink relieves 
some of the pressure of people coming by and saying, 'Oh, a Coke? It won't hurt 
to just drink one (alcoholic drink).' " 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's event was the debut of COASTER, which stands for Coalition on Alcohol 
Services, Training and Educational Resources. COASTER, which is funded by a 
grant from the Orange County Health Care Agency, aims to reduce the county's 
alcohol-related incidents, such as drunk driving, by helping bars and 
restaurants be more responsible in how they serve alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is made up of county law enforcement agencies, public health 
organizations and hospitality industry representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to teach the hospitality industry that they don't have to do 
quarter pitchers of beer to draw in customers," COASTER publicist Frank Groff 
said. "There are alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting a stiff bay breeze Friday, bartender Mona Kort of the Disneyland 
Hotel blended guava juice, 7-Up and sweet-and-sour drink mix into a zingy, 
alcohol-free "Simba Summer Sipper." 
</P>
<P>
 Kort said the Disneyland Hotel serves lots of virgin drinks to the kiddies.  
</P>
<P>
 The hands-down favorites? The "Mickey" and "Minnie," code names for every 
child's drink delight -- the "Roy Rogers" and the "Shirley Temple." LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY BACKS MOVING HISTORIC BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to move structures on the historic Buffalo Ranch to the Orange County 
Fairgrounds received a boost this week when the City Council approved the 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-1 vote came as a disappointment to some local preservationists who had 
hoped the red barn buildings would remain at their current home on MacArthur 
Boulevard and that the site might be transformed into a park. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said the city lacks the money to preserve and restore the 
ranch, which was an amusement park in the 1950s and served as the headquarters 
for the architects who designed Irvine and UC Irvine in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know (the city) loses something of historical significance if (the 
buildings) are moved. But at least if they move to the fairgrounds, people can 
use them and see them," Mayor Michael Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council vote was meant only as an advisory measure because both the ranch 
buildings and the surrounding land are owned by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 For several months now, the Irvine Co. and Orange County Fair Board have been 
crafting a plan to relocate some of the 15 ranch buildings to the fairgrounds' 
Centennial Farms area, where they would be used as meeting halls and 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving and restoring the structures could cost more than $1 million. The 
Irvine Co. has expressed a willingness to pay for some of the expenses, and 
company officials are now negotiating with the fair on exactly how much they 
would contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if financing can be found, the relocation project would still require the 
completion of an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's council meeting, Irvine historian Judy Liebeck urged city and 
Irvine Co. officials to keep the buildings at the original ranch site. She said 
moving the structures would destroy any chance preservationists had for placing 
the ranch on the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebeck noted that the ranch was used by architect William Pereira to design 
UCI, portions of Irvine as well as Fashion Island in Newport Beach. Pereira, 
who once appeared on the cover of Time magazine, also designed the distinctive 
Transamerica pyramid building in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Greg Smith, who voted against the measure, wanted more information 
about whether the ranch could be preserved in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch land is zoned for residential development, and the Irvine Co. said 
it intends to one day build homes in the area.SHELBY GRAD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has appointed a business task force to help the county's 
oldest community grow economically. 
</P>
<P>
 After culling through many applications, the council chose 10 business leaders 
in the city to come up with plans to improve the city's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased to have so many qualified applicants to choose from," 
Councilwoman Carolyn Nash said. "Unfortunately, we couldn't select all of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-member committee will get busy preparing a report for the council that 
will include: 
</P>
<P>
 * New strategies to retain businesses and corporations in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 * Promotional programs that provide opportunities for the city and business 
community to become partners in promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beautification and other programs to enhance the downtown district and other 
areas of the city in order to stimulate shopping and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities are on the front line in dealing with this major issue of ensuring 
financial vitality," said Councilman Gil Jones, a small-business owner in the 
city. "We must find solutions that facilitate economic expansion of the city, 
yet address many related problems, such as preserving the quality of life and 
maintaining the village-like atmosphere of San Juan Capistrano." 
</P>
<P>
 Task force members appointed by the council are Sandra Bair of Eye Appeal 
Opticians; Joe Campbell of Ruby's Diner; Maria Cedeno of Mariners Bank; Sue 
DiMaio of Galleria Capistrano; Paul Farber, developer of the Franciscan Plaza; 
Rich Hanson, representing the San Juan Capistrano Chamber of Commerce; Gerry 
Miller of the Mission San Juan Capistrano; Al Parajeckas of Barwick Nissan;

MISSION VIEJO MAN KILLED IN NEW YORK

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old Mission Viejo man spending the summer in New York has been shot 
during an apparent robbery attempt, according to New York police. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Charles Blek, 21, a graduate of Trabuco Hills High School, was walking 
a girlfriend home early Wednesday in Queens when two robbers accosted them, New 
York police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blek, a student at Cal State Fresno, was shot in the chest and eye and died 
later. His companion was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Blek had just left for New York about a week ago and planned to 
spend the summer there. He had just landed a summer job in real estate and 
planned to return in the fall to Fresno State, where he was a mathematics 
major. 
</P>
<P>
 According to friends, his parents were in New York Friday making plans to 
bring their son's body to Orange County for burial. The funeral is scheduled 
for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said no one has been arrested in the case. But the same robbers are 
suspects in the fatal shooting of another man hours earlier in a Brooklyn 
neighborhood, police said.

NO CUTS PLANNED FOR SANTA ANA SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District Board of Education has approved its 
1994-95 budget, a $214-million spending plan that calls for no significant 
changes in staffing levels or programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting this week, the board unanimously approved the budget 
without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes a 1% pay increase for all employees and assumes no increased 
state funding to offset inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 District spokeswoman Diane Thomas said the plan avoids painful and 
controversial cuts in staff and programs that were necessary in past years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The continuing lack of increase from the state in education funding has put a 
strain on school districts across the state, but we're grateful that this year 
we don't need to make reductions to stay within our budget," she said. JON

<P>
 Four men suspected of forcing their way into a 26-year-old woman's apartment 
were being held Friday on suspicion of robbery and rape, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors saw four men with guns entering the woman's apartment in the 1100 
block of Mayfair Avenue about 3:45 p.m. Thursday and called police, Lt. Vince 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, the woman and her 6-year-old daughter were attempting 
to get out but one of the gunmen pulled them back into the apartment. A short 
time later, the woman and child were allowed to leave the apartment. The woman 
told police she had been raped. The child was not harmed, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers ordered the men out of the apartment and three of them complied. They 
were immediately taken into custody. A fourth man stayed inside for 40 minutes 
before surrendering without incident. Police recovered four guns at the scene, 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were: Antonio Julian Valdez, 19, and Ray Nel Ramos, 22, both of 
Anaheim, and Douglas Joel Audette and Juan Pablo Camacho both 18 and from Buena 
Park. All were being held at Anaheim city jail. GREG HERNANDEZ

PET OWNERS WARNED ABOUT HOLIDAY NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Animal shelter workers have some advice for pet owners over the holiday 
weekend -- don't leave your pet alone when fireworks are exploding. 
</P>
<P>
 Most pets, they say, are extremely frightened of such large noises, and are in 
danger of running away or being seriously injured trying to escape the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Animals don't understand holidays," said Eileen Pinder, manager of the Orange 
County Humane Society's animal shelter. "They think the world's coming to an 
end. Some of them even try to go through sliding glass doors because they're so 
afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinder said the lost dog and cat population at animal shelters rises 
significantly after holidays with loud celebrations, such as Independence Day 
and New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggests keeping pets indoors if possible, or having a veterinarian 
prescribe a mild tranquilizer. If you cannot stay with your pet, arrange for 
someone to care for it for the evening. LYNN FRANEY

MEMBER OF NEW GRAND JURY DRAWS FIRE OF LATINO GROUPS; LAW: THE JUROR IS 
ASSAILED AFTER DESCRIBING A REPORT SENT TO THE PANEL BY LOS AMIGOS AS 
'LOBBYING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the new Orange County Grand Jury was sworn in Friday, one member had 
already raised the ire of Latino community groups that worked more closely than 
ever before with the previous grand jury to help diversify the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Seth M. Oberg, a new grand juror, this week characterized a report that a 
Latino group sent the grand jury offering pointers on ethnic sensitivity as 
"lobbying," which Oberg said was a routine practice by many groups that write 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, that felt like a brush off.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lobbying for what? For equality, for justice, for balance? These letters 
aren't to peddle influence," said Amin David, chairman of Los Amigos of Orange 
County, which penned the report and has written to the grand jury many times 
asking that certain issues be explored. 
</P>
<P>
 Added John Palacio, of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund: "I don't think we're really talking about lobbying. We're talking about 
the Latino community trying to give input about issues important to the Latino 
community. It's an effort to educate." 
</P>
<P>
 David pointed out that Oberg himself has engaged in so-called lobbying. The 
retired pilot and president of the Dover Shores Community Assn. requested a 
grand jury investigation of the threat posed to his neighborhood by commercial 
aircraft that deviate from their takeoff route after leaving John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury released a report on the issue earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Oberg stood by his comment on the Los Amigos sensitivity report, 
saying it felt like lobbying to him. The packet criticized members of former 
grand juries for their positions on immigration and called on new jurors to be 
"impartial, courageous and diligent." 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was lobbying. Why should they write to me if it wasn't?" Oberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups should just give the new grand jury a chance to do its job, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past grand jury did a tremendous job in trying to diversify this panel 
and they were successful," Oberg said. "Los Amigos should wait and see how this 
grand jury performs." 
</P>
<P>
 He made his comments Friday, just minutes after Superior Court Judge Michael 
Brenner charged the new jurors to carry out their responsibilities during a 
swearing-in ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge thanked and formally discharged the outgoing grand jury members from 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
 That jury launched an unprecedented recruitment effort designed to diversify 
the ethnic and age makeup of the jury, putting the call out for applicants in 
public service announcements, churches and community centers countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993-94 grand jury was the first ever to welcome community groups into its 
chambers and seek suggestions on how to make the panel more representative of 
Orange County's population. 
</P>
<P>
 A special issues committee was formed to head that effort, and MALDEF members 
contributed time and money to help with the outreach and translate the grand 
jury's promotional material, said Bahia Wilson, former chairwoman of the 
1993-94 jury's special issues committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is a 19-member citizen panel that considers filing criminal 
indictments and acts as watchdog over local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Lazo Jr., a Havana-born graduate of Harvard University and the Wharton 
Business School, was selected as foreman of the new jury earlier this month, 
Wilson said, making him the first Latino foreman in the county's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing jurors were quick to say Friday that the 128 letters they received 
from the community during their year of service were not construed as lobbying, 
but as a key source of information about community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a lobbying of the grand jury," Wilson said. "It's an independent 
body. Our charge is to investigate. The Orange County Grand Jury receives 
letters from citizens, from civic groups, from wherever, and the mandate is we 
answer those letters." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson said she felt the Los Amigos report should have better acknowledged 
the efforts that the outgoing jury made. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the history of this grand jury, we now have the first Latino as a foreman, 
and Amin David didn't say one thing about that. It seems to me that if Amin 
David is going to do a job on the grand jury, at least do a balanced job, and 
I'm speaking now as a private citizen, because I was discharged today," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 David said Los Amigos does recognize the changes and said so in the report, 
which lauded "the notable effort made" by the outgoing grand jury.

 You could say it's so good it simply rocketed into the Top 5 on merit -- but 
that's not the real story. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaliyah's "Back & Forth" is a fixture in the pop Top 5 partly because of R. 
Kelly, one of the hottest artists in the business since his "12 Play" album 
sold more than 3 million copies. He not only produced and wrote "Back & Forth," 
but he also does the rapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting airplay for a single by a new artist is tough -- unless it features R. 
Kelly doing everything but the lead vocals. Fans love just about anything he 
does, and "Back & Forth" is the next best thing to a new R. Kelly single. Also, 
Aaliyah's debut album, "Age Ain't Nothing but a Number," jumped into the pop 
Top 20. That R. Kelly connection -- he wrote and produced the collection -- is 
a major factor in the album's success too. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Aaliyah (pronounced ah-LEE-yah) get testy at the suggestion that she has 
soared to fame on R. Kelly's coattails? 
</P>
<P>
 Not really. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know having him on the single helped it get attention," says Aaliyah, whose 
last name is Haughton. "Without him it would have been harder to get airplay. 
I'm just thankful for the break. If I had no talent and had nothing to offer, 
I'd probably feel funny if people were giving him all the credit. But I know I 
can sing and a lot of the success is because of me." 
</P>
<P>
 There are two sides to Aaliyah. On the one hand, she has the image of a 
streetwise tough girl who could easily pass for 20. But then there's also the 
genteel, ladylike 15-year-old who's majoring in dance at the Detroit's High 
School for Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 So which is the real Aaliyah? 
</P>
<P>
 Because that soft-spoken, sophisticated side of her is so dominant, you get 
the impression she's not really a street type. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the real me -- it's hard to say," she says in a telephone interview. 
"I have a feeling for the hard-core street life, but I like to hang out in 
malls. I'm definitely going to college, and I'd like to get a doctorate in 
music history, with a minor in engineering. But I love singing more than 
anything. What does all that say about me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Aaliyah has been dreaming about a show-biz career ever since she was a 
youngster. "I'd sing at the drop of a hat," she says. "I did some performing as 
a kid and I loved it. I had great feeling for it. I had it in my mind that's 
the career I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 It helped her show-biz aspirations to have an uncle, Barry Hankerson, who's an 
artists' manager. A few years ago, he became R. Kelly's manager too. Now he's 
also her manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I signed her about four years ago, long before I met Robert (R. Kelly)," he 
explains. "When she was about 10 or 11, I took her to Warner Bros. and MCA 
Records. They liked her singing, but they didn't sign her. Robert was impressed 
too when she first sang for him. She sang a cappella, and he said she has 
perfect pitch. He decided he wanted to work with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Jive Records, also Kelly's label, signed her two years ago. The tough part 
about making this album was Kelly writing from the point of view of a 
15-year-old female. "He just spent time with me, trying to see how I thought 
about things and what people my age think," she explains. "It may seem funny 
for him to do an album like this, but he has ideas about different things that 
he can't use on his albums." 
</P>
<P>
 Since they started the project, the question she's most often asked: What's a 
nice girl like you doing with a seeming rogue like him? 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me if my parents mind me working with someone like him," Aaliyah 
says. "But they're thinking about the guy they see on stage or the guy who 
makes those sexy albums. But that's his stage image. It's just one side of him 
-- not the side I see. He's really a sweet guy."
