 Kim Philby -- spy, traitor, philanderer, drunk -- died in 1988 at an exclusive 
clinic in Moscow, his home for a quarter century. For services rendered, the 
Soviet state provided a lavish, limited-admission funeral at the extremely 
exclusive KGB Club. There the spy agency's top officers delivered secret 
eulogies on the murky career of their English friend and ideological trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the open casket was hauled to the even more exclusive Kuntsevo 
Cemetery, where Philby's fourth wife gave him a final tender kiss. Before the 
coffin was sealed, some in the graveside crowd claimed to see a faint, 
enigmatic smile on the lips of the well-tended corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether real or sculpted by a subtle mortician, the expression was as 
ambiguous as Philby's life. As "the spy of the century," Philby was a genius at 
eluding sharp focus. Thanks partly to his great personal charm, he was able to 
sugarcoat his treason even after his damning flight from the West to the Soviet 
Union in 1963. And thanks partly to his knack for self-promotion and 
propaganda, Philby became one of the Cold War's superstars -- without ever 
revealing very much about himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The affable, deceitful man with a large whiskey capacity has intrigued 
journalists, playwrights, novelists and filmmakers, all of whom have found 
eager audiences for their interpretations of Philby's shadow world. Indeed, his 
extraordinary double career with Great Britain's Secret Intelligence Service 
and an alphabet soup of Soviet espionage agencies made him a sort of George 
Washington of spies. His house in Istanbul, where he was posted in the late 
1940s, became a tourist attraction. Other haunts, such as his favorite bar in 
Beirut, also acquired luster from their association with Philby. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Philby's death, of course, the world has been turned upside down, as two 
new books on his life demonstrate. Both Anthony Cave Brown's "Treason in the 
Blood" and Genrikh Borovik and Phillip Knightley's "The Philby Files" owe much 
to the opening of Cold War sources, including chunks of Philby's official KGB 
file and his personal papers. Although there probably never will be a final 
word on Philby simply because of the clandestine nature of espionage, the two 
volumes throw new light on vast stretches of his bizarre and puzzling life. 
</P>
<P>
 Cave Brown's fascinating father-son biography is the most thorough account 
likely to be written on Kim Philby and his exceedingly odd family roots. A 
major thesis of "Treason in the Blood" is that St. John Philby's example 
influenced his son's betrayal of Great Britain. As the tale unfolds, the lives 
of father and son take on an eerie, fun house-mirror quality that makes you 
wonder if treason could be an inherited trait. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Philby was a strange duck, an anti-imperialist who railed and 
schemed against the British Empire while he craved recognition from it. He 
became famous for his exploits during and after World War I, including 
exploration of the desolate Empty Quarter of the Arabian peninsula, but 
resigned from government service under a cloud shortly after the war. He was 
held in detention later, during World War II, because of suspect loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John Philby played a major role in the politics of Middle Eastern oil, 
ensuring that the vast Saudi oil fields would be developed by America rather 
than Britain. As an adviser to Saudi Arabia's King Ibn Saud, he converted to 
the Muslim faith and fathered a second family -- without ever divorcing Kim's 
mother. He seldom saw his English family but tried to direct it via the remote 
control of his voluminous letters. In the case of Kim, he succeeded, perhaps 
beyond his most fevered wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sired and perhaps inspired by a compulsive iconoclast, Kim Philby claimed that 
he began to doubt the existence of God while still in kindergarten. He also 
boasted that he had become "a godless little anti-imperialist before I reached 
my teens." (This from a person thought to have been one of the models for A. A. 
Milne's Christopher Robin.) 
</P>
<P>
 As Cave Brown portrays them, Kim and his father, St. John, lived on the fringe 
of history. Both were behind-the-scenes types, albeit not always by choice. 
Both influenced world events in profound ways. Both chose to serve foreign 
masters who used them even while they distrusted them. Both were deeply 
alienated from their native country, yet each epitomized a certain kind of 
Englishness. Both went to the right schools, knew all the right people and had 
the intelligence and capacity for work to make the best of both. 
</P>
<P>
 The father-son symbiosis also may have gone deeper than mere example. 
According to Cave Brown, the possibility exists that the senior Philby played a 
role in his son's recruitment to the Soviet cause. He bases this conjecture on 
testimony that the Soviet government regarded the father as "an asset" and that 
a KGB file on St. John Philby had been placed inside his son's file -- then 
later removed. Yet one wonders; both of these books present persuasive evidence 
that one of Kim's first jobs for the Soviets was to spy on his own father. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, friends sometimes thought both Philbys mad. In Kim, the 
signs of instability were less overt than in his father. Nonetheless one 
colleague eventually concluded that the son was "a schizophrenic with a supreme 
talent for deception." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his mental condition, Philby was superb at what he did. He began 
working for the Soviets in 1934 at age 22 and apparently served them faithfully 
and well for more than half a century. He helped recruit fellow leftist friends 
from Cambridge University into Communist service, most notably Donald MacLean, 
Guy Burgess and Anthony Blount. He provided the Soviets with mountains of 
high-quality information on military and diplomatic matters during the Spanish 
Civil War, World War II and the early years of the Cold War. He also betrayed 
anti-Communist agents and sent many to certain death. At the same time he 
fashioned successful careers in journalism and in British intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his fabulous luck and skill, Philby's world began to come apart in the 
early 1950s, when Burgess and MacLean fled behind the Iron Curtain, throwing 
suspicion on Philby as "the third man" who had made the escape possible. Still 
Philby managed to hold on for 12 years before fleeing himself. In that time he 
was more or less constantly suspected of dark deeds but investigators could pin 
nothing on their slippery target. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, Philby was bedeviled by the collapse of his second marriage 
and the need to earn a living. Aileen Philby was in and out of mental 
institutions (she cut herself with scissors and sometimes injected herself with 
her own urine), but it is almost inconceivable that she knew nothing of his 
double life. Philby apparently was never sure whether she would rat on him. At 
one point, Cave Brown reports, Philby's domestic situation required him to 
sleep in a tent pitched on the yard of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately and astonishingly, he was rehired by the British secret service and 
sent to Beirut under journalistic cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Cave Brown covers all this and more with a wonderful feel for the absurdities 
of British and American spy mania in the 1950s and early '60s. In a delicious 
tidbit among many, reports that British P. M. Harold Macmillan despaired that 
the security scandals would never end. At the close of one particularly bad 
day, Macmillan wrote in his diary that yet another British agent had been 
arrested, this time for "wandering around the loos in the park, passing things, 
probably opium or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Cave Brown's best efforts, questions remain about Philby's flight from 
Beirut aboard a Soviet freighter in 1963. Was Philby planted in Moscow by the 
British and Americans or was he a genuine defector? Cave Brown concludes that 
"we shall not know, for the Philby case was one in which the secret services of 
all three countries involved -- Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United 
States -- found it necessary to keep silent. No individual told the whole truth 
about what lay behind the affair, least of all Philby." 
</P>
<P>
 Cave Brown also concedes that the truth behind the celebrated relationship 
between Philby and the CIA's James Jesus Angleton remains beyond grasp. Did 
Angleton, the counterintelligence guru of the American agency, hoodwink Philby 
or did Philby checkmate Angleton? Apparently no one knows the answer. But Cave 
Brown presents evidence based on "private information" that two CIA executives 
who distrusted Angleton met untimely deaths, which leaves open the possibility 
that Angleton and Philby were in cahoots. 
</P>
<P>
 After the feast of "Treason in the Blood," Borovik and Knightley's book seems 
like small potatoes. The impression is deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
 Borovik, a Moscow writer and TV personality, was given access to one volume of 
Philby's KGB files (the KGB had suppressed a novel of his; this access, he 
claims, was his pay-back). The files primarily covered Philby's first years as 
a spy for the Soviets. He also had access to Philby and conducted extensive 
interviews with him in the years shortly before his death. Knightley, a 
well-known British journalist and author of a Philby biography, edited 
Borovik's manuscript and wrote an introduction. The result is an awkward book 
that nonetheless contains a great deal of insight into the nuts and bolts of 
Philby's secret life. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Borovik reports that Philby and other English spies were 
deeply distrusted by the KGB, which suspected all were double agents. He also 
reports that, unlike recently exposed CIA turncoat Alrich Ames, the British 
spies were reluctant to take money for their work. The reasons for refusal were 
both practical and idealistic. They believed in their cause and none wanted the 
suspicion extra cash bestows. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Borovik was able to compare Philby's words with his files. Not 
surprisingly, Philby lied to him or was less than forthcoming on occasion, 
including about his little-known involvement in a plot to kill Spain's General 
Francisco Franco. 
</P>
<P>
 Both books provide fascinating detail on Philby's last days, an indicator of 
the kind of information that is now accessible in Russia. Cave Brown notes that 
doctors searched high and low for a special Uzbeki wine believed helpful in 
treating his heart condition (they got it from the Archimandrite of Moscow; it 
seemed to help for a bit). And Borovik writes that in the month before his 
death, Philby's chronic insomnia had recurred with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 So in the end, Philby could not sleep until he slept forever. What was it, one 
wonders, that kept him awake?

<P>
 Ted Shackley was appropriately called the "Blond Ghost" by his CIA colleagues, 
for he quietly ran the show without ever leaving fingerprints. The nickname was 
not at all intended to flatter. As point man for a generation's worth of agency 
escapades from the Cuban missile crisis to Irangate, Shackley earned the 
reputation of a survivor who had risen rapidly in the ranks by dutifully 
carrying out orders, no matter how bizarre they might be -- and without ever 
being tarred with responsibility for the debacle that ensued. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalist David Corn, in his fast-paced and provocative book, has managed to 
get the still tight-lipped crowd that worked with Shackley to talk. Thanks also 
to Corn's skillful combing of long secret but newly released public records, we 
finally get inside the head of a man whose career thrived on national disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Shackley who managed the huge CIA station in Miami during the Kennedy 
years and who dispatched Cuban emigres and American Mafiosi alike to 
assassinate Fidel Castro and burn Cuba's sugar fields. Yet even though 
Shackley's and the agency's record in attempting to overthrow the Cuban 
president was marked by ineptitude worthy of the Keystone Kops -- producing 
results that were always disastrous when they weren't merely humorous -- 
Shackley was rewarded with the CIA's sensitive Laotian desk after leaving the 
Caribbean theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Historical accountability only caught up with the Blond Ghost when he became a 
target of a congressional investigation of Irangate for his activities soon 
after retiring from the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs Shackley performed for the U.S. government throughout his decades of 
intrigue were repetitious to the point of dullness: laundering illicitly 
obtained money, trafficking with drug runners, hiring hoodlums and free-lance 
killers. The sense one is left with is of the quintessential government goon, 
who could have carried out the orders of the most monstrous of leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the leaders of the CIA and the presidents it pretended to report 
to were not monsters. Instead, as Peter Grose's excellent and long-needed 
biography of Allen Dulles, the seminal figure in the agency's history, 
demonstrates, they were highly intelligent, well-educated, inherently elitist, 
but almost always immature. Despite Grose's somewhat gingerly and overly 
forgiving stance, which at times strains credulity, Dulles and his 
contemporaries at the top of the agency's hierarchy come across as hyperactive 
kids who refused to grow up and remained, into ripe old age, hooked on the 
sugar of intrigue. As a result, men like Allen Dulles and Ted Shackley became 
"Park Avenue cowboys," overly warming to the agency's covert operations while 
effectively undermining its crucial information-gathering functions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gentleman Spy" is just right as a title for summarizing Allen Dulles' long 
career with the CIA, which he directed from 1953 to 1961. (His first name is 
always used because Allen always operated in close proximity to his even more 
famous brother, John Foster Dulles, U.S. secretary of state from 1953 to 1959.) 
Educated in the best schools and wined and dined at the finest watering holes, 
Allen Dulles became a corporate lawyer and partner in the Sullivan & Cromwell 
firm that represented many top business clients with investments abroad. When 
he entered government service, he suddenly found himself empowered to act 
against -- even to order the execution of -- people who dared question the 
propriety of U.S. foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 As Grose notes, for Allen, "trade, generally speaking, was the flag. American 
national and business interests were parallel and complementary. He may have 
felt that his roles as a lawyer for private clients and as unofficial 
representative of the U.S. government occasionally conflicted, but only on 
technical, operational matters, never on fundamental purpose. . . . In the 
implementation of his philosophy over decades to come, in lands as far afield 
as Iran and Guatemala, Allen never felt obliged to explain or justify why 
American business and American government (or at least the one sensitive branch 
for which he was responsible) were working in such intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Dulles's anti-business targets was Jacobo Arbenz, the elected leader of 
Guatemala. Arbenz had ruffled the feathers of top executives of the United 
Fruit Co., who were accustomed to treating Guatemala as an obsequious 
franchise. In the 1950s there was no politically correct hand-wringing over 
conflict of interest, so it did not seem to matter that the law firm where 
Allen and his brother (by then secretary of state) had been senior partners had 
represented United Fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was therefore without qualm, and without any serious criticism in the U.S. 
media, that Allen ordered, in Grose's words, "nothing less than the overthrow 
of a duly elected government," in an operation he labeled "Operation Success." 
And it was, if success is represented by overthrowing an elected leader who 
made gestures at redistributing United Fruit land to his mostly poor and 
landless countrymen. The result is that Guatemala has been ruled almost ever 
since by ruthless, military-backed dictators, and many thousands have fled the 
country to escape repression. Any Guatemalan in Los Angeles now struggling to 
prove legitimacy in the aftermath of Proposition 187 could rightfully list 
Allen Dulles as the sponsor for their green card. 
</P>
<P>
 Dulles' exploits were endless, from the overthrow of nationalist Mohammad 
Mossadegh in Iran because he dared to challenge the power of the big oil 
companies to the bolstering of the U.S. gangster-dominated Cuban dictator 
Fulgencio Batista as a solid American ally and an alternative to radicals 
clamoring for land reform and other annoyances against U.S. corporate 
interests. As a direct result of this successful policy of "neutralizing" more 
moderate reformers, we now have the Ayatollah in Iran and Castro in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Grose, however, makes the important point that these were not rogue efforts on 
the part of the CIA. Rather, Allen Dulles "was responding to orders from the 
highest levels of government." But the CIA, with and without Allen, abetted 
executive madness by supplying overly optimistic and very simplistic 
assessments of the risks involved. In much of this, Allen's great strength lay 
in the fact that he was an extremely talented charlatan. 
</P>
<P>
 He was that also in his personal life, cheating on his wife with great abandon 
and almost totally neglecting his children. Indeed, Grose implies that Allen 
conducted an affair with Queen Frederika of Greece -- using a changing room off 
his office when she visited CIA headquarters. His other extramarital affairs, 
according to Grose, included the daughter of composer Toscanini and even the 
pristine Clare Booth Luce. (This from the head of an intelligence agency which, 
like its counterparts everywhere, argued that homosexuals needed to be drummed 
out because they were open to blackmail!) 
</P>
<P>
 One comes away from these books thinking that the whole covert-action spy 
business should be folded, since it is difficult to see what it ever 
accomplished. The collective effect of reading these books is that America and 
the world would have been better off if the CIA had never existed, and that 
there would be no great loss in abolishing the agency now. As even Allen Dulles 
conceded shortly before his death in 1969, "perhaps we have already intervened 
too much in the affairs of other peoples." 
</P>
<P>
 These complex but very reasonable portraits of Dulles and Shackley, two very 
different but crucial figures in the history of the CIA, represent breakthrough 
insights into the murkiest corner of our national life these past 50 years. 
Thanks to the release of massive amounts of once highly classified information 
and the willingness of once secretive actors in this drama to talk, David Corn 
and Peter Grose have managed to produce landmark works that together tell us 
quite a bit about an invisible government which we citizens paid for and which 
acted in our name free of any serious checks by elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Refreshingly enough, both works were written out of reserves of empathy as 
they track the zany and most often contradictory and failed efforts of two men 
who worked to bring order to a world and ended by being major agents of its 
chaos. The authors also have avoided the temptation to bathe in the massive 
river of once-secret data now undammed by the end of the Cold War; instead they 
channel the flow though the banks of previously developed historiography. The 
musty stacks of a first-rate library are still useful even in the age of the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Mark Riebling, the author of "Wedge," drowned in the new 
information river. This tome appears to be a repository for every possible 
document reference in which the acronyms FBI and CIA appeared together. They 
are then regurgitated in chronological order to sustain the notion that a 
battle between the two security agencies drove the contretemps of U.S. Cold War 
policy. Not a bad concept on which to sell a book to a publisher. But this 
grand thesis is not supported in the telling here despite overwhelming detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously World War II brought the United States into a new relationship with 
the world, and everyone recognized that it would be essential to have a central 
intelligence agency of some sort. It was to be expected that the head of the 
FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, a man used to having his way with secret data as well as 
with presidents, would feel threatened by the new sleuths on the block. But 
this work strains credulity when it insists rather than proves that the two 
agencies worked at serious cross-purposes. Yes, there were endless turf 
battles, jealously guarded prerogatives and petty refusals to share files. So 
what else is new? But on no major point did the heads of these two agencies 
disagree regarding the fundamentals of U.S. foreign policy, and indeed they 
shared a passion for the more simplistic excesses of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI was kept at a distance from foreign policy, although often not distant 
enough. The reason was obvious: The G-men were inexperienced and indeed 
ignorant about the world outside of the Western Hemisphere. More important, 
there is a profound impulse that cuts across the political spectrum that 
government secrecy and intrigue ought not to be concentrated exclusively in one 
government bureaucratic nest in Washington. If that is not the whole 
significance of FBI-CIA tension, and I do this book an injustice, perhaps 
someone could produce Cliff Notes to help me and other would-be readers out.

 Imagine two factories standing side by side, each dedicated to turning out a 
product quite the opposite of what the other produces. Each works efficiently 
for a constituency that waits eagerly for what comes off the line. The sign 
above one factory could read "Western Myths" while the sign above the other 
could be "Western Realities." Just to confuse matters, imagine that each 
facility uses the same raw material as the other. And let's make it worse 
still. Both factories have run out of labels, so it's not clear which product 
came from which factory. Is that the real Wild Bill Hickok? Was there only one 
Custer? One Sitting Bull? 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago I attended a writers conference devoted to Western Literature and 
Western Writers. During a panel discussion, one of the participants announced, 
"There's no such thing as the West." His remark did not outrage or offend or 
bring the conference to a halt. Everyone nodded in agreement -- certainly we 
know there's no such thing as the West, by now everyone knows that -- and then 
we blithely went on trying on different definitions of the West like so many 
hats. Most of them made by Stetson. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem stems from the means of definition. Some want to talk 
about place, others soul. Others choose to base their definition on economics 
or annual rainfall or the distance between neighbors. Still others want to 
focus on whether boots are fitted with riding or walking heels. Consider the 
word frontier, used so frequently in discussions and depictions of the West, 
yet the battle over its meaning has been as intense -- albeit bloodless -- as 
any range war. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Frontier in American Culture," a volume intended to accompany an 
exhibition at Chicago's Newberry Library, historians Richard White and Patricia 
Nelson Limerick survey this struggle over the concept of frontier. White and 
Limerick are perhaps the most notable of recent historians who have questioned 
and re-examined traditional views of the American West. Both historians write 
such lucid prose and bring so much intelligence, insight and careful reasoning 
to their work that it's difficult not to be persuaded by their arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 White concentrates on a single, strange moment in history from which sprang 
two contradictory definitions of frontier. In 1893, at the Columbian Exposition 
in Chicago, Frederick Jackson Turner, a historian from the University of 
Wisconsin, advanced his thesis that the availability in America of vast areas 
of so-called "free land" was the crucial factor in the nation's development. At 
the same time Professor Turner was delivering his lecture, Buffalo Bill Cody 
had his famous Wild West Show in town depicting a much different version of the 
settling of the West. Where Turner wanted to emphasize farmers, oxen and plows, 
Buffalo Bill offered scouts, horses and bullets. (Also at the Columbian 
Exposition was Rain-in-the-Face, the Lakota reputed to have killed Custer, but 
then for Native Americans, any theory of frontier made no sense and was likely 
only to bring them more grief.) 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Turner nor Cody was correct, in White's view, but he is concerned with 
another issue. How could these two versions of the frontier, as different as 
they are, manage to grab and keep such a tight hold on the American mind? 
Because, White says, both Turner and Cody appropriated the symbols and icons of 
previous events and existing myths, weaving them into new narratives. 
</P>
<P>
 Limerick finds not only the concept of frontier flawed, but the word itself 
debased in its ubiquity. She attempts to catalogue its appearances and finds it 
everywhere -- politicians sprinkle it throughout their speeches, newspapers 
love to use it in their headlines, and everyone with something to sell, it 
seems, works it into an advertising slogan. Inevitably, a word that can mean 
everything means nothing. It is no wonder that many academic historians, 
Limerick among them, shy away from the "f-word," and will go to great lengths 
to avoid its use. It is not only its vagueness they abjure but also its 
ethnocentrism. Whether you follow the trail leading from Turner or Cody, it is 
obviously a road meant for white males. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Brown is not afraid to use the f-word, yet one would not want to place him 
in the same camp as the myth-makers. Indeed, his "Bury My Heart at Wounded 
Knee" probably did as much as any book to increase awareness of the historical 
mistreatment of Native Americans. But Brown writes popular rather than academic 
history, and if he cannot keep the slightly awe-struck tone from his writing 
about the Old West it is because he believes it was "simply a place of magic 
and wonders." 
</P>
<P>
 His wondrous "The American West" is a one volume distillation of three earlier 
books of Western history co-written with Martin Schmitt largely to provide a 
narrative framework for collections of photographs. And the photographs are 
here as well, of Red Cloud and Sitting Bull and Geronimo and Wild Bill Hickok 
and George Armstrong Custer and Teddy Roosevelt, with stories to accompany 
them. Brown cautions against confusing true history with myth, but what are you 
going to do when the life itself, even without exaggeration or adornment, seems 
the stuff of legend? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there must be a movie in the life of Sarah Winnemucca, the 
granddaughter of a Shoshone chief and wife of a U.S. Army officer, who managed 
to work in the interests of both sides. Or in Arthur Balfour, who came from 
England, bought himself a "big hat, boots, and a red bandanna," and signed on 
as a Bar X cowhand and learned why the ranch was earning no profits for its 
British investors. Or in Prairie Rose, who, to collect a $50 wager, walked 
naked down the main street of Ellsworth, Kansas "with a six-gun in each hand to 
shoot out any eye that showed." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no Western history that aims to be at all comprehensive can fail to 
record the policies and practices -- exploitative and paternalistic at best, 
genocidal at worst -- directed toward the Native American population. In 
chapter after chapter, Brown tells stories that, no matter what the beginning, 
always have the same ending: Tribes driven from their lands, mighty chiefs 
stripped of their power, hunters and warriors reduced to living on handouts. 
With astonishing swiftness, the rituals and structures of societies that had 
existed for centuries were altered forever. Brown documents these losses until, 
finally, the American West feels more like elegy than history. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of loss shows up again and again in the work of contemporary Western 
writers. Throughout "Northern Lights," an anthology edited by Deborah Clow and 
Donald Snow, are laments for rivers, forests, animals, families, wilderness, 
innocence, silence, civility. . . . When John Daniel describes a clear-cut 
Northwestern forest, he does it in a way that makes it possible to see what 
once was there. In a remarkably ambitious essay, Leslie Ryan connects hunting, 
fishing, logging, rape, the movie "Silence of the Lambs" and loss of trust. 
There is plenty of finger-pointing in these pages -- at the Forest Service, the 
Atomic Energy Commission, at ranchers, Easterners, whites -- yet when David 
Quammen points out that certain animal species are missing from our national 
parks he says it is a crime without a criminal. Crime is on the mind of William 
Kittredge, and he sees its prevalence as a consequence of having lost the 
stories that once showed us how to live peaceably together. In "Letters to an 
Architect," Gretel Ehrlich meditates on space, interior and exterior, and on 
what the effects might be as we seal ourselves off from the elements. Terry 
Tempest Williams, in her moving, "The Clan of One-Breasted Women," writes of 
how many of the women in her family have lost their very future -- or the 
ability to believe in it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much fine writing in these pages that it's easy to conclude that 
the West is currently producing more writers of talent and vision than any 
other region. Perhaps awareness of loss provides that psychic wound that is 
reputed to result in creativity. Just as likely, it feeds an outrage that must 
have expression. 
</P>
<P>
 What is perhaps most remarkable about these recitations of destruction and 
deprivation is that they are about a region so new. But then the pain of loss 
can be all the more acute for what passes quickly. Or for what never was.

RICHARD EDER: THE KINDNESS OF LIBERALS; OF THE LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF MARY 
SHELLEY; SELECTED LETTERS OF MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY, EDITED BY BETTY T. 
BENNETT (THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY PRESS: $19.95; 480 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 A radical English reformer, and widower of the eminently nonconforming 
feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin was shocked when their 
17-year-old daughter, Mary, eloped in 1814 with a married man. He refused to 
receive them. It was only when Percy Bysshe Shelley's wife, Harriet, 
regularized matters by drowning herself in the Serpentine that he relented. 
Magnanimously, he agreed to the lovers' marrying, and went on to ask his 
son-in-law for money. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the Godwin-Wollstonecraft-William Blake generation and that of the 
Shelley circle, there was a break somewhat like the one between aging American 
radicals from the '30s and their '60s flower-children. There was a hippie touch 
to the Shelleys, Byron and their followers. There was also -- because Byron was 
a lord and Shelley was gentry, and both had money and arrogance -- a touch of 
the Brat Pack. 
</P>
<P>
 After Shelley drowned in the Gulf of Spezia and Byron died of a fever in 
Greece, Mary was left to descend from timeless sublimities to daily squalors. 
It was, in fact, only a few years after their elopement -- and one magical Lake 
Geneva summer with Shelley, Byron and her sister, Claire, who was Byron's lover 
-- that things began to darken. Two children died not long after the 
Shelley-Byron pack settled in Italy. Shelley's health was precarious. There 
were infidelities including, perhaps, an affair with Claire; and all kinds of 
emotional drama. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1817 Mary was recalling the Lake Geneva idyll (it was there that 
she began writing "Frankenstein") with anguish. "Why is not life a continued 
moment where hours and days are not counted -- but as it is a succession of 
events happen -- the moment of enjoyment lives only in memory and when we die 
where are we?" she wrote her husband. If for Shelley time stained eternity 
"like a dome of many-colored glass," for Mary the endless days of the rest of 
her life were shards of darker and darker hues. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in London two years after the drowning, lonely and struggling to support 
herself, Mary wrote to Edward Trelawny, a close friend at the time: "The eight 
years that I passed with our lost Shelley does not appear a dream, for my 
present existence is more like that -- surely his state is not more changed 
than mine. When I first came to England, change of scene, the seeing old 
friends and the excitement with which the uncertainty of my situation inspired 
me, made me, though not happy, yet pass the day unrepining. But now each hour 
seems to add a load of intolerable melancholy." 
</P>
<P>
 Melancholy alternating with anger are the leading notes in many of the letters 
published in this selection, an abridgment of the three-volume edition edited 
by Betty T. Bennett. Bennett has included her copious and illuminating 
footnotes, and the introduction she wrote for the longer version. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Shelley was not a natural letter-writer. She writes sentiments, often 
eloquent ones; and she writes concrete needs, disasters and appeals, often 
touching ones. What she lacks is intimacy and a taste for communicating 
particular things. She is better at vision than observation; the letters give a 
sense of her feelings but not of herself; they convey what others have done or 
failed to do but not much sense of who these others are. 
</P>
<P>
 All her life she was plagued with accusations of coldness. They were made by 
former friends. (As some people have a talent for friends, Mary Shelley had a 
talent for former friends.) She denied it passionately, but passion is not 
really the opposite of coldness. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, she had much reason to be cold; and when the coldness gives 
way to naked anguish she writes with great power. Bennett is certainly right in 
distinguishing the difficulties of an unconventional woman fighting to write 
and to live in a man's world. Even before there was much bruising she had to 
contend with Sir Walter Scott's review of "Frankenstein." It was admiring, and 
that was the trouble: He assumed that Shelley must have written it. Mary 
couldn't afford to be angry with the master, but there is sharp if concealed 
irony in her ostensibly mouse-like rejoinder (in the early letters she refers 
to herself several times as "mouse" or "dormouse."). "Frankenstein," she wrote, 
was certainly hers; it was far too "juvenile" to be Shelley's. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught up in her husband's lofty west wind, she was blown about Italy, bearing 
-- and losing -- one baby after another. The letter telling of Shelley's 
disappearance, her anguished efforts to find out what had happened, the growing 
evidence that he was lost and the discovery of his body is vividly and movingly 
written. After his death she was penniless. His father refused to see her, 
initially withheld any financial assistance, and finally settled on the most 
meager of allowances -- on condition that she not publish anything about 
Shelley during his own lifetime. "Sir Tim," she wrote in a wonderfully 
penetrating phrase, "writhes under the fame of his incomparable son as if it 
were a most grievous injury done him -- and so, perhaps it will prove." 
</P>
<P>
 She settled in bleak London quarters to earn money with her pen: novels, short 
stories, essays, travel books and potted collections of literary lives. "It is 
pleasant writing enough," she comments of her Grub Street routine, "sparing 
ones imagination yet occupying one and supplying in some degree the needful 
which is so very needful." Earlier, she had announced her resolution to survive 
her bereavement and fight to support herself and her cherished son Percy: 
</P>
<P>
 "Life must run its course, I will not as formerly be at pains of decorating 
its banks -- it runs to the sea of repose." To Byron, she wrote: "I am cold 
moonshine." 
</P>
<P>
 In this selection, there is correspondence with several men who were 
romantically interested in her -- Prosper Merimee, among others -- though not 
with one or two others where the interest was hers. The strongest passion 
revealed, which certainly verges on the romantic, is for her close friend Jane 
Williams. There is a powerfully voiced bitterness when she learns that Williams 
has "betrayed" her by denouncing her to friends as selfish and cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her most painful experiences were at the hands of former members of 
the Shelley circle: men who denounced her for betraying his lofty memory by 
editing contentious passages from some of his poems; or, in the case of the 
previously devoted Trelawny, for making friends with a circle of women whom he 
deemed intellectually and politically unworthy of her husband's radical legacy. 
A legacy is a hard thing to live on -- particularly when it brings no cash. Her 
reply is both fierce and affecting: 
</P>
<P>
 "You may pick and choose those from whom you deign to receive kindness -- You 
are a Man at a feast -- Champagne and comfits your diet -- & you naturally 
scoff at me and my dry crust in a corner -- often have you scoffed and sneered 
at all the aliment of kindness or society that fate has afforded me." As for 
her, she writes: "The only persons who deigned to share those melancholy hours, 
and afford me the balm of affection were those dear girls whom you chose so 
long to abuse." And finally: "One thing I will add -- if I have ever found 
kindness it has not been from liberals."

COVER STORY: THE ROAD TRIP 'HOME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Originally, Kirk Douglas planned to star with his Oscar-winning son Michael in 
the father-son drama "Take Me Home Again," which premieres Sunday on NBC. But 
the timing wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
 "About three years ago, Michael sent me the script," Douglas, a rugged 78, 
recalls in his Beverly Hills office. "We have been looking for about five years 
for something to do together. He said, 'I think I got something.' And he sent 
me the script." 
</P>
<P>
 But Douglas thought the script by Ernest Thompson ("On Golden Pond"), about a 
dying man and his estranged son who travel cross-country so he can die in the 
bed he was born in, was too "down." 
</P>
<P>
 So he told Michael, "We will find something better." About nine months ago, 
Douglas was sent the script again. The second time around, Douglas really liked 
it. "I said, 'Michael, you're right. Let's do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Douglas fils was set to do two movies. So while Michael was making the 
high-profile Christmas release "Disclosure," Douglas was off doing "Take Me 
Home Again," not as a theatrical film, but for the small screen. Craig T. 
Nelson, star of the long-running ABC sitcom "Coach," came on board as Douglas' 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, who has starred in countless film classics, including "Champion," 
"The Bad and the Beautiful," "Lust for Life," "Spartacus" and "The Big 
Carnival" (also known as "Ace in the Hole") doesn't mind tht "Take Me Home 
Again" found a home on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have done about five or six TV movies ("Amos," "Inherit the Wind," "The 
Secret" among them) which I have liked," says Douglas, who describes himself as 
"a feisty guy," but comes across as easygoing and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of the ratings that they had, I think more people have seen 
those movies than have seen a lot of my theatrical movies. I think TV very 
often allows you to do a movie, not on a very expensive budget, on a subject 
that is very often difficult to do as a theatrical. I am more interested in 
finding something I enjoy playing. And 'Take Me Home Again' was really fun to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 And Douglas loved working with TV actor Nelson. "I found it very easy working 
with Craig. He is a real professional. He was very easy to work with, which was 
nice because we had so many scenes together." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas was a childhood idol of Nelson's. So needless to say, Nelson was 
thrilled to work with him. "I wasn't nervous," Nelson says. "I was just in awe. 
As a kid I had seen 'Spartacus' and it was just phenomenal to actually realize 
you are going to be working with this guy. I was terribly impressed. He was so 
professional, such a great guy." 
</P>
<P>
 And Douglas, Nelson says, insisted on a lot of rehearsal time. "He made sure 
of that," he says. "We had a lot of good times together. I was very fortunate 
to have that opportunity. It was a really wonderful shoot. It went by too 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Take Me Home Again," Douglas plays Ed Reece, a former traveling salesman 
who is dying of cancer. "I am the old geezer who wants to go back where he was 
born," he says with a flash of his famous blue eyes. Douglas says the film 
reminds him of Arthur Miller's landmark play "Death of a Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
 "From my point of view -- that's why I was so interested in it as a vehicle 
for Michael and me -- it is really about a father who wants to get back with 
his older son," he says. "It is usually that way. Very often, the oldest son is 
a rebel. It was that way with Michael. Michael was always a rebel. For the last 
eight years we have had a very close relationship. (Before that), we weren't 
close. Michael would always do his own thing and now, it is nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had breakfast this morning. I left a message for him: 'If you are free, 
come over to the house at 8 for breakfast.' And he came over and looked at his 
watch and said, 'Dad, it is 10 to 8. I said, 'Michael, you and I have that same 
quality, we have a compunction to be on time,' which my other sons don't 
share." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas believes he and the eldest of his four sons have bonded because 
Michael has carved out his own identity. "I think that happens with all kids, 
especially if their father is a strong father, a successful father. The sons 
have to find their own identity. Certainly, if Michael doesn't have his 
identity now he is never going to find it." 
</P>
<P>
 He also found a real kinship with Ed. "As I said before, the closest thing 
this reminds me of is 'Death of a Salesman.' Time goes on and you have been on 
the road so much. I can relate to that. When I was young, I was making three 
movies a year. You are not spending enough time with your kid. Suddenly you 
say, 'Wait a minute.' And you want to catch up on certain things. In a sense, 
this movie is catching up with your relationship with your son." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Douglas is still eager to work with Michael, writing is the elder 
Douglas' first priority these days. This past summer, he published his third 
novel, the critically acclaimed "Last Tango in Brooklyn." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas peruses the shelves of his office looking for a copy of the novel to 
give his visitor. He finally finds one and opens up the title page to autograph 
it. "Michael's company has been talking about making it into a movie," Douglas 
says, sliding the book across the desk. "I think you will enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Douglas is writing a sequel to his best-selling autobiography, "The 
Ragman's Son." 
</P>
<P>
 "My first book was looking back," he says. "My next one is going to be a 
continuation of my life story from a very different point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 The new book will start with Douglas' 1991 accident involving a helicopter in 
which he was a passenger. The helicopter collided with a light plane and 
Douglas was injured; the plane's two occupants were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will start with the helicopter crash, posing the question: 'Why am I 
alive?' These two people were killed and I felt so guilty. How does that 
happen? In a way, this will be a lot more introspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day, Douglas says, he wrote a chapter on his good friend and 
frequent co-star, Burt Lancaster, who died in October of a heart attack. He 
speaks about Lancaster with great warmth, affection and nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote a chapter just on our relationship and how I felt about Burt and a 
lot of stuff I don't think people had known," he says. "We did, like, seven 
movies together. We did song and dance routines. We did a play in San Francisco 
for six weeks. We fought and argued. He was a great guy. A lot of people didn't 
realize it, but Burt was a big opera buff. He loved opera. I always said, 'I am 
going to expose you, Burt. You are a big tough guy and I am going to expose you 
as the intellectual you really are.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas looks wistfully around at the film posters that adorn the walls: "The 
Bad and the Beautiful," "Seven Days in May," in which he co-starred with 
Lancaster, "Spartacus" and "The Last Sunset." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything about movies in my house," Douglas says. "Here I have 
all the posters. But when I was writing this article about Burt Lancaster, I 
looked around and began to see people (who I worked with) who are dead: Gloria 
Grahame, Gilbert Roland, Dick Powell, Ava Gardner, Burt Lancaster, Laurence 
Olivier, Rock Hudson, Charles Laughton. It was like the roll-call of the dead. 
You think, where did all the years go? How long have I been around? 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses. "I enjoy writing. You are just digging inside of yourself and 
talking about things." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas also is a recipient this year of the prestigious Kennedy Center 
Honors, along with director Harold Prince, folk singer Pete Seeger, soul diva 
Aretha Franklin and composer Morton Gould. CBS will telecast the Washington 
awards ceremony, which was taped Dec. 4, on Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I have said about (the honor) is you don't have to say anything," says 
Douglas, who received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are just properly modest and you sit in the presidential box and watch 
the show," he says with a smile. "You don't have to worry about making out a 
suitable acceptance speech. It is a nice award. I keep kidding people, 'Don't 
you think I am much too young for this prestigious honor?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving such honors has been a double-edged sword for Douglas. "I have 
gotten several lifetime achievement awards and you say, 'Wait a minute? Are you 
telling me it is all over?' Come on. I just did 'Take Me Home Again.' I am 
going to do a movie with Michael. I am writing another book. It's nice, but you 
wonder if they have looked at my medical records and said, 'We better give this 
guy an award fast.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Take Me Home Again" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on NBC; "The Kennedy Center Honors: 
A Celebration of the Performing Arts" airs Dec. 28 at 9 p.m. on CBS.

JUDGE AND JURIST; SUPREME COURT OPINIONS THAT CONTINUE TO SHAPE THE PRESENT; 
HUGO BLACK: A BIOGRAPHY, BY ROGER K. NEWMAN (PANTHEON BOOKS: $30; 741 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lincoln Caplan, Lincoln Caplan is a contributing editor of Newsweek. His 
most recent book, Skadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire, was 
published earlier this month by Noonday Press/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a Mt. Rushmore of Supreme Court greats, the stubborn, mesmerizing face of 
Hugo Black would be chiseled next to those of John Marshall, Oliver Wendell 
Holmes Jr. and one or two other justices. In a career spanning 34 years, from 
1937 until 1971, he issued gallant opinions that made the Bill of Rights a 
brawny protector of individual liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freedom to speak and write about public questions," Black wrote, "is the 
heart of our government." He translated the First Amendment's defense of that 
freedom into a rousing instrument of democracy, "without any 'ifs' or 'buts' or 
'whereas.' " He also reconstructed the amendment's religious guarantees into a 
wall between church and state. A generation after his death, Black's influence 
has recently been apparent once again. It is a 32-year-old landmark opinion by 
him explaining why the Supreme Court found organized school prayer "wholly 
inconsistent" with the Constitution that makes it necessary for the country to 
amend its fundamental law if such prayer is to be legal in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Black was also a son of Alabama's hill country, who owed his 1926 election to 
the U.S. Senate to his membership in and persistent courtship of the Ku Klux 
Klan. To Franklin Roosevelt, who picked him for the Court, to Senate colleagues 
who confirmed him quickly, to 40 million Americans who turned on their radios 
to hear him explain this tie after it was exposed by the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, and apparently to himself, Black never faced up to the epic 
contradiction of using that odious base as a springboard to a career as a 
liberal populist. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger K. Newman's "Hugo Black" is the first comprehensive biography of the 
illustrious, dodgy, fascinating jurist. For Supreme Court scholars, legal 
librarians and avid students of Southern politics and constitutional law, it's 
a thick compilation of anecdotal material worth owning. Newman had access to 
the justice's family, his one-time law clerks, and others in his circle, and he 
took profuse advantage of it. Newman's enthusiasm and sustained commitment were 
colossal: he started his research in 1968 and, he says, worked on the book full 
time from 1982 until it was done. The source notes alone fill 75 pages of the 
741-page volume and mark his relish for research. Newman even combed through 
Black's library, to cull marginalia from the justice's favorite titles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the book's failings are dumbfounding. For an author privileged to have 
support from major foundations and from New York University Law School as a 
research scholar, they raise the question: Who has the responsibility for 
quality control? In the acknowledgments, Newman thanks many estimable 
supporters but doesn't mention an editor. He desperately needed one. Instead of 
a biography, "Hugo Black" is more like a research file awaiting serious 
shaping: It's sprawling, often undiscriminating, and stuffed with irritating 
digressions; it's riddled with sections that bury the point and cliched 
sentences that don't have any. In the debate whether computers improve or 
undermine the quality of books, Newman's brick topples the scale to the 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
 One theory about Newman's problem as a biographer is that he got so close to 
his subject that he couldn't judge him and so did everything but. In Newman's 
epilogue, smugly called "Of Hugo and Me," he dubs the project his "obsession" 
and boasts about coming up with the idea of a stamp honoring the centennial of 
Black's birth in 1986 and about drafting the congressional law making that Hugo 
Black Day. Such promotional activity seems antithetical to the role of an 
independent biographer, which is how Newman presents himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Another theory is that, whatever his role, Newman lacked the capacity to 
explain Black coherently in a narrative biography. The best evidence to support 
this thought are tone-deaf Newman sentences that leave the impression of a 
gushing, simplistic viewpoint: "The ancient world spoke to him (Black) as if it 
were breathing." "Black and books, and books and Black -- they went together 
like Black and tennis." Justice William O. Douglas and "Black had a truly 
brotherly relationship (if one hiccuped, the other would practically say 
'excuse me')." "Life at the Court is like a turtle -- it moves slowly and 
quietly." 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy of Newman's botched behemoth is that it smothers three wonderful, 
important stories. The first is a portrait of Black the populist. Hyperactive 
and opportunistic, sarcastic, self-righteous and sentimental, he was a people's 
lawyer who made his mark representing workers in personal injury suits against 
big corporations. His ambition alone was a force to be reckoned with and, 
igniting his talent, made him a player in every arena he entered. Even on the 
Supreme Court, he entertained the notion of running for president. 
</P>
<P>
 The next is the transformation of Black into a Supreme Court titan through an 
accident of fate, strong will and combat with a series of outstanding justices. 
Because of his advocacy of Roosevelt's plan to pack the Supreme Court, Black 
was picked after the expected nominee dropped dead. He turned himself from a 
dismal draftsman whose early opinions raised questions about his fitness for 
the job ("They're not even acceptable by law school standards," Justice Harlan 
Stone commented) into an eloquent writer. He triumphed in famous feuds about 
legal ideas, notably with Justices Robert Jackson and Felix Frankfurter. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally comes the tale of Black's jurisprudence, which makes clear how any 
justice's legal ideas are heavily shaped by history. Black came to the court 
when it was dominated by conservatives who stymied Roosevelt's program of 
recovery from the Great Depression. They did so by striking down New Deal laws 
that Black favored as a senator. To buttress his belief in limited judicial 
review, he developed the idea that the court should enforce only the plain 
meaning of the Constitution. Until the end of his life, when his decisions 
become cranky, Black often read that document expansively. Today, however, when 
conservatives speak about retrenchment in constitutional law -- about 
correcting liberal mistakes of the Warren and Burger courts for which Black 
laid the groundwork -- they use language similar to his to reach the opposite 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention, Hollywood readers: A patient, resourceful writer will find in 
Newman's research the makings of a sweeping, eye-opening movie about an 
American original. Hugo Black contains the raw material for a dramatic, 
affecting and insightful work: from Black's attendance at court sessions in his 
hometown beginning at the age 6, to his role as a Ku Klux Klan officer 
initiating new members of his Klavern; from his refusal to acknowledge his 
first wife's suicide after years of depression, to his daily injection of 
himself with testosterone after he married his secretary when he was 71 and she 
was 49; and from his naive start on the court when he met most of his 
colleagues in the robing room before first taking the bench, to his vain quest 
to break the record for longevity as a justice, which led him to end his tenure 
as a fulminating has-been. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, in Gerald Gunther's fine biography of Learned Hand, readers have 
been blessed with an example of a thoroughly researched work that shows what 
can be done with similar riches. It explains the judge's writings in the 
context of his life and offers an animated profile drawing on all relevant 
personal, political and legal history. The Gunther volume underscores what 
Newman's lacks. "Hugo Black" is a biography waiting to be released from the 
curse of comprehensiveness.

POP IN A KIRK

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After watching Kirk Douglas in "Take Me Home Again," you may want to check out 
some of his classic films currently available on home video: 
</P>
<P>
 Champion (1949; Republic Home Video): Mark Robson directed this hard-hitting 
drama about an unscrupulous boxer who pulls no punches on his way to the top. 
Douglas received his first Oscar nomination for his unsympathetic portrait of 
the nasty pugilist. Marilyn Maxwell, Ruth Roman and Arthur Kennedy also star. 
Beware this colorized version also. 
</P>
<P>
 A Letter to Three Wives (1949; FoxVideo): One of Douglas' few comedic films. 
Joseph Mankiewicz wrote and directed this delightful Oscar-winning comedy about 
a town flirt who writes a letter to three women stating she's off with one of 
their husbands. But which one? Jeanne Crain, Ann Sothern and Linda Darnell play 
the suspecting wives. Douglas, Paul Douglas and Jeffrey Lynn are the possibly 
errant husbands. Celeste Holm supplies the voice of the flirt, Addie Ross. A 
real delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Man With a Horn (1950; Warner Home Video): Michael Curtiz directed this 
excellent drama with music inspired by horn player Bix Beiderbecke's turbulent 
life. Douglas is terrific as a trumpet player obsessed with hitting the perfect 
note. Lauren Bacall is the bad girl with whom he becomes involved; Doris Day is 
the good girl who tries to save him. Juano Hernandez also excels as Douglas' 
mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad and the Beautiful (1952; MGM/UA): One of the best Hollywood-produced 
films about Hollywood. Vincente Minnelli directed this Oscar winner about an 
ambitious Hollywood producer (Douglas) and his relationships with an actress 
(Lana Turner), a writer (Dick Powell) and a director (Barry Sullivan). Douglas 
received his second best actor nomination for his mesmerizing turn, but lost 
the Academy Award to Gary Cooper for "High Noon." Great David Raksin score. 
Beware the colorized version. 
</P>
<P>
 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954; Walt Disney Home Video): Walt Disney's 
first live-action feature, released 40 years ago this month, is still a lot of 
fun. Douglas seems to be having a whale of a good time in the lively adaptation 
of the Jules Verne novel. He plays an effervescent sailor who encounters the 
power-mad Captain Nemo (James Mason) and his futuristic sub, the Nautilus. The 
climactic showdown with the giant squid is one of the film's highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Lust for Life (1956; MGM/UA): Douglas received his third Oscar nomination for 
his anguished portrayal of the tormented painter Vincent Van Gogh in director 
Vincente Minnelli's bio-pic. Anthony Quinn won best supporting actor for his 
colorful role as Van Gogh's friend, the painter Paul Gauguin. 
</P>
<P>
 Paths of Glory (1957; MGM/UA Home Video): Douglas produced and stars in this 
searing anti-war film that boosted the career of up-and-coming director Stanley 
Kubrick. Set during World War I, the haunting drama deals with a French general 
(George Macready) who sends his troops on a futile mission against the Germans. 
When they fail, he picks three soldiers to be tried and executed for cowardice. 
Douglas plays Colonel Dax, a lawyer before the war, who is now the commander of 
the battle-fatigued regiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957; Paramount Home Video): Douglas and the late 
Burt Lancaster made several films together. And this John Sturges Western about 
Wyatt Earp and pal Doc Holliday's legendary showdown with the Clanton gang is 
their best. Douglas and Lancaster are a perfect fit as the dying Holliday and 
the upstanding lawman Earp. Look for a young Dennis Hopper in a supporting 
role. Frankie Laine warbles the title tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Spartacus (1960; MCA/Universal): Three years after "Paths of Glory," Douglas 
and Kubrick teamed up for this lavish spectacle about the rebellious slave who 
led the revolt for freedom against the Roman Empire. Douglas is perfectly cast 
as the brave, honorable Spartacus and he's equally matched by Jean Simmons, 
Laurence Olivier and Peter Ustinov (who won a best supporting actor Oscar). Be 
sure to watch the beautiful 1991 restored version. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonely Are the Brave (1962; MCA/Universal): This modern-day Western is one of 
Douglas' personal favorites. Dalton Trumbo wrote the script of the drama, which 
finds Douglas playing a rebellious cowboy on the lam. Douglas gives a finely 
etched portrait of a man caught in the modern world but clinging to the past. 
Walter Matthau and Gena Rowlands also star. SUSAN KING

 Finally, there is an intelligent show for teen-agers, I don't have much time 
to watch TV, but I make time for "My So-Called Life" (ABC) on Thursdays.This 
show addresses adolescent issues with sensitivity and realism, unlike other 
well-established shows ("Full House," etc.). I hope the ABC producers keep the 
show on long enough to attract the attention it deserves.

 LOST MOON: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by Jim Lovell & Jeffrey Kluger 
(Houghton Mifflin: $22.95; 378 pp.) You want an adventure? Here's an adventure. 
About the guys who didn't get to walk on the moon -- guys with preternatural 
cool and the courage of heroes. Concomitantly, about the legions of brainy, 
high-tech computer nerds who helped them get back to God's Green Footstool. 
Here are commander Jim Lovell and lunar-module pilot Fred Haise and 
command-module skipper Jack Swigert, bopping about in space 200,000 miles from 
the planet, 50,000 from the moon and something goes bump in the night. Never 
mind the moon landing. Of a sudden, there is not enough power, not enough 
water, not enough oxygen to get them back to earth! And even if they do manage, 
somehow, to reach the home atmosphere in a thoroughly disabled spacecraft, how 
will they be able to fire what's left of their thrusters at the requisite power 
and duration? A couple of degrees either way -- a couple of microseconds, 
really -- and they will either incinerate or skip off the atmosphere into 
eternal orbit around the sun, a sorry monument to man's chutzpah. This is no 
"Space for Kids." This is an adult book, written by and for adults. Jim Lovell 
once again exercises superb judgment in choosing as collaborator journalist 
Jeffrey Kluger, who sets precisely the right tone: men in mortal danger without 
a clue on what has fractured their life-supporting cocoon (a contractor 
screw-up, it turns out), refusing to panic, knowing that their only savior is 
dispassion.The narrative gets technical at times, but with the authors' skill 
and reader's application, one can follow each maneuver with all the trepidation 
of the prinipals. Just enough personal touches -- the ordeal of Lovell's 
family, the excruciating disappointment of circling the moon but never touching 
it -- complete a drama skillfully chronicled.

 ELLA FITZGERALD by Stuart Nicholson (Scribner's: $23; 334 pp.) The first 
record I ever bought -- thick, solid 78 -- was by Ella Fitzgerald with Louis 
Jordan: "Stone Cold Dead in de Market (I Kill Nobody But Me Husban')."It had a 
swing to it, a snap and a pop, a big, broad smile. It was calypso, of course, 
but Ella could do it all. Probably still can. Jazz, disco, scat (Lord, could 
she scat!), standards, bop, chantoosie, blues -- maybe not too good on blues; 
her sound was too literal, too . . . happy. Fitzgerald herself preferred 
ballads, but as I say, she could do it all. Stuart Nicholson reinforces the 
notion with as complete a biography as we're likely to get, too complete, 
maybe, for the casual connoisseur; where she sang, with whom, what she wore, 
what she ate, even a 65-page "discography" of every record the lady ever cut. 
But the essential Ella -- the straight-ahead joy, the tone and diction and 
rhythmic imagination; her ingenuousness, her "simple, optimistic values" -- 
shines through. Her past remains blurry; she wants it that way, and refuses 
interviews on the subject. Nicholson has dug deep, however, and traces an 
unremarkable Yonkers childhood to the streets of Harlem, where Fitzgerald 
survived, barely ("She was scuffling," a friend recalls, "and didn't have no 
place to go.") Then, "big, gawky, self-conscious, plain," she inched her way 
into a crowded filed through force of will and a voice that made audiences 
forget she was less than Aphrodite. It was simple, really: "Music comes out 
her," says pianist Jimmy Rowles. "When she walks down the street, she leaves 
notes."

 RAT by Andrzej Zaniewski, translated from Polish by Ewa Hryneiwicz-Yarbrough 
(Arcade $19.95; 176 pp.) They are loathsome, miasmal things, ranking down there 
with roaches, asps, journalists.Patricidal, matricidal, fratricidal, even 
homicidal, they live in sewers, spread disease, glory in slime, revel in 
raunch. And dammit, their teeth keep growing. But I suppose they can't help it. 
They are, after all, among God's creatures. Suppose you were born a rat? 
Andrzej Zaniewski supposes just that. Noting that rats "have found their most 
congenial living conditions among people," that come the revolution they may 
well inherit the earth, Zaniewski has done nothing less than write a rat's 
autobiography. With rare empathy, he cites Hercules, Odysseus, Niobe, Antigone 
in pointing out that "many tragedies, dramas, adventures take place around 
rats' burrows and nests." Then he gets right into it. It's a study at once 
repulsive and fascinating, a princely effort asking us to sympathize with a 
hairy little brute that copulates with its own mother, chomps on its own 
offspring, eats the brains out of live swine, savors "the warmth and taste of 
blood that hasn't set yet." Yes, but. What if you learned, as an infant, to 
fear light itself? There, where one can see, everything is against you, is out 
to kill you -- men, cats, snakes, even a brother slightly larger. Everywhere 
are traps, poisons; the slightest noise makes you retch in fright. Little 
wonder that you "learn to fear, learn to escape. Terror will increase your 
strength. Later you will learn to hate and kill." It is a gruesome tale, not 
without high drama. Our hero is born in a bakery cellar, ships out on a 
freighter, gets caught in a war, is seduced by a flute, mates, kills, eats, 
fights . . . dies. Rats!

 THE COLLECTED STORIES OF MAX BRAND edited by Robert and Jane Easton 
(University of Nebraska Press: $35; 415 pp.) Was he a hack or a pro? A pounder 
of pulp or a skilled writer whose work falls just the wrong side of literature? 
Whatever, he wrote so fast it's hard to tell; 30 million words, the equivalent 
of 530 books! Westerns, of course, whole herds of them, but also crime, 
historical romance, espionage, fantasy, stories about businessmen, about 
doctors (notably Kildare). He's still being published, an average of a book 
every three months for the last 75 years -- and he only lived to 52. He made a 
pot to money, spent it all. Ironically, what he really wanted to be was an epic 
poet, and he never was. Growing up "poor and desperate" in the San Joaquin 
Valley in the 1890s, Frederick Schiller Faust decided to publish under the 
snappier "Max Brand;" Faust was reserved for his poetry (none of which, 
unaccountably, is published here). In 1918, down to his last 50 cents in 
unforgiving Manhattan, he sold "John Ovington Returns" to the pulps for $60, 
and never looked back. "Ovington" is reprinted here -- a wistful piece with a 
touch of O. Henry about a great-grandson winning the descendant of a girl his 
ancestor had lost. "Above the Law," also 1918, Brand's first Western, is 
typically moralistic, simplistic, melodramatic. He gets better as he gets 
older. "The Wedding Guest," cryptic and evocative, is set in France (by then, 
Brand was living in Europe); "The Outcast Breed" is a predictable but effective 
early swipe at racism; "Pringle's Luck," a haunting tale of cowardice in war; 
"The Sun Stood Still," a first-rate exercise in irony.Not all are as good, "A 
writer of enormous and diverse talent," say the editors. We'll be the judge of 
that.

 NATALYA, GOD'S MESSENGER by Magda Bogin (Scribner's: $21; 275 pp.) The war's 
over. Rita knows she'll lose her job to a returning vet.An ad catches her eye: 
"Natalya, God's Messenger, retiring. Established palm-reading practice for 
sale, $200. No experience necessary." The place is a storefront on East 7th 
Street. She's intrigued. Rita dons sequined turban, sets out a crystal ball. 
Opens for business. And lo! She can read palms; she can see the past and the 
future. Just one problem: How does she tell her nice Jewish immigrant family in 
Forest Hills? Her intellectual, activist friends, members all of the Communist 
Party? And here's where Magda Bogin's first novel puts on some heft. Rita's -- 
Natalya II's -- chiromantic aberration aside, Bogin's people are real, flawed 
and fractious: irascible mother Gittel; gentle father Chaim, who adores Gittel 
to the point where he has his beloved violin muted so he won't disturb her (for 
her part, Gittel, with undisguised scorn, calls Chaim "Thing"). Pal/lover Leo, 
brilliant, committed, who's fought with the reds in Spain, drives a cab he 
calls "La Pasionara" and who splits rather than witness Rita's "degradation;" 
friend Vera, whose paw tests out as "the first philosophical hand ever to be 
seen in New York City." There is a problem: Rita, who can read a palm across 
the room, goes nuts from overload in the subway. There is a dilemma: She 
foretells Kennedy's assassination but can she do something to forestall it? An 
intriguing tale, marred by so many tirades against capitalism, so much sympathy 
for the poor, dear Rosenbergs, that the book too often takes the form of a 
tract before regaining its legs.

 March of the Wooden Soldiers (KTLA Sunday at 8 p.m.) is the alternate title 
for the delightful 1934 Laurel and Hardy version of the Victor Herbert operetta 
"Babes in Toyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Lane's Hallelujah (KCET Sunday at 9 p.m.) is an original Christmas 
tale that premiered on PBS' "American Playhouse" a year ago. It unabashedly 
pulls out every last emotional stop, including a contemporary retelling of the 
baby Jesus set against the reality of a black urban church -- Bethlehem becomes 
a ghetto in Washington, D.C. Excessively sentimental, but only Scrooge would 
gripe about this show. 
</P>
<P>
 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (KTLA Monday at 7:30 p.m.), Richard Fleischer's 
1954 landmark movie from Jules Verne's futuristic submarine adventure, finds 
sailor Kirk Douglas and scientist Paul Lukas up against James Mason's nefarious 
Captain Nemo. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've ever been in love you know the feeling -- a word is spoken, a look 
exchanged and you suddenly think, "Who is this, anyway? And what the hell 
happened to the person I fell in love with.?" Both as a play and in this 1992 
film, Norman Rene's Prelude to a Kiss (KTTV and XETV Tuesday at 8 p.m.), takes 
that feeling to a nervy fantasy extreme, transforming a quirk of human nature 
into a delicate romantic fable that simultaneously deals with aging and 
solitude. Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan form an extremely likable comic couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta Young, appearing before the cameras for the first time in 23 years, is 
the reason for watching the 1986 TV-movie Christmas Eve (KCAL Saturday at 6 
p.m.), which is like a '40s film made on the studio assembly line -- hokey and 
melodramatic and wanting nothing more than to leave viewers sobbing into their 
hankies. With Young, it works. She plays a feisty rich woman in Manhattan whose 
liberal notions put her forever at odds with her conservative, coldhearted son 
(Arthur Hill), who runs the corporation her late husband left them. Diagnosed 
with an inoperable aneurysm, she hires a private eye (Ron Leibman) to track 
down her three estranged grandchildren.

<P>
 NOW by Lauren Bacall (Alfred A. Knopf: $23; 214 pp.) Lauren Bacall's tongue, 
one strongly suspects, is not entirely in her cheek when she writes, "It isn't 
easy for me to face the fact that other people, even my friends, are much more 
interested in their own lives than they are in mine." It is a revealing bit of 
business, much more so than intended, for this is an irritating book; 
inconsistent, platitudinous, gratingly self-centered. Unlike the rest of us, 
Bacall does not have a dog, she has a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, as she 
tells us over and over. She does not have friends, she has "my great, great 
friends" and "my most cherished friends" and "my dearest friends." She does not 
have children, she has "my most darling son Sam" and Steve, "my cherished 
firstborn" and Leslie, "very smart, very beautiful" -- "though I still can't 
believe they don't think as I do." Bacall herself is an ideal Mom, "the most 
modern of mothers." "I haven't weighed (daughter Leslie) down with my life 
problems -- that's not my style," Bacall toots on Page 61. ("Leslie's the one I 
have unloaded on. . . . I apologize to you publicly," Page 74. Oops.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bacall's 65 now, 15 years older than when she wrote her first autobiography, 
"By Myself." In the interim she has seen cherished friends die: John Huston, 
Slim Hawks, Laurence Olivier, her dog -- sorry, her Cavalier King Charles 
spaniel. The deaths are described, interspersed among some real insights into 
life in the theater, on the road. Her own life goes on, though she wonders, 
"Will dissatisfaction -- restlessness -- insecurity never cease?" Then again, 
"No one ever said life was easy." In candor, she confides that she is looking 
for a man, for more juicy roles. One hopes she finds both. She probably will. 
After all, she's "persistent," she's "talented." Just ask her.

HIGHWAY 80, BY DONALD RAWLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was thirteen in a desert 
</P>
<P>
 best left alone, 
</P>
<P>
 dry brown as a liver spot 
</P>
<P>
 on a truck driver's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackened, rubbed clouds stood 
</P>
<P>
 against fire eaten hills 
</P>
<P>
 like a lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Their sunset edges 
</P>
<P>
 brushed the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother drove a baby blue 
</P>
<P>
 Cadillac with bare feet and a Coke 
</P>
<P>
 on Highway 80 to Yuma, 
</P>
<P>
 then San Diego and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Towns were strung like clay beads. 
</P>
<P>
 Aztec. Dateland. Mohawk. 
</P>
<P>
 For me their names were chants 
</P>
<P>
 I sang under the boom of jets 
</P>
<P>
 in an air solid as rain 
</P>
<P>
 after a summer of wasps. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ninety degree dawn 
</P>
<P>
 I pried moths off saguaros 
</P>
<P>
 with wings like fists. 
</P>
<P>
 I touched cracked mud shacks 
</P>
<P>
 with junk yard sinks, 
</P>
<P>
 old wood and pornography 
</P>
<P>
 half-buried in sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat made us stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Withdrawn and short tempered, 
</P>
<P>
 we ate early. 
</P>
<P>
 I clicked my boots together 
</P>
<P>
 under jukebox curtains 
</P>
<P>
 of ringtab and nickel. 
</P>
<P>
 We were small in the sky; 
</P>
<P>
 it was everywhere, torn blue 
</P>
<P>
 and yellow, changed, ancient. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew as a child knows 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't belong. 
</P>
<P>
 We were a long way from Phoenix, 
</P>
<P>
 Sonoyta and the Sea of Cortez 
</P>
<P>
 and we waited for the desert to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother was divorced a second time 
</P>
<P>
 but the desert remained mute 
</P>
<P>
 and relentless. Move on, 
</P>
<P>
 it gestured, move on 
</P>
<P>
 and grow old. 
</P>

 Whoever stars in "The Nanny" (CBS) has the most horrendous-sounding voice I 
have ever heard.The audience was laughing, so I guess it was funny, but the 
irritating, loud voice was so nauseous sounding. I sure hope someone (at CBS) 
will ask her to tone it down a bit.

 The Big Street (AMC Monday at 10:30 a.m.) is Lucille Ball's favorite among her 
movies.Here she's in the delightful Damon Runyon tale that casts her as a tough 
Manhattan nightclub singer adored by Henry Fonda's shy busboy; surprisingly, 
the denouement parallels that of "Midnight Cowboy.' Directed by Irving Reis.

 Gas Food Lodging (TMC early Tuesday at midnight), Allison Anders' 1992 film,

and also a lyrical sense of romance and mystery.

PROFILE; SHE HONESTLY LOVES LIFE; OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN EMBRACES EVERY DAY AND A 
CHRISTMAS STORY PACKAGED IN A CBS MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Olivia Newton-John is mellowing out on the white slip-covered couch in her 
Malibu living room. "This is my favorite room in the house because of the 
view," she says, gazing out the floor-to-ceiling windows at the expanse of blue 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, it's been a pretty peaceful morning for the Australian singer-actress 
who kept up a frenetic pace during the '70s and '80s with pop hits such as 
"Have You Never Been Mellow," "I Honestly Love You" and "Physical"; the movies 
"Grease" and "Two of a Kind" with another icon of the era, John Travolta, and a 
stake in the now-defunct clothing store chain Koala Blue. 
</P>
<P>
 When she awakened this sunny day, she went out on the balcony with a cup of 
tea, "just looking out at the birds and the pelicans." She ate breakfast with 
9-year-old daughter Chloe. Then she took her two dogs for a walk on the beach 
below her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton-John, 46, has learned to relish these small moments in life. "I just 
kind of live in the moment and enjoy it," she says, looking comfy in a 
white-hooded sweatshirt and no makeup except for a touch of lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
 But her wisdom was hard-earned. Like the widow with two daughters she plays in 
Sunday's CBS movie "A Christmas Romance," Newton-John has been through some 
trying times. "I can relate to her loneliness. I can relate to the pain she's 
going through." 
</P>
<P>
 The last few years have been character-building, to say the least. First, 
Newton-John endured the death of her best friend's daughter, Colette, who was a 
close pal of Chloe's, to a rare children's cancer. Then Newton-John's own 
father died of cancer, and two weeks later in 1992, she found a lump in her 
breast that just didn't feel right. "I knew something was wrong." It turned out 
to be cancerous and she underwent treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Her experience with breast cancer caused her to limit her commitments. "I 
needed to do that for myself. I wasn't going to work, really, I was just going 
to relax," says Newton-John. But then a project that touched her came along. "A 
Christmas Romance" is her first acting job in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie, Newton-John's character and her daughters are snowed in their 
cabin with the cranky banker (Gregory Harrison) sent to evict them. She calls 
it a "don't judge a book by its cover" story. No surprise that the banker warms 
to her character... and love blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, her last role was also in a Christmastime TV movie, "A Mom for 
Christmas," but Newton-John says that's pure coincidence. "But they're usually 
charming stories." Now she's getting ready for her own Christmas tradition -- 
the devoted environmentalist, her husband, actor Matt Lattanzi, 35, and Chloe 
will plant a living Christmas tree outside their home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christmas spirit is not the only thing about the movie that appealed to 
Newton-John. "There's no violence, there's no sex, it's a family movie. My 
child can watch it. My child is in it," she says with a big laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in her acting debut, third-grader Chloe Lattanzi stars as one of her 
mother's daughters. It was Newton-John's manager who suggested Chloe for the 
role. "I hadn't even thought of it," says Mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so proud of her. It was wonderful to see her blossom as an actress," 
Newton-John says of working with her daughter. "But it was also very difficult 
because I had to divide myself from being the mother and being the actress." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, she's a less stressed-out mom who is very close to her 
daughter. "We do everything together." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Chloe and her mom have had singing sessions on their white baby grand 
piano. "She has a nice little voice," Newton-John says. Every so often, Chloe's 
lilting voice wafts into the room from upstairs where she's recuperating from a 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton-John recalls a difficult time as a parent. She decided not to tell 
Chloe when she was battling cancer and chemotherapy. "She had lost her best 
friend to cancer. I knew that if I told her, she'd think I was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 But after it was all over, someone else told Chloe. "She came running home and 
said, 'Is it true?' I told her it was, and I promised her from then on I'd 
always tell her everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The news of her breast cancer hit Newton-John equally hard when she first 
heard it. "How do you think I felt?" 
</P>
<P>
 Newton-John's group of close friends helped her through the ordeal -- 
particularly her best friend, Nancy Chuda, Colette's mother. Husband Lattanzi 
was also enormously supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 Colette's disease and Newton-John's own cancer inspired her and Lattanzi to 
build a completely environmentally sound home with the help of architect Jim 
Chuda, Colette's father. It's all natural wood and nontoxic materials: "It's a 
healthy house." Newton-John divides her time between her Malibu home and her 
avocado farm in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton-John hopes to become a role model for women with breast cancer. She had 
planned to write a book about it, but an album came out instead. She calls 
"Gaia: One Woman's Journey," which just went gold in Australia, intensely 
personal. "It was definitely cathartic." She's waiting for a distribution deal 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that she's resurfaced with the TV movie and the album, Newton-John isn't 
worried about being pegged as a throwback to the '70s or '80s. "I don't think 
of myself that way. I think of myself as me, Olivia Newton-John. I know who I 
am. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you've faced your greatest fears, life somehow doesn't seem as 
threatening," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, she spots a spider crawling on the couch. No squasher, she. She 
scoops it up and brings it outside to the balcony. She looks around. "What a 
perfect day," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Christmas Romance" airs Sunday on CBS at 9 p.m.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; FOX'S 'RIMBA'S ISLAND' IS A PLACE 
WHERE THE ANIMALS CAN TALK TO US 
</P>

 Preschool power! 
</P>
<P>
 Programming directed to television's tiniest viewers fills blocks of time on 
several networks, including the Nick Jr. lineup, PBS and Fox's Cub House. Fox's 
fare includes the live-action Rimba's Island, which features costumed colorful 
animals with an international flair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd describe the show as a multicultural, pro-social emotional show for 
preschoolers 2 to 6," says co-executive producer Janice Sonski. The gang 
includes leader Rimba, a multicolored gorilla who sings and dances; clumsy 
Pria, an elephant who loves physical challenges; know-it-all Ilana, a giraffe; 
always-hungry Bakari, a sports-minded crocodile; funny Ookii, who's scared of 
his own shadow, and frisky lion cub Paquito, who wants to be included in 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the animals -- except Rimba, who is older -- represents a different 
preschool age that corresponds to the ages of the show's young viewers. "The 
behaviors are very different and representative of the age," says Sonski. 
</P>
<P>
 Each show mixes culture via story, song and dance. Authentic instruments, 
culled from around the world, demonstrate different musical styles with 
international flair. Three new songs are introduced with each show. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonski believes "Rimba's Island" is the first show where all episodes have 
been reviewed and approved by the National Education Assn. and the national 
Parent-Teacher Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deal with the issues preschoolers encounter," she emphasizes. "Things like 
what small children feel, being the smallest in a group, feeling left out, 
taking things without asking, breaking something that isn't yours, being a 
tattletale . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Story lines, she says, follow a strong code of ethics and always reflect 
positive and interpersonal values and self-esteem. They foster cooperative 
behavior, care, bonding, sharing behaviors and promoting empathy. "These are 
essential for preschoolers," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rimba's Island" airs on the Fox Cub House block Wednesday at 2 p.m. on KTTV. 
For ages 2 to 6. More Family Fare 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial-less children's programming isn't reserved for just PBS and pay 
cable anymore: Lifetime's Old MacDonald's Sing-a-Long Farm features no ad 
promotion breaks, a rarity on commercial cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies showed little kids couldn't tell the difference between the ads and 
the actual show," a spokesman for the producer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorful costumed animal characters -- Alfred Pig, Celeste Cow and Lucinda 
Chicken and a puppet, Poppycock Rooster, join Old MacDonald in educationally 
themed activities on the farm. Veterinary student Joanna helps out Old Mac with 
arts and crafts as well as storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlighting each episode is "The Magic Wishing Trough," which offers props 
for fantasy trips and the crafts segment. Also included is a "Story Time" 
segment, tailored to the theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old MacDonald's Sing-a-Long Farm" airs weekdays at 8 a.m. on Lifetime. For 
ages 2 to 6.

 POUNDING NAILS IN THE FLOOR WITH MY FOREHEAD by Eric Bogosian (Theatre 
Communications Group: $8.95; 82 pp., paperback original). In the introduction 
to the text of his most recent performance piece, Eric Bogosian sets out his 
credo: "The 'world' is no longer real and inaccessible; instead it is a surreal 
dimension from which escape is impossible. Millions think together and dream 
together. Slowly but surely, millions go mad together." He illuminates the 
creeping insanity by assuming skewed personas: a homeless man ranting on a New 
York subway car; an obnoxious show-biz wanna-be; a "recovering male" 
apologizing for his existence. The result is a sometimes funny, sometimes 
unsettling portrait of American mores.

 LINCOLN: An Illustrated Biography by Philip B. Kunhardt Jr., Philip B. 
Kunhardt III and Peter W. Kunhardt (Knopf: $30; 414 pp.). Abraham Lincoln has 
become such a revered figure that Americans forget he was not an especially 
popular president: In 1864, the Republican party considered replacing him on 
the ticket. To supplement their text, the authors have compiled an exceptional 
array of 19th-Century photographs, not only of Lincoln but other key figures of 
the era, including former slave Dred Scott and political cartoonist Thomas 
Nast. Near the end of this exceptional biography, the writers muse, "Despite 
all that is known, despite the maelstrom of Lincoln literature over the past 
century and a quarter, we still yearn to know and to ponder Lincoln's story 
anew -- to understand and to see and to wonder at the extraordinary human being 
who gave rise to the myths even within his own lifetime." At a time when 
office-holders are guided by polls, rather than principals, it's hardly 
surprising that people hunger for a vision of a leader who did what he believed 
was best for the nation, rather than personal gain.

 NORTH OF RELIANCE: A Personal Story of Living Beyond the Wilderness by Dave 
Olesen (Northword Press, Box 1360, Minocqua, Wis. 54548: $12.95; 160 pp., 
illustrated, paperback original). Olesen rejects the madness Bogosian 
celebrates for life in the wilderness near the Great Slave Lake. Unlike many 
neo-pioneers, he never romanticizes his decision or portrays himself as 
conquering nature. Instead of pitting himself against the harsh climate of 
northern Canada, Olesen strives to adapt his life to its rhythms. He writes 
about his successes and failures in spare, honest prose, in an expanded journal 
that reveals the beauty of the bleak northern forests.

 POWERS OF TEN: About the Relative Size of Things in the Universe by Philip 
Morrison, Phyllis Morrison and the Office of Charles and Ray Eames (Scientific 
American Library: $19.95; 159 pp., illustrated). A companion volume to the 
well-known film, "Powers of Ten" offers a graphic vision of the limits of human 
perception.Beginning with a photograph of a couple picnicking in a Chicago 
park, the authors take the reader on a journey through both the macro- and 
micro-cosmic. Expanding the image from 10 meters on a side to 10 to the 25th, 
or 1 billion light years on a side, extends it to the limits of the known 
universe. Shrinking it to 10 the -16m, about .1 fermi on a side, enters the 
realm of sub-atomic particles. This exceptional visual resource offers teachers 
and parents an easy way to demonstrate the relative scale of human existence.

 VICTORIA by Knut Hamsun, translated from the Norwegian by Oliver Stallbrass 
(Sun & Moon Press: $10.95; 155 pp.) . Long out of print, this intimate 
depiction of an ill-starred romance contrasts sharply with the Nobel Prize 
winner's epic, "Growth of the Soil." Johannes, the son of a miller, becomes a 
celebrated writer, but his literary success can't remove the stigma of his 
humble birth. He yearns for Victoria, the daughter of a local nobleman, who is 
also a prisoner of her class: Her happiness is sacrificed to the financial 
needs of her aristocratic family. Hamsun examines each character in this 
bittersweet puppet show, shakes his head at their follies, then allows them to 
crumple back into the toy box.

 WATCH IT MADE IN THE U.S.A.: A Visitor's Guide to the Companies That Make Your 
Favorite Products by Bruce Brumberg and Karen Axelrod (John Muir Publications: 
$16.95; 295 pp., illustrated, paperback original). Brumberg and Axelrod have 
compiled a list of companies that offer tours of their factories, either for 
free or at a nominal charge.Visitors can see ice cream being made (Ben & 
Jerry's, Vermont); glass being blown (Corning Glass Center, New York); bourbon 
distilled (Wild Turkey, Kentucky); chips being fried (Frito-Lay, Washington) 
and Hostess Twinkies being filled (Continental Bakery, Massachusetts). In 
places, the upbeat text reads a little too much like a press release, but 
people looking for unusual stops on their next vacation should consult "Watch 
It Made."

 THE BABY TRAIN AND OTHER LUSTY URBAN LEGENDS by Jan Harold Brunvand (Norton: 
$9.98; 367 pp.) . In his fifth collection of columns, professor of folklore Jan 
Brunvand examines the latest bizarre occurrences that supposedly happened to an 
FOAF ("friend of a friend"). The stories range from coating CDs with a green 
marker to improve the sound to the one about the man who tied up his naked wife 
and donned a super-hero costume to "rescue" her, but knocked himself 
unconscious during the preparations -- leaving her to call 911. Brunvaln traces 
the origins of these stories and offers parallel accounts from other countries, 
once again proving that fiction is stranger than truth.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: IS THERE A MYSTERY-SOLVING GRANDMOTHER IN YOUR FAMILY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KRULL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grandmothers, writes distinguished African-American poet Nikki Giovanni, "are 
a lot like spinach or asparagus or brussels sprouts: something good for us that 
we appreciate much more in reflection than in actuality." 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage grandchildren in appreciating these figures of wisdom and immense 
influence now rather than later, Giovanni has edited an unusual anthology, 
GRAND MOTHERS: Poems, Reminiscences, and Short Stories About the Keepers of Our 
Traditions (Holt: $15.95, ages 11 and up). Writers such as Gwendolyn Brooks, 
Maxine Hong Kingston, Gloria Naylor and many lesser-known names contribute 
descriptions of grandmothers who range from tender to formidable. As the 
baby-boom bulge ages into grandparent-hood, relationships between kids and 
their elders will become increasingly vital. This volume, full of revelations 
for all ages, would make an especially elegant gift from a child to his or her 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at families from a younger child's perspective is the aim of ONE 
HUNDRED IS A FAMILY (Hyperion: $13.95, ages 4 to 8). Leucadia author Pam Munoz 
Ryan enumerates from one to 10, then by tens to 100, to depict the elasticity 
of contemporary family life. It's a clever counting book as well as a 
not-too-preachy celebration of diversity. Busy, expressive illustrations by 
Benrei Huang aid in keeping the tone light. Don't worry -- the higher numbers 
don't reflect mothers with 80 or 90 children, but rather neighborhoods, 
communities, reunions and groups united by common causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time your children complain about their chores, pull out KIDS AT WORK: 
Lewis Hine and the Crusade Against Child Labor, a devastating expose of the 
exploitation of young children as cheap labor earlier in this century (Clarion: 
$16.95, ages 12 and up). Newbery-Award-winning nonfiction author Russell 
Freedman accomplishes several goals simultaneously here -- this works as a 
biography of Hine (the photographer whose work convinced American lawmakers to 
make child labor illegal), a sometimes shocking history of the employment of 
children in the United States, a description of what it took to reform child 
labor laws and last but not least -- with its striking black-and-white 
photographs by Hine -- a handsome coffee-table book. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, for the perfect gift for a child in your family who's into Nancy Drew 
or the Hardy Boys (or even for a grandmother who appreciates Sue Grafton or 
Dick Francis), buy a copy of DETECTIVE DICTIONARY: A Handbook for Aspiring 
Sleuths (from Lerner Publication's new "Late-Night Library" series, $13.95, 
ages 10 and up). From A to Z, author Erich Ballinger has the scoop, from "where 
the heck is Scotland Yard?" and "what is the Mafia, really?" to the Seven 
Golden Questions that experienced detectives ask about a crime, as well as just 
about everything you can stomach about blood, autopsies and homicide 
classifications. Wickedly irresistible, with something new for everyone.

THE AGE OF AMERICAN INVENTIVENESS; HOW OUR FIRST OPERATIONAL JET FIGHTER WAS 
BORN; SKUNK WORKS: A PERSONAL MEMOIR OF MY YEARS AT LOCKHEED, BY BEN R. RICH 
AND LEO JANOS (LITTLE, BROWN: $24.95; 350 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence S. Dietz, Lawrence S Dietz's book, The Creation of Paradise, about 
the Chandler family and the history of Los Angeles, will be published by Times 
Books/Random House. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To hear Ben Rich tell it, in his thoroughly engrossing memoir, Libya's Moammar 
Kaddafi is alive today only because Reagan's Secretary of Defense, Caspar 
Weinberger, decided, at the last minute, not to use Lockheed's Stealth F-117A 
aircraft on the April, 1986, bombing raid against Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy fighter-bombers that did make the attack were picked up by Libyan 
radar, and had to evade missiles and flak, so that their bombs, aimed at 
Kaddafi's quarters, missed their target. The F-117A, writes Rich, "would have 
attacked with surprise and placed that smart bomb right on the guy's pillow." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberger is quoted in the book explaining this bit of curiously benign 
realpolitik , in which the American government decides to assassinate the head 
of another government, but chooses not to use its best weapon. He "didn't want 
to risk having a plane go down and having its technology explored." That is, he 
didn't want the Soviet Union to figure out a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Fat chance. Rich was running the fabled Skunk Works at Lockheed, and his 
engineers had done their job perfectly: They had produced an aircraft that 
would show up on radar screens, in the words of the man who created the plane's 
design, "as big as an eagle's eyeball ." An air defense missile can't hit what 
its radar control can't see. 
</P>
<P>
 The proof of the F-117A's abilities had to wait five years after the Tripoli 
raid, when the planes were sent to attack Baghdad as part of Operation Desert 
Storm. On the first night alone, undetected by ground radar, they knocked out 
the Iraqi communication and missile centers, air defense center, and the 
country's operational commands. Iraq's fate was sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not only the story of the creation of one aircraft, as fascinating as 
that tale is. Rich, with the aid of veteran co-author Leo Janos, tells the 
history of the Skunk Works, created by Lockheed at the end of World War II to 
come up with America's first operational jet fighter. (It got its name because 
it was first housed in a tent on the Lockheed operation in Burbank, near a 
plastics factory which, in those pre-AQMD days, emitted a noxious odor that had 
the effect of discouraging curious visitors.) 
</P>
<P>
 The man who headed the operation was Clarence "Kelly" Johnson, famous in 
aviation circles for the design for the Electra and Super Constellation 
commercial airliners, as well as the P-38 Lightning during WWII. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was crusty, profane, demanding and instinctively brilliant about 
aviation design. His team gave the country the F-80, and, over the years, the 
U-2 spy plane, as well as the SR-71, which was taken out of service in 1990, 
after 24 years overflying the former Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, North Korea 
and other hostile countries where over a hundred SAM missiles were fired at it 
-- and not one plane was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich was not as distinctive (or polarizing) a personality as Johnson, nor was 
he as intuitively brilliant about aeronautics (although as a young engineer he 
did win a patent for a wire that would heat the urine elimination tubes on Navy 
patrol planes, thereby solving a particularly painful sticking problem). 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson led by sheer force of personality, and coined a slogan for the Skunk 
Works: "Be quick, be quiet, be on time." Rich was a more adept manager, a 
function of a low-key personality. Unlike some in aerospace, who took 
government contracts as an invitation to pad expenses, especially in the 1980s, 
when the U.S. spent around $2 trillion to build weapons, Rich followed 
Johnson's precept to keep the operation lean. Having "achieved phenomenal 
efficiency" building the Stealth fighters, "I offered to give the government 
some of the money back" but -- no surprise -- "The Air Force told me that it 
had no bookkeeping methods for taking back money, so I gave them $30 million 
worth of free engineering improvements on the airplane." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich retired from Lockheed just as his Stealth planes became the technological 
and military stars of the Gulf War. He predicts that "the Skunk Works will 
endure and remain unrivaled for advancing future technology," defining that 
future most dramatically in terms of a world abundant with bloody wars, and 
dictators no less loathsome than those in the Soviet Union merely because they 
have fewer resources with which to produce their evil mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 As almost all of the aerospace news in Southern California over the past few 
years has been about layoffs and downsizing, Rich's book is a welcome antidote, 
a reminder of the days when that industry and this region were suffused with 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has a prescription for at least some of what ails us: "We encouraged 
our people to work imaginatively, to improvise and try unconventional 
approaches to problem solving, and then got out of their way. By applying the 
most common-sense methods to develop new technologies, we saved tremendous 
amounts of time and money, while operating in an atmosphere of trust and 
cooperation both with our government customers and between our white-collar and 
blue-collar employees. In the end, Lockheed's Skunk Works demonstrated the 
awesome capabilities of American inventiveness when free to operate under near 
ideal working conditions."

AN AMERICAN'S ODYSSEY; WHAT I LIVED FOR, BY JOYCE CAROL OATES (DUTTON: $23.95; 
624 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alan Cheuse, Alan Cheuse's novel The Grandmothers' Club will be published 
this month in a new paperback edition. He is the author of a number of other 
books, and serves as book commentator for NPR's evening news-magazine All 
Things Considered. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of our greatest modern writers -- William Faulkner and Sherwood Anderson 
-- made it their business to focus on a fairly small plot of imagined national 
territory and make a world of that location. Yoknapatawpha County, Winesburg, 
Ohio -- we've lived in these places that you can't find in an atlas. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of dozens of novels and story collections, Joyce Carol Oates 
has laid claim to a slice of Upstate New York bordering on the two easternmost 
of the great lakes. In her masterly new work of novel-length fiction, "What I 
Lived For," we find ourselves in a fairly large burg in that part of the world, 
an amalgam of Buffalo and Rochester as best I can, from a distance, make it 
out, a place that Oates dubs Union City, N.Y., and portrays as a great 
cross-section of urban American life, with all of its rusting factories and 
run-down downtowns, its dilapidated poor neighborhoods and rising suburbias, 
and the jarring juxtaposition of blacks and working-class Irish and other 
tribes that come together in the strenuous dance that we call local politics 
and business. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the attention Oates pays to the details of life in the contemporary 
city -- the signs and smells and sounds and all other various sorts of detritus 
that go into the formation of our daily round in these urban pastures -- 
however accurate it is can compare to the force and vitality of the main 
character she has created to prance around on this stage. Jerome "Corky" 
Corcoran -- without him, we might as well have Eden without Adam, or, perhaps a 
better analogy, the Inferno without the damned or Purgatory without the souls 
struggling toward salvation. He is as marvelous an invention as we have 
encountered in our fiction in many years, as big as -- or maybe I ought to say 
"as bigger than life as" -- John Updike's Rabbit Angstrom, another figure in 
whom the novelist sought to create the nexus of many of the currents of 
up-to-date American experience and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-three years old, a heretofore successful entrepreneur and wheeler-dealer 
on the verge of big money problems, ex-husband of one of the city's former debs 
(and still haunted by his difficult relationship with his ex-wife's daughter 
Thalia), Corky Corcoran is a horny dynamo of a young middle-aged fellow who 
can't keep his mind off sex even as he's trying to piece his life together and 
keep liquor at arm's length. He's one of those little guys who wants men to 
look up to him and women to lie down for him and he thinks of these matters -- 
mainly respect and sex -- just about every minute of his waking day. "Do women 
suspect," Corky wonders at one point during his adventurous weekend -- Memorial 
Day weekend, 1992 -- that makes up the main time-frame of this novel. "What 
utter pigs, what filth we are. Do they have half a clue. . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Carol Oates has a pretty accurate idea of it, the inner life of a man 
who, like Joyce's Bloom, is a perfect average guy to follow around, l'homme 
moyen sensuel as they say in the law courts. After a stunning prologue in which 
we witness young Jerome's witnessing of his contractor father's murder by union 
hit-men, we meet the grown man at the beginning of the spring holiday, stuck in 
a traffic jam on his way to visit his mistress for a lunch-time matinee. What 
does he do but leap out of his car -- Cadillac Sedan de Ville, by the way -- 
and help the young cop in the middle of it direct traffic? And then he rushes 
off to make love to a wheel-chair ridden WASP judge's young wife, with whom he 
has been cavorting for the past year or so. Mastery over men, mystery over 
women -- it all comes out here at once. As does Oates' mastery over plot as 
well as male psychology. That traffic jam has been caused by a jam-up in front 
of an apartment house where a suicide has just occurred, and that death will 
cause a number of moral and psychic traffic jams in Corky's life before the 
weekend has ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates' jangly present-tense paragraphs, in which she lays on information about 
Corky's momentary desires even as she manages to put his existential passage 
into the perspective of a lifetime, take a while to get used to. And because 
Oates, as I suggested, has much more than half a clue as to how men think and 
feel, the raunch factor may put off prudes on the right and Feminist censors on 
the left. Scarcely a page goes by when Corky isn't meditating in his own 
frenetic fashion about sexual intercourse, vaginas, buttocks, breasts and his 
own penis in a vernacular that takes us back to the bawdy old pages of Henry 
Miller and, beyond that, to a place that I mentioned earlier, the mind of 
Leopold Bloom and that greatest of modern literary locations, the Dublin of 
"Ulysses." 
</P>
<P>
 What writer in her right mind would dare to compose a novel that would allow 
the reader to compare it, even for a fleeting moment, to that masterwork of the 
genre? Only the audacious, pugnacious and triumphant Joyce Carol Oates. She's 
pushed her art to the limits here and shown us, to paraphrase old Hemingway, 
that she can go a few rounds with the champion of us all.

GETTING A GRIP ON MOM; LILIANE: RESURRECTION OF THE DAUGHTER, BY NTOZAKE SHANGE 
(ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $18.95; 292 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kelly Cherry, Kelly Cherry is a poet, fiction writer and essayist whose 
books include My Life and Dr. Joyce Brothers, a novel in stories. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ntozake Shange, a multitalented writer best known for her play, "for colored 
girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf," and the novel, 
"Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo," in her third novel offers a daring portrait of 
a black woman artist re-creating herself out of social and psychological chaos, 
the fragmentation that haunts our time, our nation. Ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Liliane is undergoing a traditional psychoanalysis. Brief dialogues headed 
"Room in the Dark" preface the more novelistic chapters, allowing us to 
eavesdrop on therapeutic sessions in which Liliane pursues a deeper 
understanding of her anxieties and anger, a fuller understanding of her feeling 
for her parents. Her task is to learn to listen to herself. As her analyst says 
about the panic Liliane feels as she tries to do this, "It's not really the 
silence you believe you can't survive. It's the noise in your head that you 
only hear in silence." 
</P>
<P>
 Daughter of Judge Parnell Lincoln, a powerful man who "kept score," and S. 
(for Sunday) Bliss LaFontaine Lincoln, who left the Judge to run off with a 
white man, Liliane is burdened by grievances she will learn to acknowledge and 
deal with, but as the book opens she is still finding her way in the world: "I 
travel a lot. I look at men and take some home or leave the country, borders 
have never intimidated me. My passport is in order and I carry letters of 
credit, perfume, four fancy dresses and six nightgowns. . . . I paint." She 
believes in "honor, color, and good sex." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot of sex in this book, but there is also a love of language. 
Liliane describes what she sees and feels when she paints: "Women wrapped in 
blue-black swishes of spun cotton float through the streets. . . . I am 
allowing my fingers to float as the women do, over the cobblestones, reddened 
dirt paths, billows of dust following donkeys, mules, bicycles." 
</P>
<P>
 In the narrative chapters, language is often presented in monologues, voices 
inflected and rising off the page to reach the reader's ear as well as eye. One 
may think of these chapters as soliloquies, even, for there is an interesting 
theatricality to the book's structure, as if it could be dismantled and 
reassembled, like a series of stage sets. Roxie, Lollie, Bernadette -- friends 
of Liliane from childhood -- speak in turn, as do some of the lovers, each 
individuated voice giving us another "view" of Liliane but also enlarging the 
novel's historical reach, taking us from the North to the South and back again. 
Yet it is Liliane who is at the center and holds our attention, as she embodies 
and makes personal a universal struggle to overcome divisive hatreds, become 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "White folks got us so tangled up and wound round ourselves we can't live 
without them or the idea where we can touch it. If we live like white folks 
don't exist, like they don't matter, they kill us. . . . If we act decent, they 
treat us like fools. If we spend our lives hating them, we look as foolish and 
psychotic as they do to the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Why, she wants to know, did her mother leave her -- for it was not only her 
father who was left -- and how could she have left her for a white man? As 
Liliane sees it, "She walks out the door, leaves me behind, goes off with her 
lover to start a new life, and I have to live with her over and over again, 
because all I had was memories. I had memories and pictures. Memories and 
stories I'd tell sometimes. That's all I had." Liliane's healing takes place as 
she begins to understand the limited choices her mother had and that those 
choices need not determine hers. 
</P>
<P>
 A final soliloquy by another friend, Victor-Jesus, a photographer, provides a 
kind of dream-resurrection, a semi-surrealistic chapter in which all the 
characters, even Liliane's "dead beau" Sawyer and Sawyer's fragile, tenuously 
surviving sister Hyacinthe, even poor murdered Roxie -- as Liliane says, "Our 
friends, our ghosts, and the gods we love" -- appear in the pictures he takes 
of Lollie's wedding. Lollie is marrying one of Liliane's ex-boyfriends, but 
Liliane, happy for them, is there. Reunited in joy with family and friends, 
Sunday Bliss' daughter, following her journey through history and self, has 
returned to a new life, or the old life newly cherished. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Liliane," Shange has written a novel that manages to be both risky and 
stylish. It moves fast and carries the reader into areas of sensibility not 
always entered. Of "memories and pictures," "memories and stories," she has 
made a novel that takes its place on the shelf -- by now, shelves -- of 
exciting fiction by contemporary black writers.

DAYTIME AND MOTHERHOOD ARE A BALANCING ACT FOR MAEVE KINKEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a working mother, Maeve Kinkead, who plays Vanessa Lewis on "Guiding 
Light," believes she knows of which she speaks: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is possible to feel comfortable as a working mom. There is 
always more you feel you should do. And, I'm sorry, but it is easier for men 
and always will be. Especially in the early years, children have a stronger 
bond to their mothers than they do to their fathers." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Kinkead took a year off -- she has been with the show for 14 years -- 
to spend more time with her husband, Harry Streep, and children, Abraham, 13, 
and Maud, 10. But her love of acting called her back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst," she says, "is when both kids whine or beg me not to go to work. 
But part of growing up is in realizing you have to compromise. You also realize 
that when you're in a bad patch, things will get better -- especially if you 
have a good partner, and I do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the kids were young, we've always told them what was going to happen 
that day," she says. "We haven't been able to follow the standard advice of 
giving the kids a stable schedule, but this way they know what is going on, and 
I try to let them call the shots when we're together -- to do what they want to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Her children were raised with a sense of independence. When Abraham graduated 
from elementary school, he choose public over private school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great little guy," Kinkead says with pride. "He thinks about things 
very carefully, and he had real reasons -- especially wanting to be in a big 
diversified class. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the public school system is in dreadful shape," says Kinkead, who 
graduated from Radcliffe University with the intention of becoming an English 
teacher. Her husband Harry currently teaches history and dance in New York 
City. "Abraham is doing well at school, but for high school we're hoping to 
find a private school that has the qualities he wants too. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinkead's one wish is "that every child get a decent -- not even good, just 
decent -- education. There is a big parents' movement in our little village. 
We're trying to do something about it, but unfortunately it won't be soon 
enough to help my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham and Bryan Buffinton, who plays Kinkead's on-screen son, Bill, are 
close in age. "My son is in awe of Bryan, who is older and taller. It was so 
cute last year when Bryan selected one of my son's Christmas gifts. He told me 
what was good music, but he also told me which ones didn't have many bad 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinkead and her family watch little television at home, and her kids rarely 
see her as Vanessa. And she would never allow them to see her current story 
line with her young lover Matt Reardon, played by Kurt McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," she says, "I love it. It's my favorite story in years. Although the 
custody battle was very intense, it was not only emotionally draining to play, 
but it was narrower in gauge. This is a story in which everything about Vanessa 
has changed. Something in Vanessa had died. Now her spirit is waking again." 
</P>
<P>
 Most fans have responded positively to the story line. Some worry that Vanessa 
will be hurt, while others, who don't remember Vanessa's wild past, do not like 
to see an icon tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have had letters that have made me weep from widows who replay my 
scenes as hope that one day they too might feel alive again." 
</P>
<P>
 Today she is amazed when people recognize her in the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have my glasses on and no makeup," she says. "I'm a 'Guiding Light,' 
couturier's nightmare -- everything I have is ripped. So when someone says, 
'Hi, Vanessa,' I wonder how I'm recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guiding Light" airs weekdays at 2 p.m. on CBS.

A QUESTION OF LIFESTYLE; FOND MEMORIES OF MY OLD ROOMMATE, STEWART BRAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Krassner, Paul Krassner's autobiography, Confessions of a Raving, 
Unconfined Nut: Misadventures in the Counter-Culture, has just been published 
in paperback by Simon and Schuster. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When "The Whole Earth Catalog" was first published in 1968, not a single entry 
about the invasion of privacy was included. But now "The Millennium Whole Earth 
Catalog" devotes four entire pages to the ever-increasing political and 
corporate encroachments upon our privacy. What was once deemed paranoia turns 
out to have been prophesy. Nevertheless, this Catalog -- edited by Howard 
Rheingold with a global network of experts -- is a veritable Yellow Pages of 
Optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 In a foreword, founder Stewart Brand proclaims: "Here are the tools to make 
your life go better. And to make the world go better. That they're the same 
tools is our theory of civilization." Those tools range from safe sex to 
computer technology, from mushroom growing to pirate radio, from alternative 
medicine to urban ecology, from aging to computer "zines." In 25 years the 
Catalog has evolved from servicing hippie communes to establishing virtual 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, Brand invited Ken Kesey and me to co-edit "The Last Supplement to the 
Whole Earth Catalog." One day I sensed that there was something vaguely 
different about my papier-mache Donald Duck with eight arms. Then I realized -- 
he had 10 arms now. The additional two arms were actually two pairs of 
shoelaces. Kesey had bought a pair of shoelaces, but they came in packages of 
three. I learned that such pranks were his way of sharing intimacy, along with 
practical hints like pouring cornstarch into his crotch because it "works 
better than talcum powder and you don't smell like a nursery." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years later I was living in a room in the basement of a 
yellow-painted San Francisco townhouse. At the time, Brand's marriage was 
breaking up, and he moved to another room in the basement. We shared a 
bathroom. I gave him a key to my room so he could have access to the 
refrigerator, invited him to use my phone until he got his own and offered my 
king-size water bed whenever I was away. I hadn't intended for this to be bread 
cast upon the water bed, but when the townhouse was sold and everybody had to 
move out, Stewart found an apartment on Rose Street -- actual roses were 
embedded in the tar along the street -- and he agreed to let me rent a small 
room that he used as a library. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be on a trial basis," Stewart said, "as long as our lifestyles don't 
conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 I had been publishing the work of conspiracy researcher Mae Brussell in "The 
Realist" -- from the J.F.K. assassination to the Watergate break-in -- and in 
the process I had undergone a paranoid freakout from information overload. Now 
she was warning me against sharing an apartment with Stewart. "I can smell a 
rat," she said, "and for sure Stewart Brand is a government pig. Be really 
careful how much you tell him of yourself or your business. His kind can really 
hurt you in many ways. And do not put it past him. You are working in a 
dangerous area now, and certain precautions are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you saying? Am I in some kind of physical danger?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, but he'll try to psych you out." 
</P>
<P>
 I defied my conspiracy guru and took the room anyway. Three of the walls were 
lined with bookshelves that Stewart had built. One night the heaviest shelf 
collapsed with its contents falling all over my narrow cot. Had I been there, I 
might have been killed by his double-volume set of "The Ancient Art of Warfare" 
alone. On the available wall I taped a photo of my daughter, Holly, and a 
couple of posters. One was a Native American. The other was President Nixon, 
with a quote from his inaugural address: "I think of what happened to Greece 
and Rome and you see what is left -- only the pillars. What has happened, of 
course, is that great civilizations of the past, as they have become wealthy, 
as they have lost their will to live, to improve, they then have become subject 
to the decadence that eventually destroys the civilization. The United States 
is now reaching that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart and I were a touchstone of contrast. He was tall; I was short. He had 
closely-trimmed straight blond hair; I had long curly brown hair. His craggy 
features resembled a Nordic god; mine a friendly gargoyle. He wore a wristwatch 
even when he slept; I didn't wear one even when I was awake. He was neat, threw 
stuff away and kept organized filing cabinets; I was a sloppy pack rat with a 
filing cabinet that remained empty. He was carnivorous and ate meat; I was a 
vegetarian and ate meat, but only once a weak, usually his leftovers while he 
was at the Zen Center a block away. He had a strange sweet tooth. In college, 
his favorite snack was a slice of white bread with butter and sugar on it. Now 
he preferred chocolate chip yogurt and sesame-graham cookies and unbaked 
frozen-cookie dough. He occasionally smoked cigarettes and drank wine. I never 
did any legal drugs, but he turned me on to hot-buttered rum and gave me a jar 
of batter for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 We would each entertain our own guests. I would be in my room, interviewing 
Manson family member Squeaky Fromme, and he would be in his room, interviewing 
renowned anthropologist Gregory Bateson. I would share with Stewart my latest 
conspiracy theory, and he would give me a copy of Scientific American with an 
article on the mathematics of coincidence. And we inadvertently affected each 
other's sensibilities. Once I came home, looking forward to a relaxing carrot 
bubble bath, but the tub was filled with his potted plants, nourishing 
themselves on water while he was away, and I didn't have the heart to disturb 
them. Conversely, when he was driving and stopped to help a stranded motorist 
with a jump-start, he admitted that he wouldn't have done so if I hadn't been 
in the car, and recalled the time he noticed me absent-mindedly turning over 
thumbtacks on the windowsill so nobody would stick their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, however, one particularly perverse idiosyncrasy that we had in 
common. I kept my awards -- from the Feminist Party Media Workshop (for 
journalism) and from Playboy (for satire) -- buried in a desk drawer. And 
Stewart kept his -- the National Book Award for "The Last Whole Earth Catalog" 
(first prize in the contemporary affairs category) -- hidden in his closet, an 
especially ironic gesture since there was resentment in the publishing industry 
that this non-literary effort had received the highly coveted award. One of the 
three jurors on the selection panel resigned in anger. Roger Strauss, president 
of Farrar, Strauss & Giroux, complained: "Look, it's a book I would have loved 
to publish for all the obvious financial reasons, but it's a mishmash for 
coffee tables." I asked Stewart why he didn't display the plaque on his wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Um," he explained. "I've observed that when I visit people whose offices are 
adorned with awards, diplomas and photos with famous names, my opinion of them 
goes down. My National Book Award stays in the closet so I can retain 
self-respect." 
</P>
<P>
 It was as though I deliberately kept testing the boundaries of Stewart's 
declaration that the duration of our living arrangement depended on the 
non-conflicting nature of our lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been experimenting with THC, the ingredient in marijuana which gets one 
high, in powder form. On the night that the improvisational ensemble, the 
Committee, was to have its final performance, and while Walter Cronkite was 
concluding the news with his customary, "That's the way it is," I snorted all 
the THC I had left, in preparation for a personal pilgrimage to the Committee 
theater for the end of a satirical era. The last thing I remember was brushing 
my teeth, talking to Stewart and being overwhelmed by the drone of his electric 
saw. I woke up in a strange bed at 3 a.m. Since I was out at the time, here's 
his description of what happened: 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been building a bed while you stood in the hall doorway reporting the 
latest turns in your hassle with Scientology. After a prolonged peculiar 
silence, I peeked in the hall to find that you were gone, replaced by a 
vacant-eyed robot which opened and closed its mouth, made a drifty gesture with 
a tube of toothpaste and said, 'Nn. . . . Gn. . . .' Terrifying. All I could 
think was that the Scientologists must've finally zapped you. After a while the 
thing -- you -- toppled like a tree, crashed and commenced baying into my 
buffalo rug. I phoned a friendly shrink for consultation. He listed to symptoms 
-- you were by now into a howly slow-motion laugh, 'Haaaaaa haaaaaa haaaaaa 
haaaaaa' -- and the shrink suggested I take you to the UC hospital for 
evaluation. Which I did, with the aid of a couple of students from the Zen 
center. I would've put you to bed, but I thought you were having an epileptic 
fit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you stick a TV Guide in my mouth like you're supposed to?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You were doing fine with the buffalo rug." 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, I read that six members of Vietnam Veterans Against the 
War had been charged with conspiracy to use a variety of bizarre weapons, 
including fried marbles, to attack the 1972 Republican convention, and I 
immediately assumed it was a frame-up by provocateurs. Fried marbles? Of 
course! My perception of the logic of those in power was that if they accused 
the veterans of having fried marbles as a weapon, the public would think it was 
too bizarre not to be true. When I first learned that Richard Nixon's favorite 
meal was cottage cheese with ketchup, I tried that, so it was only natural that 
I would now fry me up some marbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just don't use my Teflon pan," Stewart requested. 
</P>
<P>
 I went shopping and found a place that sold marbles. I asked for the kind that 
were best for frying. The clerk laughed at what she had to believe was my idea 
of a joke. I returned home and melted butter in my saucepan. Then I fried two 
marbles. Apparently the purpose in weaponry was that when a fried marble is 
catapulted from a slingshot it will shatter upon hitting the target. The poor 
person's cluster bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul!" Stewart said in his best prissy Tony Randall voice. "You sauteed those 
marbles. A warm buttery marble is hardly an instrument of aggression. You 
should've added sliced mushrooms. At least follow the correct recipe: Deep-fry 
the marbles in fat hot enough to smoke slightly and then plunge them in cold 
water. ZZkk! Ornamental little weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 While Stewart and I were roommates, I wrote "Tongue Fu," a fable serving as an 
allegory for my conspiracy research and as a catharsis for my paranoid 
freakout, but the exorcism went into reverse when Nixon's Vice President, Spiro 
Agnew, resigned in the face of a tax scandal, Gerald Ford was appointed to 
replace him, then Nixon resigned, Ford became President, he selected Nelson 
Rockefeller as his Vice President, and for the first time in American history 
we had a pair of executives in the White House who were not elected. I had a 
slight relapse of paranoia. In keeping with the trickle-down theory of 
conspiracy, I became suspicious of Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, he had decided to publish "Tongue Fu" (with an apologia for its 
bawdiness) in "The Whole Earth Epilog," and now I managed to convince myself, 
without the slightest rational basis, that he had changed my ending. I decided 
to confront my paranoia. On an afternoon that he was staying home, I took a bus 
to Sausalito. I walked to his office-on-a-houseboat and checked out the 
galleys. Nothing had been changed. I felt silly, but I was OK again. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the apartment, I didn't mention my little journey to Stewart. But I 
sensed that there was something vaguely different in my room. Then I finally 
realized what it was -- my Richard Nixon poster. The President's eyes, which 
were usually looking toward the right, were now looking toward the left. I 
examined the poster more closely and was able to discern that the original 
eyeballs had been whited out from the right side, and new eyeballs had been 
drawn at the left-hand corners. Then I checked to see whether the eyes in 
Holly's photo had also been changed, but no, she was still looking directly at 
me. So was my Native American guide. Only Nixon's eyes had been altered. It 
seemed out of character for Stewart to have done this, but I asked him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I didn't do it," he said. "But Kesey was around for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kesey! Aha! I should've recognized the telltale trail of cornstarch."

 Frank Capra's 1937 film of the James Hilton novel remains a romantic adventure 
classic timelier than ever. Hilton's mythical Shangri-La has long been a 
synonym for an earthly paradise, a refuge from the world's ills.That its story 
is very much an expression of hope from an age of comparative innocence is why 
it works so well. Ronald Colman stars as a noted British diplomat-writer who 
supervises the evacuation of Westerners from a Chinese province in the midst of 
civil war. Taking the last plane out, they wind up not in Shanghai, their 
destination, but on a mysterious trip to the Himalayas. With Jane Wyatt and 
Ronald Colman (both pictured) and Sam Jaffe, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell, 
Margo and others (TNT early Monday at midnight).

CRITIC'S PICK: 'JACK THE BEAR' 
</P>

<P>
By Peter Rainer

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marshall Herskovitz's 1993 film of the 1972 Dan McCall novel tells the story 
of two boys, 12-year-old Jack (Robert J. Steinmiller Jr., right) and little 
brother Dylan (Miko Hughes, center), whose father (Danny DeVito, left) is the 
host of a late-night monster movie TV show. The film is essentially about how 
Jack comes to realize the real monsters in his life.In moments of stress, 
Jack's memories of his mother (Andrea Marcovici), killed in a car accident, 
haunt him. Scripted by "Schindler's List" Oscar-winner Steven Zaillian, the 
film focuses on Jack's pain without apology, and while DeVito is miscast, the 
flaw is not fatal because the the movie really belongs to Steinmiller (HBO 
Sunday at 4:15 p.m., Wednesday at 11:30 a.m.). Peter Rainer

 Robert Altman's witty and triumphant look at Hollywood opens with a bravura 
eight-minute take -- perhaps a sendup of Orson Welles' celebrated credit 
sequence of "Touch of Evil" -- which ends up in the office of a smooth but 
slimy young executive (Tim Robbins, pictured), the target of anonymous death 
threats. The film offers scads of stars playing themselves, lots of inside 
jokes and is sure to appeal to anyone who presumes to be hip to Hollywood 
(Showtime Monday at 1:05 a.m.). Kevin Thomas

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; ARYE GROSS IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO BE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND 
-- ESPECIALLY IF HER NAME IS 'ELLEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Do beards make the man? Not always. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ellen" producers thought actor Arye Gross' goatee made his character, Adam, 
"smarmy." So, off it came. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that facial hair can make a big impact on a person's 
personality," Gross says wryly, from an ABC publicist's office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross' beard was one of several changes producers made in the show this 
season. For starters, last year the series was called "These Friends of Mine." 
</P>
<P>
 When first season co-stars Holly Fulger and Maggie Wheeler were written out of 
the script, Gross worried that he might be a casualty as well. "I just had a 
feeling that was the way they were going," he says. "I didn't know what they 
were going to do with (Adam)." 
</P>
<P>
 He's glad to still be on board and pleased that the effort to develop a 
credible friendship between Adam and Ellen has been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the new additions, but I miss Holly and Maggie. They were tremendous 
actors," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Los Angeles native says he shares one thing with Adam: "Strangely 
enough, he looks exactly like me. And I think that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, 34, says he's got "a couple of years of perspective" on Adam, who 
recently celebrated his 32nd birthday on the show. After living "all over Los 
Angeles from Carthay Circle to Silver Lake," Gross recently purchased a home in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Adam moved out of Ellen's place and still struggles across the 
hallway. Gross is considerably more settled. 
</P>
<P>
 The acting bug bit him early on: "I knew as a kid. I thought it was as likely 
as becoming an astronaut. Even though I grew up in L.A., we didn't know anyone 
in this business. In L.A., you were in show business or aerospace, which my 
father was." 
</P>

 Gross' Adam, whose friendship with Ellen never strays from the platonic, is 
someone the actor thinks viewers can relate to. "A lot of people have been 
where he is. He keeps changing directions and wears his heart on his sleeve. 
He's like I'd be in that situation. He's looking to save his life and has had a 
dozen different careers since the show's start." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross pursued drama in both high school and at UC Irvine, which he parlayed 
into work at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. Theater work led to features, 
including "Soul Man," "The Opposite Sex " and "A Midnight Clear." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great to find out you can really make a living out of doing this, and 
there's no turning back for me now," he says. "I find myself wondering what I 
might do instead of this and I can never come up with anything." 
</P>
<P>
 His older siblings -- a brother who's a musician and a sister who's a painter 
-- are, by trade, a realtor and a neurologist. "My father was a scientist, but 
was also inspired in a creative way. We all have that artistic inclination. I 
just turned mine into work." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross says he wasn't specifically looking to work on a TV series, "but I 
worked with the show's producers on 'Soul Man.' When they sent the script for 
this show, I laughed out loud." A fan of series star Ellen Degeneres, he thinks 
the show is "finding itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the exposure that highly rated "Ellen" provides, Gross is no longer 
mistaken for the star of "Campus Man" (that was Cameron Dye) or one of the 
"Perfect Strangers" or Andrew McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now if people say I look familiar, I'm coy," he explains, relating a story of 
someone who asked, "Didn't we go to high school together?" When Gross 
responded, "Well, I'm an actor, actually," the response was, "No, we really 
went to high school together." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross laughs. "I'd like to avoid that possibility of being embarrassed again." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ellen" airs Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. on ABC.

 Henry Winkler is quick to say he was "thrilled," not intimidated, starring 
opposite Katharine Hepburn in the holiday movie "One Christmas," airing Monday 
on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I must tell you something," he adds with a smile, "that not being 
intimidated is a big accomplishment. I was so happy that I wasn't intimidated, 
that I wasn't awkward and I did my job. I was thrilled to death. I was so proud 
of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Winkler acknowledges, that wouldn't have been the case. "I 
was intimidated by everybody," he says matter-of-factly. "I thought everybody 
knew more than I did. I think just growing up (just changed my outlook). I just 
didn't want to be that way any more, so I worked on it. What is maddening is 
that the distance between being intimidated and giving all that power away is 
not that far away." 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler raises his hand and measures out about an inch between his thumb and 
index finger. "It is that far away," he repeats. "That's the killer." 
</P>
<P>
 On this rainy, cold morning, Winkler is relaxing in his office at Walt Disney 
Studios in Burbank. The actor, now 49, was a pop-culture phenomenon for 11 
seasons as the supercool leather-jacketed Fonzie on the ABC sitcom "Happy 
Days." In person, Winkler comes across as a genuinely nice guy, appreciative of 
the fact his visitor had seen a dress rehearsal of "Happy Days" in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Happy Days" has been out of production for 10 years, the series -- and 
the Fonz -- live on in repeats. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what amazes me, that I'm still on," Winkler says. "I get fan mail. I 
get invited to dinner in homes across the country -- by the parents of the 
children who are watching. You know, the Fonz is (mentioned) in 'Pulp Fiction.' 
Not only that, but mentioned by one of the most incredible performances to come 
down the pike -- by Samuel Jackson. I called him up, but unfortunately he was 
off doing (a movie)." 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler, who also is a successful TV and film producer ("MacGyver," 
"Sightings, "The Sure Thing") and film director ("Cop-and-a-Half," "Memories of 
Me"), had never met Hepburn before doing "One Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 The bittersweet drama, directed by Tony Bill, is based on Truman Capote's 
acclaimed short story about an 8-year-old boy named Buddy who spends Christmas 
with his estranged father. Hepburn plays a charming grand dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just admired her from afar," Winkler say of Hepburn. "She is an amazing 
person because she is 87. She is a very powerful woman. She is very powerful 
physically. We were in this big mansion on Market Street in Wilmington, N.C., 
and there was this big stairway going up to the second level where she had to 
do a scene. She climbed those stairs as if she was just walking from one chair 
to another. She has a very powerful presence and whatever time does to a human 
being at 87, it didn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler, the father of three, adored his 8-year-old co-star, T.J. Lowther ("A 
Perfect World"), who plays Buddy. "That kid is so great," he says with much 
affection. "We had a bond that you dream about when you are working with 
somebody. He was my friend. We just connected. We had a relationship and it 
just jumps off the screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler was quick to give young Lowther some sage acting advice. "I would 
explain to him that actors don't eat peanut butter before doing a scene because 
it can stick to the roof of your mouth, because it can get stuck in between 
your teeth, it can completely gum up the works. So I had to hide the sandwiches 
from him and after the scenes, he would have a snack. He is scrumptious." 
</P>
<P>
 In "One Christmas," Winkler plays a ne'er-do-well who is not doing very well 
living in the New Orleans of 1930. And he hasn't a clue how to deal with his 
son whom he hasn't seen in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an impression of who a father is supposed to be," Winkler explains. 
"The father has no ability to be a father and sees the son, in my mind, as a 
pawn -- a child is to be seen and not heard -- and to use the child to the best 
benefit. He was a man who, I think, was a manic depressive more than a drunk. I 
think he kept reaching for the brass ring and never quite got it." 
</P>
<P>
 And when Buddy arrives, Winkler says, "he is scamming, always looking for 
money. I played him as a Northerner who went South to marry older and rich -- 
charm his way into wealth. He could do it, but lived from hand to mouth and had 
no idea what it was to be intimate and no idea what it was like to be loved. 
And he certainly had no connection to this short person, his son. But he learns 
to love through his son. The son is very wise." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, Winkler says, is an emotional ride. "It gets your energy going -- 
you hate the dad, you like the dad, you hate the dad, you are outraged by the 
dad and you feel sorry for the dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler says he had to carefully "modulate" his performance. "But the director 
was very good about that because there were so many ways to go (with the 
character). My wife, who is the most direct critic, the most straightforward in 
her language about what I do, went and saw it and she gave me the 'OK.' So I 
knew I was somewhere in the vicinity of having done a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 "One Christmas" airs Monday at 9 p.m. on NBC; "Sightings" air Sundays at 6 
p.m. on KTTV; repeats of "Happy Days" air weekdays at 6 a.m. on TBS.

RETRO; HAVE YOURSELF A NOSTALGIC LITTLE CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>

<P>
 Consider "Television Christmas Classics," premiering Friday on CBS, as a big 
Christmas stocking filled with Yuletide yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by Marie Osmond, the one-hour special features more than 34 clips from 
Christmas-themed episodic series and specials that are divided into five acts: 
"Musical Moments," "Santa Claus," "More Musical Moments," "Gift Giving" and 
"White Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 "We started going through clips to see what patterns we could find and 
probably came up with about six or eight different kinds of stories in both 
drama and comedy," says executive producer Michael Hirsh. "We ended up using 
'Gift Giving' and 'Santa Claus,' but a close third was 'Bad Trees.' Bad trees 
have been a comedy staple for years apparently. Being Jewish, it was sort of a 
discovery for me. We could have done an entire act on bad trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the musical clips featured are the Muppets singing "Deck the Halls," Bob 
Hope and Reba McEntire performing "Silver Bells," Donny and Marie Osmond 
performing "We Need a Little Christmas" and The Chipmunks trilling "Chipmunk 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday snippets were pulled from the TV series "The Flip Wilson Show," 
"Roseanne," "The Simpsons," "The Brady Bunch," "December Bride" and "St. 
Elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsh's favorite Christmas clip didn't even make the special. "It was 'The 
Colgate Comedy Hour' with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in 1952," he says. "There 
is a piece from that show in the program, but the funniest sketch (about Abbott 
wanting a scalp massage) took 12 minutes and it was impossible to excerpt. It 
puts me on the floor every time. That's really the joy of working on a show 
like this. You find stuff like that. ..." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most unusual clips is a 1960 "Kraft Music Hall" sequence with Perry 
Como and Virginia O'Hanlon, who, in 1897 at the age of 8, wrote a letter to the 
editor of the New York Sun inquiring if Santa Claus was real. 
</P>
<P>
 Her letter inspired one of the most famous editorials in newspaper history, 
which began with the now-famous phrase, "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus 
..." When Como talked to Virginia, she was about 73 years old, Hirsh says. "He 
asks her to read the letter that she wrote to the New York Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a lot of clip shows, Hirsh's "general practice is to run clips longer. 
I mean we have some things in here that are a minute and half, which in the 
world of clip shows is sometimes considered an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nat (King) Cole and Danny Kaye did a thing called 'Jingle Journey' (from "The 
Danny Kaye Show") and in its original version it almost ran four minutes," 
Hirsh says. "We are slightly under two minutes." And viewers will see Judy 
Garland and Mel Torme perform "The Christmas Song" in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsh got a lot of mileage out of the 1960 "Jack Benny Show" episode in which 
Benny goes Christmas shopping and makes life miserable for the store salesman 
played by Mel Blanc. "Mel Blanc cracks Benny up and Benny nearly loses it. It 
is hysterically funny and we use it in five pieces in the 'Gift Giving' act." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a Christmas gift show wouldn't be complete without Bing Crosby 
performing one of his best-loved hits, "White Christmas." The special has Der 
Bingle's last performance of the Irving Berlin standard, taped in London in 
1977. Also included from Crosby's final show is his duet of "The Little Drummer 
Boy" with David Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Osmond was Hirsh's choice to play host. "I don't believe that the host 
brings people to a clip show," he says. "I think people want to see the clips, 
and what you need is a host who can do the job and frankly stand back and 
introduce (the clips). For this show, I needed a host who could sing. Marie was 
just a delight to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 "Television Christmas Classics" airs Friday at 10 p.m. on CBS.

VETTING EDDIE

<P>
 Regarding David Mennie's letter about Eddie Vedder (Dec. 4): 
</P>
<P>
 For one, Pearl Jam is far from being overrated, and you would know that if you 
stopped listening to the media and actually listened to the group's music. 
</P>
<P>
 You would realize that the lyrics come from deep down in Eddie's soul.Give 
them a chance, and if you don't like their music, don't listen! 
</P>
<P>
 It's simple. Pearl Jam is only five decent men trying to make an honest 
living, and they seem to be doing all right. 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. Queensryche went out with the Hula-Hoop. Pearl Jam rules Seattle now, and 
still will rule Seattle a long time from now. 
</P>
<P>
 RACHEL COLLETTA 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I know the media talks way too much about Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam, 
especially because they don't like all the publicity. But if there is anyone to 
be given credit to, it's them. 
</P>
<P>
 I just had to say something after I read some responses to Nov. 20 article 
"All Revved Up," putting them down and thinking they are doing everything for 
money and fame. 
</P>
<P>
 If they wanted money, they would not have canceled their tour last summer to 
fight with Ticketmaster so their fans could pay less for concert tickets. They 
could have easily gone on tour, made a lot of money and not have looked like 
bad guys, because they would just be going along with the system like other 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is anyone to look up to in this corrupt and greedy society, it's 
Pearl Jam.

MIX MASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Jackson Harris' letter Dec. 4 about my ability to mix 50 
projects in a single year: That number refers to the yearly average of records 
done at our Idful Studios during the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The average amount of time spent recording and mixing per project has been 
just under five days. Obviously, this average has gone up substantially in 
1994. While the majority of these records were done by me, the most I've ever 
had to crank out in one year is 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly worthy of Mr. Harris' comparison to God but, uh, thanks anyway.

<P>
 Regarding Roger Hurst's uninformed reaction to Tim Lucas' remarks about Rhino 
Home Video's Elvira releases (Letters, Dec. 11): 
</P>

 The truth is, film buffs and collectors are the main audience for these 
ignored-by-the-mainstream horror films of the '50s. 
</P>

 Having Elvira's face superimposed over one-quarter of the screen, cracking 
insipid jokes, is an insult to the viewer as well as to the film.

MYSTERY OF KOREAN WAR'S SECRET AIR FORCE MISSION IS UNRAVELED; MILITARY: 
RELATIVES SAY THEY FINALLY HAVE PIECED TOGETHER HOW A U.S. SPY PLANE AND ITS 
CREW MEMBERS WERE SHOT DOWN IN 1950 BY THE SOVIETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BURNS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Dec. 5, 1950, the day after Capt. Charles E. McDonough was shot down in his 
Korean War spy plane, an Air Force telegram arrived in Glen Rose, Tex. With 
official regret and a note of haunting finality, it informed his wife, Mary Jo, 
that the plane had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "All possible search completed," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was gone, silently swallowed up in a war that would keep many grim secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The search, though, was anything but completed. In a sense, it had not yet 
begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 44 years after the Air Force gave up on McDonough and the three other 
Americans aboard his silvery RB-45 reconnaissance bomber, new information has 
come to light -- evidence that points to Soviet involvement not only in the 
shoot down but also in exploiting McDonough after his capture. The evidence, 
not yet publicly disclosed by the U.S. government, contradicts recent denials 
by Moscow that the former Soviet Union had played any role. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the RB-45 and its crew on Dec. 4, 1950, isn't even mentioned in 
the Air Force's official history of the Korean War, although it notes that two 
planes of that type flew in the war. (The unmentioned McDonough plane, tail 
number 8-015, made three.) 
</P>
<P>
 McDonough, of New London, Conn., was commander of the three-plane detachment 
which flew missions mainly over North Korea from Yokota Air Base, Japan. At 31, 
this was his second war; he flew bombers in Europe in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The RB-45, well before the U-2 and now an artifact of the Cold War, was no 
ordinary plane. It was converted from a jet bomber as the most advanced photo 
reconnaissance plane in the world, and this was its first wartime use. The Air 
Force knew the RB-45 was a target of Soviet intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow was aware that U.S. Air Force planes were overflying its territory 
throughout the 1950s, but it didn't become an international issue until the 
Soviets shot down Francis Gary Powers in a CIA-operated U-2 spy plane on May 1, 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
 This story of the RB-45 is based on interviews with relatives of two of the 
four crewmen, officers who knew them, and retired Korean War RB-45 pilots, as 
well as declassified war records and other government documents. It is the 
first published account of what the Air Force called simply a "mission over 
enemy territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the effort to unravel the case are Jeanne Dear, the only child of 
Charles and Mary Jo McDonough, and Nancy Dean, the daughter of Col. John R. 
Lovell, a top Air Force intelligence officer who was based at the Pentagon but 
happened to be aboard the plane for reasons that may never be fully known. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear, 44, of Ft. Worth, was 6 months old at the time. Because she never knew 
her father, she says, the pain of sifting through his past doesn't sting as 
badly. But her voice makes clear that the emotional armor she wears is not 
impenetrable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard," she said. "It's a commitment I feel to my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 For her and Dean the search has been complicated by the secret nature of the 
RB-45. 
</P>
<P>
 Although never officially acknowledged by Washington, men who flew this plane 
in Korea say their top-secret missions sometimes took them deep into Chinese 
and Soviet airspace. More routinely, it flew photo reconnaissance over North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Records that could shed light on McDonough's mission that fateful day have not 
been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Carrington of Tyler, Tex., one of the two other pilots in McDonough's 
unit, recalls that "Mac" and his crew, attired in blue flight suits, took off 
into clear skies from Yokota Air Base at about lunchtime on Dec. 4. He 
remembers McDonough, 6-foot-3 and blue-eyed, as a likable, accomplished, robust 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could do anything," Carrington says. 
</P>
<P>
 The last word from the RB-45 crew was a routine radio contact 100 minutes 
after takeoff, signaling their entry into North Korean airspace. Then, 
everlasting silence. The crash site was never pinpointed. No bodies were 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The McDonough and Lovell daughters haven't lived on hope that their fathers 
are alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get sucked into the emotional quagmire," said Dean, 62, who was a 
freshman at the College of William and Mary when her father was listed as 
missing. "My father would not have wanted that." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she's convinced there is more to the story than the Air Force admits. 
</P>
<P>
 John (Jack) Lovell, then 46, worked directly for the head of Air Force 
intelligence, Maj. Gen. Charles P. Cabell. Lovell's daughter recently found in 
the National Archives a declassified report, stamped top secret, that was 
signed by Cabell and included a proposal for using the RB-45 for reconnaissance 
over the Soviet Union. It was dated Oct. 5, 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovell's presence on the plane is a mystery. He was not a regular crew member, 
but Dean believes Lovell had a hand in overseeing the RB-45's spy role. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Barkey, who worked with Lovell in Army intelligence during World War 
II, says an officer with as much knowledge of secret U.S. war plans as Lovell 
normally would not be allowed to fly over enemy-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a leader, and the qualities of leadership require sometimes taking 
risks," Barkey said. He figures Lovell had responsibility for the RB-45 program 
and therefore wanted to see firsthand what risks its crews were facing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean recalls helping her father pack his bags on Nov. 23, Thanksgiving Day. He 
left that night, saying only that he was headed to the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then there have been only two hints of his fate: 
</P>
<P>
 * His name was mentioned in an "enemy broadcast" picked up by U.S. 
intelligence in China on May 21, 1951, which suggested he had been captured in 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 * His was among 71 names of Americans listed by the U.S. Far East Command as 
"men positively identified as remaining in the hands of the Communists" after 
the final exchange of Allied and Communist POWs in September, 1953. Yet he 
never was officially listed as a POW. Dean recently obtained the list from a 
declassified Dec. 14, 1954, report in the files of the U.S. Far East Command. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year earlier, on Feb. 28, 1954, the government had declared Lovell 
dead. He was from Ottumwa, Iowa, a graduate of West Point (class of '27), a 
former U.S. Olympic boxing team coach and a veteran of Cold War espionage. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other men on board were co-pilot Capt. Jules E. Young, 29, of East 
Rochester, N.Y., and 1st Lt. James J. Picucci, 32, of New York City, the 
navigator. 
</P>
<P>
 When the daughters of Lovell and McDonough started researching the incident in 
detail in 1992, both were surprised to learn that many records from that period 
are lost; many are still classified secret, off-limits to most citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear began her quest in earnest in 1992 when, at the prodding of an aunt, she 
called the Air Force casualty office at Randolph Air Force Base, Tex., to ask 
for the file on her father. Her family had been told before that his service 
records had burned in a records center fire in St. Louis in the 1970s, but this 
time the casualty official said she would check and call back. 
</P>
<P>
 The return call was a bombshell: Her father's name was on a list of U.S. 
airmen provided by the Russian government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was absolutely stunned," Dear recalls. But no one could tell her what the 
list was, whether she should think her father had been taken by the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't have a clue," she said. The Russian list indicates that McDonough 
and other U.S. POWs were interrogated by Soviet officers. Indeed, the Russians 
later released a copy of a McDonough interrogation which says a Soviet 
"prepared the questions" and "a Chinese comrade translated" the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Moscow denies it ever had contact with the RB-45 crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear began digging. She attended congressional hearings in Washington and 
searched Air Force archives at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala., and at the 
National Archives in Washington and Suitland, Md. She pored over historical 
records at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., collected books on 
the Korean War and the Air Force, and tracked down anyone who might be of help. 
</P>
<P>
 She found Nancy Dean, who coincidentally had begun her own research. Dean, 
helped by her husband, Dick, fired off letters, organized documents and plotted 
her search strategy from a basement "war room" in her Wheaton, Md., home. 
</P>
<P>
 Many questions about the RB-45 case went unanswered in the years after the 
last American POWs returned from Korea, but the one that mattered most to each 
crew member's family was: Did he, in fact, die? 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jo McDonough stayed in Glen Rose after her husband was listed as missing. 
She never changed houses, never married again. 
</P>
<P>
 But she didn't wait idly. She sought out her husband's colleagues when they 
returned after the war. She wrote to families of other missing airmen and urged 
them to press for a full accounting. In a letter to President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower on Jan. 5, 1954, Mrs. McDonough wrote, "This matter is more 
important to me and to the thousands in my position than anything else. And 
we're not going to forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 She got no answers. Hope wore away with the passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, thanks to her daughter's persistence, and quite apart from the 
government's own efforts, an answer came in October, 1993: McDonough died about 
two weeks after his plane was shot down. Not all details are known, and the 
body has not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother had been waiting for 40 years," Jeanne Dear said. "For us it's like 
a miracle" to know for sure he died, and to complete their grieving. 
</P>
<P>
 She plans a memorial service for her father today in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the hundreds of relatives of Korean War MIAs, she apparently is the first 
to have confirmed a death through her own research and a network of contacts in 
the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the clinching evidence came not from U.S. government files but 
from Russia, whose MIG fighters shot down McDonough's plane near the Yalu River 
that separates North Korea from China. McDonough parachuted from the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-page document which said McDonough had died was found in Russian 
archives by Paul Cole of the research firm Defense Forecasts Inc., who has 
extensively studied Soviet links to Korean War MIA cases. Dear got a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was dated Dec. 18, 1950 -- exactly two weeks after the shoot down -- but 
did not indicate the exact date or cause of death. Routing notations on the 
document indicate it circulated at the highest levels of the Soviet military 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am informing you that the pilot from the shot-down B-45 aircraft died en 
route and the interrogation was not finished," said the note in Russian. It was 
signed by Marshal Stepan Krasovskii, the senior Soviet military adviser to 
China, and addressed to Marshal Pavel Batitskii, chief of the General Staff in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 This fits with recollections of the only American known to have talked to 
McDonough after he was shot down. Retired Air Force pilot Hamilton B. Shawe 
Jr., of Reno, Nev., said he spent about three days with McDonough as a POW in a 
bombed-out prison in Sinuiju, in northern Korea, starting about Dec. 14. He 
says he last saw McDonough being taken away from the prison on an ox cart, and 
that he was in such bad condition that it seemed unlikely he could live much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawe said McDonough told him he had parachuted from the burning wreckage of 
the RB-45. He later suffered severe frostbite while trying to evade capture in 
the frozen wilds. When he sought food at an isolated Korean house, the 
occupants turned him in to the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawe reported his contact with McDonough to the Air Force in 1953 when he was 
released from captivity. On the basis of his information, and the lack of other 
news, the Air Force issued a presumptive finding of death on March 1, 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the McDonough family members accept the Russian document as evidence 
that he died, they realize it raises other questions. Where were they taking 
him when he died? What did the Soviets want from him? What was done with the 
body? 
</P>
<P>
 A second Russian document obtained by Cole this year makes the Soviet link 
even clearer. It says the RB-45 was shot down about 45 miles east of Andung, 
China, just across the border from Sinuiju, North Korea. The report summarizes 
what McDonough said under a Soviet-controlled interrogation and asks that 
Russian "advisers" in Korea help retrieve downed American aircraft and 
"details." 
</P>
<P>
 This document was dated Dec. 17, 1950, and was signed by the Soviet commander 
of the 64th Fighter Aviation Corps, which headed Soviet air operations in 
Korea. The note was addressed to top military officers in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1994, Dear learned more painful details through a confidential 
source who interviewed the MIG pilot, A. F. Andrianov, who is credited with 
shooting down the RB-45. Andrianov recalled being told by the Soviet officer 
who interrogated McDonough that while McDonough was being moved from Sinuiju, 
apparently on Dec. 18, a sign was hung on him, "U.S. War Criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of North Koreans gathered around the defiant American and beat him to 
death, Dear said. For that final injustice, she and her mother hold both the 
North Koreans and the former Soviet Union responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Andrianov said he saw only one parachute emerge from the RB-45, Nancy 
Dean now accepts that her father, Lovell the intelligence officer, died in the 
crash. Her search, too, is ended, though she still wonders why her father was 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not the mystery of the RB-45 is ever fully unraveled, Mary Jo 
McDonough will always remember the good days before her husband left for Korea, 
and wonder about a cryptic departing remark on the sensitivity of his mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember he said, 'There is something I wish I could tell you, but I 
can't.' "

SOME GROWERS CULTIVATE COTTON IN VIVID COLORS; FIBERS: THE COLORED FLUFF IS 
GAINING POPULARITY WITH ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE 
ALLERGIC TO THE DYES IN REGULAR COTTON.

 Johnny Dunn's cotton patch is awash in millions of light green, light brown 
and rusty red bolls. Dunn is among eight farmers in Georgia, North Carolina and 
Virginia who are taking part in the first experimental planting of naturally 
colored cotton on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the coming thing for the consumer," said Dunn, one of three 
Georgia farmers who agreed to grow 90 acres of naturally colored cotton. 
"You've got a lot of people who are environment-crazed. They want everything 
natural." 
</P>
<P>
 The colored fluff is processed into cloth that is gaining popularity with 
environmentally conscious consumers and people who are allergic to the dyes in 
regular cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans bought $30-million worth of Earth-friendly clothing in the last year 
and the market is expanding, said Tom Reynolds, who grows organic and 
natural-color cotton near Hampton, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural cotton products, produced without dyes or bleaches, are featured 
regularly in L.L. Bean and Lands' End mail order catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers are embracing these all-natural products," said L.L. Bean 
spokeswoman Enid Stepner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has a good future," said Phil Young, merchandise manager for the 
Lands' End Coming Home catalogue. "Continued growth will depend on their 
ability to develop more colors." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists are trying to breed new varieties with longer, stronger fibers and 
higher yields. An improved green variety should be available in two years and a 
genetically engineered blue version is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers already grow about 10,000 acres of colored cotton annually in Arizona 
and Texas. It was introduced only recently in the Southeast, where most of the 
textile mills are located. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the Georgia growers, Johnny Dunn and his cousin, Wayne Dunn, live near 
the Tift County town of Omega, and the third, A. J. McCallum, farms in Coffee 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Dunn is reserving judgment on colored cotton because it has not been 
tested in Georgia's rainy and humid climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are astounded to learn that cotton comes in any other color than 
white, said McCallum. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants have asked him for samples and students have visited his farm to see 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds is the East Coast agent for BC Cotton, a breeder of colored cotton in 
Reedley, Calif., in central California. 
</P>
<P>
 Colored cotton sells for $1.30 to $1.40 per pound, compared with 65 cents to 
70 cents for white cotton. But yields on colored cotton are lower, so farmers 
may not see much difference in profits. Colored cotton may yield only one 
500-pound bale to an acre, compared with up to 2 1/2 for regular cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 Colored cotton has been grown for years in Russia, India and South and Central 
America, and Israel has become a major supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 White cotton still dominates. Mills like it because it can be dyed to keep 
pace with changes in fashions. The nation's leading colored cotton company is 
Natural Cotton Colours of Wickenburg, Ariz., 60 miles northwest of Phoenix. It 
was founded by entomologist Sally Fox, who started growing colored cotton for 
hand spinners and weavers in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 She improved the varieties and now contracts with Arizona growers to produce 
it and sell it worldwide.

ABANDONED MILITARY HOUSES HOME TO HOMELESS FAMILIES; SCREENING: U.S. HAS

A YEAR NATIONWIDE. APPLICANTS ARE ASKED WHETHER THEY TAKE DRUGS, GO OUT

 Natally Gary stood in the cozy living room of her duplex on a former military 
base and rattled off her history. 
</P>
<P>
 * Left home at 14 to escape her father's abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lost her parents in a murder-suicide four year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Single mother of five children, ages 4 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Part-time cook who earns $330 in a busy two weeks, $190 if it's slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 21, she sees in her tiny living room a chance for a new start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very hard for me," she said, tears in her eyes. "I have a chance to 
go to school and better myself and I want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary is among the first people to benefit from a federal law giving the 
homeless a shot at surplus government homes on closed military bases. She and 
her children moved into their new home at the former Lowry Air Force Base in 
early December after years of living in shelters or with friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Oct. 1, the government had approved applications from 42 groups that 
would provide housing for about 7,000 people a year nationwide, said Laura 
Weir, policy director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, 
based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 In some states, homeless families already are living near bases. The program 
at the Lowry base, which closed Oct. 1, is apparently the first involving 
on-base units. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lowry families will pay reduced rent -- generally about 30% of their 
monthly income -- for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary will pay $235 a month for her four-bedroom, two-bathroom duplex; similar 
units in the area cost about $800 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants are screened to make sure they're trying to change their lives, 
said John Parvensky, director of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, which 
is helping to run the program. 
</P>
<P>
 They're asked such questions as whether they take drugs, go out drinking and 
whether they practice birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 In Denver's metropolitan area of about 2 million people, more than 1,300 are 
homeless on a given night. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took a long, bitter fight before the Air Force approved the Lowry 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of property owners around the base opposed the plan, afraid that it 
would cause crime rates to rise, property values to decline and neighborhoods 
to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials said the battle was one of the most contentious in the 
nation, partly because the 57-year-old base is in the middle of the 
metropolitan area and in a mostly residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was resolved earlier this year when both sides agreed to set aside 
86 of the base's approximately 800 housing units for the homeless, down from 
nearly 200 sought by homeless advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeless advocates could face even more difficult battles. The federal 
law was revised to give control of surplus base housing to local redevelopment 
authorities instead of the federal government. That means neighborhood groups 
could wield more influence. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a news conference earlier this month, hostilities were set aside as 
representatives of some Lowry-area homeowner groups welcomed families moving 
into the duplexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the integration will help the families who have been homeless by 
providing positive role models," Parvensky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary sees brighter days ahead. She hopes to be an emergency medical technician 
and, eventually, a pharmacist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't give up. When my parents passed away, I didn't give up," she said. 
"I'll make it. I've made it this far."

WILD STORMS RAGE FAR BEYOND MOTHER EARTH; WEATHER: THE MOST IMPRESSIVE OF ALL 
'BLOCKING HIGHS,' JUPITER'S GREAT RED SPOT, IS A CALDRON OF CLOUDS STIRRED BY 
FIERCE WINDS THAT HAVE BEEN IN TURMOIL FOR AT LEAST 300 YEARS.

<P>
 If any strange weather occurs in the next few months, some people probably 
will blame Jupiter and the chunks of comet that slammed into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong, but not as far-fetched as it sounds. By studying the effects of the 
comet's impacts, scientists may learn more about Earth's atmosphere and 
weather. Like Earth, Jupiter and some other planets in the solar system come 
equipped with an atmosphere, clouds, jet streams and storms. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the longest-running known storm in the 
universe, has a lot in common with a weather pattern on Earth called a 
"blocking high." 
</P>
<P>
 "Both are high-pressure systems that prevent other conditions from intruding," 
said Timothy E. Dowling, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology. "On Earth, blocking highs can last for months and cause droughts 
by fending off the rain clouds that would normally water a region. They 
commonly occur in central Russia and the Midwestern United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The granddaddy of all blocking highs, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is a caldron 
of whirling clouds stirred by fierce winds that have been in turmoil for at 
least 300 years. At times, as many as three Earths would fit inside it. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a rock in a stream, the Red Spot blocks other swiftly passing clouds and 
sends them spinning into short-lived eddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there are hundreds of little guys too," said Dowling. Jupiter roils with 
smaller versions of the Great Red Spot. These vortices interact with heat from 
the planet's interior, setting in motion bands of jet streams. Winds on Jupiter 
have been calculated at more than 260 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of meandering unpredictably like terrestrial hurricanes, storms on 
Jupiter simply drift at a constant rate either eastward or westward," said 
Dowling. "One reason for the simpler situation is the lack of mountain ranges 
and air-sea interfaces that act on Earth to thwart the natural tendency for 
winds to settle into steady east-west patterns." 
</P>
<P>
 But winds on Jupiter are gentle zephyrs compared to those on Neptune. Orbiting 
in a deep freeze of minus 328 degrees, Neptune unleashes winds estimated at 
nearly 1,250 m.p.h., the fastest in the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest storm on Neptune, an Earth-size vortex called the Great Dark Spot, 
wears a scarf of bright clouds, much like those on Earth's mountain peaks. 
Winds racing around Neptune are deflected upward by the storm, creating the 
rapidly changing companion clouds. The clouds and storms form as convection 
shoots hydrocarbon gases up into colder regions, where they condense into 
bright ice. 
</P>
<P>
 As with Jupiter and Neptune, internal heat drives Saturn's turbulence. About 
every 30 years, a huge area of white clouds erupts near the planet's equator 
and encircles Saturn for a few months. The last episode occurred in October, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In these clouds, moisture condenses and liberates its latent heat, said 
Dowling. "This kind of storm seems to explode like a bomb. It's the same kind 
of energy source that raises cumulus towers high into the air on Earth and 
powers hurricanes." 
</P>
<P>
 Once mistaken for clouds by telescope astronomers, great dust storms 
periodically rage across Mars for months, creating a yellowish haze. Some grow 
so large that they blanket the entire planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see dune fields on Mars as big as the Sahara," said Ronald Greeley, an 
Arizona State University geologist. "It takes 100 m.p.h. winds to raise the 
dust into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence of extraterrestrial volcanoes also intrigues scientists studying 
the possible correlation to eruptions on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Venus has a large amount of volcanic activity, so much so that it appears 
that the surface is, in geological terms, relatively new, although the planet 
itself, like Earth, is 4.5 billion years old," said Edward C. Stone, director 
of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. "The surface has been recoated by 
volcanic flows to the extent that its average age is only about 500 million 
years."

SIMON BOLIVAR STILL STIRS PASSIONS 164 YEARS LATER; HISTORY: WHEN AN 
UNFLATTERING PAINTING OF THE REVOLUTIONARY HERO WAS INCLUDED IN AN EXHIBITION 
AT A LONDON GALLERY, SOUTH AMERICANS WERE INCENSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Simon Bolivar died 164 years ago, but the passion of South Americans for "The 
Liberator" still burns hotly and is not to be trifled with. 
</P>
<P>
 When an unflattering painting depicting the revolutionary hero as partly 
clothed with female breasts and making an obscene gesture was included in an 
exhibition at a London gallery, South Americans were incensed. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuelans massed at their native son's imposing statue near Congress in 
August and demanded the painting by Chilean artist Juan Davila be burned. 
Diplomats from Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia protested to Chile's government, 
which also criticized the artwork. The flap was front-page news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm crying because it hurts me," a housewife, Aurora Pineda, screamed into a 
megaphone at the Caracas demonstration. "It's not right that the father of our 
country be mocked." 
</P>
<P>
 University student Litdell Diaz also spoke: "My dignity is offended. Bolivar 
is here. He's not dead. He's in each one of his children." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who led five South American nations to independence from Spain, and 
dreamed of creating a sort of United States of South America, is much more than 
a dusty historical figure. 
</P>
<P>
 His deeds and thoughts resonate in Bolivia, which was named for him, and in 
Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. But they are felt perhaps most of all in this 
Caribbean nation where he was born in 1783 and which still laments his lonely 
flight to exile and early death at age 47. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cult of Bolivar is the main reason for unity among Venezuelans," former 
President Ramon J. Velasquez, a historian, said in an interview. "His ideas are 
still current. They're not just something you go to the library to read about." 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela's current president, Rafael Caldera, also is a Bolivar fan. In an 
essay published last June, he saluted Bolivar for being the "highest 
expression" of Venezuela's values and an inspiration for its constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great romantic dreamer, but he was also a man of action, and he 
didn't subjugate an entire continent as Napoleon did -- he liberated it," said 
British filmmaker Michael Cooper, who plans an epic movie that he hopes will 
thrust Bolivar back into the spotlight outside South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper promises his film will reflect the grandeur of Bolivar and his 
accomplishments, but South Americans are wary. Many feel Colombian author 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez tarnished Bolivar's reputation with "The General in His 
Labyrinth." That best-selling 1989 novel depicted Bolivar in his final days as 
rejected and bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything less than a glowing tribute is likely to mean trouble for Cooper. He 
acknowledges he faces the same situation that American director Oliver Stone 
confronted in trying to film a version of the play "Evita," about the famed 
wife of the 1940s and '50s Argentine leader Juan Peron. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Argentines consider her a saint for her work for the poor. So when 
President Carlos Menem of Argentina found out the movie might depict her as 
power-hungry and promiscuous, Stone was blocked from filming at government 
buildings. He ended up shelving the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivar portraits are ubiquitous in Venezuela. The standard one, a 
reproduction of an 1825 oil painting, shows him standing confidently with one 
gloved hand tucked into a tight military waistcoat, the other gripping a sword 
in a decorated scabbard, looking serenely content, a man of destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 On his birthday, July 24, newspapers still publish his portrait on the front 
page. Venezuelans can tell you the year he died, 1830. The exact date, too: 
Dec. 17. It's a national holiday. So is his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 In most every city and village, "Liberator" avenue is a main thoroughfare, and 
a well-tended Bolivar Plaza is located outside a prominent church, government 
building or military base.

3-D, COMPUTERIZED CADAVER ON THE INTERNET; MEDICINE: THE 'VISIBLE MAN' IS A 
DETAILED ATLAS OF THE KILLER'S BODY, ASSEMBLED DIGITALLY FROM THOUSANDS OF 
X-RAY, MAGNETIC AND PHOTO IMAGES OF CROSS-SECTIONS.

<P>
 Sixteen months ago, a killer was executed in Texas. Today, his body is a 
teaching tool for the world, made available on the Internet as the first 
three-dimensional, computerized cadaver. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Visible Man" is a detailed atlas of the human body, assembled digitally 
from thousands of X-ray, magnetic and photo images of cross-sections of the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Library of Medicine unveiled the "Visible Man" in late November 
at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time such detailed information about an entire human body 
has been compiled," said Dr. Donald A. B. Lindberg, director of the library, 
which is the equivalent of the Library of Congress for medical matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The digitalized cadaver will be available free to anyone who gets permission 
from the library. But the data is so extensive that downloading it takes up to 
two weeks of uninterrupted time on the Internet, and up to 15 gigabytes of 
storage space, enough to accommodate about 50 times the contents of The 
Encyclopedia Britannica. 
</P>
<P>
 The information would fill more than 30 typical personal computers and is 
expected to be sought mainly by medical schools and researchers, said Michael 
Ackerman, a computer specialist with the library. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Visible Man" will be an immediate teaching tool for medical students, and 
in the future, it could be used to develop surgery simulators much like the 
flight simulators used to train pilots today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hold this out as an example of the future of health care . . . which more 
and more will become visual rather than textual," Ackerman said. "It's a whole 
different way of looking at medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 The library is spending $1.4 million to develop the "Visible Man" and a 
"Visible Woman," which is still more than a year away, said Victor Spitzer, a 
computer-imager and anatomist at the University of Colorado Health Sciences 
Center in Denver, where the imaging was done. 
</P>
<P>
 The work began on Aug. 5, 1993, several hours after the execution by injection 
of Joseph Paul Jernigan, 39, an ex-mechanic who killed a 75-year-old man during 
a burglary and who left his body to science. The body was flown to Colorado and 
underwent hours of CAT and MRI scans. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was sawed into four pieces and each was frozen in gelatin. One at a 
time, each piece was attached to a special table and slowly raised under a 
special planing tool called a cryomacrotome. 
</P>
<P>
 The instrument, designed especially for cutting cadavers, shaved away 
cross-sections of the cadaver 1 millimeter thick -- a total of 1,870 
cross-sections from head to toe. Each newly exposed layer of cadaver was 
photographed and scanned into a computer by a digital camera.

PARENTS WITH AIDS, FAMILY SHARE HOLIDAY 
</P>

 Life couldn't get much tougher for Abel Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 He's rearing his sisters' six children in a one-bedroom apartment in one of 
the city's poorest neighborhoods.One sister died of AIDS and the other may soon 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez tried to put his troubles aside last Sunday at a Christmas party for 
103 children whose parents, many of them poor and most women raising children 
alone, are dying of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "This party is a nice break," said Martinez, a 31-year-old who looks more like 
the brother than the guardian of his nephew and five nieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gifts, the entertainment. We have sadness, but being here keeps everyone 
from thinking about it for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second annual party for AIDS families served by Selfhelp, a 
nonprofit agency founded by Holocaust survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Selfhelp provides home-care workers to keep a family together as long as 
possible by helping parents do laundry, cook and run errands. The agency also 
helps find guardians to raise the children when their mothers die. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful to come and see all this," Nelida Burgos, a 32-year-old mother 
of three, said at the party. "You're so happy you forget you are sick. And 
that's nice for the holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, like some of the other families, has a double burden -- children who 
are HIV positive. Martinez's nephew, 3 1/2-year-old Michael, was born with the 
virus. The boy's mother, who died in January, was infected with the disease 
through sexual contact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the home-care workers were on hand to chase after children while sick 
parents relaxed. There was a sing-along, a clown performing magic tricks, and 
Santa Claus, of course.

PHILIPPINES' 'DODGE CITY' STARTS OVER; SOUTHEAST ASIA: THE PORT CITY OF DAVAO 
WAS MARKED BY CRIME AND VIOLENCE. CIVIC LEADERS HOPE TRADE AND BUSINESS WILL 
TAKE THEIR PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that crime and violence have been cleaned up, government leaders are 
striving to shed this southern port's image as the "Dodge City of the 
Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal is to attract investment and build Davao into a major business 
center, based on its good location for trade with Indonesia and other Southeast 
Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The task is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few years ago, this port of 1 million people on the southern end of 
Mindanao Island, about 610 miles southeast of Manila, was awash in guns and 
gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Communist rebels held such a firm grip on the Agdao slum district that it was 
nicknamed "Nicaraguagdao." Gunmen from the pro-government Alsa Masa (Masses 
Arise) militia patrolled the streets. Common crime was rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a devastated economy. Business stagnated so much that the 
construction of a single cement plant in 1993 represented a 3,420% increase in 
investment over the previous year. The official jobless rate is 10%, but 
private economists estimate that about 40% of the area's workers do not have 
full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 All that is changing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communist influence has waned because of both the vigilantes and 
factionalism in rebel ranks. Alsa Masa gunmen no longer patrol the streets, and 
the city bustles with activity unseen only a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Davao is in the midst of a construction boom, and traffic clogs the streets. 
The city recently introduced a fleet of new radio-equipped taxis. In October, 
the national government approved a $114-million, five-year plan for expanding 
and improving the city's airport to encourage traffic with neighboring nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our skyline is changing every month," Mayor Rodrigo Duterte said. "The city 
is peaceful now. We have been able to restore infrastructure and provide 
stability for our investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the relative peace, Davao is hardly Singapore, the serene business 
hive of Southeast Asia. Last Christmas, suspected Muslim extremists hurled 
grenades into the city's Roman Catholic cathedral, killing seven people and 
wounding dozens of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidnapings are an ever-present danger throughout Mindanao, an underdeveloped 
island of about 16 million people. Still, residents interviewed said they feel 
safer now that Duterte has cracked down on street crime in Davao. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S., Japanese and other embassies no longer discourage their citizens 
from visiting Davao, although they advise caution. 
</P>
<P>
 To promote its new image, the city has launched an "Invest in Davao" campaign, 
highlighting opportunities in transshipment of goods within the region, 
tourism, light industry, agribusiness and processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The city faces some of the western Pacific's leading fishing grounds, and 
important banana, pineapple and coconut plantations are nearby. It also is 
close to Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, and to Malaysia, 
where the economy is booming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to project Davao," said Syvelyn Tan, project manager of the city's 
Private Investment and Trade Opportunities office. "Our problem was one of 
unfair perception. We want to show the good side of Davao." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is putting finishing touches on a three-story Business Center, 
financed in part by the U.S. Agency for International Development, where 
investors will be able to get computerized information on opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of changes are taking place," Duterte said. "It's not really an 
economic takeoff, but it's definitely an upswing." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign interest remains limited. In 1988, when Davao's image was at a low 
point, the city organized an ambitious trade promotion conference and planned 
to invite U.S. President George Bush, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of 
Britain and Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca. 
</P>
<P>
 But after consulting the Department of Foreign Affairs, city officials 
scratched the heavies and instead invited all foreign ambassadors accredited in 
Manila. Only one, from Australia, attended, and he showed up incognito.

NEW FEAR FROM FOOD SCIENCE: STEALTH ALLERGEN; BIOLOGY: GENETIC ENGINEERING WILL 
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT REALLY IS INSIDE THE CASSEROLE DISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 If you're allergic to nuts, it's easy enough to pass up the cocktail mix. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may not be so easy for people to pass up some of the potential 
allergy-triggering mixes from genetic manipulation of corn, tomatoes, squash 
and countless other foods. 
</P>
<P>
 What if, for example, something from a Brazil nut is put into some soybeans, 
which end up in everything from baby formula to bologna? 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of question would have seemed foolish before scientists learned to 
move genetic material from plant to plant, animal to plant, bacteria to plant, 
virus to plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Government regulators, biotech companies and physicians have grown 
increasingly concerned about the prospect of shuffling allergens into the deck 
of a food's DNA. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the price of wrongful noshing runs from hives to a life-threatening 
asthma attack for any of the millions of Americans who are allergic to nuts, 
eggs, milk peanuts and other foods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that you transfer raises a question," said Dr. Hugh A. Sampson, 
pediatrician and food allergy specialist at the Johns Hopkins University School 
of Medicine. "You've just got to decide how likely is it to be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope that by adding, deleting or changing hereditary traits they 
can develop crops that taste better, stay fresh longer, offer more nutrients 
and fewer fats, resist pests, or tolerate herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
 But the effort by the world's largest seed company to pack more nourishment 
into a soybean shows what a risky business genetic engineering can be -- and 
how well the few safeguards have worked so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. of Des Moines knew that 
Brazil nuts have methionine, a sulfur-rich amino acid that livestock and 
poultry need. 
</P>
<P>
 Soybeans are a top livestock feed, but they are poor in sulfur. Adding 
methionine would make the soybeans more of a superfeed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pioneer knew about the allergy problem. The Food and Drug Administration 
told biotech companies in May, 1992, to check for allergens when they test the 
safety of their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer asked for help from Stephen Taylor, head of the food science 
department of the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor tried the product on blood serum from people with nut allergies and 
found there was a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are evaluating the research project for the best path forward," said Steve 
Daugherty, company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Options include finding a way to transfer the protein without the allergen, or 
dropping the project altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The test showed it is possible to screen bio-engineered foods for known 
allergens. It also holds out the promise that scientists can use biotechnology 
to start snipping out allergens. 
</P>
<P>
 But biotechnology also raises the specter of creating or adding new 
allergy-inducing substances to the food supply from sources like the viral coat 
proteins that can help a plant resist disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists argue that the risks are low, particularly since it appears 
that only a handful of the tens of thousands of proteins out there cause 
allergies. The new materials introduced by genetic engineering are added in low 
levels and may not be present in the edible part of the food. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, ignorance about food allergies makes it difficult to get as clear a 
picture of the hazards as most scientists would like. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no foolproof test" for suspected allergens, said Taylor, who 
nonetheless believes the risks are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists estimate that food allergies afflict about 2% of young children and 
1% of adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Peanuts, milk, eggs, soybeans, fish and shellfish top the list of 
allergy-causing foods in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 The biotechnology revolution could be a boost for food allergy researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would you go out and spend millions of dollars isolating dozens of food 
allergens when you have no purpose for it?" said Dr. Dean Metcalfe, of the 
government's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "Suddenly, 
now, you need it."

EX-OFFICIAL DETAILS TRAUMA IN YEAR AT SMALL HOSPITAL; MEDICINE: SUSAN GARRETT 
TELLS OF GRAPPLING WITH SOARING COSTS, RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND 
INCREASED REGULATIONS. HER NEW BOOK, 'TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN,' DELVES INTO THE 
SYSTEM'S INNER WORKINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A decade before health care reform emerged as a hot political issue, Susan 
Garrett became all too familiar with the pressures that fuel today's demands to 
overhaul the system. 
</P>
<P>
 As administrator of York Hospital, a 79-bed community hospital in southern 
Maine, Garrett grappled with soaring costs, rapid changes in technology and 
increased government regulation that threatened to overwhelm the 80-year-old 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new book, "Taking Care of Our Own," recounts the inner workings of York 
Hospital and the experiences of both the people who worked there and those who 
depended on the hospital for care. 
</P>
<P>
 It also concludes that small hospitals -- York and the 2,400 others like it 
across the country -- can provide important services that large, impersonal 
medical centers cannot match. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett, who spent six years at York Hospital before leaving in 1983, 
compresses her story into a one-year period in which hospital officials 
reflected upon an uncertain future and decided to undertake a risky expansion 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as many small hospitals struggle for survival, York Hospital has done 
well, Garrett said. Amid competition from half a dozen hospitals between 
Portland and Portsmouth, N.H., it offers quality programs that meet the needs 
of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Woven into her narrative are patients that range from Tim Bailey, the homeless 
man who shows up at the emergency room in bad weather or on Christmas, to 
Carrie Williams, the 85-year-old spinster who has to sell her heirlooms to pay 
for heart medication. 
</P>
<P>
 As administrator, it was Garrett's task to find ways to accommodate the needs 
of townspeople like Bailey and Williams in a system with limited finances and 
strict rules regarding government reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 In human terms, she spells out the intricacies of shifting costs from Medicare 
patients to the self-insured and the financial risks of keeping patients in the 
hospital beyond the number of days calculated for each of the government's 477 
diagnosis-related groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Other challenges included calming the frayed nerves of impatient patients 
during a tumultuous summer evening in a crowded emergency room and mediating 
disputes among hospital staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 In one memorable incident, a nurse supervisor quit on the spot after a star 
surgeon flew into a rage because two instruments had not been set out in the 
operating room. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing as an insider forced Garrett to alter the facts, both by creating 
composites of real people and by compressing events into a shorter time frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a journalist, I would have done it differently," she acknowledges. 
But by putting herself as narrator, she felt she was able to approach the 
subject in a way that gets at the truth more sharply than she might otherwise 
have done. 
</P>
<P>
 A community hospital, she said, offers "a natural continuum" ranging from 
doctors' offices to acute care to home-based care. There are education 
programs, volunteer help for the elderly and respite for family care givers, 
all provided close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do all these things without a local hospital. I'm convinced of it. 
A distant hospital isn't going to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett predicts that many small hospitals will move away from acute care in 
the coming years, making them more akin to health centers that place greater 
emphasis on outpatient services and public health. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett, who now lives in Charlottesville, Va., but returns to her riverfront 
home in York for a few weeks in the summer, takes a more journalistic approach 
in a book she is writing about programs to help the elderly poor in isolated 
mountain hollows of rural Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a book about nurses, who are, I think, the future. They hold 
the system together. No question," she said.

TAKING A NEW LOOK AT SEGREGATION IN CLASSROOM; EDUCATION: IN TRYING TO SETTLE 
22-YEAR-OLD LAWSUIT, PHILADELPHIA OFFICIALS WILL FOCUS ON LEARNING RESULTS 
RATHER THAN A HEAD COUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For four decades, the U.S. Supreme Court's idea that "separate but equal" 
education simply hasn't endured as a monument to progress in race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a state judge, her court-appointed panel, Philadelphia's new school 
superintendent and activists suing to reform the nation's fifth-largest school 
district have added a twist: 
</P>
<P>
 Separate might be unequal, they say, but it is a reality, and administrators 
need to face it by making segregated schools as equal as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts call the concept part of a broader approach to school desegregation 
that focuses on results and quality instead of merely head counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Separate can never be equal, because it is missing what goes on in American 
life. But there is no reason why separate has to be unequal in as many 
dimensions as it is," said Michael Churchill, executive director of the Public 
Interest Law Center of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The realization comes after 22 years of battles between the state Human 
Relations Commission and the school district in one of the nation's longest 
desegregation cases. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is how best to achieve racial equity for a student body so large it 
could fill the city's baseball stadium three times, but so segregated that only 
22% is white. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Commonwealth Court Judge Doris A. Smith found that segregation 
was virtually unavoidable and ordered a team of outside experts to spend seven 
months determining why the district is broken and how to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the verdict came back. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's 138-page report -- which Smith can accept, approve parts of or 
reject entirely -- depicted a district vexed by segregation, poor management, 
ineffective teaching and "dysfunctional organization" so entrenched that nearly 
half the city's 210,000 students fail ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 It called for comprehensive reform in curriculum, teaching methods and the way 
desegregation works. 
</P>
<P>
 The report saved its most severe criticism for the city's "racially isolated" 
schools, where more than 90% of students are minorities. It said educational 
quality there "is not even up to the low level of quality in the remaining 
district schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia's school system has 11,000 teachers in 267 schools, 133 of which 
are considered segregated. It employs more people than the city, has only a 
slightly smaller budget and, officials say, operates more school buses than the 
regional transit authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The systemwide changes would cost more than $300 million, and where the money 
will come from remains a question. 
</P>
<P>
 The report calls on the state to contribute the bulk, a recommendation that 
met with harsh criticism in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hornbeck, the district's new superintendent, believes the new emphasis 
can work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not abandoning desegregation and embracing some other doctrine," 
Hornbeck said. "It's saying that at the end of the day, whether kids have 
learned math, history, geography and science is how we measure our success." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown vs. Board of Education that an 
1896 decision, Plessy vs. Ferguson, erred in presuming the viability of 
"separate but equal" facilities for blacks and whites. 
</P>
<P>
 But though segregation by law was abolished, de facto segregation -- both 
physical and economic -- often remained. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, the school system has evolved back into a pre-Brown state," 
said Richard Couto, a University of Richmond professor who studies the effects 
of the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, in a Detroit case known as Milliken II, the U.S. Supreme Court 
amended the idea of the landmark Brown case, effectively ruling that physical 
desegregation wasn't the only kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Cases since have reflected the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 A state case pending in Alabama deals with equalizing educational opportunity, 
but doesn't deal explicitly with desegregation. Lawsuits in Kansas City and St. 
Louis, under court orders since the 1980s, also incorporate elements of 
educational equity alongside desegregation. Chicago is under a similar 
agreement after a consent decree in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia's case started in 1968, when the Human Relations Commission and 
the state Department of Education reviewed the state's schools in racial terms 
and found a number of districts segregated. It asked the districts to devise 
voluntary desegregation plans. Some did, some didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission found in 1971 that Philadelphia's schools were "unlawfully 
segregated" and ordered the district to correct racial imbalances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philadelphia's system today is worse than pre-Brown education," Churchill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Smith suggested educational improvement instead of busing -- an idea 
that specialists in educational equity say is gaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving from desegregation to educational reform within segregation, 
which is posed by many people as an easier thing to do," said Gary Orfield, 
director of the Harvard Project on School Desegregation.

MAKING PROFITS: IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR; WATERFORD: FIRM GETS BACK IN THE BLACK BY 
CUTTING EMPLOYMENT AND SELLING CHEAPER GLASSWARE FROM ABROAD UNDER DIFFERENT 
BRAND NAME.

 To most people, the chunk of crystal sitting on the table looks like a big ice 
cube, but Fred Curtis envisions a winged horse. The hard part, he says, will be 
sculpting the fragile front legs without breaking them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll wait till the place is empty at night and work here in the silence," 
Curtis tells a visitor to the Waterford Crystal plant. "This will be 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 In another room, engraver Tom Hayes balks at putting a price on a fancy 
crystal globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not being glib, but something's worth what people will pay for it," Hayes 
says. "We're trying to create an art." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis and Hayes are two of the Irish master craftsmen who make Waterford 
Crystal a household name. They are also two of the fortunate ones -- economic 
realities have left hundreds of other Irish craftsmen out of work as the 
company adjusts to a more competitive global marketplace, in part by marketing 
cheaper crystal from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterford Wedgwood PLC ran into trouble when the recession left it staggering 
under losses of around 20 million Irish pounds a year -- the equivalent of $30 
million. Investors, led by Irish tycoon Tony O'Reilly and Wall Street 
powerhouse Morgan Stanley & Co., bought a 29% stake in 1990 and put the company 
on a new course. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three years, they had erased the losses and earned 9 million Irish 
pounds in 1993, and brought the company's stock price back from 14 pence two 
years ago to nearly four times as much these days. 
</P>
<P>
 But success has come painfully. Hundreds of Irish workers lost their jobs as 
Waterford cut costs and started buying cheaper crystal from sources in Germany 
and Slovenia -- and gained a bigger share of the vital U.S. market under an 
also-ran brand name, Marquis by Waterford. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's savings from manufacturing overseas is substantial. Every time 
Waterford sells a $30 wine glass under the Marquis name, it makes more money 
than it does by selling a $50 Waterford wine glass. 
</P>
<P>
 At Waterford Wedgwood's recent annual meeting in Dublin, shareholders were 
relieved to be back in the black. But amid the expected gripes about big stock 
options for directors and the predictable clamor for a dividend -- the company 
hasn't paid one since 1988 -- were calls to bring jobs back to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment, officially listed at 15.2% but widely believed to be nearer 20%, 
is Ireland's top problem and an emotional issue -- even to Irish investors who 
profit when jobs are exported. 
</P>
<P>
 "I propose we take our money out of Germany, that doesn't need it, and put it 
back in Ireland, with our unemployment," said a shareholder who did not 
identify herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Waterford Wedgwood shareholders are concerned that selling cheaper 
crystal could hurt the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that the integrity of the brand is in grave danger if we reduce 
the number of craft workers," said Neal Duggan, a Dublin accountant. "We're in 
danger of eroding the brand." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Reilly, now chairman of Waterford Wedgwood, said Waterford's share of the 
key U.S. crystal market had advanced from 27% in 1990, the year before the 
European imports were added to the line, to 34% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a fool could not understand those numbers -- this company was headed for 
liquidation," said O'Reilly, who also runs Pittsburgh-based H. J. Heinz Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterford's chief executive, Paddy Galvin, agreed in an interview that the 
Irish shareholders "make comments with their hearts, not with their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Waterford not cut its work force to 1,500 from 3,000 over the last few 
years, slashed pay and brought in cheaper foreign crystal, the plant would have 
closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes have been bitter for Waterford's workers. But union leaders at the 
crystal plant put off repeated requests from the Associated Press to discuss 
the matter in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ordinary Irishmen cringe when asked about Waterford bringing in cheaper 
crystal from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having a Rolls-Royce made in Japan," said Dublin native Anthony 
Campion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a risk they dilute the brand name," agreed Allison Stewart, a 
marketing consultant in London. "The way they can prevent that risk is to throw 
money at the Marquis range and brand it differently."

RURAL SCHOOL'S RECRUITING EARNS AN A; EDUCATION: FACED BY DECLINING ENROLLMENT 
AS ECONOMY SPUTTERED, SCHOOL ADVERTISED ITS QUIET LEARNING ATMOSPHERE FOR 
TROUBLED STUDENTS. NOW IT'S SEEKING FAMILIES AS WELL.

 From the moment he arrived at Clayton High School, David Dailey says he knew 
he was a little different. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was his T-shirts and sneakers in classrooms where many students wear 
Western shirts and cowboy boots. Maybe it was his mountain bike alongside muddy 
pickup trucks outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was his ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the differences, the 17-year-old senior says he might not have 
finished high school if he hadn't moved to Clayton. He was one of four boys who 
accepted an offer to live in this town of 2,500 residents in New Mexico's 
remote northeastern corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Clayton school officials faced state funding cutbacks because 
of sharply declining enrollment. Families were leaving, unable to stay afloat 
as the regional economy sputtered. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent Claude Austin had an idea to counter the declining enrollment: 
advertise Clayton High School as a refuge for urban students seeking an 
intimate learning atmosphere in an environment devoid of many of the problems 
that plague cities. 
</P>
<P>
 There were four takers, including three boys who arrived as so-called 
discipline problems and stayed about one semester each before returning home 
promising to behave. 
</P>
<P>
 Dailey -- who came from Farmington, N.M. -- was the fourth student to accept 
the offer but the only one to return for his senior year. His parents pay $400 
monthly to a sponsor family for room and board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going down the wrong track," Dailey says. "I wanted to stop it before I 
wound up in jail. . . . If I had stayed in Farmington, I think I would have 
hurt somebody or myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the four high school students, school officials say there has been an 
unexpected offshoot from the recruiting pitch. They say enrollment is up at the 
elementary and junior high schools because several families have moved to 
Clayton, including some ex-residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of former students who graduated, moved away, got married 
and had kids," says John Burgess, principal at Clayton High School. "They saw 
what we were doing to attract students and looked at their own situation. Then 
I guess they said, " 'Let's go back to Clayton.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although not advertising anymore, Austin and Burgess agreed the recruiting 
program will continue as long as there is interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton is 10 miles from the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles. The high school 
has 222 students this fall, with 812 students in all grades. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1990s, the agriculture industry slowed, and as ranchers 
consolidated operations, the area's population fell. The high school -- 
enrollment 276 in 1986 -- was losing about 10 to 15 students each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin made his pitch through newspaper advertisements in Albuquerque, N.M., 
and Amarillo, Tex. News organizations flocked to Clayton to report the unusual 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually believe our schools are as good or better than any of the private 
schools in the state," Austin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin and Burgess agree Clayton isn't completely devoid of problems, even 
where drugs are involved. But they tout the school board policy allowing 
corporal punishment for many rules violations. Another advantage for 
administrators is Clayton's size. 
</P>
<P>
 "If students are doing something they're not supposed to be doing, it gets 
back to me," Burgess says. "There are rules and regulations everywhere. The 
difference is that here they're enforced on a regular basis."

YES, AMERICA, THERE WAS A CHRISTMAS EVE IN WAR-TORN ITALY; WORLD WAR II: AS A

<P>
 It was Christmas Eve, 1944, in Foggia -- 4,000 miles, 19 bombing missions and 
an eternity away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 I stood in the late afternoon watching the Italian skies darken. A squadron of 
bombers, lumbering along beneath a deep, gray bank of clouds, floated over the 
"spur of the boot" of Italy, droning like bees. 
</P>
<P>
 A P-51 flashed above the treetops, leaving the whining, whirring noise of its 
propeller dying in its wake. The playful pursuit ship faded rapidly into the 
somber darkening evening and I turned from watching it to walk toward the club. 
</P>
<P>
 It began to snow. 
</P>
<P>
 As I came to the edge of the olive grove that was the camp of the 419th Bomb 
Squadron, a truck, laden with roughly cut logs, turned off the Foggia-Lucera 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 It came to a stop alongside me and Lt. Jack deKruif of Grand Rapids, Mich., 
stepped down from the cab. A spark of pleasure in his eyes leapt when he saw me 
admiring the cargo and spread to laughter on his tired face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look what Santa Claus brought," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was red from the cold and his hands were raw. There was a smear of dirt 
across his nose. His sleeve was torn. Hanging loosely around his hips, cowboy 
fashion, dangled a belt and holster which carried an Army .45. 
</P>
<P>
 We walked around the rear of the truck and I asked him where he had gotten the 
logs, for firewood was a scarce and precious item in the areas surrounding 
Foggia. He told me that he had gone into the hills near Ariano with Pasquale, 
an Italian POW who was his helper. They had bought the load from a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a red-hot Christmas in our fireplace tonight," Jack said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 8:30 that evening the most unusual Christmas party I had ever attended 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 A voice called over the loudspeaker, announcing that the bars were open in 
both the enlisted men's and the officers' clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of fliers and ground-support personnel, dressed smartly in class-A 
uniforms, their brass polished, shoes glistening and trousers pressed, came 
gradually out of their tent and walked up the paths between the olive trees. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an inch of snow on the frozen ground and winter flavored the air 
with snappy gusts of wind that whipped swirling flurries from the branches of 
the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone had hooked the loudspeaker connection to the radio and from the Army 
station in Foggia came gently, homey Christmas music . . . "Silent Night" . . . 
"White Christmas" . . . "Adeste Fideles" . . . "I'll Be Home for Christmas" . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 I went into the club with Lt. Tom Lubeski of St. Louis, Mo., one of my new 
tentmates. We kicked the snow from our best shoes and hung our coats on nails 
near the door. There were more than 70 pilots, navigators, and bombardiers 
dressed as though for a general's inspection, throughout the club. 
</P>
<P>
 At the farther end of the building stood a Christmas tree which Jack had 
brought from the hills. Someone had decorated it with real candles that had 
come in a package from home. 
</P>
<P>
 My co-pilot, Chuck Whiting of Norwell, Mass., was behind the bar. He had on a 
red bow tie and a homemade apron. Sgt. Bill Rogers of Brandon, Miss., who would 
be shot down a few weeks later, was stirring something in a gigantic bowl at 
one end of the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of fellows clustered about the fireplace, with glasses of Italian rum 
and grapefruit juice in their hands, singing Christmas carols while Lt. Don 
Higgins of Sacramento, Calif., lovingly worked the keys of an ancient piano. 
The fire was crackling. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom and I stood at the end of the bar with four or five friends and talked 
about home, about combat, about the wonderful party we were having. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was in a holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the party, shortly before midnight, a homemade stove that had 
been installed in a corner of the building set fire to the papered ceiling and 
the flames spread rapidly through the club, putting an end to the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 We fought the fire with buckets of water at first, but the roof, built of wood 
and decorated with highly inflammable materials, caught up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 We stood outside in the snow and watched emergency fire crews extinguish the 
flames. When the fire was out, Tom and I went back into the charred building to 
view the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The crude chairs and tables had been broken and partly burned. The Christmas 
tree was a black skeleton and water, pieces of burned paper and wood covered 
the floor. Jack deKruif came running inside. "Come on you guys," he hollered, 
"get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 He looked at the fireplace. It was dripping water and the ashes were wet. Jack 
took a stick, scraped the fireplace and went outside. He came back in a moment, 
carrying an armload of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasquale brought in a huge log and placed it in front of the fireplace while 
Jack lit another fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone had put new candles on the mantle. Chuck said, "Hey you guys, I 
salvaged a case of beer . . . of course, it's a bit warm, but it's beer." 
</P>
<P>
 We sat down on the log in front of the fire. Pasquale opened the case and 
passed out the drinks. Chuck told him to sit down and have a beer with us. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasquale raised his bottle, smiled and said, "Buono Natale." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Chuck said, "And a Merry Christmas to you, Pasquale." 
</P>
<P>
 But the stench from the burned buildling soon got to us and we had to leave.

STOGIES -- OR CIGARS -- ARE IN A COMEBACK; TOBACCO: DEMAND IS SO HIGH, SOME 
TOBACCONISTS CAN'T KEEP POPULAR BRANDS IN STOCK. TODAY'S CONNOISSEURS SHUN 
CHEAP BRANDS OF YESTERYEAR. MANY SPEND AS HIGH AS $20 APIECE FOR PREMIUM, 
HAND-ROLLED SMOKES.

<P>
 Just when the cigar industry seemed in ashes, the stogie is once again on a 
roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Long associated with dim back rooms and the gangsters, poker players and 
old-boy politicians who found sanctuary there, the cigar has caught fire with a 
whole new generation of baby boomers and twentysomethings. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand is so high, some tobacconists can't keep popular brands in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more stuff on back order than we do in the store," grumbled Dan 
Wilkinson, owner of Tobacco House Ltd. in Richmond, the heart of tobacco 
country. He says he's seeing younger shoppers every week. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's connoisseurs don't puff the cheap, smelly, old-fogey 5-cent stogies of 
yesteryear. Many shell out from $1.50 to $20 apiece for premium, hand-rolled 
smokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Heye, 22, newly graduated from the University of North Carolina, limits 
himself to two $3 Hoyo Excaliburs each week. That should change once he starts 
working. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have the money to buy a nice humidor," he said happily. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers say many younger smokers are attracted to the cigar's 
mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally the cigar has been looked upon as a symbol of success, 
relaxation and achievement," said Norman Sharp, president of the Cigar Assn. of 
America in Washington. "It has a lot of romanticism about it." 
</P>
<P>
 At its current pace, this year's cigar sales should top 1993 sales by 6%, the 
first annual increase since 1970, Sharp said. Americans spent $720 million on 
cigars in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp said the turnaround has been helped by Cigar Aficionado, a glossy 
upscale quarterly devoted to premium cigars. The magazine, which debuted two 
years ago and has a circulation of 185,000, includes a column answering such 
pressing queries as how to eliminate stogie breath. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine also sponsors Cigar Nights, when fanciers pay $100 or more to don 
black tie, sip cognac, savor a five-course meal and sample premium cigars, 
usually donated by a manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigar dinners have caught on at restaurants, clubs and hotels around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigars "have layers of flavor, just as coffee and wine do. They complete the 
dining experience," said David Everett, executive chef of The Dining Room at 
Ford's Colony in Williamsburg and sponsor of four recent cigar dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-smoking activists, however, see nothing elegant about the cigar's 
resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smoking is harmful," said Tolson Brooks, a spokesman for the American Heart 
Assn. in Richmond. "Perhaps with cigars the risk is a little less, but how much 
less I couldn't tell you and I don't think anyone else could." 
</P>
<P>
 The fad may be fueled by its popularity among celebrities. In addition to 
long-time smokers like George Burns and Bill Cosby, a younger crop of puffers 
and chompers includes Whoopi Goldberg, Sylvester Stallone, Ted Danson, Patrick 
Swayze, Johnny Depp and Matt Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Bill Clinton wrote Cigar Aficionado publisher Marvin Shanken a 
congratulatory letter when the magazine was launched, said Niki Singer, the 
magazine's senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 But as with many men whose wives object to the stink, the president lives in a 
nonsmoking household.

FOR SOME, PREGNANCY OFFERS AN EXIT FROM A DREARY LIFE; FUTURE: TEEN-AGE MOTHERS 
HAVE BECOME THE PRIME TARGET OF WELFARE REFORMERS. THE STORY OF ONE 
17-YEAR-OLD, WHOSE LIFE ECHOES THOUSANDS OF OTHERS, SHOWS HOW TANGLED THE 
PROBLEM IS.

<P>
 She's an unemployed, unwed mother at 17, but Dawn Kowalski feels blessed when 
she cradles baby Justin -- a warm bundle of tomorrow dozing in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the baby came along, Dawn had no future to hold onto. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroking his fine, sandy hair, she describes her former self: a school dropout 
from a troubled home, with no job and no plans, feeling trapped in rural West 
Virginia. She wasted her days at the mall, partied all night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't care what happened to me," she said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now her world is a small apartment dotted with diapers and parenting 
magazines, the rent paid by a federal housing subsidy. She lives alone with 
10-week-old Justin, nursing him, sleeping when he sleeps, listening to country 
music because MTV makes him wail. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn may be an accidental mother, but she takes pride in being a good one. 
"This has made me a better person," she said recently. "It's really 
straightened my life out." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an odd perspective. After all, teen-age pregnancy is an avoidable 
hardship that robs many girls of their prospects and can doom their children to 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 But life unfolds haphazardly for girls like Dawn, and cause and effect aren't 
always clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe making a baby is making a future. And to them, even a shaky 
future may seem better than none at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million teen-agers will get pregnant this year; about a third of 
them will be age 17 or younger. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers will give birth to a half-million babies -- 70% born out of 
wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with other teen-age girls, teen mothers are less likely to finish 
their education, less likely to earn a decent wage, and more likely to spend 
years on welfare. Families headed by current or former teen mothers receive $34 
billion a year in government health and welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans worried as the teen pregnancy rate climbed over the past two 
decades, reflecting an increase in the number of teens having sex. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be worse, however. Teens who have sex today use birth control more 
effectively than sexually active teens of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion also has kept the teen birth rate down: more than a third of pregnant 
teens decide to abort. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-class teens have become so successful at avoiding birth that teen 
mothers are now widely perceived to be poor, black girls living in the inner 
cities. But many rural areas also have high teen birth rates, and there are 
more than twice as many white teen-age mothers as black ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The common denominator is disadvantage: 83% of teens who have babies are from 
poor or low-income families, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a 
not-for-profit research group. 
</P>
<P>
 These girls are only slightly more likely than middle-class teens to have sex. 
They are significantly more likely to get pregnant, however, and much less 
likely to have an abortion, Guttmacher found. 
</P>
<P>
 Births to single mothers are rising across society, but illegitimate babies 
are still more common among poor girls. Giving up a child for adoption is rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty overlaps with all sorts of other factors: black and Hispanic girls get 
pregnant at twice the rate of whites; studies show girls raised by a single 
parent are more likely to have babies; so are the daughters of teen mothers; 
girls who have been sexually abused; girls who are doing poorly in school or 
have dropped out; and girls who drink or use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many teen-agers don't see a baby as their biggest handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Dawn made A's in school and dreamed of being a lawyer. A favorite 
fifth-grade teacher joked that her "big mouth" would make her a good one. Dawn 
and her stepsister practiced arguing cases for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 But life at home was chaotic. Dawn's parents were always fighting; money was 
always short. Her father drank heavily and was often out of work. Dawn's mother 
says he beat her and hit the two girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever he grew too abusive, "Mom would just pack us off to the women's 
shelter," said Dawn's stepsister, Tina Fleming, now 20. "We lived in the 
shelter off and on." 
</P>
<P>
 Things got worse when Dawn's parents separated, then divorced when she was 11. 
For years Dawn was bounced back and forth between her father, whom she feared, 
and her mother, who was often broke and soon in another turbulent marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life fell apart," Dawn said. "I just gave up. I didn't bother with school 
anymore. I quit caring." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming moved in with a girlfriend and finished high school. Dawn could have 
graduated, too, Fleming says, but she had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 By then Dawn was routinely skipping school, staying out late, drinking at 
parties. She tried sex for the first time at age 15, Dawn said, because 
"everybody was talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after she turned 16, Dawn quit school. A few months later, she was 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Teen mothers have become a favorite target of welfare reformers in both 
political parties -- they say the current system rewards teens for having 
illegitimate babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls like Dawn get welfare checks and other aid that lets them set up their 
own households and feel like instant adults, even if they are barely scraping 
by. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Congress will consider proposals to cut off aid to young mothers or 
make them work for their welfare checks. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Pennsylvania sociology Professor Elijah Anderson, who studies 
life in the inner city, confirms that some girls intentionally get pregnant for 
"the check." 
</P>
<P>
 But they aren't the majority of teen mothers he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 More often, he said, girls who grow up surrounded by crime and drugs and 
single moms and out-of-work dads -- girls who dream of marriage and a career 
but don't realistically expect them -- seem to stumble into pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some boys reared in this culture make a sport of getting girls pregnant to 
prove their manhood, Anderson wrote in his book, "Street Wise." 
</P>
<P>
 "So many of the young people lack a sense of future," Anderson said. "I think 
that plays into this willingness to engage in sex and to be careless about 
sexual behavior, to not think about it so much." 
</P>
<P>
 The girls don't plan a life on welfare; they don't plan much of anything. But 
a baby has a dreamy sort of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a familiar story at the Shenandoah Maternity Center, where Dawn and other 
girls from West Virginia's eastern panhandle, most of them white and 
low-income, come for care. 
</P>
<P>
 Some girls are dismayed to be pregnant. The staff suspects others planned it 
to have something to love or in hopes of holding onto a boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the largest group is those who are just ambivalent -- who didn't plan it, 
but don't mind that they are pregnant," said center director Cindy Barr. "And 
they are the ones no one seems to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither sermons on abstinence nor lessons in birth control have gotten through 
to this group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn learned in school about preventing pregnancy and AIDS. She believed in 
using condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a time, shortly after she turned 16, Dawn tried to get pregnant. She 
and her steady boyfriend, David, a 24-year-old who already has a child by 
another woman, had unprotected sex for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had everything planned out, we were going to get married, have a family," 
she said. But when she thought she might be pregnant, they got scared. They 
split up soon after the false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the next man she dated, a relationship that lasted just three months, 
who fathered her child. They didn't bother with birth control. Dawn insists she 
didn't want to get pregnant, and says she suspected she was infertile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, that's not going to happen to me," Dawn said. "And then it 
happened a month later." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she tested positive, Dawn had already broken up with the baby's 
father, a 25-year-old electronics store manager. He pressed for an abortion, 
but she refused. She never considered adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn wanted the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I was scared, but when I sat down and thought about it, it was 
wonderful," she said, a smile lighting up her brown eyes. "I was excited." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sex education is based largely on the notion that teens won't have babies if 
they know where to get contraceptives and how to use them. After all, several 
surveys have found more than 90% of unmarried, pregnant teen-agers say they 
didn't want to get pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet teens who know about birth control keep having babies. And sometimes a 
second or third. 
</P>
<P>
 To explore this contradiction, Laurie S. Zabin, a Johns Hopkins University 
professor of population issues, led a survey of 313 black teen-agers who came 
to an inner city Baltimore clinic for pregnancy tests. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether they wanted to be pregnant, 91% said no. But in answer to 
other questions -- How would you feel if you were pregnant? Would having a baby 
now be a problem for you? -- about half of them expressed ambivalence about 
having a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of two years, the ambivalent girls were just as likely to have a 
baby as the handful of girls who said they wanted to get pregnant. Two-thirds 
of each group gave birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls who unequivocally wanted to avoid pregnancy did better: just over 
one-third of them had a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 If teens had to take a pill every day or use condoms faithfully to get 
pregnant, Zabin suggests, few would do so. But for sexually active teens (about 
half of all girls ages 15 to 19), avoiding pregnancy takes planning and, 
therefore, motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 For many girls, especially among the middle class, the motivation is the 
promise of an education, a career and marriage -- things worth waiting for. 
Family, church, friends and teachers help reinforce these goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what brings young people to family planning services," said Barbara 
Huberman, who leads North Carolina's efforts to curtail teen pregnancy. "They 
have a reason: I don't want to be a parent, I'm going to college, I want to get 
out of this little town, I want to go somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who expect less from life see less harm in getting pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a baby sometimes inspires these girls to improve their lot, often 
with the aid of programs designed to help teen mothers finish high school, get 
job training or go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 But many will never build a stable home for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, a few community programs are trying to motivate poor girls 
-- and teen-age boys -- before they become parents. Most take a whole-life 
approach that emphasizes education and career goals and discourages drinking, 
drugs and premarital sex (while promoting birth control for the sexually 
active). 
</P>
<P>
 But even those who run such teen centers say there is no cure for the cycle of 
entrenched poverty and broken families that produces aimless teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the money you can spend is just a Band-Aid," said Imogene Peterson, 
family services director of The Family Place in Baltimore. "Jobs and futures 
are what our young people need." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks after her baby was born, Dawn returned to the maternity clinic for 
one of the more foolproof birth control methods -- Depo-Provera, a 
contraceptive injection that lasts three months. 
</P>
<P>
 She is dating David again, and hopes they will be married next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 She also is studying for the high school equivalency test and plans to enter a 
computer training program, so she can support Justin alone if she has to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be somebody for him," Dawn said as her baby slept beside her on the 
sofa.

NISEI FOUGHT SECRET WAR OF WORDS; WORLD WAR II: LINGUISTS DRAWN FROM AMERICA'S 
INTERNMENT CAMPS IN THE '40S SERVED IN EVERY MAJOR BATTLE IN THE PACIFIC. THEY 
CULLED CRITICAL INFORMATION FROM JAPANESE CAPTIVES AND THE AIRWAVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE FEINSILBER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half a century ago, the Japanese commanders didn't bother putting many of 
their wartime military communications into code. After all, they knew how 
strange their language looked and sounded to foreign eyes and ears. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Imperial Army didn't know about an American secret weapon during World 
War II, the Military Intelligence Service, 6,000 Japanese-American linguists 
who served in every major battle in the Pacific, from the Aleutians to Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
 They questioned captives for immediate, useful information. They eavesdropped 
on communications between Japanese pilots and their airfields. 
</P>
<P>
 They read poems and diaries taken from the bodies of dead soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Japanese warriors didn't know about the Japanese-American translators, 
neither did the American public. The government pledged them to secrecy; it 
kept records of their service classified for a quarter of a century after the 
war had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Their story is told in a new book, "Honor by Fire," by Lyn Crost, 79, who was 
an Associated Press reporter in Washington when she was hired by the Honolulu 
Star-Bulletin to cover the feats of Hawaii's soldiers in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 There, she became acquainted with the Japanese-American soldiers and has 
maintained those friendships for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she had to work hard to get their adventures from men who, she writes, 
are "so modest that you must drag the stories out of them or hear the accounts 
from others." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific, the 6,000 Nisei -- second-generation Japanese-Americans -- 
"saved over 1 million lives and shortened the war by two years," Maj. Gen. 
Charles Willoughby, intelligence chief for Gen. Douglas MacArthur, estimated in 
a speech years later. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the Nisei linguists translated 20 million captured documents and 
questioned 14,000 prisoners, sometimes wresting surprising information. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to humane treatment from his Japanese-American interrogator, one 
prisoner, a former shipyard worker, drew detailed sketches of every type of 
ship in Japan's navy. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a war front translator could be dangerous work. For soldiers like 
Yoshikazu Yamada it could be doubly dangerous. He was treating American wounded 
when the Japanese attacked an airfield in the Philippines. As he fled, the 
Americans mistook him for the enemy. He found himself ducking fire from both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Nisei linguists served with Allied forces from the United States, Great 
Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and China. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them volunteered -- and some were drafted -- from the internment camps 
to which virtually all West Coast Japanese-Americans were confined by a nervous 
government following the outbreak of war on Dec. 7, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Willoughby, Japanese indifference about security allowed Nisei 
intelligence teams to read captured maps and orders, to learn Japanese troop 
strength and plans of attack and, from diaries and letters and poems, to learn 
the state of morale of Japanese troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other documents indicated the enemy's problems of food and supply, his order 
of battle, the effect of our air attacks, his relations with the natives, the 
relative effectiveness of Allied and Japanese weapons," Willoughby later 
reported. "Spot interrogations of prisoners taken in battle were at times of 
such importance that they caused a shift in Allied plans of attack." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nisei served in the struggle to open the Burma Road to funnel weapons to 
China. In India, they intercepted Japanese radio commands for air strikes. And, 
by a stroke of luck, they were able to provide Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower with a 
description of Germany's defenses that his troops would have to breach when 
they invaded Europe on D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
 That occurred because the Japanese ambassador to Berlin had been given an 
extensive tour of Germany's defenses and promptly sent a description to Tokyo. 
His message was intercepted in Turkey and sent to Virginia, where Nisei 
linguists translated it. Word was then flashed to Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their service, says Crost, the Japanese-Americans are still singed by 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This story must be told," she said. "Americans do not know how hard these men 
fought in a war to keep democracy alive."

SOVIET-ERA IMMIGRANTS TO AMERICA GREET NEWCOMERS WITH SUSPICION; HUMAN 
RELATIONS: THOSE WHO FLED EASTERN EUROPE FOR POLITICAL REASONS SAY NEW ARRIVALS 
ARE SIMPLY OUT TO GET RICH QUICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before communism crumbled, immigrants from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe 
flocked to the United States for freedom and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Today they come for something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you have people who just want to get rich, it doesn't matter how," said 
Ena Ghyka of Arlington, Va., who fled Romania in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different breed, completely different," said Irene Nikitin, 71, of San 
Francisco, a World War II refugee from Kiev. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest wave of immigrants from Russia and her former satellites is getting 
a chilly reception from some of those who came before. 
</P>
<P>
 Communist-era refugees were escaping political or religious persecution, which 
gave their immigrant status a martyr-like glow. They see the newcomers as 
everything from rude to morally bankrupt, lured to the United States by VCRs 
and fast cars. And they hold the Iron Curtain responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people on top of the social pyramid were stealing -- there was no 
morality. Everybody was stealing, everybody was cheating. For years it became a 
habit, built into their nervous system," said Andrew Kawecki, 58, a staff 
writer for the Polish Daily News in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawecki said he had the same "bad habits" to break when he came from Poland 20 
years ago, but it may be harder for those who lived that way longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some newcomers are cheating everyone from IRS to friends," Kawecki said. 
"They wouldn't obey the rules. . . . They are destroyed from the inside. And 
it's not their fault. It's the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers don't deny a communist society left a mark on its people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were as blind cats in the former Soviet Union because we believed in 
communism and other things," said Lyba Mikityanskaya, who arrived from Ukraine 
last year. "Now we come to this country and we see we were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 But they point out that life has gotten harder in the former Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe, with anti-Semitism, crime and ethnic clashes on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are coming now are much more like refugees, escaping a war zone," 
said Vladimir Vishnevskiy, 36, who came from Russia 3 1/2 years ago. "People 
who came before were like prisoners escaping prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they long for a better life, he said. And why shouldn't they? 
</P>
<P>
 Friction between the old guard and newcomers is nothing new in this country of 
immigrants, said Arthur Helton, director of migration programs at the Open 
Society Institute. Those who settled on the Lower East Side of Manhattan at the 
turn of the century, for example, were "reviled and demonized" by other 
Americans, including those who came before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a fierce ideological conflict, now as dead as the Cold War and the "evil 
empire," makes this situation unique in recent immigrant history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difference between people who are brought up under a totalitarian, 
communist, paternalistic system and those who have absolutely no knowledge of 
that kind of system," said Pauline Bilus, head of Action for Russian 
Immigrants, a resettlement program in Brighton Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking primarily about a 70- to 75-year gap -- or what I call a black 
hole -- of people who have lived under this totalitarian system. This great 
experiment that became a dismal failure." 
</P>
<P>
 So dismal that many people didn't want to stay to pick up the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration to the United States from the region has increased sharply since 
the Iron Curtain rose. Immigrants admitted from former Soviet republics alone 
went from 11,100 in 1989 to 58,500 in 1993, according to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service.

HIGH RISK IS OUT OF PLACE IN MANAGING PENSION FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County is in bankruptcy, a headline on Dec. 7 states that "20,000 
Nationwide Invested in Phony Retirement Plans," and a few days earlier another 
headline proclaimed that the private pension funds of this country's private 
corporations were short billions of dollars of what they should have in their 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who accept the concept that such risk in finances is an unfortunate 
but unavoidable part of our "free enterprise system," such gambles may be 
acceptable but these risks are totally unacceptable to those who are trying to 
put aside savings for retirement or who are already retired and hoping to 
budget their assets for their needs now that they are no longer able to work. 
The news from Orange County indicates that such a risk approach to the handling 
of government and certain corporate funds is also destabilizing and also may no 
longer be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County experience shows that government funds, including bond 
funds, pension funds for employees, operating budget funds, etc., must not be 
left to the mercy of the securities market and the judgment of financial 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 The message that is crying out loudly by the above developments is that there 
is the need for the establishment of a category of "retirement quality 
securities" that can be used by those saving for retirement, those handling 
trust funds or any other funds that cannot be put at risk and are not 
adequately serviced by banks, that can be used by such funds with the assurance 
of safety. Such "retirement quality securities" might have to forgo the 
possibility of speculative long-term growth but would offer a modest earning 
assurance over the long run. Such "retirement quality securities" would provide 
a secure haven for corporate retirement funds that would give employees the 
assurance that their pensions earned over a lifetime of work would be there 
when needed, and such investment possibilities would relieve government 
entities of the danger that their funds would suffer the same fate as what 
occurred with Orange County funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Our country has ignored for too long the need for there to be available such 
an especially regulated section of the securities market. This may have been 
tolerable in the past. With the explosive growth of the retirement population, 
such relaxed approach is no longer tolerable for the private sector and, as 
Orange County shows, is no longer tolerable with government and trust funds. 
Continued ignoring of this problem must end. The public has a right to insist 
on immediate correction.

FOREIGN AID IS 'MOST UNNECESSARY' EXPENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I very much appreciated Robert Rosenblatt's attempt to pare down the budget 
("Play the Budget-Buster Sweepstakes With GOP'S Contract Plan," Dec. 4), 
especially the listing of some of the items we the taxpayers shell out for, and 
explanations accompanying. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I'd slash them all! 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosenblatt failed to mention the most unnecessary budget item of all, 
which is among the biggest: foreign aid, which I understand amounts to over $12 
billion per year. That makes for $60 billion in five years -- more than a third 
of the target. 
</P>
<P>
 Most citizens are ignorant to the fact that they are giving their money to 
non-Americans of every sort of political denomination. Those that are not 
ignorant to this fact are absolutely against it, unless they are passionate to 
special-interest groups. It seems to me that with the Cold War over and no 
apparent enemy, the U.S. doesn't need to pander to strategically beneficial 
countries or assist countries with Communist leanings. It's certainly neither 
sensible nor practical to go into debt to assist foreign countries.

BUDGET PREMISE BASED ON FLAWED COMPARISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to comment on Robert Eisner's commentary ("Balanced-Budget Amendment 
Would Spell Disaster for Economy," Dec. 11) declaring that not only is a 
balanced federal budget unlikely to happen, but it makes terrible economics to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's premise is based on a flawed comparison to normal household borrowing 
such as a home mortgage or a college education. The federal government is an 
ongoing concern that will operate for many generations to come. A household 
purchasing a house will obtain benefits during and beyond the period when the 
mortgage is paid off, usually 15 to 30 years. A prudent household would not, 
however, borrow money for consumables, such as groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 If one were to borrow funds for a year to cover a week's worth of groceries, 
the interest payments on this debt would quickly outweigh the weekly cost of 
groceries. For the first few weeks, the cash flow would be advantageous; 
however, after a few more weeks, the cost of the interest will exceed the 
weekly cost of groceries, and the need for groceries will still be there. It is 
wiser to simply pay for them out of normal cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner compares the federal government with a household, ignoring the fact 
that much of what the government is borrowing is not for goods that will return 
long-term value, but for normal recurring operating expenses, much like a 
household's groceries. Federal spending on recurring expenses, such as Social 
Security, military operating expenses (not R&D), entitlements, etc., must be 
treated as operating expenses with known revenue to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner further states the hopelessness of controlling federal spending by 
comparing it to the waves of the Pacific Ocean. Hogwash. Our system elects 
executives to make those crucial decisions and produce a realistic budget and 
operating plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Federal spending is the one item that most legislators do best. But they are 
empowered to choose how to spend, not just spend without regard to financial 
responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 A balanced budget is a necessity for the long-term stability of our economy. 
Unfortunately, it is easier in our political system to put it off to the next 
term than to deal with this problem head-on.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: IT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAID, BUT HOW

<P>
 Is the mood of the people such that an episode of a prime-time sitcom built 
around masturbation can win big ratings and awards, while political appointees 
who discuss its relevance to sex education get canned? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Jerry Seinfeld scored big with last year's show about who could go the 
longest without resorting to, well, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 And true, Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders got fired because she suggested 
earlier this month at an AIDS conference that masturbation is "a part of human 
sexuality" and "a part of something that perhaps should be taught." 
</P>
<P>
 But Elders' remark was merely the last straw on the back of a political camel 
named Bill, whose knees were already weakened with the unexpected weight of 
some heavy midterm election baggage. The already staggering Clinton really had 
no choice in his effort to placate the Right; Elders had to go. 
</P>
<P>
 In firing Elders, however, the President did something that no casual answer 
to a question about AIDS prevention could. 
</P>
<P>
 He put masturbation on the front page. Way to go, Bill.  
</P>
<P>
 As the mother of a toddler who has lately been experimenting with her large 
collection of stuffed animals, I am somewhat relieved. It's nice to know I am 
not the only adult in America thinking about teaching children about 
masturbation, which on reflection is rather like teaching them about candy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they discover candy, they are rather prone to like it. It's just that you 
want them to eat it at the appropriate times. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When the news of Elders' firing hit the media last week, Debra Haffner began 
receiving calls from friends whose kids were suddenly asking about 
masturbation. 
</P>
<P>
 Haffner is executive director of the Sexuality Education and Information 
Council of the United States, a 30-year-old New York-based information 
clearinghouse and advocacy organization for individual sexual rights. 
</P>
<P>
 What, asked Haffner's friends, should they tell the kids? 
</P>
<P>
 "What I told them to say was that touching your own genitals is called 
masturbation and that some boys and girls do it and some do not." 
</P>
<P>
 Simple. Uncomplicated. And hardly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor should it be surprising that parents are at sea on this and have to ask 
for help. This is why most states have sex education curriculum, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is what many sex educators think schoolchildren should know about 
masturbation: 
</P>
<P>
 * It is one way for people to express their sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 * It is a way to give sexual pleasure without risking disease or pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most people will do it at some point. 
</P>
<P>
 * Doing it or not doing it are both healthy choices. 
</P>
<P>
 * It does not cause physical or mental harm. 
</P>
<P>
 * Single and married people do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * It is a controversial topic and some people disapprove for religious 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Your palms will not grow hair if you do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nor will you go blind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to recognize that when both 'Roseanne' and 'Seinfeld' dealt 
with the issue this year, their ratings went up, but when a federal official 
talked about it, she got fired," Haffner says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an issue that is not talked about in the popular culture. But the 
word itself is so loaded. Maybe if Elders had said, 'Master of His Domain' (as 
masturbation was referred to in the Emmy-winning 'Seinfeld' episode), this 
would not have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Little sex-educator joke there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Masturbation may not be fodder for conversation at most dinner tables in 
America, but it is certainly widely practiced. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the much-publicized sex survey published by University of Chicago 
researchers last fall, about 60% of men and 40% of women admitted to 
masturbating occasionally or frequently. (And what to make of these tidbits? 
The greater a person's education and salary, the more likely they were to say 
they do it. And the only issue people were less comfortable discussing than 
masturbation was how much money they make.)  
</P>
<P>
 Pepper Schwartz, a professor of sociology at the University of Washington, 
Seattle, has studied human sexuality for many years and finds it "both humorous 
and pitiful" that Americans are still talking about whether masturbation "is a 
good thing, or a moral thing, or whether this should be discussed in polite 
company. It feels good, and we are a pretty Puritanical society, so we are not 
so sure that feeling good is such a great idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Sort of like candy. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone loves it, but nobody wants to admit how much.

APPLAUSE FOR AN INFORMATIVE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A great many thanks for "A Crucial Connection" (Dec. 9), which truly informs 
and enlightens the public about the abuse of deaf children in hearing families. 
Also thanks to the writer, Bettijane Levine, for producing a well-balanced and 
bias-free article. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never experienced such abuse myself. I am deaf and have used sign 
language all my life with my deaf family. I have never had frustration in 
expressing myself or in understanding my parents. This has played an important 
role in my identity and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 With full communication, I also was able to learn some skills in speaking and 
lip reading, which have come in handy only sometimes (nothing is guaranteed). I 
could go through a regular public high school and college for the deaf, earning 
a B.A. I've had various jobs with both hearing and deaf people. 
</P>
<P>
 The points made by Rick Mitchell and Kristin Murphy, counselors at Five Acres, 
are unquestionably valid. Just to reiterate to all parents with a deaf child: 
Learn and communicate in sign language. It will save a lot of problems.

WESTSIDE WATCH: STORE IS A GIFT TROVE FOR MOVIE BUFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For that hard-to-shop-for person on your Christmas list, how about giving the 
gift of gaffer's tape? 
</P>
<P>
 The sticky stuff used by a gaffer (the head electrician on a movie set) is 
yours for just $12 at the newly opened MGM Studio Store in Santa Monica, in 
MGM's Colorado Boulevard corporate headquarters building. 
</P>
<P>
 If that doesn't work for you, how about a beeper cover with the MGM logo for 
$10 or a ditty bag for $60, just like the one used by movie grips to carry 
their tools? 
</P>
<P>
 These three items are hot sellers at the new store, which is designed to 
resemble a studio back lot, said NancyJane Goldston, vice president of 
licensing and merchandising for MGM/United Artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Other products include crew jackets, mugs, caps, leather manuscript bags, Pink 
Panther dolls and just about everything else one could stick a logo on. 
</P>
<P>
 The five Oscars on display are, alas, not for sale.

 "A" FOR EFFORT: We've heard of popping little pink heart-shaped pills and 
staying up all night to get a semester's worth of reading done in 12 hours, but 
one UCLA student has been accused of taking finals frenzy a step too far. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Los Angeles city attorney's office, the student was spotted 
using a master key to enter his professor's office shortly after midnight on 
the morning of the final exam in Economics 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness? The professor himself, who had been working late. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his account, the two spoke for a few minutes. Then the student 
went off, leaving the master key and a false name. 
</P>
<P>
 During the final later that day, the professor spotted the student in class 
and called campus police, who took him into custody and charged him with one 
count of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Identified as Noah Ram Balch, 19, a native of Carlsbad and a resident of the 
Westwood campus, he was being held at the West Hollywood sheriff's station 
pending $15,000 bail.

 UNDER FIRE: Poor Brentwood. The leafy residential district, subject of a

 And found wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 "One sees a certain blankness in the eyes you meet on the street," according 
to a cover story in the Dec. 19 issue. "It is as if personal histories -- 
narratives -- have been cashed in like frequent-flyer points that went toward 
unsuccessful vacations."

 There is a sense of Paradise lost, or at least misplaced, in the article by

San Vicente Boulevard.

 The piece, inspired by the violent death of Nicole Brown Simpson -- isn't 
everything? -- does not fail to summon up the tired ghost of Marilyn Monroe, 
who also lived and died in ZIP code 90049. Her bedroom was messy, we learn.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT; EDUCATION: FREE BREAKFASTS ARE A MAINSTAY FOR MANY AREA 
STUDENTS. BUT THE PROGRAM HAS FAILED AT OTHER SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF LOW DEMAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Government-subsidized breakfasts aren't on the table in all Westside schools. 
In Beverly Hills schools and on some Santa Monica and Malibu campuses, 
officials say the demand for free and low-cost breakfasts is so meager that the 
programs can't be justified. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the case throughout the Westside. All Los Angeles Unified 
schools on the Westside offer subsidized breakfasts -- even those in Pacific 
Palisades, where the program serves youths bused from low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District, free and reduced-cost 
breakfasts are offered at four elementary schools, a middle school and both 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And last month, Culver City Unified applied for a federal grant to start a 
breakfast program at La Ballona Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 The availability of school breakfasts has become a hot topic amid recent 
reports in The Times of hungry schoolchildren in suburbia. State officials say 
the reports have helped spur unusually heavy demand by schools to receive 
breakfast subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Any school can offer a subsidized breakfast program. Currently, the government 
offers a special incentive -- a higher reimbursement rate -- to "severe need" 
schools, those with 40% or more low-income children. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, officials say that in some schools, breakfast programs have 
been a flop. Until three years ago, Culver City offered subsidized breakfasts 
in all its schools, but the program was cut back because demand was low and the 
breakfasts -- though partly funded by the government -- were costing the 
district $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was low participation," said James Crawford, the district's director of 
business services. "People realized it wasn't operating efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 That is not expected to be the case at La Ballona. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Dale Petrulis said that while discussing ways to improve student 
health care, parents, teachers and administrators agreed there was a great need 
for a breakfast program at La Ballona, where nearly half of the 485 students 
qualify for free and reduced-cost breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakfast program at La Ballona, Crawford said, is scheduled to start by 
the end of January, pending approval of the grant by federal officials and 
final approval of the program by the school board. The school board is 
scheduled to discuss the matter Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica/Malibu Unified, almost half of the district's nearly 10,000 
students are eligible for free and reduced-price breakfasts, said Rodney 
Taylor, the district's food services director. But only about 700 students take 
advantage of the breakfast program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor says that in some schools there is simply a lack of interest among 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Muir Elementary, only 40 kids eat breakfast," Taylor said. "That (low 
participation) doesn't justify the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor acknowledges that one can argue that the program is justified because 
it keeps 40 children from going hungry in the school, where 175 students are 
eligible for the breakfasts out of an enrollment of 341. 
</P>
<P>
 But he says school districts must also keep costs in mind. One potentially 
high cost of offering the breakfasts, he said, is giving full-time jobs to food 
service employees now working on a part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need more labor to supervise breakfast," he said. "(District officials) 
don't want to hear that we lost $60,000 running a breakfast program. That money 
could go toward instructional materials." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Santa Monica/Malibu, as in Culver City, there are places where the 
demand for free and low-price breakfasts is strong. Edison Elementary, where 
85% of the students qualify for free or reduced-price breakfasts, has the 
highest breakfast program participation in the district -- 300 students out of 
a total enrollment of 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said he wishes more students in the other schools would take advantage 
of the breakfast program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent letters home, in English and Spanish, that explain the breakfast 
program, explaining that kids learn better with breakfast," said Taylor, who 
has been at Santa Monica/Malibu two years. While participation has improved in 
the last two years, he said, "I'm still not excited about the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 He cites several possible reasons for the low turnout. Some school buses don't 
arrive on campuses in time for the breakfasts, which start at 8 a.m., and in 
some cases kids balk at the menu.

REPORT CALLING SANTA MONICA 'MEAN' TO HOMELESS IRKS OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years after being dubbed "Skid Row by the Sea" for its tolerant policies 
toward the homeless, Santa Monica has turned up on a national homeless advocacy 
group's list as having among the "meanest streets" in America. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials swiftly rejected the characterization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's ridiculous," said newly elected Santa Monica Mayor Paul 
Rosenstein. "Our policies are very humane -- tough, but humane." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert T. Holbrook said the advocacy group was trying to embarrass 
Santa Monica because it has chosen to balance its generous homeless programs 
with efforts to make the city more livable for the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want us to run our city the way they (would)," Holbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica was one of five cities singled out by The National Law Center on 
Homelessness and Poverty in Washington D.C. for alleged anti-homeless policies. 
The other four "worst" cities named by the group are Cleveland, San Francisco, 
Santa Ana and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings were part of a 49-city analysis of how municipalities are dealing 
with transients. The findings were released in Washington on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica merited special mention from the group because of a series of 
laws passed in the last two years aimed at preventing homeless people from 
living in city parks and tightening rules against aggressive panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also mentions a law that regulates people who give out free food in 
parks by requiring them to meet county health code regulations. In a factual 
error, the report says the Santa Monica City Council voted to put a cap on 
spending for homeless services. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there is no spending cap, though some have proposed one. Santa 
Monica spends about $1.4 million each year on homeless services. This year the 
city opened a 100-bed shelter as part of a shift in strategy away from 
emergency services and toward programs that have the goal of getting people off 
the street permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more humane to help people rebuild their lives than to help people live 
in misery on the streets," said Rosenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing Mayor Judy Abdo, who voted against most of the new restrictions, also 
was critical of the group for dubbing Santa Monica's streets as "mean." 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Monica continues to spend more per capita on homeless programs than 
nearly any place in the country and continues to present a balanced approach to 
homeless issues," Abdo said. 
</P>
<P>
 While also disagreeing with some of the recent measures enacted by the City 
Council, the director of the Ocean Park Community Center, which provides 
homeless services, said Santa Monica's programs must be viewed as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has maintained a fairly high level of services," director Vivian 
Rothstein said. "No one in the city believes sleeping outside is a solution to 
homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Maria Foscarinis, the executive director of the National Law Center 
on Homelessness and Poverty, said the Santa Monica measures were clearly 
designed to "drive homeless people out of town. . . . There are no public 
places where homeless people can sleep. They've created a situation where 
homeless people literally cannot stay in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Foscarinis said politicians in Santa Monica, as in other cities, had succumbed 
to a "knee-jerk reaction" to make it appear they were addressing the problem 
when in fact they are criminalizing poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Her assessment was supported by former Santa Monica City Atty. Robert M. 
Myers, who was fired for refusing to go along with the City Council's effort to 
change its policy toward the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear the city has made a concerted effort to make life as hard as 
possible for the homeless," Myers said. "It is certainly a monumental 
accomplishment that the Santa Monicans for Renters Rights (controlled) City 
Council can be proud of," he added sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
 Others disagreed. Susan Dempsay said Santa Monica should be commended, not 
scorned, for grappling with the problem, in contrast to other cities that 
pretend it doesn't exist. Dempsay runs Step Up on Second, which recently added 
permanent housing to its array of services for homeless mentally ill people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Monica knows it has a problem and is trying to solve it," Dempsay said. 
"Beverly Hills, on the other hand, ignores the fact there are homeless people 
anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsay also said she supports local efforts to set standards for homeless 
people. "Every individual, including those with mental illnesses and substance 
abuse problems, has a responsibility to be a good citizen and do the best they 
can," she said.

MALIBU SEEKS MAINTENANCE FUNDS FOR PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Malibu officials are exploring ways to raise $125,000 a year for maintenance 
of Surfrider Beach as part of a deal under which the city would receive $2.9 
million in county funds for renovation of the Malibu Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last month rejected a proposal by former County Supervisor Ed 
Edelman to use city funds to cover the yearly maintenance cost. Malibu city 
staff was subsequently directed to initiate negotiations with the state and 
county to seek alternative sources for the funds. The City Council plans to 
revisit the issue in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to do everything we can do to find a way to get that $3 million 
to the pier," said Mayor Jeffrey W. Kramer. "It is one of our most visible 
landmarks. We do know that we can't take money from our ($7 million) General 
Fund." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the alternatives under consideration are soliciting the business 
community for the maintenance cost or attempting to raise the amount through 
private donations, Kramer said. Another possibility is forging a deal with the 
state to channel a percentage of the pier's revenues from concessionaires and 
parking to cover beach maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The details are still being worked out," said Malibu City Manager David N. 
Carmany. "It's like a forward pass in football; there are a number of potential 
different outcomes. Word I hear from my colleagues in other cities is that 
piers cost money, they don't make money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu Township Council, a community group that spearheaded Malibu's 
cityhood movement more than three years ago, has advocated culling the money 
from rents generated by businesses on the state-owned pier. The group also has 
proposed creating a nonprofit organization to raise funds to maintain the 
dilapidated pier and establish a marine museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Current stores on the pier are a bait-and-tackle shop, a sport-fishing 
business and Alice's Restaurant. The state tried to evict Alice's Restaurant, a 
Malibu dining institution since 1972 and the pier's main concessionaire, for 
unpaid back rent, but the restaurant failed to vacate. The state, in turn, sued 
Japedemy Inc., the restaurant's owner. A trial is scheduled for Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Yuro, a co-owner of the restaurant, has claimed in the past that he has 
withheld rent because the state reneged on a promise to apply rents to renovate 
the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement to provide $2.9 million to renovate the pier was part of a 
complicated deal brokered by Edelman during his final County Board of 
Supervisors meeting on Dec. 1. Edelman ushered through three proposals, 
estimated at more than $7 million, to improve Westside beaches, all within his 
Third District. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition A funds, approved by voters two years ago for the improvement of 
county parks and open spaces, will be used to pay for the projects. Of the 
remaining funds, an estimated $1.5 million will go for construction and repair 
of facilities at Venice Beach, and about $3 million will be used for renovation 
and construction of facilities at Zuma Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the Malibu Pier is owned by the state, Edelman had to find a legal 
way to get around a requirement that county funds be spent only on county 
projects. Edelman proposed a deal in which the state would lease the 
89-year-old pier to the county, and the pier would be maintained by the city of 
Malibu.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; RESIDENTS SEEKING TRAFFIC MITIGATION PICKET 
COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustrated that their area's traffic plan had been stalled, dozens of Sunset 
Park residents created a little gridlock of their own last week by holding a 
protest march in the City Council chambers and temporarily halting the council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Equipped with signs and a bullhorn, the Friends of Sunset Park, a residents' 
association, rallied on the City Hall lawn, then marched into the council 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Sunset Park had been angered by the council's rejection of a 
traffic mitigation plan that supporters hoped would ease commuter traffic in 
the southeast section of the city. The council voted last month to oppose the 
controversial plan, which would have included 24-hour turn restrictions along 
Pico and Ocean Park boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had initially supported the traffic plan after it was endorsed by 
Friends of Sunset Park and a second residents group, the Sunset Park Assn. of 
Neighbors (SPAN). SPAN, however, decided to oppose the traffic plan and 
successfully lobbied the council to oppose its funding last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters from Friends of Sunset Park carried signs into the council chambers 
last week reading "Council keep your promises!" and "No more delays, action 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Newly elected Mayor Paul Rosenstein said he later discovered that the march 
inside the council chambers was in violation of the council rules, but that he 
did not object. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like that is relatively rare in Santa Monica," Rosenstein said. 
"But people have the right to express their feelings, and I don't mind as long 
as they don't do anything that is destructive." SUSAN STEINBERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; SANTA MONICA HOSPITAL WEIGHS SALE, MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center is considering merging with or selling 
the facility to either St. John's Hospital and Health Center or UCLA Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Braun, a spokesman for Santa Monica Hospital, confirmed that UniHealth, 
the facility's parent company, has been talking to UCLA Medical Center since 
June about a possible affiliation. Santa Monica Hospital has also continued 
discussions with St. John's Hospital about an affiliation, and hospital 
officials expect a development in the talks by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is on the table," said Ross K. Goldberg, vice president of 
corporate communications for UniHealth, a Burbank-based nonprofit health 
corporation that also owns California Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last eight to nine months, discussions have been unfolding . . . 
including talk of affiliations, cooperative ventures and sale" of the facility, 
Goldberg said. "We are trying to determine whether or not it is more 
advantageous to the community to be affiliated with St. John's or UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between St. John's and Santa Monica hospitals began soon after the 
Northridge earthquake effectively closed inpatient services at St. John's 
Hospital for nine months. St. John's reopened in October, with its inpatient 
capacity reduced from 501 beds to 260. Santa Monica Hospital also sustained 
considerable damage in the quake, temporarily losing 80 of its 280 inpatient 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while both facilities were repairing and reassessing their inpatient 
capacities that the rival hospitals considered affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Laret, chief executive officer of UCLA Medical Group and deputy director 
of UCLA Medical Center, said the Westwood facility entered into talks with 
UniHealth after it became clear that an affiliation could be formed between the 
two Santa Monica facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that, particularly with UCLA doctors, we could create a health-care 
system that would be very appealing to HMOs and other payers," Laret said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-care experts said the resulting tug-of-war between the facilities was a 
byproduct of a rapidly changing health-care market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Westside hospital market is very intensely competitive," said David 
Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California. "The 
outcome of these negotiations that are going on between these Westside 
hospitals, (which are) all jockeying for market penetration and positioning, 
will influence health-care delivery on the Westside for years to come."

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * WILSHIRE ZONING CHANGE -- Approved a zoning change limiting the size of 
buildings along Wilshire Boulevard between Fairfax Avenue and the Beverly Hills 
city limits. The impetus for the change was a planned 19-story building on 
Wilshire at La Jolla Avenue that sparked outrage from residents of neighboring 
6th Street, who complained that the structure would block much of their 
sunlight. The building will be redesigned as a tapered, 14-story structure with 
emphasis on limiting light blockage to nearby properties. 
</P>
<P>
 * APARTMENT REJECTED -- Approved a Planning and Land Use Management Committee 
report that rejected a zoning change needed for construction of a 110-unit 
apartment complex at 7555 S. Sepulveda Blvd. About 150 neighborhood residents 
have spoken out against the complex, contending that it would adversely affect 
traffic in the already congested area near the San Diego (405) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFERED -- Approved a $10,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of those responsible for the disappearance of Katrina 
Montgomery, who left Oxnard on Nov. 28, 1992, but never arrived at her home in 
Westchester. Her truck was later found off Little Tujunga Canyon Road in the 
Angeles National Forest with bloodstains in the vehicle. Police say the have 
exhausted all leads in the case. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * RECYCLING DISPUTE -- Sustained a decision by zoning officials that imposes 
several operating conditions on a recycling center at 711-717 Cahuenga Blvd. 
that has been declared a public nuisance. Several residents of the area, 
including spokesmen for the Hancock Park and Windsor Square homeowners 
associations, complained of the glass-crushing noise generated by Hollywood 
Recycling. They also said the center serves as a magnet for homeless people 
with shopping carts, who often urinate in public and invade their back yards 
and garages in search of cans and bottles. The center's owner, Jess Underberg, 
countered that just 10% of his customers are homeless and that the center 
provides a important service by processing about 600,000 pounds of recyclables 
a month. To stay open, the center must construct an enclosed building for 
crushing work and build a 6-foot concrete wall topped with 2 feet of chain link 
around the complex. In addition, material cannot be accepted if delivered in 
shopping carts or similar devices. Underberg, the center's owner, said the cost 
of these conditions may force him out of business. Passed 11-0. Voting yes: 
Marvin Braude, John Ferraro, Ruth Galanter, Jackie Goldberg, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas. Absent: Nate Holden. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; AGAINST THE WIND; TO LAND A SPOT ON THE FIRST ALL-FEMALE 
AMERICA'S CUP TEAM, 26-YEAR-OLD SHELLEY BEATTIE OVERCAME NEAR-TOTAL DEAFNESS 
AND A LACK OF SAILING EXPERIENCE. HER TACK: STRENGTH, POISE AND FIGHTING 
DETERMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viewers of the "American Gladiators" television show probably look on Shelley 
Beattie with envy. As "Siren," one of the show's muscular competitors who 
battle contestants in feats of strength and skill, she seemingly has it all -- 
the physique of a champion bodybuilder, the looks to attract an audience and 
the determination to be a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Beattie, a Malibu resident, is turning heads on the sailing circuit. 
Despite having no previous sailing experience, she has secured a spot on the 
first all-female sailing team to compete for yacht racing's pinnacle -- the 
144-year-old America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 She will be aboard America3, one of three U.S. yachts entered in the 
competition, which gets under way Jan. 12 in San Diego. She has been designated 
one of five "grinders" -- crew members who use muscle power to raise, lower and 
change the direction of sails that measure 4,500 square feet and develop 
several thousand pounds of pressure in strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie's achievements are impressive in themselves, but her background makes 
them remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 6, doctors found she had a hearing problem. Now, at 26, she's 
nearly 100% hearing-impaired. Her parents, unable to cope with her difficult 
teen-age years, put her in foster care, where she languished in three homes 
with no special provisions for her disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Though often confused and alone during those years, Beattie emerged from a 
shell of shyness and began using her disability as a motivation for winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get put down so much growing up that you acquire a survival instinct," 
she says. "Don't tell me I can't, because I will show you I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie has exhibited such grit from an early age. Blessed as a natural 
athlete who found security in sports, she excelled in track in high school and 
later developed an interest in weightlifting. She wound up on the professional 
bodybuilding circuit and in 1990 won the USA Champion contest. She went on to 
earn titles in the Ms. International and Ms. Olympia competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 That led in 1992 to her most visible role -- that of the muscular, 
supercharged "Siren" on "American Gladiators." Typically dressed in a 
red-white-and-blue spandex outfit that reveals every sinewy line on her 
5-foot-7, 150-pound body, she competes against both genders -- effortlessly, it 
seems -- climbing a 35-foot wall, suspended 20 feet in the air from a harness 
or sparring with a pugil stick from a seven-foot-high platform. 
</P>
<P>
 During her third season of taping "American Gladiators," Beattie's husband and 
manager, Jon Romano, heard about openings for America's Cup crew members and 
encouraged her to apply, despite her lack of yachting experience. "He believes 
in me probably more than I do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With an open slot in her schedule -- after completing the "American 
Gladiators" season and before promoting her new Gold's Gym facility in Puerto 
Vallarta, Mexico, which is under construction -- she decided to take her 
husband's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nowhere near what I thought I'd be doing next," Beattie said of the 
America's Cup competition. "It just came up and I grabbed the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as easy at that, however. Beattie was merely one of 600 women 
athletes who applied for a chance to participate in sailing's greatest event. 
She knew it was a long shot, akin to a second-string running back trying out 
for a spot in the backfield of a Super Bowl team. But she made it into the 
group of 50 invited to three grueling, weeklong tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
 When the team lineup was announced last June, Beattie's name was on the list 
with 25 others whose backgrounds included sailing, weightlifting and rowing. 
Sixteen team members are on the yacht at any one time, with 10 reserves. As a 
grinder, Beattie will always be on board. 
</P>
<P>
 After taping the final "American Gladiators" segment for the 1994 season, she 
left Malibu for training camp in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 As taxing as the tryouts were, the struggle in many respects had just begun 
when Beattie arrived at camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie first had to learn the basics of seamanship. A native of rural 
Monmouth, Ore., her exposure to the sea was limited before she moved to 
Southern California after graduating from Western Oregon State University. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned yachting skills and was coached in the mechanics of being a 
grinder. That job revolves around a pedestal winch, which provides the 
mechanical power needed to pull in a series of boa constrictor-sized lines used 
to control the sails. With arms rotating like a bicyclist's legs, she may 
perform the task more than 100 times during a tacking duel against an opposing 
yacht. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effort is comparable to sprinting 50 meters on a track 30 times, with 20 
seconds' rest between each sprint," said grinder Stephanie Armitage Johnson, a 
world-class weightlifter and assistant strength coach for the University of 
Washington football team. Armitage Johnson is one of Beattie's grinding 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that doesn't include the daily gym workouts, beginning at 6:30 a.m., to 
improve strength and endurance. Then there are the long days on the water, the 
labor-intensive chores that include stripping the $5-million, 75-foot racing 
machine of its electronic gear and enormous sails -- it requires at least eight 
women to carry a sail -- and the seemingly endless team meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The team aspect proved most difficult for Beattie. From her early days as a 
bodybuilder, she had been a solo competitor, depending only on herself for 
success. Though she earns points for a team during "American Gladiators" shows, 
she, like the other gladiators, takes on opponents one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
 For a hearing person who has never been on a team, suddenly becoming part of a 
group effort is difficult enough. For a hearing-impaired person it is still 
harder, because teamwork involves communication among the group's members. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated because her hearing impairment made it difficult to understand the 
game plan, Beattie nearly quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going crazy holding in so much anger -- I want to like people and want 
them to help me understand what's going on," Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she found ways to cope. She asked the coaching staff to provide her with a 
sign language translator for team meetings. She has also begun teaching 
teammates to communicate with her through touching and gestures -- especially 
her grinding partners, who help Beattie respond at the appropriate time with 
hand signals and facial expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie's efforts and attitude have not gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said teammate Amy Baltzell, who has become Beattie's close friend: "It is such 
an honor to work with someone who not only has to struggle with a hearing 
impairment but is an incredible athlete with such love in her heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Beattie has contributed to the success of the team, which in 
November placed second in the 1994 International America's Cup Class World 
Championship. Along with the winning team from Australia, the regatta attracted 
all-male teams from the United States, Japan and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 More significant than placing second, America3 beat the other two U.S. cup 
contenders, including the Stars and Stripes, skippered by three-time America's 
Cup winner Dennis Conner. 
</P>
<P>
 With the trials just weeks away, the team is now training 12 hours a day, 
seven days a week to prepare for the 1995 America's Cup race. Bodies are tired 
and nerves are frayed, but Beattie and her teammates say they are determined to 
win the America's Cup, especially for Bill Koch, the multimillionaire and 
former America's Cup winner who founded the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know he believes in us -- we're his family," Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch, who won the cup in 1992, is proud of Beattie and calls her impact on the 
team a "net plus." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has some sort of disadvantage; it's just not as obvious as being 
deaf or blind," he said. "Shelley's deafness is offset by her determination, 
physical ability and good attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Beattie says, she finds it rewarding to break new ground for 
women, for the hearing-impaired -- and for herself. Said Beattie: "I feel that 
I'm growing as a person and learning for the first time to accept myself in 
front of others."

FOR SENIORS; FUND-RAISING WHIZ KEEPS CLINIC IN HEALTHY CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the house that Irma built. Actually, it's the clinic that Irma built -- 
and it's the largest free clinic in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't pour the cement or drive in the nails at the Venice Family Clinic, 
but she might as well have. Irma Colen knows what it takes to make dreams come 
true -- hard work and giving of yourself without expecting anything back. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a Rolodex with 30 years' worth of generous friends and people in high 
places also helps. So does a lot of heart and the kind of compassion that comes 
from going through personal hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 Colen, 73, grew up poor in Chicago. Though the people around her suffered from 
economic despair, she said, they believed in the idealism that promised a 
better world for the good of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my mother standing in the park near our house selling potato 
latkes for a nickel but never turning anyone away who was hungry. In those 
days, neither did anyone else we knew," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Colen was 12, she developed rheumatic fever. Because her family was 
indigent, she was placed in a hospital charity ward. She spent the following 
year attending a school for children with physical disabilities. "I remember 
feeling that if I was to get well it would be because the people taking care of 
me truly cared about my health," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of being poor, sick and completely dependent on the goodwill of 
others influenced her decision to save the Venice Family Clinic from closure 16 
years ago. "My husband, Lou, and I were on a cruise, and I met a young 
physician's assistant, and she told me about this little clinic where she 
worked in Venice, and that it was on the verge of closing for lack of funding," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colen was already experienced at raising money for political candidates and 
causes, but she had no experience in the nonprofit area. "At first, I was too 
busy, so I would tell the clinic's board what to do, but nothing happened," she 
said. "Then I changed my approach and decided that doing the fund raising 
myself and using the Robin Hood theory was the only way to save the clinic." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Colen save the clinic, she made it prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irma Colen can be credited with raising $15 million since she's been 
associated with the clinic," said the clinic's executive director, Elizabeth 
Benson Forer. "Without her, we would not be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither would Parents Without Partners, an organization she founded while 
supporting two children on her own before remarrying in 1965. For 11 tough 
years prior to that, Colen was single and in dire financial straits. 
</P>
<P>
 She created the group because she didn't want her children to feel isolated, 
she said, and she wanted people like herself to meet others in the same 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 That situation ended when she met Lou. But it was far from a Cinderella story. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was definitely the most eligible man around, and he enjoyed that status," 
she said. "When I realized I was in love with him, I told him either it was 
only me or we could just be friends. It took a year before he proposed." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Venice Family Clinic's Irma and Lou Colen Administration Building 
is concrete testimony to their partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 And the growth of the clinic as a whole is testimony to Irma Colen's astute 
fund-raising strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling on friends to contribute money was one part of that strategy, but 
Colen knew that the whole Venice community needed to be involved, especially 
the community of artists who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Venice Art Walk was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Colen's idea for the Art Walk was that people would pay a fee to tour the 
studios of acclaimed artists, such as Billy Al Bengston, Charles Arnoldi or Guy 
Dill, with a top art expert. "The first Art Walk in 1980 raised $35,000, and I 
thought I would faint. Last year, we raised a half-million dollars," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there are at least five fund-raising projects going on simultaneously, 
overseen by a full-time development director. The projects are run on a 
$4-million annual operating budget, two-thirds of which comes from the private 
sector. The clinic has grown from two small offices to an 18,000-square-foot 
facility serving 11,576 uninsured working poor, unemployed and homeless adults 
and children a year. Close to 200 patients are seen every day. Colen and about 
2,500 volunteers donate their time to the clinic, including 500 physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 But Colen demurs when the credit is given. When President Clinton presented 
the President's 1994 Volunteer Action Award to the clinic, Colen's name was on 
the award. But it was clinic co-founder Dr. Mayer Davidson who accepted the 
award on behalf of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Colen is in charge of special gifts -- donations of more than $1,250 -- 
and holds the title of president emeritus of the Venice Family Clinic. She's 
gratified about the resurgence of people coming forward to give. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is that government is not going to help, and (the donors) are sad 
that there are so many people in need." She's also horrified at what she 
considers a mean-spirited tone coming out of Washington now and fears the 
country is moving backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't give up," she says to Clinton, "and don't give in to those who oppose a 
health-care system for everyone."

VENICE: ANOTHER VIEW ON LOW-INCOME HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So some people in Venice don't want low-income neighbors. ("25-Unit Low-Income 
Housing Project Moves Forward Despite Opposition," 12/8/94). 
</P>
<P>
 As the attorney who evicts drug dealers and gangsters from nonprofit housing 
in L.A. County, (and not a lawyer for these Venice developers), I can say that 
the Oakwood Property Owners Assn. doesn't know what it is talking about.The 
reputations of developers Stephen Clare and David Kramer are excellent in our 
community. And the crime rates in low income, nonprofit, non-governmental 
housing in Venice, West Hollywood and Santa Monica is so low that I have 
shifted almost my entire practice to the Downtown L.A. courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The objectors don't like the homeless, they don't want housing for the working 
poor, and they don't support leftist programs that redistribute our nation's 
wealth. How then are they proposing to make the non-wealthy disappear?

CRIME: NOT EVERY INCIDENT GETS REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your article "Perceptions Aside, Statistics Show a Drop in Crime" 
(Nov. 13), please be aware that in spite of the manipulation of statistics, 
crime is not on the decrease. The media has been persuaded to believe that 
statistics for violent crime are decreasing.I simply believe that not only is 
violent crime being underreported and not prosecuted, but nonviolent crime is 
massively underreported and not prosecuted. So you'll say, "Who cares about 
nonviolent crime?" Well, we all better take heed because the criminals who 
commit nonviolent crimes (graffiti, drug trafficking, etc . . .) are rapidly 
joining the ranks of the more violent criminals. They have learned that they 
not only beat the system but have totally stampeded on top of it. For example, 
I live on a block with 34 duplexes (68 residences) -- approximately 225 
taxpaying citizens. Within the last 18 months, every home on this one block, in 
a "good" neighborhood with an active association and a citizens watch patrol, 
has fallen victim to either burglary, grand theft auto, auto break-in, 
muggings, vandalism, and the list goes on to total approximately 300 incidents! 
Many of the burglaries/petty theft/theft from property go totally underreported 
and many of the auto break-ins are unreported.

WEST HOLLYWOOD: CONFLICT OF INTEREST ALLEGATION BY COUNCILMAN IS CHALLENGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the article, "House of Blues Dispute Sounds Political Note," (12/8/94) 
Scott Collins reported on the accusation of Councilman Steve Martin of the city 
of West Hollywood. Mr. Martin believes it was a conflict of interest for Mayor 
Abbe Land to have accepted a campaign contribution from the House of Blues 
while running for state assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Martin should notice the actions of Ms. Land carefully before speaking and 
dragging West Hollywood into the muck so typical of today's politics.Mayor Land 
has shown no pattern of favoritism in her treatment of the House of Blues. 
True, a contribution was accepted; contributions are a fact of life in 
politics. People in public office should be judged by their actions, not judged 
by who contributes to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Martin should consider the pragmatic economics which govern the welfare of 
a city. The people who live in a city deserve the most respect and the best 
treatment the city can provide. This does, however, require revenue; and for 
that reason the needs of the business community become important. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Abbe Land has been evenhanded in considering both sides. She has done a 
good job of considering the needs of the people who live in West Hollywood 
while considering the restraints and requirements one must face because of the 
city budget.

FASHION: PRAISE FOR KARL KANI AS ROLE MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Designer Karl Kani ("Clothes Make the Man," 12/4/94) has used his success to 
help us at the Foundation for the Junior Blind as a caring and credible mentor 
to sighted inner-city teens in our First Steps Youth Enrichment Program. The 
Foundation created First Steps in 1992 as a commitment to Los Angeles, going 
beyond our work with the blind, visually impaired and multidisabled-blind 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Kani hosted our 1994 class in his offices and told them his story and 
observations firsthand, which expanded the teens' world and gave greater 
relevance to our ongoing First Steps program of providing jobs, teaching life 
skills and developing the self-esteem needed to define and pursue life goals.

DESTINATION: ENGLAND; THE PUB LOVER'S COMPLETE GUIDE TO LONDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ASPINWALL, Aspinwall is a free-lance writer who lives in Aberdeen, 
Scotland. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1930s, George Orwell described his ideal pub as a comfortable, 
convivial place with good conversation and no false pretensions. To others, a 
good pub is simply a place with quality beer and maybe a few books. For Emily 
Green, an American food writer living in England, there are two essentials: "a 
roaring fire and at least one ruddy-cheeked local who will make you feel like a 
city twit." 
</P>
<P>
 As an American expatriate who has become an addict of that venerable social 
institution, the English public house, I have spent a great deal of quality 
time searching for the perfect pub -- one that combines amiable drinking mates, 
Old World ambience and "real" ale. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, this dream has proved to be impossible, and so the search must 
continue. But along the way, I have collected a notebook filled with excellent 
entries. And I have learned a great deal about the distinct characteristics of 
the British pub. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes a pub great? Atmosphere, charm, good conversation, friendly 
bartenders, great beer and, for the utmost perfection in the cold winter 
months, a crackling fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever I marry a wife,  
</P>
<P>
 I'll marry a landlord's daughter,  
</P>
<P>
 For then I may sit in the bar,  
</P>
<P>
 And drink cold brandy and water.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Charles Lamb, 19th-Century English writer 
</P>
<P>
 Two of my all-time favorite pubs are The Dove and the Fox and Hounds, both in 
London. The Dove is on a quiet street alongside the River Thames, in the same 
location where it has been serving ale for nearly 200 years. It's dark. It's 
Old World. It's charming in a Merchant-Ivory sort of way. And it has a great 
view of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dove is in the "Guinness Book of Records" as having the smallest public 
bar, although with seating for a few dozen, it seemed large enough to me and 
certainly capable of fulfilling its responsibilities. The anthem "Rule 
Britannia" was composed upstairs. Inside it is low-beamed and woody, with two 
big fireplaces. One warm spring afternoon I sat outside on the veranda with the 
other drinkers and stared across the river. I thought about the British fleet 
sailing off to tend the empire. 
</P>
<P>
 In London pubs you find various brews on draft, including beers and real ale 
(a fermented drink born in the British Isles that is dark, warm and wonderful), 
as well as American and European lagers. Among the options: ale, an almost 
fruity fermented drink made from malt, hops and yeast like beer, but by rapid 
fermentation at a relatively high temperature; lager, a type of beer with a 
crisp, dry flavor; bitter, an ale with the aroma of hops that is much loved by 
the English; stout, a dark brown beer, and porter, a dark beer similar to 
stout, which usually has a roasted grain flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox and Hounds is a little more upscale than The Dove, but it's also a 
tiny, cozy place. And though it has hosted the famous -- from Rex Harrison to 
Harrison Ford -- it remains an unobtrusive quaffing spot on a quiet corner in 
Belgravia, one of London's toniest quarters. My first visit occurred one dark, 
wintry evening, just as the landlord was unlocking the doors at about 6 p.m. 
Inside was a scene out of Dickens: A coal fire burned and wall lamps glowed 
orange. I sat next to the fire in an overstuffed chair, beneath old engravings 
of hunting scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 As I sipped my Bass ale, the regulars began to arrive: a well-dressed woman 
from the neighborhood sat on a stool at one end of the bar, a postman sat at 
the other. They started talking -- weather, politics and neighborhood gossip -- 
in a way that seemed to have been a resumption of a conversation interrupted 
when the pub closed the evening before. 
</P>
<P>
 If all be true that I do think,  
</P>
<P>
 There are five reasons we should drink;  
</P>
<P>
 Good wine -- a friend -- or being dry --  
</P>
<P>
 Or lest we should be by and by --  
</P>
<P>
 Or any other reason why.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Henry Aldrich, 17th-Century English writer 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another reason, for those who need one: ale brewed on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 For a truly fresh beer, you can do no better than one of the many brewpubs 
dotted across the London landscape. The Ferret and Firkin is one. It brews its 
own malty dark ale called Dogbolter Bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 I found the Ferret and Firkin (a firkin is a quarter barrel) one Sunday 
afternoon with my brother-in-law, Jeremy, and a friend of ours named Rosy. We 
settled in for lunch and drinks in this typical city pub, which sits on a 
corner in Chelsea and has lots of windows, a plank floor and a massive wood 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 A more central brewpub is the Yorkshire Grey, a 10-minute walk from the 
British Museum. On my first visit to the Yorkshire Grey, I asked one of the 
bartenders what he thought of his competitor's Dogbolter beer. "He come up with 
a bloody ridiculous name," growled the barkeep, in a thick Cockney accent. 
Happy hour at the Yorkshire attracts an unlikely blend of pensioners, polite 
punks with pierced eyebrows, construction workers and office types. (Nonsmokers 
be forewarned: Almost every British pub is packed with puffers. This 
smoke-fogged atmosphere gets even worse in colder months, when doors and window 
are closed.)  
</P>
<P>
 Another of my brewpub favorites, the Orange Brewery, is in a neighborhood of 
antique shops a short walk from Victoria Station. The pub is named for the 
small park across the street where actress Nell Gwyn, said to be a mistress of 
King Charles II, supposedly used to sell oranges in the late 1600s. There has 
always been a pub on this square called the Orange in honor of Nell. This 
latter-day version brews its own beer. Like the Yorkshire Grey (both are owned 
by the multinational company Grand Metropolitan Ltd.) there is a sheen of money 
at the Orange: The decor is marked by brass lamps and old pictures; bookshelves 
line the walls. A nice touch is helpful signs that tell about beer styles and 
tours of the brewery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange brews a couple of types of bitter and one kind of porter, the 
latter having a mild, roasted flavor that would be warming on the coldest 
night. This view was not shared by an American businesswoman who appeared with 
some office workers and who quizzed the bartender, Bernadette, about the brew. 
"All they have is bitter," she said to her companions, curling her lip in 
apparent disgust. "I'll have a lager." Bernadette smiled at me knowingly from 
across the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I searched out these brewpubs because of my obsession with fresh local beer -- 
an obsession born of my years as a student here during the 1970s. But plenty of 
London pubs do not brew their own and are none the worse for it. 
</P>
<P>
 For both ambience and location, one of my favorites is the Prince of Wales Ale 
House in London's Highgate Village neighborhood, a short walk from Hampstead 
Heath and Highgate Cemetery (the final resting place of Karl Marx, among 
others). The Prince of Wales is snug and comfy, a wood-paneled pub with 
fireplaces at either end of the room. One of the most important duties of a pub 
-- serving hearty game pie or ploughman's (salad) lunch -- is done superbly at 
the Prince of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because it is in a textbook-quaint and upscale area of north London, 
it may be beyond the pocketbook of the proletarian. If it is cheap beer and 
philosophy you're after, you can't do better than the Beaver's Retreat pub on 
the fourth floor of the Old Building of the London School of Economics, my alma 
mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Books on sociology and economics line the bookcases near the fireplace; 
overstuffed chairs are filled by Galoise-smoking intellectuals. Beer will 
forever remain cheap at the university because there is nothing that will 
likely incite the Trotskyite-leaning student body to riot faster than a hike in 
beer prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fields and trees teach me nothing, but people in a city do," Socrates said, 
and this is how I feel about London. So, when I've had enough of campus 
atmosphere, I head for the George IV, a classic city pub within spitting 
distance of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The George IV holds forth on a corner of Portugal Street, opposite The 
Economist Bookshop and directly under the LSE Government Department. Its 
central bar is ringed with hanging mugs, and the windows allow the city 
professionals a good view of passing female students during cocktail hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Drink! For you know not whence you came, nor why,  
</P>
<P>
 Drink! For you know not why you go, nor where.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Omar Khayyam, "Rubaiyat" 
</P>
<P>
 Not far to the north in the Bloomsbury neighborhood is the Lamb, a gorgeous 
old place with swiveling mahogany and etched glass panels that divide the 
bartenders from the patrons. Occasionally, the staff passes around a tray of 
free sandwiches. Old theatrical prints adorn the walls. My ex-landlady told me 
she was a regular there in the years after World War II. The Lamb was at one 
time a favorite haunt of writers, and it is only two blocks from where Charles 
Dickens once lived. He loved to tipple, though I don't know whether he came to 
the Lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who comes here? A Grenadier. What does he want? A pot of beer," Dickens wrote 
in his last completed novel, "Our Mutual Friend." He would have a choice of 
some absolutely superb beers at the Lamb, like Winter Warmer and Oatmeal Stout, 
both silky smooth dark beers with the robustness to stand up to a London winter 
fog. 
</P>
<P>
 For the ultimate in beer choices, though, one must wait until summer. At 
London's Great British Beer Festival, held each August, more than 300 of the 
finest ales in the country are on tap in the city's famous Olympia exhibition 
hall, a massive Victorian building with a 100-foot-high vaulted glass ceiling. 
For three days the hall becomes the city's biggest pub. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to doing some heavy beer sampling when I visited last summer, I 
wandered around and I found myself staring at Michael Jackson, who was 
surrounded by legions of devout fans. This Michael Jackson, however, was not 
the pop star but rather the man recognized by many as the world's leading 
expert on beer and ale. He had recently chosen a Yorkshire brew called Landlord 
Ale as his selection of the month in a London newspaper column. I asked him 
about all the fuss over brews. "What's the difference, isn't beer beer?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's like saying wine is wine," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 A man in a pin-striped suit came over and apologized for intruding. "These 
Belgian beers you recommended over the years all taste like home brew gone 
rotten. Can't you recommend something decent?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was patient. "I would suggest you go to the foreign beer bar right now 
and try a Westmalle Triple. It's a Belgian monastery beer." 
</P>
<P>
 One final London suggestion: Hamilton Hall, a pub in a corner of the Liverpool 
Street train station, in the financial district. Hamilton Hall is 
unquestionably London's most beautiful pub, situated in an enormous room with 
20-foot ceilings decorated with elaborate gold moldings and figurines of 
angels. Shelves of books stand by the marble fireplace. It seems more like a 
French tea room or an exhibition hall in St. Petersburg's Hermitage museum than 
a pub. Every time I pass through this train station, I consider it mandatory to 
stop in Hamilton Hall for a pint. 
</P>
<P>
 Liverpool Street station is where you catch the train to Norwich, a gorgeous 
medieval city about a two-hour ride away, and I strongly recommend a visit 
there to experience rural pubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fur and Feather in Woodbastwick (about eight miles northeast of Norwich) 
might be my favorite pub in all of England. Woodbastwick is a pastoral country 
village surrounded by a patchwork quilt of brown and green fields. The pub 
occupies a thatched cottage next to a converted barn housing Woodforde's 
Norfolk Ale brewery. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde's brewery is named for a local country parson, James Woodforde, who 
kept a detailed record of his life in the late 18th Century. Woodforde brewed 
often, and he invited the village farmers around for dinner and drinks at his 
yearly church tithing collection in early December, during which they 
invariably got drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 As he recorded in "The Diary of a Country Parson," the farmers at the 1791 
party, "paid me their respective dues and dined and left about 12 o'clock at 
night, well pleased with their entertainment. They spoke highly in favour of my 
strong Beer, they never drank any better they said." 
</P>
<P>
 A mere two centuries later, the judges at the Great British Beer Festival said 
the same thing about Woodforde's Norfolk Nog, awarding it first prize in 1992. 
Norfolk Nog is a winter ale -- its robustness and palate reminiscent of the 
harvest make it just the thing to accompany a game of backgammon by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Another superb pub region is Dorset, which is also renowned for its lovely 
countryside of rolling hills and cliffs overlooking the English Channel 
southwest of London and its emerald pastures stitched together by hedgerows and 
dotted with stone cottages. 
</P>
<P>
 No pub lover should miss the Square and Compass in the tiny Purbeck village of 
Worth Matravers, west of Bournemouth. Named for the local stone quarrying 
tools, it is a low-ceilinged, whitewashed stone cottage with heavy wood beams 
and an enormous fireplace. Mahogany panels line the walls and kegs of beer lie 
on their sides behind the bar. A neighborhood gathering always seems to be 
taking place here. 
</P>
<P>
 I discovered the Square and Compass on a trip a decade ago and recently 
returned for a nostalgic visit. Now I shall put my pencil away and have a beer, 
mindful of what John Ransom, a 20th-Century American poet and critic, wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 God have mercy on the sinner  
</P>
<P>
 Who must write with no dinner,  
</P>
<P>
 No gravy and no grub,  
</P>
<P>
 No pewter and no pub,  
</P>
<P>
 No belly and no bowels,  
</P>
<P>
 Only consonants and vowels.

TRAVEL INSIDER: TRAVEL AGENTS TRYING NEW IDEAS TO KEEP YOUR BUSINESS; 
INNOVATION: ONE AGENCY TRIES TO LURE NEW CUSTOMERS WITH ITS OWN FREQUENT-FLYER 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Travel agents have never been all that well understood by the traveling 
public. But now may be the most important time in years to make sure yours is a 
good one. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the country's roughly 30,000 travel agents still charge 
consumers nothing, and make their money by taking commissions from hotels, 
airlines and tour operators to whom they send business. But now -- as 
computer-savvy consumers gain access to information that agents once had to 
themselves, and travel providers increase their efforts to sell tickets 
directly to travelers and airlines reduce their commission rates for agents -- 
agencies are scrambling for new strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Two recent examples suggest that some of those strategies will be clever, 
innovative and likely to save consumers money and win loyalty. Others will be 
old-fashioned or ill-advised, and might even steer customers away from the 
travel arrangements that best suit them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of most promising agency ideas is a new offer from Travel Network Ltd. of 
Englewood Cliffs, N.J. -- a large travel agency with its own frequent-flyer 
program, completely separate from the airline programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel Network (800-222-2220), a franchise chain with $850 million in sales 
last year and 340 outlets in the U.S. and abroad (including offices in Lomita, 
Glendale, Costa Mesa and Laguna Hills) on Sept. 1 introduced its Matching Miles 
program, which allows agency customers to accrue credits by booking flights 
through Travel Network on any of eight major U.S.-based airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Once travelers' mileage hits a certain target level on one airline, they can 
redeem their Matching Miles for flights on any of the eight participating 
carriers. For a domestic coach ticket to a major U.S. city: 25,000 miles on a 
single airline. For a coach ticket to Hawaii: 40,000. South Pacific coach 
tickets go for 120,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, if you book your flights on one of the credit cards that has its own 
frequent-flyer program tie-in, and you already belong to the mileage program of 
the airline you're flying, you're triple-accumulating with every ticket you buy 
through Travel Network. Enrollment is free. 
</P>
<P>
 There are drawbacks. Members are required to buy all tickets through the same 
location and keep their boarding passes as proof of flights. There are blackout 
dates during which reward tickets are unavailable. Mileage expires three years 
after it is earned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Brent, president of Travel Network, reports that the company has 
been getting 3,000 inquiry calls per month  
</P>
<P>
 since unveiling the idea, and with an ad campaign rolling out in six different 
in-flight magazines, more are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel Network acquires its award tickets by buying from airlines at 
high-volume discounts. Participating airlines are America West, American, 
Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA, United and USAir. ( 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime in 1995, Brent plans a second phase of the program that will allow 
travelers to accrue matching miles for non-air-fare bookings such as cruises 
and package trips. And beginning Jan. 6 on the Internet, Brent expects Travel 
Network to offer its Electronic Travel Agent (ETA) program on which travelers 
can book flights themselves but earn double credit through Travel Network as a 
reward for saving reservation agents time. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, American Express is testing a similar idea at some of its San 
Francisco and Florida outlets. Randy Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer 
magazine, predicts a surge of travel agency interest in such programs. Consumer 
Reports Travel Letter calls Matching Miles "a considerable challenge" to 
American Express and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Less encouraging, if you're looking for signs of forward thinking among travel 
agents, is the example set recently by two officers of the Assn. of Retail 
Travel Agents. 
</P>
<P>
 In fall, 1993, Susan Bruno of Los Altos, Calif., and Jack Stults of Joplin, 
Mo., issued news press releases to Travel Weekly and other trade publications, 
each announcing plans to boycott suppliers of travel services that they said 
didn't meet association "objectives." In particular, Travel Weekly reported, 
the agents cited Avis rental cars and Morris Air (since bought by Southwest) 
and urged other agents to take stands as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents apparently were not angry over service received by clients, but by 
an Avis promotion (which offered agency employees a chance to win their own 
agencies) and by Morris Air's inaccessibility on the computer reservation 
systems used by most travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents' public statements didn't sit well with officials in the U.S. 
Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, who wondered if this was an 
unreasonable way of restraining trade. They took the issue to federal court, 
where last October ARTA was enjoined from "inviting or encouraging concerted 
action by travel agents . . . to refuse to do business with specified suppliers 
. . . or to do business with specified suppliers only on specified terms." 
</P>
<P>
 ARTA, a 1,500 member Arlington, Va.-based group, does not speak for most U.S. 
travel agents. But the case is a healthy reminder of the built-in flaw in the 
standard travel agent-client relationship: An agent's own economic interests 
can conflict with a client's best interests.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: TUCSON, ARIZONA; TWO PEOPLE PACK IN A LOT OF DESERT FOR A 
LITTLE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MANKIN, Mankin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>

<P>
 We wanted to get out to the desert. Usually that means just driving east, but 
an interesting arithmetic had presented itself. The round-trip fare to Tucson 
for two people, with tax, was $158 on Morris Air, thanks to an accompanying 
passenger discount. (Morris has since been bought by Southwest Airlines, which 
offers a similar round-trip for two for about $120.) Budget offered people 
showing airline tickets a special weekend rate of $20.50 per day on 
larger-than-juice-can rental cars. The hotel rate season had conveniently 
shifted from peak to shoulder. The bottom line was wings, wheels and a bed for 
three nights away for two people in Tucson for about $400. So we went to visit 
the saguaros, and wound up very pleased we had. 
</P>
<P>
 We were on the 7:30 a.m. flight on Friday morning out of LAX, and by 10:30 we 
were driving west on the Ajo highway under a glorious sun. The teal-green Ford 
Escort was a little underpowered, but it had enthusiastic air conditioning and 
a surprisingly good sound system -- and we had brought a case of cassettes. The 
surprisingly lush -- at least, to eyes accustomed to the much drier Colorado 
and Mojave deserts -- countryside slid away as Vivaldi gave way to Best 
O'Boingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Our feeling of well-being was momentarily jarred when we pulled into the 
packed parking lot of Old Tucson, a western movie set turned theme park. This 
was, we realized instantaneously, not what we had left Los Angeles to visit. We 
180ed at the gate and, 1 1/2 Boingo tunes later, we were parked at the nearby 
Desert Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 It calls itself a museum, but it is equally an ingeniously designed zoo and a 
beautifully landscaped botanical garden that aims to be a complete introduction 
to the geology, ecology and history of the Sonora Desert. The park immediately 
endeared itself to one hungry and caffeine - addicted traveler with excellent 
varietal coffee and gigantic scones at its coffee shop ($5 for two), and 
subsequently confirmed its good impression with a 
much-better-than-institutional late lunch ($11) of chicken tacos and fruit 
salad at its restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 We took the long way back to the city, winding across the desert in a broad 
loop that took us past miles of cactus before putting back on the freeway. We 
exited and cruised for miles on the endless commercial strip called Speedway 
Boulevard to the Smuggler's Inn, a $55-a-night, plus tax, semi-famous motel we 
had picked out of the AAA handbook. (Current high season rates are $110 but 
revert to summer rates again in May.) The rooms were vast, frigidly 
air-conditioned and clean, and both the New York and Los Angeles Times were on 
sale in the lobby. Three hours later, we were back in the car, heading for 
Fourth Avenue, Tucson's Westwood/Santa Monica Promenade/Pasadena Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite: Most of the stores had closed by 6 on a Friday evening. We 
window-shopped our way down the street and around to the Congress Hotel, the 
richly seedy relic of Tucson's days as a railroad town that now functions as an 
unofficial downtown cultural center. There we learned that we were just a day 
early: Tomorrow night was a Tucson Downtown Saturday Night, a twice-monthly 
street fair when everything would be open. The next morning was for cactus: We 
loaded the car with fruit we had bought the day before and headed out to the 
eastern segment of Saguaro National Monument. The saguaro is the icon and 
emblem of Arizona, a shape utterly its own, instantly recognizable, a set of 
endlessly diverting variations on the theme of the plump central stalk, 15 or 
20 feet high plus arms, which begin to grow when the plant is 50 or so years 
old. The effect is simultaneously dignified and playful, majestic and ironic.  
</P>
<P>
 The eastern half of the monument is less visited than the west, which contains 
the Desert Museum. A circular road runs around the periphery of the park, 
surrounding a maze of hiking trails. The weather was perfect for walking; a 
peaceful and benign 80 degrees with just a hint of breeze. Three hours and 
several hundred saguaro later, we were back in the car, spiritually lifted, and 
we headed south, driving a long leisurely loop through pretty desert, wooded 
valleys, past the ranch towns of Sonoita and Patagonia, almost all the way down 
to the Mexican border at Nogales, then back north to the National Historical 
Park at Tumacacori. 
</P>
<P>
 We were by this time famished, notwithstanding the bread and fruit we had 
brought. Fortunately, directly opposite the park the Tumacacori Restaurant was 
flying the blue and white stripes of Greece, offering Greek salad, gyros, 
moussaka and baklava, along with burros and chimichangas.  
</P>
<P>
 We enthusiastically dived in ($18) and, much refreshed, toured the ruins of 
the old mission (founded 1691; structure built a century later) under the 
informative guidance of an endlessly enthusiastic bilingual guide named Tim who 
paused under the vault of the sanctuary to render a segment of the Mass in a 
sweet, true tenor. 
</P>
<P>
 Five miles north of the mission is the arts and crafts colony of Tubac, 100 or 
so shops in adobe buildings, roughly 80 of them offering dream catchers -- the 
feathered, circular ornaments ubiquitous in southern Arizona -- the rest an 
assortment of (to us) unimpressive arts and crafts. We did like a big 
terra-cotta Mexican planter in the shape of a chicken, which we bought on an 
honor system from a closed store, slipping a check for the amount plus sales 
tax through the mail slot.  
</P>
<P>
 Back in Tucson, we bought Los Angeles and New York papers, and retired to 
recharge batteries. By 7 we were ready for the street fair. We arrived downtown 
to find half of Tucson milling happily through the streets; bola-tied, 
sun-baked old - line 'Zonies, kids dutifully answering fashion's call to 
swelter in Northwest grunge outfits, Bermuda-shorted snowbirds, big Latino 
families and a hell-and-brimstone evangelist with a much too powerful sound 
system. The street scene moved into the music scene. A group of clubs downtown, 
in connection with the excellent local free weekly newspaper were offering a $5 
pass, good at 10 nearby live music venues, each one featuring a different genre 
of sounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Rousing ourselves the next morning, we drove up toward the foothills to the 
Tohono Chul desert preserve, a 37-acre island in the city, containing a 
botanical garden, an art gallery, a bookstore and, finally, a tea room with a 
locally famous brunch, $19 for two, served outdoors under a mesquite tree, as 
hummingbirds buzzed and whirred past us. We lingered over coffee and then made 
our leisurely way back through the gallery (an exhibit of some remarkable 
50-year-old quilts), and then back through the twisting, lovingly cared for 
trails of the preserve.  
</P>
<P>
 A ticket-pricing glitch had made it cheaper to pay for another night in the 
motel than to fly back Sunday night. We spent the afternoon at the University 
of Arizona, and went to the mission at San Xavier del Bac, a well-ornamented 
and pretty 18th-Century church of the kind you'll find in a thousand Mexican 
towns. And then we went to have a blowout meal. As the sun went down, we drove 
up into the hills to the Loew's Ventana Canyon Resort, an attractive jumble of 
glass and steel neatly wedged between clumps of enormous saguaros at the mouth 
of a canyon, fronting a swimming pool that seemed the size of Lake Michigan. 
The Ventana Room here, looking down over the valley was supposed to serve good 
food, and it actually surpassed the reports, from the venison carpaccio through 
the herbed duck. It cost $136, including the Veuve Clicquot and the 
unimprovable service, and was eminently worth every penny. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was early the next morning. At 8:15 a.m. we were back in Los 
Angeles; that morning, we were both at work. Sure, we'd go back.

HIKING: VENTURA COUNTY: AMID MISTS AND MYSTICS IN OJAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ojai, nestled in a little valley backed by the Topa Topa and Sulphur 
mountains, has meant tranquillity to several generations of settlers and citrus 
growers, artists, musicians and mystics. Ojai Valley was the setting for 
Shangri-La in the 1937 movie "Lost Horizon."  
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Valley Trail explores the town and valley. From the path, hikers get 
great views of the harmonious Spanish architecture of Ojai, sweet-smelling 
citrus groves and the sometimes misty, sometimes magical Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail, a paved walking-cycling path, paralleled by a dirt bridle trail, 
extends nine miles southwest from Soule Park on the eastern outskirts of Ojai 
to the hamlet of Casitas Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Valley Trail is a "rails-to-trails" conversion of a century-old railroad 
line that hauled trainloads of oranges from local growers.  
</P>
<P>
 At times the trail meanders near downtown Ojai and at other times drops behind 
a ridgeline to give walkers a sense of getting away from it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail is popular with fast-striding fitness walkers, parents pushing their 
offspring in jogger-strollers, cyclists, guests at Ojai's spas and spiritual 
retreats, and lots of locals. 
</P>
<P>
 First stop for walkers should be the Chamber of Commerce Visitors Center at 
338 E. Ojai Ave. (Hours: Monday-Friday 9:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday 
10 a.m.-4 p.m.) Ask for a copy of the "Ojai Valley Business and Shopping Map." 
Also pick up a schedule of the Ojai Trolley Service (805-640-2562); leg-weary 
hikers can hop on the trolley (a 25-cent fare -- what a deal!) to ease the 
return to downtown Ojai or the trail head. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Valley Trail begins at the eastern end of Ojai at Soule Park. Take Ojai 
Avenue (County 150) through downtown to Soule Park on Fox Road. Park along Fox 
Road near the signed beginning of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite part of the path extends from Soule Park to the intersection of 
county highways 33 and 150. It's a bit over six miles round trip (about a 10K 
walk). 
</P>
<P>
 The path heads west a mile and a half back to downtown and Libbey Park, home 
of the Ojai Music Festival. The park is a lovely, kid-friendly place to play or 
to picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mile and a half brings you to the intersection of highways 33 and 150. 
For the walker, Ojai Valley Trail loses some of its charm beyond this point 
because for the next couple of miles it closely parallels County 33. (The 
trail's last leg leaves the highway behind and is more walker-friendly.) 
</P>
<P>

 WHERE: Ojai, Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 9 miles one way; shorter walks possible. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Gentle rolling hills; the "valley of Shangri-La."

 The 21st Colorado Indian Market and Western Art Roundup has corralled more 
than 400 artists, some from as far away as Alaska and Peru, for a big sale and 
demonstration at the Denver Convention Complex Jan. 13-16. This is an 
opportunity to meet many well-known artists working in four genres: Native 
American, Western, Southwest and wildlife. There's also continuous 
entertainment, a fashion show including both traditional hide dresses and fancy 
Southwest outfits (all for sale). Elaine Miles, who plays Marilyn on CBS's 
"Northern Exposure" will appear. For more information, contact the Colorado 
Indian Market, P.O. Box 17187, Boulder, Colo. 80308; telephone (303) 447-9967. 
Hawaii 
</P>
<P>
 The 14th annual Molokai Makahiki, Jan. 28 in Kaunakakai Park in the town of 
Kaunakakai, is an all-day New Year's celebration of traditional Hawaiian 
culture. The focus is on island games (such as rock-throwing and rope pulls) 
for adults and children. Plenty of Hawaiian food, music and hula performances. 
For more information, contact the Molokai Visitors Assn., P.O. Box 960, 
Kaunakakai, Hawaii 96748; tel. (808) 553-3876. Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of construction at the Lincoln Memorial (the traditional location), 
the Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday Observance, held on Jan. 13, will begin at 
11 a.m., two blocks away, in the Department of the Interior Auditorium, with 
choirs, speakers and a taped presentation of King's famous "I Have a Dream" 
speech. Following this, the crowd will march to the memorial for a 
wreath-laying. For more information, contact the National Park Service, 
National Capital Regional Office, 1100 Ohio Drive, S.W., Room 112, Washington, 
D.C. 20242; tel. (202) 619-7222. Greece 
</P>
<P>
 Epiphany, the final celebration of the Christmas season, is observed in 
varying degrees in Christian churches around the world. In Greece, the 
observance takes on a uniformly aquatic theme when the blessing of the waters 
takes place in churches all over the country. If the Mediterranean isn't 
nearby, a river will do: A cross is thrown into the water by the parish priest. 
The rituals in Piraeus, a harbor of Athens, are very colorful with a small 
parade and band music. The diver who retrieves the cross is thought to be 
blessed with good luck for the next year. For more information, contact the 
Greek National Tourist Organization, 611 W. 6th St., Suite 2198, Los Angeles, 
Calif. 90017; tel. (213) 626-6696. Jamaica 
</P>
<P>
 The Maroon Festival is celebrated Jan. 6 in the interior town of Accompong in 
the parish of St. Elizabeth. The Maroons -- a centuries-old name for fugitive 
slaves who escaped to freedom in the island's highlands -- honor their 
traditions with a day of drumming, dancing, singing and welcoming visitors who 
make their way to this remote area. For more information, contact the Jamaica 
Tourist Board, 3440 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1207, Los Angeles, Calif. 90010; tel. 
(213) 384-1123. Mexico 
</P>
<P>
 The Festivals of Santa Prisca and San Sebastian, the two patron saints of 
Taxco, are celebrated in this picturesque silver town Jan. 18. First, Mass is 
celebrated in the cathedral of Santa Prisca on the central plaza. Parishioners 
parade their pets and farm animals past the entrance to be blessed with holy 
water. Nearby, there are game booths, food vendors and dancers and music 
throughout the day. The celebration ends with a fireworks display. For more 
information, contact the Mexican Government Tourism Office, 10100 Santa Monica 
Blvd., Suite 224, Los Angeles, Calif. 90067; tel. (310) 203-8191.

 Looking for a spot off the beaten path? Here are a few on each coast: 
</P>
<P>
 Rosario Resort on Orcas Island, one of the San Juan Islands near Puget Sound 
off the coast of Washington, can be reached from the mainland by a one-hour 
ferryboat ride. The resort is listed in the National Register of Historic 
Places and was built in 1909 as the residence of a shipping tycoon. The resort 
has an imposing pipe organ with almost 2,000 pipes, and many evenings there is 
an organ concert (call hotel for schedule) and a presentation on the resort's 
history. Orcas Island boasts a 5,000-acre park with waterfalls, lakes and 
picturesque harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosario Resort is offering a seniors getaway package that includes guest rooms 
with views, round-trip ferry service, continental breakfast, taxes and tips. 
The rate for two, one of whom must be over age 55, is $75 per night. For 
information, call (800) 562-8820.

</P>
<P>
 In Blaine, Wash., farther north near the Canadian border, is the Inn at 
Semiahmoo, a luxury resort hotel with 200 large guest rooms, some with 
balconies and wood-burning fireplaces. The resort was at one time a salmon 
cannery. It offers a discount from published rates based on the guest's age. 
For example, a 70-year-old guest would get a 70% discount. Minimum age is 55 to 
qualify. Offer valid until March 31. Regular rates are $175. Water-view 
executive suites range from $245 to $375. For information, call (800) 996-3426. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over on the Gulf Coast, the Park Inn in Bradenton, Fla., south of St. 
Petersburg, is offering senior discounts of 15% to 20% depending on location of 
guest rooms for members of the American Assn. of Retired Persons or those over 
age 60. Regular per-person rates are $90 to $95, or $115 for a VIP suite or one 
with a Jacuzzi. The following extras are included: daily deluxe continental 
breakfast, two cocktails per adult, one game of bowling for each guest, use of 
fitness center and discounts on miniature golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfers may prefer the Park Inn's Hole in One deal, which includes continental 
breakfast, cocktails, use of spa, beach towels and 54 holes of golf including 
cart on four different full-size courses. Package prices from January through 
April are $310 per person but are sharply reduced to $195 per person from May 
through October. For brochures and information call (800) 437-7275. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Peabody Hotel in Orlando, Fla., advertises itself as "Orlando's only 
Five-Duck resort" since it has inaugurated the "March of the Peabody Ducks," 
where ducks waddle through the hotel lobby twice daily. The ducky idea 
originated at an affiliate hotel of the same name in Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peabody Orlando, with just under 900 rooms, is extending its discount 
promotion for seniors to run throughout the calendar year 1995. Regular room 
rates run from $210 to $230 per night but are reduced to $89 for those over 50. 
The Orlando Peabody is near Walt Disney World, Sea World and Universal Studios. 
Public transportation is available to those destinations. For information or 
reservations at the Orlando Peabody, call (800) 732-2639.

TAKING THE KIDS: HINTS TO EASE HOLIDAY TRAVELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So the airport is jammed and your flight has been delayed for hours. The kids 
are whining. Your spouse is getting grumpier by the minute. They lost your 
rental car reservation and damaged your favorite suitcase. Is that any reason 
to hate holiday travel? 
</P>
<P>
 You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not counting all the energy we invest in creating the Perfect 
Holiday Experience. "People get so caught up in all the traditions that 
everyone gets stressed out, even the kids," said Sharon Berry, a child 
psychologist at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can't stay home. The in-laws are expecting you. The ski condo is 
already paid for. You called in every favor at the office to get the week off. 
So along with millions of other American families, you're determined to make 
your way from point A to point C this month . . . no matter what. Here are some 
tips that may make that holiday journey a little easier -- for parents and 
children. Tips for parents: 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're heading out to visit family or friends, tell them ahead of time 
what you'll need: a crib and apple juice for the baby, a certain brand of 
cereal or favorite snacks for the older kids. Can they scout out some special 
holiday attractions nearby to take the kids to? Will they have some simple 
foods on the holiday table the kids will eat? 
</P>
<P>
 If you have toddlers or babies, gently remind your hosts about keeping pills 
and poisons locked away. Suggest they move breakables. Check that the Christmas 
lights are out of reach and move the poinsettias. They're poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
 * Delays are inevitable whether you're traveling by car, train, boat or plane 
over the holidays. The trick with kids is to be ready for every eventuality. 
UCLA child psychologist Jill Waterman remembers one particularly bleak 
Christmas marooned for hours in the Denver airport with 18-month-old, 
jet-lagged twins. "It was miserable," said Waterman, who now picks off-peak 
days to travel during the holidays. Whatever the kids' ages, travel armed with 
plenty of "surprise" trinkets, toys, games, tapes and books that you can pull 
out when the going gets rough. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're traveling with an infant, stow plenty of juice, diapers, formula, 
baby food and clothes where you can get to them quickly. There's nothing worse 
than a soaked infant without a dry diaper. And don't forget the car seat. If 
you're flying, he or she will be more comfortable and safer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep an extra T-shirt or sweat shirt within reach in case they spill pop all 
over themselves or, as has happened to my kids more than once, get sick. 
</P>
<P>
 * "No matter where you go on vacation, people are going to get sick, and kids 
are much more susceptible," said Los Angeles pediatrician Jeff Fireman. Add 
bitter cold, not enough sleep and too much rich food and it's no wonder kids 
get sick. Always pack children's acetaminophen, a thermometer, a first-aid kit 
and any medicines your child might need for a chronic condition such as asthma 
or allergies. 
</P>
<P>
 What are you waiting for? Start packing. Tips for kids: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pack your school backpack with a couple of favorite books and games. A joke 
book is a good bet, as is a deck of cards. Bring along a hand-held video game 
and a small tape or CD player, if you have one. They're great for tuning out 
annoying brothers and sisters. Parents, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * Offer to pack your own suitcase so you can make sure you've got your 
favorite jeans, T-shirts and sneakers. Don't forget plenty of underwear or the 
good clothes your mom wants you to wear for the big family dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask for a map so you can help plot the route and help navigate in the car. 
Look carefully at the landscape you pass. What's different from home? 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're flying alone to visit your mom or dad, make sure you have his or 
her phone number and know how to call collect. Carry money with you and plan 
what you'll do if you get stuck in the airport because of bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sure, you want to check out your cousins' neighborhood or explore the ski 
resort or hotel. Just make sure your parents know where you're going. Write 
down the address or room number and the phone where you're staying and stick it 
in your pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 * No matter how much you hate any of the presents you got from relatives, just 
smile and say thank you. You can exchange them later. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>

 I was recently injured when the hook of the bungee cord for my small luggage 
cart came undone from the bottom and snapped up and hit me below the eye. 
Please caution your readers to purchase only those carts with straps or cords

AIRPORT FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Brand Name Food Courts at LAX," (Travel Insider, Oct. 23): As a 
former airline executive, I have had to deal with many city/county-owned 
airport administrations. The traveling public has every right to voice its 
displeasure with the high cost and low quality of food sold at many 
airports.However, the concessionaires are seldom the true culprits. If Panda 
Express, KFC, Burger King, etc. were able to obtain suitable rental space at 
rates comparable to nearby malls, I am certain they would be more willing to 
charge the same prices as they do off-airport. But greedy civil servants 
running airports such as LAX as independent profit centers usually charge 
tenants (not just food concessions) high rent plus a healthy share of the 
profits. The City Council is not likely to intervene on behalf of the 
"victims," as the bulk of the airport shoppers are travelers residing in other 
cities/countries without local voting rights.

 A couple from Hesperia walked into our restaurant and presented us with a copy 
of your Oct. 2 "Best Shot" of the restored sawmill in Weston, Vt.They said they 
saw the picture and decided to find the place that looked so wonderful and 
welcoming. I just wanted to let you know that someone crossed the United States 
to find Weston because of your selection.

SICILIAN STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed "Blood and Watermelon" (Nov. 13) by Rita Giordano. Ms. Giordano 
shares the same surname as my "nonna" (grandmother), although my nonna was 
Sicilian. I couldn't help but wonder if Ms. Giordano's nonna would turn over in 
her grave if, after all, her bloodline was Sicilian -- "the wild land of wild 
people" -- and not from the north "land of Italian kings."

REDEFINING JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Margaret Scott notes the inscription on the Hiroshima cenotaph: "Let all souls 
rest here in peace, for the error shall not be repeated" ("Re-Imagining Japan," 
Nov. 13). There's an error, all right, but it was not the use of the atomic 
bomb.It is describing an evil act -- a sin -- as a simple human error. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scientific view, humans do not sin or do evil but merely make mistakes. 
They are the products of scientific determinism, and they cannot be held 
responsible for evil more than can any other animal. There is no sin, no moral 
basis for judgment.  
</P>
<P>
 Can this be the source of our inability to cope with crime and social evils? 
We have lived through concentration camps, genocide and the Holocaust, and all 
that the scientific mind can say is that someone erred. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the answers to the questions on the enigma of Japan lie in that 
nation's worship of technology. Perhaps the reason the Japanese will not 
officially admit guilt for war crimes lies behind the way they approach 
admitting responsibility, by saying "mistakes were made." Pearl Harbor was a 
"mistake," as was Nanking. Our fearful vengeance at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was, 
of course, not a mistake but rather "strategic necessity."

LAWYER ON THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to Deanne Stillman for her compelling profile of Gloria Allred, 
distinctive in its lack of Vanity Fair hype ("G-L-O-R-I-A," Nov. 13). 
Stillman's keen, witty and objective take on a controversial public figure gave 
me the rare impression that I wasn't being fed a mouthful of gaff. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had friends seek Allred's counsel as well as cross swords with her. I've 
always considered her choice of battles noble but thought that her love of 
self-congratulatory personal press undermined those causes. Stillman is one who 
is able to rehumanize people the press has made appear two-dimensional. Her 
portrayal of Allred is a complex character study of a civil-rights warrior in a 
skirt-hostile system.

 Be warned: If you don't have at least $100 (maybe more now -- my experience 
with Allred was a few years ago) up front, no one will even read the form you 
fill out and send in. It takes a few hundred more for someone to evaluate it 
and honor you with an appointment. I was asked to hand over $2,500 before she 
would even consider my "really good case."

 Stillman is incorrect in stating that Ellie Nesler "killed the man who had 
just been convicted of molesting her son." The man Nesler killed was in court 
preparing to go on trial for molestation. While he may have been guilty, his 
only conviction on that charge had been in the court of public opinion.

 We regret having inconvenienced the puzzle solvers. The puzzle in its correct 
form appeared in Sunday Calendar that same day. And because of our long lead 
time for printing, the faulty puzzle -- an error, not a mind-boggling new 
format -- could not be corrected in the following issue. Cheers to all those 
readers who defied the incorrect grid and the absence of numbers to construct 
the puzzle from scratch and then solve it -- the pioneer spirit survives.

 I had to laugh at Patt Morrison's column regarding the need to remember too 
many numbers. ("Dial M for Madness," On the Town, Nov. 13).I, too, can remember 
my childhood telephone number, HUdson 2-9052, later HOllywood 2-9052. I also 
recall film detective Sam Spade's license plate, 137596, and Central 102 for 
Maier Beer. Of course such information is useless when standing in front of an 
ATM wondering which PIN I need.

 I have for quite a while enjoyed Morrison's work on the "Life & Times" TV 
program, but her piece on the telephone exchanges truly delighted me. I thought 
I (at 76) was the only person who still remembered a phone number from the 
1920s, and, yes, I still forget once in a while and give my home phone as 
GRanite 6 - - - -.

 For your information, OX in Beverly Hills, where I used to live, was OXford,

 Morrison replies: A Pacific Bell representative mistakenly informed me that

and it was one of several in the Beverly Hills exchange. Thanks for setting the 
record straight.

TAIWAN TALKBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have read "The Taiwan Connection" (by Marlowe Hood, Oct. 9) with 
disappointment and feel obliged to register our protest. The article's figures 
for the kilos of heroin seized in Taiwan were incorrect. Except in 1980 and 
1981, more than three kilos of heroin were seized each year in the 1980s, and 
in 1983, 1984 and 1986-89, more than 10 kilos were confiscated. True, the year 
1993 was a peak year, with 1,113.9 kilos of heroin seized, but the first eight 
months of 1993 saw a 30% decline in the amount confiscated. The figure was 
579.63 kilos, not 1,000 kilos as the article stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan is not a transit point for drugs or illegal immigrants. The accusation 
that Taiwan is a major transit area rests primarily on the assumption that "the 
massive amounts of heroin seized is far in excess of the amount needed to 
supply the Republic of China's domestic needs," according to a 1993 FBI report 
cited in the article. However, the number of drug abusers may total 
240,000-480,000 people, and the republic's "domestic needs" have created a 
large market that consumes thousands of kilos of heroin and methamphetamines 
each year. It is inconceivable for drug traffickers to smuggle heroin into 
Taiwan and run a great risk again by smuggling it out to the United States when 
it can be readily sold in Taiwan at good prices. 
</P>
<P>
 No political corruption has been found so far. The 1993 International Narcotic 
Control Strategy Report published by the State Department in April, 1994, 
states that "authorities are increasingly involved in combatting the rapidly 
growing drug-abuse problem. Taiwan's drug laws are being strengthened." 
</P>
<P>
 Accusations of high officials who are involved in the smuggling rings have 
never been independently verified either by U.S. officials or authorities of 
the republic. We welcome any information in this regard. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the article incorrectly quoted Justice Minister Ma as saying, when 
asked whether any linkages remained between the government and organized crime, 
"That was a long time ago." In fact, the minister does not know about any of 
these "links" and would appreciate being apprised of any evidence of corruption 
involving officials. 
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hood responds: According to Taiwan's government-run China News Agency, on 
April 15, 1993, "police seized an average of 3 or 4 kilos of (heroin) each year 
before 1989," a figure confirmed by Taiwan's National Police Administration. 
But even if Wu's marginally higher figures are correct, the point is that 
seizures soared 819% between 1990 and 1993. As for 1994, the same NPA source 
showed me an internal report indicating that more than 900 kilos had been 
seized as of May.  
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan no doubt faces a growing drug-abuse problem. But surely Wu does not 
mean, as his calculations suggest, that one in 25 inhabitants of Taiwan is a 
heroin addict. Wu also attempts a statistical sleight-of-hand: Most of the 
47,836 drug offenders convicted in 1993 abused amphetamines ("ice"), not 
heroin. As for "re-export," yes, it does make sense for a drug trafficker. 
Until recently, at least, Taiwan was less suspect to U.S. Customs as a "port of 
origin" than, say, Thailand.  
</P>
<P>
 Wu asserts that "no political corruption has been uncovered so far." This year 
alone his ministry indicted more than 300 politicians, including 38% of all 
local councilors, in the worst vote-buying scandal in Taiwan's history. Then 
there is the case of a naval officer murdered after uncovering major corruption 
in arms procurement. One year later, tape-recorded evidence has been 
mysteriously erased and multiple investigations have stalled. These cases are 
not related to immigrant smuggling and drugs, but they do point to criminality 
and corruption in high places.  
</P>
<P>
 Multiple revisions and editing resulted in my quoting Ma somewhat out of 
context. What he referred to as happening "a long time ago" was not links 
between organized crime and government in general but the specific example of 
the 1984 murder of journalist Henry Liu, a naturalized U.S. citizen who 
published an unflattering biography of Taiwan's then-President Chiang Chingkuo.

1994 EN CROUTE; L.A., FAMOUS FOR INNOVATION AND JOIE DE FOOD, HAD A 
PARTICULARLY VERVELESS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My year in Los Angeles began shakily. I rolled into town just hours before the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. As soon as the dust settled and I could more or less get 
around, I began working -- that is, eating out six or seven nights a week. I 
had an entire city to learn, but this has always seemed to me the best part 
about moving: that brief moment when everything is still unfamiliar, when 
habits haven't yet had a chance to hijack my sense of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 The days just after the earthquake were filled with possibility. Everyone was 
in the streets. The city was wide open. But most people were not eating out. 
That's why I could waltz into Spago without a reservation or get a table at 
Patina and Citrus on a moment's notice. By the following week, restaurants 
started to fill up again. That's when I began my real eating odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
 I checked out the old places (Musso & Frank, Dan Tana's, Nate n' Al). I tried 
out the gold standards (Valentino, the Grill, La Serenata de Garibaldi). I had 
lunch at the most expensive restaurant in Los Angeles (Ginza Sushi-Ko) and 
found it worth every penny. I dined in strip-mall restaurants (Bombay Cafe, 
Marouch) and noshed on French-dip sandwiches (Philippe the Original and Cole's) 
and steaming tacos folded around chile-doused meats (Yuca's Hut and El Taurino) 
and some of the greatest barbecue ever (Phillip's). Not only did I need to do a 
great deal of remedial eating, I also tracked restaurant openings in what was a 
slow, recessionary year for restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties of commuting while the freeways were down did have one 
positive effect. People began to discover chefs and places in their own 
neighborhoods, such as Louise Branch at Woodside in Brentwood, Josiah Citrin 
and Raphael Lunetta at Jackson's in West Hollywood. Sitting down to a friendly 
place with a small menu just around the corner seemed appealing, and to satisfy 
this new urge, young chefs opened modest venues. I'm thinking of promising 
cooks like Russell Jackson of Russell's and Fred Eric's wacky Vida. Or the 
Beverly Hills reincarnation of Tommy Harase's Franco-Japanese Cafe Blanc, this 
time with Nouveau in front of the name. Even if you are willing to drive, 
moderately priced restaurants are in. Restaurant-goers are looking for value 
(along with a doggie bag). 
</P>
<P>
 No new restaurant has broken into the slim ranks of the top restaurants, not 
this year, not even in the past few years. Valentino, Rex, Patina, Citrus, 
Chinois on Main, Drago and Campanile are beginning to look just a bit lonely up 
there. It says a great deal about the state of fine dining in L.A. when the 
owners of every one of these restaurants (with the exception of Campanile, 
which owns the thriving La Brea Bakery) has opened more informal, less 
expensive places. Piero Selvaggio's moderately priced Posto is in its third 
year in Sherman Oaks; in 1993, Puck launched his chain of Wolfgang Puck's Cafes 
at Universal City's Citywalk. This year, Michel Richard divided Citrus in two 
to create a bargain-priced bistro sidekick to his more expensive 
California-French flagship. Joachim Splichal opted for a classy little lunch 
room called Patinette in front of the Museum of Contemporary Art Downtown. 
Another top restaurateur, John Sedlar, closed his high-flying Bikini and put 
the more casual Abiquiu in the same stylish space with prices about half those 
of Bikini's. Trumps' Michael Roberts created a menu at Twin Palms, a 
400-plus-seat restaurant under two palm trees and a tent in Pasadena (with 
another set for Orange County next year), that just about anyone can afford. 
Appetizers for only $3.75 from a name chef? Who would've thought we'd see the 
day? 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, Celestino Drago cut costs by eliminating main courses and 
concentrating on more inexpensive antipasti, pasta and risotto dishes at Il 
Pastaio. And Mauro Vincenti, who owns the exclusive Rex il Ristorante downtown, 
changed gears entirely when he finally reopened his old Pazzia space in West 
Hollywood as Alto Palato, an earthy trattoria with pasta dishes under $10.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the Bistro Garden, a perennial favorite with the ladies who lunch, has 
stooped to lower prices with their BG to Go in Studio City. But fast food, as 
in BG Souffle in the food court at the Century City Market Place? Amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing hasn't changed. Most readers, I've found, still want to know 
what's trendy or hot. There have been a few splashy openings: House of Blues 
(the tin shack goes palatial), Dive! (the designer submarine sandwich), Country 
Star Restaurant in Universal City (Reba, Winona and Vince Gill bring in the 
fans for some country ribs and chicken). But at these high-concept restaurants, 
it's mostly form over content, much ado about nothing much. 
</P>
<P>
 Trendy? This year we got the new Mortons (bigger, but definitely not better), 
with Drai's in the old l'Ermitage space beginning to edge it out as the place 
to be seen. Eclipse, which took over Mortons' old corner, is definitely a hot 
reservation. What is the draw? Maybe people want to eat in the same room with 
superagent Michael Ovitz. Maybe it's been so long since something truly 
exceptional opened that people think this must be the place. 
</P>
<P>
 The low point of the year was the call I received a few days after the 
Simpson-Goldman murders. The publicist for Mezzaluna, the Brentwood Italian 
restaurant that figures so prominently in the sorry story, called to suggest 
the time might be ripe for a review. I passed. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it has been a cautious year, not only economically, but 
creatively, too. How long can chefs keep cooking the same dishes over and over? 
And how long can we keep eating them? Tuna tartare, smoked salmon, pizza, 
Caesar salad, chopped vegetable salad, angel hair pasta, seared ahi tuna, 
grilled chicken or the ubiquitous Chilean sea bass, creme brulee , tiramisu . . 
. . It's no wonder cooks are asleep at the stove. With menus this monotonous, I 
suspect enthusiastic young chefs are ready to fall on their knives. 
</P>
<P>
 The best openings of the year came from old Los Angeles hands -- Vincenti 
(Alto Palato), Richard (Citrus Bistro) and Jean Francois Meteigner (La 
Cachette). At least mavericks like Eric at Vida and Sam Marvin of Modada, both 
veterans of the club scene, are trying to do something playful and new. But for 
the most part, restaurateurs have adopted a conservatism so myopic, it's hard 
to remember that Los Angeles was once -- not so long ago, in fact -- celebrated 
for its startling and adventurous cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 No one's asking for a rerun of the '80s. Just give us a spark of inspiration. 
I'm convinced it will come. Los Angeles is such an engaged, vibrant city, and 
there are so many dedicated eaters out there ready to brave any obstacle, drive 
any distance, for an interesting meal. The town is just waiting for something 
new. And somebody new. There's still a lot of room at the top.

ALLA BREVE: TRIUMPHANT 'TROVATORE' FROM LEVINE

 VERDI: "Il Trovatore." Placido Domingo, Aprile Millo, Do lora Zajick, Vladimir 
Cher nov, James Morris, others; forces of Metropolitan Opera, James Levine, 
conductor. Sony S2K 48070. This latest addition to the Sony/Verdi/Levine series 
is perhaps the best. Giving the lie to the oom-pah Verdi detractors, the 
conductor brings out all the color, tension and drama of this often problematic 
score with an imaginative use of rubato and an instinctive feel for the right 
accents. In his third Manrico on discs, Domingo has nothing new to say. But the 
sound is fresh and generally impressive, despite some strain in "Di quella 
pira." Millo's voice often sounds worn, but she still can manage some lovely 
piano tone and her coloratura in the duet with the Count is well done. The 
lower voices carry the day. Zajick gives us her whirlwind Azucena, remarkable 
for its disciplined fire. Chernov's Luna, reminiscent of Bastianini's best but 
with even more color and imagination, proves why he is the leading Verdi 
baritone of the day. Morris' Ferrando manages to make the first scene less of a 
bore than it usually is.

 ANNE SOPHIE VON OTTER: Songs by Richard Strauss, Berg and Korngold. Bengt 
Forsberg, piano; Deutsche Grammophon 437 515-2. Just when you despaired that 
with the retirement of Christa Ludwig the tradition of great female Lieder 
singing was dead, along comes Otter to buoy hopes. This splendid voice is in 
its youthful prime and the artist shows an intellectual maturity and curiosity, 
coupled with imagination, which belie her years. The almost erotic calm of "Das 
Rosenband," the unexaggerated humor of "Hat gesagtbleibt's nicht dabei" and the 
languid legato of "Befreit" are highlights of the Strauss, as is the dark mood 
of Berg's "Nacht." The Korngold songs, as music, may not be up to the other two 
composers, but they receive as much serious commitment. Forsberg's inspired 
piano is inseparable from the mezzo's velvet vocalization. Walter Price

 LEOPOLD MOZART: Concerto in D. HUMMEL: Concerto in E-flat. ARUTIUNIAN: 
Concerto. SANDOVAL: Concerto. Arturo Sandoval, trumpet. London Symphony 
Orchestra, conducted by Luis Haza.RCA Victor Red Seal 09026-62661-2. Purists 
may find chinks in the armor of Sandoval's style in the Classical concertos, 
though these are generally elegant and persuasive readings. Haza and the 
orchestra accompany engagingly, but too graciously. In the entertaining 
Khachaturian crib of Arutiunian's Concerto (1950) and in Sandoval's own effort 
-- his first large-scale classical composition, a cosmopolitan, sentimental, 
somewhat cheesy affair -- the Cuban jazz trumpeter takes his gloves off, as it 
were, and gives brash virtuosic performances.

 HAYDN: Symphonies Nos. 45-47; Symphonies Nos. 50, 64, 65. Tafelmusik Ensemble, 
conducted by Bruno Weil. Sony Classical SK 53986 and SK 53985, two separately 
boxed CDs. These are sparkling performances, quick and light-footed and 
dashingly sculpted in the outer movements, delicate and ethereal in the slow, 
and frothy in the minuets. So why complain? It's just that one can't help 
wondering (and longing for) what a Beecham, a Bernstein or a Davis might do 
with these works: the flavorful 47th Symphony, for instance, with its 
march/fanfare opening (much admired by Mozart), an adagio in reversible double 
counterpoint and a minuet that is literally written to be played both forward 
and backward. Weil and the period-instrument Tafelmusik (28-strong at its 
largest) render all of this deftly, but it seems bloodless. Note: These 
recordings bear the imprimatur of Haydn scholar H.C. Robbins Landon, who serves 
as musicological and artistic consultant and informative annotator as well.

SOUND & VISION: SAVAGE OR SENSITIVE -- CHOOSE ONE; DR. DRE, ICE CUBE AND BOYZ 
II MEN ARE POLES APART ON THE MACHO SCALE, BUT REAL CLOSE ON THE S&V SCALE.

 You remember Goofus and Gallant, don't you? These childhood paragons of vice 
and virtue, respectively, have spoken to us for decades from the pages of 
Highlights for Children in the pediatrician's waiting room, teaching right from 
wrong with the most extreme examples. Of course, what kid didn't secretly wish 
to be the thoughtlessly malfeasant Goofus and not that obsequious Gallant? 
</P>
<P>
 The adult choices aren't always much less black and white. Books and seminars 
on "masculinity" today tell us that men grew up without reasonable, balanced 
role models, to explain why all too many wind up veering toward the extremes of 
untempered savagery or inordinately passive sensitivity: the pugilist or the 
pleaser. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us, finally, to this month's spotlighted music videos: 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, partnering on "Natural Born Killaz," indulge in a 
mega-macho kill-spree fantasy that, for cynical kicks, includes loving 
re-enactments of the Simpson-Goldman murders. 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp relief, lover boys Boyz II Men, with "On Bended Knee," enact a please 
-forgive-me-baby scenario so exaggeratedly repentant you'd swear they were 
playing it for laughs, not tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, MTV has its own Goofus and Gallant. One bludgeons, the other blubbers. 
</P>
<P>
 These two role-modeling poles bring up the bottom of this month's Sound & 
Vision column, in which current pop videos are reviewed and rated on a 0-100 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Weezer, "Buddy Holly." "Happy Days" are here again -- quite literally in this 
ingeniously silly clip, which has postmodern Weezer bewigged at Arnold's 
pre-modern '50s malt shop, doing a set for Richie, Joanie, et al. By the 
climax, Fonzie is so moved by this untimely alternative-ness that he breaks 
into a precursor to the break-dance, right in cue with the tune. 
</P>
<P>
 The new photography has been so seamlessly matched with the vintage sitcom 
reaction shots that you may come away with the delusion that Weezer was 
digitally inserted into the '70s footage, when it's just savvy editing. 
(Although, if you're paying attention, diner proprietor Al Molinaro does make a 
cameo in the new stock.) 
</P>
<P>
 Director Spike Jonze (the Beastie Boys' "Sabotage") is making quite the video 
cottage industry out of the '70s; he knows the way to a baby-buster's heart. 81 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Phillips, "Baby I Can't Please You." Though Phillips' 1960s-flavored 
pop-raga lament sounds like a bitter love ballad, it was actually written as a 
metaphoric rag on the American right, whose socially controlling policies, as 
she would have it, mirror a possessive lover's. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer shares her screen time with a surveillance narrative amid scattered 
images of North, Limbaugh, etc. Obvious enough, but this gets confusing when 
the video so often runs under the "Melrose Place" closing credits on Mondays; 
you keep thinking that it's a teaser revealing Jerry Falwell as Amanda's real 
father. 68 
</P>
<P>
 Cranberries, "Zombie." Where U2 left off, the Cranberries mean to pick up, 
with shots of Irish Republican Army-repelling soldiers manning the mean streets 
to let us know that for their divided homeland, the Sunday, bloody Sunday never 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there are the cutaways to a more symbolic motif, with Dolores 
O'Riordan aglitter in front of a cross, surrounded by arrow-wielding cherubim, 
all spray-painted silver. Someone might have warned the singer that there are 
more communicative ways to deliver such a soberly intended message than adorned 
with full body paint. We're supposed to be mourning the fighting Irish, but all 
O'Riordan can make us think of is . . . Gold- fing -uhh! 54 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna, "Take a Bow." Madonna and a Spanish bullfighter (played by a real 
Spanish bullfighter and not Antonio Banderas, to her chagrin, we're sure) 
indulge in a tragic love affair. So tragic that she takes to watching his bouts 
on TV while she writhes in bed and takes a bow toward her own nether regions. 
In the silliest shot, she actually pulls the sheet over herself and the TV set. 
</P>
<P>
 Less sexy still is the flashback sex sequence, which juxtaposes the 
sword-wielding bullfighter's brutal penetration of his adversary with, uh . . . 
well, you know. Montage -- you gotta love it. 52 
</P>
<P>
 Mariah Carey, "All I Want for Christmas." There's a reason this video has no 
director credit: It's literally last year's home movies. By now, most of us 
have accidentally taped a "Seinfeld" episode over the video preserving the 
previous Christmas' present opening; not Carey, who eschews lip-syncing in 
favor of random scenes of snow rollicking and gift unwrapping. We're not quite 
sure whether it's impressive or scary that she looks as phenomenal (and preens 
as much) on an actual Christmas morning as on a studio shoot. 45 
</P>
<P>
 Boyz II Men, "On Bended Knee." A little apology goes a long way -- but not 
with these four, who milk penitence past the point of simpering. It's the 
ultimate pre-feminist female fantasy: Four fellahs who've done nothing worse 
than concentrate on work, at the expense of nurturing relationships, beg 
forgiveness from their significant others for not having been as sensitive as 
they ought, collectively uttering please more times than James Brown ever 
dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 Many knees are bent, a few tears are shed, and the Boyz vie for the title of 
the ultimate "chick band." Get thee to a sweat lodge? 39 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, "Natural Born Killaz." At last, these two star rappers 
have given O. J. Simpson the alibi he needs: We did it. (Uh, thanks, guys, and 
we're sure Robert Shapiro will be in touch.) 
</P>
<P>
 But seriously, folks: True, we've been so saturated with the shock value of 
these two portraying themselves slaughtering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman that it barely registers as distasteful anymore. But their thundering 
insensitivity is still worth the small modicum of outrage we can muster at this 
desensitized late date. 
</P>
<P>
 Cube and Dre can claim till the cows come home that they're doing a topical 
take on Oliver Stone territory. But if it were their family, would it be so 
funny to see, say, Glenn Danzig and the Slayer dude pretending to gut the loved 
ones? 3

THE CHARTS: PEARL JAM RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KROQ's Christmas tape, "No Toys For O.J.," wiped out nearly all the 
competition on the Times' Southern California pop album chart, debuting at No. 
2. It wasn't quite up to the Pearl Jam challenge though, with that group's 
"Vitalogy" resoundingly topping the chart. The KROQ tape sold 42,000 copies 
(proceeds go to charity), which was also good enough to place it at No. 57 on 
the national chart. Available only at Wherehouse outlets and priced at just 
$1.67, the tape is a combination of Christmas songs and celebrity chit-chat 
with DJs Kevin and Bean. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,39,11 Title, Artist (Nat'l Rank)

RECORD RACK: 'SWEETEST' SOUNDS FROM WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jean Rosenbluth 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 VANESSA WILLIAMS, "The Sweetest Days" ( Wing / Mercury ) ***1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Not many artists recording for a major label are in a position to chuck 
concerns about commercial viability out the window and make an album that 
doesn't pander -- not even just a track or two -- to the target audience. With 
a blooming Broadway career to fall back on, Williams has that rare luxury, and 
she has used it to glorious advantage on her third album. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that by seemingly ignoring all considerations of what the 
marketplace wants, Williams has created a collection of songs that consumers 
may well eat up. A jazzy thread runs through most of the album, emerging boldly 
on the swinging "EllaMental," a clever, hip-hop-tinged tribute to Ella 
Fitzgerald, and on "Sister Moon," featuring the song's originator, Sting, on 
backing vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has previously remained in the safe middle reaches of her voice, but 
she ventures into the lower registers on the sultry "Betcha Never," an 
infectious, danger-flecked number written and produced by Babyface. Best of all 
is the stark "Higher Ground" -- mostly just some airy acoustic guitar and a 
justifiably self-assured-sounding Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 Barry Manilow, "Singin' With the Big Bands," (***) Arista. Flashing exemplary 
big-band crooner form, Manilow glides through swing favorites, wisely using the 
original arrangements (with a stronger rhythm-section emphasis).He's smoothly 
supported by current editions of famous bands on what is easily his finest 
album.

 The London Suede, "dog man star," (**) Columbia. If Nirvana's version of "The 
Man Who Sold the World" made you want to know more about early David Bowie, 
this English band's second album will clue you in to the lush sound and 
decadent aura just fine.But if you want the invention and emotion, stick with 
the real thing. Suede's 1993 debut held promise, but this one looks backward 
instead of forward.

 PIZZICATO FIVE, "Made in USA" ( Matador ) ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I am unreliable, capricious, cheeky, willful, luxurious, affected, lying, 
dubious and random. But I am allowed because I am cute. But I am loved because 
I am cute.  
</P>
<P>
 With lyrics like those, who needs a record reviewer? 
</P>
<P>
 This decade-old Tokyo trio arrives via America's alternative-rock label of the 
moment, but don't come looking for more than a novelty kick and surface appeal. 
In fact, this album is virtually all surfaces -- texture-free, brightly lit 
space-age surfaces of white plastic and chrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizzicato Five's shamelessly synthetic, swingin' jingles encompass styles from 
spy film score to diluted jazz, disco to go-go, lounge-pop to Burt Bacharach 
pop. There are plush, ABBA wannabe productions and a Sly & the Family 
Stone-quoting soul number whose whole point is its soullessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Maki Nomiya sings celebrations of Western pop culture ("Twiggy vs. James 
Bond") and enigmatic love lyrics mostly in Japanese, with translations into 
endearingly fractured English provided in the CD booklet. It's only 
sporadically as much fun as all this sounds, but at its most effective, 
Pizzicato Five's meta-Muzak conjures a digital dreamland where you might find 
people doing the twist in supermarket aisles. Way cute. 
</P>

 Ice Cube, "Bootlegs & B-Sides," (**) Street Knowledge/Priority. Did we really 
need a remix of Ice Cube's weakest single to date, "You Know How We Do It"? 
This lackluster, partly superfluous collection includes B-sides, remixes and 
three new songs, but only one of the new ones, the fiery "You Don't Wanna ---- 
With These," comes close to Cube at his best.

holidays to help set up the manger, a family tradition in his Mexican town. 
He'll miss out on Las Posadas, a religious ritual.But, most of all, in an 
inscription in a teddy bear-shaped card he crafted for his grandmother, Gabriel 
expresses how he'll miss just being at her side. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel, who emigrated with his mother from Puebla eight months ago, isn't 
alone in his separation from loved ones during this family season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow classmates in Deanna Brantley's Introduction to English Reading at 
Belmont High School's Newcomer's Center -- for students who have just arrived 
in this country -- have used glitter and sequins, metallic snowflakes and 
cotton, and colorful ribbon and foil to create exquisite holiday cards for 
mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, and other family members in foreign 
lands they hope to be reunited with next Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cards are a way for students to connect with the people in their lives 
they have left behind," Brantley says. "Some of these kids have come here with 
nobody and have come to nobody. There is a sweetness in their souls that you 
don't see a lot with kids who have had everything."MICHAEL QUINTANILLA

HOT, SEXY AND (ALMOST) 70; HE'S PLAYED A ROGUE'S GALLERY OF RASCALS THROUGHOUT 
HIS 38-YEAR MOVIE CAREER, BUT SOMEHOW, WITH PAUL NEWMAN IN THE ROLE, THEY CAN'T 
HELP BUT BECOME HEROES. HOW DOES HE DO THAT? 
</P>

<P>
 Above the mantelpiece of the huge field-stone fireplace in the converted barn 
on Paul Newman's Connecticut acres hangs a grand and garish poster of Buffalo 
Bill on horseback. It was a set decoration in the showman's office in Robert 
Altman's film "Buffalo Bill and the Indians," in which Newman starred in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immediately after the film was over I hustled the picture out of there," 
Newman remarked a few days ago. "About four months later I got a note from 
Altman, saying he'd wanted the picture himself. I said, 'Bob, that's the only 
heroic guy I've ever been seen as, and I made up my mind I was gonna stick that 
thing up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that while Newman has always borne a close resemblance to a Greek 
god, and at the age of 69 still does (showing almost no signs of wear and 
care), he has played an inordinate number of what one writer called "flawed 
rakes." ("I would take ownership of the phrase," Newman says admiringly.) 
</P>
<P>
 Newman certainly has been seen as good and perhaps heroic figures. His Rocky 
Graziano in "Somebody Up There Likes Me" in 1956 established him indisputably 
as a movie star, but most of his good guy roles fade before the lingering 
luminescence of the rascal or worse he was in, for examples, "Hud," "Hombre," 
"The Hustler," "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," "Sweet Bird of Youth, "Cool Hand Luke," 
the alcoholic, burnt-out lawyer who finds redemption in "The Verdict" and more 
recently the comically villainous business executive in the Coen brothers' "The 
Hudsucker Proxy." 
</P>
<P>
 The paradox is that Newman, more than almost any actor of his long generation, 
somehow can't help being attractive and sympathetic even when by all that is 
good and holy he shouldn't be. In "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," both he 
and Robert Redford were in the great tradition of lovable rogues, and when 
their law-breaking pasts caught up with them in a hail of Bolivian gunfire, 
there was no satisfying sense that justice had been properly done, only a glum 
regret that there wouldn't be a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman once complained that in one of his nastiest roles, as the callously 
insensitive Hud, he tried to be as unsympathetic as he could, hoping the 
audience would leave, as he told an English interviewer, with "loathing and 
disgust; instead we created a folk hero." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Cool Hand Luke" in 1967, he was the epitome of the '60s anti-hero, 
free-spirited and defiantly, fatally self-destructive. He was not by definition 
a tragic figure, yet he invested his prankster with a kind of tragic nobility 
that heightened the indictment of an oppressive justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a glorious fall day in the Connecticut countryside, the sky cloudless, a 
brisk breeze stripping the last leaves from the trees. Newman does not much 
like interviews, except insofar as he can talk about Hollywood, movies 
generally, societal matters, practically anything except Paul Newman. This 
morning, he says, he is lethargic with anger over the election two days before. 
It is a "damn-both-your-houses" anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loyalty to party, loyalty to the whole community, they've been replaced by 
deification of the individual. That's why Congress couldn't get anything done. 
No one would get behind anybody else because everybody wanted authorship. I can 
only assume or hope that the Republicans will learn from this and be cohesive 
enough to get something done. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two things that make me sweat: live television and government." 
</P>
<P>
 But to the business at hand, and Newman is now back again at the business of 
being a flawed rake in need of redemption in Robert Benton's "Nobody's Fool," 
set in small-town Upstate New York and based on a novel by Richard Russo. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is a kind of socially realistic fable, charming and offbeat, in which 
Newman plays a construction worker who has abandoned wife and now-grown son, 
boards with one of his grade-school teachers (Jessica Tandy in her last, fine 
role), drinks a tad too much, plays cards with his luckless lawyer, flirts a 
little (avoiding any threat of commitment) and is generally the charming 
wastrel he ever was. The film opens on Christmas Day in New York and Los 
Angeles, for Oscar consideration, naturally, and will go wide in February. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes the film a lot, which is not invariably true of actors contemplating 
the vehicle in which they have worked. "It has a human dimension, which is 
getting to be rare in films these days," Newman said, sitting in the barn, 
which is a few yards down the yard from his house and contains a projection 
room and a small kitchen and is filled with family photographs and mementos of 
his racing activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The film "has patience, it has courage; it's content to let things unfold in 
whatever human ways they unfold, without worrying about the clock in the 
cutting room," Newman says, pausing between words, trying, as is his custom, to 
say just what he means. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thrust of the film is the development of the characters. It's about a guy 
becoming accessible. Where a guy's going to go emotionally is less predictable 
than when you have a very strong plot line -- a man's gotta get the money by a 
certain time, that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Tandy was already ailing with cancer when she made "Nobody's Fool." 
"She seemed fragile," he says sadly, "but she was a big presence. There was as 
always something patrician about her attitude, and she never gave any outward 
indication of whatever turmoil was going on. She was tranquilizing for all of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 On the making of the film: "I keep thinking nostalgia ain't what it used to 
be, but it is. I remember when you had a stable of actors at a studio and you 
started with the first scene, and then you shot the second scene, and then you 
shot the third scene, and finally on the last day of shooting you shot the last 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you shoot the last scene the week after you've started, and people get 
shuffled in and out because they've only got nine days and everything is out of 
sequence. And how the film comes together in some semblance of emotional 
buildup is something of a puzzle. You go on instinct a lot. You take the plan, 
the script, and eliminate the organization and maybe it works better that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The miracle of good film acting is that, even when it is done in sequence, as 
it almost never is any more, the performance is a mosaic of very small shards, 
most only a few seconds long. Yet if it works, the portrayal not only has a 
beginning, a middle and an end (ideally of rising interest and impact), it also 
has a naturalness and a seeming spontaneity that never suggests an actor has 
been acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, trudging through the snow in the fictional North Bath, N.Y. (actually 
Beacon, N.Y., near the Hudson River), is indubitably Paul Newman, and a welcome 
sight, too; but he has become Sully Sullivan, a man with a troubled past and a 
problematic future which are all Sullivan's. The actor's identity, although not 
his presence, has disappeared within the creation. The process is what makes 
superstars, and Newman, who has been at it for 40 years, remains one of the 
handful. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Joanne Woodward, whom he met in 1953, had the great luck of 
coming on-stream as actors in a rich time for the theater and, even more 
excitingly, in the first years of live television, when everything seemed 
possible, or at least worth trying.  
</P>
<P>
 Newman, having been a radio gunner on a Navy torpedo bomber in World War II, 
had returned to graduate from Kenyon College and took another year realizing he 
had no heart for the family clothing business in Cleveland. He did summer stock 
in Illinois, attended the Yale Drama School and then tackled Broadway, making a 
strong first impression in 1953 in William Inge's "Picnic." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was such terrific writing being done: Tennessee Williams, Arthur 
Miller, Albee, Inge. And live television was uncovered ground, unexplored 
territory," Newman remembers. "And however crude the shows were by today's 
standards, that whole era of kitchen-sink drama, which replaced the Group 
Theater stuff, was just beginning to open up. Paddy Chayefsky was writing, a 
whole lot of great guys." 
</P>
<P>
 But, being live television, it meant there were no second chances. "I remember 
I was doing an Army drama and I had nine changes and no time to do any of them. 
I heard my cue and still didn't have my pants zipped. I buttoned the top button 
and ran into the set. The officer was Jim Gregory, a wonderful actor, and he 
saw right away that my fly was unzipped and my shirt was sticking out. I said 
'Sir!' and tried to hold my hands in front of my pants. He'd never saluted me, 
but he did now, so I had to salute him back, revealing my difficulties." Newman 
laughed. "Wicked." 
</P>
<P>
 He did a musical version of "Our Town," one of NBC's first color 
transmissions, with Frank Sinatra as the stage manager and Eva Marie Saint as 
Newman's co-star. "It's a great piece of Americana, but I'll tell you 
something: I'm not much of a singer, and they wanted me to harmonize and 
somewhere I lost the harmony and never found it again. But you couldn't retape 
it; it was all there." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971 the Newmans bought a 1739 farmhouse in exurban Connecticut as a summer 
house. They had lived in a variety of houses in California (22 in their years 
there, Newman estimates) and they have a New York apartment. But the 
Connecticut place, with a small but fishable river running behind it, pleased 
them increasingly. Newman dreaded the possibility of a glassy modern house 
being built on the greensward across the river and sought to buy some acreage 
from the woman who owned the estate. The owner said she would only sell the 
whole property, and several years later she was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get two appraisals made and I'll get two made and we'll add 'em up and 
divide by four and I'll write you a check," Newman said, and did. He had a 
footbridge built over the river, the Aspetuck, after a tussle with the township 
over how high the 100-year high-water mark was. It links the two properties, 
and the summer house is now the guest house. At the edge of the lawn of the 
guest house stands a large tombstone Newman gave the children one Christmas, 
carved with the names of all the deceased family pets, cats, dogs, horses and 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The salad dressing that was the beginning of the Newman's Own charitable 
enterprise was first made in the barn, in what had once been the stables. "I'm 
not sure what the Food and Drug Administration would have said if they'd known 
that," Newman said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman's Own, launched in 1982 on an initial investment of $20,000 and 
administered by Ursula Hotchner, the wife of writer A. E. Hotchner, who 
co-founded the company with Newman, has through this summer donated $60 million 
in profits to something like 400 charitable causes here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The product line, which has expanded beyond salad dressing to include popcorn 
and spaghetti sauces, recently expanded again with the formation of Newman's 
Own Second Generation organic pretzels, made by a California subsidiary 
launched by Newman's daughter Nell. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman's Own is not only sending millions to good causes, it is also creating 
jobs. "We've got two plants here that make the spaghetti sauce, plus one in 
Europe, plus one in Australia," Newman says, "and we've got two bottlers for 
the salad dressing. You know our slogan: 'Shameless exploitation in pursuit of 
the common good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer at a fund-raiser for the first Hole in the Wall Gang summer camp 
for children with life-threatening diseases at Ashford, Conn., Newman himself 
played Sneezy in a very special version of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." 
Hotchner wrote the adaptation, which was narrated by Joan Rivers. "Melanie 
(Griffith) took the red-eye in from the coast to be in it," Newman says. She 
shared a dual Wicked Queen role with dancer Ann Reinking.  
</P>
<P>
 Critic Gene Shalit was Grumpy, Tony Randall was Happy and Hotchner himself 
played Bashful. David Letterman made a surprise appearance. "I was the only one 
in the cast who didn't know he was going to be there," Newman says. "You could 
have driven a railroad car through my mouth. It was a lot of talent for a 
225-seat house. We called it the longest run in Ashford history." 
</P>
<P>
 There are four more camps open or under construction, in New York State, 
Florida, France and Ireland. "But they're not the major preoccupation of the 
company. We scatter the profits all over the 50 states." 
</P>
<P>
 To his regret, Newman has had to end his career as a race driver. "I'm just a 
little long in the tooth for it anymore," he says. An enthusiasm fired by his 
role in "Winning" in 1969, Newman found that competitive driving energized his 
whole life and made the spaces between films not only bearable but enjoyable. 
"I just like winning," he once told an English reporter. "I despise that primal 
urge in myself, but it's really all there is." Woodward, however, who hated the 
Angst when he was off at the races, made him a pillow that reads, "Winning 
isn't everything; it's how you played the game." 
</P>
<P>
 He will continue to co-sponsor his racing team, however, in partnership with 
Chicago businessman Carl Haas. They imported British driver Nigel Mansell, who 
was the Indy car driver of the year in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we didn't win a race, not a single race, this year," Newman says. Mansell 
decided to abandon Indy cars to go back to the Formula One cars that compete on 
the Grand Prix circuit. "Michael Andretti is coming to race with us, and Paul 
Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, who has proved himself a first-rate director with "Rachel, Rachel," 
"The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds" and "The Glass 
Menagerie," all starring his wife, has been developing another project he would 
like to direct. But, he says, it's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting something accomplished now seems to depend more on the concept of 
banking than it does on the concept of literature, or the screenplay. And 
that's a tough kind of situation because you can't gather yourself up and get 
momentum. You can't say it's done and let's get on with it. They say wait a 
minute. You keep waiting for any number of people to say yes. This guy says 
yes, but that guy's gotta say yes and this guy's gotta say yes and that guy's 
gotta say yes, and if anybody gets left out of the loop, including the guy who 
takes care of the weather reports, then it's hard to put it together." 
</P>
<P>
 He worries about the difficulty of finding the human dimension in scripts and 
films. He is also uneasy about the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Pulp Fiction' is marvelously inventive and eccentric. But I don't know what 
to do with the violence anymore. I mean, there's a difference between the 
cartoon violence in 'Slap Shot' (the film about minor league hockey Newman did 
in 1977), for instance, which was violent but truly in a cartoon sense. But 
it's one thing to make fun of guys who are slugging each other on the ice, and 
another thing to use comedy to ameliorate the brutality of a guy getting his 
head blown off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly the theater of the senses now, as compared to the theater of 
the mind. They escalate the sensory impact of films now, the noise of them, the 
violence of them, the sensuality of them, and where will it end? In the 
Westerns of the '30s, the sheriff shot the villain at the finish. Now he's not 
even remotely right unless he has 88 corpses at the beginning of the picture, 
just to show that he has the proper intentions. It's a score card: Sheriff, 344 
bad guys; bad guys, 12 good guys; a few offside penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman is fascinated by the possibility of sequels. "You know, you get hold of 
a character you like and you say, 'Why don't we go back and take a look at what 
he's doing 25 years later, as in 'The Color of Money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart Stern wrote "Rachel, Rachel," with Woodward as a spinster 
schoolteacher in a New England town, and it won four Oscar nominations, for 
best picture and for Stern, Woodward and Estelle Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
 "So Stewart and I tried to write this sequel. Stewart and his wife live in 
Seattle. Joanne and I went up to see them a while ago. He's a docent at the zoo 
and he's got his own gorilla. Did you ever try to feed a 400-pound gorilla with 
a spoon?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, Newman says, wrote two wonderful scenes for a sequel. In one, Woodward 
is taking a ballet class with several other middle-aged women. A friend comes 
to the door of the classroom and mimes to Woodward, "Your mother's dead." 
(Mother was always a problem.) In the next scene, back at the house awaiting 
the undertaker, Woodward's sister says, "You take care of the dog; I'll take 
care of mother." Stewart and Newman even imagined a denouement in Africa. 
"Wonderful, wonderful idea," Newman says, "but we could just never finish it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, Newman says wryly, "It's in the nature of us old birds to complain 
about the generation that follows us. But you can't have good theater without 
good audiences, just as you can't have good literature or good pictures without 
good audiences, and I don't know where the audiences are now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are just two straight plays on Broadway. Many of the theaters 
are dark. But you've got all these wide-eyed kids coming out of Yale, 
Juilliard, Northwestern, and now the Actors Studio has a course at the New 
School. What the hell are they all going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, like all serious and dedicated actors, lives to work at his craft. 
Enjoyable as the life of a country squire is and satisfying as the good works 
are that Newman's Own makes possible, there is nothing like a good part, like 
Sully in "Nobody's Fool."  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of humor in it," Newman says. "I hope it comes through."*

DEVALUATION OF 'THE NUT'; IT'S A HOLIDAY TRADITION AND A CASH COW TOO. BUT HAVE 
ALL THOSE SUGARPLUM FAIRIES AND WALTZING FLOWERS PRODUCED A 'NUTCRACKER' GLUT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Breslauer, Jan Breslauer is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no secret that "The Nutcracker" has long been the cash cow of the ballet 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Christmas crunch is to retailers, the Tchaikovsky chestnut is to 
ballet companies. Since before there were Santas in shopping malls, troupes 
have been making nearly half of their annual nut (so to speak) off a couple of 
weeks' worth of sugarplums. 
</P>
<P>
 But "The Nutcracker" is becoming a tough nut to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that there's been a boom in "Nutcrackers," with 
seemingly everyone and his elves getting into the act. Mainstream outfits both 
large and small, foreign and domestic, all do it. And even the more venturesome 
or contemporary companies -- inspired perhaps by the success of 
choreographer-dancer Mark Morris' "Hard Nut" -- have been tossing their tutus 
into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of talk about the proliferation," says the Joffrey Ballet's 
executive director, C. C. Conner. "Some companies say the take from 'The Nut' 
is not as good as it once was, though we're still filling well." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles alone will see at least 10 stagings of the holiday warhorse this 
season, ranging from two Moscow-based bus-and-truck versions to the more modest 
offerings of such local outfits as the West Valley Ballet and the Westside 
Ballet. (And that's not even counting last week's one-night stand of 
"Nutcracker on Ice.") 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably the most visible version opens this week, when the Joffrey Ballet 
brings "The Nutcracker" to the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
Wednesday through Dec. 30. Meanwhile, notable continuing productions include 
stagings by Los Angeles Classical Ballet at Long Beach Convention and 
Entertainment Center and Pasadena Dance Theatre at San Gabriel Civic 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 There are couch-potato "Nutcrackers" too. Last season alone there were at 
least seven TV versions for diligent cable cruisers, and there are likely to be 
as many or more this year. On video, there's the just-out Balanchine and New 
York City Ballet tape and half a dozen others for the renting. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet ironically, even if -- or perhaps because -- "Nutcrackers" are multiplying 
like Tribbles, it doesn't seem to be the fiscal quick fix for ballet companies 
it once was. Major companies such as the American Ballet Theatre have canceled 
engagements, citing slow ticket sales, and resident groups also have been 
scrambling for audiences. The situation surely reflects the financial woes 
afflicting nearly all dance companies today, as more and more groups struggle 
to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be an artistic downside as well. More "Nutcrackers," after all, 
is not necessarily better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is trying to do their version, but the value has been diminished," 
says Pasadena Dance Theatre's artistic director, Charles Maple. "There are a 
lot out there that really are not up to snuff." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, in a faraway land filled with stolid toy soldiers and fluffy 
dancing snowflakes, "The Nutcracker" could be counted on to underwrite the 
annual seasons of little ballet companies everywhere. Once the initial costs of 
costume and sets were amortized, it would typically bring in 40% to 70% of a 
troupe's annual earned income. 
</P>
<P>
 That held true for decades, especially for non-touring companies based outside 
major cities, where their "Nut" was likely to be the only game in town. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1970s, an increase in performing arts touring facilitated by 
programs run by the National Endowment for the Arts and other government 
agencies changed the situation somewhat. Small- and mid-size cities -- as well 
as big cities without resident companies -- could afford to bring in snazzier 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, however, those subsidies were cut back. Fewer companies 
could afford to tour, and fewer presenters had the wherewithal to offer 
profitable gigs. And as the 1980s continued and the recession hit full swing, 
these conditions were exacerbated. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest of the big ballets, such as the American Ballet Theatre and the 
Joffrey, have of course always remained somewhat outside this scenario -- 
though even they are apparently no longer immune to the greater economic 
currents affecting the arts these days. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mikhail Baryshnikov left ABT in 1990 -- taking the rights to his 
production with him -- the group was left without a "Nut" to call its own. And 
by 1991, ABT was in serious financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until last year that, after changes in administration, the company 
had the resources to premiere a new "Nutcracker," which it did in Orange 
County, later restaging the work in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 ABT officials say that things have gotten better. However, the "Nutcracker" 
that the troupe was to have performed from last Monday to next Saturday in 
Purchase, N.Y., was recently canceled because of poor ticket sales. Purchase is 
precisely the kind of middle-class, arts-oriented college town where dance -- 
ABT dance, in particular -- should be a comparatively easy sell. 
</P>
<P>
 But ABT says the slow sales really weren't a reflection of the increasingly 
difficult "Nutcracker" marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We announced it as an element of a multifaceted agreement between ABT and the 
arts center there," says company spokesman Robert Pontarelli. "There was a 
hesitancy to announce 'The Nutcracker' until all of the details were worked 
out, so the marketing didn't really begin until mid-October. It simply was not 
enough time." 
</P>
<P>
 The action was also a defensive move, Pontarelli says: "ABT has made 
incredible strides in the past two years in fiscal health, and this could have 
put that in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 (In a similarly defensive move, ABT also nixed its planned January dates in 
San Diego, where the bill was to include Kenneth MacMillan's full-evening 
"Manon" and repertory works.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Joffrey is going ahead with its "Nutcracker" visit, that company 
has also canceled dates recently. Earlier this month, it bailed on a planned 
April tour that would have included dates at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Like ABT, the Joffrey claims comparative, if not absolute, fiscal health. The 
company made a significant profit off last year's touring engagements of the 
Prince-scored ballet "Billboards," which has already been performed twice at 
the Music Center, once at OCPAC, and would have been on tap for OCPAC in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales in the last year were good, and earned income was higher last year 
thanks to 'Billboards,' " says the Joffrey's Conner. In fact, in absolute 
dollars earned, it surpassed even "The Nutcracker," although in profitability 
per week, "it doesn't make that much difference," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like ABT, the Joffrey Ballet's "Nutcracker" is subject to the ups and downs of 
touring economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the anomaly in the 'Nutcracker' business," Conner says. "It's different 
because we do 'The Nut' on tour." 
</P>
<P>
 The paradox is that not that much pain means not that much potential gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most companies are presenting at home, so they take all the risk and all the 
profit," he says. "Since we're touring, we get paid a guaranteed fee, so the 
box-office risk is not the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's no way for the Joffrey to make a touring "Nutcracker" the money 
font it once was for hometown troupes. "It sells well, but we have expenses 
that most other companies don't have -- per diem, trucking and freight bills," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if the conditions are right, the "Nut" still turns a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, it's five weeks of work," says Conner, whose company mounted its 
first "Nutcracker" in 1987. "We're doing about as long a 'Nutcracker' season as 
one can do. It's probably 40% of our earned income." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1980s, L.A. played host both to large touring productions of 
"The Nutcracker" and smaller, local versions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, David Wilcox's Los Angeles Classical Ballet entered the field, 
proffering a traditionally styled interpretation. Surprisingly, though, the 
presence of imported competition hasn't hurt this outfit's take. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1984, we were the only big 'Nutcracker,' " Wilcox says. "Then ABT came 
into town in 1985 and our ticket sales went up. Then the Joffrey came in '86 
and our ticket sales went up again." 
</P>
<P>
 That's an encouraging sign, he says: "I don't think there is a limited 
audience. The more you have, the more audience you create. Every time more 
'Nuts' came to town, our ticket sales went up." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the audience expanded to the previously uninitiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year about 50% of our audience was new," Wilcox says. "This year, we 
have all these 'Nutcrackers' and our ticket sales are up like 20% over last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet things aren't all rosy for L.A. Classical. The company hadn't performed at 
all this year until now. Nor has the money that has been made from "Nutcracker" 
performances been enough to finance other works the way it once did. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Classical Ballet may be a "Nutcracker"-only company this year, but that 
wasn't always the case. The group used to perform during the year, then 
stopped. "The recession hit," Wilcox says, "which is why we cut back." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Nutcracker' is the only ballet that cannot lose a lot of money," he 
says. "It's always going to be the bread and butter." 
</P>
<P>
 In previous active years, the take from "The Nutcracker" represented about 
half of L.A. Classical's annual income. This year, with contributions down, 
they're looking for it to provide about 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilcox hopes that other new productions will help carry the earned income 
load in the future. "We're looking at a big new production of 'Cinderella' in 
the fall -- something that will surpass our 'Nutcracker' in bringing ballet to 
the wide audience it deserves." 
</P>
<P>
 A former "Nutcracker"-only company that's branching out -- and counting on the 
'Nut' to bankroll the expansion -- is the Pasadena Dance Theatre, which has 
presented an annual "Nutcracker" for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was really the only production the group did -- until this year, that is. 
"Before we became professional, it was 100% of our earned income," says 
Pasadena Dance Theatre's Maple. "This is the first year we're adding in a full 
season, and 'The Nutcracker' is definitely a key element, probably about 
70%-75% (of projected income). And we still need to raise about $100,000 more 
on top of that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Maple thinks his group is poised to nab a hefty share of the market. "What 
makes our version special is that it is the original American version 
choreographed by Willam Christensen in 1944," he says of the version, which is 
also in use by the San Francisco Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Christensen has reviewed the choreography. Our associate director, 
Cynthia Young, used to dance with Christensen, and she sets it each year to 
make sure everything is just the way it was. It's the authentic choreography." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every L.A. production, however, is so enamored of tradition. The recent 
Los Angeles Chamber Ballet staging at Cal State L.A.'s Luckman Fine Arts 
Complex, for example, strayed from the tried and true into terrain of the 
group's often-innovative aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Troupe leaders knew they couldn't go too far out into left field, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to be imaginative and yet stay in the arena of what was 
traditional," L.A. Chamber Ballet co-founder Raiford Rogers says of the 
staging, which mixed extravagant Neo-Expressionist costumes with a fairly 
conventional narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost become this religious ceremony, and you have to be careful with 
it," he says. "You can do a novelty 'Nutcracker' and people would look at it 
once, but they might not want to return." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are those who have wondered what a hip group like L.A. 
Chamber would be doing with "The Nutcracker" in the first place. But the 
reasons, alas, were financial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd been asked by our booking agents for years to do a 'Nutcracker' and we 
waited 13 years to do one," Rogers says. "Actually, I expected to get a lot 
more grief about it from some of my friends or supporters of the ballet." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the take isn't what it used to be, it's still something to count 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the booking possibilities have been down in recent years, the one 
that seems to be holding steady is 'The Nutcracker,' " Rogers says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt there was a place for us because the major ballet companies' 
'Nutcrackers' are not affordable."  
</P>
<P>
 And it helps keep the company alive in other ways too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for an anchor to generate work for our dancers," Rogers says. 
"It was something that we had to do, because if you don't, your dancers will be 
contracted elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 So with the new production up on its feet for the first time and the event 
recorded on videotape, all that's left for L.A. Chamber is to secure the 
bookings. "This year our only objective was to create a 'Nut,' because people 
won't book it unless they see it," Rogers says. 
</P>
<P>
 He and colleagues hope it will pay off and keep the company afloat -- because 
mounting a new "Nutcracker" is no cakewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an enormous amount of work," Rogers quips. "There's a reason why they 
call it 'The Nutcracker.' "*

THESE MOUSE CLUBS AREN'T FOR MICKEY; FANS CAN CHAT WITH R.E.M'S MICHAEL STIPE, 
TELL CONAN O'BRIEN WHAT THEY THINK OF HIS JOKES AND EXPLORE THE SUBJECT OF 
PATRICK STEWART'S BALDNESS -- IF THEY'RE ON-LINE, THAT IS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By P. J. Huffstutter, P. J. Huffstutter (pjhuff1@AOL.com) is a San Diego-based 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last July, R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe turned on a personal computer and 
chatted with 900,000 of his closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking occasional breaks from recording "Monster" at Ocean Way Studio in 
Hollywood, Stipe used an America Online account -- stipey@aol.com -- to post 
e-mail comments to an R.E.M. newsgroup. AOL subscribers could join in or merely 
watch as Stipe spent a week clearing up debates over song lyrics and 
entertaining system users with anecdotes from past tours. 
</P>
<P>
 When one R.E.M. fan suggested that the band perform at Detroit's Fox Theatre, 
Stipe answered in the casual style of e-mail, where there is rarely 
capitalization and minimal punctuation: "we recall being at the fox with 
campervb (the band Camper Van Beethoven) 'cause i remember climbing to the top 
and looking down after everybody left we were drunk. the mats (the 
Replacements) too. they took off their shirts after one song 'if i only had a 
brain' and stole our cognac." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the studio," Stipe, 34, recently recalled, "and bored with being 
there. Someone suggested I try out the computer. I was surprised that I really 
enjoyed (the experience)." 
</P>
<P>
 Stipe isn't the only celebrity connecting with the masses on-line. Users can 
scroll through Hole singer Courtney Love's rantings against her father or send 
e-mail to the band members of Sonic Youth. The staff at "Late Night With Conan 
O'Brien" occasionally uses the Internet to see what people think about the 
show. The creator of the sci-fi TV series "Babylon 5" spends hours each day 
chatting on the Infobahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Such incidents are the first stages in a unique marriage between show business 
and the public. The question is: Does the 'Net merely offer another kind of fan 
club -- albeit a high-tech one -- or has it forged a greater degree of intimacy 
between celebrities and fans? 
</P>
<P>
 Name a performer and chances are there's a newsgroup devoted to that person's 
private and professional life. These are not the officially sanctioned on-line 
exchanges arranged with commercial services, such as David Bowie popping onto 
America Online, Tom Petty on Prodigy or the Rolling Stones on Delphi. These are 
freewheeling conversations about or with celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial services offer their own version of a newsgroup. Often called a 
"topic," "folder" or "arena," they act as in-house, local bulletin boards for 
fans. True newsgroups, however, are found on Usenet, the world's largest 
distributed bulletin board system, which acts as a "store-and-forward" network 
for sites both on and off the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nearly impossible to pinpoint the number of people who have access to the 
Usenet, because the Internet is growing so rapidly and many people can share 
the same computer terminal. Still, Usenet followers estimate that about 10 
million computers are on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsgroups have multi-part names separated by periods, such as 
alt.fan.monty-python , a group devoted to the British comedy troupe. Most 
groups that focus on pop culture figures begin with the word rec for 
"recreation" or alt for "alternate." A multitude of fan-oriented newsgroups 
exists, ranging from an anti-Barney faction ( 
alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die ) to Patrick Stewart groupies ( 
alt.sexy.bald.captains ). 
</P>
<P>
 Users tend to select a few groups to read and ignore the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I view newsgroups like this: Do you know that in some places in America, 
there are 24-hour fishing channels?" said one subscriber to the G. Gordon Liddy 
newsgroup. "You and I might stop to laugh for a second or two, and then move on 
to other stations.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Liddy group is like that fishing channel. I just stop by to laugh, wonder 
about the people who post and scratch my head. But other people will stick 
around to learn everything they can about Liddy." 
</P>
<P>
 To a certain degree, newsgroups do function as fan clubs. Traditional fan 
clubs are organized and managed by agents, film studios and record companies. 
Yet most newsgroups are established by the fans themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pick up on everything, from album release dates to recent deaths to film 
deals," said Michael N. Hidalgo, 18, a freshman at New York University's Tisch 
School of the Arts. "I heard about dates for the last Guns N' Roses tour, 
Stephen King's book-signing schedule for 'Insomnia' and the title of the new 
R.E.M. album before it was out." 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers can exchange memorabilia and track down rare footage of their 
favorite stars. A recent 15-minute scroll through Usenet uncovered such trivia 
as where to find a board game based on the pop band Duran Duran and what 
asteroid was named after Frank Zappa (answer: Zappafrank). 
</P>
<P>
 "If (this medium) was just a bunch of fan clubs, all you'd be reading is 'I 
love you, can I have an autographed picture, can I come see the show, I hope 
you can come to my town, I love it when you wear jeans,' " said late-night 
television host Conan O'Brien, who follows on-line postings about his show via 
alt.fan.conan-obrien . "With these groups, it's not just 'I love you' or 'I 
hate you.' You get a middle-ground buzz that you don't get through the mail, 
like debates over why one skit worked and another didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "And (posting to a newsgroup) is so much easier than sitting down and writing 
a letter. If you're into computers, you're already there." 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers say that compared to the clientele attracted to a typical fan 
club, newsgroups offer a highbrow alternative. Most of the people who read and 
post to the celebrity groups are not drooling, screaming pre-pubescents, said a 
subscriber who goes by the handle "dougr" and declined to give his real name. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there is so much that you can never learn from just listening to his 
music. It's only since I began alt.fan.frank-zappa that I've learned Suzy 
Creamcheese was a real person; the name Phydeaux was the name of Frank's tour 
bus; that Frank was deeply involved in post-revolutionary Czechoslovakia. It's 
a treasure hunt out there. Newsgroups mark where the treasure's buried." 
</P>
<P>
 Newsgroups allow fans to chat about their favorite performers on a global 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, I posted a message on rec.arts.startrek.current about 'Star 
Trek' Christmas carols," said a user named "Burkert," who peruses 30 groups 
each day. "I got a response from someone in England (named) Rob, asking me to 
update him on the show. I did, and we've become the best of friends. And I have 
yet to hear his voice or meet him in person." 
</P>
<P>
 Such anonymity plays a large part in the medium's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can be myself without any pretenses," said Christine Faltz, 25, a recent 
law school graduate in Brooklyn who subscribes to 50 lists. "It's easy to avoid 
issues you don't want to discuss, easy to pick and choose the people you think 
you might like to know. And it allows you to be frank, to disagree with someone 
without the risk of a face-to-face rejection." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes newsgroup participants elicit their own on-line following. In 
August, Faltz began posting a series of notes on alt.sex.fetish.startrek that 
depict graphic sexual scenarios between the characters of the TV show "Star 
Trek: The Next Generation." Faltz's postings -- titled "Oh Captain, My 
Captain!" -- take advantage of the uncensored atmosphere of the Internet and 
detail the characters engaging in hetero- and homosexual couplings, group 
situations, light bondage and, in one case, a rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicists for several of the "Star Trek" actors said their clients were aware 
of "Oh Captain, My Captain!" but cast members declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic erotica project, now on its 21st installment, is more than 250 
pages long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten an enormous response from people thanking me for making the 
characters realistic and writing a story that had an actual plot, as well as 
adding a sexual dimension to the characters," Faltz said. "I've even received 
requests for certain liaisons between and among different characters." 
</P>
<P>
 W hile anonymity allows sub scribers a certain degree of creative freedom, it 
also can mask a celebrity's identity. After R.E.M.'s Stipe began exploring AOL, 
on-line readers spent several days debating whether "stipey" was legitimate or 
an impostor. 
</P>
<P>
 Stipe wrote an e-mail message on Aug. 1 to singer Love: "(A)ll they really 
wanted to know was why I hate apostrophes and what are the complete lyrics to 
the upcoming (yes it is titled monster) lp. most of them wanted proof it was 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Other celebrities have started to explore this electronic frontier. Author Tom 
Clancy uses his AOL account to chat with the public. Similarly, members of the 
band Sonic Youth all have on-line access, thanks to AOL. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of heavy-metal group Megadeth gab with fans through their own 
World Wide Web site. The Web, a collection of thousands of multimedia 
databases, is the fastest-growing service on the Internet. Unlike newsgroups, a 
Web site combines text with visuals, video snippets and sound clips. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Dave Ellefson and singer Dave Mustaine cruise through the on-line 
mythical town "Megadeth, Ariz. . . . The Last Rest-Stop for Miles" nearly every 
day to chat in the Megadiner, tune into the local radio station K DETH 101, 
roll into the Digital Drive-In, check out their Horror Scope or add to 
Ellefson's electronic tour diary, dubbed the Obituary. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line cruisers can access Megadeth, Ariz., at http://bazaar.com/ (the 
temporary site, which opened two months ago, will be pulled from the Internet 
on Dec. 31). 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, no one believed that Megaman was really Dave Mustaine," said 
Charles Como, 30, a Hollywood-based computer programmer who established the 
fictional Arizona town for the band's label, Capitol Records. "They'd start 
asking him all these questions, like who did the solo for this or where was 
something recorded. They knew more about Megadeth than he did. Finally some kid 
asked 'What kind of car do you drive?' and he said, '300 SL, silver.' There was 
this pause, then everyone went nuts. You could actually feel the adrenaline 
rushing through these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Performers sometimes try to hide their identity while on-line. Courtney Love, 
lead singer of Hole and widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, spent last 
summer logging on to both Usenet and AOL using either the handle CMLC (her 
initials) or BRRRKNSTOK. Yet she often signed her e-mail with her real name. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Love's postings, which were scattered throughout cyberspace, railed 
against her biological father, whom she condemned for going on "Geraldo" to 
discuss Cobain even though he had never met the singer. She also talked about 
herself -- "my bad review in spin (magazine), I DESERVED IT, I'm not 
complaining I was a mess and we sucked" -- and would-be authors eager to pen an 
unauthorized Nirvana biography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got caught up in it," Love said about her on-line activity in a recent 
interview with Rolling Stone magazine. "It was the void that you talk to. And 
since I didn't speak to anybody else, I had to get in trouble some way." 
</P>
<P>
 A few entertainment industry figures are permanent fixtures on Usenet. J. 
Michael Straczynski, the creator-writer-executive producer of the TV series 
"Babylon 5," initially hooked up in 1984. Now, he has accounts on seven on-line 
services, including GEnie and CompuServe, and he reads about 500 newsgroup 
postings a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "My task as a writer is to create my universe as completely as possible," said 
Straczynski, 40, who spends at least two hours on-line each day. "You need to 
keep asking new questions about the characters and their universe. When I see 
500 messages a day, there are bound to be things I've never even thought 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Straczynski thinks newsgroups empower the audience: 
</P>
<P>
 "How many people in Iowa have access to speak to a television producer? Zip. 
But now they have this access, and it makes them a part of the process. It lets 
them understand how television is made." 
</P>
<P>
 B ut how many people in Iowa can chat with Straczynski? Access to cyberspace 
is limited. The poor and uneducated are not represented. And since the bulk of 
the Usenet fan newsgroup postings are written in English, the system also 
excludes those who only read another language. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Usenet is populated by the technological and cognitive elite. 
Those plugging in fall into one of three categories: computer professionals, 
undergraduate college students or anyone else who is educated enough to 
understand the software and financially solvent enough to buy the hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a true cross section of American society," said Chris Carter, 
creator and executive director for Fox's hit television show "The X-Files." 
Carter logs on a private news-reader system once a week to scroll through 
folders dedicated to his show. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know what to do at the keyboard," said Carter, 38. "Not everyone 
can do that. Even our two stars (actor David Duchovny and actress Gillian 
Anderson) are computer-illiterate. They survey the mail occasionally, but 
that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Only rarely does the public connect directly to the stars. Most celebrities, 
like Stipe and Love, are curious tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Conan O'Brien, rely on their staff to read through both fan mail 
and the on-line postings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's flattering, but there's a real danger of getting caught up in reading 
that stuff," he said. "It takes forever to get through it all, and for my show 
there's the problem that you might tune everyone else out. Like 'OK, this 
sketch is for the guy in Baltimore who e-mailed me, this skit is for him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Notes occasionally do amuse O'Brien and his staff. At one point, subscribers 
engaged in a debate over the underlying meaning behind Tomorry the Ostrich. 
This recurring "Late Night" character -- an 8-foot-tall bird -- is used to 
announce guests scheduled to appear in upcoming shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were reading all this stuff into the bird," O'Brien said. "They were 
saying, 'Maybe Conan's saying those guests are going to lay an egg' or 'I think 
the bird is Conan's representation of NBC and the hidden anger he has toward 
NBC.' But we were just trying to be funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, an ostrich is just an ostrich." 
</P>
<P>
 While the technology may be intriguing, Hollywood insiders like Carter of 
"X-Files" see Usenet newsgroups as nothing more than an electronic fad: 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of what is written reads like a party line, with people yakking back 
and forth about minor things. Maybe I'm being shortsighted, but I don't see the 
Internet revolutionizing Hollywood. It's great for marketing purposes, and a 
great way for fans to meet and occasionally stumble into a celebrity.

<P>
 They look as if they have just dashed in from a faculty reception: she in her 
nice wool suit and pearls, he in a sport coat and tie. They are busy and smart, 
pressed for time, of course -- Steve Martin and Nora Ephron would hardly be 
otherwise -- but they are also hungry and they fill the room with a restless, 
heat-seeking energy. 
</P>
<P>
 They are here to promote their movie, "Mixed Nuts," which opens Wednesday and 
is based on a relatively unknown French comedy, "Le Pere Noel est une Ordure" 
(Santa Claus Is Garbage). He is the star; she is the director and co-writer 
(with her sister, Delia Ephron). But they are each famous in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a philosophy student at Cal State Long Beach who pioneered a brand of 
droll, cerebral stand-up comedy and became one of the most popular and gifted 
comedic stars. He is also a writer, of such successful movies as "Roxanne" and 
"L.A. Story," as well as this year's bomb "A Simple Twist of Fate." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has sworn off screenwriting in favor of writing for the theater. His 
first play, "Picasso at the Lapine Agile," a comic meditation on the nature of 
genius and celebrity, has been produced in Chicago and now Los Angeles, at the 
Westwood Playhouse through March 26, to encouraging reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 She, however, was born into a family of screenwriters. After working as a 
successful New York journalist for several years, she wrote "Silkwood," 
"Heartburn" (which was based on her own best-selling roman a clef) and "When 
Harry Met Sally . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 She directed her first film, "This Is Your Life," in 1992. Her second film, 
last summer's sleeper hit "Sleepless in Seattle," made more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of them now leads a comfortable, even privileged, life: he with his 
famous art collection, she with her vast Upper West Side apartment in New York 
and a summer house in the Hamptons. He is newly divorced; she is happily on 
marriage No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, in fact, frank enthusiasts for the haute bourgeois life who know 
exactly what they want, which, at this moment, means getting their assistants 
to supply something more than the avocado-and-bean-sprout sandwiches awaiting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nora Ephron: We heard a rumor about fajitas. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Martin: Yeah, we heard she was sleeping with. . . . No, is there meat in 
fajitas? We'll take anything in the fajita world, but I'm high on the 
vegetarian part of it.  
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: We were hoping when Steve's marriage (to British actress Victoria 
Tennant) broke up he would go back to meat -- I felt it was time for him to 
break out of that -- but he didn't. I still think you're missing a lot.  
</P>
<P>
 Martin: Like a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Speaking of breaking out, Nora, were you somewhat intimidated to try 
another comedy after the huge success of "Sleepless in Seattle"? 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: I didn't want to make "Sleepless" again and this is completely 
different. It has very low ambitions, as in low comedy. I just wanted people to 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: Mike Nichols once told me that I always aimed high in something low. I 
loved that.  
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: We also hoped, by the way, that this would be on television forever at 
Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The movie is a loose adaptation of the French film, but did you always have 
Steve in mind to play the head of the suicide hot line? 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: No, because that way lies heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: All right, I'm leaving.  
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: But we did put him at the top of our little list . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Martin: The only other person they considered for my role was Winona Ryder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: . . . because there is just enough physical comedy in this that there 
weren't that many actors who could do it and also Steve can act in a way that 
isn't quite real. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you want that quality -- because this was intended to be more 
farcical than "Sleepless," almost a screwball comedy? 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: No, because it was just . . . Why did I want what? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Steve's talent for making unreal behavior seem plausible. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Because the situation of the movie is just that it couldn't quite 
happen. People behave in this about 10% crazier than in real life. Like that 
startled-deer thing that Steve does in this, the constant shock (he registers) 
when the phone rings in a suicide hot line center. That kills me. And then, of 
course, the dance sequence where Steve is leaping over tables and he's 
completely believable but it has no basis in reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: And that's what I do best actually. I'm sitting here thinking about 
myself and that's really it: Although I can play regular guys, I can also turn 
up the flame a bit, so behavior that would look crazy in real life you actually 
can get away with in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is that why the movie, which is ostensibly a Christmas story, is set in Los 
Angeles, to heighten the farcical aspect? 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Somehow Christmas in Los Angeles immediately sets the movie off 
kilter. There is something about L.A., you just understand why certain people 
come here . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Martin: And don't you think . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: . . . from all spectrums of the rainbow . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Martin: . . . don't you think that if you set it in New York that our mixed 
nuts would have been more dangerous? 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Oh, yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: This is lighter, happier, because people can exist that way in L.A. 
and not be serial killers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is it about Christmas that is so fascinating that you put it in all 
your movies? Do you actually celebrate the holiday? 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Of course I do! What kind of a question is that? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Well, many people don't observe the birth of Christ . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Well, I know that, but I've always had a big Christmas thing. It is so 
totally interesting, so endlessly interesting to me. It is such a complicated 
holiday. Unlike Thanksgiving where you could eat in a Chinese restaurant and 
say, "Isn't this great?," Christmas seems to contain every other Christmas in 
it. So when you say, "This was the best Christmas," you're really saying it is 
so much better than the year the marriage broke up, or the year when Mother 
died. It is so full of tears under all the celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: Like that line in the movie where Rita (Wilson) says, "I just wish I 
had someone to care for and who would care for me." That is such a touching 
moment, gosh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you have a weakness for the holidays, too, Steve? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: Well, I really like Christmas now, but when I was doing stand-up and 
traveling for something like 10 years, Christmas was always spent in a hotel 
room and you didn't participate in it because you would just get too sad. But 
now I've started to understand that it can actually be fun to have people 
around, fun to buy somebody a present and to get one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, both of you -- despite formidable reputations to the contrary -- are 
closet sentimentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Everyone is. I once wrote that there is no one so romantic as a cynic. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: It's also what the medium of film is really good at. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Well, it has to be an earned emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: Yes, the worst thing you can feel in a movie is manipulated and the 
best thing is to catch the audience by surprise. And it can be the smallest 
thing. One time I was driving down the street and a fire engine went by and all 
the cars pulled over. It warmed my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Why? Because civilization was working in some way? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: No, because they were doing it for someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does gender come into play in any of this? Do women write -- or direct -- 
films differently than men? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: There is a female point of view in this movie, yes, but there is 
nothing in my character that could not have been written by a man. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: I think that definitely happens when women make movies, they get to 
say different things. One of the things about this movie that I loved was that 
line about the woman who said she spent the holidays standing in the "10 items 
or less" line at the checkout register which never happened to me, but which 
feels completely autobiographical. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I thought the most autobiographical line in the movie was, "Things do not 
come to those who wait" . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Well, yes. Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: . . . because like many women directors, you've had to fight your way into 
the profession. What is it you want to say in film that you couldn't say as a 
journalist or a screenwriter? 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: I hope to make eight or nine movies before I'm done and so we'll find 
out one day. But so far I think (Delia and I) have managed to get our voice in 
there some way so they don't feel generic. I also have a very clear goal, which 
is probably foolish to even say, but I love having a group of people that I get 
to work with, so you have this little company and every 18 months or so you all 
spend three months together and eat in restaurants in cities where you don't 
live. But mostly I want to make funny movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is Nora funny? 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Delia is actually funnier . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: Yes, definitely. She's not doing shtick but . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: All you can say is, "Does this make me laugh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: . . . she has an instinct for framing the scene -- which is something 
I have. She knows the value of a joke in a scene: Is it a big or small joke, is 
it in the foreground or background, is it a big scene or a transitional scene?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about your nascent career as a playwright? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: I think movies can be great, but movies are also like a circus, even 
the making of them is such an effort -- three months to shoot it and all the 
prep and post-production. Even a bad movie is hard to make and believe me, I 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So playwriting is more of a purely mental exercise? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: When I sit down to do a screenplay, I already know too much. I'm 
mentally editing it, this scene is too long, too something. But in a play you 
can just stop for like 10 minutes and have some dialogue about an inner tube or 
something that doesn't mean anything, but if it's interesting you can just talk 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about screenwriting? You've said you won't write another movie, only 
plays. Are you frustrated by Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: I know I said that and I probably meant it . . . but I do think one of 
the biggest mistakes Hollywood makes in looking at a script is that inevitable 
question: "Will people like this character?" But they equate likability with 
someone never doing anything unlikable, it becomes Mr. Bland, almost like a 
hostile guy when it's really the foibles that make him good and human. I like 
it when a character is selfish or has a flaw that makes him more real than if 
he is Mr. Nice Guy. Even in something like "Father of the Bride," the sequel to 
which I happen to be doing now so it's on my mind, he comes off as Mr. Perfect, 
but he's actually self-centered and selfish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you disappointed about the reaction to "A Simple Twist of Fate," your 
updating of "Silas Marner," which is about a very imperfect man? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: I think I made a lot of mistakes in the writing and I was also a 
little bit distracted (by my personal life), but the reviews were so 
consistently bad I thought they must be right. I kept reading the phrase, "Not 
quite an embarrassment." Like, OK, I'll put that one on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you two collaborate as writers, or as director and actor? 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: In the context of this movie or life itself? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: We talk about the script (of "Mixed Nuts"), but I talk to her as an 
actor, because when you're acting in a movie it's very liberating to just come 
in and act and maybe think of a joke occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: And I've read some of Steve's scripts and sometimes I'll say, "Make 
this a bit more something." I've done a certain amount of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: That's what people do for each other in a certain community. If you're 
writing a script or a play and Nora Ephron and Mike Nichols are your friends, 
you ask them to read it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As creators of comic films, do you feel there is a bias against comedy in 
Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: I saw a review of "The Mask" and it had this line, "In this movie, Jim 
Carrey proves he can act." Now that is a very subtle example of how comedy is 
not considered acting. I mean, what did he do in "Ace Ventura"?  
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: What you're talking about is partly critics but mostly awards and it 
will always be No. 700 on the list of the world's problems . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Martin: Because we get such rewards for being funny. We get paid so well and 
because people love it when you make them laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: But all movies are hard to make. I read this interview with Jan de 
Bont (director of "Speed") who said, "It's harder to make 'Speed' than 
'Sleepless in Seattle.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: Uh-oh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: Well, I didn't think that was entirely random and I thought, "Why are 
you knocking my movie? I can't make 'Speed' and guess what? You can't make 
'Sleepless.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: Well, maybe he meant, "Which is harder: shooting a bunch of fun, happy 
actors or a bus?" Where would you rather go to work every day? 
</P>
<P>
 Ephron: I know, and I think I'd rather slit my throat than shoot a person's 
hand on a gearshift. That is when I will happily go back to journalism, so I 
understand what he meant -- but that's not all he meant.

NOW, FOR A LITTLE HEDONISM; FROM HIS HOLOCAUST SAGA IN WHICH JEWISH MICE ARE

 When he was 15 years old, Art Spiegelman and a friend who also aspired to be a 
professional cartoonist decided to submit some of their drawings to the New 
Yorker. The two knew that the New Yorker was the top of the line in the realm 
of their ambition, and yet, as best they could tell, the cartoons in the 
magazine were so sophisticated they didn't make particular sense. "So we 
thought the idea was to draw a cartoon you couldn't get," Spiegelman recalls, 
"and we came up with all these non sequiturs." 
</P>
<P>
 None of their submissions was accepted, but 30 years later, as things worked 
out, Spiegelman has become one of the New Yorker's most sensational artists, in 
recent years drawing illustrations for covers that are meant not just to be 
plainly understood but also to reach up and tattoo your eyeballs with images 
once unimaginable in the magazine of old moneyed taste. 
</P>
<P>
 This plot-worthy reversal has transpired under the reign of Tina Brown, the 
much-discussed British editor in chief whose noisy overhaul of the New Yorker 
has been every bit as graphic as it has been literary. In case you hadn't 
noticed or are one of the New Yorker traditionalists who refuse to pick up the 
magazine these days, it now contains comic strips by Spiegelman, Edward Sorel 
and other artists who once toiled mainly in the pages of the nation's 
"underground" and alternative media. The truth is, they are -- many of them, 
anyway -- comic strips of a high order. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Spiegelman, they are drawn by someone whose remarkable books 
"Maus I: A Survivors Tale" and "Maus II" -- which trace his parents' harrowing 
experiences in the Holocaust concentration camps and for which he won a 
Pulitzer Prize in 1992 -- have probably done as much as anything to raise the 
general esteem of comics as art. 
</P>
<P>
 As emissary for the new New Yorker, illustrator of a just-published new book 
and lecturer on the history of comics, Spiegelman had reason to be in Los 
Angeles recently, and on the morning of the day he was to be the guest of honor 
at a party at Dennis Hopper's house, he could be found near the pool on the 
roof of the Bel Age Hotel on Sunset, where he was staying. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman was born in Stockholm in 1948 and raised in Brooklyn. He lived off 
and on in San Francisco from 1967 to 1975, "shuffling back and forth (to New 
York) during the psychedelic moment," he said, but he has never spent much time 
in Los Angeles. On this day, he was not dressed for swimming; in fact, he was 
not dressed for Los Angeles at all. He was wearing a heavy herringbone tweed 
jacket over a heavy black shirt and was without sunglasses. Under the bare 
shade of a table awning, he was talking about the New Yorker; the new book, 
"'The Wild Party"; the absence of a personal style in his work; "Maus, the 
Movie" ( not! ), and then finally "Schindler's List," which he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, there was an earlier incarnation of the New Yorker which is hard to 
remember because it became such a suburban, Connecticut, Gentile magazine," 
Spiegelman said. "But in its Ross days," he said, referring to founding editor 
Harold Ross, "it was a kind of live wire -- like Peter Arno's cartoons were 
pretty hot for their moment. Charles Addams was considered rather morbid. It 
wasn't all those cartoons about businessmen in suits talking to each other over 
martinis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman said that if anyone looked at a history of New Yorker covers, from 
the 1920s through the '80s, he would see how graphic design in this century has 
plummeted: 
</P>
<P>
 "The '20s covers were quite decorative and pretty; the '30s and '40s and even 
into the '50s the covers are great -- great, great pictures. They're not just 
well-constructed images, they're arresting, they have content to them. Then, 
it's a long, slow decline from the '50s through the '80s, where it's some of 
these less-is-more wispy lined images on a flowerpot on a windowsill, which 
smacks of good breeding and good taste but to my eyes isn't even a very 
exciting picture. At least graphically, I think Tina Brown's magazine has been 
a total clarion call." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown invited Spiegelman into the magazine not long after she succeeded Robert 
Gottlieb as editor in 1992. Spiegelman shortly made his presence felt with the 
now-famous political Valentine's Day cover, depicting a Hasidic Jewish man 
kissing a black woman -- a play on racial tensions in Brooklyn, particularly in 
the wake of the Crown Heights riots. The illustration upset members from both 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe I was just really lucky that Tina was from England and didn't 
understand the hornet's nest that was being stirred up with this thing 
exactly," the artist said. "She found it as benign as she ought to." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman himself was quite pleased with the public reaction: "It was a 
controversial image, and it was meant to be. It got people talking about stuff. 
I was very happy to see that printed images can still function that way. For 
the most part, the printed word and the still visual image have been sidelined 
in our culture. Where else is a magazine cover allowed to be not a photograph 
of a celebrity or at best an illustration that's in service to the words inside 
the magazine as opposed to a free-standing thought by an artist? 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't in any given issue of the New 
Yorker, but the fact that the New Yorker is out there taking chances makes it a 
very alive and lively place." 
</P>
<P>
 Many are the skeptics who at this juncture in the conversation would say that 
given Brown's otherwise conventional absorption with celebrities as reading and 
gazing matter, it can be only a matter of time before a Richard Avedon 
photograph of Jack Nicholson or Sharon Stone becomes the magazine's first photo 
cover in 70-whatever years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Spiegelman is likely at least to have something to say about it, 
since he is not only a contributing editor but is married to the magazine's art 
editor, Francoise Mouly. The two founded the "graphix" magazine Raw in the 
early '80s, which featured work of such artists as Drew Friedman, Gary Panter 
and Sue Coe, some of whom are now New Yorker contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "So a lot of my talking about and consulting on the New Yorker very naturally 
happens with Francoise as well as with Tina," Spiegelman said. "We talk about 
artists and features and topics that would be good and visual formats that 
would be exciting to try." 
</P>
<P>
 They thought up the idea, for example, of sending "Zippy the Pinhead" 
cartoonist Bill Griffith to Aspen to cover the winter vacation scene. For the 
recent fashion issue, Coe did a strip about sweatshops in the Manhattan garment 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Francoise and I both think the best visual magazine in the history of the 
Western World was a French cartoon magazine called A Plate of Butter, published 
from 1901 to 1918 or so," Spiegelman said. "It was an amazing magazine. It 
couldn't exist in the world after television, of course. But what it was, was 
artists, sometimes very substantial artists, were allowed to do whatever they 
wanted for 16 pages or 32 pages, to give visual reports from whatever political 
vantage point the artist was coming from. So from week to week the magazine 
would lurch from left to right, and the main thing that kept it together was 
really great graphics." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman argues that since computers have altered the journalistic integrity 
of photographs ("You take a photo of us sitting here and send it to the photo 
shop and we could be sitting on the moon after you've matted us into another 
background"), photographs are "just another graphic style" with no authority 
except a vestigial one. Which he believes is only good news for graphic 
artists, making room for them to work and compete as journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as prose can be written in the first person and be journalistic, I'd say 
that it's possible now for artists to be working in the first person and still 
be giving journalistic information that has the same authority. Ultimately it 
might have even greater authority because you know where it's coming from. That 
kind of thing is part of what's possible at the New Yorker now." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a coincidence "but a happy one," Spiegelman said, that the 1928 
narrative poem "The Wild Party" -- which he has chosen to illustrate and 
republish (Pantheon Books) -- was written by Joseph Moncure March, who was once 
managing editor of the New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman first came upon "The Wild Party" in a used bookstore in the 
underground comix year of 1971, when the notion that he would one day be on 
staff at the New Yorker and have won a Pulitzer Prize would have been the 
week's best hookah dream. In any case, he said the poem's energetic, 
"hard-boiled" sensibility grabbed him and didn't let go. Considered slightly 
pornographic at the time, "The Wild Party" is an alternately playful and 
cynical tour in rhymed couplets of a New York showgirl's tawdry romantic life 
and a party that ends in a murder. William Burroughs is said to have been 
influenced by it.

 "What hips, what shoulders, what a back she had! Her legs were built to drive 
men mad." Spiegelman recited from the poem, gripped anew by its spell and 
wanting to share it. He picked up the slender volume, beautifully designed (by 
him), and searched for another set of lines he wanted to read. He found them: 
"Some love is fire, some love is rust, but the fiercest, cleanest love is 
lust." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great stuff. It's a book that if you fall for it at all, it goes way 
deep. It's just an expression of that Lost Generation between the wars, of that 
kind of unsentimental world view that's now become our basic set of glasses, 
from MTV to 'Pulp Fiction' to 'Sesame Street.' That attitude is the late 20th 
Century's attitude, and this is the birth of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the scores of heavy black-and-white drawings he has done to illustrate the 
story of these lowlife vaudevillians, Spiegelman takes both a gently humorous 
and frankly sensual approach, matching the style of the piece itself. Where 
"Maus" was drawn with a rather schematic line, these figures have the look of 
old engravings or woodcuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insofar as I have a style," he said, "it's by default. What I try to do is 
use a surface that's appropriate for the occasion. The point isn't to subsume 
the project as an expression of my sensibility but to enter into the project as 
fully as possible and find out what sensibility comes out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was not at all sure that people could identify his New Yorker 
covers from their markings alone: "I think some people say, 'Oh, it's got real 
wise-guy content, it must be Spiegelman.' But I don't think they can tell from 
the way it first looks." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the one of children exiting a school bus and heading all toward 
their morning classrooms, armed with automatic weapons. Spiegelman? Yeah. But 
the cover that might have been a dead giveaway was one from last Christmas 
season that never ran. Spiegelman drew a guy dressed up like Santa Claus 
urinating against a wall, with the stain forming the shape of a Christmas tree. 
Behind the man was a poster that said, "Don't forget the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 The night before the morning he was sitting on the roof of the Bel Age 
reciting "The Wild Party," Spiegelman had delivered a lecture about "Comics as 
a Means of Self-Expression" at the Los Angeles Central Library downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the auditorium where he gave his talk, a posted notice read: "Please 
be advised Art Spiegelman will be smoking during the program and book signing." 
He made good on the threat and told his sold-out audience that the two "Maus" 
books, which took 13 years to complete, had been delayed a year and a half by 
his attempt to quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman also told those who came to the library, among other things, that 
"comics are time made visible as space," that comics are "the Yiddish of art," 
that comics can "sear their way into your brain," that he has no use for 
super-heroes in comics ("They smell of fascism to me") and that as the culture 
moves into a "post-literate moment," comics are rising in importance. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran through the basic events of his own coming of age as a cartoonist, 
crediting the anarchic Mad magazine for overturning the sanitized Disney World 
that comics had become during the 1950s. "I thought of Mad magazine as an 
addition to the Talmud," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist said that he does not favor painterly comics, preferring a 
"scratchboard style" that carries readers quickly through the story rather than 
slow them down to marvel at the virtuosity of the drawing. That would describe 
the style of "Maus," in which he made the decision to represent his parents and 
other Jews as mice and the Nazis as cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "So why did I use mice? It had something to do with Zyklon B," he said, 
referring to the pesticide used by the Nazis to gas the Jews at Auschwitz. 
"With the idea of exterminating vermin." 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Maus" was published in 1986, Spiegelman has been offered heaps of money 
by studios and producers who want to turn the story into a movie. He has 
steadfastly refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I don't like movies, or 'Movies, that's not literature' -- like 
comics is! It's not that at all. It has more to do with the fact that 'Maus' 
took 13 years to find a specific form, with a lot of false steps, to hit a 
correct emotional tone. And I don't think that can be done by any committee. 
There are just too many ways for this thing to become sentimental, let's say, 
or on the other hand too vulgar, depending on the way one missteps." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the closest he has come to taking a deal was suggesting to one 
producer that he might agree to sell the rights "if they will use real mice." 
He has not heard back on that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone at the library asked about "Schindler's List," last year's Oscar 
winner directed by Steven Spielberg, a film Spiegelman has criticized in the 
past. He replied that he "had some problems with it" and let it go at that. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the hotel talking to a reporter, he grew more expansive as his opinion 
of the movie seemed to connect with other things he was saying about aesthetic 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want to enter into a kind of sweepstakes competition over who 
gets to win in control of genocide," Spiegelman said. "Hands down, Hollywood 
wins every time. It's the dominant narrative mode of our culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are problems with the film. For one thing, it tries to have it both 
ways. It's a specific story based on something that happened. At the same time, 
it's trying to become the definitive statement of the Holocaust -- a film used 
in schools to teach what happened to our children. You can't have it both ways. 
If it's going to be the second, then this is the wrong story to tell, because 
you're talking about an anomaly. You're talking about a righteous Gentile of 
some kind. This makes people feel good, but this wasn't what the story was 
about. The story was about the collapse of civilization, not about its heroic 
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one kind of problem. There's also a problem with dramatic 
representation that comes with this territory. What does it mean to elicit 
dramatic pleasure -- and tears and tragedy can offer dramatic pleasure as well 
as comedy, and uplift and music -- from so much suffering? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a scene in the movie where they think there's going to be gas coming 
out of the showers and it turns out to be just water. That's played for every 
ounce of emotional manipulation that can be had. There's a very similar 
sequence in 'Maus,' because when my father was brought to Auschwitz to a place 
where he was going to go in the shower, and he had heard about the showers, it 
turned out to be a live shower. . . . It's two panels in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I think that 'Maus' achieves its effects with no emotional manipulation, 
and that was very important to me. Like, all the cards are on the table, and if 
you cry it's just because life is sad. The problem with 'Schindler's List' 
ultimately is that it falls back into being a movie. So it has messages that 
have more to do with movie messages than actuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was important to me in 'Maus' not to try to make the characters heroic, 
not to try to make Vladek heroic," he said, referring to the character based on 
his father. "To cast doubt every time a statement was made, to try to preserve 
the complexity, because it's in that complexity where something can be 
understood." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Spiegelman said some thing that tends to get your attention coming from 
a cartoonist. He said, "I ask that you not caricature my position on 
'Schindler's List.' Because I really don't want to go one on one with Steven 
Spielberg about this or become a spokesperson again. I think 'Maus' is its own 
response to the events that happened and can function for those who dig further 
for more information than what 'Schindler's List' is offering." 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, asked if he were going to draw anything about Los Angeles, he 
replied quizzically: "About my trip here? Not unless I do one strip I've been 
thinking about that has to do with being a smoker on a book tour. Even last 
night, the contortions that had to be arranged for this thing to happen at all, 
with a very hip fire marshal who was able to find a loophole." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman discovered that, when it wants to be, L.A. is still a can-do town.*

THE STUDIO SHUFFLE; THE TOP JOBS IN HOLLYWOOD PRACTICALLY COME WITH AN 
EXPIRATION DATE. WHAT'S LIFE LIKE AFTER LEAVING THAT POWER, MONEY AND STATUS ON 
THE LOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Hollywood's executive suites are designed with a revolving door. A studio 
head, on average, has a three-year life span on the job, and sometimes only 
half that time. Since 1991, six of the eight major studios -- all but Warner 
Bros. and Universal Pictures -- have suffered major shake ups in their top 
managerial ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the industry has seen back-to-back departures by two of its 
highest-profile players: Sony's Peter Guber and Disney's Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
Earlier this year, TriStar's movie head Mike Medavoy stepped down to join 
ex-studio luminaries such as Ned Tanen, Frank Price, Dawn Steel and Alan Ladd 
Jr. in independent production. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who've been on top say the highly coveted studio chief post is like none 
other, extreme in its ups and downs. Price, who formerly headed both Universal 
and Columbia, compares the job to being president of a small country. More like 
being in a straitjacket, says Disney's Joe Roth -- at least when he was at 20th 
Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of a company plane, automatic deference and mega-ego stroking, and the 
power to greenlight pictures, are seductive -- but they come at a price. The 
downside includes seven-day weeks, round-the-clock meetings and relentless 
media scrutiny to which Paramount's Sherry Lansing has yet to adjust. United 
Artists chief John Calley cut out from Warner Bros. at the peak of his career 
because his sole identity was "studio chief." Frank Mancuso remembered the 
almost palpable tension that preceeded his departure from Paramount. Steel 
missed the creativity -- and, initially, her own celebrity -- after she left 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what happens to the call sheet, the table at Morton's, and that 
all-too-fragile sense of self when one relinquishes the reins, which is more by 
force than by choice? Seven movie executives, all of whom have gone from "in" 
to "out" -- and, in some cases, back to "in" again -- reveal what it's like to 
be part of that rarefied circle of studio chiefs -- and to leave that power 
behind.

THE STUDIO SHUFFLE; JOHN CALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Then: Vice chairman of Warner Bros., 1974-1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Now: President of United Artists since Sept. 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If John Calley had been asked 14 months ago if it was conceivable he would 
ever take another studio job, he would have said, "Are you nuts?" 
</P>
<P>
 Here was a guy who did what very few Hollywood executives at the top ever do: 
He voluntarily walked away from a plum job, lots of power and big, big bucks to 
. . . go find himself ? 
</P>
<P>
 Calley, 64 -- who a year ago September became the president of the moribund 
United Artists after a 13-year hiatus from Hollywood -- had been a top 
executive at Warner Bros. for more than 11 years. In 1980, having just signed a 
new seven-year deal reportedly valued at $21 million, the studio vice chairman 
decided that he wanted out. He was 50, and, as he puts it, "didn't know if 
there was anyone home." His friends and colleagues thought he was "a 
psychopath" for quitting a job he could do with his eyes closed. Not to mention 
the perks he would miss: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to get a driver's license, you call the head of security at the 
studio, a guy comes in from the Department of Motor Vehicles and says, 'Thank 
you, Mr. Calley, for letting me kiss your ass, and here's your driver's license 
-- and can I have an autographed picture of Clint Eastwood?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his Santa Monica office at UA nursing a horrible bout of flu, 
Calley said, "I felt in some wacky way that I had lost myself, that I had no 
sense of myself and that I was being described to myself by my phone list and 
the invitations which I never responded to. I wasn't dreaming my dreams 
anymore. I hadn't had an authentic impulse about what I wanted do with myself 
for some years." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after he resigned and was about to go live alone on Fishers Island, 
N.Y., he attended a party for one of the executives who was going to run 
Warners' production department. While there, a young actress approached him. 
"Are you John Calley?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard myself say, and not as a wisecrack, 'I was .' The guy you want is 
over there,' " he told her, pointing to his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Calley says he finally realized "I wasn't enjoying it . . . I knew who I was 
in the movie business, but I had no idea who I was anywhere else." He would 
start each day with an early morning meeting and often not leave work until 
midnight, "when I'd come home and not have any time to do anything but take a 
tray up to bed and read screenplays." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a typical day for Calley at UA is no different: "I'm usually up by 6 and 
on the telephone or reading. I come in anywhere between 8:45 and 10:30 and go 
home and read. My day ends when I fall asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 So why go back? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was becoming dead," he says. "I was growing increasingly paralytic in my 
approach to life. I was doing a lot of recreational sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
 While he admits being obsessive again, this time, he says, "it intrigues me to 
look at me behaving the way I'm behaving -- I come to it as a different 
person." Calley says that for the first time in his 30-year career, "I'm 
enjoying it enormously. It's gratifying to see it up and running and fun to 
confirm that perhaps (his success) wasn't an accident the first time." CLAUDIA

THE STUDIO SHUFFLE; MIKE MEDAVOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Then: Chairman of TriStar Pictures, 1990-1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Now: In process of launching entertainment company with two partners and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He no longer wields power as one of Hollywood's handful of movie studio 
moguls. But don't tell Mike Medavoy he's any less a player today than he was 
for the two decades when he was a top executive at United Artists, Orion 
Pictures or, most recently, TriStar Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may not have the stripes, but I have something to show for the last 20 
years," says Medavoy, 52, who is now taking meetings and fielding phone calls 
from the library of his sprawling Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Medavoy did not leave with a lucrative production deal commonly offered to 
former studio heads, so for the past several months, he and two partners -- 
former Carolco Pictures President Peter Hoffman and former head of 
Columbia/TriStar International Arnie Messer -- have been talking to investors 
about financing their own entertainment venture. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent afternoon, the driveway of Medavoy's villa off Coldwater Canyon is 
lined with cars. The door is answered by one of Medavoy's personal assistants; 
several people are busily milling about. 
</P>
<P>
 Medavoy gives a quick tour of the downstairs quarters. A living-room mantel 
holds several Golden Globe trophies and Academy Award plaques for movies in 
which he's been involved, including "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 
"Amadeus," "Dances With Wolves" and "Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Plopping on a sofa in front of photos of himself with several U.S. Presidents, 
Medavoy reads from a list of projects he left behind at TriStar that are now 
coming to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were all my movies," he says, sounding rather melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
 Letting go seems hard for Medavoy, who went through a painful time both 
professionally and personally when he left TriStar in January after clashing 
with then-Sony Pictures chief Peter Guber. "I had a tough year with leaving 
there and my marriage failing," he says, referring to his breakup with Patricia 
Duff Medavoy. "I went through a series of betraying moments." 
</P>
<P>
 As for leaving TriStar, Medavoy says, "I have no bitterness toward senior 
management. . . . I'm not depressed about it. I know it's part and parcel of 
doing the job."  
</P>
<P>
 Medavoy, who has been in the business for nearly 30 years and was once a 
high-powered agent for clients such as Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford 
Coppola, says, "I'm not devoid of friends or work. . . . there's a lot going on 
in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Medavoy acknowledges that though he never allowed himself to be totally 
consumed by the job, "I think I may have lost some perspective on myself and 
the people around me. . . . I probably let some things happen to me without 
reacting and confronting people. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do give up something. . . .Maybe you do disconnect on some personal level 
with your wife. Or maybe you disconnect with people you're close to." 
</P>
<P>
 He said someone once criticized him for not seeming vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing you can do in this town is appear vulnerable, because then 
they go for your throat," he says. CLAUDIA ELLER

FILM CLIPS / COUTURE ON CAMERA: WHEN SHOW BIZ TAKES ON FASHION BIZ, ONE SIZE 
FITS ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Frank DeCaro, Frank DeCaro writes about fashion for New York Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "You ever been to a fashion show? It's a sort of pagan ritual, a ceremonial 
dance where the faithful sit around sipping tea and worshiping clothes. There's 
a sacrifice involved, too. $1,500 for a dress, so help me. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Gregory Peck, as a sportswriter married to a fashion designer in the 1957 
film "Designing Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the lights came up after a screening a few weeks ago of Robert Altman's 
latest film, "Ready to Wear," a journalist in the third row turned to the 
fashion editor sitting next to him and said, "Those clothes weren't real, were 
they?" He was referring to the tartan kilts and figure-distorting bustles that, 
in the film, are the provocative designs of Cort Romney (Richard E. Grant). 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, sure they are," the editor chirped. "That's all Vivienne Westwood." 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter couldn't believe his ears any more than he believed his eyes. 
What looked to him like fantasy costumes never intended to be worn were 
actually the clothes that those who attend the twice-yearly ready-to-wear 
collections in Paris, Milan and London -- "the faithful," as Gregory Peck 
called them in "Designing Woman" -- stand up and cheer about. What seemed to 
this guy to be visual jokes are the styles that fuel fashion, the uncompromised 
visions of one of the world's most respected designers. 
</P>
<P>
 This man, like Peck's character, must be forgiven. He is not a fashion person. 
He is not a member of what has been called "the cult of the initiated." But 
that makes him a lot more typical an audience for Altman's new film, which 
opens Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences who are not acquainted first hand with the world of high fashion are 
not likely to believe their eyes, either, as actors like Lauren Bacall and 
Tracey Ullman rub elbows with such real-life designers as Christian Lacroix, 
Gianfranco Ferre and Jean-Paul Gaultier. What's real (editors finding their 
hotel rooms full of flowers and gifts upon check-in) and what's fake are all 
mixed up for this big-screen fashion farce. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's usually what happens when it comes to putting the fashion industry 
on film. It is a case of one business of artifice trying to capture another 
business of artifice -- cosmetically concealed warts and all. Throughout the 
years, when Hollywood turns its cameras on the fashion industry, the pictures 
that emerge are glamorous to be sure. Like the fashion show sequence filmed in 
color and plugged into the black-and-white world of George Cukor's 1939 version 
of "The Women," fashion injects pizazz into a film. But film isn't always so 
kind to fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fashion business adores the movies unconditionally -- designers 
repeatedly find inspiration in the glamorous days of Hollywood's golden age -- 
it is often a one-sided love affair. The portrait the film world paints of the 
fashion business is usually not an altogether pretty one. 
</P>
<P>
 Models are beautiful but stupid. Designers are coddled, capricious creatures. 
Fashion editors are flighty fascists. Everyone in the business is superficial, 
self-obsessed and convinced that what they're doing is of Earth-shattering 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has been shown is that they're basically shallow and that they have no 
inner lives," says designer Isaac Mizrahi, who is the subject of a new fashion 
documentary called "Unzipped" by director Douglas Keeve. "Fashion is always 
treated like the naughty stepchild." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mahogany," for instance, the 1975 film about a would-be fashion designer 
(Diana Ross) who becomes a top model, "really said a lot of scary things about 
fashion," says Mizrahi. He isn't referring to the Kabuki-style costumes Ross 
designed for the film, either. In "Mahogany," like so many fashion films, the 
fashion players are emotionally bankrupt. As Ross' politically correct 
boyfriend (Billy Dee Williams) says, "Baby, I don't understand this whole trip 
. . . making clothes for rich people to look at in a magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 20 years later, "Ready to Wear" is not nearly as unsettling, biting its 
broad target, but with rubber teeth. Although Altman acknowledges that fashion 
often is portrayed as frivolous and superficial, he is surprised by how worried 
some members of the fashion press were before seeing the picture. "What is it I 
could say that would be so terrible?" he asks. Making a big deal about nothing 
is part and parcel of fashion on film and on television. On the British comedy 
series "Absolutely Fabulous," level-headed daughter Saffron (Julia Sawalha) 
says to her panic-attack-prone mother, Edina, the fashion publicist: "It's only 
a fashion show . . . all you've got to do is play a bit of music, turn on the 
lights, get some people who've thrown up everything they've ever eaten and send 
them down a catwalk. . . . " But to Edina (Jennifer Saunders), like the 
characters in "Ready to Wear" and other fashion features, fashion is life or 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Films fuel the notion that fashion is something foisted on the public, 
ridiculously expensive confections shoved down women's throats. In "Funny 
Face," Kay Thompson's deliciously dictatorial fashion editor Maggie Prescott 
says "I want the whole country pink!" and launches into a giant "Think Pink!" 
production number that pronounces there's "not the slightest excuse for plum or 
puce . . . or chartreuse." Two minutes later, when asked if she'll be wearing 
pink, she says "Me? I wouldn't be caught dead." In other words, it's a power 
play between fashion people and "real" people. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion people are cultured and refined, gorgeous, effortlessly thin but 
cadaverously cold. "Face it, we're a cold lot, artificial and totally lacking 
in sentiment," Thompson says in "Funny Face," when she learns that her 
photographer (Fred Astaire) has fallen for his new model (Audrey Hepburn). Love 
for anything but clothes or work is not acceptable.  
</P>
<P>
 Real people, on the other hand, are often rubes with hearts of gold who never 
quite feel comfortable in the rarefied air of the fashion world in which they 
inadvertently find themselves. In "The Fashion Show" episode of "I Love Lucy," 
for instance, Lucy and Ethel go dress shopping in a couture salon. More 
accustomed to Gimbel's basement, Ethel asks, "Where are the racks? What do you 
paw through?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even dressed in such finery as the Don Loper original Lucy covets so 
fervently, they would likely not be welcome in the clique. Fashion's 
exclusionary nature is always reinforced on film, offering a glimpse of glamour 
but never with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if I put on my new suit maybe I could join the club. I couldn't. I 
didn't speak the language," says unpolished sportswriter Gregory Peck in 
"Designing Woman." Used to a crowd of poker-playing he-men, he's put off by his 
new wife's (Lauren Bacall, who is also in "Ready to Wear") circle of friends. 
"It's a silly, ridiculous business," Bacall says. "It pays far too much money. 
You meet silly, ridiculous people . . . and I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the ridiculousness, though, the fashion world is a safe haven for the 
eccentric. The world of "Ready to Wear" -- chock full of bisexual designers, 
heterosexual transvestites and pregnant nude models -- is "a comfortable home 
for people who've been ostracized," Altman says. That has always been true of 
fashion in real life and in fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the funniest examples of this is the "Lily Munster, Girl Model" episode 
of "The Munsters." In it, a ghoulish Lily (Yvonne DeCarlo) shows up to a model 
"go-see" wearing her usual costume -- a dress spun of "black widow's web." 
Instead of frightening designer Lazlo Brastoff (Roger C. Carmel), Lily enchants 
him with her exotic beauty. "Tell the other girls to go home," Brastoff says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a film or a television program does not have to be about the fashion 
business to be a "fashion" show. Truly, "The Wizard of Oz" was all about a pair 
of shoes. "101 Dalmatians" was about a fur coat. Designer Isaac Mizrahi says 
that films like "Auntie Mame" with Rosalind Russell "say more about fashion 
than fashion-industry movies often do. They say more about what people look 
like at that moment." Certainly, this is true of "American Gigolo," which 
helped boost Giorgio Armani's cachet in America in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion practically becomes a character in some films. Jean-Paul Gaultier 
designed the clothes for Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and 
Her Lover," including a dress that changes color as the wife goes from room to 
room, and for Pedro Almodovar's "Kika," where the hostess of an exploitation TV 
news show wears a video camera in her hat and a light-up bra to illuminate her 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the strongest things to happen to fashion was Nolan Miller's 
'Dynasty.' Every woman around started looking like Joan Collins," adds Michaele 
Vollbracht, an artist and former fashion designer who played himself on a 
fashion episode of the 1980s series "Hart to Hart." 
</P>
<P>
 Vollbracht has not seen "Ready to Wear" yet -- Vollbracht lives in a small 
town in Florida now -- but he is disappointed when he hears that the fashion 
industry is not savaged by the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it had just annihilated it," Vollbracht says with a charmingly 
embittered flair. "But I don't think they could ever really get the treachery 
of Seventh Avenue on film. I don't know if the entertainment industry knows how 
lethal the fashion industry is. There's nothing stranger than the real life in 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 He's lived in the world of ready to wear. He knows.*E. GEORGES

FILM CLIPS / EXERCISE OPTION: FOR ARSENIO HALL, HIS SONY TV-FILM DEAL IS 
PARAMOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Natale 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, whatever happened to Arsenio Hall's much-anticipated Hollywood career? 
</P>
<P>
 He was last seen guest-starring on "Living Single" last season, while his 
late-night talk show was still on the air. But otherwise he's been keeping an 
uncharacteristically low profile. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be about to change. Recently he quietly severed his longtime ties 
with Paramount Pictures. According to a studio spokesman, Hall's television 
deal with the studio expired Oct. 15; his movie agreement with Paramount runs 
out in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Like several other ex-Paramount nabobs such as former studio chairman Stanley 
Jaffe and studio president Ned Tanen, Hall's company Arsenio Hall 
Communications has resurfaced at Sony Pictures Entertainment, and last month he 
signed a first-look deal with Sony for television and film, says his attorney, 
Larry Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Swann, Hall's senior vice president and producing partner, says that 
Arsenio fielded other offers but had been predisposed to Sony from the casual 
relationship he'd developed with Sony Pictures Chairman Mark Canton whom he saw 
frequently at L.A. Laker games. "Arsenio had never had an agent," says Swann. 
"And when he signed with Richard Lovett and Mike Ovitz at CAA six months ago, 
he told them Sony was where he wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he hunkers down on his new deal, Hall's parting shot for Paramount is 
as executive producer on an exercise video, "The Flo-Jo Workout: Mind, Body and 
Spirit," starring Olympian Florence Griffith Joyner. Swann says she's hoping 
for the same success that Hall had on the last Paramount video, the NAACP Image 
Award-winning "Time Out," a 1992 AIDS education title featuring Magic Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
 "Black women don't have a role model (for exercise)," says Swann of the Joyner 
video. "Flo's Olympic status could inspire a whole new generation of women who 
don't currently take care of themselves." The video is due in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sony deal calls for Hall to star in and serve as producer on upcoming 
projects. The top priority at the moment is feature films, in particular a 
comedy tentatively titled "Senior Year" which will be produced by Tanen. Sony 
is currently searching for a writer for the project, about which Swann will 
only say, "It's not a teen comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, 37, made his film debut in John Landis' "Coming to America" (1988) and 
was also in 1989's "Harlem Nights." His syndicated talk show ran from 1989 to 
early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For television, Hall plans to develop sitcom material for some of the young 
comics who appeared on his show, including Darrell Heath and Alex Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they've only been in their new home at Sony for a few weeks after such 
a long stretch at Paramount, Swann says that she and Hall have acclimated very 
quickly. "We're feeling very safe now."*

FILM CLIPS / MAGNUM OPUS: WINERY HAS A SEXY DISCLOSURE TO MAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert W. Welkos 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most memorable appearances in "Disclosure" is made not by stars 
Michael Douglas or Demi Moore, or even the spectacular office set. Rather, it 
is of Jason Pahlmeyer's wine, presented in the film as an extremely rare 
vintage, which ends up playing an important role in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Pahlmeyer, a 49-year-old former attorney who owns a tiny vineyard in the Napa 
Valley, produces only two kinds of wine -- one red, one white -- but his 
Chardonnay is about to become one of the most highly touted wines in the world, 
compliments of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 A bottle of 1991 Pahlmeyer Chardonnay, of which only 400 cases were produced, 
is highly praised in the film, and it plays a pivotal role in the 
sexual-harassment case around which the film's plot revolves. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of publicity corporate wineries would gladly give big money to a 
studio to get. 
</P>
<P>
 In Crichton's novel, there is no mention of a specific brand of wine shared by 
the lead characters, Tom Sanders (Douglas in the film) and Meredith Johnson 
(Moore). Instead, a key plot point involves Johnson's assistant buying a box of 
condoms along with the wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Screenwriter Paul Attanasio said that he and director Barry Levinson decided 
against making condoms pivotal to the film. Still, Attanasio said, he needed 
something "that could put a chink in Meredith's armor." 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed a piece to turn the tables on her," he said. "I remembered reading 
about the '91 Pahlmeyer Chardonnay and how it was a great Chardonnay but that 
they only made 400 cases of it. I tried to get it and I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for some upscale restaurants, Pahlmeyer ships mainly to select wine 
shops, and then only a few cases at a time. Retail cost is about $24 a bottle.  
</P>
<P>
 Attanasio said that Demi Moore somehow managed to find a magnum of '91 
Pahlmeyer Chardonnay and gave it to Levinson. "That shows you how resourceful 
she is," the screenwriter said. "Barry is hoarding his magnum. He's not sharing 
it with the rest of the cast." 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Oakland, Pahlmeyer was a trial attorney with the U.S. 
General Services Administration and later had a private practice. In 1975 he 
bought a 55-acre plot in Napa Valley and decided to start his own vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call my Chardonnay 'industrial-strength Chardonnay,' " Pahlmeyer said. "I 
want it big, rich, buttery and powerful. It should be drunk all by itself." 
</P>
<P>
 And what if the demand for his wine goes up because of the movie? 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to see an increase in production," Pahlmeyer said. "I can't 
and I won't increase it -- I don't want to spoil a good thing."*

THE STUDIO SHUFFLE; FRANK PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Then: Chairman of motion picture division, Columbia Pictures, 1979-1984; 
chairman of MCA Motion Picture group, 1984-1987; chairman of Columbia Pictures, 
1990-1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Now: Chairman of Price Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming a studio chief was the realization of a dream for Frank Price, whose 
boyhood was spent on the Warner Bros. lot where his mother worked in the 
commissary. Photographs of Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, Olivia de Havilland 
and James Cagney -- inscribed "To Frankie" -- still decorate his walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that I had Harry Cohn's job was a real kick," says Price, 64, of the 
legendary Columbia Pictures mogul. "Though there was certainly some 
ego-stroking, the best part of the job was the ability to buy the best -- 
directors, scripts, talent. The worst was spending your day saying 'no' -- 
telling people you don't share their dreams. You're making subjective decisions 
in a very amorphous realm . . . and have to wait 18 to 24 months before you 
know if you guessed right." 
</P>
<P>
 After presiding over Universal's TV division, which turned out 15 movies of 
the week plus 15 to 19 hours of programming each year, Price found the feature 
film world relatively manageable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like playing poker," he says. "When you like a job, they have to pry you 
away from the table -- even if you don't win every hand," he says. "Whenever I 
felt overly stressed, I reminded myself that it's easier than writing. It's 
'let's put on a show' . . . and getting paid to do it. Unwilling to base my 
decisions on other people's perceptions, I spent a lot of my time reading. From 
what I understand, however, that's the exception rather than the rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Price calls studio chief one of the world's great jobs. "I'd like to know what 
the drawbacks are," he says. "Anyone who complains about the stresses is a 
fool. The pay and the perks are good. You have fun lunches with Streisand and 
Redford. And it's sort of like being head of a small country. Though I rarely 
used the plane, I was met at the airport and commanded a certain amount of 
deference. Things go your way -- period." 
</P>
<P>
 Price had 14 months of relative leisure between his 1987 departure from 
Universal and his production deal with Columbia/TriStar. During that time, he 
listened to Mozart and devoured books ranging from "Das Kapital" to Adam 
Smith's "The Wealth of Nations." That was a luxury, he realized then. But his 
heart was with the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always better to have power than not," Price says. "Still, once you 
occupy that office, you take some of that leverage and credibility with you. 
You can't say 'yes' to $25-million pictures but, in some way, you're still 'Mr. 
President.' Being a studio chief is a calling card and we all work with labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look upon that experience as gathering research for my novel -- my version 
of 'The Last Tycoon.' " Price concludes. "I know that world better than F. 
Scott Fitzgerald. This is a business like no other. Though there may not be any 
more politics and infighting in Hollywood than elsewhere, the stakes are so 
much higher. One bad casting decision can ruin a picture." ELAINE DUTKA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Then: President of production, 20th Century Fox, 1980-1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Now: After 11 years as an independent producer, was named chairman of 
Paramount's Motion Picture Group November, 1992. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 After spending seven of the first 18 months of her marriage to director 
William Friedkin away on location, Lansing gave up producing for a studio chief 
post. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, she says, the position gave her more 
control over her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the only person who took this job so I could be home for dinner," 
Lansing, 50, says. "I hardly ever travel. My stepson Jack does his homework in 
the alcove outside my office. Except for previews, I rarely go out at night. 
When I took the job, I told (former Paramount Communications President) Stanley 
Jaffe and (former Paramount Communications CEO) Marty Davis that if they were 
looking for someone who hangs out at Morton's, they had the wrong person." 
Still, it's no walk in the country, Lansing hastens to add. "I'm lucky if I 
take off two weeks a year," she says. "I get about 100 calls a day which I try 
to return within 24 hours. Far easier to deal with the lack of flexibility and 
spontaneity that comes with the turf if your personal life is in place. If I 
was still single, I would never have taken this on." 
</P>
<P>
 For someone who loves making movies, Lansing says, being studio chief means 
being able to say yes to projects she believes in. It's a vast improvement over 
her producer days when she saw "Fatal Attraction" and "The Accused" turned down 
twice by every studio -- and over those days as Fox production chief when 
advertising and distribution weren't part of her turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fox had the chance to pick up domestic rights to the (Oscar-winning) 
'Chariots of Fire' for $1 million but the head of marketing said no," Lansing 
recalls. "And they hated Martin Scorsese's 'King of Comedy' so it was released 
in only four cities. I felt impotent, setting movies in motion and seeing them 
destroyed. Those two movies pushed me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Overseeing between 18 and 25 films a year, Lansing says, is a huge 
responsibility. "As a producer, you have a beginning, a middle, and an end," 
she notes. "You finish a movie, you fly off to France for a month. Now I'm 
planning two years ahead. You never get to go 'whew!' or savor a 'Forrest Gump' 
since you're always worrying about next summer or next Christmas.  
</P>
<P>
 "But it forces you to move on from the disappointments, as well. This time out 
is much easier than at Fox when I was 35, a kid without any moviemaking 
experience. I have a much better sense of what's possible now because I've been 
there. I still think of myself as a producer -- and of Paramount as one huge 
production office." 
</P>
<P>
 As a former actress, Lansing might be expected to have greater tolerance for 
the spotlight. Not true, she insists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media scrutiny is the most painful part," Lansing says. "There are so 
many truths and untruths to which you can't respond, people you don't know 
saying things about you. When it hurts a lot, you build a wall and tell 
yourself that's the price you pay. The buck stops here, which is both good and 
bad since the hits and flops both come under your watch. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' was one of my favorites and, to this day, I 
don't know why it wasn't nominated or do a lot of business. You love your ugly 
children as much as the pretty ones, so it kills you." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, says Lansing, such attention is misplaced. "It's not about me, 
but the talent," Lansing notes. "If you had a chance to have lunch with me or 
an Academy Award-winning director, who would you choose? The parking place and 
the table at Morton's . . . that all goes away. Your legacy, in the end, is the 
movies you help to make." ELAINE DUTKA

THE STUDIO SHUFFLE; JOE ROTH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Then: Chairman of 20th Century Fox, 1989-1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Now: After heading up his own Caravan Pictures, was appointed chairman of Walt 
Disney Motion Pictures Group, September, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before accepting the job of chairman of Fox, Roth had never received a weekly 
paycheck. For a maverick producer with a deep distrust of the system, the job 
was a turning point in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of me felt like I was in a straitjacket," Roth, 46, recalls. "I was more 
reactive than active. Half of each week was spent in preordained meetings. My 
time wasn't my own. When I accepted the job, I figured I could do it on my 
terms -- which turned out to be half true. Though the job doesn't have to 
define you, a lot of people depend on you to get pictures made, so it's very 
hard to draw lines. It was much, much, much more of an adjustment than I 
deluded myself into thinking it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a flip side, though. Having a desk job, however consuming, gave him 
stability and stronger family ties -- at least in his mind. (" I thought I had 
a life . . . my wife disagreed.") It also fostered a sense of community he'd 
been missing in his life as a producer. "For the first time, I felt like the 
leader of a team," he recalls. "I made new friends which, in your 40s, are very 
hard to come by." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of "Home Alone," "Sleeping With the Enemy" and "Die Hard 2" 
propelled Fox's market share from No. 6 to No. 1 for 40 weeks, however, and 
complications set in. "People treated me with such elevated respect that I 
ended up trusting no one," Roth admits. "Surrounded by 'yes' people, I found it 
difficult to take counsel. And I didn't allow myself to enjoy the good times, 
which I was naive enough to think would never end. I have tremendous regret 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Life after Fox, Roth says, required little adjustment. Putting together 12 
Caravan movies in 18 months kept him busy. Agents, excited at the prospect of 
another buyer in town, kept his call sheet full. And since he says he has 
always gone to "maybe one party a year," there was no visible change on the 
social front. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, something somehow had changed. "Making movies lost some of its magic," 
he says. "Memories of locations proved to be better than the reality. To my 
surprise, I missed a lot of what comes with being studio chief -- the broader 
palette, the strategic planning, the challenge, the power." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing his studio chief cap feels different this time. Roth is operating less 
defensively, trying to live in the moment. "If 'The Santa Clause' takes off, 
I'll go through the roof," he said before the release of Disney's smash film. 
"If the movie falls short, I'd crash a bit. I tease (former Disney studio 
chief) Jeffrey Katzenberg and (MCA motion picture chairman) Tom Pollock about 
protecting themselves so well from the swings in the business that they've lost 
the highs and the lows. If you can shrug off success and failure so easily, 
it's hard to be passionate enough to make movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking on this job is a lot like having kids," Roth concludes. "It's all 
about extremes. The investment is huge but the payoff is there. Unfortunately, 
the corporate aspect gives things an edge." Elaine Dutka

<P>
 Now: Chairman of MGM/UA, July 1993.

</P>
<P>
 One morning in the spring of 1991, before he left for work, Frank Mancuso 
received a shocking phone call at home from his New York-based boss Martin 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he found himself being forced out as chairman of Paramount 
Pictures, the studio where he had cut his industry teeth and worked for some 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 For the two previous weeks, he now says, there had been "a lot of tension 
between me and Davis." While he had been aware that Davis was looking to bring 
in a president and chief operating officer at the studio's parent company, 
Paramount Communications, Mancuso says, "I wasn't aware that I would have to 
report to him." 
</P>
<P>
 During the fateful phone conversation, in which Davis told Mancuso that 
producer Stanley Jaffe, who had a deal at Paramount with Sherry Lansing, had 
been hired for the job, Davis tried to persuade Mancuso that the management 
restructuring would be "terrific." Davis even went so far as to get on a plane 
that afternoon and fly to Los Angeles "to tell me how good it was going to be." 
 
</P>
<P>
 But Mancuso saw the handwriting on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chose to believe that (Jaffe's hiring) would change my role and I didn't 
want to participate," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Mancuso's contract precluded his reporting to anyone but Davis. Soon 
after, Mancuso resigned and filed a $40-million breach of contract suit against 
Paramount, and won a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The most painful part of the experience, he says, was "being denied something 
you love to do -- it hurts." Yet he says he knew that he worked in "a 
revolving-door industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Mancuso, now 61, says, "I realized I had lived the American dream," having 
gone from being an usher in a movie theater to being the head of one of 
Hollywood's major studios. "I decided to take that experience away rather than 
those last two weeks."

 In a recent interview at his spacious executive suite at MGM/UA headquarters 
in Santa Monica, Mancuso says, "The greatest benefit of leaving Paramount was 
the opportunity to fulfill on a personal basis all of the things I never had 
the time to do while I was chairman, because the job is completely consuming." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested to his wife of 37 years, Faye, that finally they could travel and 
spend time with their family. And they did -- but nine months later, he started 
feeling antsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pace of my life changed so dramatically, from having no time to do 
anything to having all the time to do anything. I got totally bored."  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, after an aborted effort to produce a film for his friend Jack 
Nicholson, he was approached by Mike Ovitz on behalf of Credit Lyonnais, which 
owned the beleaguered MGM, about coming in to resuscitate the studio and 
restart its dormant UA arm, which hadn't released a film since 1990's "Rocky 
V." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing what running a studio is like the second time around, Mancuso says 
he encounters "a lot fewer surprises today" and finds the time pressures "are 
less of a burden . . . you have a better sense of how to divide your time." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest revelation for him in returning to the studio ranks is 
that "traveling, playing golf and playing tennis, was not relaxation to me. 
This, work, is relaxation." CLAUDIA ELLER

SPILLING THE BEANS ON DAD; LYNN REDGRAVE'S SOLO SHOW TACKLES HER FAMOUS 
FATHER'S LEGACY -- THOUGH SHE'S LEFT SOME SECRETS OUT. 
</P>

 Three years ago, when Lynn Red grave was out of work -- "not even being 
offered jobs I didn't want to do," she says -- she was invited to do a 
Shakespeare reading at the Folger Library in Washington. She decided to combine 
that with "the little play" she'd been ruminating on about her father. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest child of actors Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, Redgrave 
grew up in a household dominated by her brilliant, larger-than-life father, who 
apparently poured his energy and passion into his work -- leaving little for 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The play she created, "Shakespeare for My Father," is a bittersweet memoir of 
their relationship, balancing family history and anecdotes with short readings 
from Shakespeare -- because, she says, "my memory of him was in Shakespeare 
roles." Buoyed by a strong response, she took to the road in 1993 with an 
expanded version of the piece, playing 27 cities in six weeks, starting with 
three stops in Sothern California. The tour was followed by a nine-month run -- 
and a Tony nomination -- in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 After a sold-out stint at the UK/LA Festival at UCLA earlier this fall, 
Redgrave has returned for a four-week run at the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills 
through Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Redgrave was born in England in 1943. She was invited by Laurence Olivier to 
become a founding member of Britain's National Theatre in 1963. American 
audiences got to know her in 1966 as the vulnerable heroine in her 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar-nominated turn in "Georgy Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Among dozens of TV, theater and film credits, she has performed locally 
onstage in "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" (1988) at the Ahmanson and "Don Juan in 
Hell" (1991) at the Henry Fonda. She co-starred with sister Vanessa in "The 
Three Sisters" in London (1990) and in the 1991 TV remake of "What Ever 
Happened to Baby Jane?" 
</P>
<P>
 She has been married for 27 years to actor-director John Clark (who is 
producing and directing the solo show); the couple have two grown children, 
Benjamin and Kelly, and live in Topanga with their 13-year-old daughter, 
Annabel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Many of the reminiscences in the piece are personal and painful. Did 
it take a lot of strength to share them with an audience? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think it's courageous for any of us to get up there every night, to 
go out on your own and say, "Watch me" -- even though we love it. And the 
longer one does it, the standards are higher; you always fear failure. I have 
to fight back fear every time: "Maybe tonight I'll blow it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the piece itself doesn't feel brave. I hope it makes people think how 
important we are to each other: parent to child, child to parent. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm doing what I should do -- taking my life and work and making good of it -- 
and also giving hope to other actors. There's very much a sense in the acting 
profession of passing down the torch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about personal privacy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've been dramatically selective; I draw the line. The fact is that I'm 
open and everything is true -- but I haven't told you everything. I still have 
my secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you ever question whether the piece would work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, yes. When I started, I really had no idea what I had. Some days I'd sit 
with my head in my hands in despair: "Why should this pitiful story be of any 
interest? Why share it?" Other days, I'd be elated. After the first night, a 
lot of people came up and said, "You showed me me and my father." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After 400 performances, can you still tap into genuine emotion when you 
tell these stories? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think I could have performed the piece six months after my father's 
death (in 1985); the proximity would have been overwhelming. Now -- this is 
hard to describe -- it's performance, and it's real. As a performer, I must 
tell the audience this story, tell it as if for the first time. I have to get 
lost -- but I can't get so lost that I can't go on. It's terribly real to me 
when I do it. I dread when it won't be. On those nights, I always remember what 
my husband says: "Never tell a lie. Say it and mean it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After writing this, were you at a place of peace with your father? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I thought so; now I realize I had a little way to go. Each time I do it, I 
bring a little more (peace) to it. Now it's with a sense of, "Thank you, Dad, 
for a great job." The privilege, the pain and all the rest -- I wouldn't change 
a moment.*

THE PANACHE IS BACK; PAUL SALAMUNOVICH HAS RESTORED THE L.A. MASTER CHORALE'S 
TO ITS FORMER GLORY; NOW, THERE'S THE AUDIENCE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Paul Salamunovich remem bers, way back when, better times. Born in Los 
Angeles, the 67-year-old music director of the Los Angeles Master Chorale has 
been an integral part of a rich period of music history in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Names, places and performances pop up in his conversation in tones of 
disbelief -- was I really a part of that? Performing in Monday Evening Concerts 
with Stravinsky; at the Hollywood Bowl in Mozart's Requiem with Bruno Walter; 
for Roger Wagner, Alfred Wallenstein, Eduard van Beinum. Recording with Stan 
Kenton on Capitol Records, with Robert Kraft in the complete works of Webern. 
Preparing choruses for the likes of Solti, Ormandy, Steinberg and Mehta. More 
than 80 appearances, as singer and choral conductor, on movie soundtracks; 
recording "It's a Small World" for Disney; pop singing on offbeat record 
labels. "The old days," he calls them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salamunovich's feet are firmly on the ground this afternoon during an 
interview in his North Hollywood home. These recollections may well be there to 
keep his spirits up, because he has practical concerns on his mind. He looks 
tired. His schedule sounds hectic. The phone keeps ringing. He talks in a 
bleary, husky, near-whisper of dwindling audiences and finances for the Master 
Chorale, the lack of music education in our schools, dealing with the 
musicians' union and diminishing rehearsal time. 
</P>
<P>
 Salamunovich is not complaining, exactly, but obstacles are obstacles, and 
anything that gets in the way of his passion for choral music and his mission 
of bringing it to listeners, is just, well, a pain in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Things could be worse, though. Since taking over the leadership of the Master 
Chorale in 1991 -- "like the prodigal son come back" is what he called it at 
the time -- after what many consider the less-than-stellar regime of John 
Currie from 1986-91, Salamunovich has been praised not only for his programming 
and elegant musicianship, but for restoring the choir to what it was under 
Roger Wagner, the group's founder and its music director until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The return to the old sound isn't exactly a surprise. Salamunovich grew up 
under Wagner's wing, first as a singer at 13, then, after service in World War 
II, in Wagner's Concert Youth Chorus in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 The chorus became the Roger Wagner Chorale in 1949 and then the Los Angeles 
Master Chorale in 1964, when it became established as the resident chorus of 
the Music Center. Salamunovich was Wagner's assistant conductor and right-hand 
man from 1953-77 -- he characterizes the relationship as one of father and son. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the Chorale, Salamunovich continued his many choral activities 
here in town, including music directorship (from 1949 to the present) of the 
St. Charles Borromeo Church Choir, which performed for the Pope at the Vatican 
in 1988 in what Salamunovich calls "the greatest moment of my life"; and his 
27-year faculty position at Loyola Marymount University, relinquished upon his 
Master Chorale appointment in 1991. Also a hyper-active clinician, he has 
participated in an estimated 696 choral festivals and clinics worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Wagner was messily forced into retirement in 1986 and Salamunovich 
was one of several leading candidates passed over in favor of the man some 
considered the more glamorous foreign candidate (Currie), Salamunovich's 
discontent (and he was not alone) spilled over in a letter to The Times. Now 
that he's in the top place, however, those feelings appear to have passed. He 
will admit only that Currie's style "was contrary to the sounds I was used to," 
but quickly adds, "I like John Currie. I visited him in Scotland this past 
August . . . he's a very erudite, good musician." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, changes have been made. "When I took over the Chorale," 
Salamunovich says, "the first thing Wagner told me was, 'Paul, get rid of half 
the sopranos and hire basses' -- to get back to the old sound." 
</P>
<P>
 He replaced Currie's bright, operatic sound with a kinder and gentler 
sonority, mellow and blended "with the energy -- or, should I say, foundation 
of the sound -- coming from the lower voices." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the choir didn't put up a fight. Inheriting a group mostly auditioned 
by Currie, Salamunovich had to do some coaxing. "I got the men to understand 
immediately in the first few rehearsals three years ago, and the altos were 
close to getting it immediately, but I had to fight the sopranos . . . I've got 
to admit to you that a lot of sopranos . . . don't like restraining their 
voices. They resent it. But they don't resent the beautiful product that comes 
from it." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no sense of tension during an evening Master Chorale rehearsal -- an 
efficient, tightly wound affair. No time to waste, lots of music to cover. Less 
than 30 seconds elapse between the end of one piece and the beginning of 
another, Salamunovich hurrying the music off his stand in the same motion as 
the cutoff and quickly grabbing the next piece on the pile. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoken directions are minimal, the conductor preferring to run through entire 
pieces, perhaps stopping for brief suggestions or to sing a phrase the way he 
wants it. He and the Chorale have developed their own argot apparently, and no 
one seems puzzled by such enigmatic commands as "hot potato," "no diphthong," 
"quicksand," and "three blind mice." 
</P>
<P>
 Salamunovich's less mysterious advice is colorful too. On how to end one 
passage: "Like someone kicked you in the gut." On how not to sing a long note: 
"In a short while there will be decay, and it will stink." He asks his sopranos 
for "a warm-mother sound please, don't wake the kid up." The choir makes rich, 
cozy sounds for this Christmas program, perfectly tuned, and turns on an extra 
shimmer in Morten Lauridsen's new "O magnum mysterium," with the ecstatic 
composer listening. A single, loud clap from Salamunovich serves to stop the 
Chorale, mid-phrase. The stopwatch he wears around his neck is emblematic of 
his hurry -- he clicks it on to time the union regulation break. 
</P>
<P>
 In its early years, Salamunovich said, "the Chorale was not as unionized . . . 
We didn't have the time element to worry about, we just rehearsed and we could 
rehearse for two or three months, maybe rehearse two different programs at one 
time. Now, when I came back, it has come to where the union has set control of 
the group and said you must have no more than 2 1/2 hours per rehearsal, and 
you will pay them, and they'll have a 20-minute break, and you have to only 
work on one program. You cannot look ahead to the next concert if you have an 
easy program this time, so you have to judiciously figure out how many 
rehearsals you can do a concert in. And each rehearsal costs almost $4,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Given such restrictions, the group has only four rehearsals for the Christmas 
program and just one to prepare Mozart's cantata "Davidde Penitente" for a Los 
Angeles Philharmonic concert. "And I want it to be virtuoso," he says, "because 
I remember what the Chorale was when I sang and how it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 If Salamunovich talks a lot about artistic hurdles, he also realizes that he's 
lucky the Chorale even exists. Last season, when the Music Center Unified Fund 
reduced its contributions to the Chorale (and other Music Center performing 
groups because of a fund-raising shortfall), Salamunovich says they "had to 
save $40,000 immediately, or go under." The orchestra was cut from the next 
concert, the Chorale forced to perform with piano accompaniment only. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences have been dwindling after his first successful season, but he's not 
sure why -- he points to the 1992 riots, the flagging economy and even poor 
musical education in schools. In an effort to attract larger audiences, 
Salamunovich has attempted some culturally diverse programs, such as the 
"Reflections of Freedom" concert two seasons ago featuring music from Eastern 
Europe, and last month's "Canciones Para Los Angeles" featuring Latin American 
music, but both drew fewer than expected. "We're trying to attract a new breed 
of people," he says, just who they are "is what we're trying to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 But deep down, Salamunovich believes that it will be the power of the art that 
wins over new audiences: "In my early years," he says, "I would never in my 
lifetime think of going to the ballet. And we were engaged many years ago -- 
35, 40 years ago in the Roger Wagner Chorale -- to appear with the Sadler's 
Wells Ballet in 'Daphnis and Chloe.' We were in the orchestra pit . . . I was 
in the last row and had one foot onstage. What a thrill for me the first time 
to be that close singing and watching Dame Margot Fonteyn. It was like, where's 
this been all my life? So, if you can get them to go to the Chorale -- it could 
be almost any program -- if they could feel the fervor and truthfulness of the 
performer, the artistic truthfulness, their involvement, that energy will come 
to them."* * Paul Salamunovich conducts the Los Angeles Master Chorale in 
Christmas music by Britten, Pinkham, Susa and others at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion. Tonight at 8. $7-$45. (213) 365-3500.

COMING TO TERMS WITH MOM; GEORGANNE DEEN'S WORK IS A NAKEDLY PERSONAL INQUIRY 
INTO HER DEMONS AND OBSESSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 'Art is how I navigate depression," says artist Georganne Deen, whose series 
of paintings exploring her relationship with her mother, "The Mother Load," is 
on view at the Christopher Grimes Gallery through Jan. 7. "Making art enables 
me to work through it, and with these paintings I neutralized things that had 
been infuriating me for years. This isn't to say I was finally able to love my 
mother when I finished the series -- I did, however, feel a sense of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know lots of people who have similar relationships with their mothers," 
adds Deen. "Maybe I gravitate toward them, but it's also possible that the 
problems these paintings examine aren't unusual." Deen's problematic 
relationship with her mother may not be unusual, but many other things about 
her are. The Los Feliz house she shares with her husband of five years, 
archeologist John Pohl, is a veritable museum of outsider and folk art, kitsch, 
funk and psychedelia. And Deen herself is a physically fragile, birdlike 
creature with the iron will of a locomotive. She speaks with a Texas drawl that 
might make you dismiss her as a hayseed if you didn't know better; in fact, 
she's been an underground art star for 15 years, and, along with Sue Williams 
and Sue Coe, is one of the few women artists to be regularly included in shows 
exploring art rooted in low culture rather than academia. Like Gary Panter, 
Robert Crumb and Art Spiegelman, Deen blurs the boundaries that separate 
cartoons, fine art painting and advertising. And as is usually the case with 
work of that ilk, her art is a nakedly personal inquiry into her own demons and 
obsessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently included in "New Pop," a show of work by 15 American artists at the 
Fortuny Museum in Venice, Italy, Deen can be seen next month at Chicago's Carl 
Hammer Gallery in an exhibition exploring cartoons that burst the bounds of 
that form. She's also at work on a segment for "Bad Day on the Midway," the 
second interactive CD-ROM by San Francisco cult band the Residents, and 
recently completed a cover for "Go Naked," an underground comic edited by Gary 
Panter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised by a single alcoholic parent and was a miserable child," says 
Deen, who was born in Ft. Worth in 1951, one of two girls in a family of four 
children. "My parents divorced when I was 6, and once my dad left my worst 
nightmares about my mother came true -- she pulled out every stop and let it 
all hang out. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was interested in art, and she made things, but her taste was very 
middle class -- she made a mosaic of a guy holding bongo drums, for instance," 
says Deen of her early influences. "We did have art books in the house though, 
and as a teen-ager I loved psychedelic art, British Pop and German 
Expressionism." 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 17, Deen was hit by the first of three serious depressions that 
were to shape her life. "I went to a therapist who put me on drugs, but that 
didn't help -- in fact, nothing seemed to help, and I didn't know how to get 
out of this state, or if I'd even live through it. I couldn't draw or do much 
of anything, and I just lay in bed, stared at the ceiling, and completely 
withdrew from the world." 
</P>
<P>
 I n 1970 Deen began to emerge from her depression, then in 1972 she had what 
she describes as "my first real art experience. That was when I met Gary Panter 
-- when I saw his work, I knew I'd seen something different." The following 
year, at Panter's encouragement, Deen enrolled at East Texas State where he was 
also a student, and began to find her own voice as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped doing what my teachers told me to do and started having fun with 
art," she recalls. "At the time I was looking at a lot of Outsider art and work 
by the Hairy Who, but one of my biggest influences then, and now, was 
advertising art -- I love pictures and words in clever combinations." 
</P>
<P>
 Deen has done advertisements, but ultimately the style she began developing at 
East Texas State matured into something with far too much edge to function as a 
sales tool. Combining elements of Surrealism with the fragmented composition 
typical of much post-modern art, her work has a hallucinatory undercurrent of 
dread evocative of Hieronymus Bosch and Francisco Goya; like those artists, 
Deen is essentially creating visual morality tales. 
</P>
<P>
 Deen's second depression hit in 1974 when her younger brother was killed in a 
motorcycle accident. "When my brother died the family went into a tailspin -- 
my mother started drinking again and I crashed for the second time. My solution 
was to move to New York. I moved there planning to be an artist, but there 
wasn't any art around that resembled what I was doing, so I wound up working as 
an illustrator. I was making a decent living, but by 1978 the depression I'd 
been fighting off since 1974 took over and I stopped being able to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "After two terrible years, I moved to L.A., in 1980," she continues. "I was 
still depressed but I wasn't in the depths of it, and artistically things began 
to improve. I stopped free-lancing and enrolled at CalArts, but the teachers 
there kept trying to mold me into something I wasn't, so I quit after one 
semester." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving CalArts, Deen started trying to get any work she could; she had a hard 
time finding work, was paid next to nothing for the work she got, and much of 
what she did was rejected by the people who hired her. Those factors conspired 
to liberate her once and for all from commercial art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally started making art just for myself, and the focus of the work 
shifted from outside issues onto what was going on inside of me," she recalls. 
"At the time, underground galleries like the Zero Zero were starting to open in 
L.A., and I showed at the Zero a lot during those years. I also started doing 
illustration work again, which I finally started to enjoy because people 
stopped asking me to do things that weren't me," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming on the heels of this shift in direction, Deen married in 1989 and moved 
to Washington for a year, where her husband was awarded a research grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were in Washington, I started descending into my third depression, 
and as always I didn't have a clue how to cope with it," she says. "The one 
thing I knew was that the sound of my mother's voice threw me into a complete 
rage, so I decided I wasn't going to have anything to do with her. I knew I had 
to do something more to resolve the feelings I had about her though, so I spent 
a lot of time thinking about exactly what she'd said and done that was creating 
such problems for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conclusions I came to probably sound really trite," she says. "For 
instance, she never told me anything about her own life, and never gave me 
anything you could consider good advice on how to deal with problems. She was 
extremely critical, and never taught me how to deal with conflict. She had 
distorted ideas about love, and told me that sex was bad and dirty. She taught 
me that to be beautiful you had to get a perm, tweeze your eyebrows -- you had 
to subject yourself to pain to be beautiful. The idea of a beauty that comes 
from within never occurred to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I realized all this, the ugly drawings I was making at the time started 
making sense to me," she continues. "I didn't like the images I was creating, 
but I kept plugging away, and eventually realized I was making art about my 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't plan it this way, but the series begins with a birth painting and 
concludes with a puberty-age painting. The last painting, 'Mary's Lane,' was 
the hardest to do because it forced me to deal with something incredibly 
painful -- the point where I turned against myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd die if (my mother) saw these paintings because she's a pretty sad case, 
and I'm not trying to do anything to her," says Deen of the eight-painting 
series, which she completed last year. "I made these paintings for me, and have 
come to think of them as instructive paintings that should hang in the home as 
a reminder to behave oneself, especially if you have children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most fully realized body of work I've done, but it's also been 
the hardest," she concludes. "I've said that the paintings enabled me to deal 
with my depression, but truthfully, I don't know how I survived it. I've been 
trying to figure that out -- in fact, I think that will be the subject of my 
next series. What prevented me from going all the way? For all I know it 
might've been my mother."*

ART NOTES: NEW TATE GALLERY SET FOR LONDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 London's venerable Tate Gallery is moving ahead with ambitious plans to 
transform Bankside Power Station, a massive brick building with cathedral 
windows on the south bank of the River Thames, into a new Tate Gallery of 
Modern Art. The 120,000-square-foot facility is slated to open in the year 
2000, more than doubling the Tate's present exhibition space. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major reorganization of its collections, the Tate plans to devote its 
existing building to British art from the 16th Century to the present. About a 
mile and a half to the northeast -- opposite St. Paul's Cathedral and the 
central district known as the City of London -- the new gallery will display 
international modern art. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest step in the Tate's expansion effort is an announcement of six 
architects chosen as finalists in an international competition to design the 
new gallery. Those selected are David Chipperfield (Britain), Herzog & de 
Meuron (Switzerland), Office for Metropolitan Architecture (Netherlands), 
Rafael Moneo (Spain), Renzo Piano Building Workshop (Italy) and Tadao Ando 
Architect & Associates (Japan). The winning architect will be announced in 
February. Tate Gallery Director Nicholas Serota, Austrian architect Hans 
Hollein and Richard Koshalek, director of Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary 
Art, are among the members of a 10-person committee that will select the 
architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankside Power Station was designed in 1947 by Mott, Hay and Anderson 
Engineers and built in two phases between 1948 and 1963. The obvious challenge 
facing the Tate architect is to convert a power station into a museum for the 
21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 But the architect is also expected to think in terms of the building's 
metropolitan context. Promoted as "one of the most important public buildings 
to be realized in Britain in the last quarter of the 20th Century," the new 
gallery and its spectacular 8.5-acre site will be a key element in London's 
development over the next two decades and in the regeneration of the London 
borough of Southwark. Plans call for constructing a bridge to link the Tate 
Gallery of Modern Art with St. Paul's Cathedral and a pier that will allow 
visitors to travel between the two Tates by river.

POP EYE: SOUNDTRACK ALBUMS GET WORDIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, the key to a hit soundtrack album was sending movie audiences home 
humming a song. Now, the idea is to send them out of the theater -- and into 
record stores -- mouthing snappy dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 People buying the new "Pulp Fiction" album are apparently drawn as much by its 
priceless patter between John Travolta and Samuel Jackson about French 
cheeseburgers as by Urge Overkill's version of "Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon." 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier in the year, radio station phones rang off the hook when deejays 
played the "Natural Born Killers" mix of "Sweet Jane" by the Cowboy Junkies, 
which features verbal exchanges between the film's stars, Woody Harrelson and 
Juliette Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other notable soundtrack albums also sport dialogue, including the one 
for "Pulp Fiction" director Quentin Tarantino's previous movie, "Reservoir 
Dogs," and the recent independent film "Clerks." And coming up in January: the 
album for John Singleton's "Higher Learning," mixing music and dialogue, 
including both a song and some lines by rapper/actor Ice Cube. 
</P>
<P>
 "People from our distribution department are coming up to me and saying, 
'There's a tremendous amount of interest in the dialogue -- can we have more?' 
" says Kathy Nelson, who as senior vice president and general manager of MCA 
Soundtracks supervised the production of both the "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir 
Dogs" albums. 
</P>
<P>
 She says that she introduced the idea at MCA with the album for "The Fisher 
King," featuring several bits of rants by Jeff Bridges as a radio talk-show 
host. Another soundtrack in this tradition was "Good Morning, Vietnam," 
featuring deejay Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have guessed that the reaction for this would be so strong," 
Nelson says. "I hoped people would enjoy it, but I never guessed it was the 
selling hook." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson says Tarantino's films are naturals for such treatment. For all the 
talk about his use of blood and violence, the director, influenced by the likes 
of Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, centers his films on dialogue that 
sticks with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 So can we expect every film soundtrack album to use dialogue? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we're getting a lot of attention, it will probably become a trend," 
says Nelson. "But think of all the films you see and imagine how boring it 
would be to listen to the dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LEARNING LESSONS: John Singleton drew on a different tradition from Tarantino 
in designing his dialogue-utilizing "Higher Learning" album. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started for me as a thing I heard on hip-hop records," the director says. 
"Often they'll put little 'scenes' between the songs. It's natural for me and 
it's nice for the movie to have an affinity with the soundtrack and the 
soundtrack to have an affinity with the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst-case scenario for Singleton would be people writing dialogue 
specifically because it would sound good on an album, just as songs are often 
commissioned to sell a movie rather than serve the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get disgusted with that," he says. "A lot of films now seem where they're 
made just for excuses to make a soundtrack album. I make films to be films, 
whether or not there's an album." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 UNCONTROLLABLE URGE: The success of Urge Overkill's "Girl, You'll Be a Woman 
Soon" single shows how you can find hits in the most unusual places. The song 
(written by Neil Diamond in the late '60s) is featured in "Pulp Fiction," but 
it wasn't recorded for Tarantino. The director found it on an EP that the 
Chicago band released two years ago on a small, independent label. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA's Kathy Nelson says that Tarantino found the EP in a London record store 
and loved the track so much that he actually constructed a key Uma Thurman-John 
Travolta scene around the song. 
</P>
<P>
 The record's success makes Diamond the latest unlikely avatar of hip -- right 
on the heels of Tony Bennett. There'd been talk about his joining Urge Overkill 
for a performance at the recent Billboard Awards show in Los Angeles, but 
Diamond was off recording an album in Nashville. 
</P>

<P>
 THE BOSS IS BACK: Bruce Springsteen, who is always working on new songs, has 
been going overtime in the studio lately and will likely have a new album in 
stores by summer. But despite overtures from wishful-thinking concert 
promoters, he's not planning to reteam with the E Street Band -- which he 
dismissed several years ago -- for a new tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters, flushed with the success of this year's blockbuster treks by the 
Eagles, Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones, say that a Springsteen/E Street tour 
would be one of the top attractions of '95. Speculation that it could happen 
heated up last fall when E Street drummer Max Weinberg -- currently the 
bandleader on "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" -- sat in with his ex-Boss for a 
performance on the MTV Video Music Awards show. 
</P>
<P>
 Says a Springsteen spokeswoman, "It's just not going to happen." 
</P>

<P>
 CALIF-PHOBIA: Can a rock band succeed without ever setting foot in California? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the question surrounding the touted Seattle quartet Sunny Day Real 
Estate. While the band did play at one of last weekend's KROQ Acoustic 
Christmas concerts, it had to do so as a trio -- guitarist Dan Hoerner simply 
will not come to the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 The band refuses to do interviews, but Nils Bernstein, spokesman for Sub Pop, 
the group's record label, says that Hoerner just doesn't like California -- he 
grew up here and apparently as a youth had some unspecified bad experiences 
with state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 That's definitely put a crimp in the band's career progress. Last fall the 
group was inundated with offers from major labels, but those have diminished 
some given Hoerner's aversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein says that the group couldn't care less: "They've already gotten a 
million times more attention than they'd ever hoped for. They won't go to 
California just to sell records, though the other members wanted to play there 
for their fans." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 LORD ALMIGHTY: As if there's not enough controversy surrounding Courtney Love 
already, a new feud could make rock headlines next year when Mary Lou Lord 
releases her debut EP on the small Olympia indie label Kill Rock Stars. Love 
has already been attacking Lord in her computer on-line missives -- and she 
even chased Lord out of the Hollywood Palladium and down Sunset Boulevard after 
Hole's concert last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The squabble is over the fact that Lord once had a brief fling with Kurt 
Cobain (before he and Love were married) and Love is charging that Lord is 
using that as a key point in her resume. Lord denies this and, says Margaret 
Mittleman, who signed Lord to a publishing deal at BMG, the Boston-bred singer 
hopes to downplay this conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Lord's EP features a song titled "That Kind of Girl," written for 
Lord by songwriter Mark Keating, that makes thinly veiled references to Love, 
including a mention of a connection with Smashing Pumpkins, whose Billy Corgan 
was once involved with Love. Steve Hochman

 SMALL FACES: Industrial-rock band Ministry has a new album due in stores in 
May, with a somewhat surprising single set for January: a version of Bob 
Dylan's "Lay Lady Lay."... 
</P>
<P>
 Skid Row will be among the bands to test the prevailing opinion that heavy 
metal is dead, with a new album being finished in Vancouver and due in stores 
in March. Sebastian Bach and crew will tour upon the release. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ex-Bangle Susanna Hoffs has a new album and a new baby in the works. She's 
just signed with London Records and has been working on songs with producer

VIDEO; CELEBS TAG FILMS AS TOP GIFT IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donald Liebenson, Donald Liebenson is a Chicago-based writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still looking for a holiday gift idea? These days video is being aggressively 
marketed as a col lectible and not just as an evening's entertainment, ranging 
from family films and classics to broad-demographic box-office hits such as 
"Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Speed." 
</P>
<P>
 An average video is affordable, one size fits all (unless you're still into 
Beta), and there's no worry about color (unless you want it in 
black-and-white). Video is also versatile, with movies and other programs to 
match every taste and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 And video affords you, the giver, an opportunity to share a viewing experience 
that touched, inspired or influenced you. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for last-minute suggestions, we asked some well-known people: "If you 
were going to give a movie on video as a gift, what would it be?" The results: 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton: A spokesperson said, "The President, history buff that he 
is, would highly recommend 'Schindler's List' for its historic and artistic 
significance." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Maltin: The "Entertainment Tonight" movie critic says, "An ideal video 
gift is an old Hollywood musical, be it 'Singin' in the Rain,' 'The Pajama 
Game,' 'Down Argentine Way' with Betty Grable or 'Calamity Jane' with Doris 
Day. There's nothing more cheering, more certain to lift a person's spirits, 
and there are few film genres that can be enjoyed so completely by every member 
of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lemmon: "The choice is very difficult, obviously, but having seen it 
again recently, I think I might pick 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' The 
entire production, the writing and the direction were of the very finest, and 
the performances were universally superb. Overall, it is without question one 
of the finest and most effective films I have ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton Heston: "Citizen Kane," "The Bridge on the River Kwai" or the 
Laurence Olivier version of "Henry V." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Grodin: "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World." 
</P>
<P>
 Homer Simpson (as told by several "Simpson" writers): "Although I remain 
skeptical that you can 'buy' a 'video' for use in your home, I recommend Ingmar 
Bergman's 'Fanny and Alexander.' It's the only Bergman film I managed to see 
only once during its commercial release." 
</P>
<P>
 Ariana Richards: "There is this little movie out there about dinosaurs that 
might be of interest," says the young actress who happened to appear in that 
movie, "Jurassic Park." "I usually like anything by Steven Spielberg. But I 
would also give 'Roman Holiday,' my favorite Audrey Hepburn movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Cybill Shepherd: "My favorite movie is 'Rules of the Game,' directed by Jean 
Renoir. I like the way it sneaks up on you. You think it is light, but it turns 
out to be very sad and profound." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Sarandon: " 'Bob Roberts,' so then you don't have to watch the news," 
says the woman who shares her life with that movie's star and creator, Tim 
Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 John Waters: The iconoclastic director says, "I'd give 'Mademoiselle,' the 
arty 1966 'shocker' written by Jean Genet and directed by Tony Richardson. A 
horny, repressed schoolteacher (Jeanne Moreau) in a remote French village 
poisons the farm animals, sets fires, crushes baby bird eggs in the nest and 
licks the boots of a woodcutter, all in the name of Gallic frustration. I guess 
I'm just a romantic at heart."*

BEWARE OF WANNA-BE@FAKE.COM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You pop on to your America Online account, check your e-mail and find a note 
from "Keanuu." The message details how he loves motorcycles, misses River 
Phoenix and enjoys playing bass in a band called Dogstar. 
</P>
<P>
 You pull up Keanuu's on-line biography -- something every AOL member fills out 
when signing up with the service -- and the name listed is KReeves. Even the 
birthday shown -- Sept. 2, 1964 -- matches the actor's. So it's got to be 
legitimate, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. Whether it's someone who poses as a celebrity or who deliberately 
spreads false rumors, fraud is rampant in cyberspace. And neither stars nor the 
public may be able to do anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line information is usually reliable, experienced computer users say. But 
those scrolling through on-line systems should learn to be wary of what they 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always a zillion rumors floating around," said a subscriber to 
several newsgroups who goes by the computer handle "SDL3966." 
</P>
<P>
 "The rumors always go in cycles. Every few months, you'll see a flurry of 
'Omigod, did you hear that one about X?' The older 'Netters will roll their 
eyes and say, 'Yes, I've heard that one 10 times. It's not true.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial services like America Online, CompuServe and the Well have released 
a host of wide-eyed novices to the electronic realm. For this new wave of 
curious explorers, technology has become an authority figure that isn't 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at a computer screen and you forget that you're actually just 
dealing with other people, not some omnipotent being," said J. Michael 
Straczynski, creator of the TV show "Babylon 5," who has been on-line since 
1984. "You're stuck in a room on the Internet with thousands of people you 
don't know. One or two of them are bound to be jerks." 
</P>
<P>
 While anonymity plays a large part in the medium's appeal -- on-line, you can 
be anyone, with any age and background -- some 'Netters enjoy fooling others by 
posing as celebrities. On Prodigy, for example, two people claim to be Trent 
Reznor, leader of the industrial-rock band Nine Inch Nails. On America Online, 
three subscribers are posing as U2 singer Bono and four as Keanu Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times sent e-mail notes to the four Reeves wanna-bes, asking, "Are you the 
Keanu Reeves, star of the film 'Speed'?" Three responded with a yes. One using 
the handle "Keanuu" wrote back that he "picked up on lotsa chicks this way." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, the real Reeves has never gone on-line. In a statement, the 
actor said he is "appalled" and will "explore any and all legal action" to halt 
this misrepresentation. But it's a gray area. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the person is being malicious and the celebrity feels like his or her 
image is being damaged, then you might have a case," said Lance Rose, a 
Montclair, N.J., lawyer who specializes in high-tech and information law. "You 
could argue that it's a defamation of sorts, that it's defamation in front of a 
huge audience that's growing each day." 
</P>
<P>
 But most lawyers say Reeves could be a plaintiff without a cause. For a 
celebrity to pursue a civil lawsuit, the impostor must use the 
misrepresentation to trick others out of money or something else of value. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone shows up on-line and pretends to be Keanu Reeves and doesn't try 
to sell you Florida swampland, there is not a lot you can do about it," said 
Mike Godwin, staff counselor for Electronic Frontier Foundation, a public 
interest civil liberties organization based in Washington. "It's illegal to 
pose as a policeman. It's not against the law to pretend to be a movie star." 
</P>
<P>
 Financial gain and mental illness are two reasons people pose as celebrities 
in the real world, said Park Elliott Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist who 
testified at the trials of would-be assassin John Hinckley and the obsessed fan 
who killed actress Rebecca Schaeffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our culture places a premium on someone who is in close proximity to a 
celebrity," Dietz said. "The on-line arena makes it so simple because it's the 
best disguise of all." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's impossible to police the Internet, said attorney Jill Windwer, vice 
president of the Law Journal Seminars-Press in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law hasn't caught up to the technology yet," she said. "When someone does 
something wrong, who is held accountable? Right now, that's an unanswerable 
question." 
</P>
<P>
 America Online places the responsibility with its subscribers, said AOL 
spokeswoman Pam McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
 "They agree not to submit or display any inaccurate information," she said. 
"If a falsehood is brought to our attention, then we'll try to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've got more than a million subscribers now. It's impossible for us to 
track every user. It's up to people on the service to police themselves." P.J.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; BLUEPRINT FOR SUCCESS; NEWPORT BEACH ARCHITECT BRION S. 
JEANNETTE'S REPUTATION IS BUILT ON CUSTOM EXTRAVAGANZAS, BUT HE ALSO FULFILLS 
HIS VISION BY MAKING WORK A FAMILY AFFAIR AND KEEPING COMMUNITY SERVICE ON THE 
AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD BONHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Architect Brion S. Jeannette is making his weekly inspection of works in 
progress: One is the Aliso Rock house, an unprecedented Laguna Beach project in 
which a three-bedroom home is going inside a hollowed-out, 27-foot boulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Another, a few miles up the coast, is the four-lot site of author Dean 
Koontz's Italian Renaissance estate that eventually will have 255 doors, four 
laundry rooms and a library big enough to hold Koontz's 35,000-book collection. 
It will command a 240-degree view of the Newport coast, and, at 60,000 square 
feet, it will eclipse in size the much-publicized Aaron Spelling house in the 
Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles, which is the size of a football field. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 21st year as president of his Newport Beach firm, Jeannette, 48, enjoys 
a level of professional satisfaction matched only by a rewarding family and 
community life. His reputation for building unique, high-ticket homes -- some 
of them on difficult, cliffhanger sites -- is further cemented with each new 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 But although Jeannette revels in the challenge of palatial designs for 
millionaire clients, he is no stranger to the other side of the tracks. He grew 
up in the blue-collar community of Bellflower, sharing a small bedroom with his 
three brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because of this background, Jeannette refuses to turn a blind eye to 
the irony of building megamillion-dollar houses while homelessness is a problem 
just a few minutes' drive away. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a Los Angeles nonprofit group called Watts 13, Jeannette has been able 
to help recycle about a dozen houses that otherwise would have been destroyed 
during remodeling projects. Members of the group remove doors, sinks, lumber 
and other material for use in low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette's staff of 11 includes his wife of 28 years, Bonnie Jeannette, who 
serves as his business partner, financial and office manager, accountant and 
contract negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 The efficiency of the staff "allows me to be an architect," Jeannette says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Jeannette's work is in custom houses, particularly thematic designs 
such as New England Cape Cod, country French and Spanish, French and Italian 
Mediterranean. He has done 60 homes in the older part of Corona del Mar, where 
tight lots pose a particular challenge. His firm's annual billings are in the 
high six figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a master juggler, Jeannette keeps a lot of balls in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Aliso Rock and Koontz homes, he is working on 17 other 
custom projects. He built the Rancho Santa Margarita library, which opened 
earlier this month, and is sketching out ideas for the Aliso Viejo library. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette's ongoing work with the local Jewish community -- he volunteered to 
design the new Jewish Federation campus in Costa Mesa -- was recognized by 265 
friends, neighbors, former clients and business associates at a banquet in 
Santa Ana on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 For the occasion, the Jeannettes' son Erik, 21, flew in from the University of 
Colorado, where he is studying environmental engineering. Their other son, 
Jeff, 24, works as an architect at his parents' firm and is engaged to an 
architect. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge earthquake last year, Brion Jeannette worked with the 
state Office of Emergency Services to assemble an emergency damage-assessment 
team of volunteer architects. His knowledge of seismic standards brought him to 
the attention of Rick Ranous, senior structural engineer with the Office of 
Emergency Services. Ranous praised Jeannette's help in writing repair standards 
for single-family residences that were damaged in the Northridge quake.

 "His work has been all volunteer and very, very professional," Ranous said. 
"We've been working on the standards for two years, and he has always been 
there with input. It's hard work, and he's provided some valuable insights." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more enjoyable aspects of being an architect, Jeannette says, is 
watching the projects take shape. Today, he has joined his contractors at the 
Aliso Rock house to inspect the roof in preparation for an immense concrete 
pour. 
</P>
<P>
 As they work, none of the builders so much as glances at the Pacific, 
shimmering like hammered gold just yards away. The ocean, in fact, seems 
irrelevant, even tawdry, in comparison with the ingenuity of this project, 
scheduled for completion in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 To build the house, 1,200 cubic yards of earth were scooped out of the rock, 
like God's own jack-o'-lantern. Fourteen truckloads of extra-strength concrete 
were poured on the roof, enough for 100 garden-variety homes. The rock will 
eventually be recapped with artificial rock, the native foliage replanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The work site is now on the route of South County tour buses. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a project, in one of the architect's favorite phrases, that has "really 
stretched the envelope." 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase, in Jeannette's day-to-day practice, serves as a type of contract 
to his clients and to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 For clients such as the Mary Bowler family, which had tried various times over 
a 20-year period to develop its rock-studded Aliso Beach property, Jeannette's 
philosophy guarantees that he will not back away from the challenging site 
before the project is completed. They have since sold the property to software 
maker Dennis Morin. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette recalls that the Laguna Beach Design Review Board members, some of 
whom wanted the landmark rock to remain inviolate, "laughed me out of the 
office when I first made the proposal" to build inside the rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I told them I wouldn't take no for an answer. I made sure the owner was 
financially prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court to be able to 
build," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Building codes and zoning rules are seen by Jeannette and his staff not as 
limitations but as tools; to make room for an underground pistol range or 
bowling alley, he will dig to the limit of the property line. Or, if he can 
raise a home's upper floor six extra feet and still stay within the height 
limit, as he did for a 9,000-square-foot ocean-view house on Pelican Hill, 
potential view impairments are moved that much farther out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're stretching the envelope, as a lot of planning and building 
departments tell me we are, the whole reason is to capture everything that site 
has to offer," Jeannette says. "It's exciting to me to reach to whatever length 
to take full advantage of the site. We don't pierce the envelope, but we go as 
high as we can; we go as big as we can, we push it as far as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 As building director for the city of Newport Beach, Raimar Schuller is 
accustomed to the firm's aggressive approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brion Jeannette is unique in that he doesn't take anybody's word as the 
gospel truth on zoning. He figures it out for himself," Schuller says. "He'll 
file plans for a remodel, and then when you go see it, what you have is a 
project that's maybe all the way down to the concrete slab, and maybe he'll be 
rebuilding to the existing nonconforming specifications. He works hard for his 
clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller said that such regular testing of the codes, by Jeannette and other 
architects, keeps his office on its toes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many architects, Jeannette knew at an early age what his profession would 
be. He was 12 when the work of Frank Lloyd Wright first impressed him with its 
striking use of building environments, a quality that Jeannette tries to 
emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 He was influenced by parents who were musical and artistic. His father, Al, 
was a band leader, newspaper photographer and part-time inventor; Jeannette 
recalls him inventing the cab-over camper in 1959 as a way to give all six 
children a place to sleep during camping trips to Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
 During the mid-1960s at Downey High School, where Jeannette was CIF champion 
in wrestling, he met his wife-to-be while they were both cheerleaders. After 
graduation and marriage, they moved to Tucson with just $50 between them. There 
they both worked while Brion studied architecture at the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorlaine Cunningham of Newport Beach, a friend of the pair since high school, 
remembers them as "the perfect couple." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think back, it was always Bonnie supporting Brion, or vice versa, 
always a perfect complement, even in the business," Cunningham says. "Bonnie 
runs a tight ship at the office, and what I remember about Brion was that, even 
as an adolescent . . . he was willing to donate his time and talent to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Jeannette worked for about five years for other architects. 
In Tucson, he worked on a home whose eye-catching feature -- faux snow on the 
roof -- now makes him wince. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be 120 degrees in Tucson, and there you see this snow on the roof. 
It's somewhat comical," Jeannette says, joking that "in architecture, it's 
important to do your early practice in another city." 
</P>
<P>
 After returning to California in 1971, the couple began to establish an Orange 
County reputation. Initially, Jeannette did a lot of back-yard trellises and 
landscaping work in his Newport Heights neighborhood, where he has since built 
more than two dozen homes and remodeled 25 more. The firm's first remodeling 
project, for a friend and neighbor, financed the birth of the Jeannettes' 
second son. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette begins his day at 5:30 with a four-mile jog. Although he began 
running in 1978 as a way to get in shape, he has since qualified twice for the 
Boston Marathon and says his workout serves as a "cleansing" process for a mind 
that by necessity is packed with detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most architects, Jeannette regularly wears the hats not only of artist 
and mathematician but also of geologist, physicist, politician and -- when 
partners disagree on a remodeling project -- marriage counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 His hectic schedule ("When I hit the sack you can hear my eyes slam shut," he 
says) is balanced with regular vacations in Cabo San Lucas and at the family 
cabin in Arrowbear Lake. Weekends he reserves for family life at the home he 
designed and built within walking distance of the office. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Jeannettes built their roomy Southwestern-style home in 1985, friends 
and neighbors were invited to add character to the house with their ideas and 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Witek, a friend and longtime contractor for Jeannette, made the doors 
and hand-hewed the 85 white fir beams on the ceilings, while a neighbor 
supplied willow branches for a curved banister. On a wall near the entry, a 
friend painted petroglyphic figures representing the Jeannette family -- 
including the family pooch, Aspen, who was given an elevated dog run outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the home's energy-efficient features, such as belvedere windows that 
let in light without trapping heat, are echoed in Jeannette's commercial 
projects. Such projects constitute about 10% of the firm's work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opening of the $6-million Rancho Santa Margarita library earlier this 
month, Jeannette stood back "like a fly on the wall" to see how some of the 
2,000 first-day visitors interacted with his design. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most satisfying thing you can do is create something like this and have 
people go through it and see their level of interest in the design," he says. 
"I look at the library just like doing a custom residence. That attention to 
detail is just as important, but a lot of architects who do commercial work 
don't put thought into what people live with in their daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette says his commitment to environmentally sound design and construction 
(all of his designs feature either active or passive solar systems) was 
influenced both by his late-1960s college years and by periods of economic 
recession, when cost-cutting designs were critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Before anyone could enter the Rancho Santa Margarita library, for example, 
Jeannette insisted that the finished building go through a full month of 
"off-gassing" -- a period in which new materials leech off toxicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The synergism of all the new carpets, paints and furniture off-gassing can be 
toxic, especially if the building's airflow is poor," Jeannette says. "It needs 
to air out. So we actually write into the specifications that the building must 
go through an off-gassing period before it's used." 
</P>
<P>
 An architect's education, Jeannette says, never ends, and he's proud of his 
firm's devotion to energy efficiency and authenticity in design. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always thinking: How does this space relate to that space? How do all the 
spaces relate to (the) environment? What is the impact of the sun, wind and 
views on the plan?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette says one of his most satisfying exercises in planning a home in a 
tight space came a couple of years ago, when the Los Angeles Times asked him to 
design a house that former President George Bush could conceivably build on an 
exceptionally narrow lot that the Bushes owned in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 presidential campaign, Democrats claimed Bush had no intention of 
building on the lot, which has a buildable area just 13 feet wide by 110 feet 
long. They charged that it was little more than a means for Bush to claim Texas 
residency as a state income tax dodge. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette sat down with his sketch pad and, through clever use of subterranean 
space, not only designed a house, but came up with a 10,000-square-foot estate 
that included quarters for the Secret Service, a 15-seat theater, walk-in 
closets, a 14-person dining room, an exercise room and wine cellar, plus a 
seven-car garage. The cost to build it, Jeannette said, would be $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 (Bush did eventually build on the lot, after buying adjacent property, but it 
wasn't Jeannette's design. In 1993, the Bushes moved into a 4,000-square-foot, 
Georgian-style brick house on that property; the home and lot are appraised at 
$538,300.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette's sketch pad doesn't stay home when he and Bonnie travel to Europe. 
Recent trips to southern France, Tuscany and Venice provided a firsthand 
education in authentic Italian Renaissance architecture for his Koontz project. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get architecture in your blood, it's almost scary how much time you 
can put into it," Jeannette says. "It's so consuming. We go on trips, and it's 
looking at details, crowns, cornices, window trims, why doors are eight feet 
high or 10 feet high -- you're just dissecting all the time. Which is good, 
because it gives you an idea of how to make it relate to a project you have." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette's eyes light up at the prospect of working on the Koontz house, 
which he says will be "completely authentic" Italian Renaissance. Genuine 
carving and statuary, rather than molds, will be used for the ornate style 
throughout, and the building relief work will be accomplished with real 
stonework rather than wood framing. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Palazzo Rospo by Koontz (in a reference to "Wind in the Willows"), 
the house, complete with two-story library and staff garage, is due to be 
completed by 1999. Four members of Jeannette's staff will spend about 4,000 
hours on the project's technical drawings alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Jeannette enjoys being pushed to such heights by his clients, he says 
he strives for a balance both in his firm's work and in how he uses his time. 
</P>
<P>
 Office phones are often used for volunteer work that Bonnie Jeannette 
organizes, including fund-raising for homeless shelters, abortion-rights 
activism, food and blood drives and produce picking with Orange County Harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of Temple Bat Yahm of Newport Beach, Jeannette joins his wife in 
these and other unpaid projects, such as his months of design work on the 
Jewish Federation complex. 
</P>
<P>
 As he inspects the site, which will include a preschool, Hebrew school, senior 
citizen center and offices, he is greeted fondly by the office staff and 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine doing anything other than this," Jeannette says as he views 
the plans for the complex. "I have to say it's the best job in the world, and 
the great thing is, it's a family affair. We have to pinch ourselves often." 
Profile: Brion S. Jeannette 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 48 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Born in Los Angeles, raised in Bellflower; lives in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married to Bonnie; two sons, Jeff, 24, and Erik, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Trout fishing, camping, traveling, skiing, running. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggest disappointment: After his firm was selected over dozens of others to 
design the UC Irvine chancellor's house, the project was terminated because of 
funding problems and concerns over gnatcatcher habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 On remodeling and marriages: "We've only had one case that actually resulted 
in a divorce. Unless you really know how to handle not only the clients but the 
contractors . . . some people can just go sideways on you. I didn't get 
training in marriage counseling in college. My job is to make sure that we 
level off these sticky or messy areas and get everyone working in the same 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 On working closely with family members: "Architecture is fluent in our house. 
It's impossible to turn off. Bonnie is instrumental in the business; she 
understands it. She's as absorbed as I am. Now, watching Jeff mature as an 
architect is extremely satisfying. We're all in the industry in some sense."

GUIDING THE FUTURE OF FILM; IT TOOK EXPERIENCE. IT TOOK VISION. IT TOOK AN 
INSIDE TRACK TO HOLLYWOOD'S ELITE. ELIZABETH MONK DALEY PUT IT ALL TOGETHER TO 
PLACE USC ON THE CUTTING EDGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Part of the problem was the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not problem. Elizabeth Monk Daley hates the word problem . "Let's say, a 
real challenge , which is by far the better word," says the dean of the USC 
School of Cinema-Television. 
</P>
<P>
 OK. So the school had this real challenge -- overcoming the impact of a 
cluster of campus buildings named after such industry mucky-mucks and USC 
supporters as George Lucas and Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at the names on the buildings and you say, 'USC Cinema's a real rich 
school.' Well, hello . It's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when Daley became the nation's first female film school dean in May, 
1991, USC Cinema was lugging an $800,000 deficit. Endowment? Ha. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, a mere 3 1/2 years later, it has not only paid off the deficit, but 
it's more than $8 million closer to its $60-million endowment goal. How? 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of help from our friends," she says somewhat demurely. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, by doing what the industry does best -- networking. And Daley 
is a networker par excellence. In her relatively short stint as dean, she has 
parlayed her talent for it into a bouquet of forward-looking changes for USC. 
</P>
<P>
 For her trouble, USC recently gave her a second top job -- as executive 
director of the new Annenberg Center for Communication. The center was spawned 
last year with a $120-million grant from media mogul and former Ambassador 
Walter Annenberg to nurture research and teaching about new and interactive 
media. Daley, selected from more than 30 candidates, was prized for her film 
and television experience and contacts, USC President Steven Sample says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing Dean Daley has in my judgment is her great vision," he says. 
"I think more than any other person I've ever met, she can articulate and 
understands what's happening in this communications revolution. She has a great 
ability to inspire and motivate other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Daley's tenure, the film school, which she continues to head, has done 
more with its money than sock it away. It has wooed advice and financial 
support from a wide swath of industry professionals; made the first 
university-produced feature-length motion picture; hired a former William 
Morris agent to help ease students' transition into the real world, and 
attracted a $2-million donation from Time Warner Inc. to endow the dean's chair 
and get her salary off the annual operating tab of $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Chunks of the curriculum also have been turned on their heads: USC has 
cross-fertilized new programs and degrees with the engineering and business 
schools; founded a master's degree program for computer animators, and 
established a seminar series for minority screenwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even industry grown-ups are being invited to share USC Cinema's glimpse into 
the next century: The school recently formed the Entertainment Technology 
Center, a think tank of pros in entertainment, computers and technology that's 
looking at new ways to join forces. One embryonic ETC blueprint targeted at the 
film industry, Holly Net, would consolidate a wide range of motion picture 
services in a computer database. The plan is for USC to help provide long-term 
R&D for Hollywood, which tends to be focused on short-term goals and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely important to me that we constantly have our finger on the 
pulse of what's going on out there," Daley says, "and that we're taking a 
long-term look at where this industry's headed and that we're making sure that 
everybody who leaves here is ready for the next 10, 15, 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Her approach appears to be paying off. Last spring, USC and New York 
University tied as the nation's top film schools, according to the U.S. News & 
World Report Annual Guide to America's Best Graduate Schools, which weighs 
scholarship, curriculum and quality of faculty. USC Cinema, shepherding more 
than 900 students a year, has graduated such industry luminaries as Ron Howard, 
James Ivory, Robert Zemeckis and David Wolper. 
</P>
<P>
 One industry executive recruited by Daley to help steer the ETC lays much of 
the credit for USC Cinema's latest advances at the dean's feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say that figuring out what to do is 5% of the assignment and 
figuring out how to do it and getting it done is 95%, and she's really great at 
both but particularly at getting it done," says Steven Koltai, Warner Bros. 
senior vice president for corporate strategic planning and development. "She 
has a way of dealing with people and motivating people that is quite 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Daley's office bears evidence of someone who focuses on other people. 
Emmy nomination plaques lining a wall honor "Tell Them I'm a Mermaid" and "Who 
Parks in Those Spaces," TV documentaries about the disabled that she produced 
for Taper Media Enterprises in the mid-'80s. Daley, 51, is equally unassuming, 
given to easy smiles and conservative suits in muted colors. A faint lilt in 
her voice betrays her Dallas beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not surprisingly, Daley's mother was a teacher, now retired. What is 
surprising, though, is that her mother's experience initially turned Daley off 
to a career in education. She had a ringside view of the difficulties of living 
on a paltry teacher's salary after her father, a housing contractor, died when 
she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "This woman did not have an easy life," Daley says of her mother. "And I can 
remember saying as a little girl that I would never teach. But obviously a 
university's a little different situation. They take much better care of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Dean Daley is very much her mother's child. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't teaching as much as she was very interested in theater and she did 
a lot of storytelling. My earliest memories with her are of being taken places 
to tell stories. She would go tell stories in hospitals and drag me along and 
let me tell part of the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Daley studied theater at Tulane University, and then took off for Paris for a 
year during which she studied mime and commedia dell'arte with Jacques LeCoq 
and acting at the Comedie Francaise. 
</P>
<P>
 When she returned to the tumultuous United States in 1965, Daley pursued a 
doctorate in theater, with a minor in film, at the University of Wisconsin at 
Madison. There, she hid from the furor surrounding the Vietnam War, a climate 
that helped breed her concern for social problems. 
</P>
<P>
 She followed her first husband to Washington, D.C., where she helped set up an 
experimental theater program for the Wolftrap Foundation. From there, Daley 
segued into experimentation with video, forming Videocraft, an independent 
producer of documentaries for public television, the federal government and the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-'70s, Daley was divorced and raising her daughter, Shannon, now a 
24-year-old clinical psychology student working toward a doctorate at UCLA. She 
met her current husband, American Film Institute Deputy Director James Hindman, 
while they were teaching at American University, Daley's professional home from 
1978-82. 
</P>
<P>
 Daley and Hindman recognized, however, that their TV and film production 
opportunities would be limited in Washington. When AFI offered Hindman a job in 
Los Angeles in 1982, they shipped their careers west -- they now live in Santa 
Monica -- and Daley spent five years producing TV movies and specials for Taper 
Media Enterprises. That company was swallowed by MGM/UA Television, and Daley 
developed a couple of HBO movies for it before launching her own production 
company in 1988. Daley/Hodges Productions has developed cable-TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was while Daley was finishing a project for MGM that people started calling 
her with the same proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend called and said, 'You know you're always talking about how important 
you think it is for women and minorities to be more involved in the industry 
and about new kinds of creative work getting done." Rather than take another 
studio deal, would she consider USC's opening for a production program chair? 
</P>
<P>
 Daley initially balked at the idea, then remembered that she'd been impressed 
by the USC interns she had worked with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew that they weren't supposed to direct the picture, but they would 
put on their gloves before they touched a hot light," she says. "And there was 
a professionalism about them that I really liked." 
</P>
<P>
 So after a USC recruiter called, Daley agreed to join the school in 1989 as 
chair of the Film and Television Production Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the ethics of the place. I liked the sense of the ethical 
responsibility of media. I also liked their sense of responsibility to another 
generation.  
</P>
<P>
 "And it's a pretty phenomenal legacy. You know, this place is 65 years old. 
And when you look at the filmmakers they've turned out, you thought, 'Well, if 
there's a chance to kind of shepherd that and keep that going, that's really a 
very worthwhile thing to spend some time doing.' " At the end of her first 
year, then-Dean Frank Daniel resigned to return to screenwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing I was in the provost office with him saying, 'Your colleagues 
think you ought to be dean of this school,' " she says. "It was just such an 
overwhelming mandate from the faculty to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Daley became dean and quickly went to work. Her top priority was to recruit a 
board of councilors, a band of the industry's heaviest hitters who could help 
with fund-raising, networking and carving out school policy to keep USC in tune 
with the needs of the business.  
</P>
<P>
 She picked up the phone and asked for a meeting with producer Ray Stark 
because he'd endowed USC's Peter Stark Motion Picture Producing Program, named 
after his son who died in 1970.  
</P>
<P>
 Stark picked up the phone and called producer and former Columbia Pictures 
chief Frank Price, who agreed to see Daley. 
</P>
<P>
 Price picked up the phone and lined up a board, which includes among its 16 
members David Geffen, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Brandon Tartikoff, Marvin 
Davis and David Wolper. 
</P>
<P>
 Voila . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Price, who chairs the board, applauds Daley's ability to recruit people to the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked what she had to say about her approach to the school," Price says. "I 
was particularly interested in her attitudes about making sure that there would 
be a great emphasis on recruiting women and minorities for the student body." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the board's makeup illustrates the problem. Much like the industry 
itself, the panel is made up, except for Sidney Poitier and Marcy Carsey, of 
white men. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is "mostly guys and it's mostly white," Daley says. "And one of the 
goals of the board when they begin to set out their mission, and one of the 
reasons they're anxious to raise endowment, is they firmly believe as I do that 
this school is one of the major gateways into this industry.  
</P>
<P>
 "About 75% of our grads walk straight out of here into Hollywood. Now if we 
can diversify the school, then we have somehow begun to diversify this 
industry. And yes, it's ethically right to diversify it. It's also just darn 
good business." 
</P>
<P>
 Key to that strategy is raising endowment, so the school can depend less on 
its steep tuition and offer more financial aid. Tuition is $16,000 a year, and 
students are told to expect to spend $25,000 figuring in living expenses. Even 
with USC Cinema far short of its endowment goal -- which yields interest that 
ultimately frees up funds for the operating budget -- 70% of the students 
receive financial aid toward tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we're very heavily tuition-dependent," Daley says, "which 
means that if I get a terrific minority student walking in the door or a 
terrific -- doesn't have to be a minority -- a terrific student walking in the 
door who I'd really like to fund, I often don't have the flexibility to do 
that. And what endowment provides you is stability. Otherwise, it's much too 
volatile a situation." 
</P>
<P>
 So last June, USC Cinema saw to it that a chunk of the industry suited up for 
a 65th anniversary benefit, the first fund-raising bash in recent memory. Art 
Buchwald spoke. Eight hundred supporters ate chicken. Benefit co-chair Steven 
Spielberg regaled the audience even though USC Cinema had rejected him because 
of crummy grades: "Standards were so high that many of today's finest 
filmmakers were unable to attend." 
</P>
<P>
 One who slipped in was George Lucas, among the school's most prominent 
supporters, who was given the first USC Award for Leadership in the 
Entertainment Industry that evening. Lucas had spearheaded a $12-million 
fund-raising drive a decade earlier to build five of the seven buildings in the 
Cinema complex, and Daley's award presentation patted the school's back as well 
as that of its illustrious alum. 
</P>
<P>
 "In nearly every year since 1950 at least one USC graduate has been nominated 
for an Academy Award," she told the black-tied crowd at the Beverly Hilton, 
trotting out the school's favorite stats. "Ten of the 12 highest-grossing films 
have had USC alumni in key creative and/or production positions. . . . George 
Lucas is one of the best measures of the efficacy of (USC's) educational 
philosophy. He once said of USC that, 'almost everything I learned, I learned 
there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Daley said something else that night revealing about her deanship: "In 
celebrating the school, we celebrate cinema -- USC and the film industry are 
inextricably intertwined. We intend, and have every reason to believe, that it 
will remain so." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't always the case. Marcia Rodrigues, a film editor and former wife 
of Lucas who had also been active in the capital construction drive, was given 
no voice in the school's direction until Daley called her six months into her 
tenure as dean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow," Rodrigues thought. "It's about time." 
</P>
<P>
 They met at a San Francisco restaurant and Rodrigues jumped at the chance to 
rewrite her educational script for new generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the students leave with their degrees in hand, they're just cut loose 
in a big cold world that couldn't care less," Rodrigues says. "So we had lots 
of discussions about what could be done to help bridge that gap.  
</P>
<P>
 "My second concern was that many, many, many of the film students want to work 
on motion pictures, and it's really unfortunate that the school can't provide 
them with that experience because of limited funding and a zillion reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Rodrigues put donations where her mouth was. She gives USC more than 
$100,000 a year to fund the office of Larry Auerbach, a veteran of the William 
Morris Agency who advises students on making the leap to the real world. She 
also donated $1 million toward the first full-length feature film ever financed 
by a university and intended for public distribution. That project is still in 
post-production and title-testing, but Rodrigues has already kicked in another 
million for a second feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Auerbach, who has observed Daley's leadership style since he joined the school 
two years ago, says one of her strengths is her ability to work a room. 
</P>
<P>
 "She fights hard to get the money out of the university to run the school 
properly," he says. "She's tough but good. I see the company she keeps in the 
university, and I think that's important. You've got to move around, and when 
you need help you know where to go, and she reaches out and gets it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Daley doesn't just court bigwigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Bob Laws, a graduate student in production who works as an assistant in 
the dean's office: "She's very busy and she deals with very high-powered 
people, but she always has time to listen to me and to my comments about the 
curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
 For Daley, running a film school is like making a movie -- it's a 
collaborative venture. Some observers have wondered whether it's too 
collaborative, whether it stifles creativity to bring the full commercial 
weight of Hollywood to bear on budding careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I get asked questions (by other academics) like, am I embarrassed 
by our close relationship to Hollywood? The answer is, 'No, not at all.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people ought to experiment. And we try to encourage people to take 
chances. The message you really want to get across is that trying to duplicate 
what Hollywood is doing this year probably is not even the best way to be 
successful in a commercial career. You know, Frank Price has pointed out that 
he didn't make 'Boyz N the Hood' because it was like what was made last year. 
He made it because he saw a unique and original voice in (USC grad John) 
Singleton. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the message I really want to get across is not to be experimental or 
commercial. It's to find your own voice." 
</P>

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Elizabeth Monk Daley 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 51. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: No; born in Dallas, lives in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married to James Hindman, deputy director of the American Film 
Institute. One daughter, Shannon Daley, 24, a clinical psychology graduate 
student at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Movies, natch; her new getaway in Taos, N.M., and exotic travel. "My 
husband and I spent last summer in Burma, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. We did 
some lectures in Burma and visited with filmmakers, but the rest of it was 
truly because we love to get to know other cultures."  
</P>
<P>
 On courting Hollywood for cash: "People understand that when you fund 
something like USC, it's not really charity. You're investing in the future of 
your industry. And this is something we need to do. If you want a next 
generation, you've got to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 On "enlightened self-interest": "Enlightened self-interest is a real good 
thing. And I mean enlightened is the operative word. If you've got a great 
script and somebody's looking for a project, you serve each other very well. 
It's a win-win situation. When we get companies in here and they give us 
equipment and money and they help us, it's a win-win situation. We win; we 
educate our students better. They win big-time because they get product 
loyalty. They get good feedback on their equipment. And they've usually met the 
future filmmakers."  
</P>
<P>
 On running the show: "One of the secrets of good stewardship is to be sure, 
when you have people who want to help you, that you find ways that are 
meaningful to them to let them help you, instead of trying to tell them what 
they should be doing."

SOCIAL CLIMES / TIME OUT; A WOMAN WHO REALLY KNOWS HOW TO PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terri Mandell's epiphany came when she received an invitation to a dinner 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Not just any dinner party -- this was a formal affair at a country club in 
another town on a Friday at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It required everyone to come home from work early enough to change into 
formal clothes," she recalls, "then drive on the freeway at 5:30 on a Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, 'I know these people really well, they're smart people, how 
can they make a mistake like this? Why Friday, why not Saturday?' That's when 
it hit me. They don't know these little basic rules." 
</P>
<P>
 So Mandell, an author and lecturer, decided to set down some rules in the book 
"When Good People Throw Bad Parties: A Guide to Party Politics for Hosts and 
Guests" (First House Press, $8.95). 
</P>
<P>
 She covers host and guest etiquette ("It is definitely improper to bring an 
uninvited guest to a party of any kind unannounced"), common party problems 
(men and women break into separate groups), wedding wisdom ("Wedding traditions 
. . . are not set in cement") and surprise-party tips ("Don't throw a surprise 
party for a divorced, separated or presently quarreling couple in the hopes of 
reconciling them"). 
</P>
<P>
 Mandell's knowledge comes from years of party-going and throwing, and 
encountering the good, the bad and the ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 She relates her tales from the front lines over coffee at Aroma Coffee & Tea 
Company in Studio City, a neighborhood hangout that's within walking distance 
of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 The party she went to the night before is on her mind -- a lavish 300-person 
affair given by a recording-equipment firm that was rambling and unfocused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just all these people thrown into a room," Mandell says. "At some 
point someone should have gone up to the microphone and said, 'On behalf of the 
company we welcome you, I want to give special thanks to so-and-so.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In a chapter titled "Parties From Hell: Unforgettably Embarrassing Moments," 
Mandell tells of a surprise party given by a friend for his wife, in which he 
asked guests to "show up any time after 8 p.m." The couple had also just moved 
into a new home and had no furniture, so everyone had to sit on the floor while 
eating the only food provided -- wine, cake and fruit salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the outdoor party in 104-degree heat (the house was off-limits 
for some reason) where guests "sat around panting like dogs, drenched in 
sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandell credits her mother with teaching her the nuts-and-bolts of party 
hosting. "She's aggressive, and at her parties, when men and women will 
separate, she'll work really hard to put them together. She'll just march right 
up to people and say, 'C'mon, you guys, let's fix this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Mandell learned that the key to a successful party isn't the 
food, the lighting or the table decor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The communication element of a party is the only thing that matters . . . 
making sure that people are comfortable and feel emotionally safe and can 
connect with other people. Because what's the purpose of going to a party? You 
go to meet people." 
</P>
<P>
 She gives this advice to hosts: "The best way to do introductions is to give 
information. 'This is Terri, she just wrote a book.' 'Or, let me introduce you 
to Jane, she's a single mom.' You give information. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you don't have to stick around long at all. Here's this person, here's 
his bio, and then you're out of there. The host should always be looking around 
for loose people, making sure they're OK, not asking, 'Can I fill your drink,' 
but, 'Who would you like to meet?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Mixing is everything," she says emphatically. "But it'll be a disaster if you 
take all these people, invite them to your house and just leave them there. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that works is to have some kind of an activity, an ice-breaker." 
One idea she suggests for New Year's Eve is to have guests say where they want 
to be a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did that at a party the other night. It was charming -- older people said 
they wanted to be alive a year from now, someone said she wanted to be 
pregnant, someone else said he wanted to have his house sold. And some people 
didn't want to do it, so they left the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when the circle broke up, everyone was laughing and just totally 
supportive of what other people said, no one judged or made fun of them. And 
people found somebody to talk to they hadn't talked to before." 
</P>
<P>
 With the holidays looming, Mandell advocates breaking from the status quo of 
traditions, if possible, and not feeling locked into years-old patterns. A case 
in point: spending your own money to travel thousands of miles to be with 
family members that you may not even like. 
</P>
<P>
 She mixes up family, friends and co-workers at holiday parties, and says: "It 
turns out they just love each other. Everybody thinks in this culture there's 
this separation between old people and young people, between ethnicities and 
between genders. There's a place where you get to where that's all irrelevant."

AIDS MEMORIAL GROVE AN OASIS FOR GRIEF, HEALING; SAN FRANCISCO: A BOWL-SHAPED 
DELL IN GOLDEN GATE PARK IS SEEN AS A PLACE FOR MEMORIAL SERVICES, A PLACE FOR 
REMEMBERING, HONORING VICTIMS OF THE DISEASE. 
</P>

<P>
 For volunteers who pulled the weeds, carried the rocks and planted the trees, 
the AIDS Memorial Grove helped bring peace of mind long before the arbor's 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow it helps work through the sadness and grief," said Phyllis Gomez, who 
came with her husband, Hank, almost every month to help clear the long 
neglected area of Golden Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have our loved ones back, but we can remember them," said Gomez, who 
lost her son, Michael, to the disease. "Working here is an expression of caring 
and renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 With other volunteers with AIDS or with family and friends with AIDS, the 
couple applauded Thursday as the "thunk" of a nine-ton Sierra granite boulder 
dropping into place marked the official ground-breaking at the grove. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony was timed in conjunction with World AIDS Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Its creators intend the bowl-shaped dell as a place for memorial services and 
a place for remembering and honoring, a living memorial to the thousands of 
Americans lost to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that happens when a hole is torn in your life is that you fall 
through," said Dr. Brad Steward, medical director of the Sonoma AIDS hospice. 
"This place is a place to fall to. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a healing place. I don't mean cure, but a place to help in getting 
through the darkness." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years from now, the glen will include a Dogwood Crescent, a Pine 
Crescent, a Redwood Circle and the Fern Grotto, in addition to a main portal 
set with native stones and a south portal. 
</P>
<P>
 A meadow overlook and wide paths will make the area accessible to people with 
limited mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape architect Michael Boland tried to take his ideas for the layout from 
the way the grove was used by the people drawn to the project from the 
beginning. For them, the idea, not the finished project, was important. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute we named it, they started coming here," Boland said.

OWNERS HAVE WON -- TIME TO SETTLE STRIKE; COMMENTARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now the owners have put their Santa Claus suits over their Grinch suits and 
are singing, "Don we now our gay apparel." Boy do they look good. 
</P>
<P>
 They're willing to defer their salary-cap doomsday and go back to the 
negotiating table, as if they'd ever been there before. Either they're going to 
play Santa and permit a compromise to evolve, or they're going to hide behind 
this gesture of good will while they're really the Grinches who stole baseball 
and gave us replacement games. 
</P>
<P>
 History tells us to question their sincerity. They would put a lump of coal in 
every stocking. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners created this deadline, just as they forced the strike, and now 
they're making the grand gesture of postponing doomsday. Maybe they think they 
will look better when the National Labor Relations Board gets to examining the 
evidence that shows the owners didn't bargain in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 What they should have done was listen to what the players were saying Monday 
and Tuesday at Rye Brook and said, "Tell us more." Except that what they really 
want is to break the union that has bothered them for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the owners had any sense, they wouldn't impose their salary cap, because 
they've already reached their goal and driven down the salary structure for 
1994," said Dick Moss, agent and formerly Marvin Miller's No. 2 man in the 
union. "They should say, 'Let's go ahead and play the season, as the union 
offered, and have a study committee.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Moss' evidence is the split in salaries that has been developing for the past 
couple of seasons. Tim Wallach, for instance, recently signed as a free agent 
for $1.5 million, down from $3.3, after a shortened season of .280 and 23 
homers and 78 RBI. What that indicates is that Gregg Jefferies and Paul 
O'Neill, the guys on top, still command big bucks, but that the owners can play 
hardball with the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners have been grumbling for years that they can live with the investment 
for the important players but the money for backup infielders made them crazy. 
So here's the solution: Be smart enough to make the distinction which is which. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are so silly," Moss said. "They should say, 'We've won!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The owners wouldn't say that. What they're hearing is the voice of Stan 
Kasten, who comes to the Braves from the Hawks of the league of the first 
salary cap, saying they've come this far, cancelled the playoffs and the World 
Series, that they're not about to give in now. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they go out and sign Jefferies and O'Neill and say that's evidence they 
can't live with the present system because owners can't control themselves. 
They wail financial calamity. So the notion of restraint gets laid on the 
players when it ought to be better revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every free agent who's not a superstar suffered a terrible consequence," Moss 
said. "That shows you they know how to control free agency." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the owners have railed at the salaries won in arbitration by 
players who are less than superstars. They said that was the real sticking 
point, not free agency. "It's hardly been discussed," union head Don Fehr said. 
Miller said there were ways to guarantee fairness to players other than 
arbitration, but the owners never made an issue of it with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues here have been the same since the beginning: One side insists on a 
salary cap, the other side says it can't have a salary cap. I certainly can't 
argue that players make a lot of money, even too much money considering their 
role in our society, but the idea of a fixed salary cap across the country in 
my business, their business or your business is not right. Unless the owners 
can show good reason why the players should accept it, and they haven't. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA showed reason for it at the time, and now should find another way. The 
NFL shouldn't have it. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the baseball cap would eliminate free agency and return player 
control to the old days, even if at a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners think they can break the union now. That's why they threw out Fay 
Vincent, who might have forced a conciliation, two years ago. That's why they 
waited 18 months after declaring their intention to reopen the contract before 
making a proposal. And now they have returned to that as their last proposal 
before the impasse. They already had forced an issue by withholding their 
payment obligations to the pension program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union had no option but to strike," Miller said recently. "The owners had 
the opportunity of a lifetime to attack the union." 
</P>
<P>
 They changed the voting procedure so that it would be harder for the 
dissenters to block the group. Peter Angelos, before he bought the Baltimore 
Orioles, was a lawyer on the side of labor. He's on record opposing the end of 
negotiations and scab players. "The owners have tried their damnedest to bring 
him into line, including keeping two Washington-area applicants on the hook for 
expansion," Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now suppose they shut down, imposed their impasse and went forward to open the 
season with strike-breakers and sandlot players. It would be a long time before 
the NLRB could hear the argument that the owners acted in bad faith, because 
the national safety is not involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these years, the one consistent thing about the owners is that they 
listened to the advice of their lawyers," Moss said, "and that's what makes the 
most money for the lawyers. And I'm a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most outrageous situations. The lawyers' advice makes no 
sense, but it produces litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 But suppose there is no settlement and the season opens with whomever they can 
get to pass the picket line. Suppose they had opening day and there was no one 
to open the gate or turn on the lights. If the players union, one of the most 
successful unions in the country, were broken, it would send a terrible message 
to working unionists. Suppose the electricians and the plumbers refused to 
cross the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a pipe dream. But suppose they turned on the lights for replacement 
games and they showed a lot of empty seats. That's another idea. 
</P>
<P>
 They have another chance to get this done across the table. The owners 
shouldn't let it get away.

TARPLEY FEELING HEAT AGAIN; PRO BASKETBALL: HIS RUN-IN WITH DALLAS COACH DICK 
MOTTA RESULTS IN ONE-GAME SUSPENSION AND RENEWS DOUBTS ABOUT MAVERICK CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUN POWELL, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you went on headlines alone on the latest Roy Tarpley incident, then they 
certainly raised your red flags to half-staff: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Motta Slaps One-Game Suspension on Tarpley. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mavericks Center, Coach Exchange Heated Words. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tarpley Displays Questionable Behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the large-type messages that rumbled out of Dallas Wednesday. But 
none had anything to do with your first impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Tarpley was angry, and yes, he may have snorted, but not the white 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 He was penalized for nothing more than disagreeing with Dallas Mavericks Coach 
Dick Motta over playing time. Tarpley checked in against the Los Angeles Lakers 
during the first quarter Tuesday night and was pulled moments later. He glared 
as he walked past Motta on the Dallas bench. It was the third time in a week 
that Motta was issued The Stare, and apparently that was three times too many. 
</P>
<P>
 They had words. They argued in the Mavericks' locker room at halftime. And 
before the third quarter, Motta told Tarpley to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Tarpley been any other National Basketball Association player (the New 
Jersey Nets' Chris Morris, for example) this would have been passed off as 
another rebellion-against-authority incident. But this was Tarpley, who's 
coming off a three-year ban for refusing to take a drug test. So unless you 
knew the complete story, your worst fears or suspicions about Tarpley 
undoubtedly materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarpley may be back in the NBA, but he's on lifetime parole because of his 
many previous problems, all involving chemical dependency. That means any 
abnormal signs given by Tarpley automatically will bring suspicion and doubt, 
whether warranted or not. 
</P>
<P>
 He forfeited his right to be anything less than a solid citizen five years 
ago, when he received the first of his two suspensions for violating the 
league's anti-drug program. During his first tour of duty with the Mavericks 
before the three-year ban, just about every odd signal from Tarpley eventually 
led to more serious incidents. The missed practices, missed planes and run-ins 
with Dallas police only covered up the savage work the demons were doing to 
Tarpley's NBA career and more important, his life. 
</P>
<P>
 During his exile, Tarpley served time in John Lucas' rehab clinic, played on 
Lucas' U.S. Basketball League team of recovered users and then spent two 
seasons in Greece before the NBA approved his reinstatement in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks collapsed without him, winning only 23 games the last two 
seasons, so they were thrilled to welcome him back. Their sympathetic owner, 
Donald Carter, signed him to a five-year deal worth almost $4 million annually. 
He arrived in camp with a fresh attitude and although he had not played in an 
NBA game since Nov. 9, 1990, he felt confident he could "be my old self," the 
player who averaged 17 points and 12 rebounds over a two-year span in the late 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 During camp, Carter was asked if he was being too forgiving regarding Tarpley. 
He smiled and proved his sanity by pointing to the zero-tolerance drug clause 
in Tarpley's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Carter said: "Tell you the truth, I probably had doubts about Roy every 
day when he was gone. I'll probably continue to have doubts. But I don't have 
time to listen to those doubts. To have doubts is to pass judgment and that's 
not for me to do." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take Tarpley long to unearth those dormant doubts. During the last 
few days of camp, in the wee hours one morning, he was ticketed for speeding. 
Hours later, the same car driven by Tarpley was totaled on a Dallas highway. 
Tarpley said he loaned the car to a friend, who reported the accident. In both 
instances, Tarpley was charged with violating nothing except our suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 He's had his moments on the court, scoring 24 points in only 26 minutes 
against the Charlotte Hornets last week. But the Mavericks belong to Jamal 
Mashburn, Jim Jackson and Jason Kidd. They work best as an up-tempo, fast-break 
team. Tarpley runs the floor well but remains in poor shape, and that's why 
Motta rations his minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of working his way into condition, Tarpley worked his way into Motta's 
doghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be curious to see how Tarpley reacts to this latest, less serious 
setback. Some teammates worried that Tarpley would respond the wrong way by 
straying down the wrong path again. Motta gives Tarpley more credit than that. 
</P>
<P>
 But like anyone else who has followed Tarpley's career, Motta has his hidden 
doubts, too. "He's a great talent who almost sniffed his life away," Motta 
said. "If he's totally interested in turning his life around, I'll help him. 
He's created his situation and he's the only one who can improve it. I don't 
have any illusions that he has a hard road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want him to slip back into the abyss. If he does that, he's a poor 
lost soul."

COMMENTARY; SMALL TRACKS CARRY A BIG BURDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the end of racing at Charles Town has stunned an entire community, 
the track's demise can hardly be considered a surprise. In fact, it was 
surprising that Charles Town survived as long as it did, because such small 
tracks have become an anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, of course, when places like Charles Town were a cherished 
part of the American racing landscape. When I came to Washington in the 1960s, 
I regularly attended the races in West Virginia rather than Maryland; Charles 
Town and Shenandoah Downs treated their customers better, and they had an 
intimacy and charm the bigger tracks lacked. They were innovative too, 
pioneering wagers like the twin double that generated unprecedented excitement 
for bettors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main reason for the prosperity of such tracks was that they operated 
in markets relatively free of competition for the gambling and entertainment 
dollar. They flourished until technology and television changed the world. Just 
as major-league baseball telecasts killed many of the minor-league franchises, 
so did the proliferation of off-track betting and simulcasting by major tracks 
hurt the small ones. The minor tracks were damaged too by mounting competition 
from other forms of gambling, such as lotteries and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 When revenues decline, it is hard for the racing industry to act like other 
businesses and cut costs in order to survive. Racetrack plants are large and 
expensive to maintain; so too are their racing surfaces. And horses have to eat 
the same amount whether business is good or bad. So as Charles Town's business 
worsened over the years, the sport was unprofitable for virtually everybody -- 
horse owners as well as the track's owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The purses were so low, especially in the bottom-level races, that even 
reasonably successful horses couldn't pay their own way. Trainer Lee Couchenour 
said: "I had a $2,500 claimer the other day who lost a race by a neck and 
finished third -- and he earned $200. That's not enough even to pay the vet and 
the blacksmith. Maybe from 1 to 5 percent of the owners made a profit. A lot of 
them were leaving the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Maury Wolff marveled at Charles Town's survival in the face of these 
harsh realities. "Small tracks are usually very important to their 
communities," he said, "and Charles Town was the biggest employer in the 
county. A lot of people were willing to lose money in order to keep the game 
alive. A lot of them loved the sport and didn't want to see the horses go to 
the killers." 
</P>
<P>
 But a business needs more solid props than sentiment in order to survive over 
the long run. What can small tracks do in this grim economic climate? 
</P>
<P>
 Some, including Charles Town, have tried to bolster their business by offering 
simulcasts from major racetracks. The drawback of simulcasting is that 
customers simply shift their available money from the live product to the 
televised races, and the track's bottom line doesn't necessarily improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have expanded their business by exporting their races to an off-track or 
inter-track betting network. Penn National Race Course once seemed to have as 
precarious a future as Charles Town, but Pennsylvania created a statewide 
betting operation that has enabled Penn National to prosper. Charles Town could 
have survived if it had been in Pennsylvania rather than West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility for racetracks is to offer other forms of gambling besides 
horse betting -- just as Hollywood Park has done with its poker club and 
Arlington Park wants to do with an on-track casino. This, of course, was the 
plan of Charles Town's management, which wanted to install video lottery 
terminals (i.e., high-tech slot machines) at the track. When voters rejected 
that proposal, management announced the closing of the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Would slot machines have saved Charles Town? Wolff has studied the issue, and 
he said: "If you have a monopoly on slot machines, you're obviously in a strong 
position. But when you've got one industry trying to prop up the other, you've 
got to ask the question: Why do you need the racetrack?" 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to imagine that, over the long run, horse racing is going to 
survive if it is a money-losing proposition for everybody involved in the game. 
Even if Charles Town had gained permission to install the video-lottery 
terminals, it might only have been postponed the inevitable.

FORCED SALARY CAP COULD MEAN LEGAL LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK MASKE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball's team owners were told by at least one attorney during their meeting 
in Chicago Thursday that their planned implementation of a salary cap system 
probably could not withstand a legal challenge by the Players Association, 
especially if the owners were to take that step immediately, sources close to 
the situation said. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor talks between the owners and on-strike players are scheduled to resume 
Monday morning in Washington, for the owners voted Thursday to postpone 
declaring an impasse in negotiations and unilaterally imposing a salary cap. 
They approved that measure by a 25-3 vote, but acting commissioner Bud Selig 
said implementation will take effect only if there's no breakthrough in 
negotiations with the union by next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides thus have a four-day window of bargaining opportunity next week, 
and they're coming off five days of discussions in Rye Brook, N.Y., where many 
of the principals apparently believed they were making progress -- at one point 
-- toward a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the owners' reasons for delaying implementation for a second time remain a 
topic for debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig and other owners said that implementation is a last resort, and 
negotiations had to be given one more chance. "We decided to just keep trying 
to get an agreement until the calendar dictates that time has run out," Selig, 
the Brewers' owner, said yesterday from his office in Milwaukee. "If the union 
wants an agreement, this gives them another chance to get one." 
</P>
<P>
 But sources indicated that New York Mets chief executive officer Fred Wilpon 
brought a lawyer to the Thursday meeting who warned the owners that 
implementation of a salary cap would be a risky legal move, particularly if it 
were done then (the Mets, the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays were the 
three teams to vote against implementation after a seven-day delay). The union 
would challenge any impasse declaration and implementation with the National 
Labor Relations Board, and the NLRB already has announced its intention to 
issue a complaint against the owners for improperly withholding a $7.8 million 
payment to the players' pension fund in August.If the owners are found to have 
failed to bargain in good faith, the union could seek an injunction to keep a 
salary cap from remaining in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in Thursday's meeting said Friday that several owners argued for 
immediate implementation. Union officials still seem to believe that only a 
surrender on their part on the dispute's central issue -- the owners' 
insistence upon having a salary cap or the taxation-system equivalent of one, 
and the players' resistance to anything like that -- will produce an agreement 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean that the owners' decision to delay implementation 
necessarily was mere posturing for the NLRB, or that talks are doomed to break 
down again. People on both sides say there was genuine progress late Tuesday 
night in Rye Brook on the taxation issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we saw were discussions that were positive and moving," union chief 
Donald Fehr said Friday from New York. "But that was only on one issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The talks broke off Wednesday, when the owners thought the union was going to 
bring them a formal proposal and union officials offered only a series of 
suggestions. But sources say union officials were in contact with members of 
the owners' bargaining committee by telephone Wednesday night -- after the 
owners had traveled to Chicago -- to try to clear up the misunderstanding. On 
Thursday, the negotiating committee recommended the delay in implementation to 
the rest of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr was noncommittal Friday as to whether the union will have a new proposal 
to present Monday, saying: "I don't know how things will develop on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Rockies Chairman Jerry McMorris, who had indicated he'd been 
optimistic Tuesday night that a deal was within reach, said following the 
owners' meeting that he remains hopeful of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get this behind us," McMorris said. "We want baseball to be played 
next season. . . . Nobody wants (a legal battle). That's not what we got into 
baseball for." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners, according to people in the meeting, also were told Thursday that 
the combined debt of the 28 major league teams is approximately $600 million -- 
or an average of over $21 million per club. About 20 percent of that debt is 
from teams borrowing from baseball's central line of credit, the owners were 
told. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia Phillies owner Bill Giles Friday would not confirm any specific 
numbers, but said the amount of money the clubs have borrowed from the central 
line of credit is "by far the largest number we've ever had in baseball."

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE CUTTING EDGE: SPECIAL REPORT; TAX PROPOSAL SEEKS TO MEET 
THE FUTURE BY DEGREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Flanigan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The information age came to tax policy Thursday night, as President Clinton 
called for tax-deductible tuition for college, vocational and graduate school 
and for grants to individual Americans to help them retrain and cope with 
constantly changing job markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was generous -- up to $10,000 tax-deductible tuition and $2,000 
tax-deferred individual retirement accounts that could be used to pay for 
education, among other items. Whether it can be squared with budget limitations 
or a Republican Congress remains a question for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the emphasis on schooling was significant. Clinton was responding to the 
fears of many Americans, including those of Labor Secretary Robert Reich, that 
the coming of "information industry" will divide workers between the high-tech 
plutocrats and low-skill proletarians. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich voiced such fears in a recent speech: "We are on the way to becoming a 
two-tiered society composed of a few winners and a larger group left behind," 
he told a Democratic party group. One reason, he said, was "technology -- 
largely computer based -- which has either eradicated or devalued every routine 
job which can be done by a software program and simultaneously enriched every 
job utilizing the problem-solving skills of human brains." 
</P>
<P>
 The rhetoric, voiced soon after the Democrats' mid-term election defeats, was 
a bit emotional and misguided. Software programs have created and enriched more 
jobs for clerical workers than for executives -- including many of the 5 
million new jobs opened in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, perhaps 60% of all 120 million U.S. workers today are in an 
information industry, says Robert Kling, a professor of computer science at UC 
Irvine. That's another way of saying that crops are planted, cars are built, 
bank deposits accepted, movies made and tickets dispensed with computerized 
machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 And the people doing that computerized work range from messengers and office 
helpers to architects and neurosurgeons. The U.S. work force, more than any 
other, has become adept at using computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Clinton and Reich are correct in addressing fears and prescribing 
education -- or more inclusively life-long learning -- as the antidote for 
those fears. Because the prospects for technological change are sobering. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutting edge today among computer experts is electronic commerce, or the 
prospect of vastly expanded business on the Internet. The Internet is a 
federation of 3.2 million computers in 48,000 networks around the world. It was 
developed by the Pentagon and U.S. universities in the 1970s as a 
communications network without a center (which could have been vulnerable to 
attack) and theoretically without limits, like the universe itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet long ago outgrew government uses and now is expected to link 100 
million computers in millions of local networks within the next five years. It 
is becoming literally a global marketplace in which companies are displaying 
entire product lines for industrial customers who may log on from anywhere. 
Cost of display is extremely low -- General Electric put 1,500 pages of its 
plastics division's specifications on the Net. 
</P>
<P>
 And the costs of transacting business can be cut more than 50% just because a 
lot of middlemen are eliminated. Such a powerful cost-reduction tool is at 
least as significant as the Interstate Highway System begun in the 1950s, which 
has changed the face of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of change on such a scale is unpredictable. The interstate system 
hurt small towns it bypassed, but it greatly expanded the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 And, important for individuals coping with change, the interstate highway 
system developed gradually, and so will the electronic highway -- on which 
commercial traffic is still surprisingly light. Forrester Research, a San 
Francisco firm, estimates that commerce on the Internet will grow to $5 billion 
by 1998. That's less business than will be done in America's shopping malls 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 So in thinking about technology, don't be frightened by big words. Just look 
at what information industry really is. Federal Express, the package courier, 
started out by giving customers small computer terminals for tracking packages 
-- the ones it features in TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Now FedEx is giving customers diskettes they can use with any computer. And on 
the diskette along with package tracking are individual customer lists and 
capabilities for printing waybills and shipping labels. FedEx is using 
information to help its customers' business and so boost its own, creating jobs 
both at home and overseas.  
</P>
<P>
 But the computer's effect on jobs is clearer up close. Barbara Parkman of 
Milwaukee is starting a business on her own, searching the Internet for clients 
too busy to sit for hours trying to isolate useful items from oceans of 
information -- GE's 1,500 pages, for example. Parkman's "job" is electronic 
librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet more important than her computer skills for that business is the basic 
education she received at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, which 
trained her ability to analyze information and make discriminating choices. 
</P>
<P>
 And note, she didn't have to take a degree in library science or cope with a 
big company's employment practices. She's in business for herself. The world to 
come, in which information will be inexpensively available to all, inevitably 
will be more democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us back to Clinton's proposed deductions for education: Will they 
really spur people to develop their knowledge and productivity? "Or will they 
become yet another entitlement?" asks Michael Duffy, who teaches tax policy at 
USC's graduate Business School. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's proposals were greeted with immediate criticism: that tax breaks for 
schooling and families reach only a "minority" of the population today, 
although deductions and grants for education apparently would be available to 
everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject is worthy of debate. And Clinton himself referred to his model in 
the post-World War II GI Bill of Rights, which also reached a small minority 
but had a profound effect on the nation and its economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The GI Bill, between 1944 and '54, gave higher education to many who never 
would have had it, and therefore helped in the expansion of U.S. universities, 
which became a foundation for U.S. discoveries in computing and the growth of 
its advanced industries. 
</P>
<P>
 This seems a more fearful and myopic time. But if Congress could re-create a 
GI Bill, we might see again that the economic benefits a country reaps from 
cultivating the minds of its citizens are unpredictable, but also unlimited -- 
like the universe, or the Internet.

THE CUTTING EDGE: SPECIAL REPORT; REALITY CHECK; IN '95, TECHNOLOGIES WILL 
THRIVE ON PROFITS -- NOT PROMISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Computer and communications technologies have been changing our world for 
decades, but it was not until the 1990s -- when the power of the computer chip 
reached a certain critical mass and communications networks began talking the 
language of computers -- that the cataclysmic implications of those changes 
started to become clear. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1993, sane, rational people were talking of services that fused the two 
technologies, as in video on demand, long-distance learning, "tele-medicine" 
and "anywhere, any time" communications. 
</P>
<P>
 And if 1993 was the year technology entered our collective consciousness, 1994 
was the year of Infobahn euphoria. Politicians, businessmen, news reporters and 
would-be multimedia producers vied to see whose "information superhighway" 
metaphors stretched furthest as they predicted vast social change and digital 
nirvana just around the bend. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, however, the cognoscenti were cynically referring to 
the "super-hypeway," and it was becoming obvious that many of the promises had 
been off by years. Mergers between cable and phone companies that were supposed 
to have helped to open the new age quickly came apart. Interactive television 
trials were delayed. Congress did not pass a telecommunications deregulation 
bill as expected. Personal computers flew off the store shelves, but consumers 
found themselves with a Pentium chip bug. 
</P>
<P>
 So what of 1995? Call it the Year of the Reality Check. Next year will be the 
year the information wheat is separated from the digital chaff; it will be the 
year in which technology trials and pilot marketing efforts finally begin to 
generate information. Instead of just talking a good game, companies will have 
to lay down money and make hard decisions about which technologies they should 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most critical decisions will involve the vision of an interactive, 
500-channel television service. Cable and telephone companies had been taking a 
"Field of Dreams" if-we-build-it-they-will-come approach. Just install the 
broad-band networks required to send video signals, they suggested, and a host 
of new businesses will flock to exploit it. Some called it the big bang 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Better to call it the big bungle. Once it became clear that 
$1,000-per-household estimates for the new networks were on the low side, 
aggressive rollout plans were rolled back. Look for further trials instead. 
Time Warner, which was scheduled to begin offering services to 4,000 homes in 
Orlando, Fla., by early 1994, finally got its trial under way this month after 
endless technical problems. Pacific Bell, which said last year it would wire 
1.5 million homes by the end of 1996, now says it will have only about 600,000 
homes "passed" by then. And even those plans seem fraught with uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technical hurdles are more daunting than the early visionaries had 
expected," said Gary Smaby, a technology consultant. "A lot of this technology 
has never been tested outside the laboratory." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, trial marketing will provide information that can guide future 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trials will weed out some bad ideas," said Greg E. Blonder, chief 
technical officer of AT&T's corporate strategy division. "Consumers know when 
something is bad. They don't know if they like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders expect a lukewarm response, which would result in a go-slow 
approach to building new broad-band networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've stood in front of a Blockbuster store for an hour and watched people go 
in and out," said James Cannavino, senior vice president for strategy and 
development at IBM. "They all go to different aisles and come back with four or 
five tapes." After discussion, he says, the typical family narrows down the 
selection of tapes and leaves, stopping by for fast food on the way home. "We 
can't do that yet." 
</P>
<P>
 A slower approach to infrastructure investments will give would-be interactive 
TV firms more time to make decisions about a key missing part of the proposed 
services: the set-top box. These devices will convert digital signals into 
forms that can be viewed on a television set, manage the on-screen "menus" that 
will give viewers control over the systems and send back the signals that will 
make the TV "interactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the reaction to next year's trials, these machines could be 
souped-up cable TV boxes or they could be powerful machines that can perform 
simultaneously as game machines, shopping terminals and video telephones. 
Computer makers such as Silicon Graphics are competing with General Instruments 
and other vendors of conventional cable TV equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the major networks have been loath to commit themselves. "Set-top 
boxes get twice as good every year," said Cannavino of IBM. "Making decisions 
too early makes them obsolete." 
</P>
<P>
 That's frustrating for the equipment suppliers, but cable industry executives 
grumble in private that when it comes to the boxes, the equipment suppliers 
have promised the world and not delivered. And, many in the PC industry now say 
it is the personal computer that will pave the interactive path into the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one of the most notable developments of 1994 was explosive growth in 
two related areas: the consumer PC business and on-line communications 
services. Commercial services such as Prodigy and America Online, along with 
the network of networks known as the Internet, have emerged as popular 
precursors to the more elaborate broad-band networks planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, cable companies are rushing to install technologies that will enable 
them to offer Internet "channels" and high access to commercial on-line 
services. Intel and other companies, for their part, are racing to market with 
"cable modems" that will, in 1995, allow many PC users to tap into the 
high-capacity communications capabilities of their cable TV wires. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're seeing an example of a concept that has caught fire," said William 
Savoy, president at Vulcan Ventures, the investment company for billionaire 
Paul Allen, which recently cashed in an investment in America Online for a big 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more transactions are going to be conducted on line," Savoy said. 
There will be virtual electronic marketplaces. We are still early in the cycle, 
but it's clearly cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 But the growth of these services will be governed by their potential to make 
money. What that means, in turn, is that many of the technologies so heavily 
hyped to consumers in 1994 will begin to find niches in 1995 -- in the business 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic commerce provides a useful example. There has been a lot of talk 
about on-line shopping networks, with everyone from IBM to MCI and AT&T 
experimenting in the arena. But public networks lack security, and there are 
still few areas where shopping by computer is quicker or cheaper than, say, 
using a catalogue and calling a mail-order 800 phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 The real action is in the business market, where factories are connecting with 
their suppliers and customers to speed up orders and deliveries and to keep 
inventories down -- which can produce immediate savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the wireless gizmos known as personal digital assistants may have 
been marketed first as the wave of the future, but they're likely to retreat 
for the moment into specialized markets. Brian Sroub, vice president of 
personal information systems at Sony Corp., knows the score. He saw the Newton, 
over-hyped by former Apple Chairman John Scully as an all-purpose 
communications device, flayed for falling far short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make sure we don't get too far ahead of the consumer," Sroub said. 
</P>

 Sony's Newton-like device is being sold primarily as a way to collect and send 
e-mail. The machine uses Magic Cap, an operating system trumpeted for its 
capability to send out packets of software instructions, or "intelligent 
agents" that go out into the network on their own to make travel arrangements 
or reserve tickets to see Madonna.

 But don't try that trick just yet or you'll miss the concert. "We see volume

 A technology not driven by business applications must have new mechanisms that 
make it profitable. Sometimes that direction comes from competition. Cable 
companies are feeling pressure from satellite broadcasters that offer 150 
channels to people who pay $600 to $700 for a satellite receiver. While the 
competition may be unwelcome, their success suggests that customers will pay 
heavily for quality services. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's just a new twist on an old idea. In the world of wireless 
communications, the bidding for wireless licenses will be completed in 1995. 
Companies will begin drawing up concrete plans for their services -- and the 
early focus will be on the tried-and-true cellular phones and paging.

all part of the steady advancement of technology.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: REPUBLICAN SWEEP, CLINTON'S CHANGE OF HEART MAY AID 
THE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. BOSKIN, former chairman of the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers, is Tully M. Friedman professor of economics and senior fellow, Hoover 
Institution, at Stanford University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's economy continues its modest recovery. At 7.7%, the unemployment 
rate is down from over 9% a few months ago, but still well above the national 
average. Most other indicators of economic activity are up. 
</P>
<P>
 The forces and trends that shape the state's economy are first and foremost 
the activities of the private sector -- in California, the rest of the country 
and around the world. These forces are affected only somewhat by state and 
federal economic policies -- or even by local government developments on the 
scale of Orange County's bankruptcy. So, much of California's future depends on 
its entrepreneurs and workers seizing opportunities to create new industries 
and expand existing ones, thereby creating more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, state and federal policies do matter. And the direction of state and 
federal policies will reflect the electoral tsunami of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the Republicans obtain majorities in the House and Senate and a 
majority of the governorships, but not a single incumbent Republican lost a bid 
for reelection -- no senator, representative or governor. The election first 
and foremost was a rejection of the overreaching of government on many fronts. 
Taxes are too high; the government spends too much, and inefficiently; the 
government regulates too much, generating so much red tape and bureaucracy that 
it stifles business starts and expansions, and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously in this column, I've focused on four of President Clinton's 
policies and proposals that are, or would be, damaging to California's economy. 
Fortunately, the new Congress is likely to reject some and end others. In fact, 
Clinton is starting to run back toward the political center as fast as he can. 
</P>
<P>
 First among the problems besetting the California economy: huge defense cuts 
-- and the prospect of even larger cuts in the future. Over half of the jobs 
lost in the California recession are defense-related. The Republicans' 
"Contract With America" calls for increases in defense spending. The 
Republicans may or may not be able to accomplish that, but at least they will 
stop the additional dramatic reduction Clinton has proposed. A couple of weeks 
ago, even the President called for a $25-billion increase in defense spending 
-- although most of that is in the distant future. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, health care reform. The new Congress will consider incremental reform 
to improve portability of benefits and access to health care and to deal with 
pre-existing conditions. But the radical government takeover of health care and 
its financing envisioned by Clinton is dead.  
</P>
<P>
 Third, taxes. There will be no more tax increases. The House Republicans 
pledged several tax cuts, and the President last week revived his campaign 
pledge of a middle-class tax cut. Hopefully, the growth of entitlement spending 
will be slowed and ineffective programs eliminated, so that, combined with the 
economic growth from lower taxes, tax rates can be cut without worsening the 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats call these proposals a return to Reaganomics, dismissing the latter 
as a deficit-deepening failure. The longest peacetime expansion in American 
history, 1982-1990, is more than sufficient to dismiss that charge. But 
government spending went up, not down, during that period. This time, there is 
more of a consensus for eliminating programs and reducing spending. Witness the 
defeats of House Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.) and would-have-been Democratic 
Senate Leader Jim Sasser of Tennessee, who ran in part on their power to bring 
home the bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth issue I wrote about before the election was illegal immigration. 
This subject is enormously emotive -- as has been highlighted by the passage of 
Proposition 187, which, if enforced, would cut off some state services to 
illegal immigrants. Whatever one believes about the propriety of Prop. 187, 
controlling the borders is a federal -- not state -- responsibility. And if the 
federal government is not going to make a serious effort to reduce the massive 
inflow of illegal immigrants, it should either pay for the services it mandates 
the state provide or relieve the state of the mandate.  
</P>
<P>
 Expect the new Congress to propose giving the states more block grants and 
greater flexibility to attempt reforms in various programs, such as welfare. 
Gov. Pete Wilson has indicated a great desire to do so -- and to end the red 
tape and stonewalling involved in getting waivers from federal requirements for 
these programs, as well as the endless appeals through the judicial system 
necessary to implement legislation. (More on state policy and the economy in my 
next column.) 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, the change in control of Congress, Wilson's reelection by the 
largest plurality in 20 years and the apparent move toward the center by the 
President suggest that many of the federal policies that have contributed to 
California's economic woes will be changed. Congress will prevent the 
imposition of new unfunded mandates on the states. There will be no more tax 
hikes. The defense slowdown will be arrested, perhaps even partially reversed. 
And if health care reform is passed, it will be far less intrusive 
economically.  
</P>
<P>
 All this potentially adds up to a big plus for California.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: '94 WASN'T A GOOD YEAR, BUT INVESTORS STAYED ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, A financial writer for the Arizona Republic, specializes in 
mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without question, 1994 has been a disappointing year for the mutual fund 
industry and its estimated 40 million investors, but it could have been much 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, the fund concept remains alive and well. Investors continue to 
demonstrate their faith by holding more than $2 trillion in mutual funds. And 
banks and insurance companies continue to demonstrate their faith by acquiring 
fund companies as soon as they put themselves on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
 These votes of confidence come despite numerous small embarrassments that 
could have damaged the fund industry in 1994 but didn't.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the setbacks, a small Denver money market fund stumbled to below the 
standard price of $1 a share -- the first time such a fund had done so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breaking a buck" has been a major worry of industry executives for years, 
because money market portfolios are the safest places for fund shareholders to 
go when the stock and bond markets are heading south, yet these portfolios are 
not federally insured the way bank accounts are. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives were blamed for the 6-cents-a-share loss sustained by the 
Community Bankers U.S. Government Money Market Fund of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout was limited, though, because the portfolio, which eventually 
closed, served mostly institutional shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there's a good chance at least one such portfolio will drop 
below $1 a share because of the Orange County bankruptcy filing, predicts 
IBC/Donoghue, an investment advisory firm in Ashland, Mass. That could produce 
a more serious ripple effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps fortuitously, only about 27% of mutual fund assets today are in money 
market portfolios, down from 77% in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Another worrisome development occurred in January, when a prominent portfolio 
manager was forced out for ethical reasons. John Kaweske had been the star at 
the Invesco Funds Group in Denver before being fired for failing to report and 
gain approval for personal trades. 
</P>
<P>
 The implication was that Kaweske could have bought stocks before his funds did 
-- a practice known as front-running. The Investment Company Institute, the 
Washington-based trade organization for the fund industry, later issued a 
tough, albeit voluntary, set of personal-investment guidelines for fund 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the nation's largest fund group, Fidelity Investments of Boston, had an 
embarrassing moment in 1994. For one day in June, Fidelity knowingly reported 
incorrect prices to newspapers for most of its stock and bond funds, an 
incident that suggested that many fund groups may be making similar "mistakes" 
now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity said all investor transactions made that day were priced correctly. 
Still, the industry prides itself on accurate daily pricing, so the incident 
was a stumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the already-weak bond market was shaken by derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the sharp interest rate increases engineered by the Federal Reserve 
Board, bonds are headed for an unusually bad finish in 1994. The average 
taxable bond fund was down 3.9% for the year through Dec. 2, reports 
IBC/Donoghue, and the average municipal portfolio was off 6.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County bankruptcy filing the week after did not help matters, 
especially among California muni bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the year's biggest losses will be posted by a small number of nationally 
diverse bond funds whose managers speculated with leveraged derivatives. Five 
such portfolios are likely to suffer setbacks of about 25% or more this year, 
say the numbers crunched by Lipper Analytical Services of Summit, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders can't really blame their bond fund managers for losses 
attributable to fluctuating interest rates, which are hard to predict -- but 
they're fit to be tied when derivatives make the red ink spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, amid these and other setbacks, most fund investors appear to have 
stayed the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Total fund assets in October, the most recent month for which information is 
available, came to a record $2.2 trillion. The Investment Company Institute 
estimates that a record 40 million people have a record 100 million shareholder 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that sales of bond funds have been weak in 1994, though not 
drastically so, and sales of stock portfolios have been modestly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The only explanation for this continuing confidence during a tough year is 
that most shareholders apparently realize that mutual funds still make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds remain the easiest, most efficient and convenient way to invest. Low 
minimum purchases, widespread diversification, switching privileges, quick and 
simple access to foreign markets, automatic dividend reinvestment, monthly 
dividends on bond funds, professional management -- these are among the many 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 And even with this year's mini scandals, there has been little talk of 
malicious wrongdoing. The many checks and balances in the business -- including 
the oversight of fund assets by independent custodian banks -- greatly limit 
the possibilities for outright theft. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, mutual funds work, and they will continue to grow in popularity and 
importance in the years -- presumably better years -- ahead. 
</P>
<P>

 If it seems as if the stock market has been kicking up its heels lately, it 
might have something to do with the seasons. December is the third-best month 
for large stocks, posting an average return of 1.71%, says Ibbotson Associates 
of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer months of July and August tend to be best of all, with average 
gains of 2.11% and 1.86%, respectively. After third-place December comes 
January (up 1.58), June (up 1.31), April (up 1.30), November (up 1.29), 
February (up 0.59), May (up 0.48), March (up 0.44) and October (up 0.13). The 
worst, and only negative, month is September, off 0.97% on average. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibbotson's figures track the monthly performance of the large-stock Standard & 
Poor's 500 from 1926 through 1993.

 The first open-end mutual fund to focus on South Korean stocks will start 
accepting investments Jan. 2. The 5%-load Matthews Korea Fund ($5,000 minimum; 
(800) 789-ASIA) is a collaboration between Daewoo Capital Management of Seoul 
and Matthews International Capital Management of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean government has gradually increased the allowable foreign ownership 
of Korean companies to the current 12.5%, says Paul Matthews, whose company is 
a relative newcomer to mutual funds but is managing $180 million in investment 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Korean economy has grown faster than any other Asian economy except for 
China's over the past 10 years," says Matthews, who forecasts 8% real growth 
for 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet the value of the nation's stocks relative to the size of the economy is 
considerably lower than in the three other "tiger" states of Taiwan, Hong Kong 
and Singapore, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contradicting some earlier surveys, a study conducted for the Consumer Bankers 
Assn. suggests that most investors do understand that mutual funds sold at 
banks are not protected by federal insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about one in five household decision makers believes that funds purchased 
at a bank are insured, says Joe Belew, president of the Arlington, Va., group. 
The survey provides evidence that banks have been complying with guidelines 
designed to ensure that customers understand the risks associated with mutual 
funds, Belew says.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: THE RIGHT WAY TO DRAW ON AN IRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I turned 70 1/2 in October and must begin making mandatory withdrawals from 
my individual retirement accounts. I have a total of about $500,000 in all my 
accounts. I think my minimum required distribution is $20,805. I have been 
taking out the interest and dividends generated by my IRA investments each 
year, a total of about $27,300. Am I meeting the federal requirements? No one 
gives me a straight answer. -- F.B . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. The easiest way to calculate your required annual minimum withdrawal is to 
use the "term certain method," which is based on your life expectancy and, if 
you want, the life expectancy of your IRA beneficiary. Under this method, you 
would calculate the annual withdrawal each year by dividing your account 
balance by your life expectancy, as determined by IRS actuarial tables. These 
tables are detailed in IRS Publication No. 939, Pension General Rules. To 
order, call (800) 829-3676. 
</P>
<P>
 We asked Palm Springs certified public accountant Howard Gordon to calculate 
your minimum required annual withdrawal for 1994 using your life expectancy 
only. The result: about $32,680. (It would be less if you were to add in the 
life expectancy of your IRA beneficiary.) Where and How to Buy T-Bonds, T-Bills 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Where can I purchase Treasury securities? With rates increasing, these 
investments are looking more attractive every day. -- M .A . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. You're absolutely right that the recent spike in interest rates is 
generating interest in government notes. Treasury bonds can be purchased 
through banks and securities brokers, but you will probably be charged a sales 
fee of as much as $25 per bond. However, you can also buy bonds directly from 
the U.S. government and pay no fee at all. 
</P>
<P>
 First, here is your range of purchase choices. Treasury bonds, which range in 
maturity from two years to 30 years, are available in $1,000 increments up to a 
maximum of $5 million. Treasury notes are sold in two- and five-year maturities 
and are available in $1,000 increments from a minimum of $5,000 to a maximum of 
$5 million. Treasury bills, or T-bills as they are often called, are sold in 
six- and 12-month maturities and are available in $1,000 increments from a 
minimum of $10,000 to a maximum of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bonds and notes may be purchased directly from the Federal Reserve 
Bank. In Los Angeles, the Fed is located at 950 S. Grand Ave. You may also buy 
them by mail by writing the Bureau of Public Debt, Washington, DC 20239. 
Personal checks are accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 T-bills are also available by mail, but the process is a bit more complicated. 
Your first step should be to open an account with the Fed. You can do this by 
writing to the Fed at P.O. Box 2077, Terminal Annex, Los Angeles, CA 90051 and 
asking for a New Account Request form. Complete it and return it. Soon you will 
receive a note that your account has been opened. Then, you can simply send a 
cashier's check to the Fed in the amount of the bill you wish to purchase. 
Include a note stating the type of security you want to buy and your account 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 As you may know, Treasury bills are sold at discount, with the discount rate 
corresponding to the interest rate carried by the bill. Buyers should send 
checks for the full amount of the bill. Reimbursements for the discount are 
returned to the buyer by mail or direct deposit into a bank account designated 
by the buyer shortly after the auction. To Avoid Taxes on a Home Sale, Buy 
Equal 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am planning to marry soon. My fiance and I have each sold a home that we 
had owned. We plan to use the proceeds to purchase a new home together. My home 
sold for $120,000; hers sold for $180,000. The home we want to buy costs 
$183,000. We are applying our profits (mine were $3,000; hers were $15,000) to 
the new home and purchasing one that is more expensive than those we sold. Are 
we doing the right thing to avoid taxes? -- A.G . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. To avoid taxation on any profits you realized from the sale of your 
respective homes, the two of you must purchase a replacement home equal to the 
combined total of the two sales prices. This means your replacement home must 
cost at least $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are unable or unwilling to make such a purchase, you face a tax 
liability on your gains. One possible way to minimize the tax bite is to put 
the replacement home in the name of your wife. This will allow her to shelter 
her gain of $15,000 and expose you to taxation on just $3,000. $125,000 
Exclusion Can Apply Interstate 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My husband and I have owned a home in another state since 1964. He lives 
there; I live in California since being transferred here in 1986. My husband 
will soon reach age 55. May he sell his residence and take the $125,000 
exclusion and relocate to California to live with me? -- M.B . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Assuming the out-of-state home is truly your husband's principal residence, 
your plan should work. One way to verify that the out-of-state home is really 
your husband's principal residence is whether he files his income tax from that 
location. He should, to pass muster.

THE CUTTING EDGE: SPECIAL REPORT / HOT TIPS; WHAT'S COMING, WHEN, AND WHY IT'S 
A BIG DEAL; NEXT YEAR COULD BRING START OF ON-LINE PROFITS 
</P>

 If 1993 was the year businesses figured out what the Internet was and 1994 the 
year they learned how to use it, 1995 will be the year corporations actually 
make some money on the global computer network. With the emphasis on some . 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic commerce -- currently crude and not yet secure -- will come of age 
next year as entrepreneurial firms such as Vienna, Va.-based Cybercash and 
Mountain View-based Netscape Communications team up with banking heavyweights 
the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America to ensure secure transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 By early in the first quarter of '95, analysts expect consumers will be able 
to make purchases over the network without exposing their credit card numbers 
-- a turning point in the evolution of the Internet that will lead to perhaps 
30,000 electronic "storefronts" opening by year's end -- a tenfold increase 
over the current number. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of traffic over the World Wide Web portion of the Internet, which 
allows for graphics display and audio, is expected to catch up with and exceed 
fax traffic in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, federal law enforcement officials are getting ready for a 
wave of digital terrorism far more sophisticated than anything the teen-age 
"hacker" has wrought, as corporations and whole nations begin to engage in 
on-line espionage. 
</P>
<P>
 With the added capability of digital cash and credit transactions, the 
Internet increasingly will compete with major commercial on-line services, 
which will be forced to lower prices and reorient their core businesses. 
Experts differ, however, as to just how they will be reshaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Most look for increasing integration of the services into the Internet itself 
and, via new cable modems that will be available to consumers beginning next 
year, over the cable network. The commercial services together have about 5 
million subscribers now; by the end of next year several forecasts have that 
number more than doubling. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest, Prodigy Services Co. with 2.3 million members, has made the 
deepest forays into the cable industry and is expected to offer its service 
over several systems in 1995. America Online, the fastest-growing service, aims 
to leverage its experience with the less technically literate consumer to 
reposition itself as a friendly Internet access provider and a packager of 
on-line entertainment and information. 
</P>
<P>
 All the major services will come out with new user interfaces, which will 
likely incorporate the language of the World Wide Web -- an acknowledgment that 
they must be compatible with the broader Internet, whose user base is expected 
to reach 45 million, in order to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some analysts say, that will not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1995 we'll see the death knell of commercial services like CompuServe," 
said Michael Strangelove, publisher of the Internet Business Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's sally into the on-line services business will dramatically affect 
the year for everyone else. The Microsoft Network, packaged with a new version 
of Windows, is expected to wreak havoc with the structure of the on-line 
services industry. But most do not expect to see it until late in 1995. 
Interchange, the on-line service developed by Ziff-Davis before it was sold, 
may or may not materialize, depending on whether it finds a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 And the degree to which business prospers on-line anywhere ultimately will 
depend on the quality of the goods offered -- and their presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, young techies may be the only ones spending their money on 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Bruce Ryon, an analyst with the San Jose-based consulting firm Dataquest: 
"The Internet will be a great way to sell in 1995 -- to college kids, mostly."

THE CUTTING EDGE: SPECIAL REPORT / HOT TIPS; WHAT'S COMING, WHEN, AND WHY IT'S 
A BIG DEAL; IMPENDING WINDOWS95 MAY BE YEAR'S MAIN EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It may be late for an important date, but Microsoft's eagerly awaited 
Windows95 will nonetheless be the computer industry's main event next year, say 
the pundits who track the nation's silicon glens and valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 And assuming that Intel can quickly squash its floating-point bug and quash 
the attendant controversy, 1995 will also be the year of the Pentium 
microprocessor and its ilk. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be plenty of other developments in the coming year: Will the 
Justice Department buck industry consensus and scuttle the merger of Microsoft 
and Intuit, the champion of personal finance software? If not, will the joined 
companies grab control of the emerging market for on-line transactions, as many 
bankers fear? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Microsoft Network on-line service, due along with Windows95, spell 
doom for rivals such as America Online and Prodigy, and bolster what some 
increasingly view as Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates' stranglehold on the 
computer industry? Will the PowerPC coalition make headway against the 
Microsoft-Intel juggernaut? 
</P>
<P>
 Running through these issues like an out-of-control computer virus is 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, Bill Gates will be all over everything," said William Bluestein, an 
analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, Gates wants his easy-to-use Windows95 operating system to be all over 
the desktop PCs of home and business users. It promises a user "interface" with 
pictures of rooms and objects rather than the usual icons and menu bars, and it 
will come with easy on-line access in the form of Microsoft Network. Microsoft 
says Windows95 will be shipped to stores by June, but don't be surprised if 
it's late again. 
</P>
<P>
 Propelled by Windows95, the Pentium and Pentium-style "clones" from Advanced 
Micro Devices and Cyrix, sales of PCs are expected to show a healthy increase 
next year as prices for big multimedia systems tumble to $1,200 from $1,800 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Projections from Dataquest, a San Jose market research firm, indicate that 
1994 will go down as the year the $35-billion PC industry reached a stunning 
21.2% growth rate. The pace of expansion in 1995, when sales of 20.5 million 
PCs are predicted, will be a still respectable 14.5%, Dataquest said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barring something outside the normal electronic sphere, it sure looks to me 
like it will be another strong year for everybody," said Les Crudele, a vice 
president with Motorola's microprocessor and memory technologies group in 
Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Shaffer, principal of Technologic Partners, a New York-based 
consulting firm, said he expects to see reasonably strong industry expansion 
next year. "A lot depends on the strength of the economy, which looks pretty 
good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, the hot commodity was multimedia, as consumers barreled headlong into 
computing to take advantage of the entertainment and educational opportunities 
afforded by souped-up machines with sound and video. Next year, the home market 
will continue to be a force, and growth will also come from the transition of 
office systems to the Pentium chip -- though what effect the recent brouhaha 
over a bug will have on Pentium sales remains something of a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also be a critical year for IBM, whose OS/2 Warp will either become a 
true Windows rival or head toward extinction. IBM will also bring out its first 
PCs based on the PowerPC architecture developed with Apple. A few clones of the 
Apple PowerMac may also emerge late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, global commerce should create boundless opportunities. Central and 
South America, China and Africa represent vast, untapped markets for computers 
and telecommunications gear. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to be selling this stuff in every nook and cranny of the 
world," said Roger B. McNamee, general partner with Integral Capital Partners, 
a Menlo Park, Calif., group that invests in technology companies. "By the end 
of the year, things will be smoking."

THE CUTTING EDGE: SPECIAL REPORT / HOT TIPS; WHAT'S COMING, WHEN, AND WHY IT'S 
A BIG DEAL; NATION WILL GET WIRED, BUT NOT ALL WILL BENEFIT 
</P>

<P>
 Though Congress failed to rewrite the nation's telecommunications laws this 
year to spur competition, private industry efforts to wire the nation for 
interactive TV, electronic home shopping and other advanced communications 
services will likely intensify in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The improving economy, cheaper communications technology, phenomenal growth in 
computer on-line information services and aggressive state deregulation of the 
telephone industry are combining to revive industry interest in modernizing the 
nation's communications network for the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
 The progress, however, will still be slower than many of the 
info-superhighway-is-at-hand advertisements suggest. Only wealthy, relatively 
urban areas where it is most cost-effective to string high-capacity 
communications wires will see the deployment of the newest communications 
technologies, such as digital phone lines and interactive cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone now recognizes that the superhighway is coming, but it's 
coming slowly," said Richard Cotton, general counsel for NBC. "Certainly, all 
the major networks and video programmers in general recognize that change is 
coming and that anyone who stands still does not have a bright future." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the flashiest components of the emerging network was launched last week 
when entertainment giant Time Warner Inc. hooked up a dozen families to the 
nation's most ambitious interactive TV system. The company plans to expand the 
system -- which features movies on demand, interactive video games and home 
shopping -- to serve as many as 4,000 Orlando, Fla., homes by the end of next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 By midyear, an industry consortium will have completed final testing of 
high-definition television and will be submitting their recommendations to 
federal officials for final approval of the technology, which offers compact 
disc-quality sound and movie theater-quality images. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission recently gave phone companies 
permission to build networks to compete with cable TV. The Justice Department 
is considering recommending that a regional Bell telephone company be allowed 
to enter the long-distance business for the first time since a federal judge 
ordered the breakup of the Bell telephone monopoly a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And an enormous amount of activity will continue to take place on the state 
level, where authorities are overhauling telecom regulations to spur 
competition. California, long a laggard in this regard, will launch a broad 
reform proceeding this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics on the federal level are uncertain. Congress, in September, 
pulled the plug on a landmark telecommunications measure that would have 
allowed long-distance carriers, cable operators and local phone companies into 
one another's markets. The move followed bickering between long-distance 
carriers and the Baby Bells over the timing of full competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many of the House and Senate leaders who helped spearhead 
telecommunications reform were ousted in November's Republican election sweep, 
many Republican leaders, such as U.S. Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.), the 
incoming chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, promise quick action on 
telecom reform in 1995.

THE CUTTING EDGE: SPECIAL REPORT / HOT TIPS; WHAT'S COMING, WHEN, AND WHY IT'S 
A BIG DEAL; THE BETTING CONTINUES ON WIRELESS REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wireless communications arena, the big news of 1994 was the 
government's auction of airwaves in July, in which some of the biggest names in 
technology bet billions of dollars that a booming mass market in wireless will 
soon emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 And the big news of 1995 -- at least the first month of it -- will involve 
another, similar auction, this one for licenses even more valuable than those 
sold in July. Winners in the current auction of licenses for so-called 
broad-band personal communications services will probably be announced in 
January, and the victors are expected to pay the government as much as $10 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't hold your breath waiting for the services that will emerge from this 
auction frenzy. While interactive video and data service (IVDS), personal 
communications services (PCS) and a new type of cable service called local 
multipoint distribution service (LMDS) all got the green light in 1994, it will 
cost billions of dollars and take several years for companies to build the 
necessary facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Providers will spend 1995 running a regulatory gantlet that will include 
obtaining final licensing approval from the Federal Communications Commission, 
getting tower construction permits from City Hall and even securing the 
blessings of rival utility companies that may own the rights of way where 
wireless providers have to string cable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not expect major developments next year," said Bob Foosaner, a senior 
vice president at Nextel Communications Inc., a Rutherford, N.J., company that 
operates a wireless mobile radio service that competes with cellular telephone 
service in Los Angeles and several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the latest and greatest in wireless communications won't be quite 
ready yet, those who sell cellular telephone and paging services with today's 
technology should continue to do a land-office business. Cellular phone 
companies have been adding 1,000 customers a day as the increasingly mobile and 
computerized American work force demands always-in-touch communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular services face a big challenge from the new wireless entrants because 
analog cellular providers now are short on capacity and do not have the 
flexibility to carry voice, data and other communications simultaneously in a 
single device. Cellular carriers are scrambling to deploy digital networks that 
will enable them to offer similar capabilities.  
</P>
<P>
 All of this -- implementing new services and upgrading old -- represents a 
rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a major new industry, but it 
also promises to be frightfully expensive. So all the big phone companies are 
involved, along with the cable companies and many others, but alliances are the 
order of the day. Look for many more in 1995.

<P>
 What: Cellular phones

THE CUTTING EDGE: SPECIAL REPORT / HOT TIPS; WHAT'S COMING, WHEN, AND WHY IT'S 
A BIG DEAL; DIZZYING ARRAY OF NEW VIDEO GAME PLAYERS DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Video game buffs who want better, faster, higher-resolution play with cooler 
graphics will be able to buy machines that offer all that and more in 1995, a 
year that's shaping up as an exciting but tumultuous watershed for the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A horde of new game consoles will descend on the market next year, creating 
uncertainty and conceivably slowing overall sales as even the most avid video 
game players falter at the sudden range of options displacing what used to be 
an easy Nintendo-Sega coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Ryon of Dataquest says his prediction for 1995 is that consumers will 
become "very, very confused about what video game player to buy. Sony vs. Atari 
vs. 3DO vs. Nintendo vs. Sega? Sixteen-bit vs. 32-bit vs. 64-bit?" 
</P>
<P>
 The number of American homes with CD-ROM drives in their personal computers is 
expected to more than double next year to 10 million as many consumers opt to 
invest in PC-based game play instead. Quadruple-speed drives, twice as fast as 
those now available, will dominate sales by next spring. As the market reaches 
a critical mass, the price of CD-ROM software will drop, and the budding 
industry may even figure out a way to market its products effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, there will be a massive shake-out of the hundreds of small 
CD-ROM software developers that have sprung up over the last two years. The 
quality of titles will improve as the price of entry climbs closer to the 1994 
record of $5 million spent on producing a CD-ROM game. The much-predicted 
dominance of Microsoft Corp. in games and other home software -- a new area for 
the software giant in 1994 -- will likely come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking it month by month: January will likely bring lower prices for the 
16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, as retailers close 
out what will be the last big Christmas for the 5-year-old machines. 
</P>
<P>
 February and March will see the release of Atari's CD-ROM adapter for its 
64-bit cartridge system currently on the market ($150-$200), and perhaps the 
initial shipments of Sega's Saturn and Sony's Playstation, both 32-bit systems 
favorably received in Japan this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Nintendo promises a semi-portable device called "Virtual Boy," 
complete with goggles. By June, the Saturn and the Playstation (both about 
$350) should be widely available, leaving consumers to ponder whether to buy 
one for the summer months or wait till fall, when Nintendo's "Ultra-64" -- a 
cartridge game machine developed in collaboration with high-end computer 
manufacturer Silicon Graphics -- is due out, with a price tag of about $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer's first consumer entertainment device, a hybrid computer and 
video game console based on a modified version of Motorola's Power PC 
microprocessor, is expected in October or November, as is an advanced version 
of the 3DO console also incorporating the new chip. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a make-or-break year for the upstart 3DO, which has offered 
superior game play at a higher price for the last year. Sales of the machine 
have reached 2 million worldwide after a slow start, but its main advantage -- 
being ahead of the competition -- will disappear next year as deep-pocketed 
rivals enter the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, new ways to play games over telephone and cable lines will bring 
additional competition for game players' attention. The Sega Channel will 
become available in many markets, and Catapult Entertainment's network, which 
allows subscribers to play popular Sega and Nintendo games with each other in 
real time over phone lines, will be rolled out across the country. Fujitsu, 
which purchased on-line game technology developed by George Lucas' firm this 
year, is expected to offer a sort of cyberspace Dungeons & Dragons in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Which of the platforms will emerge victorious will depend largely on what 
games are available to play on them. The year will see several video games 
based on major movies -- and vice-versa, as Hollywood continues to ramp up its 
investment in the game industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite being the first full year of an industry-wide rating system, games 
won't be any less violent -- so look for continued wrangling with Congress and 
consumer groups as interactive software becomes an increasingly greater 
cultural force. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What: Nintendo Ultra-64 
</P>
<P>
 When: Late 1995 
</P>
<P>
 Why it's important: If it costs as little as Nintendo says, the super-fast 
cartridge-based game machine could be a bigger hit than any of its CD-ROM 
competitors.

AIA SELECTS NEW PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chester A. (Chet) Widom, FAIA, a partner of Santa Monica-based Widom Wein 
Cohen, was inaugurated Saturday as the 71st president of the American Institute 
of Architects (AIA). 
</P>
<P>
 Widom, a 1993 AIA vice president, has served as regional director for 
California on the AIA Board of Directors and as president and vice 
president/governmental affairs of the 8,500-member AIA California Council. 
</P>
<P>
 A founding partner of Widom Wein Cohen, a 30-year-old architectural/interior 
design firm with offices in Santa Monica and Mexico City, Widom has been 
responsible for a broad spectrum of design and project management services for 
institutional, high-tech, health care, corporate and government clients 
throughout the western U.S.  
</P>
<P>
 Among projects Widom has overseen are Brandeis-Bardin Institute, Gene Autry 
Western Heritage Museum, Pep Boys corporate headquarters, renovation of Bovard 
Administration Building at USC and the Venice Family Clinic, all in Los 
Angeles; and Kaiser Permanente Data Processing Center in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 Widom is a past two-term president of the Los Angeles Headquarters City Assn.; 
a founder and past president of Alternative Living for the Aging, a nonprofit 
group providing housing alternatives for the elderly; and a member of the L.A. 
Planning Commission Task Force on Design Review Boards.  
</P>
<P>
 A native of Los Angeles, Widom, 55, received his architectural degree from 
USC. He was licensed to practice architecture in 1964. He was named a fellow of 
the AIA in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995 agenda for the 56,000-member professional society, Widom said, 
includes extensive public policy involvement regarding the closure of military 
bases and ascertaining the impact of NAFTA on the architectural profession.

HOT PROPERTY: ACTOR'S ACCENT TO BE ON EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LOUIS JOURDAN, who played the romantic lead in dozens of films including 
"Gigi"(1958) and "Three Coins in the Fountain"(1954), and his wife, Quique, 
have put their Beverly Hills-area home on the market at just under $1.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan to move back to their native France. "They miss Europe," a source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their home was described as "a villa with a magical garden that is 
breathtaking at night, the way it is lit." It has three bedrooms and a maid's 
quarters in 3,000 square feet. Built in the 1960s, the house was remodeled 
after the couple bought it in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor, 78, played a diabolical food critic who poisons a restaurant owner 
on a "Columbo" episode that aired on A&E last March. 
</P>
<P>
 The home is listed with Barbara Duskin of Douglas Properties, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pop singer-songwriter JACKIE DeSHANNON and her husband, film composer RANDY 
EDELMAN, have purchased the Beverly Hills home of producer CAROLE ISENBERG and 
her husband, JERRY, CEO of Hearst Entertainment Productions. The house, once 
listed at $2.35 million, sold for slightly more than $1.7 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Isenberg, associate producer of "The Color Purple" (1985), was 
executive producer of the Emmy-winning miniseries "The Women of Brewster Place" 
(1989), the TV special "Back to School '92" and the film "This Is My Life" 
(1992). 
</P>
<P>
 She is also co-founder of Education First!, which works with entertainment 
industry personalities to increase public awareness about the importance of 
education. Jerry Isenberg is chairman of the Caucus for Producers, Writers and 
Directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Isenbergs, who are moving to their smaller home in Montecito, sold their 
Beverly Hills house because their sons are grown and moved. The Beverly Hills 
house has six bedrooms, maid's quarters, a gym and screening room in nearly 
6,000 square feet. There is also a guest house, which the buyers plan to use as 
a music studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie DeShannon's hits include "What the World Needs Now" (1965), "Put a 
Little Love in Your Heart," which she co-wrote in '69, and "Bette Davis Eyes," 
which she co-wrote in '75. Edelman composed music for such films as "Last of 
the Mohicans," "Twins," "My Cousin Vinny," "Angels in the Outfield" and 
"Gettysburg." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Thompson of Fred Sands' Beverly Hills office represented both sides in 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Singer DIONNE WARWICK'S former Beverly Hills home has been sold for $1.8 
million. The house was on the market in recent years at $6.5 million. Built in 
1931 and later remodeled, the home has five bedrooms in nearly 7,000 square 
feet and a tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick moved out of the house several months ago. It was sold by a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick, who released her 13th album for Arista Records in October with a 
collection of Brazilian songs, has said she plans to keep homes in Brazil and 
Beverly Hills. She was drawn to Brazil, she has said, because it is a place 
where people of African descent are honored.

 The Chess Olympiad ended predictably in Moscow on Thursday with the 
first-seeded Russian team taking the gold medal in the men's competition. 
However, the Russians did not overwhelm the record 122-team field. England held 
a half-point lead with two rounds to go, and only their 1-3 loss to Russia in 
the penultimate round enabled the winners to slip into first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Final scores: Russia-1, 37 1/2-18 1/2; Bosnia, 35-21; Russia-2 and England, 34 
1/2-21 1/2; Bulgaria, Netherlands and United States, 34-22; Georgia, Ukraine, 
Hungary, Belarus and China, 33 1/2-22 1/2; Armenia and Israel, 33-23. On 
tiebreak, Russia-2, a team of junior stars, edged England for the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia-1, which totalled the lowest winning score in many years, suffered from 
a poor performance by its team leader, Garry Kasparov. Kasparov started with 3 
1/2-3 1/2, but he redeemed himself by defeating Nigel Short in the crucial 
Russia vs. England match. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team had its worst result in the biennial tournament since 1972. 
Thanks to seven straight wins by Yasser Seirawan of Seattle, the team recovered 
from a horrible start and contended for a medal. Their last-round 2 1/2-1 1/2 
victory over Yugoslavia left them just behind the leaders. Seirawan won the 
fourth-board prize with a score of 8 1/2-1 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 The 81-team Women's Olympiad finished much less dramatically, as defending 
champion Georgia dominated from the start. Despite easing up at the finish, 
Georgia totaled 32-10, a point ahead of Hungary. China took the bronze medal on 
tiebreak over Romania, both teams scoring 27-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Florencio Campomanes, president of the sponsoring World Chess Federation 
(FIDE), and Kasparov, leader of the rival Professional Chess Assn. (PCA), 
announced an agreement to hold a world championship reunification match in 
1996. The organizations plan separate championship matches in 1995. LOCAL NEWS

 Ben Nethercot, Calvin Powell and John Rodman shared first prize in the 
45-player Late Fall tournament at the Santa Monica Bay Chess Club. Rodman upset 
Powell in the final round to create the three-way tie at 5 1/2-1 1/2. Ron 
Hanoian, Alan Berger and Klaus Schmahle earned class prizes.

 The club, which meets Monday evenings at 1450 Ocean Ave. in Santa Monica, will

FRESNO CRASH WAS PHOENIX AIR'S 4TH FATAL ACCIDENT SINCE 1985 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's crash of a Learjet in Fresno was Phoenix Air Group Ltd.'s fourth 
fatal aviation accident since 1985, a San Francisco newspaper reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fresno, the pilot and co-pilot died Wednesday when their jet smashed into 
an apartment building while attempting an emergency landing on a residential 
street. Eighteen people on the ground were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The crews in the three previous Phoenix Air crashes also died, according to 
National Transportation Safety Board records. One crash involved a Gates 
Learjet similar to the one flown in the Fresno accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB records identified the cause of the three earlier crashes as pilot 
error, but officials of Phoenix Air, based in Cartersville, Ga., said two of 
those reports were in error. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent Thompson told the San Francisco Chronicle the cause of the first crash is 
still undetermined, and the third was caused by a mechanical failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fresno crash, which came after an Air Force training mission, was a fluke, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys left their facility in Oregon and flew down and completed the 
sortie," he said. "It was a very uneventful mission. On the way back, they ran 
into an unexpected engine problem, and you know the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 An NTSB spokesman said it will be at least six months before investigators 
know the cause of the Fresno crash, which killed Richard Anderson, 36, and Brad 
Sexton, 34, both of Klamath Falls, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 * The first of the four Phoenix Air crashes came in February, 1985, when a 
prop-driven Beechcraft crashed while taking off during a snowstorm in 
Cartersville. The NTSB said the pilot was not familiar with instrument flying 
in marginal weather. 
</P>
<P>
 * The second occurred in Monroe, La., in January, 1988, when a Gates Learjet 
36-A nosed into the ground while attempting to land. The NTSB called the pilot 
"inattentive." 
</P>
<P>
 * The third accident in June, 1989, involved a Dassault-Breguet Falcon 20 that 
clipped a utility tower and crashed while taking off from Cartersville. The 
NTSB said the pilot may have been suffering from fatigue.

WIN OVER UCLA SUITS STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Maybe it's the jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanford women's volleyball team defeated UCLA, 15-10, 5-15, 16-14, 15-13, 
on Saturday to win the NCAA championship before 8,312 in the Frank Erwin Center 
at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford Coach Don Shaw wore the same sports coat he wore for the 1992 final 
between the teams, which the Cardinal also won. A Stanford publicity director 
said it is only the second time he has ever seen Shaw wear a suit coat. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw denied he was being superstitious. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of my better jackets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the coat's role was debatable, the role of Kristin Folkl, Stanford's 
star freshman, was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Folkl, who is 6 feet 2 and one of the most dominant players in the sport, had 
a career-high 25 kills to lead Stanford to its second national title. 
</P>
<P>
 The match featured the top two teams in the Pacific 10 Conference. The 
Cardinal, 32-1 overall, won the conference title with a 17-1 record and UCLA 
(32-5, 16-2) placed second. They split their two regular-season matches, each 
winning at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the championship final, the difference was Folkl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played our hearts out tonight," said UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski. "She's a 
pretty powerful player. We couldn't turn it around when we needed to." 
</P>
<P>
 For UCLA, the fatal turn came in the third game. Leading, 14-11, the Bruins 
could not score the winning point in eight opportunities. Folkl had four kills 
and Anne Wicks and Lisa Sharpley combined on two consecutive blocks against 
Annett Buckner to wrest the game away from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't let it slip away like that, that's our mistake," UCLA's Jenny 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Banachowski merely shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had it won at one point and Stanford did too good a job siding 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Stanford took a 6-0 lead in the fourth game, Banachowski substituted Kim 
Coleman in at setter for Kelly Flannigan and UCLA battled back to take a 13-10 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, depth became a factor for UCLA. The only other reserve 
who played was Michelle Mauney, and she played sparingly. The tired Bruins 
watched as Folkl led the Cardinal back, contributing three kills on a 4-0 run 
to put the Cardinal ahead, 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were a little drained at the end of the evening," Banachowski 
said. "I think our players are in excellent shape but it is a long season. I 
think we gave it all we had." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford won when Eileen Murfee, a reserve middle blocker, and Cary Wendell, a 
junior setter-outside hitter, reached up and stuffed a spike by Johnson back on 
UCLA's side of the court.

BRUINS LOOKING G RRRR -EAT IN EASY VICTORY OVER LSU; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: UCLA 
MAKES 10 OF 18 THREE-POINT SHOTS AND PLAYS TOUGH DEFENSE ON TIGER GUARDS, 
92-72. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Searching for signs, Jim Harrick saw only portents of doom. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for a way onto the Pete Maravich Assembly Center floor, the UCLA 
Bruins were met by a full-grown Bengal tiger, yawning in its portable cage, 
blocking their path. 
</P>
<P>
 The Louisiana State mascot was eventually cleared away, but could the Bruins, 
who have recently stumbled so often in similar circumstances, stay composed 
under this kind of duress? 
</P>
<P>
 If they were searching for reasons to lose, the Bruins had plenty here 
Saturday night, before a roaring crowd of 14,551 and against an LSU team 
bristling to avenge last year's loss at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman standout J.R. Henderson had injured his back in practice Thursday, 
and his availability was questionable. UCLA's week of practice had been altered 
and abbreviated by finals week. LSU seemed due for a victory after losing each 
of its six meetings against the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our assistants that I thought we were kind of ripe for the picking 
this week," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, instead of tightening, UCLA broke loose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins shut down LSU's offense, ripped through its defense and dominated 
the Tigers, 92-72. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon scored 28 points as UCLA forced 26 turnovers, made 55.6% of its 
shots, emptied its bench with time to spare and more than solidified its hold 
on the No. 2 national ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin guards Tyus Edney and Cameron Dollar initiated the intensity with 
chest-to-chest defensive pressure on Randy Livingston and Ronnie Henderson, the 
Tigers' most talented offensive players. 
</P>
<P>
 Livingston was suffering from a bruised right kneecap and it was announced 
after the game that he had a stress fracture. He made only two of 13 shots and 
committed six turnovers. Henderson also had six turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of their backcourt and how Livingston can handle the ball, we wanted 
to make sure that we had pressure on him all the time," Dollar said. "And Tyus 
was on him, and it spread from there." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Bruins' outside shooting -- led by freshman Toby Bailey's 
three-for-four night from three-point range -- kept UCLA out front comfortably. 
J.R. Henderson was limited to less than a minute of action when his back acted 
up again, but the rest of the Bruins' regular rotation picked up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates know when I'm feeling my jump shot," Bailey said. "After that 
first one, the point guards knew I was on and they tried to set me up for the 
three-point shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, UCLA was 10 for 18 from beyond the three-point line, its best outside 
shooting performance of the season by far. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say we can't shoot, that we lack an outside perimeter game," 
said Charles O'Bannon, who had 17 points. "And I think we proved we can shoot 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, UCLA led by nine. Nine minutes into the second half, LSU (4-1) 
had committed eight turnovers in 18 second-half possessions and UCLA had a 
17-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're good, and we were terrible," said LSU Coach Dale Brown, who added 
that Livingston shouldn't have played in the game because of his injury. "I can 
never remember a game in which we did not make any runs. They totally took us 
out of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bruins (4-0), the victory was an important step in erasing the painful 
memories of last year's collapse after rising to the No. 1 ranking. Coming into 
LSU's arena with their No. 2 ranking, the Bruins, for once, did not fold. 
</P>
<P>
 And they made a point of reminding people of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "After last year, everybody out there is waiting to see when we become 
inconsistent," Dollar said. "So everybody we play is a test for us. But we're 
going out there with a hired hit-man mentality, taking out everybody put in 
front of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "(That kind of defensive pressure) might not be what you expected from past 
UCLA teams, but expect it from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ed O'Bannon: "I think it was a good test for our character. We came out, 
our first road game, after taking finals, and we really could see what we're 
about. I just hope we can keep this up and keep the intensity on the defensive 
end."

LAKERS HOPE HOME FRIENDLIER; PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER 116-102 LOSS AT SAN ANTONIO, 
TEAM WANTS TO ENHANCE STRONG PLAY ON ROAD WITH BETTER PLAY AT FORUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By late Saturday night, after they had suffered a 116-102 defeat as the San 
Antonio Spurs turned the Alamodome into the best little scorehouse in Texas, 
the Lakers had bigger problems to face. 
</P>
<P>
 Home games. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss to the Spurs, as David Robinson had 32 points and 17 rebounds and 
Dennis Rodman added 14 points and 19 rebounds, represented more than the end of 
an otherwise successful four-game trip. It marked the end of a stretch in which 
the Lakers played 14 of their first 21 games away from the Forum, ordinarily 
good news. Except that ordinarily, teams aren't 9-5 on the road and 4-3 at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading back now to the Forum for nine of their next 12 outings, starting with 
Minnesota on Tuesday, this suddenly becomes an issue for the Lakers. They know 
it better than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly," said Vlade Divac, who played only 29 minutes against the Spurs 
because of foul trouble. "We have to do a better job at home. We should take 
advantage now of the schedule. We should win 85% of our home games and be good 
on the road. We're in a good position. We have the (most road wins) in the 
league. Now we have to do the same at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Eddie Jones: "The guys just get up for games on the road because we feel 
like everyone is against us. It's kind of a good feeling for us to know that we 
have to rely so much on each other. We've done a good job with that. That makes 
us play even harder." 
</P>
<P>
 It should help, then, that the Lakers' home attendance is near the bottom of 
the league despite the very encouraging start, at 12,326. Ditto that they have 
only two contests over the next nine days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely a better road team because of the situation with the 
limelight in L.A.," Cedric Ceballos said. "It's tough to get to the business at 
hand because of everything else that's going on. Plus, we haven't been there 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 So what do they need to do now? 
</P>
<P>
 "Win," he said. "That's the only difference. Like I said, it's real difficult 
playing at home sometimes because we don't get the rest we do on the road. We 
don't always have the same concentration." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, rest shouldn't have been a problem on the just-completed trip, not 
with a schedule that included at least one day off between each game and the 
resulting three victories and no tired legs. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Lakers took a 54-51 lead at halftime, even with Ceballos 
shooting two for seven and Nick Van Exel one for seven. The shooting percentage 
continued to drop in the third quarter, but it was still 69-69 with 4:02 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the Spurs pulled away, using a 13-2 run in the next three minutes 
for an 82-71 advantage. They followed that midway through the fourth period by 
scoring on seven of eight possessions to build a 104-90 lead, with Robinson 
accounting for three of the baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman? He was impossible to miss too. If it wasn't the bright-green dye job, 
it was that nine of his 19 rebounds came on offensive boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a little bit off tonight, but I started to get my rhythm late in the 
game," he said after his third game following a well-publicized suspension and 
leave of absence. "I could of had 25 rebounds if I wanted to, but I'm still 
trying to get in the flow of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to start to put the ball in the basket more. I've got to start 
putting it back up when I get the board. I should be able to score 13 or 14 
points a game, and then maybe I can win the most improved player award as well 
as the rebounding title."

A SEASON GOES BAD IN SEATTLE; PRO FOOTBALL: FADING SEAHAWKS 6-8 AS THEY PLAY 
RAIDERS, WHO COULD CLINCH A PLAYOFF BERTH BY WINNING TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sixteen weeks ago, the Seattle Seahawks began the season as one of the 
promising young teams in the NFL. They featured a promising quarterback, Rick 
Mirer, who seemed poised to realize his potential in his second NFL season; a 
promising superstar, running back Chris Warren, who seemed ready to challenge 
for the rushing title after consecutive 1,000-yard seasons, and enough other 
promising talent to make a serious run at their first playoff berth in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks made good on that promise for the first two weeks, winning their 
first two games, one a 38-9 victory over the Raiders at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen weeks into the season, however, the number 16 is a painful reminder of 
another year of unfulfilled promise and shattered dreams for the AFC West's 
long-struggling franchise. Going into tonight's game against the Raiders in the 
Seattle Kingdome, Seattle has lost 16 players to injury, 10 of them starters. 
The Seahawks no longer resemble a contender. They look more like a team trying 
to make it through the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the physical pain pales in comparison to the mental anguish that has 
engulfed this club in the wake of the car accident 2 1/2 weeks ago that left 
defensive tackle Mike Frier paralyzed with a broken back, Warren with two 
cracked ribs and running back Lamar Smith with a chip fracture in his neck and 
an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with all their problems, the Seahawks, inspired by Warren, managed to 
pull out a 16-14 victory last week over the Houston Oilers, running their 
record to 6-8. Warren, fighting to breath, wincing on every hit, rushed for a 
career-high 185 yards and dived into the end zone for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You dedicate yourself to doing the best you can, and play for the others that 
can't," Seattle Coach Tom Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a long pep-talk guy. But you have to just point out the issues and 
point out the facts and depend on some of your leaders to motivate and go on 
with business. Even though business isn't as usual sometimes, you have to go on 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of the tragedy, when your expectations haven't reached what you 
thought they were, it can be a down time. We have a very young team. . . . They 
need guidance. We try to keep everything in house and not panic." 
</P>
<P>
 The other major figures missing: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Nate Odomes, a projected starter who had knee surgery in June. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guard Mitch Frerotte, who suffered a neck injury in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Patrick Hunter, who suffered a torn hamstring in Week 3. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guard Bill Hitchcock, who injured his back in Week 6. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tight end Ferrell Edmunds, who was sidelined because of bulging back disks 
in Week 8. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Defensive end Brent Williams, who suffered a sprained knee in Week 11. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Carlton Gray, who suffered a broken arm in Week 12. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mirer, who suffered a broken thumb in Week 14. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offensive tackle Ray Roberts, who suffered a broken leg in Week 15. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free safety Eugene Robinson, who suffered a torn Achilles' tendon in Week 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 The key replacement will be at quarterback, where Dan McGwire is filling in 
for Mirer, who passed for three touchdowns against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-8, 240-pound McGwire was a first-round draft choice of the Seahawks 
from San Diego State. Yet three years later, he is still best known as the 
brother of first baseman Mark McGwire of the Oakland Athletics. Injuries, 
inconsistency and the arrival of Mirer limited McGwire to only five games in 
his first three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he had thrown only four passes in the regular season until Mirer 
was injured in the second quarter against the Indianapolis Colts two weeks ago. 
Relieving Mirer in that game, McGwire completed 15 of 24 passes for 145 yards 
and a touchdown, with one interception.  
</P>
<P>
 But in getting the start last week against the Oilers, McGwire struggled, 
completing only eight of 17 passes for 95 yards and no touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have that impressive a day as far as throwing the ball," Flores 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 If McGwire is not the answer, it would appear the Seahawks' best chance for 
victory would be to stay on the ground with Warren, cracke ribs and all.  
</P>
<P>
 But in doing so, Seattle will be running into the strength of the Raiders. 
Their run defense has been the most impressive part of a defensive unit that 
ranks second in the AFC behind the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their problems, the Seahawks will get no sympathy from the Raiders 
(8-6), who were struggling with an injured quarterback of their own in Jeff 
Hostetler when these teams last met, but have rebounded so well that they can 
clinch a playoff berth today with a victory if the Kansas City Chiefs lose to 
the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite their early struggles, the Raiders are still alive in the race 
for the AFC West title, needing victories in their final two games, coupled 
with losses by the San Diego Chargers in their last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler denied he had arm problems in the first two games this season, but 
team sources insist he did. Whatever his problems, he couldn't seem to throw a 
spiral against Seattle, winding up with three interceptions in one of his worst 
performances of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever was troubling him then, Hostetler is back in form and the Raiders 
arrive at the Kingdome with only safety Eddie Anderson questionable among the 
starters. He has a groin pull. 
</P>
<P>
 One starter questionable? 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks haven't had it that good since summer.

CLIPPERS HELP DALLAS BREAK LOSING STREAK; PRO BASKETBALL: LOS ANGELES' 106-87 
LOSS IS ITS FIRST TO THE MAVERICKS IN 12 MEETINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Clipper Coach Bill Fitch and Maverick Coach Dick Motta began their 
coaching careers, most of their players were more interested in Big Bird than 
Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Jason Kidd, the Mavericks' top draft pick, wasn't born when Motta 
began coaching in 1968 with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't even thought about when he began coaching," Kidd said. "I was three 
years off from being even conceived. Everybody says that he could be my 
grandfather, but I don't look at his age or his gray hair. He can help me 
become a better basketball player and a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, 60, and Motta, 63, the NBA's two oldest coaches, are coaching two of 
the league's youngest teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get together for our cup of Geritol before the game," Fitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fitch might need Geritol if the Clippers continue to play like they did in 
a 106-87 loss to the Mavericks on Saturday night before 17,578 at The Pond of 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that bothered me tonight is I thought our defense could have been a 
little better," Fitch said after Dallas shot 50.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Jim Jackson, who had 40 points in his last game, scored 31 points as the 
Mavericks won their second game in a row. Forward Jamal Mashburn had 28 points, 
including 19 in the first half, as Dallas defeated the Clippers for the first 
time in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA's third-winningest coach, Motta has helped the Mavericks, who finished 
with the NBA's worst record for the last two seasons, get off to their best 
start since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas (11-8), which won only 13 games last season, is two victories away from 
matching last season's total. Five of the Mavericks' victories have come 
against teams that made the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything else, (Motta's) experience is really what's helping this 
team," Jackson said. "He understands the NBA game. The system that he employs 
helps everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The game marked the first meeting between Clipper rookie forward Lamond 
Murray, the seventh player picked in the NBA draft, and Kidd. They played 
together at Cal the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time I can remember playing against Lamond was in practice," Kidd 
said. "He'd be one of the designated shooters." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said there was no significance in playing against Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not matched up one on one, so what competition could there be?" he 
said. "I'm concentrating on Mashburn. It's not like a contest out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd had five points, nine assists and six rebounds and played tight defense 
against Clipper guard Pooh Richardson, who missed all 10 shots he took. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray struggled, missing eight of his first 12 shots and scoring eight points 
in the first half as the Clippers fell behind by 17 points, 52-35. Murray 
finished with 22 points, making 10 of 25 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 He struggled defensively against Mashburn, who made 11 of 22 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Troubled Dallas forward Roy Tarpley returned after serving a one-game 
suspension for a profane exchange with Motta in the Mavericks' 115-108 loss to 
the Lakers on Tuesday at Dallas. The suspension cost Tarpley $36,585. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were expensive words," Tarpley said. "It's over with. I'm through 
talking. You read the paper. You saw it on the news. I'm not going to go over 
it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarpley had 21 points and 16 rebounds in 31 minutes as a reserve. Center 
Lorenzo Williams had a career-high 15 rebounds as Dallas outrebounded the 
Clippers, 54-42.

SANDERS LEAVES VIKINGS GRASPING FOR AIR; NFC: LIONS ALL BUT CLINCH PLAYOFF SPOT 
WHILE MINNESOTA LOSES GAME, 41-19, AND QUARTERBACK MOON TO INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fans still sing a fight song here, in this place bereft of professional 
cheerleaders, and end zone dances, and quitters. 
</P>
<P>
 The star running back still has never spiked the ball. The coach is 
thick-jowled and jolly and smokes cigars. 
</P>
<P>
 More than an hour after important victories, players still can be found in 
their ragged game pants, their eyes surrounded by black shoe polish and filled 
with wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "People had our whole team dead . . . . dead and buried," Detroit Lion 
linebacker Chris Spielman said Saturday. "Call me biased, stupid, crazy. But I 
think we can play with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 On magical afternoons like the Lions experienced against the powerful 
Minnesota Vikings, they can do better than that. How does a 41-19 whipping of a 
team with the league's fifth-ranked defense sound? 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Sanders, the star running back, made moves that dropped Vikings to their 
knees. Mel Gray returned kicks that left them holding their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Then quarterback Dave Krieg, 36, put it all into context -- as the Lions do so 
well -- by conducting his postgame news conference while baby-sitting his two 
young sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we surprised the whole NFL," Lion linebacker Pat Swilling said. "When 
they see that score, they aren't going to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome, before a raucous Silverdome crowd of 73,881, virtually ensured 
that the Lions will make the playoffs despite having a 5-6 record a month ago. 
They are tied with the Vikings for first place in the NFC Central with a 9-6 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 It also ensured that the Vikings, who began the season 7-2, still have not 
clinched the championship going into next week's season finale against the 
49ers in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 And they may have to win that game without quarterback Warren Moon, who 
suffered a strained ligament in his left knee with 7:33 remaining in the third 
period after Swilling was blocked into his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a similar injury earlier this season 
and sat out two games. If the same thing happens here -- the Vikings will know 
more today after an MRI examination -- that could mean a regular-season-ending 
two losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup Brad Johnson, when he wasn't throwing the ball 10 feet over receivers' 
heads Saturday, was heaving it out of bounds. He completed less than half of 
his passes (14 for 29) for only 104 yards and no touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only good news for the Vikings came early, when Cris Carter caught 
his 113th pass to break Sterling Sharpe's one-year-old record. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Lions, the Vikings can clinch a playoff spot today if two of the 
following four teams lose -- Arizona, Chicago, Philadelphia or Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lions are not backing in. True to their 1950s personality, this team 
and its 1935 uniforms won not with gimmicks or tricks, but with steady punches 
to the midsection. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them, as usual, delivered by Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does things that people will never, ever see," Spielman said. "People on 
other teams are always coming up to me after games and saying, 'Man, this guy 
is in his own league.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, the NFL rushing leader who was held to a season-low 16 yards in the 
first meeting between these teams, scored on runs of 18 and 64 yards while 
gaining 110 yards total. He needs 169 next week against Miami to reach 2,000 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew what they were doing, we knew what was going to happen, we even knew 
a lot of their plays . . . . and yet we couldn't stop them," said Roy Barker, 
Viking defensive end. "It was just, basically, Barry." 
</P>
<P>
 In typical Sanders fashion, his 18-yard run that gave the Lions a 
two-touchdown lead in the third period was more impressive than his 64-yard run 
nine minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first score, he avoiding one diving defender, juked another, and 
carried a third across the goal line. In his second score, he simply found a 
hole on the left side and sprinted from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still in awe of him," said guard Shawn Bouwens, who has blocked for 
Sanders for four years. "He literally drops defensive guys to their knees. Just 
takes away their breath." 
</P>
<P>
 And he never, ever rubs it in. It has become the stuff of legends that 
Sanders' next spike will be his first. 
</P>
<P>
 His cocky statements on Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting contributions from everybody," Sanders said. "We've kind of 
shaken the reputation of being one dimensional." 
</P>
<P>
 He was speaking of Gray, whose dazzling 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown 
in the first quarter was his ninth career scoring return, tying Ollie Matson 
for the NFL record. 
</P>
<P>
 He was speaking of Krieg, 5-1 since taking over for injured free-agent bust 
Scott Mitchell. Krieg missed on only five of 20 passes, threw twice for 
touchdowns and was not intercepted, giving him 13 touchdowns and one 
interception since becoming the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was also speaking, believe it or not, of first-round draft pick 
Johnnie Morton from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 For only the second time this season, Morton actually had a catch. For the 
first time, it was for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Running a slant pattern from the 18-yard line, Morton made a leaping catch at 
the same time Vencie Glenn attempted a leaping tackle. Only by clutching the 
ball to his helmet did Morton hang on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't catch the ball, people won't think I'm good," Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He shouldn't have to worry about that, if only because many in the NFL don't 
think many of the Lions are any good. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least that's what you think," Barker mumbled Saturday. "One day they are 
down, (Wayne) Fontes is getting fired, this and that are going wrong. Then all 
of a sudden . . . . they are God's gift." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, a charming antique.

 Penn State's appearance in the Rose Bowl game recalls the Nittany Lions' first 
visit to Pasadena, on Jan. 1, 1923, to play USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penn State team arrived about 45 minutes late for the game, causing 
anguish for Gloomy Gus Henderson, USC's coach.  
</P>
<P>
 Henderson accused Penn State Coach Hugo Bezdek of deliberately stalling to 
upset the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 They exchanged heated words and, just when it appeared that a fight was 
imminent, were separated by onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, USC won, 14-3, in its first Rose Bowl appearance. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Trivia time: Besides Penn State, Bezdek coached two other Rose Bowl teams. Can 
you identify them?

 Opinion: Dick Moss, former official in the baseball players' union, speaking

IRVINE SURPRISES EARLY BUT GETS BLASTED LATE; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ANTEATERS 
WITHER UNDER ARIZONA STATE'S UNRELENTING SECOND-HALF PRESSURE AND COLLAPSE, 
87-58. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Rod Baker ran his finger down UC Irvine's nonconference schedule before 
the season and pointed to games against Ohio University and Arizona State. "I 
think we're good enough to play with all of these teams but maybe these two," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters proved him wrong during a tough overtime loss to the 14th-ranked 
Bobcats Dec. 2. And they appeared ready to prove him wrong against the Sun 
Devils Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (2-3) held a 47-42 lead over 13th-ranked Arizona State with 13:43 left, 
but then the Sun Devils discovered a new gear and ran away with an 87-58 
victory before 6,249 at the University Activities Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Arizona State only four minutes to turn that five-point deficit into a 
10-point lead with a 15-0 run. And the Sun Devils (5-1) were on cruise control 
only three minutes after that, holding a 69-51 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought walking into the building tonight that we could play with these 
guys, but I guess we're only good enough to play with them for 30 minutes," 
Baker said. "The fact that we didn't rebound in the second half is what killed 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "But don't get me wrong. They are a very, very good team. They are definitely 
going to hurt some people's feelings in the Pac-10 this season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils' full-court press caused 13 second-half turnovers. And their 
mastery of the boards after halftime -- they outrebounded Irvine by 16 after 
the teams both had 21 in the first half -- turned the contest from a potential 
upset into a laugher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so bad in the first half," Arizona State Coach Bill Frieder said. "We 
hadn't played in two weeks and when you don't shoot well, you don't play well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils, who entered the game with the second-best field-goal 
percentage (.567) in the country, made only 34% of their first-half shots from 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Isaac Burton, who finished with a team-high 18 points, began to find 
the range outside, it opened things up for forward Mario Bennett, who scored 10 
points in the second half and ended up with 14 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, which had used a balanced attack to defeat its last two opponents, did 
not get a point from its leading scorer, point guard Raimonds Miglinieks, or 
its top-scoring inside threat, freshman forward Kevin Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 "When your starting point guard and a starting forward don't score a point, I 
don't care who you are, you're going to have trouble winning," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks, who always looks to pass before shooting, had six assists but did 
not even attempt a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't have a good shot, I'm not going to shoot," said Miglinieks, who 
had 828 assists in two years at Riverside City College. "We were taking our 
shots too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played good for awhile, but you have to play all 40 minutes. If you can't 
play for 40 minutes, then just go off the court."

TITANS SPOIL HOME DEBUT FOR UNLV'S GRGURICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris St. Clair made a three-point shot with eight seconds left Saturday night 
that lifted Cal State Fullerton to an 82-80 victory over Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome spoiled the home debut of new UNLV Coach Tim Grgurich, the 
longtime assistant under Jerry Tarkanian, who was in a courtside seat in his 
first visit to the Thomas & Mack Center for a game since he was ousted three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third consecutive loss for the Rebels. Fullerton is 2-3 and has won 
three of the last four games against UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton also surprised the Rebels, 84-75, in Las Vegas last season, when the 
Titans won only eight games. It was one of five defeats the Rebels suffered at 
home in a 15-13 season under Rollie Massimino, who was forced out with a 
$1.8-million buyout in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans were down by 12 points at one stage in the second half, but Winston 
Peterson's layup with 53 seconds left closed the deficit to 80-79. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV's Reggie Manuel was called for traveling in a scramble for a loose ball 
with 28 seconds to go, setting the stage for St. Clair's shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept telling our kids to hang in there, and they were able to deal with 
their run and stay close," Fullerton Coach Bob Hawking said. "We were trying to 
get that kind of shot at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids really played hard and this was a great win for our program." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson had 25 points to lead the Titans. St. Clair finished with 17 points 
and Chris Dade had 16. Manuel had 26 points for UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 An 11-0 run put Fullerton ahead, 19-9, but the Rebels came back to cut the 
deficit to 22-21. Fullerton, however, turned back that rush and held on for a 
39-36 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans were six points ahead with only a few seconds remaining in the 
first half, but reserve John Williams fouled Clayton Johnson on a long-range 
three-point attempt and Johnson made all three free throws with no time left.

LOYOLA MARYMOUNT PASSES TEST IN 80-71 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Returning to action after a 10-day layoff because of final exams, Loyola 
Marymount's players weren't at their best Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lions still met with the approval of Coach John Olive, who could 
complain only so much after his team overcame a sluggish performance to defeat 
foul-plagued Loyola of Chicago, 80-71, in a nonconference game at Gersten 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 10 days off hurt us," Olive said. "We weren't sharp. We looked a little 
fatigued. The intensity wasn't there like it usually is. But we won the game, 
and that's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions (5-1), off to their best start since opening the 1989-90 season 6-1, 
committed 23 turnovers and shot 46% from the field. But it was difficult for 
Olive not to smile. In his three seasons at Loyola, he rarely has had the 
luxury of enjoying a victory after a bad game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's unusual for us," he said. "Hopefully, it's a sign of maturity, of 
finding ways to win when you don't play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Loyola of Chicago (2-3) did little to take advantage of the 
situation. The Ramblers shot 35% (27 of 78) and committed 30 fouls, resulting 
in Loyola Marymount shooting 41 free throws. The Lions made 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The most critical foul occurred with 7:43 to play when Bernie Salthe, the 
Ramblers' 6-foot-11 center, fouled out on a charging call near the basket. 
Loyola of Chicago Coach Ken Burmeister complained and drew a technical foul, 
resulting in Jim Williamson making one of two free throws to give Loyola 
Marymount a 62-53 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, the Lions' sophomore point guard, also did what he was supposed to 
do, making four free throws in the final 1:01 after Loyola of Chicago had cut 
the deficit to 76-71, the smallest it got in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Wyking Jones led Loyola Marymount with 22 points and nine rebounds, 
forward Mike O'Quinn had 17 points and four blocked shots, Ime Odouk had a 
game-high 13 rebounds, and Williamson had 12 points and six assists.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; DEFENSIVE KEY UNLOCKS INDIANA UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indiana figures it can't count on its shooting, so it had better count on 
defense to win games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers held Kansas seven minutes without a point and got 29 points from 
Brian Evans and 22 from Alan Henderson in beating the No. 3 Jayhawks, 80-61, 
Saturday to extend the nation's longest home winning streak to 47 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "All week long we prepared on their individual players, what we can take away 
from them, how we can improve our position on defense every time down the 
court," Henderson said. "As we grow as a team, we're learning how to execute 
the things we practice and carry them over into the game a little better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, defense is the key. We know we don't have the kind of team that 
can just go out there and out-shoot somebody night in and night out." 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana (5-4) used a 15-0 run to build a 39-19 lead in a first half in which 
it held Jayhawk shooters to 26%. Kansas shot only 36% all day long. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana shot only 23% in the second half and 35% for the game, but made 27 of 
35 free throws to only four of nine for Kansas (5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "Indiana kicked our tails every way it can get kicked," Kansas Coach Roy 
Williams said. "They were more intense, more focused and more aggressive. . . . 
You can look at the stats all you want. The bottom line is that they outplayed 
us and outcoached us." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who "outcoached" Williams, Indiana's Bob Knight, declined to speak 
with the media after the game.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; IF RILEY, KNICKS SURVIVE THIS, MORE POWER TO THEM

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Friedrich Nietzsche and Pat Riley like to say: That which does not kill me 
makes me stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 By that standard, the New York Knicks are going to be monsters by the spring, 
assuming they survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Also by that standard, the best thing for them is that which almost kills 
them. That's what they're going through now. 
</P>
<P>
 Aging, limping, slumping and snapping at each other, they're running a distant 
second to loaded, young Orlando, threatening Riley's career-long string of 
first-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Overmatched, frustrated and batted around in the New York papers like a beach 
ball, Riley is snapping too, even ridiculing his players for their sniveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a week in their lives (be glad it's not yours): 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 9 -- Knicks lose in Atlanta, 89-85. Ice-cold John Starks gets open, 
waves his hands but is ignored by Patrick Ewing. As they run downcourt, Starks 
says something to Ewing. During the next timeout, Ewing rips into Starks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any comment on that," Ewing says later. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the bench during the timeout, Starks puts his head into his towel 
and starts crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Charles Oakley ignores an open Starks on an inbounds play. A 
conspiracy theory is suspected, a result of Starks' two-week slump, memories of 
his two-for-18 performance in Game 7 in Houston during last season's finals, 
and players' resentment of Riley's coddling (Riley adores Starks' courage; 
other Knicks sometimes call Starks "Riley's son"). Faced with an open schism, 
Riley throws in with Ewing and Oakley, telling Starks, forcefully, he had no 
right to question Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yells Riley at Starks in front of teammates, "Who are you to ever question 
anybody's shot selection?" 
</P>
<P>
 Good point. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 10 -- At home against the Philadelphia 76ers, Riley benches Starks and 
Greg Anthony. The Knicks have to rally to win, 107-103. When Doc Rivers fouls 
out, Riley sends in Hubert Davis as the crowd chants for Starks. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley says with a straight face, "I never heard it once." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 12 -- At home against the Miami Heat, the Knicks give up at least 120 
points for the second time this month and lose, 122-111. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks comes off the bench but goes one for nine, his only basket a breakaway 
layup. Fans cheer when he enters, boo him later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hold up!" Starks barks at reporters. "Let me say this for everybody! No more 
questions about my shooting! That (stuff) is over!" 
</P>
<P>
 Riley tries his trusty guilt trip on reporters to get everyone off Starks' 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to rake him over the coals, rake him over the coals," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley also reserves similar coal-raking privileges. Asked about Anthony, who 
was unhappy at being benched without being told, he gets indignant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it necessary every single time to sit down and explain why you're 
doing something?" Riley asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why has it gotten that way in the NBA that players say, 'He didn't talk to 
me?' These guys are pros, making millions of dollars. Their job is to come and 
play, accept a role." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley goes on to note the "self-centered, greed-oriented, defiant attitudes" 
running rampant in the NBA, which he believes "are going to bring this league 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 13 -- Riley announces the real problem is a jammed roster: 14 players 
with guaranteed contracts for 12 slots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 priority on this team is to clean up the roster," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't one player who doesn't understand that the hammer is going to 
fall shortly. They don't want to talk about it because it's uncomfortable, but 
they know. It's going to happen shortly. I can't guarantee anybody, except for 
certain core members, that they're going to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if you send your laundry out, ask for 24-hour service. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 14 -- The New York Times' George Vecsey writes that Riley is carrying 
on a "one-man crusade against the dreaded 'disease of me' (in other people)." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 15 -- Headline in the New York Times: "Attitude Check Begins with 
Riley." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Knicks have the same "core" Riley used to praise for playing 
with such heart. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to the Knicks this season is last season. After a record-tying 
24-game playoff season -- Riley's championship '88 Lakers also played 24 -- 
they had a short summer to heal but couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing had arthroscopic knee surgery and still has occasional swelling. Oakley 
was talked out of surgery on his dislocated toe and says he's in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Knicks' $3-million-a-year contract extension -- more than twice 
as much as any other coach makes -- sits on Riley's desk, unsigned. Skeptics 
say he'd be silly to sign before the season ends and they know if they're going 
to have a parade or a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this day has been coming since Riley, who grew up as a coach of a 
dynasty in the soft breezes of Southern California, took his 
ever-more-high-powered act to merciless Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't noticed, he isn't the same lovable, unassuming Riles who as a 
young Laker coach said, "I want the players to use the court as an arena to 
express themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he wants them to use the court as an arena to express himself. 
</P>
<P>
 They're trying. He may question their spirit, but their flesh looks like the 
problem. OK, NOW I'M READY TO HANDICAP THIS 
</P>
<P>
 The key to punditry lies in making enough guesses to assure that one blunders 
onto the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's just hope we're getting warmer: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ATLANTIC DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 1. Orlando Magic -- OK, so they're kids who have never won a playoff game. On 
the other hand, they have overpowering talent, Horace Grant is a perfect fit 
and, most important, who else is there in the East? 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana General Manager Donnie Walsh says of Shaquille O'Neal, "I don't think 
people understand yet the way this guy changes the game. What are you going to 
do to stop this guy? If you double-team him, he knocks them down and dunks on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 2. Knicks -- Authoritarian or not, Riley is a great coach whose tenacity is 
legendary and he can never be written off. But if he expects to win a title 
with this crew, he has his work cut out for him. 
</P>
<P>
 3. New Jersey Nets -- Business as usual: players fighting a guerrilla war 
against Coach Butch Beard, rallying late to grab the seventh or eighth playoff 
spot, losing in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Washington Bullets -- A rally gets them to ninth best in the East and 
another lottery pick, which will come in handy for the Golden State Warriors, 
who acquired it in the Chris Webber trade. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Boston Celtics -- Nice pickup, Dominique Wilkins. Looks like 35 victories 
and the last pick in the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Heat -- Nice trades. 
</P>
<P>
 7. 76ers -- Shawn Bradley has made strides since the first week when Orlando's 
Nick Anderson called what O'Neal did to him "child abuse." But we're talking 
l-o-n-g term project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CENTRAL DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 1. Indiana Pacers -- Year II of the Larry Brown era and everything's still OK! 
Look for them in the Eastern finals on the who-else-is-there theory. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Charlotte Hornets -- Or Allan Bristow is gone. Larry Johnson looks better 
but still not the old LJ. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Cleveland Cavaliers -- Mike Fratello has never coached better, but Brad 
Daugherty is out for the season and Mark Price's numbers are the lowest since 
his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Chicago Bulls -- Phil Jackson and Scottie Pippen prove they can make the 
playoffs (in the East, anyway) with 11 guys off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Atlanta Hawks -- General Manager Pete Babcock bit the bullet and traded 
Wilkins and Kevin Willis, but they're trapped in the middle: not good enough to 
go anywhere in the playoffs, too high in the draft to get a star. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Detroit Pistons -- Grant Hill was a huge plus. Oliver Miller is a 
$10-million weight on their salary cap. If they don't wise up, good luck won't 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Milwaukee Bucks -- At his current pace, Glenn Robinson will overcome Hill's 
insurmountable lead in the rookie-of-the-year race by Christmas. The Bucks have 
a doughnut hole at center and here's their last chance to get one in the 
lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MIDWEST DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 1. Houston Rockets -- Even if they aren't at last season's level. In case you 
haven't noticed, the West isn't chock-full of dynasties, either. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Utah Jazz -- America's most boring 50-game winners. 
</P>
<P>
 3. San Antonio Spurs -- OK, they got Dennis Rodman back on the reservation. 
How long can they keep him there? 
</P>
<P>
 4. Denver Nuggets -- LaPhonso Ellis is gone for the season; Dikembe Mutombo 
has claimed his shots. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Dallas Mavericks -- Jason Kidd, no factor in the rookie race, still looks 
like the point guard of the '90s. The Minnesota Timberwolves owe them one of 
their next three No. 1 picks for Sean Rooks, so things are looking good. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Minnesota -- Latest escapade for the Brat Pack: Coach Bill Blair says 
Isaiah Rider "has to grow up." Rider calls a news conference to reply, proving 
Blair's point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PACIFIC DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 1. Phoenix Suns -- They haven't put their first team on the floor yet and the 
way Paul Westphal is coaching, might not when Kevin Johnson returns. So far, 
"the Nellie of the Desert" has tried bringing Charles Barkley, Danny Manning 
and Dan Majerle off the bench. They're still the league's best show. David 
Stern must pray nightly for a Phoenix-Orlando final. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Seattle SuperSonics -- Around the league, everyone is on pins and needles, 
waiting for the blowup. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Portland Trail Blazers -- P.J. Carlesimo's first hurrah, their last. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Lakers -- Fifty victories? I'll believe that when I see it. Oh, they're 
already on a 50-victory pace? 
</P>
<P>
 5. Sacramento Kings -- Little-known rookie bruisers Brian Grant and Michael 
Smith energized a seemingly hopeless situation. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Warriors -- Heartbreak Hotel. There's speculation this could be Don 
Nelson's last season on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Clippers -- Let's look at the bright side; except for a slow start, they'd 
be in the playoff hunt. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen, the Bulls' new voice of reason, on Jackson's theory that the new 
United Center has ruined their home-court advantage: "Let the record show that 
I haven't complained about the new arena. I feel good professional players can 
play anywhere." . . . Jackson, worried that the high ceiling is disorienting, 
moved shoot-arounds downtown from the suburban facility where they shot while 
winning three titles. Said irreverent center Will Perdue: "Interesting, but 
wouldn't it also be harder for the other team?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, he now plays in the East: Ron ($19.2 million for five years) 
Harper is averaging 12 points against Western teams, six against the East. On 
the other hand, Harper, pilloried here after moping through last season, gave 
Clipper trainer Keith Jones and equipment man Pete Serrano $1,000 watches on 
his return to Los Angeles. . . . Pacer warhorse LaSalle Thompson on Larry 
Brown: "I think there are only three great coaches, Larry, Pat Riley and Lenny 
Wilkens. The rest of them you can interchange and the teams would do about the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Scott: "Larry and Pat Riley are a lot alike in that they're both very 
driven to win, they are both very good with X's and O's. But in how they deal 
with players, they're different. Riley separated himself from us. Larry doesn't 
do that. He wants to be around us. He cares about us as people." . . . The 
Clippers, Pacers and 76ers are reportedly interested in Roy Tarpley, now on 
terminal outs with Dallas Coach Dick Motta. Meanwhile, people are wondering why 
the Mavericks ignored Tarpley's pleas for a trade, brought their prodigal back 
once more -- then gave him a six-year, $25-million contract? 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman, on his plans now that he has rejoined the Spurs: "They don't 
have any guidelines that I'm going to follow. Nothing's changed. I'm still 
black. I still wear (dark) glasses. I've still got tattoos. If you (reporters) 
want some ammunition, there it is. You guys blow it out of proportion anyway. 
There's nothing exciting in San Antonio, so you have to twist it out of 
proportion." Comment: Sounds like the start of a beautiful friendship. . . . 
Spur Coach Bob Hill, watching Rodman pass up a layup to pass to Moses Malone: 
"Dennis hasn't shot since Lincoln died." 
</P>
<P>
 Webber, after the Bullets dropped to 2-10 since acquiring him: "I'm 
emotionally drained, nearly burned out. I'm not going to get used to this. I'm 
never going to get used to this." Comment: We'll see. . . . Net madman Chris 
Morris, fined $500 after refusing Beard's order to tie his shoelaces after 
entering a game, says he deserves a role like Kenny Anderson's and Derrick 
Coleman's ("Why did they put me on the All-Star ballot then?") but is confident 
everything will turn out for him. "Will I get $2 million somewhere else?" 
Morris said. "With two expansion teams coming in, heck yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley, after a victory over the Nets: "Something is wrong with that team." 
Comment: No kidding. . . . Seattle Coach George Karl, bristling after Shawn 
Kemp got a technical foul on one of his post-dunk primal-screams: "He should 
have gotten thrown out. I just don't understand that stuff. Call me an old 
dork, but this is supposed to be about team." . . . Barkley, arguing that he 
and Buddy Ryan are the best things to have happened to Phoenix: "Before, there 
were a lot of old people just waiting to die." . . . Well, maybe not the very 
best things: Westphal, asked if Barkley, also an Auburn alum, has much 
influence on Auburn rookie Wesley Person: "Not too much, I hope."

NBA ROUNDUP; NO MAGIC IN TACOMA FOR ORLANDO IN LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Magic seems invincible in Orlando, with a 10-0 record. The road, though, 
is another story. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando has a 17-5 record, tied with Phoenix for the best in the NBA, but the 
Magic suffered through a humiliating Saturday in Tacoma, Wash., losing to the 
Seattle SuperSonics, 124-84. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Payton had 31 points and a season-high seven steals for Seattle, which 
held Shaquille O'Neal, the league's leading scorer, to 15 points a night after 
he had scored 40 against Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 He made only six of 15 shots against double- and triple-teaming defenses and 
was held to five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal said the SuperSonics used their fast break to build a commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were a bit tired and they were ready for us," O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando had scored a season-high 131 points Friday and had a season-low 84 
Saturday. The Magic lost for only the third time in its last 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Payton scored 24 points in the first half as the SuperSonics took a 61-34 
halftime lead. Kendall Gill scored 23 of his season-high 25 points in the 
second half for Seattle, which won its ninth consecutive home game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was by far our best game of the season," Seattle Coach George Karl said. 
"Gary was fantastic. I don't know if I've ever seen him play better." 
</P>
<P>
 Anfernee Hardaway, Orlando's point guard, was limited to only 17 minutes 
because of a sore left hamstring. Starting forward Donald Royal bruised his 
right knee at the end of the first half and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 109, Sacramento 98 -- Charles Barkley had season highs with 27 points 
and 14 rebounds in the Suns' 22nd consecutive home victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning added 22 points for Phoenix, which has won seven in a row 
overall and held its last five opponents to fewer than 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 112, Houston 109 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 43 points, making five of 
six three-point shots, as the Celtics won at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first victory in three games for Boston and only its third victory 
in the last 10 outings. The Rockets have lost eight of 12 after opening the 
season with nine consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 97, Chicago 89 -- Karl Malone had 30 points and 14 rebounds and John 
Stockton added 15 assists as the Jazz pulled away late for a club-record 
seventh consecutive road victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped the Bulls to 5-5 in their new home, the United Center, after 
they dominated teams in the old Chicago Stadium in previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 97, Philadelphia 92 -- Terry Mills scored 32 points and Joe Dumars 
added 22, including two crucial free throws with 11 seconds to play, as the 
Pistons broke a five-game losing streak by winning at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams did well in three-point shooting, Philadelphia connecting on 10 of 
23 and Detroit on eight of 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 96, Atlanta 85 -- Kevin Willis had 24 points and 11 rebounds in his 
first game against his former team as the Heat won in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis, traded by Atlanta for Steve Smith and Grant Long on Nov. 7, spent the 
first nine years of his NBA career with the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 111, Denver 92 -- Hersey Hawkins scored a season-high 28 points to 
lead the Hornets in a victory over Denver in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, limited to two points on one-for-seven shooting in Friday night's 
loss to Indiana, made 12 of 18 shots against the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 96, Washington 87 -- Doug West tied his season best with a game-high 
25 points in Landover, Md., as the Timberwolves won their second in a row and 
sent the Bullets to their fifth consecutive defeat.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; CAMERAS FLASH AS SERENA'S SONG WINS THE STARLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The photo finish went Serena's Song's way this time, and after that photo 
there were more pictures Saturday as the three Hollywood Park stewards briefly 
reviewed a foul claim against the winner of the $250,000 Hollywood Starlet. 
</P>
<P>
 In the winner's circle, Wayne Lukas, Serena's Song's trainer, couldn't figure 
out what the fuss was about. "If that's interference," Lukas said, "then you've 
got it nine times a day, in every race." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't compensate for the narrow loss to a stablemate, Flanders, in the 
$1-million Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Downs, but Serena's Song 
did add $137,500 to her earnings by holding off Urbane, a one-time $50,000 
claimer, at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only the drop of a head beat us in the Breeders' Cup," said Robert Lewis, 
who, with his wife, Beverly, owns Serena's Song. "In both races, this filly's 
shown us what a great heart she has." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Corey-Corey exacta as the jockeys, Nakatani and Black, played their 
cat-and-mouse game all the way to the finish line. Black, who had ridden Urbane 
to victories in her two other starts, claimed that Nakatani had interfered with 
his filly when Serena's Song, from the outside post position, dropped over 
toward the rail going into the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to take more hold of my filly than it looked," Black said. "It cost her 
position and affected how the race set up. He came over and I had to steady 
enough. It cost me a head. That was more than the difference in the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Black went to his whip at the top of the stretch, whereas Nakatani, in the 
lead from the first turn on, never used his stick on Serena's Song. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's unbelievable, the way she's doing things," Nakatani said. "I told Wayne 
before the Breeders' Cup that I thought she could beat Flanders, and she almost 
did from the No. 12 post. I did think the Breeders' Cup might be a little 
strenuous on her, but she had been working well." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanders, who is owned by another of Lukas' major clients, W.T. Young, was 
injured in the Breeders' Cup and, after undergoing surgery one day after the 
race, is recovering in Kentucky. Lukas has no inside information, but his guess 
is that if Flanders wins an Eclipse Award, which she's favored to do, Young 
might retire her for breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 With four victories, two seconds and a third in 10 races, Serena's Song has 
earned $597,335 for the Lewises, who bought her at auction as a yearling for 
$150,000. She paid $2.80 to win Saturday, running 1 1/16 miles in 1:41 4/5, the 
fastest time for the Starlet since it was switched from a mile race in 1991. 
Serena's Song also won the Landaluce Stakes at Hollywood this summer, and her 
only loss in four starts at the track was a second-place finish to the colt Mr 
Purple in the Hollywood Juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 Urbane finished 3 1/2 lengths ahead of Ski Dancer, with Comstock Queen and 
Kindred Soul rounding out the order of finish in the five-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Serena's Song joins Althea and Cuddles as Lukas' Starlet winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other filly came up to our filly with a couple of testing moves down the 
backside," Lukas said. "But Corey (Nakatani) knew where he was at all times. I 
thought he rode a very, very heady race. He didn't have to hit her, which is 
just as well, because she's had a long campaign. But she's held her flesh and 
condition marvelously through it all. She handled the pressure well today." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Brian Mayberry, after winning the Starlet a year ago with Sardula, 
just missed a second consecutive victory in the stake with Urbane, who ran for 
a $50,000 claiming price when she broke her maiden at Santa Anita in October. 
That was double what her owners, the Mace Siegel family, paid for the filly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she ran a great race," Mayberry said Saturday. "Both of those 
horses are natural-born runners." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas will try to sweep the weekend's 2-year-old stakes when he runs Thunder 
Gulch today in the $500,000 Hollywood Futurity. Although Thunder Gulch won the 
Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct in his last start, he is 5-1, behind 3-5 Afternoon 
Deelites and 2-1 The Exeter Man, on the morning line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what we're up against," Lukas said, "but I still like the idea that 
I'm running a horse that's been around two turns and has won a graded stake at 
a mile and an eighth." 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder Gulch was trained by John Kimmel in New York before Lukas, in an 
ownership change, took over for the Remsen. 
</P>
<P>
 After two sprint victories, undefeated Afternoon Deelites will be stretched 
out to 1 1/16 miles. He had a blazing workout last Sunday, going seven furlongs 
in 1:23 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, that was awful fast," said his trainer, Richard Mandella. "It concerns 
me a little, but I look at it this way: I'd rather know that he can run that 
fast than think that he can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the five starters -- The Exeter Man, Thunder Gulch and A.J. Jett -- 
are being supplemented into the race for $25,000 apiece. Supplementaries have 
been successful in the 13 previous editions of the Futurity, with Best Pal, 
King Glorious, Tejano, Snow Chief, Fali Time and Roving Boy winning after not 
being nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In another stake Saturday, Silver Wizard won his second in a row at the meet 
by capturing the Political Ambition Handicap. He was one of six horses winning 
from the No. 1 post for the day and gave Eddie Delahoussaye his third victory. 
. . . Fernando Valenzuela injured his knee when his mount, Don't Read My Lips, 
reared in the starting gate before the second race. Valenzuela took the rest of 
the day off. The filly was scratched by the stewards. . . . Serena's Song will 
be prepared for a Santa Anita campaign as a 3-year-old. . . . Her stablemate, 
Timber Country, the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby, will work for the 
second time at Santa Anita today. Timber Country is back from a rest after 
winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and probably will run three times next year 
in preparation for the Derby. . . . Urbane, supplemented to the Starlet for 
$12,500, earned $50,000. . . . The National Best Seven, a 50-cent bet that 
included Hollywood Park's third race, was worth $17,096.50 for each of the 
three tickets with seven winners. The pool of $109,000 hit a 29-week low.

 * NUISANCE BAR: Upheld a decision of the zoning administrator's office that 
declared El Scorpion, a bar at 4401 W. Pico Blvd., to be a public nuisance, 
which means several corrective measures must be taken within 90 days or the 
business will be forced to close. The bar's owners had appealed the zoning 
administrator's decision. Residents of the nearby Victoria Park neighborhood 
have complained that the bar is a major reason for public drunkenness, 
littering and flagrant drug sales in the area. Police reported that in the past 
two years there have been two murders, two assaults with a deadly weapon, one 
robbery and 11 narcotics arrests at the bar. Among the conditions imposed were 
changing the closing time from 2 a.m. seven days a week to midnight on Friday 
and Saturday and 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday. The bar also must hire a 
state-licensed uniformed security guard, provide 16 off-site parking spaces and 
clean the sidewalks twice a day. The bar's owners were ordered to pay the city 
$4,000 to cover the costs of the failed appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * TOY PARTY: Approved the following street closures today from 6 a.m. to 6 
p.m. for the annual Christmas Toy party sponsored by the Fred Jordan Mission: 
5th Street between San Pedro Street and Gladys Street, Crocker Street between 
4th Street and 6th Street, Towne Avenue between 4th and 6th, and Stanford 
Avenue between 4th and 6th. Each child attending the party will receive two new 
toys, a new sweatshirt and cap, and parents will get a new blanket and three 
grocery bags of food. A spokeswoman for the Fred Jordan Mission said she 
expects 15,000 to 20,000 people to attend the party, which will be highlighted 
by the arrival of Santa Claus in a hot-air balloon at 10 a.m. and Christmas 
play performances by Disney characters at 10:15 a.m., noon and 2 p.m. HOW THEY 
VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * REVITALIZATION STUDY: The Community Redevelopment Agency was 
requested to work with the offices of the 9th and 14th council districts to 
prepare a revitalization strategy for the area roughly bounded by the Los 
Angeles River on the east, Alameda Street on the west, the 10 Freeway on the 
south and 4th Street on the north. The study could result in a formal 
redevelopment plan for the area, much of which is characterized by 
deteriorating streets, graffiti and old, run-down structures. The CRA was 
requested to work with a citizen advisory committee of local tenants, property 
owners, business leaders and community organizations that will be established 
by the 9th and 14th council offices. The 9th District is represented by Rita 
Walters; the 14th by Richard Alatorre. Passed 10-0. Voting yes: Alatorre, Mike 
Hernandez, Jackie Goldberg, Nate Holden, Walters. Absent: Mark Ridley-Thomas, 
Rudy Svorinich Jr. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

CITY ARTS: ROOM AT THE INN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly 60 years, the candlelight procession of Las Posadas has wound its 
way down historic Olvera Street each of the nine days before Christmas, 
depicting the journey of Mary and Joseph as they sought shelter in Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's celebration began Friday, and the traditional Mexican processions 
will continue nightly at 7:30 through Christmas Eve.Activities begin every 
night with dancing and music at 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
 A centuries-old tradition that originated in Mexican villages, Las Posadas -- 
which translates as "the inns" -- -- has been sponsored by Olvera Street 
merchants since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning at the Avila Adobe, the oldest building in Los Angeles, the 
procession consists of adults and children in traditional Mexican costumes 
bearing a large Nativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding candles, they stop at various doors along the street each night, 
singing songs that symbolize Mary and Joseph's fruitless search for lodging.  
</P>
<P>
 Not until Christmas Eve, when two merchants dressed as the couple take the 
place of the Nativity, does someone finally let them in. 
</P>
<P>
 The procession lasts about half an hour. After the ceremony, a pinata is 
broken for children in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the crowds, early arrival is encouraged. There is no charge for 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Olvera Street is within the El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, near 
Los Angeles Street and the Santa Ana Freeway Downtown. Information: (213)

VOICES: A WALL THAT WON'T DIVIDE, BUT WILL HEAL; A LONGTIME EASTSIDE ACTIVIST 
HAS PLANNED A PROJECT TO BRING THE ISSUE OF AIDS AND ITS RISING TOLL AMONG 
LATINOS TO THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE PEOPLE IN HIS COMMUNITY IN A UNIQUE WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Zaldivar, Richard Zaldivar, 41, is executive director of The WallLas 
Memorias, a nonprofit project to build a wall on Los Angeles' Eastside in 
memory of people who have died of AIDS. A related goal is to educate the Latino 
community about the threat of the disease. Zaldivar was interviewed by Berkley 
Hudson. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I had a dream of bringing more awareness about HIV and AIDS to the people I am 
a part of and grew up with. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in El Sereno, went to Catholic school there. At the age of 18 I got 
involved in a political campaign, and started to work for a Los Angeles city 
councilman by age 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, I've been an activist for over 20 years. I know my community well. 
I know that educating the Latino culture about AIDS is not impossible, but it 
has to be molded, has to originate within the community. 
</P>
<P>
 This project occurred to me because I am a recovering alcoholic and because, 
in coming out of the closet as a gay, I realized a lot of my friends were 
HIV-positive or had died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 In many funerals, there are two groups of people in the church. The ones in 
the front, the family, say: "My son died of pneumonia." Then at the back, the 
friends, they say: "He died of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 In my recovery I've dealt with the issue of denial versus reality. I wanted to 
address this. 
</P>
<P>
 As a gay Latino and a recovering alcoholic, I know that you have to accept who 
you are. 
</P>
<P>
 There are just so many people becoming infected in our community, and the 
denial in the Latino community is so strong. I realized that in order for 
education to reach my people, we would need a project to tear down the denial 
and to create a discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 This project creates a comfortable setting for discussion of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 We started in September, 1993. I got a group of people in the community 
together to share the vision. Then I went to community leaders and elected 
officials. I contacted well over 200 people. Ninety-nine percent -- from 
parents at local schools to celebrities such as Culture Clash -- have given a 
positive response. 
</P>
<P>
 We have the involvement of the Catholic Church. I went to an old friend who 
was very interested, Father Juan Santillan. He became chairman of the board of 
our group. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spoken many times of burying people who died of AIDS. He has seen the 
pain, the anguish, the shame of many families. 
</P>
<P>
 In AIDS organizational circles, the Catholic Church is taboo. But I believe 
you cannot restrict involvement of an institution like the Catholic Church and 
then think you are going to create a project for the Latino community. The 
church and religious institutions are part of our culture. 
</P>
<P>
 My board of directors are straight, they're gay, religious, non-religious. 
There are men and women. There are Latinos and non-Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 We are a group of people interested in saving lives and creating a foundation 
for people to heal from the losses of their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 We have many Latino mothers involved who have lost sons to AIDS. There is a 
strong acceptance of this project from them. We have started a support group 
for Latino families who lost relatives to AIDS. It is for those who want to 
share their stories and pain with other families. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall memorial will be built at Lincoln Park. The process of approval has 
begun and we have the support of city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall will be of concrete and colored tile. There will be an amphitheater 
with seating. The design was done by David Angelo, an architect from the 
community who has designed other public monuments in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial is going to have eight panels. Six will contain painted murals 
depicting life with AIDS in the Latino community. Two panels will contain the 
names of 2,000 people who died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The names will be submitted from the community. There is no restriction on 
geographics or ethnicity of the names. If someone has a loved one who died of 
AIDS in Los Angeles and a nephew in Chicago, then we're not going to restrict 
that submission. 
</P>
<P>
 We're trying to raise $350,000 to construct the wall and provide for AIDS 
education as we build it. The money will come through community fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not about building a wall to idolize people who died of AIDS. We are 
doing it for healing, for acceptance, for breaking down denial. Most important 
is to empower the community to take on the issue of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to be respectful of people's feelings and religious beliefs and 
attitudes -- without compromising the goal of our project. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, we had 60 people marching in the Mexican Independence Day 
parade. It was the first AIDS group ever to march in that parade. It was one of 
the most powerful moments of this project. It was televised on Channel 34, on 
Spanish television.  
</P>
<P>
 In the last six years, the highest increase of AIDS in Los Angeles has been 
among Latino women at 168%. Latino women represent 31.6% of the total female 
AIDS cases in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino males had an increase of 95% in the last six years. As of September, 
they are 23.5% of the male cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the children infected in Los Angeles County, almost 45% are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why this project is so necessary. We need to be able to say that AIDS 
can affect anyone.

VOICES: SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A.'S SMALL MIRACLE; AT 5-FOOT-7, MARK MCMILLIAN BEATS 
THE ODDS TO BECOME A STARTING DEFENSIVE BACK IN THE NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK MCMILLIAN, Mark McMillian, 24, was born and raised in South-Central. 
McMillian is a starting defensive back for the Philadelphia Eagles, and at 
5-feet-7, one of the smallest starters in the National Football League. He did 
not begin playing organized football until he was a senior at Granada Hills' 
Kennedy High School. He was a Junior College All-American at Glendale College 
before receiving a scholarship to Alabama. The Eagles selected McMillian in the 
10th round in the 1992 draft and he quickly moved from the special teams to the 
starting lineup in his second season. McMillian says he would like to be a role 
model for inner-city youths, but because he attended a high school in the 
Valley, he rarely is asked to speak at local school functions or charity 
meetings. He hopes to bring his message of working hard to achieve one's goals 
back to South-Central, which he considers home. McMillian was interviewed by 
Sean Waters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I remember the goal of parents once was to see their son reach 18 and graduate 
from high school and go on from there. Today, it's to see your son reach 25 
alive. That's a milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs and violence are out of control and it's only getting bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 There was this incident four years ago when three of my friends from 
South-Central got shot, and two died. I was at Alabama at the time. If I 
(hadn't been going to school there), I would have been with those friends, and 
it could have been me. 
</P>
<P>
 (Another incident) I remember, I shipped three big boxes to my old house in 
South-Central, and I was told that the police came by because they thought I 
was shipping drugs. That's the perception we have to live with. 
</P>
<P>
 We have to get over that mentality. We need to move forward or we haven't 
accomplished much of anything since the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 When I come back to visit, I don't see much activity in the neighborhood. The 
parks are still there, but they don't have the funds for football or basketball 
leagues. During the riots, a lot (of businesses) burned down. . . . I remember 
a liquor store in the middle of the area where everyone used to hang out. But 
it's gone. Now everyone has to drive to get milk or stuff. It doesn't take a 
year or two to build a new liquor store. The community can be cleaned up a lot 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 I look at kids today. They have a choice to either get a part-time job . . . 
and work their way up, or be a runner and sell drugs. What do you think they're 
going to choose? They're going to choose the big wad of money. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to reach out to the kids. The people who you share with now will be 
the same people that share with you when they succeed. It takes a lot of 
patience, but we need to guide kids today. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you're an elder male or a teacher, you need to play a bigger role 
today. Teachers should show more love and concern. 
</P>
<P>
 I was talking to (teammate and defensive back) Eric Allen and he agreed that 
you (can) take the kid out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of 
the kid. If all you know is the community that you live in, then that's where 
you should stay and help to try to make it a better place. Too much is made of 
the Hollywood lifestyle and living in Bel-Air and Beverly Hills. I want to put 
time and effort back into the community and help the young kids discover a 
better way to live. You can't give them the things they should have, but you 
can teach them how to get it for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 I know it helps every Saturday or Sunday (for me) to be out there on the 
playing field, because someone is off the streets watching me on TV. I call 
back home and let people know that I'm not too big to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I'm reaching out to other athletes and other people who can serve as role 
models. I tell them, go to charity functions at the schools and at the parks. 
Let the kids know you are out there. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to see more role models of today. It was nice to see Magic Johnson do 
a lot of community work when he was with the Lakers. Now someone else has to 
step forward. I'm one of the rising stars and I know a lot of people are 
wondering what I'm doing. Well, I want more opportunities to speak to more 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 A person like me or (Dallas Cowboys defensive back and former Jordan High 
star) James Washington who makes the big time should be treated like role 
models, and big-time papers should focus on us. We might not be able to reach 
out to all the kids, but maybe one or two can see what I've accomplished and 
will try harder. I'm considered the smallest starting player in the NFL. I 
can't tell you not to do this or that, but I can tell you to reach for your 
dreams, because anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 I know it's hard to grow up in the city. People told me to stay away from 
drugs, stay in school and listen to teachers and everything will be all right. 
But as a teen-ager I didn't always listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that I've made it to the NFL, I realize how much that advice really helped 
me out. So I tell kids the same thing: Stay in school and stay away from the 
drugs.

CRENSHAW REFLECTS ON BITTER END; FOOTBALL: THE TEAM WAS ONE GAME AWAY FROM 
ERASING SOME OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN IT AND THE SCHOOL'S VAUNTED BASKETBALL 
PROGRAM. MAYBE NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILL ETHERIDGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crenshaw High's football team made strides in coming out of the shadow of the 
school's acclaimed basketball program this season, but in the end, the Cougars 
had to settle for second place on the field and in the hearts of Crenshaw fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar beat Crenshaw, 38-6, in the City Section 4-A Championship game at El 
Camino College Dec. 10 before a small crowd of 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Brandon Seals scored on a fourth-down run from the five-yard line 
to bring Crenshaw within one at 7-6. But that was as close as the Cougars would 
come, as Sylmar reeled off 31 consecutive points, including a late field goal 
that left Crenshaw coach Robert Garrett grumbling after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Crenshaw (12-2) gained some respect for their runner-up finish in the 
City Section 4-A playoffs, the football program at Crenshaw may never be able 
to step out of the shadow of California's most successful high school 
basketball program over the past 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the sparse support at the football game, the school gym was 
packed two days earlier for a nonleague showdown between defending City and 
State champion Crenshaw and Santa Ana Valley, which brought along Orange County 
stars Olujima Mann and Ike Harmon. Crenshaw prevailed, 88-80. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw's basketball team has won 13 4-A City titles and six State Division I 
titles since Willie West began coaching in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The football team won its only championship in 1991, a 27-7 win over 
Chatsworth in the 3-A title game. 
</P>
<P>
 But assistant athletic director Juanita Walker-Deckard insists the football 
program's success cannot be measured in victories alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a strong football program," she said. "The coaches are very caring, 
making sure that academics is stressed. No player was lost off this year's 
football team due to ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a resurgence of football among the young people living in our 
neighborhood, who are now staying in the neighborhood. They were going to 
Westchester and Palisades and some of the schools in the valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Moss Benmosche pointed out that football attendance grew 
over previous years during this year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although playing in the talent-rich Southern Pacific Conference with powers 
Carson, Banning and Dorsey will make it tough for the Cougars to get another 
shot at a title next year, there's reason to hope: The Cougars return 27 
underclassmen next season, including quarterback Ricky Lumford, running back 
Anthony Lowrance and lineman Earl Lillie.

Pacific Open basketball Tournament.

53 points in the second half. 
</P>

GIRLS BASKETBALL; BATTLE-TOUGHENED WASHINGTON BEATS MORNINGSIDE TO END SKID 
</P>

<P>
 The Washington High girls' basketball team has competed against the best among 
the City and Southern Section. And it's only December. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington defeated perennial Southern Section power Morningside, 54-45, in an 
intersectional game Tuesday at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended a two-game losing streak for the Generals, who have lost by 
one point to Lynwood, the State Division I runner-up, on a last-second shot and 
by five points to two-time defending City 4-A champion Crenshaw in the 
Washington tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
 On tap this week is the prestigious Tournament of Champions in Santa Barbara 
on Tuesday featuring many of the top teams on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't change a thing if I had to redo the schedule," Washington Coach 
Julie Rousseau said. "We're building toward the postseason and these are the 
game situations you need to be prepared for." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward Kanisha Best agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a challenge playing teams of high caliber," Best said. "It helps us stay 
hungry and concentrate. We know what we can do against good teams when we need 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 The Generals were able to overcome a shaky first half -- and a season-high 40 
turnovers -- Tuesday against Morningside, winner of five Southern Section 
titles in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which made only two field goals in the first 14 minutes, had only 
four points on free throws until Jackie Lauderdale scored the Generals' first 
basket on a jump shot with a little more than two minutes left in the first 
quarter. The Generals did not make another basket until two minutes before 
halftime while the Monarchs raced to a 21-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, however, finished the half scoring 11 points during a two-minute 
span to close to 21-20 at halftime. The spurt was part of a 23-2 run which 
helped the Generals open a 34-25 lead midway through the third quarter and take 
the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Best had 10 of her career-high 24 points during the surge. She made eight of 
13 shots from the field and also had seven rebounds. Lareishia Findley had 10 
points and five blocks and Tina Greer contributed six steals and five assists. 
</P>

 BEARING DOWN: Rams countdown to St. Louis: Two games left? The Rams -- hurting 
statistically on both offense and defense -- are trying to break a five-game 
losing streak against the Bears in Chicago today (C11) . . . Actually, some in 
Los Angeles may want the Bears to play well. A Chicago baking company donates 
one case of brownies for each Bear touchdown to a different children's hospital 
each week. This week's recipient is L.A.'s Childrens Hospital.

 SKIPPING TOWN? Somebody forgot to tell the whales that Orange County isn't a 
popular place right now. Whale-watching season is on, and ocean buffs have seen 
more than one whale each of the last few days lumbering down the coast in 
search of Baja's warmer waters. . . . Dana Point Sportfishing has started daily 
whale boat runs at 10, noon, and 2 ($12 adults, $7 for small children). Newport 
Landing Sportfishing starts whale runs Dec. 26.

 REINVENTING NATURE: You can't build a house in a hollowed-out rock -- like 
architect Brion S. Jeannette is doing at Aliso Beach (E1) -- without facing a 
few problems. Such as: replanting the original coastal sage scrub on top of the 
rock at the project's finish. . . . Says Jeannette, who must duplicate the 
rock's original drainage pattern: "If our drainage retains too much rain water, 
the plants will grow too much and the rock will look like a Chia pet."

 SANTA IN SYDNEY: When do you send your kids away for Christmas? When they have 
a chance to spend the holidays playing baseball in Australia. Seattle Mariners 
scout Myron Pines, who lives and teaches in Garden Grove, is taking a group of 
30 teen-age boys to Australia this week for an 18-and-under tournament. . . . 
Each is paying his own way. Pines, who hopes he has enough adult escorts, 
suggests: "With it being Christmas, we think the boys will probably be on 
pretty good behavior. They're all certainly excited."

YAO YILIN; EX-VICE PREMIER OF CHINA, CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yao Yilin, 77, a former vice premier and a conservative economist who helped 
launch China's market-oriented reforms. Yao disappeared from view for months in 
1991, reportedly because of an illness, and had not been seen in public since 
he retired from his last official post in 1992.Yao was associated with China's 
periods of economic retrenchment since it embarked on market-oriented economic 
reforms in 1979. He was a prominent figure in 1989, when reforms were rolled 
back after a military crackdown on the democracy movement. Yao worked closely 
with Premier Li Peng, whom he had mentored and who also is an economic 
conservative, but reportedly was forced to resign in 1992 for being too 
narrow-minded. Born in 1917 in the poor eastern China province of Anhui, Yao 
joined the Communist Party in 1935 and was a student activist at Beijing's 
Qinghua University, the nation's top technical school. During the 1937-1945 war 
against Japan, he served as a regional party official. After the Communist 
takeover in 1949, Yao worked in the trade ministry and was named minister of 
commerce in 1960. He was purged during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, but 
recovered his former post in 1978. The following year, he was named vice 
premier. On Dec. 11 in Beijing.

STILL AN ANGEL IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE; FORMER BASEBALL STAR ROD CAREW GOES TO 
BAT FOR SHELTER SERVING VICTIMS OF ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tip of the baseball cap to former Angels' star hitter Rod Carew, who has 
gone to bat for a shelter for abused women and children in affluent Anaheim 
Hills, where he lives. The shelter, Eli Home, eventually won city approval, but 
not before being granted a shabby welcome from some other residents who were 
opposed to it.  
</P>
<P>
 Carew learned of the shelter from newly elected Anaheim City Councilman Bob 
Zemel, who was aware that Carew had been beaten as a boy and had run away from 
home. Carew was able to address the importance of having havens for victims of 
abuse from personal experience, saying, "You always deal with (the abuse). But 
the only way to improve is to get it out. I just hope someday when these kids 
grow up they say, 'God, I'm glad the Eli Home was there.' " Possessing 
firsthand experience, Carew has come to the defense of the shelter, which 
annually provides emergency housing and counseling to about 1,000 abuse 
victims. This weekend, he was to attend a Christmas party for 200 children, and 
says he will remain involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a high-profile celebrity to come to the defense of an important group 
like this can go a long way. In approving the facility, the City Council said 
it would review the shelter in one year and could revoke the permit if the 
facility proves to be an unwelcome neighbor. One of the "Not In My Back Yard" 
arguments raised by critics was that the shelter could attract violent spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Having Carew say he will stand by the facility will be important to protect it 
from falling victim to politics. As Lori Galloway, executive director of the 
Eli Home said, "People really respect Carew, and if he shows his support for 
our programs, then they pay a lot more attention." 
</P>
<P>
 By his involvement, the great hitter has shown that he has not forgotten those 
who, like him, have experienced the terrors of being abused women and children.

DON'T BE TOO QUICK TO CRANK UP B-2; PRODUCTION COSTS FOR THE STEALTH BOMBER AND 
ITS 'SILVER BULLET' COULD BE ENORMOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the years, during the many debates over the merits of the B-2 Stealth 
bomber, there has been one constant: The arguments have been surprisingly 
nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
 During the governor's race, for example, Kathleen Brown voiced her support for 
the continuation of production of the B-2, which is built in Pico Rivera and 
Palmdale. That led to a quick reaction by the campaign offices of Pete Wilson, 
who said that the governor has been one of the aircraft's staunchest 
supporters. Some of the strategic bomber's best friends in Congress have been 
Democrats, including powerful Sens. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Daniel Inouye 
(D-Hawaii). 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, during the last presidential race, the B-2 was not a political issue 
at all. Both the Republican incumbent, George Bush, and the eventual winner, 
Bill Clinton, said during the campaign that they would go no further than the 
current order of a fleet of 20 of the radar-eluding planes. We must note here 
that we agreed. In 1992, we said that President Bush's scaling back of the 
enormously costly B-2 program and other nuclear weapons programs amounted to a 
significant contribution to world peace. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we were a little surprised over the sudden gush of optimism about the 
B-2's production prospects that were generated by two recent events. The first 
was the Republican takeover of both houses of Congress, which led B-2 defense 
contractor Northrop Grumman to offer to sell the government 20 more Stealths at 
a fixed price of $11.4 billion. The second event was the addition of Rep. 
Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) to the House National Security 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Crank up B-2 production? Not so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few other matters to take into account. One is the Pentagon's 
cancellation, just this month, of Northrop Grumman's $13.3-billion advanced 
stealth missile program. The missile had been planned as a "silver bullet" to 
be carried by -- you guessed it -- the Stealth bomber. The Pentagon and Deputy 
Defense Secretary John Deutch said that the missile's development delays and 
skyrocketing costs had made it "too expensive a silver bullet." 
</P>
<P>
 And in September, a congressional study of the bomber by the General 
Accounting Office contained an important warning. Testing delays and problems 
with the B-2's radar-evading technology, its terrain avoidance radar and its 
computer software were threatening to raise the costs of the first 20 bombers 
beyond a government-imposed ceiling of $44.4 billion . 
</P>
<P>
 We suggest that these recent disclosures will figure as heavily, if not more 
so, in any talk of refueling the B-2 production line. Hold the champagne.

COUNTY BANKRUPTCY PROMPTS ADVICE, ENCOURAGEMENT, RECRIMINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the Orange County bankruptcy: Why are we now trying to blame 
everyone in sight and get help from the state and federal governments? Contrary 
to our self-reliant, less-government, conservative image, we are whining like a 
bunch of spoiled children. Hindsight is always better. So we gambled and lost. 
And I stress "we." Ultimately, we as citizens are partly responsible for this. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no investment oversight committee. We should have learned that 
lesson from the Newport-Mesa Unified School District when (an official) who had 
sole control of their finances embezzled $34 million a few years ago. I hope 
other cities and counties can learn from our misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 We should impose a temporary tax, earmarked only for replacement of the lost 
money. Make sure the tax money is used only for that purpose and cannot be 
continued after the correct amount has been raised. There is no shame in making 
an error in judgment as we have. The shame is in whining for everyone else to 
fix it for us. To all who have been preaching "personal responsibility," the 
time is now.

 * This is in regard to The Times' articles on the Orange County bankruptcy. A 
copy of the 1992 auditor-controller's report on Treasurer-Tax Collector (Robert 
L.) Citron's office was sent to the Orange County district attorney's office in 
1993. Last week, Dist. Atty. (Michael R.) Capizzi stated, in effect, in a Times 
story that his office took no action because any violations that may have been 
committed by the treasurer's office would be civil, not criminal, in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 13 Times states that the federal government is now investigating the 
possibility of mail or wire fraud as related to the Orange County investments. 
Didn't Capizzi see the possibility of mail or wire fraud and the necessity of 
notifying the federal government?

 * Being a student at Corona del Mar High School, I felt isolated from the 
effects of Orange County filing for bankruptcy because it never occurred to me 
that my education may be on the line. But as days progressed the situation 
became worse. The teachers and many social workers have not been guaranteed 
their paychecks after December. I then learned about San Jose High School, 
which declared bankruptcy a couple years ago. The school closed for a month and 
almost all of the teachers were furloughed and all the elective classes cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Here at Corona del Mar High we have an excellent journalism class, which I 
understand would be one the first things cut. My education is crucial to me and 
ultimately to the United States! I resent that my education should be taken 
away from me because somebody had a bad day on Wall Street!

 * I am writing to express my regret for the remarks I made regarding the 
Orange County supervisors and my statement that they should consider resigning 
because of the current fiscal crisis. During my two years on the Santa Ana City 
Council, I have worked hard to improve the lives of Santa Ana residents. I know 
that the Orange County Board of Supervisors is equally concerned about county 
residents, and believe that they have the best interest of these residents at 
heart. The supervisors have my support and confidence in their efforts to 
straighten out this situation.

 * I believe that your coverage of the "Orange County problem" needs to be seen 
in a more historical context. Some of the "blame" that is being spread around 
needs to be shared by the citizens and taxpayers of this county and state which 
so joyously passed the famous Proposition 13 some years back. This "meat ax" 
approach to tax policy has come back to haunt us. 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened is that we tied the hands of our local officials to raise 
money to carry out our wishes. At the same time, we did not decrease our 
demands on those officials to deliver increased quantities and qualities of 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been a situation where an apparently public-spirited official 
has "gambled" with our inadequate tax dollars in an attempt to deliver the 
services that we the public have demanded but have been unwilling to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 We are as guilty as he is in this situation.

 * Our children came home from school with a note from their principal 
indicating that they would not be moving from their temporary location to their 
newly built school on Jan. 3, because of the Orange County financial disaster. 
The children of Foothill Ranch Elementary School, along with many enthusiastic 
parents and local businesses, have been planning opening day ceremonies for 
several months. The children have picked their school colors and mascot; the 
school stands beautiful and ready. Our children told us that their teachers' 
eyes filled with tears while trying to explain why they wouldn't be packing up 
the classrooms after all.  
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback School District is just one of many that is reeling from the 
current financial crisis. According to the note from school, the district does 
not have the funds available to pay the operating costs for the new school and 
the move is on hold indefinitely.

 * I fail to understand why Robert Citron appears to be given the full blame 
for the poor investments and big losses of the county. According to reports, 
the Board of Supervisors approved each investment made by Mr. Citron. 
Admittedly, Mr. Citron is at fault for using poor judgment, but the board 
members were the ones who made the final decisions about each investment. Is it 
fair that Mr. Citron was pressured into retiring on his nice pension while the 
members of the Board of Supervisors continue to receive their $82,500 per year 
plus extra pay for meetings and lucrative car allowances? 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that they start cutting county expenses by setting an example and 
giving themselves a pay cut of at least 65%. Maybe the citizens should do as 
the citizens in one California county did. They used the initiative process to 
set their county supervisors' pay at $30,000 per year.

 * In spite of the sad state of affairs in Orange County government, 
recriminations and finger-pointing will only exacerbate the immediate problem. 
Getting the county off the hook helps us all in the long run. What we need now 
is positive community action to solve the problem. Here is one way to help the 
county and ourselves at the same time: 
</P>
<P>
 Pay the second property tax installment now. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will receive a much needed infusion of cash, and individuals and 
corporations will profit through an extra tax deduction in 1994. Here's how it 
works: 
</P>
<P>
 The second installment of property taxes is due Feb. 1, and delinquent April 
10. By paying this installment now, you can profit through the income tax 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming a minimum income tax rate of 20%, for each $1,000 of property tax 
paid in 1994, a direct savings of $200 in 1994 income tax can be achieved. (For 
higher tax brackets the savings will be even greater.) 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, waiting until 1995 to pay these taxes may carry substantial hidden costs 
for the average taxpayer. First, by waiting to pay the property tax in March, 
1995, income tax benefits will not be received until 1996. Second, considering 
the fact that a federal tax cut is likely next year, the value of any property 
tax deduction will be lowered by the amount each tax bracket is lowered. 
</P>
<P>
 So, maybe paying property taxes isn't so bad after all -- providing the county 
uses the money wisely!

years. Few listened. Now we learn about disastrous decisions no one claims to

</P>
<P>
 We see just how unresponsive to Orange County (residents) in all their 
diversity most elected and appointed officials are. Everyone is witness to a 
bankruptcy of leadership and responsibility. Only too ready to punish loyal 
rank-and-file public workers with wage freezes and layoffs, officials book a 
carnival of expensive consultants and lawyers to keep the punishment from 
reaching themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 We must take protective initiatives: an exhaustive federal investigation and 
oversight by state and federal authorities that can override mismanagement.

locally, yes, but remember: We are not just residents of a single city -- we

 * Orange County's pending bankruptcy has an ominous parallel to Orange County 
homeowner associations' fiscal problems. The state Legislature has not only 
been busy during the past few years expanding the fiscal authority of counties, 
which has directly contributed to the bankruptcy, it has also been busy 
expanding authority of homeowner associations to spend money collected for 
reserves on non-repair capital improvement expenses -- like attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Orange County, an alarming number of homeowner associations are teetering 
on bankruptcy. Will the Legislature respond to the county crisis in the same 
way it responded to the homeowner associations' fiscal crisis, that is, by 
requiring that monies be replenished within 12 months and then authorizing 
homeowner associations to pass unlimited special assessments on the homeowners? 
Since Marian Bergeson was a major player in passing the legislation affecting 
homeowner associations, it will be interesting to see if she advocates the same 
remedy for Orange County, and if (she) gets a taste of reality: Too much 
regulation is not good; not enough regulation can be devastating.

 * It is time for county, school district and city governments to do what 
private industry always must do during bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings: 
Redefine essential priorities and then lay off surplus employees under the new 
definition, and roll back wages, benefits and retirement plans of all remaining 
employees. Any senior staff employee who makes over $70,000 to $80,000 per year 
should have their wages above that amount reduced at three times the rate of 
the rank-and-file employees. Just as a company which is in bankruptcy 
reorganization cannot ask stockholders to fork over for management's gross 
errors, neither should our local and county elected officials expect the 
taxpayers to cover for their collective gross incompetence.

 * As a longtime employee of the Garden Grove Unified School District and 
resident of Orange County, I have to say that I am furious and disgusted with 
the bureaucracy in which I live. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove is probably one of the most fiscally conservative districts in 
the county if not the state. Yet, because of state law, their money is at the 
county office in the commingled pool. As the Orange County financial debacle 
continues to unfold, it is uncertain what the ramifications will be to my 
district as well as 26 others that merely followed the law. It would appear 
that districts like mine, whose only risk was to follow the law, will be 
punished. The same state Legislature that makes the laws seems to be turning 
its back on the 27 law-abiding school districts. These districts were not 
greedy investors looking for a quick win. They were merely doing what they were 
required to do. They should be helped, not punished.

THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF NOISY AIRPORT; FLIGHTS OVER BURBANK MAY GIVE 
RESIDENTS HEADACHES, BUT THEY ALSO STIMULATE LOCAL ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have a few messages for those who run the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena 
Airport, and for those neighbors who are so fed up with the noise generated by 
its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us are well-acquainted with the pitfalls of living near an airport: 
having to turn up the volume on your television set so that flight noise won't 
obliterate a vital piece of dialogue; asking the person on the other end of the 
telephone to repeat what was just said; settling in for that one morning of the 
weekend in which you are able to sleep late, only to wind up counting takeoffs 
instead of sheep, and wondering whether the rookie performing touch-and-go 
practices is going to wind up as a roof ornament. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Burbank Airport has tried to be a better neighbor. It was the 
first to shift to quieter aircraft. It also has a 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. flight 
curfew. But the roar of aircraft can seem to be an unforgivable intrusion. That 
is why we would urge the Airport Authority to make certain that it has done all 
that it can to reduce the noise associated with each takeoff. But there are 
other realities. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that the airport has won another round in court. Judge Robert H. 
O'Brien has ruled that airport officials complied with state law in the manner 
in which they carried out an environmental impact report. That amounts to a 
major victory in the airport's efforts to build a new and larger terminal that 
will accommodate as many as 10 million passengers annually by 2010. We think 
that new terminal should go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport is not just a local resource, but a regional one. It continues 
to grow in terms of flight operations because more and more people want to take 
advantage of the option. Its steady contribution to the local economy, in terms 
of jobs and dollars spent, has been a boon during tough recessionary times. 
That fact won't reduce the decibels, but it might increase your tolerance of 
them. We hope so.

BEWARE THOSE CONS IN CHARITY'S CLOTHING; INVESTIGATE TO MAKE SURE YOUR HOLIDAY 
GOODWILL REACHES ITS INTENDED DESTINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the better aspects of the holiday season is the impulse to give, not 
necessarily another tie for a father or a toy for a child but money in the 
Salvation Army bell ringer's bucket and a few cans of food in the collection 
barrel at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the charitable feelings out there during the season are no 
secret to the con artists either. Warnings to be sure money given by people in 
Orange County goes as intended have been appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen McGlinn, director of the Costa Mesa-based charity Share Our Selves, said 
one man recently set up shop in front of a grocery store and solicited 
contributions he said would go to SOS. As McGlinn correctly noted, agencies 
like hers cannot know who may be out there using their names. But there are 
precautions that should be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Charitable organizations recommend not giving money to door-to-door 
solicitors. Ask for an envelope and an address so the donation can be mailed. 
Telephone the organization and see if the solicitor really represented it. If 
you haven't heard of the group, check with the county Better Business Bureau or 
the National Charities Information Bureau in New York. In addition, the state 
attorney general's office maintains a list of charities that have registered in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County long has had the unfortunate title of telephone fraud capital of 
the nation. The scam artists know many residents are wealthy, and the warm 
weather and amenities are as attractive to criminals as to the law-abiding. The 
Orange County district attorney's office said most complaints it received about 
consumer fraud stem from telephone solicitors fraudulently claiming to 
represent legitimate groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes hustlers dial for dollars from the unwary by using names similar to 
those of reputable organizations. The more brazen ask that gifts be made in 
cash, and offer to send someone over to pick it up. Ask for information in 
writing, and when it arrives, check for a listing of what percentage of the 
funds are used for programs and services, and what percentage for fund-raising 
and administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has had a good record of helping charities, though in recent 
years it has been more difficult because of the recession and job losses, 
including some at corporations that were major benefactors of groups helping 
the needy. The desire to help out is noble at any time of year, but it 
unfortunately requires caution to make sure that dollars reach their intended 
destination.

CONSERVANCY SHOULD KEEP ITS FOCUS LOCAL; PURCHASE AT WILSON CANYON STRAINS 
AGENCY'S RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's possible for Wilson Canyon to appear as though it is close to the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. It just requires a really small map. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Canyon is north of Sylmar, which is in the northernmost regions of the 
rather sizable San Fernando Valley. That puts it one heckuva lot closer to the 
Santa Susana and San Gabriel mountains than it does to the Santa Monicas. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is south of 
the Ventura Freeway in the Valley, running east from Point Mugu State Park in 
Ventura County to Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The geography lesson is necessary because of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy's recent announcement of an agreement to purchase 246 acres of 
mountainous land at Wilson Canyon for about $3.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This preserves as open space a parcel of land that is considered a critical 
segment of the proposed Rim of the Valley trail system. We suppose that's so. 
And the purchase was hailed by the likes of Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) 
as proof that "there is open space in the northeast Valley that is worth 
purchasing as much as in the Santa Monica Mountains." We suppose that could be 
true, too. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem is that the Mountains Conservancy's future buying power, which 
has already dropped considerably from the salad days of 1989 to 1993, figures 
to plummet further still in the newly retooled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is also that there is still much to do in terms of acquiring land 
rights in the Santa Monicas, which is the conservancy's principal mandate. The 
conservancy has an increasingly expensive legal battle with Soka University 
over some of that land. Other conservancy efforts are also rather far afield -- 
although the conservancy doesn't seem to think this is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this means that there will be less for the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area proper, and even less, if any, for land that is not at 
least remotely close to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) -- the recreation area's best 
friend on Capitol Hill -- was returned to the Congress. But he figures to have 
less clout in a Republican-controlled House and Senate, and the Santa Monicas 
figure to be pretty far down the new leadership's money list. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Times Staff Writer Jon D. Markman reports that a dozen residential 
development companies have made plans to create or complete major home projects 
in the Santa Monicas. Much of the land that figures in the new development 
boom, which has now been joined by individual property owners, is perched on 
the ridgelines between Griffith Park and Woodland Hills. These are places that 
the conservancy has an interest in purchasing. Will it be able to compete? 
</P>
<P>
 And if the conservancy needed another sign of how little there may be for 
purchasing in the future, it certainly had to look no farther than Gov. 
Wilson's veto, this past July, of more than $7 million for funding and programs 
outside the mountain ranges rimming the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the conservancy had been criticized for its attempts to purchase a 
780-acre parcel of land in Santa Barbara's Santa Ynez Valley, and a 546-acre 
parcel between the San Gabriel Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 In its defense, the conservancy has argued that the region will be left with a 
biological island if it only focuses on the Santa Monica Mountains. That is an 
environmentally noble sentiment. The money crunch is the reality, however. It 
means, unfortunately, that there will be fewer Wilson Canyons to applaud and 
more of a need to restrict purchases to the Santa Monica Mountains and its 
immediate environs.

BETTER SCHOOLS AREN'T BUILT ON PRAYER ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By placing Andrea Hecht's critique of school prayer ("Private Matter of Prayer 
Just Doesn't Fit in Public Schools," Dec. 11) next to Joyce Sunila's expression 
about violence and other problems in Valley schools ("Count Parent's Confidence 
Among the Fatalities"), The Times did us all a favor by highlighting the key 
educational question before us: Where should we focus our resources in making 
schools the foundation for our communities? 
</P>
<P>
 If the Radical Right has its way, the answer is in school prayer. But this 
will lead only to further splintering and divisiveness in our school system and 
will do nothing to solve the real problems that Sunila addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Jewish Congress believes that if we really want to deal with 
serious educational issues, we should focus our energies on keeping weapons out 
of the hands of schoolchildren, on improving school infrastructures (Sunila and 
her neighbors are working hard just to keep the neighborhood school building 
looking decent), and on improving teacher resources. By making public schools 
an integral and strong part of our communities, with much to offer children, we 
will show the next generation what values we truly stand for.

<P>
 I do not, however, believe that the students who do not want to pray should be 
ejected from their classrooms while they do it. 
</P>
<P>
 So what I propose is this: Let the praying students take their gods, guardian 
angels, goblins, gremlins, ghosts, devils, witches, sorcerers and magicians and 
leave the classrooms to go stand in a snow drift someplace while they practice 
their illusions of superiority, their indifference to reason, and whatever 
other superstitious nonsense their anxieties and imaginations may conjure.

 Meanwhile, the sensible students can simply get on with their education.

ELSMERE CANYON PACT EASES COUNTY TRASH CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to an article appearing in the (Nov. 27) Valley Commentary section 
of your newspaper from Mr. George Pederson, mayor of the city of Santa Clarita, 
I wish to offer the following information to clarify statements made which I 
believe are either incorrect or misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Mr. Pederson states that the Los Angeles County trash crisis will be 
hastened by the approval of the agreement, which would remove the city of Los 
Angeles' use restriction from the Sunshine Canyon Landfill expansion's land use 
permit. Contrary to Mr. Pederson's claims, the agreement will expedite the 
availability of needed disposal capacity by removing current and future city 
litigation which could further delay the project so that the trash crisis 
becomes a reality before the landfill is operational. Although this action may 
be considered by some to relieve the city's responsibility for utilizing 
landfill space within its jurisdiction, the county intends to continue with its 
efforts to encourage the city to assume this responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the board's approval of the agreement, which authorizes the 
performance of feasibility studies and preliminary design of a freeway 
interchange to provide access to the proposed Elsmere Canyon Landfill, in no 
way constitutes or implies any current county approval of the construction of 
the interchange or the landfill. The willingness of BKK Corp., the project 
applicant, to finance the cost of these studies does not in any way obligate 
the Board of Supervisors to approve the landfill project. The county's interest 
in approving this agreement stems from the realization that the environmental 
review, design and construction of the interchange project would in itself be 
an extremely long process which would take years to complete. By approving this 
interchange agreement, the Board of Supervisors is avoiding potentially costly 
delays in the development of the project should the landfill's proponent 
demonstrate that the site is environmentally sound and technically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, Mr. Pederson's concerns on the impact of the Elsmere Landfill of 
wildlife and ground water supplies will be addressed in the project's 
environmental impact report. I believe it is premature to take a position prior 
to completion of the environmental impact report.

LAPD: WAKE UP AND GO AFTER REAL CRIMINALS

 Re: " 'Holiday Surprise' Targets Car Burglars" (Dec. 7), let me get this 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department assigns 12 officers to spend the day in a 
parking lot trying to entice some poor shlub into stealing a package from an 
unattended convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the murder and mayhem in the crime-ridden San Fernando Valley, isn't 
there a better way for these officers to serve the public than by manufacturing 
a petty theft? LAPD, wake up and smell the drug deals.

LET OWNERS REBUILD JUST WHAT WAS DAMAGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary Squier (Letters, Dec. 11) attempts to defend his department by accusing 
me of misrepresenting the city's Earthquake Emergency Loan Program in my Valley 
Commentary article of Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his position as general manager of the L.A. Housing Department, I 
would urge Mr. Squier to become more familiar with his own Earthquake Emergency 
Program.Under the guise of "affordable housing," this city department has been 
promoting a densification that will destroy the infrastructure of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic idea behind the program is to assist owners of earthquake-damaged 
properties, as well as property owners who failed to receive help from the 
federal government. Unfortunately, the city's plan will only result in an 
increase of low-income housing because it offers owners of earthquake-damaged 
apartments a zero interest-rate loan, but only if 40% of the units rebuilt will 
fall within the "low-income" category. What apartment owner would refuse this 
type of program? This will do nothing more than create a vehicle for the 
crowding of low-income housing into areas where none existed before. I fully 
agree with the statement made by Councilman Hal Bernson -- and that is, "The 
purpose of this money was to help rebuild buildings -- it was not intended for 
social engineering." 
</P>
<P>
 If the city truly wanted to assist those who couldn't qualify for federal 
assistance, a legitimate program would be one that allows those property owners 
to rebuild and replace only what was damaged by the earthquake, without any 
strings attached.

FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS ADD TO LAKE MANOR ALLURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regard to the article about the Chatsworth Lake Manor area (Dec. 5): You 
seem to have captured the allure of our community, namely, that it is the 
antithesis of Simi Valley. However, you missed another point.The "we keep to 
ourselves" remark doesn't quite fit. 
</P>
<P>
 In all the places I've lived (nine addresses, three states, two coasts), the 
neighbors here are by far the friendliest. People smile and wave when they see 
each other as a matter of rule rather than exception. We actually go to each 
other's houses to talk instead of phoning. Last Jan. 17 especially, everyone 
was outside as quickly as possible to check on one another to make sure we were 
all OK. 
</P>
<P>
 The only folks we don't like to have around are the individuals whose sole 
interaction with us is the use of Lake Manor Drive twice a day for commuting. 
Many of these individuals insist on speeding 50 m.p.h. on a 25-m.p.h. road with 
blind turns, blind hills and blind side streets. I routinely get passed by or 
honked at by commuters when I'm doing 5 or 10 miles over the speed limit.

HUB-AND-SPOKE ROUTING WON'T HELP BUS SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is to voice my strong disagreement with your Dec. 4 editorial that 
supported the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's efforts to redesign the 
San Fernando Valley bus line routing to fit a hub-and-spoke motif. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, the Valley is laid out in an almost-perfect grid.Were the bus 
lines routed correctly and the scheduling done properly, none of the problems 
you noted would exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Hub-and-spoke would not be an improvement over the present system. A number of 
lines will be taken out of service, displacing many riders and causing them to 
leave earlier for work and arrive home much later. Riders will be forced to use 
transit centers -- usually at dismal and desolate places without stores, 
restrooms or other urban amenities. Several lines will run even less 
frequently, so that, except in rush hours, people will still have to wait long 
whiles for buses. All or parts of some major streets will lose bus services 
altogether -- this will be particularly true in low-income and minority areas, 
which have the bulk of the bus-riding public. 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of Warner Center is appreciated, but will it generate the 
amount of bus riders to justify the hub-and-spoke plans for it? How many bus 
lines will feed into the center and at the expense of how many other lines? 
</P>
<P>
 If one is a bus rider , it would be very difficult to support the 
hub-and-spoke concept for the Valley. I see the Valley for what it is and what 
it needs in the way of public transportation for I am an all-purpose user of 
the system. I see the schools, the industrial areas, the parks, the shopping 
centers that are underserved -- or not served at all, such as the equestrian 
center.

IT'S TIME TO OVERHAUL JURY SELECTION PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was recently summoned to appear for jury duty at the Van Nuys Courthouse for 
the first time. In spite of the impact of being away from my office, it was an 
interesting prospect to observe the court system in action and to do my civic 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to my chagrin, I discovered a process so cumbersome, uncaring and 
antiquated it was still in the 19th Century, if that. The jury room was, at any 
given time, filled with 100 to 200 other potential jurors sitting and waiting 
-- reading, watching TV, talking, knitting -- while an occasional panel was 
called and sent out. There seemed to be no consideration given to anything but 
having warm bodies on call when they might be needed, regardless of the 
inconvenience to those "bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 There must be a more efficient way to have jurors available, and the county 
needs to come into the 20th Century and use the tools available in computers to 
determine cases pending, length of potential trials, a match of how long 
potential jurors can serve and so on, and then to institute a call-in system 
that allows jurors to be on call and to reach a recorded message that handles 
multiple calls. This would encourage people to participate in the process, cut 
traffic congestion and save employers and taxpayers money. Private industry 
must find efficient ways to avoid waste, and the court system should have to do 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time we overhaul the jury selection process so that costs can be cut and 
potential jurors will be more willing to perform this vital service.

A SHORTER MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was heartened to hear of Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy's sacrifice to 
ensure that Willie Brown does not get reelected as Speaker of the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than being sworn in as a state senator, he is going to stick around the 
Assembly and forfeit his Senate seat, leaving it vacant once again. This is 
good news for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia), who desperately wants to run for 
higher office, can carpetbag into Diamond Bar rather than carpetbagging to 
Newport Beach. It makes more sense because he'll only have to move five miles 
to run in an empty Senate district as opposed to moving 20 miles into Orange 
County's coastal district.

CADAVER PROSECTION IS ETHICALLY DONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wish to respond to the letter of Allen Porter (Nov. 27), which questioned 
the ethics of the cadaver prosection program at Orange Coast College in 
reference to the "Bodies of Knowledge" article (Nov. 15). 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Porter's letter refers to a five-hour anatomy course as the prerequisite. 
That course is actually a five-unit semester-length course that involves more 
than 50 hours of lecture and 100 hours of laboratory time. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are carefully instructed in the care and handling of human 
remains, and part of that training concerns the significance of donating a body 
to science. The students understand the importance of this decision to 
themselves and the program. 
</P>
<P>
 A significant outcome for the students in these classes is a greater respect 
for life and the human body. Simply because the Times reporter did not choose 
to mention our instruction in medical ethics does not mean that it doesn't 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Porter's statement was not based on any facts reported in the article. 
</P>
<P>
 I also take exception to Mr. Porter's allegation that an open door contributes 
to a "carnival atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Quite contrary to that. I believe that our openness contributes to a college 
atmosphere where education occurs both in and out of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy of leaving the door to the dissection laboratory open at times is a 
carefully considered department decision and not something required for 
ventilation. If a student wants to come in, look closely at a body and ask some 
questions, we hope it is a learning experience that provides a greater 
understanding of their own body and a greater respect for life. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't need publicity to attract students to the biology program at Orange 
Coast College. Our reputation for excellence and quality instruction brings us 
twice the number of students that we can accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I do want people considering donation of their bodies to science to 
know that we understand how great a gift that is. 
</P>
<P>
 We have seen the lives of many students greatly enriched by the educational 
program made possible through those gifts, and we will always insist on 
sensitivity and respect for this aspect of our program.

TEACH AMERICA'S CHRISTIAN TRADITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Washington is recorded to have said to a group of Indian chiefs who 
decided to bring their children to American schools: "You do well to wish to 
learn our arts and our ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus 
Christ . . . " I'll bet that's not taught in any of Orange County's public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County superintendent of schools, John F. Dean, defends the elite 
minority ("Lawmakers Can Better Help Pupils," Dec. 11) against the vast 
majority of Americans who want prayer and the Bible returned to our schools.He 
points to, of all things, the 1962 U.S. Supreme Court decision, and subsequent 
rulings, made by liberal, agnostic and atheist judges as his grounds of 
justification. 
</P>
<P>
 This nation was established as a Christian nation and taught as such in our 
schools and colleges for close to two centuries. Perhaps Mr. Dean and his 
revisionary friends had best step aside so that our rich Christian history and 
spiritual nature can be rediscovered and re-established, whether the Madalyn 
Murray O'Hairs of the world are offended or not.

FUND-RAISER FELLED BY RELIGIOUS APPROACH TO SECULARISM; A SHERMAN OAKS PUBLIC 
SCHOOL'S YULE TREE SALE DIDN'T APPEAR CONTROVERSIAL UNTIL OPPONENTS INVOKED 
DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET BERNSON, Janet Bernson is a free-lance writer who lives in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just this once, I thought, money might grow on trees. It didn't and I'm still 
not sure why. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of our school's bold fund-raising plan may have been related to 
teacher bitterness, or ambient cussedness, or unreasoning sensitivity to 
anything connected with religion, or the dark side of so-called school-based 
management. Those are my choices. To be fair, I suppose, there may have been 
honest disagreement over fundamental principles among people of goodwill. But, 
no, I don't really think so. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever my story means, here it is. 
</P>
<P>
 My son's school, the Millikan Middle School Performing Arts Magnet in Sherman 
Oaks, desperately needs money to transform a shop into a dance studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I am active on the school's fund-raising committee, I was approached in 
the fall by a friend who has a tree farm in Oregon. "I've got an idea for your 
school to make a bundle," he said, and I was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 We parents would invest the cost of cutting and hauling the trees. In turn, we 
would sell them on the school grounds. With luck we could make $15,000 and 
launch our dance-room project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right from the start we were ecumenical beyond ecumenism. Our trees would be 
not only nondenominational but universal. Our trees would symbolize timbers of 
the pre-Christian German woods, not the Nativity. With each tree, we would give 
away literature on Yggdrasil, Ishtar, the Tree of Life and so on, thus 
educating children about mythology and true multiculturalism and avoiding any 
taint of religious isolationism. 
</P>
<P>
 I called everybody on the fund-raising committee, and we enthusiastically 
planned a pre-sale. Buyers would pay in advance so we could order only what we 
needed, avoiding the risk of leftover inventory. Everyone on the committee 
caught the tree bug, and we were raring to go -- until we got entangled in red 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
 I should explain that some decisions at L.A. schools lie in the hands of a 
campus Shared Leadership Council that includes administrators, teachers, 
parents, office staff and students. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal and vice principals of the school all thought the idea was fine. 
Our Parents-Teachers-Students Assn. did too -- it wanted order forms, not 
controversy. The powerful calendar committee of the Shared Leadership Council 
voted for the plan, as did the full council, using its emergency telephone 
procedure (even though, ominously, one teacher pointedly dissented and two 
political fence-sitters, a teacher and an office employee, abstained). 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble came from a handful of teachers who objected on grounds of 
separation of church and state. Insisting that the trees were religious symbols 
for Christmas and therefore would offend Jewish pupils and neighbors, they 
threatened legal action if we followed through on our sale. 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised, since Jewish parents (myself included) were among the most 
supportive of the Yule Tree Sale in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the full Shared Leadership Council held a face-to-face meeting 
four weeks ago, Jewish neighbors had called to complain, a rabbi had written 
denouncing the plan, the faculty had been split down the middle, threats of a 
lawsuit and a wildcat strike had swept through the halls, and it was becoming 
clear that the tree sale was dead. Despite the grass-roots democratic vote, the 
principal announced that the idea was simply too divisive for us to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked one of the opposing teachers how we ought to raise the money, she 
replied, "That's not my job. Perhaps you could sell trees at another time of 
the year." I went home feeling sad and pulled out my books with information on 
mythology and the history of trees.  
</P>
<P>
 Trees represent knowledge. Everybody knows about Eve's apple tree. In the 
Haggada, it's a fig tree. In Rome the fig tree Ruminalis was worshiped as a 
goddess symbol. Pomegranates adorned King Solomon's temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Yule trees were introduced to England by Prince Albert of Germany when he 
married Victoria, thus passing on the pagan (not Judeo-Christian) winter custom 
of tree worship. Am I starting to sound like Joseph Campbell? Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more to the point, the school district's legal counsel had said the 
sale would be legal. Other L.A. public schools have tree sales without 
litigation or fury. Canoga Park High School is selling them -- alive so you can 
keep one permanently -- and bluntly calls them Christmas trees. Students at 
Patrick Henry middle and Chatsworth high schools announced record 
Christmas-tree pre-sales the other day. Some time ago, the Supreme Court of the 
United States, drawing fine lines about what's church and what's not, ruled 
Christmas trees to be among the secular symbols of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was rehashed for two hours at our Shared Leadership Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone proposed that next year we hold a holiday sale of multicultural 
religious items so as to include everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you mean that if we sold trees next year it would be all right?" someone 
asked. The anti-tree faction agreed, "as long as there will be religious 
objects from other cultures." Menorahs and crucifixes for sale -- order now 
from your local school? I'm no lawyer, but I have a suspicion this is not the 
solution to this problem. Fortunately, the school administration, the Shared 
Leadership Council and the PTSA have a year to wrestle with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, if we want to get that dance room for our kids, we'll have to go 
back to selling candy and hope a teacher on a diet doesn't close us down.

Dec. 13) is unwarranted and an attempt to deflect recent criticism of the 
Amigos (de Bolsa Chica). The past efforts of the Amigos are appreciated, but a 
great many of the members do not support the densities proposed. Density is the 
issue, and it will cost the city of Huntington Beach $6 million per year in 
subsidies to pay for spill-over infrastructure improvements and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a more sound economic as well as environmental solution? Yes, it is a 
land transfer. Those of us with the energy to continue to fight this 
ill-conceived project will take up where the Amigos left off in 1989.

 * Peter Green's comments ring hollow, especially since the Sierra Club did not 
endorse him in the last Huntington Beach City Council election. The reason for 
no endorsement? He is on the board of a "wise misuse" group -- Californians for 
Bolsa Chica -- organized, according to the group's chair, by the developer's 
public relations representative. Green was elected anyway, mostly on his prior 
reputation as a protector of Bolsa Chica. However, knowingly or not, he is now 
a pawn of the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups across the nation are being attacked by polluters and 
land speculators, using partial truths and tactics like those employed by Koll 
(Real Estate Group). Koll is a member of the National Wetlands Coalition, 
organized by Washington lobbyists who are working on dismantling the entire 
Clean Water Act, a law that isn't strong enough, as we're losing 800 acres of 
wetlands each day in this country! 
</P>
<P>
 These greed-motivated destroyers of the planet know, by reading opinion polls 
such as the one released this year by The Times, that the majority of citizens 
value environmental protections, even to the point that they favor 
environmental protection over economic development! So they resort to lies and 
false promises in order to be in tune with the populace. 
</P>
<P>
 If we are going to leave a meaningful legacy to future generations, we must 
search for the complete truth. A new Sierra Club book, War Against the Greens, 
explains these "wise use" tactics. It's frightening to see parallels between 
the book's examples and what's happening here in Orange County.

 I find it significant that nowhere in the article ("Foes of Prop. 187 Urge 
Boycott of Nabisco, Disney," Dec. 9) about the plans to boycott Disney (because 
of its support of Gov. Wilson, who supported Proposition 187) do the boycott 
organizers distinguish between legal and illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is directed only at illegal immigration. Legal immigrants 
should not be misled by those who, in supporting illegal immigration, try to 
lump all immigration together. Illegal immigration hurts legal immigrants most 
by taking jobs and services from them.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; THE ARROGANCE EVIDENT IN OUR LIVES 
CRIES FOR SPIRITUAL HOUSECLEANING; AS COUNTY RESIDENTS FIND THEMSELVES FACING 
NEW HARDSHIPS, IT'S TIME TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO EVERY DAY LIVE WITHOUT.

Ha-Ma'alot in Irvine.

<P>
 There is a spiritual dimension to our present economic crisis in Orange 
County. While much is being done and will continue to be done to address the 
fiscal aspect of the crises, we have spiritual work to do as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For as many years as I can recall, there has been a certain hubris operative 
in our county. One might call it the John Wayne syndrome of the individual 
pulling oneself up by his or her own bootstraps while going it alone defending 
God, Country and Motherhood. The only problem with this model is that no one 
goes it alone. Each of us is interdependent with everyone else. And lest we 
forget, beneath the image of John Wayne is nothing more than Tinseltown. For as 
we remind ourselves, there was little more heroic about this fine actor's life 
than retakes of his scenes on the range or on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for our county to deepen its sensitivity to those who fall upon 
hard times, not out of laziness, but due to factors beyond their control -- 
like color of skin, ethnic or religious origin, or someone else speculating 
irresponsibility with a fiduciary responsibility over which they had little or 
no control. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a spiritual principle operative here that goes something like this: 
What we do in our lives down here opens up spiritual energy forces above. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, we need to be careful not to brag or feel superior over our good 
fortune at another's expense. We have all had an experience such as coming home 
from a social event and critiquing another couple. We smugly point out our 
virtues over theirs, how they are constantly bickering while we are so 
sensitive to each other. And sure enough within hours or days we find ourselves 
bricking beyond control. 
</P>
<P>
 We have, as it were, opened ourselves to accusation from above, and we find 
ourselves paying for the arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 For years now we have been, with notable exceptions, less caring then we could 
have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Our charitable contributions have fallen far short of our abilities. Even our 
public pronouncements have seldom created a context of compassion toward those 
less fortunate than ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we as a county are on the verge of experiencing heartbreak, and we fear 
for our own economic future. 
</P>
<P>
 And so I suggest that we have a lot of spiritual work to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from all the practical steps that will be taken by our political 
representatives and fiscal experts, we need to work on ourselves as well. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to allow our broken hearts to become open hearts. It is time to begin 
chiseling away the barnacles of hardness, of arrogance, of superiority feelings 
and open ourselves to compassion and caring. 
</P>
<P>
 For each of our spiritual traditions have been telling us that only by our 
conduct down here on this earthly plane of time and space and monetary funds do 
we affect the eternal dimensions above. By our life down here do we open 
channels of healthy or unhealthy energy flowing from above. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us begin this very season that finds so many living without. As we fear 
for our own fiscal future, let us use our broken hearts so that they open to 
others a bit more compassionately and lovingly. Let us reach out to those who 
have less so that the heavens may open and shower upon us a bit more wisdom to 
resolve our own crisis of pocketbook and soul.

<P>
 I would like to commend the public figure you wrote about (Nov. 19).That 
figure is Santa Ana Mayor Miguel A. Pulido Jr. I do not personally know Pulido, 
but after reading the article featuring him I feel that he is a prime example 
of a success in our world today. Satisfying such a wide spectrum of groups in a 
divided city is a task that needs to be handled carefully, in which he thus far 
has done so well. Hopefully he can turn Santa Ana around for the better.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; EASY MONEY'S JUST A FAIRY TALE -- BUT 
THE SKY REALLY WAS FALLING; IRVINE IS PAYING A HIGH PRICE FOR JUMPING ON THE 
COUNTY INVESTMENT POOL BANDWAGON. VIEW IT AS A CIVICS LESSON FOR ALL OF US. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By STEPHEN C. SMITH, Stephen C. Smith is a public policy consultant. He served 
in Irvine as a budget analyst from 1985 to 1988. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fingers of blame for Orange County's "bondquake" have been duly pointed at 
former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron and the Board of Supervisors. 
In our rush to judgment, however, many other culprits have so far escaped 
public scrutiny. They may go forever unknown because their names never appear 
in headlines or on a ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that their intentions were evil. Far from it. Orange County cities have 
suffered several lean fiscal years. Although the money wasn't there, the 
public's demand for services and infrastructure improvements never wavered. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-intentioned elected officials and public agency executives were forced to 
scramble for new revenues wherever they could find them. If it made a buck and 
kept the public happy, no questions were asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a scenario occurred last July in Irvine. The scheme, all but hidden from 
the taxpayers, may result in the city declaring bankruptcy. The optimistic 
scenario requires Irvine taxpayers to absorb a major fiscal loss of $20 million 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, a more prudent Irvine City Council created an Economic 
Uncertainties Reserve. This policy required the city to set aside 5% of its 
operating budget for protection against extreme financial hardship or disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 When the recession began, Irvine suffered a drastic loss in revenues. 
Subsequent City Councils dipped into the reserve but eventually had to lay off 
20% of the staff and cut services. Still the city bled red ink. In May, 1993, 
with no end to the recession in sight, city officials made a deal with the 
devil. 
</P>
<P>
 Disregarding prudent policies, Irvine created a Revenue Enhancement Fund. This 
obscure account was opened not to pay for street improvements or a new park or 
even sewer lines. It was created to bankroll a swim in the county's investment 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine issued $60 million of general obligation taxable notes, due and payable 
in one year. Irvine invested it in the Orange County Investment Pool (OCIP), 
which yielded a higher interest rate than the rate on the notes. The objective 
was to make a profit off the difference and transfer it to the depleted general 
fund, the city's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked -- the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine made $2 million off the scheme, and most of it was transferred into the 
general fund, satisfying city policy to maintain a 5% reserve. It worked so 
well that in July, they did it again, dropping another $62 million into OCIP. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time it won't work. 
</P>
<P>
 When OCIP was declared bankrupt, its assets were frozen. If Irvine can't get 
all of its money back by next July, it will have to repay $62 million plus 
interest to the note holders. Irvine taxpayers will have to pick up the tab for 
the $3-million interest plus whatever the city can't recover from the OCIP's 
liquidation -- which according to recent media reports may be $17 million or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. and Finance Director Jeff Niven proposed the 
issuance of the general obligation notes. They were supported by Rauscher 
Pierce Refsnes Inc., the note underwriter. Mayor Michael Ward and council 
members Barry J. Hammond and Paula Werner voted to approve it. Members 
Christina L. Shea and Greg Smith had the foresight to oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution adopted by the majority of the Irvine City Council clearly 
states the consequences of a general obligation note. If the principal isn't 
available to repay the debt, the note holders are repaid from the general fund 
-- the fund that pays for virtually every daily service provided by the city. 
But the $62 million is more than the entire projected general fund revenues for 
the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, general obligation bonds require a two-thirds voter approval. 
General obligation notes , however, require no voter approval. City officials 
used this loophole to issue a $62-million debt without any review by the 
voters. The consequence is that Irvine's operating budget is in danger of 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal legislators are already scrambling to plug loopholes such as 
these. Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) has introduced AB 47, which 
intends to close many of these loopholes. The bill must include a provision to 
prohibit a city from issuing general obligation taxable notes, which place its 
operating budget at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters must take responsibility as well. When was the last time you read 
your city's budget? When was the last time you attended a city council meeting? 
Schemes like the Irvine note program happen because no members of the public 
ask hard questions. Local government is perhaps the last place where citizens 
can still make a difference. When we don't get involved, disasters such as this 
bondquake are inevitable.

DEMOCRACY 101: OBEY VOTERS ON 187; THE SCHOOL BOARD AND THE CITY COUNCIL ARE 
SPENDING TAXPAYER FUNDS TO CHALLENGE THE ELECTION'S MANDATE. BIZARRE 
DISTRICTING HELPS THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCOTT, Bob Scott is an attorney in Sherman Oaks, immediate past 
president of the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley and 
spokesman for the organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In case you thought you missed something, the voters actually did pass 
Proposition 187 on Nov. 8! You'd never guess it though, watching the Los 
Angeles City Council and Los Angeles Unified School District squandering our 
tax dollars to challenge the overwhelming mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the seven members of the school board have arrogantly chosen to mount 
an attack against the voters. Four of these members, Mark Slavkin, Jeff Horton, 
Julie Korenstein and Leticia Quezada, supposedly represent parts of the San 
Fernando Valley. These political dictators must have been playing hooky during 
Democracy 101. Perhaps last week's suit against the board by Glenn Spencer, 
president of the Sherman Oaks-based Voice of Citizens Together, will force them 
to face the reality that the people have enacted a new state law -- and they, 
as creatures of a state charter, are subject to that law. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps part of the problem is a lack of accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 the City Council seriously gerrymandered itself and the school 
district. It ignored the suggestions of Valley leaders for compact and 
contiguous districts, creating instead bizarre new LAUSD districts that diluted 
the power of West Valley voters with a West Los Angeles majority, and subjected 
East Valley voters to domination by a majority bloc in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, in the council, lines were drawn that minimized the number of 
Valley-majority districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus it is no surprise that neither the school board nor the City Council 
think it has to answer to Valley voters, who were behind Proposition 187 by an 
even greater percentage majority than the statewide electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, the City Council couldn't wait to join the American Civil 
Liberties Union in a private plaintiff suit against the people of the state of 
California. In response to voter outrage, it wisely modified its position, 
ordering "that the City Attorney be authorized to take only the actions 
necessary to clarify the legal issues concerning those aspects of Proposition 
187 that impact the City's operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the significance of the motion was lost on City Atty. James 
Hahn. He has refused to abandon his crusade against this measure and last week 
was allowed by the court to join the case. In spite of his misguided arguments, 
it simply isn't necessary to manufacture adversity to interpret a statute. An 
opinion of the attorney general should be sufficient -- and a lot less 
expensive. Clearly, what singles out this statute for special attention is the 
not-so-secret agenda of a few of our Downtown politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 An initiative is supposed to be a way for the voters to work around 
unresponsive legislative bodies, like the council and the LAUSD. Since 1911 the 
initiative process has provided the people of this state with an essential 
democratic tool. Even the normally stoic California Supreme Court has heaped 
flowery praise on the initiative process, proclaiming that there is hardly 
anything more fundamental and respected than the "precious right" of the 
initiative. It should be "jealously guarded" as this is not a "right granted to 
the people, but a power reserved by them" as "one of the most precious rights 
of our democratic process," the court has said. 
</P>
<P>
 By filing suit our local agencies are doing precisely what the initiative 
seeks to stop -- spending scarce taxpayer dollars for the benefit of illegal 
foreign nationals. They are actively meddling in issues that are beyond the 
scope of their charters and are in violation of the voters' undeniable mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to analyze what drives these distorted agendas. Many who feed 
at the government trough decry private -sector special interests but feel quite 
at home with public -sector special interests. They gain political strength by 
increasing government dependency among the population. Prior to Nov. 8, 
5,470,000,000 people in the world were eligible to come to California for free, 
taxpayer-supported services. This provided an unlimited supply of potential 
dependents. Proposition 187 has now reduced that eligible number by more than 5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Tragically, the city is adopting ACLU positions and making arguments against 
our own interests. In sworn declarations filed with the court, Hahn and Police 
Chief Willie L. Williams provided unfounded opinions of the possible negative 
outcomes of enforcement of the measure. Our attorneys are going to look pretty 
foolish when they end up having to enforce the statute. If anything, they 
should be working with the attorney general as advocates for the will of the 
people, not opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
 With council and school board elections coming up in April, it appears that 
Valley voters will have to finish the job they started on Nov. 8.

TITANS DEAL GRGURICH AN UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was supposed to be a big homecoming celebration for Nevada Las Vegas Coach 
Tim Grgurich, but it turned out to be a night for Cal State Fullerton and Chris 
St. Clair. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Clair hit a three-point jump shot from the side with eight seconds left to 
lift the Titans to an 82-80, come-from-behind victory over the Rebels on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, picked to finish last in the Big West Conference, spoiled the home 
debut of Grgurich by turning in a gutsy performance under pressure late in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (2-3) has won three of the last four games against UNLV (0-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton surprised UNLV, 84-75, at the Thomas & Mack Center last season for 
one of its eight regular-season victories. It was one of five defeats the 
Rebels suffered at home in a 15-13 season under Rollie Massimino, who was 
forced to take a $1.8-million buyout in October after a secret supplemental 
contract came to light. That brought Grgurich back to the school where he 
served for 12 years as an assistant to Jerry Tarkanian, who was courtside for 
the first time since his firing. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Titan Coach Bob Hawking who was able to do the celebrating this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans were down by 11 points with less than 12 minutes remaining and they 
still looked as if they were in trouble, trailing, 80-77, with 1:31 left after 
David Frigout missed two free throws. UNLV gained control, but Reggie Manuel 
missed and the Titans closed the gap to 80-79 on center Winston Peterson's 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans got another break when Manuel was called for traveling in a 
scramble for a loose ball. That set the stage for St. Clair's winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids really played hard and this was a big win for our program," Hawking 
said. "They were really focused on what we were trying to do. Last week week we 
wilted under UCLA's pressure in the second half, but we kept telling our kids 
to hang in there and they were able to deal with UNLV's run this time and stay 
close. If you hang in there until the end, anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said St. Clair's shot was one the Titans were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris is our money player in terms of being our perimeter shooter," Hawking 
said. " We were working to get that kind of shot at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Clair wasn't surprised the ball came to him on a pass from guard James 
French. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw James penetrate and when I saw him leave his feet, I realized that he 
would pass the ball to me. I just spotted up and felt confident. It was about 
like everything was in slow motion." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson also had another big night, scoring 25 points to lead the Titans. 
Peterson connected on 10 of 14 shots from the field and had seven rebounds. St. 
Clair had 17 points and was five for nine from the field. Chris Dade also had 
16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel's 26 points were high for the Rebels, who shot 38.1% from the field in 
the first half. The Rebels wound up hitting 53.3% for the game; the Titans shot 
47.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans got off to a good start and led through most of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 A string of 11 consecutive points put Fullerton ahead, 19-9, but the Rebels 
trimmed the deficit to 22-21. Fullerton managed to turn back that rush to hold 
on for a 39-36 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans were six points ahead with just a few seconds remaining in the 
first half, but reserve John Williams fouled Clayton Johnson on a long-range 
three-point attempt and Johnson made all three free throws with no time left on 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV came out strong at the start of the second half. The Rebels outscored the 
Titans, 16-8, and Manuel's three-point jump shot from the corner gave UNLV a 
52-47 lead. Another Manuel three-pointer made it 63-51 and the Rebels held a 
67-57 command with just more than 10 minutes left.

UC IRVINE LETS ARIZONA STATE OFF THE HOOK IN SECOND HALF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Rod Baker ran his finger down UC Irvine's nonconference schedule before 
the season began and pointed to games against Ohio and Arizona State. "I think 
we're good enough to play with all of these teams but maybe these two," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters proved him wrong during an overtime loss to the 14th-ranked 
Bobcats on Dec. 2. And they almost proved him wrong again against the Sun 
Devils on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine led 13th-ranked Arizona State, 47-42, with 13:43 left to play, but then 
the Sun Devils discovered a new gear and ran away with an 87-58 victory in 
front of 6,249 at the University Activities Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Arizona State four minutes to turn that five-point deficit into a 
10-point lead with a 15-0 run. And the Sun Devils (5-1) were on cruise control 
only three minutes after that, holding a 69-51 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought walking into the building tonight that we could play with these 
guys, but I guess we're only good enough to play with them for 30 minutes," 
Baker said. "The fact that we didn't rebound in the second half is what killed 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "But don't get me wrong. They are a very, very good team. They are definitely 
going to hurt some people's feelings in the Pac-10 this season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils' full-court press caused 13 second-half turnovers. And their 
mastery of the boards after halftime -- they outrebounded Irvine by 16 after 
both teams had 21 in the first half -- turned the contest from an 
upset-in-the-making into a laugher and dropped the Anteaters to 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so bad in the first half," Arizona State Coach Bill Frieder said. "We 
hadn't played in two weeks and when you don't shoot well, you don't play well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils, who came into the game with the second-best field-goal 
shooting percentage (.567) in the country, made only 34% of their first-half 
shots from the floor. With the Anteaters double-teaming 6-foot-9 forward Mario 
Bennett underneath, Arizona State struggled to score from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Isaac Burton, who finished with 18 points, began to find the range 
outside, it opened things up for Bennett, who scored 10 points in the second 
half and ended up with 14 points and 11 rebounds. The Sun Devils shot 40% for 
the game, the first time this season they have shot less than 52% from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, which had used a balanced attack to beat its last two opponents, got 
an inspired offensive effort from forward transfer Michael Tate, who scored six 
points as Irvine jumped to a 15-7 lead and finished with 10 points and 11 
rebounds. And forwards Mark Odsather and Khalid Channell combined to score 23. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Anteaters did not get a point from their leading scorer, point guard 
Raimonds Miglinieks, or their top-scoring inside threat, freshman forward Kevin 
Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 "When your starting point guard and a starting forward don't score a point, I 
don't care who you are, you're going to have trouble winning," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks, who always looks to pass before shooting, had six assists but did 
not attempt a field goal before fouling out with 3:25 remaining. And with 
Miglinieks on the bench, Arizona State's press became an even more effective 
tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't have a good shot, I'm not going to shoot," said Miglinieks, who 
had 828 assists in two years at Riverside City College. "We were taking our 
shots too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played good for a while, but you have to play all 40 minutes. If you can't 
play for 40 minutes, then just go off the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Chris Brown, who was the most prolific three-point shooter in the 
country last season, continues to struggle. He made only three of 13 
three-point attempts, but still led the Anteaters in scoring with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was exactly like the overtime against Ohio U.," he said. "We start to 
get satisfied with what we have and we relax a little bit. They were more 
aggressive and got a couple of steals out of their press and then that made 
them more intense and our heads went down."

BOYS' BASKETBALL / IRVINE WORLD NEWS TOURNAMENT; SANTA ANA VALLEY DEFENDS ITS 
TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine World News tournament had never had a repeat champion. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley pulled off the feat Saturday, beating back stubborn Estancia, 
62-58, at Concordia for its second consecutive title. Last year, the Falcons 
defeated Trabuco Hills in the championship game. It was the first time in 13 
years of the boys' basketball tournament there was a repeat champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Falcon forward Ike Harmon led all scorers with 23 points and was named 
tournament MVP. Not that it was easy; Harmon, who is bothered by a sore lower 
back, took a bad spill in the third quarter. Although he finished the game, he 
will be examined before the Falcons travel to Raleigh, N.C., for a holiday 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts," Harmon said, "but there's no way I'm going to miss that trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Olujimi Mann added 16 points for the Falcons. Kevin Byrne had 19 for Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
 A 13-0 run by Santa Ana Valley (7-4) in the third quarter, prompted partly by 
a shift in strategy, reversed a 37-30 Eagles lead for good. It was up to the 
Falcons to withstand a couple of final rushes by Estancia (9-2) to claim 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "That run was the difference," said Eagle Coach Tim Parsel, who had primed his 
team for a potential meeting with Santa Ana Valley in the summer. "They have 
some very talented players, especially Mann and Harmon, and when you get easy 
shots against them you have to hit them." 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia did that and more in the first half. By alternating its man-to-man 
and zone matchup defenses, it forced Santa Ana Valley into a medium tempo, did 
not sustain a rash of turnovers (13 for the game) and often held the Falcons to 
one shot. The Eagles, in particular Byrne and Chris Candlish (who had 11 points 
before fouling out), threw in liberal doses of body checks and forearms as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played us very physical -- which is the way I would play us," Falcon 
Coach Rich Prospero said. "They also played smart. I have a lot of respect for 
them; they are good." 
</P>
<P>
 To negate Estancia's power, Prospero made two key adjustments. Instead of 
having Harmon float along the wings and baselines, he had the 6-foot-7 junior 
stay near the basket. That forced Byrne and Candlish to play more defense. And 
Prospero had his guards go one-on-one to break down the Eagles' outer defense 
and drive toward the basket. Mann more than once exploited the Estancia 
defenders for easy layups. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got good quickness and were able to penetrate in the second half," 
Parsel said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Jordan 76, Trabuco Hills 60 -- Ortege Jenkins had 21 points and 
George North had 16 points for Long Beach Jordan (5-4) in the third-place game. 
Rob Warnick for Trabuco Hills (6-3) led all scorers with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge 61, Irvine 51 -- Eric Ripley had 22 points and sophomore Chris 
Burgess had 20 for Woodbridge (7-2). Darrell Parker had 16 points to lead 
Irvine (3-7). 
</P>
<P>
 In the consolation championship: 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley 63, Kennedy 47 -- Brad Thornton had 21 points and Todd 
Hector had 11 points to lead Capistrano Valley (7-4). Justin Zuschlag had 18 
points, including four three-pointers, for Kennedy (4-5). 
</P>
<P>
 "They played us very physical -- which is the way I would play us," Falcon 
Coach Rich Prospero said. "They also played smart. I have a lot of respect for 
them; they are good." 
</P>
<P>
 To negate Estancia's power, Prospero made two key adjustments. Instead of 
having Harmon float along the wings and baselines, he had the 6-foot-7 junior 
stay near the basket. That forced Byrne and Candlish to play more defense. And 
Prospero had his guards go one-on-one to break down the Eagles' outer defense 
and drive toward the basket. Mann more than once exploited the Estancia 
defenders for easy layups. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got good quickness and were able to penetrate in the second half," 
Parsel said.

BOYS' BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS; MATER DEI PROVES TO TUSTIN IT CAN WIN 
WITHOUT COTTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei seemed ripe for picking. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since 1988, another Orange County team seemed ready to be 
of the hill. Tustin had those aspirations. By the end of Saturday night's game, 
they looked more like pipe dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei came up with its best game without its best player, grinding out a 
55-46 victory over the Tillers to win their fourth consecutive Tournament of 
Champions title at Ocean View High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (6-0) did so without sophomore Schea Cotton, who drew a one-game 
suspension after being ejected in Friday's semifinal. The Monarchs did so 
despite facing Tustin, a talented team that was focused on getting Orange 
County's top ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew as a team, we had to come up big," center Shaun Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs did, but it was Jackson, a 6-foot-7 senior, who stood tallest. He 
scored nine of his 27 points in the fourth quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Raffi Lalazarian's three-pointer cut the Mater Dei lead to 43-41 with 6 
minutes 26 seconds left. Jackson answered with a driving layup that drew a 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time down, Jackson went down the baseline, spun and hit a short bank 
shot. He then raced back up court, arms raised. Tustin didn't challenge again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came down to us not be able to stop Shaun," said Tustin point guard Doug 
Gottlieb, who finished with 14 points and nine assists. "Every time we made a 
run, he made a shot. Every time we needed the ball, he got the rebound. He 
killed us." 
</P>
<P>
 From Tustin's standpoint, the game did not follow the script. The Tillers were 
looking to join an exclusive club. Only five county high schools have beaten 
Mater Dei since Gary McKnight became the Monarchs' coach in 1982. In that time, 
only Saddleback has finished No. 1 (1988) in the county poll. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Tillers' chances looked good. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, one of the top players in Southern California, was suspended after an 
altercation with an official in the game against Ocean View. Cotton verbally 
abused and then bumped the referee and was ejected. Under Southern Section 
rules, a player must sit out the game after an ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Things seemed to follow Tustin's script in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei led by as many as 11 points in the first half, but couldn't rattle 
the Tillers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay McKnight sank a three-pointer to give the Monarchs a 26-15 lead with 3:44 
left in the second quarter. Then Gottlieb went to work, demonstrating his vast 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a jumper, then fed Matt Kraus for a layup. Next, Gottlieb drove for a 
layup and was fouled. He followed that with consecutive assists that left the 
Monarchs flat-footed. 
</P>
<P>
 In two minutes, Gottlieb had pulled the Tillers even, 26-26. He had eight 
points and seven assists in the half, accounting for 22 of Tustin's 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson seemed to shoulder the burden created by Cotton's absence. He scored 
13 points and had nine rebounds in the first half. Jackson hit a five-footer 
with four seconds left to give Mater Dei a 30-28 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs had their best defensive performance of the season. They limited 
Tustin guard Robert Griffin, averaging 12 points, to three points. They kept 
David Lalazarian, Tustin's 6-7 center, from becoming a factor, holding him to 
eight points. The Monarchs also were able to slow Gottlieb in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei then smothered the Tillers in the fourth quarter. After Raffi 
Lalazarian's three-pointer, Tustin went scoreless for for nearly four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the Monarchs, and Jackson, had things well in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester 77, Ocean View 60 -- Danny Walker and Ben Sanders each had 20 
points for Westchester (5-1), who outscored Ocean View, 25-10, after the first 
quarter. Sanders was 10 of 19 from the field and Walker was 8 of 13 with four 
three-pointers. Dan McDonald had 29 points and 10 rebounds for Ocean View 
(6-5), which outscored Westchester, 27-8, from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos 58, Los Angeles Fairfax 54 -- Ali Ton had 17 points and Cory 
Johnson and Jarem Vandervoet each had 14 points for Los Alamitos (7-2). Jair 
Fray had 15 points for Fairfax (4-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In the consolation championship game: 
</P>
<P>
 La Puente Nogales 63, Servite 55 -- Shonario Richard scored 18 points to lead 
Nogales (9-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Seaton, Servite's 6-9 center who has signed to play for Stanford, broke 
his foot during the game and will be out for 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a consolation game: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Manual Arts 57, Newport Harbor 38 -- Travis Reed had 21 points and 
seven rebounds to lead Manual Arts (3-6), which outscored Newport Harbor, 
33-13, in the second half of their consolation game. Mark Hornung had 13 points 
for Newport Harbor (4-6).

 Sarah Warnick broke a 59-59 tie with two free throws in the late going to help 
lead Trabuco Hills to a 67-64 victory over Montebello Cantwell Sacred Heart on 
Saturday night in the championship game of the Bolsa Grande Christmas Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Warnick followed with two more free throws and a field goal before fouling out 
with 1 minute 12 seconds left, when the Mustangs had a three-point edge.It was 
Trabuco Hills' first girls' basketball tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
 LaShieka Henderson, tournament most valuable player, had 22 points and 13 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (8-2) overcame a 16-9 first-quarter deficit to take a 33-26 lead 
at halftime. Leading the way was Henderson, who scored 13 points in the second 
quarter.

<P>
 A week after blowing a halftime lead and losing to Redlands, Chapman put away 
the Bulldogs in the second half, and won, 77-57, in a nonconference men's 
basketball game Saturday at Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (5-3) led by six at the break, but outscored Redlands, 30-21, in 
the first 12 minutes of the second half to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game at Redlands on Dec. 10, Chapman had a five-point halftime lead but 
was outscored, 34-7, in the first 10 minutes of the second half and lost, 
87-80. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind Stefan Mumaw, the Panthers were able to turn things around, as the 
6-foot-8 center had 20 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumaw had 15 of his points in the first half as Chapman led by as many as 11 
before Redlands' Steve Reed hit a three-pointer at the buzzer to make it 37-31. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs cut Chapman's lead to 39-37 four minutes into the second half, 
but three-pointers from Anthony Gonzales and Jeff Reeves put the Panthers ahead 
by seven with 12:20 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands never got closer than six the rest of the way and Chapman built a 
65-50 lead on consecutive baskets from Corey Klinke, who finished with 11 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Dzierzynski, who scored 31 against Redlands last week, was held to eight 
points but he had 12 assists. DAN ARRITT

PROTESTS STALL PROJECT PLANS FOR ST. MARY'S; EDUCATION: IT'S OPPOSED BY 
PRESERVATION GROUPS THAT SAY THE AREA'S HISTORIC AMBIENCE WOULD BE RUINED BY 
EXPANSION OF THE WOMEN'S COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER Y. HONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A library and classroom building for a Catholic women's college would be a 
welcome addition to many neighborhoods, but protests from local 
preservationists have stalled such a project at the Mt. St. Mary's College 
campus in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials say the two-story building is needed to ease crowding at the 
school, which has about 900 students, 300 more than it did five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But those opposed to the project say it would ruin the historic setting of the 
college by removing trees and eliminating open space on Chester Place, an 
enclave of turn-of-the-century houses that was once the estate of oil baron 
Edward L. Doheny. First laid out in 1895, Chester Place runs between 23rd 
Street and West Adams Boulevard, west of South Figueroa Street. 
</P>
<P>
 James R. Childs, a member of the North University Park Community Assn., a 
neighborhood group that opposes the plan, said the proposed 59,000-square-foot 
complex would scar the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chester Place is the sum of its whole environment, not just its buildings. If 
you took part of Central Park and put high-rises on it, you'd have a different 
Central Park. Overdeveloping Chester Place would cause the same problem," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although no buildings would be demolished under the plan, the college would 
have to move a building to another part of the campus to make way for the new 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs' organization, along with two other preservation groups, the West Adams 
Heritage Assn. and the Los Angeles Conservancy, have asked the city Planning 
Department to further review the environmental and historical impact of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays have frustrated college officials, who had hoped to start building 
by now, and who insist that its impact on the neighborhood's character will be 
minimal because the building will be entirely within the gated 15-acre campus 
and no buildings will be razed to make way for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Kathleen Kelly, the college's vice president in charge of the Doheny 
campus, said the college has designed the complex to be consistent with the 
campus' existing architecture, and emphasized that the new building will serve 
the neighborhood because most of the college's students come from neighborhood 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're committed to offering the best education to neighborhood students. Mrs. 
Doheny never intended this to be a park," Kelly said, referring to Carrie 
Estelle Doheny, who bequeathed Chester Place to the college in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 The college had hoped to break ground for the project in August, but 
objections from the groups led the Planning Department to delay hearings for 
the use and zoning permits needed by the college until Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 If allowed to proceed, the $5-million project is expected to take 18 months to 
complete, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its cloistered appearance, Mt. St. Mary's is committed to its 
inner-city community, Kelly said. More than 90% of students at the Doheny 
campus, which offers two-year associate's and master's degrees, receive 
financial aid to offset the $11,340 annual tuition. Sixty-six percent of 
students in the two-year associate's program are Latina, 10% are African 
American, 10% are white and 9% are Asian American. 
</P>
<P>
 The Doheny House, built between 1898 and 1900, is a California historic 
monument, and the state Office of Historic Preservation determined in 1986 that 
the Chester Place district is eligible for listing in the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic status of the area doesn't preclude development, and city 
officials have contended that the Mt. St. Mary's proposal needs no further 
environmental review. A July Planning Department report said that more review 
is not needed, because the only historic monument on the site, the Doheny 
House, will not be touched, and the building that will be moved will not be 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs, however, contends that "the Doheny Mansion is affected when its 
context and setting is changed," and has proposed that the college look at 
other sites near Chester Place, which Kelly said the college is not 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
 If either the college or one of the preservationist groups appeals the outcome 
of Monday's hearing by the Planning and Zoning departments, which both sides 
say is likely, the City Council and Board of Zoning Appeals will have to 
consider the proposal, delaying the project several more months.

THE TRADITIONS VARY, BUT STILL IT'S CHRISTMAS; HOLIDAY CELEBRATIONS HAVE A 
DECIDEDLY ETHNIC SPIN WITHIN L.A.'S NEIGHBORHOOD ENCLAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In Huntington Park, a bustling carniceria stocks up on cornmeal masa for 
Mexican and Central American tamales, and on lechon , succulent pork that local 
Cuban and Puerto Rican families will roast, smothered in tangy garlic mojo 
sauce, come Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away in South-Central, an African American mother simultaneously 
shops for Christmas presents and for the rich fabrics she and her daughters 
will use to make traditional costumes for Kwanzaa, the African harvest festival 
beginning Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Filipino Catholics in the Rampart area count down the days with an early 
morning Mass, followed by a breakfast of steamed puto bungbong rice cakes, 
while a little to the south, Koreans get ready for an American-style Christmas 
celebration -- with Korean food substituting for turkey, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 In central Los Angeles, decking the halls can take on as many different 
interpretations as there are ethnic groups. And to each group, individual 
traditions are every bit as typical of Christmas as candy canes and carols, a 
link with family and fond memories of holidays past. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the Latino patrons of the R&G Meat Market in Huntington Park, it simply 
isn't Christmas without tamales, or lechon , or any one of the ethnic holiday 
treats the store begins stocking in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of customers we see only on the holidays," said Jorge Cruz Jr., 
who runs the store his Cuban immigrant parents established in 1969. "Even if 
they've become somewhat Americanized, this is what they know as Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past month, the little market's narrow aisles have been crowded with 
stacks of thick green banana leaves used by Central Americans as tamale 
wrappers, piles of naranjas agrias , the sour oranges Cubans and Puerto Ricans 
mix with mashed garlic and spices to baste their lechon , and cases of 
sparkling Spanish sidra wine, stacked almost to the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 In and around the meat counter, whole pigs -- lechones -- and plump pork legs 
compete for space with heavy plastic bags of white, homemade masa . Each 
Christmas, the store goes through approximately 1,000 pounds of masa , 400 pork 
legs and 60 whole pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm second-generation, and my wife is Anglo, a gringa ," Cruz said, smiling. 
"But on Christmas, we go to my parents' house. I've got to have a pork leg, and 
yuca (cassava), and black beans and rice. It's just not right without it." 
</P>
<P>
 For Francisca Montenegro of El Sereno, Christmas is just not right without a 
huge Mexican feast of tamales, all 20 to 30 pounds of them lovingly prepared by 
her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of eight rises early the morning of Christmas Eve -- Noche Buena , 
the "good night," to Latinos -- and begins cooking the meat and grinding  
</P>
<P>
 the spices she will eventually mix into the masa and boil wrapped in corn 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 5 p.m., her three married sons bring their wives and children over to 
join in a night of feasting, exchanging gifts and enjoying one another's 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get tired because you work hard, but you feel satisfied that your 
children are all there, and that we're all at home together," Montenegro said 
warmly. "You want to see them full and happy." 
</P>
<P>
 In her South-Central apartment, Melva Parhams is busy preparing for two 
holiday family gatherings -- one on Christmas Day and another on New Year's 
Eve, the second-to-last and most important day of Kwanzaa, which was introduced 
to the United States in 1966 and is celebrated worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fuzzy red stockings, gold tinsel and a handmade "Happy Birthday Jesus" sign 
share Parhams' living room with a fruit basket representing the first fruits of 
the African harvest and a kinara , which holds seven mshumma saba candles 
representing the seven principles of Kwanzaa: unity, self-determination, 
collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, 
and faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Swaths of velvet and gold lame lying on the sofa will soon be stitched into 
African robes, which she and her two daughters will wear for holiday 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't like to mix the two holidays, but we celebrate both," she 
said. "Kwanzaa gives African Americans something of their own to celebrate, but 
it doesn't stop Christmas. You can incorporate both holidays, back to back." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa tradition also involves gift-giving, as two separate piles of gifts on 
Parhams' floor attest. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Christmas, I have to tell the kids, 'No, no, you can't open those presents 
over there yet,' " she said, motioning to a little pile of wrapped boxes tucked 
away in a corner. "Those are for Kwanzaa." 
</P>
<P>
 For Joel Rambo of Baldwin Hills, Kwanzaa preparations have been going on since 
August, when orders for his red, black and green flags representing Pan-African 
unity started pouring in. Rambo began sewing the flags -- which were adopted 
for Kwanzaa in the late 1960s -- when he was unable to find one for himself 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A full-time video recording engineer, Rambo now finds his part-time 
flag-making business booming during the latter part of the year, with as many 
as 500 flag orders, some of which he now has to farm out to local tailors, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Rampart district, St. Columban Church -- the only Filipino Catholic 
church in the city -- draws local Filipino Americans in before dawn to simban 
gabi , a daily Christmas Mass held at 4 a.m. between Dec. 16 and Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the service, we eat breakfast in the churchyard," said Gabriel 
Espiritu, who attends the services regularly. "We have puto bungbong , and 
salabat , which is a drink made of ginger. Then we all go home and go to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Colonized for centuries by the Spanish and largely Catholic as a result, 
Filipinos are the only Asian American ethnic group for whom Christmas is not an 
adopted holiday. But many of the Asians who have embraced it -- including 
Korean Americans -- participate wholeheartedly in American-style Christmas 
traditions, whether they are Christian or not. 
</P>
<P>
 In Korea, although only about a third of the population is Christian, 
Christmas has been a national holiday for several years, said Chandler Im of 
the Korean Youth and Cultural Center. Even Buddhists go Christmas shopping, and 
the holiday is seen as a fun occasion on which to see family and friends and 
exchange gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a break in the middle of a shopping trip to Koreatown Plaza, Pillhe Oh 
and Geun Soon Lim were engaged in an all-American shopping mall scene. The two 
women sat watching their small children under a two-story Christmas tree, 
occasionally chasing after them as the youngsters scampered off to get a closer 
look at the giant gift boxes and candy canes nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Christmas, the whole family will be together," said Oh, holding her 
daughter, Carol, who turns 1 year old on Christmas Day and will probably get 
new clothes as a gift from mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll stay at home and have Christmas dinner together," Oh said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we'll eat Korean food."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; 1ST LATINA ASTRONAUT VISITS HIGH 
SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ellen Ochoa was a teen-ager, she had no plans to fly in space. Now, as 
NASA's first Latina astronaut, she has done it twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There weren't any women astronauts around when I was in high school," said 
Ochoa, 36. "I just didn't know it was a possibility for me. All I knew then was 
that I liked math and science." 
</P>
<P>
 During a visit to Bell Gardens High School last week, Ochoa's message to 
aspiring engineers, scientists and astronauts was short and simple: Take heavy, 
continual doses of math and science. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you're firmly grounded in the language of math -- which is the language 
scientists use to communicate -- there's no stopping you," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 She should know. A generous helping of calculus in high school led to a 
passion for physics in college. It was at that time that Ochoa first thought of 
becoming an astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept on taking more math and science classes and became more and more 
excited about what to do with them," said the La Mesa, Calif., native, who was 
the valedictorian at San Diego State in 1980. She went on to receive an 
engineering fellowship from Stanford, where she earned her doctorate in 
electrical engineering in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Her work at Stanford, which involved filtering images into holographs, 
resulted in her first patent. Ochoa went on to earn two additional patents in 
the area of optics before joining NASA as part of a research team investigating 
space automation. 
</P>
<P>
 After becoming chief of NASA's Intelligent Systems Branch, Ochoa was selected 
by the space agency to become an astronaut in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so competitive that I was ecstatic to be selected," Ochoa told a group 
of Young Scientists gathered at the high school library. Since then, she has 
participated in space shuttle missions in 1993 and last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so exciting to see a smart woman doing this," said student Jessica 
Gachupin, 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in her blue astronaut's jumpsuit, Ochoa toured the high school, 
including stops at two sophomore-level science classes, one conducted in 
English, the other in the students' primary language, Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my dreams is to learn more about space," said Elizabeth Monreal, 15, 
who greeted the astronaut in Spanish. She arrived five months ago from the 
Mexican state of Durango, and her classmates come from Mexico, Peru, Nicaragua, 
Costa Rica and El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I want to be an astronaut," Monreal said. "Right now I'm 
concentrating on chemistry and biochemistry. I'll see how that goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Monreal went on to show Ochoa how her class was studying space through the use 
of a computer simulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer program is really easy once you get the hang of it, except for a 
few of the words that are in English," Monreal said. SIMON ROMERO

 Two men suspected of fatally shooting a pair of street vendors in Walnut Park 
on Sunday remained at large as investigators gathered information for composite 
sketches, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects are believed to be 18 to 20 years old, said Sgt. Noel Lanier, a 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed they walked up to the vendors, who were selling food from 
pushcarts near Firestone Boulevard and Hooper Avenue, and demanded cash. The 
vendors may have responded slowly, leading one suspect to fire his handgun at 
both of them, Lanier said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unknown whether the suspects escaped with any money. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified one vendor as Sylvester Placencia, 55, of Los Angeles. 
The second vendor, a man believed to be about 50, was not identified pending 
notification of relatives. EFRAIN HERNANDEZ JR.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: COMMERCE; EX-SOUTH EL MONTE OFFICIAL GETS TOP POST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raul Romero has been named city administrator, becoming the second Latino to 
serve in the city's top non-elected position. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, South El Monte city manager since 1984, will begin the job Jan. 3, 
replacing Louis Shepard, who is retiring Tuesday after seven years with the 
city. Romero was selected by the City Council over 33 other candidates during a 
four-month search. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Romero) has the right experience and background for the job, and we expect 
him to fit right in and do a great job for the city," Mayor Ruben Batres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's salary will be about $105,000, compared to his $82,500 annual salary 
in South El Monte. Shepard earned $131,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city administrator takes care of the day-to-day responsibilities for the 
city, which has undergone profound economic, demographic and political changes 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as I've done in my previous jobs, I'd like to make economic development 
one of Commerce's highest goals," said Romero, 48. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his job with South El Monte, Romero served as city manager of 
Coachella, assistant city administrator for Hawaiian Gardens, administrative 
analyst for the cities of Glendale and Long Beach and community relations 
coordinator for Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero grew up in East Los Angeles. He attended East Los Angeles College and 
Cal State L.A., where he received a bachelor's degree in Spanish. He earned a 
master's degree in public administration at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 His experience in South El Monte includes establishment of the South El Monte 
Economic Development Committee, made up of business, education, utility, 
resident and government representatives. Romero also helped form the Rosemead 
Business Improvement District. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Commerce residential and business communities are similar to those in 
South El Monte," Romero said. "I have made it a point to develop positive 
rapport with both communities here (in South El Monte) and plan to do the same 
in Commerce." 
</P>
<P>
 The only other Latino to have served as city administrator in Commerce's 
34-year history is Ed Oliva, who held the job during the early 1980s, city 
spokeswoman Judy Rambeau said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1990 census, Commerce's population of 12,100 is 91% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an advantage being able to communicate with residents in their own 
language," Romero said. "But I certainly feel I'm also very qualified for the 
job." SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; MAN LOSES LAWSUIT AGAINST 
MCDONALD'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A jury found last week that a Huntington Park McDonald's outlet did not serve 
contaminated food to an HIV-positive man, who claimed a bad sandwich from the 
restaurant lowered his immune system and led to full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Superior Court jury ruled 9-to-3 that the McDonald's franchise 
at 2584 E. Slauson Ave. did not serve Arvin Peterson, 49, a McRib sandwich 
contaminated with shigella bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson's attorney, Natasha Roit, said she would seek to retry the case since 
the jury, which deliberated two weeks, deadlocked on two other claims in the 
suit: whether the restaurant violated state health and safety codes and if it 
destroyed evidence before trial. The evidence in question was related to 
whether one or more McDonald's employees was sick with shigella during the time 
they handled the food Peterson consumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is far from over," Roit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing the McDonald's franchise declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, a former Huntington Park resident now living in Seattle, claimed 
that he contracted shigella after eating the McRib sandwich on March 9, 1992. 
The suit, which sought unspecified damages, said that Peterson vomited and 
suffered severe diarrhea after eating the sandwich, french fries, ice cream and 
a soft drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson was taken the next day by ambulance to the Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center emergency room, where he was diagnosed with the bacterial infection, 
which can be transmitted through contaminated food. 
</P>
<P>
 While hospitalized, Peterson suffered heart fibrillations and his T-cell count 
-- which reflects the health of the body's immune system -- dropped from 
between 500 and 600 to 160, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 A T-cell count below 200 indicates that a person has AIDS. Peterson's attorney 
said he was hospitalized for several days during his illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson did not appear in court due to medical reasons, his attorney said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; PROJECT HAILED AS BOON TO COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Residents and business owners last week heralded a proposal to build a 
$15-million housing and commercial development on South Vermont Avenue as the 
start of a new era for their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The project to develop the lot at 81st Street, where Pepperdine University 
once stood, will be one of the largest in the area in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that should have been done 10 years ago," said Kenneth 
Williams, a third-generation business owner near the former campus. "The 
project will create a new vision of prosperity in the community, as well as a 
shopper-friendly environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Caleb Development Corp., with Solomon Inc. Architecture, were selected to 
develop the 75,000-square-foot parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Watts entrepreneur Rodney Shepard, Caleb Development plans to build 
35 townhomes, which would cost between $125,000 and $150,000, and 10 to 15 
retail outlets in 14,000 square feet of commercial space. The homes will have 
two or three bedrooms each, private yards or large decks and two-car garages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be looking for businesses that are going to produce income 
and energy," said Shepard, adding that high-traffic storefronts such as a 
grocery store or bakery will be preferred over a jewelry store, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vermont Corridor project is expected to create about 200 construction 
jobs, Shepard said. Building will get under way by mid-1995 if loans from First 
Interstate Bank can be bolstered by government financing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the Caleb proposal is restoration of the landmark Pepperdine 
University tower, the only university building remaining after the rest of the 
campus was gutted nearly 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The development group aims at blending the 1931 art deco tower with the 
proposed commercial and housing complex and the nearby Vermont Knolls 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate Bank named seven people, including City Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, area residents and urban planners, to select the winning design 
from 66 concepts. As the winner, Caleb will assume ownership of the land from 
Medhi Bellour and be responsible for maintaining the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and business owners said the corridor has deteriorated over the past 
decade.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one wanted to do business here or stay in business in this area," said 
Williams, owner of Universal College of Beauty, located five blocks south of 
the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaele Pride-Wells, owner of an architecture firm and one of the judges, 
said Caleb's design best met the needs of the community -- needs voiced in 
dozens of community forums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home ownership, community services, jobs . . . this will help the entire 
community as a whole," said Mary Lydia, on the neighborhood development council 
since the inception of the project in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Velma Richardson, executive officer for the African-American Business Assn., 
had a more pragmatic point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "After patronizing First Interstate all these years, the African-American 
community is excited when they bring something back to the community," said 
Richardson, who graduated from Pepperdine before the campus moved to Malibu in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Pride-Wells said one of the key elements in choosing the Caleb proposal was 
its inclusion of the USC Business Expansion Network, an entrepreneurial 
assistance and training program for area business people. The network's office 
will be located in the tower. ENRIQUE LAVIN

 A smile and a hug from a grateful patient is the best Christmas present Brad 
Greenbaum has gotten this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenbaum, a resident surgeon at the Los Angeles Orthopaedic Hospital 
Foundation, operated on a 13-year-old boy from Mexico who had an affliction 
that forced him to walk with his knees bent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought him up here (in mid-October) and I did an operation to 
straighten his knees," said Greenbaum, 29, a USC medical school graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of a team of volunteer doctors from the Orthopaedic Hospital on 
South Flower Street, Greenbaum saw the boy again last week when he flew to 
Calexico, Calif., to treat other crippled children and their families as part 
of the hospital's International Children's Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew I was one of the people that operated on him. When I saw him in the 
clinic, I saw him with his knees straight," said Greenbaum, adding that the boy 
raced to greet him. "He had a huge smile on his face. . . . He gave me a hug 
and said 'thank you' (in Spanish)." 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the only gracias Greenbaum received on the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 He and two other doctors treated 125 children in two days at the hospital's 
Calexico satellite clinic on the international border. Through its program, 
composed of a staff of five doctors and eight to 10 volunteers and funded by 
private donors, the hospital has been treating about 2,000 patients a year for 
the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of volunteers go to Calexico once a month to screen patients and 
provide X-rays, casting and bracing services. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the trips is to help Mexican children who cannot afford 
advanced medical attention, said Mary Beth McKee, one of the program's 
organizers. All services provided by the volunteers are free. Children who need 
corrective surgery are taken to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were families coming anywhere from Mexicali up to families that have 
traveled more than 40 hours to see us," said Greenbaum. The group's next trip 
will be Jan. 13-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Greenbaum: "It's gratifying to know that we can help someone that would 
otherwise spend the rest of their lives with these deformities." ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; $56.5 MILLION OKD FOR REDEVELOPMENT PLAN

<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved a $56.5-million redevelopment 
project for the Broadway-Manchester area that will include a commercial center 
and housing development for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial center will be built on the southwest corner of Broadway and 
Manchester Avenue, said Roy Willis, the Community Redevelopment Agency's 
director of operations.Construction of the center, up to 200,000 square feet, 
is set to begin in early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 A 65-unit apartment complex is planned for senior citizens at 94th Street and 
Broadway, next to an additional 15,000 square feet of retail space. 
</P>
<P>
 The 180-acre redevelopment area is bounded by the Harbor (110) Freeway on the 
west, 84th Street on the north, Central Avenue on the east and 102nd Street on 
the south. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure community interests were not undermined, officials said, the CRA 
worked closely with Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, local merchants, residents 
and community leaders to draft the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Will T. Washington, who helped draft the plan, said the 21-member 
advisory committee was seeking development of a supermarket, movie theater and 
a strip of specialty shops such as a dry cleaners, a pharmacy, a Laundromat, a 
bookstore and a hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the proposal is to coordinate a Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
bus route for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary source of financing will be a tax increment specifically for the 
redevelopment project. Other funds will come from the city and from investors, 
project manager Oscar Jauregui said.ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; DIRECTOR SELECTED FOR AUTO-SKILLS CENTER

<P>
 A year and a half after opening its doors, the Los Angeles Urban League 
Automotive Training Center has named Alfred Howard, a Crenshaw district native 
and retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, as permanent director. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard replaces acting director John Saia, a Toyota U.S.A. technical training 
professional who had been on loan from the Torrance-based company since the 
center was launched April, 1993, as a joint effort by the Urban League and 
Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard will oversee all operations at the Crenshaw Boulevard center, which has 
been lauded by dignitaries ranging from Los Angeles City Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas to Prince Charles as a model jobs-training program. The center 
has taught 160 students such auto repair skills as brakes, suspensions and air 
conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, 49, said he looks forward to helping people in the community where he 
grew up and now lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled," said Howard, a graduate of Dorsey High. "I have a background 
in administration, personnel training, teaching, automotive repair . . . Now 
I'll be finally able to put them all together." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Army, Howard was a helicopter pilot and vehicle maintenance supervisor, 
and most recently worked as a teacher at 112th Street School in Watts. That 
experience, he said, segues well into his new position at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something I've always wanted to do is teach in the community I grew up in, to 
help the people I know," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Howard, like many other residents, said he routinely passed by the center 
after it opened wondering what was going on at the site, formerly an auto 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he is familiar with the center's history and operations, Howard said 
one of his priorities is to step up student recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also looking to increase the number of employment partners -- auto 
repair businesses that agree to consider hiring graduates of the center. 
Twenty-six of the 30 most recent graduates have landed jobs -- the employment 
rate is regularly 90% or higher -- but Howard says he wants to do better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to develop a waiting list of employers. A satisfactory performance on 
my end is having everyone employed . . . Students learn a lot of skills here, 
not just automotive work. We want everyone to have a place to go." ERIN J.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; BLACK GALLERY ATTACKS VANDALISM HEAD-ON

<P>
 Under siege by young vandals, Black Gallery Director Roland Charles is 
launching an offensive of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 After both front windows of his fine art photography galley were broken in 
four separate incidents, Charles decided to strike back with "Art Attack."The 
fund-raising and arts education project will begin today with an art sale from 
11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the gallery, 107 Santa Barbara Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Items from $5 to $125 will be offered, including limited edition prints, 
posters, lithographs and cards. Proceeds will go toward repairing the gallery's 
windows as well as installing protective coverings and a security system. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles, a photojournalist who co-founded the gallery 10 years ago, also plans 
to start photography classes at nearby Audubon Middle School, Dorsey and 
Crenshaw high schools and other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only through education and appreciation of the arts, he said, that young 
people can understand the importance of supporting a community institution such 
as his. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Black Gallery client Patricia Bath said she volunteered to be the 
project's spokeswoman because of the many contributions the gallery has made to 
the community. Bath, an ophthalmologist and View Park resident, is approaching 
politicians and others about securing funds for the building repairs and 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very important, very vibrant force in the neighborhood," she said. 
"It's really tragic when the community seeks to destroy rather than edify it. . 
. . We want to give kids a chance to express their hurt, their pain through 
photos, not vandalism." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; BILINGUAL ARTS GROUP GETS $250,000 GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRETT MAHONEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the recent award of a major federal grant, the Bilingual Foundation of 
the Arts theater group hopes to raise the curtain on a bigger house. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Carmen Zapata, co-founder and producing director of the Bilingual 
Foundation of the Arts, announced earlier this month that her nonprofit Latino 
theater group will receive a $250,000 Department of Housing and Urban 
Development grant as the nucleus of a fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The group aims to raise $7 million for a 300-seat theater by 1998 in the 
vicinity of Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the past 14 years, our home has been the former Lincoln Heights jail, but 
thanks to this much-needed grant, it is time for us to 'get out of jail and 
pass go' into a new facility," said Zapata at a Downtown Los Angeles press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente), a strong supporter of the group, was 
instrumental in securing the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fears and suspicions in a community are directly linked to a lack of 
understanding and a lack of knowledge about one another. BFA, for nearly a 
quarter of a century, has strived to help bridge that gap, provide that 
understanding and that knowledge," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group could better achieve its goal in a larger space, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who show up to see the group's performances without a ticket have to be 
turned away because the intimate, 84-seat theater is usually sold out weeks in 
advance, Zapata said. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing interest in their work gratifies Zapata and her colleagues, 
Margarita Galban and Estella Scarlata, who founded the group in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Zapata met the two women in the early 1970s when they persuaded her to perform 
in a Spanish play they were producing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Spanish was her first language, Zapata was reluctant to take the role 
because she had not used it regularly for years and was afraid she would 
stumble over the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me I was playing a drunk, so people would think I was acting if I 
tripped over the language," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a successful collaboration, the three women decided to continue working 
together. Tired of being ignored by Hollywood because of their Latina surnames, 
they launched their own theater group to celebrate their culture and language, 
said Zapata. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the group mounted productions wherever they could find cheap, available 
space. Later, in 1979, they refurbished the former Lincoln Heights jail as 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
 To stay on their financial feet, they applied for as many public and private 
grants as they could, solicited individual donations and, when forced to, 
reached into their own earnings from acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just knew we wanted to present Hispanic theater, and it just grew and grew 
and took over our lives," Zapata said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, each year the group presents several productions on their own stage and 
performs at Los Angeles area schools. They serve an annual audience of nearly 
200,000 adults and children. 
</P>
<P>
 From modern works such as Federico Garcia Lorca's "Yerma" to 15th Century 
dramas like "La Celestina," the group's stage is host to a trove of Latino and 
Spanish classics, performed in English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to fostering Hispanic talent -- writers, directors and 
actors. ('Untouchables' star) Andy Garcia's first job in Los Angeles was with

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; BUDDING MUSICIANS OFFERED FREE TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Music Center is offering talented young musicians an opportunity to train 
for free with members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and other guest artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be an aspiring orchestral performer; we are encouraging 
everyone to apply that could possibly benefit from the program," said Cheryl 
Hall, program administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Music Center Education Division is accepting applications for the 1995 
Corwin Seminars.

<P>
 The program gives musically inclined 16- to 25-year-olds insights on audition, 
practice and performance techniques used by professional musicians; 
professional critiquing of solo and concerto repertoire, and instruction on how 
to maximize their artistic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only those students with advanced training will be allowed to perform 
during the seminar, Hall said, beginning musicians as well as music teachers 
are welcome to audit the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is sponsored by the family and friends of Sherril C. Corwin, a 
philanthropist and member of the boards of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the 
Music Center, who died in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 47 musicians participated in the program; 122 peopleaudited it.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK; GROUP SEEKS TO NAME SCHOOL FOR ADVOCATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Evelyn Thurman Gratts is not known as "Mrs. Belmont" in the halls of Belmont 
High School for nothing.  
</P>
<P>
 And with a campaign to name a new elementary school in her Echo Park 
neighborhood after her, residents and friends are hoping she gets the 
recognition she deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is the ultimate volunteer, she is an incredible person," said former 
Mayor Tom Bradley, who once lived in Echo Park and has been friends with Gratts 
for decades. "Whether it comes to the schools or the City Council -- she just 
can't give enough,"  
</P>
<P>
 The Echo Park Coordinating Council is leading the effort to name Belmont 
Elementary School No. 5, at 3rd and Lucas streets, after Gratts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the right way to honor a woman who has worked so much for the 
schools," council member Jacques Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is encouraging those who support the proposal to send letters to 
the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 From bringing Head Start to the school district to organizing a parent group 
to ward off gang fights on campus to lobbying for a school swimming program to 
consistently speaking out at school board meetings, Gratts has spent most of 
her 87 years fighting for one cause or another in the halls of Union 
Elementary, Virgil Junior High and Belmont High schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been an organizer. I used to organize the kids for marble games 
and softball games when I was growing up," Gratts said. 
</P>
<P>
 She attributes her civic dedication to her family roots, which run deep in the 
community. Gratts was baptized in Echo Park Lake after her grandparents settled 
in the area in 1885. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents and grandparents, all of whom worked to improve their 
neighborhood, laid the path for her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With her keen intellect, she could have become "a high-powered attorney," said 
Ignacio Garcia, Belmont High's assistant vice principal. Instead, after 
graduating from Belmont High in the 1920s, Gratts became a volunteer advocate 
for local children. And many are grateful she did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of an issue she hasn't been involved in. She has made this 
community a better place to live in so many ways," said Maryanne Hayashi, 
executive director of Central City Action, a youth recreation group. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least once, her enthusiasm got her into a little hot water with her own 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 During a Belmont High track meet one year, Gratts, a trained masseuse, was 
called down from the stands to assist an injured runner from the opposing team. 
He ended up nosing out her son at the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 But her children, who respectfully answer Gratts with "Yes, ma'am" and "No, 
ma'am," don't bear a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt my mother was my best friend," said her daughter, Tommie 
Mallet. "Not only do I love her, I like her." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the whole family has adopted the local schools. There have been few 
years since the Belmont schools opened in the 1920s that at least one of 
Gratts' family members, one of her four brothers, four children, 13 
grandchildren or 19 great-grandchildren, have not been enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gratts strolls through the school halls, few of the teen-age students can 
believe she is an octogenarian and, with a twinkle in her amber eyes, she often 
dares her many admirers, "Guess how old I am?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gratts' activism doesn't stop outside the school doorsteps. She is a senior 
representative to the Los Angeles City Human Relations Commission, and despite 
recently recovering from heart surgery, Gratts was busily taking calls and 
issuing orders to prepare for the Westlake Hills Senior Citizen's 20th 
anniversary Christmas lunch. She is the president and founder of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will decide on a name for the Belmont Elementary No. 5 in the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Echo Park Coordinating Council is encouraging those who support naming the 
school the "Evelyn Thurman Gratts Elementary School" to write letters to Sid 
Thompson, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, 450 N. 
Grand Ave., Room 223, Los Angeles, Calif. 90012. BRETT MAHONEY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WILSHIRE; OFFICERS EXCHANGE SQUAD CARS FOR BIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two wheels can sometimes be better than four when it comes to patrolling the 
busy Wilshire corridor, as police are finding out.  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning last month, Los Angeles Police Department Officers Blake Budai and 
Steve Crane -- both former squad car patrolmen -- became the Wilshire 
Division's first bicycle officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedaling through heavy traffic and down side streets and alleys from 10 a.m. 
to 6:45 p.m., the officers find that increased mobility puts them closer to 
merchants and residents from Koreatown on the east to the Beverly Center on the 
west. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're much more in touch with the community now," said Budai, who covers 20 
to 25 miles a day. "You see a lot more on a bike than you do in a patrol car." 
</P>
<P>
 Two specially equipped mountain bikes costing $1,200 each were provided 
through donations made earlier this year to the Wilshire Community Police 
Council, a fund-raising unit for the division. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers received extensive training, said Capt. Lyman Doster, who 
supervises the unit. Although money for the bikes was donated, the men -- who 
cycle in their spare time -- each paid close to $200 for helmets and other 
personal gear. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial run of the bike unit has yielded good results so far, Doster said. 
Several arrests have already been made by the bike patrolmen who have the 
ability to pedal up silently behind unwary suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The most spectacular arrest made so far by the bike patrol was the capture of 
a thief in the vehicle he had just stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was about 5 p.m., rush hour, and the guy got stuck in traffic," Budai 
said. "We got the call and were the first unit there. There wasn't even a 
pursuit." 
</P>
<P>
 A squad car could have easily become entangled in the rush-hour snarl. 
</P>
<P>
 Six more Wilshire Division officers have completed bike training, Budai said, 
but the division needs more donations to buy more bikes.  
</P>
<P>
 The Wilshire Community Police Council may be contacted by calling the 
division's senior lead office at (213) 485-4020. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; CITY DEMOLISHING LANDMARK HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Demolition crews began tearing down the historic Californian Hotel last week 
after it sustained severe structural damage in a Nov. 28 fire allegedly begun 
by transient squatters trying to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Shut down in July after the city issued several citations for building and 
safety violations, the five-story 1920s masonry structure at 1907 W. 6th St. 
has been the site of three fires in five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income families had been living in the pest-infested 200-unit structure 
under slum conditions, surrounded by fire hazards, said Tony Perez, press 
deputy for Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez, who oversees the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Squatters had occupied some of the building's vacant units under the blind eye 
of management, and drugs were sold in and around the building, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several efforts were made by the city to contact the hotel's absentee 
owners so they could correct the problems, they were not found. After its 
residents were relocated, the building was boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez had hoped the city could find the owners so they could either fix 
the building themselves or allow the city to take over, make repairs and 
preserve the building for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the search for the owners continued, the abandoned building continued 
to deteriorate. Although Perez said the hotel was securely boarded, transients 
broke in and took up occupancy. As temperatures began to drop, the squatters 
began trying to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 After the most recent fire, the old hotel was rendered an irreparable hazard, 
and a motion to destroy it was unanimously approved by the City Council.  
</P>
<P>
 For now, the city will absorb the cost of demolition until the owners are 
found, Perez said. There are no immediate plans for the site. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; RESIDENTS URGED TO SURRENDER GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and Supervisor Gloria Molina have 
asked residents to turn in guns -- no questions asked -- to any sheriff's 
station in hopes of reducing gun violence over the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said he hopes the "Season of Peace" drive, which ends Jan. 12, collects 
more weapons than an effort last spring in which 100 guns were turned in from 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the guns turned in last spring had been reported stolen, but none had 
been used in a crime, Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort was announced Monday at the Sheriff's Community Center in East Los 
Angeles because of the number of gang shootings in the area, he said. "That's 
where we've had the greatest increase in gang homicides." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of murders reported so far this year in the area covered by the 
East Los Angeles station is 43, compared to 34 last year, said Capt. Ramon C. 
Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now more than ever, our community is confronted by juveniles armed with guns. 
Unfortunately, young people who carry weapons may be associated with violent 
street gangs and may become involved in drive-by shootings," Block and Molina 
wrote in a letter to 1st Supervisorial District residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter cites unspecified studies contending that a child associated with 
gangs is 60 times more likely to be murdered than non-gang members and urges 
anyone who wishes to turn in a weapon to call the sheriff's station first. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents should place the gun in the trunk of their car and then go into the 
station and ask for a deputy to come and retrieve it from the vehicle, Molina 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive is being made without financial incentives, Block said, because he 
did not want to entice people to go out and buy guns in order to get the 
rewards. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; RALLY STAGED LAUDING CLINIC'S 187 
POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than 40 residents gathered last week at the Casa Maravilla housing 
project to support staff members from a nearby clinic who have vowed to 
disregard Proposition 187's provision that they verify patients are in the 
country legally. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally Wednesday was the second in as many months held for staff members at 
the county-operated Edward R. Roybal Comprehensive Health Center, said Dr. Jack 
Kent, who has worked at the clinic for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate the community's support," Kent said. "We need unity, especially 
in the Latino community. If there is community support, it (Proposition 187) 
will be difficult to implement." 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Maravilla residents said they attended the rally to support opposition to 
Proposition 187, which would deny most public services, including non-emergency 
medical aid, to illegal immigrants. Voters overwhelmingly approved the 
initiative in November, but it has not gone into effect pending several court 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 staff members signed a petition two months ago saying they would 
never enforce the law, a provision of which compels health workers in publicly 
funded clinics to refuse services to suspected illegal immigrants who cannot 
prove legal residency. Employees would also have to report any undocumented or 
suspected undocumented persons to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want them to be looking at whether we're documented or not," said 
Isidro Olmos, who serves on the Casa Maravilla Resident Advisory Council. "We 
just support them for saying they will not report us to Immigration. We have 
unconditional support of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent said he has not noticed a drop in patients in the adult services area, 
where he works, but doctors are reporting a drop in prenatal appointments. MARY

THE FRAMING OF JOE BURROWS; THE STORY THAT SENT HIM TO DEATH ROW FOR MURDER 
CHANGED MANY TIMES FROM THE DAY IT WAS TOLD BY HIS ACCUSER, A WOMAN KNOWN FOR 
HER CONVINCING LIES. BUT THE JUSTIC SYSTEM HAD DECIDED HE WAS GUILTY, AND IT 
TOOK A LAWYER'S BOND WITH A SOCIOPATH TO SET HIM FREE.

By BARRY SIEGEL, Barry Siegel, a Times national correspondent, is the author of 
A Death in White Bear Lake and Shades of Gray, both published by Bantam Books. 
His last article for this magazine described a South Carolina hospital that

<P>
 When Circuit Court Judge John Michela and Death Row convict Joe Burrows warily 
faced each other in a Kankakee County, Ill., courtroom on Sept. 8, it was by no 
means their first encounter. In the spring of 1989, Michela had presided over 
Burrows' two trials on first-degree murder charges. The first trial had ended 
in a deadlocked jury; the second had ended in Burrows' conviction. The same two 
eyewitnesses -- a small-time cocaine dealer and a scared, dim 22-year-old -- 
had composed the sum of the state's case at both trials. The difference was, 
the jurors at the second trial believed them.  
</P>
<P>
 It had mattered little to Michela what he thought of this result. It had 
mattered little to Michela that he found the coke dealer, Gayle Potter, to be 
utterly unbelievable and wasn't sure if the 22-year-old, Ralph Frye Jr., even 
knew what he was saying. What had mattered to Michela -- all that mattered -- 
was what the jury thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Michela believed powerfully in the notion that jurors alone were the finders 
of act. He would never overrule a verdict or tell a jury he disagreed. Juries 
were the great defense against abuses of power, including his own. If the jury 
chose to believe Ralph Frye and Gayle Potter, that was it for Michela. The jury 
had listened to Frye whine on the witness stand, listened to him go on and on 
and on. It was up to the jury to fathom that, and they'd fathomed that Joe 
Burrows was guilty.  
</P>
<P>
 Not even Joe Burrows' final desperate plea before sentencing -- "I'd like to 
ask the court a question. Just whose job is it to see that justice is done?" -- 
had swayed the judge. Michela sentenced Burrows by the book. He could discern 
no mitigating circumstances, so by Illinois law, Burrows looked to be a 
suitable candidate for the executioner. "It is the judgment of this court," 
Michela had proclaimed on Aug. 1, 1989, "that this defendant be hereby 
sentenced to death."  
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost exactly five years later, Burrows was back before him, 
expressionless at the defense table, handcuffed at his wrists, shackled at his 
waist and ankles. Sitting behind him, family and friends were nervously inching 
forward in their seats. Standing at his side, defense attorney Kathleen Zellner 
was talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot cite any precedent for Your Honor because there is none," she was 
saying. "Maybe that should tell us something about the enormity of the tragedy 
played out in this courtroom... . It is time for the truth to prevail in this 
courtroom."  
</P>
<P>
 The words had to grate on Michela. I don't get into truth, the judge liked to 
observe. It's what's provable that matters. You have to separate what you 
believe from the facts. Faith is for Sundays.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for these shackles to come off," Zellner was saying. "I am asking 
Your Honor to grant my motion because it is right and just. It is time, Your 
Honor, to send Mr. Burrows home." 
</P>
<P>
 From Death Row to freedom in a morning -- the notion left the lawyers in 
Michela's courtroom full of wonder. But so did all that had emerged since the 
day Michela condemned Burrows. Over four days in late July, at a special 
hearing in Michela's courtroom, they'd all listened, transfixed, to a cascade 
of revelations. With the hearing over, Michela no longer needed look to a jury. 
Finally, it was his judgment that mattered. He did not hesitate. He nodded at a 
prison guard, who began fumbling to remove Burrows' manacles and leg irons. A 
moment later, the chains clanged to the courtroom floor, echoing to the high 
ceiling. Burrows' wife, Sherri, rushed into his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has followed this extraordinary moment in an Illinois courtroom. The 
Burrows family has celebrated, the murder victim's family has wept, the news 
media, TV talk shows and movie producers have scrambled. Judge Michela has been 
hailed, Kathleen Zellner cheered, the legal system studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the story is not over. Despite her victory, Zellner plans to appeal 
Michela's ruling. She admires what she calls the judge's "gutsy" decision, but 
she laments what she regards as Michela's reluctance, in his ruling, to 
acknowledge just how an innocent man came to spend five years on Death Row. She 
wants responsibility fixed. She wants it understood that judges and prosecutors 
and defense attorneys must look to themselves, not the legal system's thicket 
of rules and procedures, for justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge," Zellner maintains, "is not facing up to what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 William Dulin's body, clad in long johns, lay face up on his living room floor 
for 36 hours before his daughter Patricia discovered it at 8 a.m. on Nov. 8, 
1988. Called soon after to Dulin's farmhouse in a remote reach of central 
Illinois' Iroquois County, about nine miles east of Watseka and 75 miles south 
of Chicago, state crime scene technician Tommy Martin found no signs of forced 
entry and no fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 A walk through the house did yield some evidence, though. Two holes and two 
deflection marks suggested that four shots had been fired toward the ceiling 
and walls. Dulin's broken fingernails and drops of blood suggested a struggle. 
A .22-caliber bullet in Dulin's neck suggested a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all authorities had until a bearded man with dark bushy hair, wearing 
a shirt embroidered with the name "Chuck" and "K & C Auto," walked into the 
Iroquois Farmers State Bank early that afternoon. He wanted to cash a yellow 
counter check for $4,050 -- a check that had William Dulin's signature on it. 
Iroquois County was too small and self-contained for such a maneuver. The 
bank's 86-year-old chairman had known Dulin for 70 years, and considered him a 
good friend. So had others at the bank. Dulin, a small, frail man, born in the 
first year of the century, had worked in factories as a youth, then settled 
into farming. He'd been known as "the apple man" because of the fruit and cider 
he sold from his small orchard.  
</P>
<P>
 Bank teller Vesta Metz realized at a glance that the signature on the check 
wasn't Dulin's. She also knew what had happened to Dulin; after all, there'd 
been just five murders in 13 years in Iroquois County. "I'm sorry, sir, we 
can't cash this check," she said. "This gentleman was found dead this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials were dialing the Iroquois County Sheriff's office even as their 
visitor rushed to his car. Twenty minutes later, five miles west on County Road 
1200, Sgt. Randy Eimen and Investigator Robert George stopped a black 
Oldsmobile Cutlass that fit the description provided by the bank. Inside were 
the bank customer, Chuck Gullion, and a short, heavyset 32-year-old woman with 
a round face, close-cropped blond hair and the prim manner of a schoolmarm. 
Gayle Potter had a bloody cut on the back of her neck and bruises behind her 
left ear, but no check. Halfway down the road, she'd torn it in four pieces, 
set the pieces on fire and tossed the ashes out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, hello, Gayle," Investigator George said, standing on the car's 
passenger side.  
</P>
<P>
 The two knew each other fairly well. Two years before, George had been obliged 
to bring Potter back to Illinois from Texas to face auto-theft and forgery 
charges; on the plane ride home, they'd talked all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, past brushes with the law made Potter's a familiar face to all those 
at the Iroquois County Jail -- Eimen, George, Sheriff Joseph Mathy, State's 
Attorney Tony Brasel -- who gathered that day to question her. At first, Potter 
denied any connection to Dulin's murder, insisting that the old man had given 
the check to her companion for home repairs he'd done. Then, crying, she said 
she might have "set Dulin up" by leading others to believe he had lots of 
money. Finally, she allowed that yes, they might find her fingerprints at 
Dulin's house, but she didn't shoot Dulin. She'd stolen the check from him 
three months before, while helping him clean his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some dispute about what next transpired. Sheriff Mathy says he simply 
told Potter that she was lying, and "the only way you can help yourself in this 
deal is to tell us what happened." Gayle Potter recalls being told they were 
going to "fry me like a piece of chicken" if she didn't talk. Potter also 
recalls being told that "I had better come up with somebody who did that murder 
or it was all going to fall on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever was said, by evening Potter indeed had come up with somebody: Joe 
Burrows, helped by his young sidekick Ralph Frye. 
</P>
<P>
 She knew Dulin, Potter told the investigators that evening, because her mother 
had taken care of Dulin's late wife. Dulin sometimes lent money to Potter. On 
Nov. 6, the night of the murder, she needed money: She was a drug dealer and 
owed her supplier $3,000 for cocaine. At a 9 p.m. meeting at a Mobil station in 
Urbana, the supplier threatened her. So did the supplier's "collector" -- Joe 
Burrows. Both had yanked her around and pistol-whipped her. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrows, knowing of her friendship with "the rich old farmer," suggested she 
borrow the money from him. Then Burrows and Frye forced her into a Chevy pickup 
truck -- a blue pickup with rusted doors and primer spray and a missing front 
grill -- and drove 65 miles north to Dulin's home. Once there, the two men 
pushed their way into the house with her. When Dulin refused her request for a 
$3,000 loan, Burrows pulled a gun -- a .22 revolver with a wooden handle and a 
five-inch barrel -- and ordered Dulin to write a check. Burrows and Dulin began 
struggling. She tried to stop Burrows, but Frye knocked her to the ground. She 
heard shots fired. She turned to see Dulin drop to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Potter said, the men shoved her into the truck. Burrows handed 
Frye the revolver, went back in to wipe off fingerprints and came back out five 
minutes later with Dulin's pants, BB gun and personal papers. Burrows and Frye 
drove her back to Urbana. Before leaving her at her trailer, they beat her and 
warned that she still needed to come up with the money. That was why she'd sent 
Chuck Gullion to cash the check. Gullion, she explained, was the one who'd run 
up her $3,000 cocaine debt.  
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear why Iroquois County authorities, after listening to this fertile 
and ever-shifting story, so readily embraced it on the first day of their 
murder investigation. To be fair, Potter did not mention that the .22-caliber 
revolver used to kill Dulin belonged to her. Or that she had called Dulin at 
3:51 p.m. that day and arranged to visit him, hours before Burrows was said to 
have forced her into his pickup. Or that she disliked Joe Burrows because his 
brother, who lived five doors down in her trailer park, had blamed him for a 
recent burglary at her trailer. Or that since age 15, psychologists had been 
saying her "sugary sweet" manner concealed "an extremely effective manipulator" 
full of "untrue, bizarre stories."  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, authorities would not have needed Potter's help in these matters if 
they had tried independently to verify her story. They did not, however, even 
though they knew she had a rap sheet and a cocaine habit. Instead, they swung 
into action. 
</P>
<P>
 By midnight, Sgt. Eimen and Investigator George were on the road south to 
Burrows' home in Villa Grove. By 12:45 a.m. they and the state police had 
surrounded the home with shotguns, and were pounding on the door. By 1 a.m., 
Burrows was spread-eagled on his living room floor, insisting that he didn't 
know a Bill Dulin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you out of your f------ minds?" he inquired. "Where the hell is Iroquois 
County?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Gayle Potter, Burrows, then 35, looked like a criminal. Tall and burly 
at six feet and 200 pounds, he had tattoos and crooked teeth and an uneducated 
manner of speech. He'd bounced among foster homes as a boy, skipped school 
often and worked sporadically as a self-employed house painter. A former Villa 
Grove police chief recalled the young Burrows as "ornery" and occasionally "a 
troublemaker." He'd spent 10 of the previous 15 years in prison for three 
felony burglaries, one felony possession of burglary tools and one misdemeanor 
theft. But none of his crimes had ever involved violence. Nor did anything 
investigators find at Burrows' home early Nov. 9 suggest he'd turned to 
violence. Burrows had not a scratch on him, nothing that would suggest he'd 
been in a struggle hours before. He had two vehicles in his driveway, but 
neither was a blue pickup.  
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the investigators felt they had their man. The interrogation back 
at the local county jail took just seven minutes, by Burrows' count. 
</P>
<P>
 By 4 a.m., Eimen and local deputies were banging on the door of Burrows' 
friend, Ralph Frye, at Ehler's Trailer Park in Urbana. Minutes later, the 
sergeant was handcuffing Frye and reading him his rights. By 5 a.m, Frye was in 
the booking room of the local county jail, listening to Robert George say he'd 
killed an old man named Dulin up in Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
 This is all wrong, Frye tried to say. Where the hell is Sheldon? Where the 
hell is Watseka? 
</P>
<P>
 It is not hard to see how Frye might have had some trouble with his geography 
that morning. For one thing, he was groggy, both from being awakened and from 
the sleeping pills and painkillers doctors had given him two days earlier for 
severe stomach cramps. For another thing, even when wide awake, Frye was not 
particularly bright. 
</P>
<P>
 Frye was sallow-skinned and slight, 5-foot-8 and 150 pounds, with 
shoulder-length dark brown hair, thick glasses and a sparse mustache. Found to 
have a learning disability, he'd spent most of his public schooling in 
special-education classes and was eventually assessed as having a "borderline" 
IQ of 76. A school psychologist thought Frye a "rather pleasant boy" who "wants 
to do well" but "does not have sufficient ability to achieve successfully at 
the high school level." He dropped out in the 11th grade, found occasional jobs 
at fast-food restaurants and smoked marijuana at every opportunity. At the time 
of his arrest for Dulin's murder, he was on probation in Champaign County, 
having pleaded guilty to a $48 burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know where Watseka is," George told Frye that morning of Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did nothing wrong," Frye insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know you were there," George replied.  
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Sgt. Eimen left the room, leaving George alone with Frye. There is 
much dispute now over precisely what happened during the 30 or so minutes that 
George and Frye were together.  
</P>
<P>
 Frye says George "got up in my face" and "threatened to lock me up for a very 
long time." Frye says George -- -who is about 5-foot-7 and 300 pounds -- told 
him what to say, detail for detail, then turned on a tape recorder. George 
signaled with head shakes "whenever I messed up," Frye says, and stopped the 
tape several times so he could adjust his story.  
</P>
<P>
 George says none of this happened -- he didn't threaten, didn't get in Frye's 
face, didn't point a finger, didn't feed Frye his story. He didn't "recall" 
stopping the tape -- "it would have been possible that I did" -- but at any 
rate he never signaled Frye with head shakes. Frye simply confessed, on his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever is the more accurate account, it is undeniable that at two minutes 
before 6 a.m., the corpulent investigator emerged from the interrogation room 
with Ralph Frye's taped statement in hand. Although Frye had an alibi -- his 
girlfriend's mother and brother both would later testify they saw him the on 
the night of Dulin's murder -- in his statement he readily placed himself at 
the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Frye says near the start of this tape. Yes, he drove up to Iroquois 
County on Sunday, Nov. 6. He rode to Dulin's house in a blue pickup truck, 
"somewhat banged up," with Joe Burrows and Gayle Potter. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it night or daytime when you went there? George asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daytime, nighttime," Frye responds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nighttime," George affirms. 
</P>
<P>
 The story Frye then tells eventually would become the core -- if not the total 
-- of the prosecution's case. Despite all the discord connected with this march 
to Death Row, virtually everyone involved -- the lawyers, the sheriff, the 
trial judge, the state Supreme Court -- now agree that Ralph Frye's taped 
statement convicted Joe Burrows.  
</P>
<P>
 Once they were in Dulin's house, Frye says on this tape, Potter started 
yelling when the old man wouldn't loan her money. Then Burrows started punching 
the old man. Frye protested, but Burrows shoved him aside. They were in a 
hallway. Burrows pulled out a revolver -- it looked like a .38 -- and began 
beating Dulin with it. When the old man grabbed for Burrows' arm, two shots 
were fired into the air. Burrows and the old man struggled, both of their hands 
on the gun. The gun fired. The old man fell to his knees. Burrows hit him, 
knocked him out, took his pants, wallet, checks and gold money clip. Driving 
away in the blue pickup, Burrows rifled through the old man's pants, then threw 
them out the window. Frye was sure about that -- Burrows threw the pants out 
the window about three miles outside of town. Back home in Champaign County, 
Burrows drove out a dead-end road on the far side of Willard Airport and dumped 
the pickup into a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point near the end of his taped statement, Frye's account suggests a 
total of three shots. There were, however, five shots evident at Dulin's house. 
Whether George knew this as he questioned Frye, whether crime technician Tommy 
Martin had mentioned it while at Dulin's house, remains an issue. On the tape, 
though, it seems clear that the number of shots concerns George. When Frye 
finishes his narrative, George poses a critical question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, thinking about it, Ralph," George asks, "how many shots were fired in 
the residence?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph replies: "Two to the ceiling, altogether there must have been five 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 George: "Five shots, fired."  
</P>
<P>
 Ralph: "Yeah, because two of them went in the ceiling and one of them went 
into the old man. No, three of them went into the ceiling, yeah ... There were 
four shots before the old man, it ricocheted off the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there anything else, Ralph?" George asks as Frye finishes his account. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Frye responds, "except for that I hope that this is taken care of right 
away. I don't know what the hell is going on. I know what is going on, but this 
is very unusual for me." 
</P>
<P>
 There were, of course, some discrepancies between Gayle Potter's and Ralph 
Frye's stories. Potter mentioned no physical beating; Frye had Burrows beating 
Dulin in the face with his fists and the gun. Potter said it was a .22 
revolver, Frye a .38. Potter said she tried to intervene, Frye said he did. 
Fundamentally, though, Potter and Frye had told the same story. Frye had 
provided the critical corroboration to Potter's tale. He'd also provided 
details Potter hadn't mentioned and the police insisted that they hadn't known 
-- the money clip, the pants, the holes in the ceiling, the number of shots. 
How could Frye, awakened from a drugged sleep, match Potter's story so closely, 
without ever talking to her? How could Frye know what even the police didn't 
know? Above all, why would Frye say he was at the murder scene if he was not?  
</P>
<P>
 Frye's statement, the Illinois Supreme Court would observe three years later, 
"was particularly telling ... He can hardly be considered someone who was not 
present at the time the crime occurred ... Frye's testimony was very probative 
of defendant's guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 By 6 p.m. on Nov. 9, Frye, Potter and Burrows had all been booked into the 
Iroquois County Jail on charges of first-degree murder and armed robbery. 
There, five days later, using the phone available to all prisoners in her 
upper-center cellblock, Potter called her boyfriend, Rick Gillespie, with whom 
she shared a trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gun's in the trailer, behind the chair at the front door," Potter 
whispered. "You need to get rid of it. You need to get rid of that gun." 
</P>
<P>
 It took just eight days for Gayle Potter's and Ralph Frye's stories to start 
unraveling. On Nov. 17, Investigator George interviewed and took taped 
statements from Chuck Gullion, Potter's partner in the check-cashing caper, and 
Rick Gillespie, Potter's boyfriend. Both flatly contradicted Potter and Frye. 
Potter didn't drive up to Watseka with Burrows and Frye in a blue pickup, they 
informed George. Potter, at her request, drove up with them in Gullion's black 
Oldsmobile Cutlass. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Watseka, Gullion said, they went to the apartment of Potter's cousin. 
Gullion and Gillespie watched TV there while Potter borrowed the black Olds and 
left "to take care of some business." Shortly after midnight, Potter returned, 
dazed and covered with blood from a head wound. Seeing her, Gillespie passed 
out. A drug deal had gone sour, Potter explained. 
</P>
<P>
 In her pocket was more than $250 in cash. In the Oldsmobile, on the floor 
behind the driver's seat, underneath a pair of tan dress pants, were Potter's 
.22 revolver and a black plastic BB gun. While Potter cleaned up, Gullion 
unloaded five fired rounds and four live rounds from the .22 revolver. Later, 
they and Gillespie smoked a bowl of marijuana, then drove back to the Town and 
Country Trailer Park in Urbana. There Potter gathered up the two guns and the 
pants, and with Gillespie walked into their trailer.  
</P>
<P>
 Statements by Potter's cousin and Gillespie precisely matched Gullion's. None 
of them saw Joe Burrows or Ralph Frye that night. None of them heard Potter 
mention Burrows' or Frye's name. None of them knew anything about a blue pickup 
truck. Gillespie, though, did know about the murder weapon. After giving his 
statement, he led George to the garbage-filled vacant lot where he'd hidden 
Potter's .22-caliber pistol.  
</P>
<P>
 Years later, Judge Michela would say that Potter's "inconsistent statements on 
the date of arrest should have raised great doubts as to the truthfulness of 
what she said. To accept her final statement of Nov. 8 as true, once the story 
of the blue pickup proved false, is questionable." Yet that is just what 
prosecutor Tony Brasel did. In fact, Potter and Frye's now-suspect statements 
composed the heart of the case he presented to a grand jury in late November of 
1988. He chose not to introduce Gullion's and Gillespie's contradictory 
accounts. In Brasel's version of events, Gayle Potter still was driving up to 
Watseka with Burrows and Frye in a blue pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Brasel had long been a controversial figure. Elected Iroquois County state's 
attorney in 1980, just two years after passing the bar, he raised eyebrows from 
the start. In his first year, he failed to disqualify himself in two cases 
involving former clients. In his second, he failed to disqualify himself when 
his brother appeared in court on a speeding charge. Eventually, the complaints 
about Brasel grew more serious, mostly involving accusations of excessive zeal 
and dirty tricks and duplicitous double-dealing with other lawyers. By the time 
of Dulin's murder, Brasel apparently had worn out his welcome in Iroquois 
County -- on the day Gayle Potter was arrested, Brasel had lost his bid for 
reelection. He remained on the Dulin case as an appointed "special prosecutor," 
however, because the man who unseated him was then the county's public 
defender, and had represented Potter previously. 
</P>
<P>
 Just why Brasel found Potter so believable from the start, and so quickly 
eliminated her as the murderer, remains a subject of much speculation. Perhaps 
it was Gayle Potter's uncommon wile that drove him -- other lawyers, witnessing 
her courtroom performance, have marveled at "the way Potter was able to lie," 
at how her initial statement and later quite different testimony were spoken 
with "the same sincerity" and "no difference in inflection." If not that, 
perhaps it was excessive prosecutorial zeal, or an abiding belief that Burrows 
was the killer -- "If I felt Burrows was not guilty, I would have never tried 
the case," the prosecutor declared last January, in one of the few comments he 
has offered to journalists. Whatever the impetus, Brasel, in early 1989, began 
trying to weave a single consistent story from the various conflicting 
statements he'd collected. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort surely wasn't harmed when Sheriff Mathy, near the end of January, 
transferred Ralph Frye to a cell next to Gayle Potter's. Mathy -- who, it 
should be noted, was Brasel's campaign manager -- now regrets this arrangement, 
although he calls critics of it "armchair quarterbacks." He also maintains that 
his jail is so small, with just 30 cells on two floors, that wherever he put 
Frye, he could have "yelled back and forth" with either Burrows or Potter. 
Yelling wasn't necessary where Frye ended up, though. Between his cell and 
Potter's was a food slot, through which the two prisoners could, and did, talk 
for hours every day. Potter and Frye describe their conversations in similar 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I scared the living daylights out of Ralph," Potter says. "You need to see 
him. He's borderline retarded, real slow. It was not hard to coerce him. I told 
him, 'They're going to put us on Death Row unless you go along with my story, 
unless you do it Tony's way.' I worked on the details with him over and over." 
Potter grins at the memory. "I convinced him they wouldn't believe he wasn't 
there."  
</P>
<P>
 Frye agrees: " 'We gotta make it sound better, then they'll help us,' she says 
to me. She talked about what to say, what happened, how we got there, how we 
left. We rehearsed. They wanted to make sure it was all consistent. I tried to 
say this was wrong, that I was never there, but what could I do? What could I 
do?"  
</P>
<P>
 Frye went to trial first, in late February in the Iroquois County courthouse, 
with Judge Michela imported from Kankakee County to preside because the local 
judge had a conflict of interest. Frye had no occasion then to demonstrate what 
he'd learned in jail, for his court-appointed defense counsel, Michael Jones, 
didn't call him to the stand. Jones didn't call Frye's alibi witnesses, either, 
or move to suppress Frye's taped statement, even though he was aware of 
Gullion's and Gillespie's contradictory accounts. The jury, after listening to 
Gayle Potter's testimony and Frye's statement, readily convicted him of armed 
robbery and murder. He was not then sentenced and sent to a state prison, 
however. Because of an Illinois rule requiring equal sentences for the same 
crimes, Michela wanted to wait until the others were tried. So Frye remained in 
the Iroquois County jail cell adjacent to Potter's. 
</P>
<P>
 Brasel now also joined in the communications between Potter and Frye, in a 
series of jailhouse meetings allowed, but not attended, by the two prisoners' 
attorneys. Jail logs and Brasel's billing statements show he had 25 meetings 
with Frye and 12 with Potter. Brasel describes these as part of the normal 
preparation for trial; Potter and Frye remember them differently.  
</P>
<P>
 "Brasel was threatening life or 85 years if I didn't cooperate," Potter says. 
"Brasel was promising immunity if I did. As different pieces of evidence were 
discovered and explained to me, I would change the story to fit them... Tony 
Brasel would supply me with the fact and then I had to supply the supporting 
story for it."  
</P>
<P>
 Frye's account is similar: "Brasel was talking about a 35-to-65-year sentence, 
and saying I could help myself. He told me the taped statement wasn't very good 
the way it was stated, so he thought that it would be better if we would 
prepare the wording a little better...I'd say this is wrong, but Brasel would 
say, 'Well, if you don't help me, I can't help you.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Brasel says none of this happened. He denies making threats, offering immunity 
or feeding evidence. He also denies ever meeting with Potter or Frye without 
Sheriff Mathy in the room, even though the jail logs don't always indicate 
Mathy's presence. All he ever asked of his two star witnesses, Brasel says, is 
"the truth." Potter's charges, he flatly declares, "are a lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever is right, by the time Joe Burrows went to trial for the first time in 
mid-March 1989, with Judge Michela once again presiding in Iroquois County, 
Potter's and Frye's initial stories had evolved considerably, and to great 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of Dulin's murder, Potter now testified, she met her drug supplier 
at the Mobil station around 4 in the afternoon, not 9 at night. There, Burrows 
and Frye did not push her into a blue pickup and drive her to Watseka, but 
rather, told her to meet them in a parking lot in Watseka between 10 and 11 
p.m. Potter drove to Watseka with Gullion and Gillespie, dropped them at her 
cousin's apartment, then met Burrows and Frye at the parking lot. The two men 
followed her to Dulin's house, they in a blue pickup, she in the black Olds. 
When the old man let Potter into his house, Burrows and Frye pushed their way 
through the front door. When Dulin refused her request for a loan, Burrows 
pulled a gun and ordered him to write a check. 
</P>
<P>
 To Potter's surprise, the gun Burrows pulled was her own .22-caliber pistol; 
he must have taken it from her trailer. Dulin reached for his BB gun; he and 
Burrows struggled. Potter tried to intervene but Frye forcibly stopped her. 
Burrows shot Dulin in the head. Potter became hysterical and wanted to call the 
police. Burrows held her head over Dulin's desk and pistol-whipped her, causing 
her to bleed on the desk. Burrows placed the murder weapon, Dulin's gun, some 
papers and clothing into a paper sack, put the sack in the black Olds, then 
left with Frye in the blue pickup. Potter returned to her cousin's apartment in 
the Olds, then Gullion drove her and Gillespie back to their trailer in Urbana, 
carrying the paper sack in as he dropped them off. Potter did not know what was 
in the sack. 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible not to notice that Potter's story now was almost entirely 
consistent with Gullion's, Gillespie's and her cousin's statements. So, it 
turned out, was Ralph Frye's. When he took the witness stand, his story had 
changed, too -- in exactly the same manner as Potter's had. In truth, their 
testimony now dovetailed with all the evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 There was in fact no hallway in Dulin's house, so now Frye said he'd made a 
"mistake" about seeing a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder weapon was a .22-caliber, so no longer did Frye think it was a .38. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no evidence of head wounds on the old man, so now Burrows had never 
hit him with his gun or fists. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter's blood had been found on the desk, so now Burrows had beat her head 
against that desk. 
</P>
<P>
 No pants had been found in a three-mile radius of Dulin's home, so now no 
pants had been thrown out a car window. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue pickup had never been found at Willard Airport, so now it had not 
been dumped there. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter's and Frye's testimony did more than just match the evidence, though. 
Their testimony now, critically, resolved the troublesome fact that Potter's 
gun was the murder weapon, and was found at her trailer. Their story explained 
how Potter's gun came into Burrows' possession -- it had been stolen from her 
trailer -- then explained how the gun moved back to Potter's trailer after the 
murder -- Burrows dropped a bag containing it into Gullion's Olds.  
</P>
<P>
 The jurors apparently didn't buy all this. Perhaps they wondered why Burrows 
was unscathed after his struggle with Dulin. Perhaps they wondered why Burrows 
would hand over to Potter the very gun he'd just used to kill Dulin -- and to 
pistol-whip her. Perhaps they wondered how Burrows could be the killer when it 
was Potter's gun, Potter's blood and Potter's effort to cash Dulin's check. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, after 11 hours of deliberation, the jury at Burrows' 
first murder trial hung, unable to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interim between Burrows' first and second trials -- mid-March to 
late May of 1989 -- Frye remained in his cell next to Potter, and continued to 
talk to her and Brasel. But now others began talking to Frye as well. Everyone 
understood that Gayle Potter was an inconsistent if not unbelievable witness; 
everyone understood that Frye's confirmation of Potter's story was critical. 
Everyone also understood that Frye was a weak link, ready to bend either way. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake, the gloves came off. What unfolded in the Iroquois 
County Jail during the spring of 1989 was nothing less than an unvarnished 
battle for control of Ralph Frye's soul. 
</P>
<P>
 In early April, Frye's sister Kim reached him by phone from her home in 
Buffalo. She had received a letter from Joe Burrows' wife, Sherri, who believed 
that Frye was getting "a raw deal." At Sherri's urging, Kim told Frye to call 
Burrows' lawyer Ron Boyer, and write a letter to Judge Michela. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his sister's advice, Frye called the lawyer. There is dispute now 
over just what was said. Frye sometimes "can't remember," and sometimes claims 
Boyer promised to "help him get out of jail" if he wrote a letter. Boyer 
insists he told Frye only that he'd do "whatever he could to get the truth 
out," and that "the truth would exonerate him." Brasel suggests other 
prisoners, one represented by Boyer, egged Frye on. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the impetus, on April 17, Frye wrote to Michela, declaring that he'd 
never been to the murder scene. "Dear Sir, my name is Ralph E. Frye Jr.," he 
began. "I would like to be as honest as I can be. The morning I was arrested... 
I tried to explain I had no idea of what was going on, which is true. The two 
investigators from Watseka were harassing me and telling me some things about 
what happened up there and what was taken from Mr. Dulin's house. I gave them a 
statement to get them off my back... I had no other choice but to cooperate... 
My lawyer believed everything I said on the tape. So I would like to get a new 
attorney if possible... Miss Potter did talk to me and tell me a few things on 
what did happen out there that night. The reason I got on that witness stand to 
testify is the simple fact that I was looking at a very long prison term... My 
life was at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 When Judge Michela received this letter, he promptly appointed a public 
defender to represent Frye. Then the scramble started. Before this new lawyer 
could act, Frye's attorney Michael Jones visited him. Prosecutor Tony Brasel 
stopped by more than once. Ron Boyer maintained phone contact. In this contest, 
only Frye's relatives weren't successful, their efforts to reach him no doubt 
impeded somewhat by two jail log entries, one instructing that "Ralph Frye's 
sister will not be permitted in facility for visitation," the other saying, 
"Advised by Sheriff Mathy if Frye's grandmother brings some candy and cookies, 
to get in touch with the Sheriff." Mathy later testified that he had "no 
independent recollection" of such orders and "no idea" why he would issue them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of what Frye heard in these critical days involved not legal advice but 
rumors that had long informed Iroquois County legal circles. Boyer told Frye 
that Brasel was a drug user; Brasel told Frye that Boyer was an alcoholic. But 
eventually, Frye's advisers managed to focus on legal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 As Frye later recalled it, Jones told him he'd made "a big mistake" in writing 
the letter, that the judge would now give him a lot more time. The prosecutor, 
Frye recalled, asked, "Can't you see what Boyer's doing to you? He's not 
helping you.... He's helping Mr. Joseph Burrows." And Boyer, he remembers, told 
him that it was his testimony that was convicting Burrows. 
</P>
<P>
 Plainly, Frye was overwhelmed. Ten days after writing his letter to the judge, 
he retracted it in a sworn affidavit. Then, 11 days later, he reversed himself 
again, urgently summoning Boyer to a jailhouse meeting, where -- over Sheriff 
Mathy's objection and attempt to block Boyer's entry -- Frye gave a taped 
recantation, denying any involvement. Even as Boyer was taping it, Gayle Potter 
would later testify, she was on the phone advising Brasel "if you want to save 
your case, you'd better get your ass over here." Within minutes of Boyer's 
departure, Brasel was at the jail, huddled with Frye and Mathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, accounts of a meeting vary. Frye says Brasel "was getting upset. 
The man was prancing around the room, he slammed his hands on the desk, he told 
me that if Mr. Burrows walks free, that I could get nailed for the crime." 
Brasel says he calmly told Frye he "wanted to know what the truth was." All 
agree that by the time Brasel left, after an hour-and-a-half conversation, Frye 
yet again had reversed himself. He had decided that his letter to the judge and 
his recantation statement to Boyer were "mistakes." Frye was back to 
corroborating Potter. 
</P>
<P>
 There matters stood when Joe Burrows' second murder trial began in late May of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment he first offered it, Joe Burrows' account of where he'd been 
the day of Bill Dulin's murder had been precise, detailed and unchanging.  
</P>
<P>
 He'd worked on his '78 Chevy cargo van outside his home all day. A friend, 
Murray Kellems, an Urbana garbage-truck driver, had helped him. Around 7:30 
p.m., he and Kellems had driven Burrows' '79 Pinto to Potomac, to visit 
Burrows' brother Dennis. They'd gotten there a little before 9 p.m. His 
brother's girlfriend, Lynn Pine, had answered the door, then shut it in 
Burrows' face, for she didn't like him. Burrows had knocked again, and Dennis 
had let them in. They'd talked and watched television with Dennis, Lynn and 
their visiting friend, Jana West, until just about midnight. Then Burrows and 
Kellems had left, arriving back home about 1:30 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 At Burrows' first trial, defense attorney Ron Boyer had called to the stand 
three of the key people involved in this narrative -- Dennis Burrows, Lynn Pine 
and Murray Kellems. (He was never able to locate Jana West.) All three 
corroborated Burrows' story, but at times, Boyer would observe later, they 
sounded "inarticulate and uneducated and angry." They did not, he believed, 
"make a credible presentation on cross-examination by Mr. Brasel." Kellems, for 
example, grew agitated when Brasel brought up his previous theft and burglary 
convictions, snarling, "What the hell does my past have to do with this trial?" 
More damaging still had been Brasel's questions about just what they'd watched 
on TV that night. When Dennis Burrows said "Gunsmoke," Brasel quickly 
established that "Gunsmoke" wasn't broadcast on Sunday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 For these reasons, as well as a sense that with Frye's recantation on tape, he 
had an "overwhelming" case -- even though Frye now denied that tape -- Boyer 
decided against calling Burrows' alibi witnesses at the second trial. But the 
trial -- held in Michela's own Kankakee County courthouse because the judge had 
tired of commuting to Watseka -- did not unfold as favorably for his client as 
Boyer had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 First, prosecutor Brasel refused to grant Rick Gillespie and Chuck Gullion 
immunity, so these two critical witnesses exercised their Fifth Amendment 
privileges not to testify. Then Gayle Potter embellished her earlier statements 
by testifying that with Bill Dulin on his knees, "crying and out of breath," 
Joe Burrows had "smiled" as he pulled the trigger. (Potter, years later, would 
testify that she'd added this detail because Brasel had told her "I was going 
to have to make the death of Mr. Dulin more graphic ... and more heinous.") 
Probably most damaging, however, was Frye's agitated exchange with Ron Boyer as 
the jury listened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't you tell me that you could also get me out of jail if I had stuck to 
this taped statement?" Frye snapped at Boyer as Burrows' lawyer questioned him 
on the witness stand about his now-denied recantation and renewed support of 
Potter's story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralph, there is no question to you right now," Boyer responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm handing you one." 
</P>
<P>
 "To answer your question, I told you that I would try." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you didn't tell me that, you said you would if I stuck to the taped 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer couldn't effectively respond without resigning as Burrows' attorney and 
testifying; this he declined to do and Michela declined to require. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter that Frye never could offer a reason, other than "pure 
coincidence," why he and Potter had both made the same "mistake" of initially 
saying they'd driven up to Watseka with Burrows in a blue pickup. It didn't 
matter that the brother of Frye's girlfriend swore that Frye, at 10:20 on the 
night of Dulin's murder, opened the door for him at the Urbana trailer they all 
shared. It didn't matter that the now-distraught Boyer, flatly calling "master 
con artist" Gayle Potter the true killer, implored the jury: "Don't you see 
what they are trying to do to Joseph Burrows?" In the end, the jurors chose to 
believe the prosecutor's version of events. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 6, after deliberating three hours, they convicted Joe Burrows of 
first-degree murder. The key, jury foreman Tom Hendrickson would say later, was 
just what the lawyers had expected it would be -- Ralph Frye's corroboration on 
the witness stand of Potter. "I don't see why you'd say you were at a murder 
scene when you weren't," Hendrickson explained. "And how you would know 
evidence police didn't know about." 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors had taken so little time and seemed so certain that Boyer decided 
it would be wiser not to let them determine Burrows' fate. Waiving the right to 
a jury sentencing, he left it to Judge Michela to decide whether Joe Burrows 
should live or die. 
</P>
<P>
 Michela at 56 is a garrulous man, respected in his county and not much 
inclined toward the isolation of a judge's chambers. After 22 years on the 
bench, he remains well-connected with his region's circuit of lawyers and 
law-enforcement officers -- enough so to call Sgt. Eimen "Randy" and Sheriff 
Mathy "Joe." He also remains personally opposed to the death penalty. It is 
hard to say precisely what the judge thought as he faced the momentous question 
handed to him by Ron Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Michela's own comments over the years offer decidedly mixed indications. On 
the bench midway through Burrows' second trial, frustrated over Frye's 
vacillations, he had muttered, "I don't know if this young man was ever in 
Iroquois County until he was brought there on the 9th of November... I'm not 
sure if any of us know the truthfulness of any statement ever given in this 
trial by anybody." At Burrows' sentencing hearing, he spoke of "the 
unwillingness of this court to believe (Gayle Potter's) testimony" and noted 
that the physical evidence "seems to all have been found in the presence and in 
the possession of Gayle Potter." Yet at that same hearing, Michela also talked 
about "the overwhelming situation of a young man ... being awakened in the 
early hours of the morning seemingly not having time ... to fabricate a story 
putting himself at the murder scene and testifying as to what occurred...." And 
this past fall, speaking in his chambers after finally freeing Burrows, Michela 
declared that he'd found Frye "compelling and believable," and because of him, 
would have voted to convict Burrows if he'd been on the jury.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Michela says, it just doesn't matter what he thought. "Even if I'd 
not shared the jury's view," he observes, "I would have sentenced him anyway. 
My belief in the jury system is that unshakable." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's outlook derives from more than simple faith: He regards the jury 
system as a necessity. You need an organized way to separate facts from belief, 
Michela thinks, and that requires a system with precisely defined roles for all 
involved. The police and prosecutors fight to convict, the defense attorney 
fights back for the accused, the judge referees, the jury decides. "You are the 
sole judges of believability of witnesses," he always instructs juries. Did 
citizens instead want the "inquisitorial" system of some European countries, 
where judges assembled the evidence, questioned the witnesses and delivered the 
verdict? Did citizens really want to give this much power to individual 
government officials?  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Burrows, for one, appeared more than willing to do so as he stood before 
Judge Michela at his sentencing hearing on Aug. 1, 1989. The function and moral 
responsibility of judges -- and everyone involved in the legal system -- was 
much on his mind that day.  
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, I'd like to ask the court a question," Burrows began. "Just 
whose job is it to see that justice is done? Is it mine, Mr. Boyer's, Mr. 
Brasel's, or whose? I've asked myself over and over again, isn't there any 
justice in this country? So many people know that I'm innocent, but yet here I 
am about to be sentenced.... Tell me in all honesty that you believe I'm 
guilty.... I don't want to be sentenced to death, but I can't help wondering 
(if it's) preferable to living in a world where such corruption and injustice 
goes unchecked... What can a man in my position say?...I'm ready for you to 
pass sentence on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Michela was ready as well. As he read it, Illinois statutes insisted that if 
first-degree murder convictions met the criteria listed for Death Row cases, 
the penalty was death, unless the defense could establish mitigating 
circumstances. Michela could discern none. This defendant, Michela declared, is 
hereby sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until then, after the tolling of Burrow's fate, were Frye's and Potter's 
cases resolved, and their sojourn in adjoining cells finally ended. In early 
September, Michela sentenced Frye to 23 years and dispatched him to the Logan 
Correctional Center in Lincoln, Ill. Soon after, before another judge, Potter 
was tried and convicted of first-degree murder, forgery and armed robbery, and 
sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 With three convictions and a death penalty -- his first ever -- to show for 
it, Tony Brasel's tenure as Iroquois County special prosecutor finally was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 It was with considerable reluctance that Naperville, Ill., lawyer Kathleen 
Zellner took a phone call one morning in late December of 1992 from Andrea 
Lyon, director of the Capital Resource Center. The center, a branch of the 
Illinois appellate defender's office, specializes in defending indigent Death 
Row clients. Zellner was just finishing up a grueling case for the center 
involving a serial killer. She wanted nothing more than to return to her normal 
practice of business law.  
</P>
<P>
 "How would you like another?" Lyon inquired. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," Zellner replied. "I've had it." 
</P>
<P>
 "But this one is innocent," Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then 43, Zellner was a newcomer to the Death Row defense bar, and a decidedly 
odd one. Raised in Oklahoma by parents who were scientists and liberal 
Democrats, she'd married young, to a man who is now a CitiCorp executive, and 
had evolved into a self-described conservative Republican who supported the 
death penalty. By 1990, after several stops, she was practicing at a small 
business-law firm in Chicago's western suburbs. She was also growing restless. 
</P>
<P>
 Zellner had once dreamed of being an FBI agent and loved investigating. 
Constitutional law also fascinated her. The two interests merged in criminal 
work, so that's what Zellner eventually decided she wanted to do. After reading 
an article about the Capital Resource Center, she called and volunteered to 
handle a death penalty case. It had given her homosexual serial killer Larry 
Eyler, and before long she was weaving, in courtrooms and the news media, a 
Byzantine tale of child prostitutes, pedophiles, prosecutorial misconduct and 
defense attorney conflict-of-interest. She was also fingering a new suspect -- 
a library science professor who'd befriended Eyler. By the time it ended with 
the professor's acquittal and Eyler's death from AIDS, Zellner had opened her 
own practice and more than once had been placed under police protection because 
of multiple death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," Zellner said again to Lyon. "No way." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, she couldn't resist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not expecting you to rely on me saying I'm innocent," Joe Burrows told 
her in their first phone conversation. "Examine my case, examine the record. 
Make up your own mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Following Burrows' suggestion, Zellner grew increasingly astonished. By then 
the record had grown even more dubious than it was on the day Judge Michela 
condemned Burrows.  
</P>
<P>
 In late July of 1991, John Hanlon, a state public defender then representing 
Burrows, had managed to locate Jana West, the visitor whom Burrows had always 
insisted watched TV with them at his brother's house on the night of Dulin's 
murder. In a sworn affidavit, West unequivocally had affirmed that Burrows was 
at his brother's house on the murder night until past midnight. What's more, 
West said she visited Gayle Potter the next day at her trailer, where Potter 
said "she'd killed a man the night before because he had pistol-whipped her." 
West didn't call the police then "because I didn't believe her." West didn't 
come forward when Burrows was charged with murder because she didn't "care for 
him.... That was his problem ... and I didn't want to be involved in it." 
Besides, "I figured everything would be dropped because I know for a fact the 
man was not there at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after Jana West's emergence, Ralph Frye had yet again recanted 
his entire story in another sworn, taped statement. This time, the lawyers had 
made sure there'd be no appearance of coercion or promises; Burrows' attorney 
had arranged the interview through Frye's new appellate attorney, who attended 
and approved the taping. "What I'm telling you people now is the God's honest 
truth," Frye had said. "Nothing is going to change my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Zellner couldn't believe that despite the whole preposterous record before 
her, the Illinois Supreme Court in March, 1992, had upheld Burrows' conviction, 
calling Frye's Nov. 9 statement "particularly telling."  
</P>
<P>
 Frye? Frye's taped statement sounded pathetic to Zellner. It was full of long 
pauses, full of leading questions. Frye didn't know right from left, Frye 
didn't know day from night, Frye could barely get up every day and get his 
pants on straight. Didn't anyone see how ridiculous it was that in his initial 
statement he gave the same lies that Potter gave in hers? Didn't anyone see 
that the cops must have fed him information?  
</P>
<P>
 The cops kept saying Frye gave them things they didn't know -- the money clip, 
the pants, the wallet. But surely Dulin's daughters would've told the cops 
about missing wallets and money clips when they talked that first day; besides, 
none of those things had ever been found. The cops said Frye gave them the 
number of shots, but did he really? In his statement, Frye is talking about two 
shots, he's talking about three shots, then suddenly it's five shots. Are we 
supposed to believe the cops didn't get the number of shots -- in fact, glean 
every possible detail -- from their own crime technician at the murder scene? 
That Frye knew what the technician needed 48 hours to figure out? That Ralph's 
personal vocabulary included the word "ricochet?"  
</P>
<P>
 There was no point hanging an appeal on Frye, though -- Zellner knew that. He 
had flopped back and forth so much he was worthless. So Zellner turned her 
attention where no defense attorney for Burrows had looked before -- Zellner 
turned to Gayle Potter. 
</P>
<P>
 The two first met one morning in late March of 1993, in an interview room at 
the Dwight Correctional Center in Dwight, Ill. Zellner found the short, stocky 
woman to be pleasant, articulate and full of smiles. With her glasses, round 
face and congenial manner, she suggested a librarian to Zellner. But Zellner 
couldn't help noticing that whenever Potter tried to describe an emotion -- 
sorrow about Dulin, for example -- she sounded cold. It was as if she was 
mimicking the sentiment, rather than feeling it.  
</P>
<P>
 Potter would sometimes also veer from her otherwise rational conversation to 
make wild accusations, or to boast about her glamorous life as a big-time coke 
dealer. Conspiracies on the highest levels, cocaine parties with the state's 
top leaders, meetings with the Colombian cartel -- all were related with 
even-voiced calm. She was, Zellner believed, delusional -- a classic sociopath. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Others before Zellner had reached similar conclusions. Potter's record of 
psychiatric care stretches back to the age of 8; by her early teens she'd 
established a pattern of manipulative lying. A report from a junior high school 
psychologist in Camp Lejeune, N.C., describes Potter's history of telling 
"untrue, bizarre stories" -- including one in which she accused her stepfather 
of rape, claimed she was pregnant and talked of getting an abortion. Other 
reports from a clinical psychologist at the Iroquois Mental Health Center, 
written in June of 1970 and 1971, describe Potter as always "giving the 'right' 
answers," but "not being able to fully conceal the hostility which appeared to 
lurk just below the surface." While Potter "at first does not give the 
impression" of having behavioral problems, "one must constantly keep in mind 
that she is an extremely effective manipulator" who "never presents enough 
evidence to actually get in trouble, typical of a sociopathic orientation 
toward life." 
</P>
<P>
 After choking a younger sister and shooting (but only slightly wounding) a 
younger stepbrother that June of 1971, Potter at age 15 ended up a ward of the 
court, which placed her in a special facility for troubled adolescents. By 16 
she was attending a public high school; by 17 she'd borne a daughter; by 19 she 
was a cocaine addict; by 24 she'd lost custody of her daughter; by 30 she was a 
forger and auto thief. At the time of her arrest for Dulin's murder, she was 
under a restraining order that barred her from being within three miles of her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never change my story," Potter announced to Zellner that first morning. 
But Zellner could tell -- Potter was enjoying the attention.  
</P>
<P>
 In her second visit, rather than grill her, Zellner tried to listen without 
judgment. Potter obviously felt grief over her estrangement from her daughter, 
so Zellner talked about Burrows' children. That drew a response. Zellner could 
tell Potter now was welcoming her visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter began retreating from her testimony on the third visit. When Zellner 
started saying it was clear Joe Burrows and Ralph Frye hadn't been at Dulin's 
house, Potter nodded. Will you put that in writing? Zellner asked. Yes, Potter 
answered, she would. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter wasn't yet revealing what did happen. This was only a first step, 
Zellner knew. Judges disdained recantations generally, and they'd particularly 
abhor one from Gayle Potter.  
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, Zellner began assembling what she truly needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In December of 1993, Zellner's associate, who was combing through boxes of 
files handed over by the state's attorney's office, came across a curious 
letter Potter had written soon after her arrest, addressed to a friend named 
Tom Williamson, who lived two miles from Bill Dulin's home. In it, Potter 
pleaded for Williamson to "come forward" and say he'd seen a "light blue Chevy" 
pickup truck parked outside Dulin's home, because otherwise "the police are 
going to try to say I was the one who killed Mr. Dulin.... Tom, PLEASE, I'm 
begging you." This was critical evidence, for it suggested Potter's early 
intent to deceive. But Tony Brasel had never shared it with the defense. This 
looked to Zellner to be a clear violation of the discovery rules -- and reason 
alone for a new trial.  
</P>
<P>
 The next month brought even more reason. In early January, a former girlfriend 
of Chuck Gullion, feeling troubled, had called the Champaign County police to 
say that Gullion, repeatedly over the years, had told her Burrows was innocent. 
This call, in turn, had led Iroquois County investigators to re-interview Gayle 
Potter's old boyfriend Steve Gillespie. In a taped interview on Jan. 14, 
Gillespie had added a significant detail to his earlier statements. When a 
bloodied Gayle returned to her cousin's apartment on the night of Dulin's 
murder, he now revealed, she'd said "she had some trouble with Bill.... She 
said that he hit her and she killed him." He hadn't told this to the 
investigators before "because I didn't want to get involved."  
</P>
<P>
 Gullion and Gillespie, kept from the witness stand because Brasel had denied 
them immunity, finally were speaking out. 
</P>
<P>
 Zellner now turned to Potter with heightened zeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Their meetings stretched on for months, more than 20 in all between April of 
1993 and 1994. Most lasted more than an hour. Potter talked often about 
Brasel's "double cross," and often about her troubled childhood. In turn, 
Zellner described Joe Burrows' suffering, how he sat confined in a nine-by-six 
cell 22 hours a day, how he couldn't touch his family when they visited, how 
his children were tormented in school. 
</P>
<P>
 The connection grew, week by week. Potter began to sense empathy, even 
sympathy, in Zellner. This was no ruse; Zellner believed she understood Potter, 
understood her pain.  
</P>
<P>
 It was happening again, Zellner realized. She was bonding with a sociopath, 
just as she'd done with the serial killer Larry Eyler. Sociopaths, and their 
mask of sanity, mesmerized Zellner. They appeared normal, but had no 
conscience, no moral core, no regard for the consequences of their actions. 
They were aberrations of nature, like the unusual rocks Zellner's geologist 
father used to show her. Studying Potter recalled for Zellner the thrill she 
felt as a kid when she looked at snakes at the zoo. She could see the snakes, 
but they were separated from her; they couldn't get her, couldn't bite her. 
What excited Zellner most was the challenge of beating these sociopaths. She 
wanted to get them.  
</P>
<P>
 Time pressed on her now, though. At the Menard Correctional Center, Joe 
Burrows was unraveling. His had been a troubled life well before the arrest for 
Dulin's murder. Over the years, he'd rarely managed to stay out of one jail or 
another for very long. The gap between one release and the next arrest often 
was a matter of months, leaving scant time with his three children, who all 
were under 3 when he went to prison in March, 1985, on a burglary charge. 
Released in January, 1988, he and his family had struggled -- there was a 
sojourn in a homeless facility in Urbana, times Burrows slapped his wife 
around, the day police picked up Burrows after a screaming fight with Sherri 
and her brother. For a while that summer the family separated, Sherri and the 
kids going to live with her mom. By the fall they'd reunited, but then came the 
arrest for Dulin's murder. After the Illinois Supreme Court upheld Burrows' 
murder conviction, Sherri had stopped visiting him for four months, until she 
realized she just couldn't walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in early 1994, Burrows started giving up. He'd always thought this all 
was going to be seen as a mistake, but when he was found guilty and sentenced 
to die, he'd shut his brain down. In the journal he'd started keeping, Burrows 
last January wrote: "I have been dead for so long now I doubt if I know how to 
live any longer.... Today I made the decision to put an end to all the pain and 
suffering the only way I can. I will write the court and waive all my rights 
and petition the court to proceed with my execution as soon as possible. I just 
pray to God that I have the strength to see it through." 
</P>
<P>
 We have to bring this to a close, Zellner realized when she learned of 
Burrows' despair. We need a resolution.  
</P>
<P>
 Visiting Potter one morning soon after, Zellner laid out the whole intricate 
story as she saw it. There was something fishy in the Iroquois jail, she told 
Potter. Burrows and Frye were not there at the murder scene. There was no blue 
pickup, no money clip, no wallets, no pants. The cops fed Frye, Brasel coached 
Potter, Potter and Brasel coerced Frye. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening, Potter admired Zellner. The lawyer had it right almost to every 
detail. All except who actually killed Dulin.  
</P>
<P>
 That question Zellner went after days later. On the morning of April 1, she 
drove to Dwight intending to get a confession.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think a woman committed the murder," Zellner began, sitting before Potter 
in the conference room they'd shared regularly now for more than a year. 
Zellner spoke slowly, carefully. "This was a small, frail, 88-year-old-man, 
5'5" at most," she said. "A big man like Joe Burrows wouldn't have had to 
struggle with him. There wouldn't have been any broken fingernails or 
ricocheting bullets. It wouldn't have happened." Zellner eyed Potter, who is 
five feet tall. "The killer was about the same height and strength as Dulin," 
Zellner said. "The killer was a woman."  
</P>
<P>
 It was so obvious, Potter marveled.  
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Potter told Zellner, "a woman did do it."  
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, Gayle, I'm not passing judgment."  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ever kid yourself that it matters at all what you think of me."  
</P>
<P>
 It did matter, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter trusted Zellner. This lawyer had always been honest with her, had never 
tried to twist her around. She'd always made it clear she was representing 
Burrows and not helping her. Potter thought Zellner good at her job. In the 
Iroquois County Jail, she'd always had a support system to help keep this story 
going. Here, Zellner just was not going for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're right," Potter said. "A woman did do it. I was there alone. I shot 
Bill Dulin." 
</P>
<P>
 She wouldn't yet say she purposefully squeezed the trigger; "the gun went off" 
is how she put it. There was, all the same, a buried hint of pride in her tone. 
The enormity of it all, the daring of it all, fed Potter's self-image. They 
didn't want to think a woman could do this, Potter would later proclaim. But 
she ran with the big boys, so she was expected to act like the big boys.  
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, Potter called Zellner. She wanted another meeting; she 
wanted to put her story on the record. On Wednesday, April 6, accompanied by a 
court reporter, Zellner arrived to tape Gayle Potter's confession. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening as she talked, Zellner considered this woman's motives. Yes, Potter 
hated Tony Brasel and wanted to get him. Yes, Potter knew that the rules 
against double jeopardy, and the statute of limitation against perjury, 
probably protected her from new prosecution. But Potter also knew she was 
kissing off any chance she might have had for a governor's clemency or release 
through a federal habeas petition. In truth, since her conviction was based on 
her own perjury, the state might still be able to retry Potter. Clearly, 
Potter's confession now was against her own interests. Clearly, there was room 
for Zellner to run with this confession. 
</P>
<P>
 All she had to do was convince Judge Michela that he, and his esteemed legal 
system, had made a horrible mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the hearing on Burrows' request for a new trial began July 26 -- 
in the Kankakee courtroom where he'd been tried, convicted and condemned -- 
there had been, if not a retreat, a certain adjustment made by some of those 
who'd put him on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't my job to believe that Joe Burrows committed this crime," Brasel 
had told the Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette. "But based upon the evidence, it 
was always my understanding that he did."  
</P>
<P>
 Robert George "could have" stopped the tape during Frye's interrogation, 
Sheriff Mathy had been quoted as saying. "In fact, my investigator is not going 
to get up and say it didn't happen.... I wish I'd been there that night." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such comments, Kathleen Zellner's petition and mounting news media 
attention, Judge Michela had concluded there was a lot about this case he 
didn't know. He was determined to remedy that situation. From the start, he 
overruled most of the lawyers' objections to testimony, and intervened to ask 
his own questions of witnesses. Plainly, he wanted to hear everything. 
Truth-seeking, not legal process, was now paramount in Michela's court. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, various figures from the 5-year-old murder case appeared and 
settled into the witness stand. First came Gayle Potter, confessing, describing 
her exchanges with Tony Brasel, explaining that she let Burrows go to Death Row 
"because I was afraid I was going to be walking in his shoes." Next came Ralph 
Frye, recanting, describing how Investigator George "shook his head" and "shut 
the tape recorder off" and "said there was five shots." Then Jana West swore 
she'd been with Burrows the night of Dulin's murder, Ron Boyer described Ralph 
Frye's first jailhouse recantation, Mathy defended his men's actions, George 
insisted he hadn't fed Frye, and Brasel denied everything. Finally, Joe Burrows 
testified -- for the first time ever.  
</P>
<P>
 None of these witnesses mattered as much to Judge Michela, however, as did 
Iroquois County Detective Sgt. Randy Eimen. 
</P>
<P>
 Eimen took the stand late on the first of the hearing's four days. Yes, he 
said in response to a question, it was Gayle Potter who'd first mentioned the 
blue pickup truck, on the day they arrested her. And yes -- he had mentioned 
that blue pickup truck to Ralph Frye when they questioned him early the next 
morning. Frye first had denied any involvement, Eimen testified, then had 
started saying he'd driven up to Watseka with Joe and Sherri Burrows in their 
car. Eimen had stopped him; Eimen had said, "Ralph, Gayle said you came in a 
truck." Soon after, Eimen had left the room, and George alone had taken Frye's 
tape-recorded statement. 
</P>
<P>
 This testimony inspired Judge Michela to ask Eimen some questions.  
</P>
<P>
 Michela: When you talked to Ralph Frye and Ralph told you that he and Joe 
Burrows and Sherri Burrows had gone to Watseka in, I assume, Mr. Burrows' car, 
you elected not to believe that? 
</P>
<P>
 Eimen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Michela: You elected to believe Gayle Potter and the blue pickup?  
</P>
<P>
 Eimen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Michela: Once you found out that you couldn't find the blue pickup, that you 
could not connect Joe Burrows to a blue pickup ... did you ever follow up to 
see if, in fact, Mrs. Burrows and Mr. Burrows and Mr. Frye had gone to Watseka 
in his car?  
</P>
<P>
 Eimen: No, I don't believe so. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a seemingly innocuous moment. But Eimen's testimony -- eventually 
confirmed by George -- was, to Michela, the critical key to the entire hearing, 
and to Burrows' fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Eimen's disclosure, the judge would explain later, "absolutely shocked me." 
Burrows' guilt, to Michela, had always hinged on Frye, on the fact that what 
Frye said pretty well followed Potter's story. Now Eimen on the stand was 
saying Frye had first talked about going up to Watseka with Joe and his wife in 
a car -- a whole new aspect of what might have occurred. Now Eimen was saying 
the police had stopped that story to give Frye the blue pickup, and that only 
then had Frye said, OK, it was a blue pickup. Now Eimen -- most incredibly of 
all -- was saying that even after they'd found out there was no blue pickup, 
they'd still stuck with Potter's story and hadn't tried to investigate other 
possibilities.  
</P>
<P>
 "At that moment," Michela recalled later, "I decided this (Nov. 9 tape 
recording) was not Ralph Frye's statement, or partly not."  
</P>
<P>
 That the police had been the link between Potter's and Frye's initial 
statements, of course, had been both a defense theme and a matter of apparent 
common sense from the start. There are those who find it shocking that the 
judge was so shocked. To Michela, however, neither a defense lawyer's argument 
nor common sense transformed theory into fact. While on the bench, he felt 
utterly obliged to separate what he believed from what the facts were. Eimen 
was the key for him because with Eimen's testimony, what was once merely a 
likely theory -- even common sense -- was now provable. 
</P>
<P>
 Michela decided he wanted to listen again, in his chambers, to the actual tape 
of Frye talking to George, which had been played at Burrows' second trial. From 
what he heard, he couldn't conclude that the recorder had been turned off four 
or five times, as Zellner claimed, but it was clear that long gaps existed 
between the questions by George and the answers by Frye. What's more, the 
questions were more like statements requiring Frye to concur. It occurred to 
Michela now just how different this initial statement of Frye's was from his 
later testimony. Here on this tape, Frye exonerated himself from involvement in 
the murder, saying he was merely present. In his later testimony, he is an 
accomplice, Burrows a killer, Potter a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd been a little naive about what was going on in Iroquois County, Michela 
realized. If he'd understood, he would have sentenced Frye right after his 
trial and gotten him away from Potter.  
</P>
<P>
 The similarity of their testimony no longer looked to Michela like proof of 
Burrows' guilt. The similarity now looked like proof that Potter had coerced 
Frye to conform his story to hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Zellner cried as she struggled to write her closing argument at 4 
o'clock on the morning she was to deliver it. If she failed here, Zellner 
thought, she'd stop being a lawyer. It would be too hard to go back into a 
courtroom, to feel the same about her profession and the legal system. She'd 
always thought people who were convicted were guilty; now she'd seen enough to 
know that wasn't so. The insight frightened and disturbed her. 
</P>
<P>
 "You, Your Honor, have the power to give Mr. Burrows back his life," Zellner 
told Michela later that morning. "I am asking Your Honor to exercise that 
power.... You are the one who heard the evidence in all three trials, and 
you've heard the evidence in the last week. Words cannot and will not ever 
convey the magnitude of the injustice that occurred in this courtroom.... When 
this is all over, I want to be able to sit down with Mr. Burrows' three 
children and ... say something horrible happened to your father, but it is 
finally over. Evil people like Gayle Potter do not win. Lies do not win. I want 
to tell them that the truth has won." 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks later, on the morning of Sept. 2, the first page of the judge's 
decision started rolling out of the fax machine in Zellner's office. Then, 
because of a transmission problem, it stopped. The judge's office tried a 
second fax machine, but it didn't work either. At the Menard Correctional 
Center, Joe Burrows sat waiting on an open line linked to Zellner's office; the 
other convicts had donated all their phone time to him. Zellner could tell 
nothing from the one page that had come through. She dialed the judge's private 
number. "I'm sorry, judge," she said. "This may not be proper, but I've got to 
know. What did you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Michela couldn't believe Zellner was nervous. She'd acted so sure of herself 
in court. Didn't she know what he'd do? Potter's letter to Williamson and Jana 
West's testimony alone were enough. "Why, I gave him a new trial," the judge 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1972, 50 prisoners had been freed from Death Rows across the country 
after their convictions were reversed or thrown out, but Illinois had never 
freed a condemned convict because someone else recanted or confessed. Yet that 
singular action was precisely the one Zellner asked Michela to take when she 
and Burrows appeared before him at a Sept. 8 bond hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the testimony of its two eyewitnesses the state had no case against 
Burrows at all, she pointed out, so Burrows couldn't possibly be retried. 
Zellner wanted bail set for Burrows. What's more, because he was indigent, she 
wanted him released on his own recognizance.  
</P>
<P>
 Michela may have had little choice but to honor Zellner's request. Still, it 
is not the custom of trial judges to release the prisoners they've condemned to 
Death Row. Trial judges leave that, if it's to happen at all, to appellate 
judges sitting hundreds or thousands of miles away -- judges looking at 
lifetime tenure and piles of papers, rather than at an agitated community and a 
grieving family and a looming reelection campaign. Michela knew he could pass 
this thorny Burrows matter to the Illinois Supreme Court. But he was friends 
with five of the seven justices; in 1992 they'd upheld Burrows' conviction and 
sentence -- always a source of pride for a trial judge. It was not fair or 
right to ask them now to overturn themselves. He had presided at three trials 
and this last hearing; he had sentenced Burrows to death. He would set him 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 As a guard, following his instructions, moved forward to unlock the prisoner's 
shackles, the judge spoke to the man he'd once condemned. "I would suggest, Mr. 
Burrows," Michela advised, "that you be very careful."  
</P>
<P>
 Later, amid all the tumult and hoopla ignited by the image of a just unchained 
man walking free down the Kankakee County Courthouse steps, the judge would try 
to point out that "all I said was, there's enough for a new trial. I didn't say 
Burrows was not guilty." The heart of the matter, though, was not lost on 
Michela's colleagues. On the night he let Burrows go, Michela dropped by a bar 
where several other judges were watching a local news broadcast. Just as he 
entered, an image of Burrows exulting at a press conference filled the bar's 
television screen. "There he is," one of the judges joked, pointing at Michela. 
"There's the judge who set a killer loose." 
</P>
<P>
 All that remains unfinished now in Iroquois County is the fixing of 
responsibility for how Joe Burrows came to spend five years on Death Row.  
</P>
<P>
 The answer most commonly offered puts the blame chiefly on Gayle Potter. With 
a few exceptions, that is how the news media and the talk shows have portrayed 
the matter. That also, generally, is how Judge Michela has portrayed it.  
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling granting Burrows a new trial, Michela agreed with all but two of 
Zellner's six claims. He rejected the one charging Tony Brasel (and through 
him, the sheriff's office) with prosecutorial misconduct. He also rejected the 
one charging Ron Boyer, Burrows' first defense attorney, with ineffective 
assistance of counsel. Responsibility for what happened to Joe Burrows, Michela 
suggested, rested in places other than the legal system or its custodians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Potter is a case study of what can happen when one deceives, continues to 
deceive and is believed by the investigating authority," the judge wrote. "The 
evidence presented at this hearing does not warrant the conclusion that 
prosecutorial misconduct occurred. The court does not believe Potter on this 
point. She is a vicious liar who brings this charge out of vindictiveness. She 
did not need any assistance from either Mathy or Brasel to create a scenario in 
which she is the hero and Burrows and Frye the perpetrators." As for Frye's 
testimony about the prosecutor and investigators, "the court is compelled to 
conclude that, at this point, Frye does not know what he knows, what Eimen and 
George told him or what Potter led him to say."  
</P>
<P>
 It was not necessary to destroy Boyer and Mathy and Brasel, Michela believed. 
He didn't have to go that far. What he wanted to do was deliver justice, free 
Burrows. That he had done. If he said Mathy did this, Brasel did that, where 
would he get it from? He wasn't going to get it from Potter or Frye. Nothing 
was provable.  
</P>
<P>
 This conclusion, it goes without saying, does not suffice for everyone, 
particularly for some of those most intimate with what has happened in Iroquois 
County.  
</P>
<P>
 "Michela absolved all the lawyers, all the people he still has to work with," 
Gayle Potter observed one fall morning, sitting in the same conference room at 
the Dwight Correctional Center where she spent so many hours with Kathleen 
Zellner. "There's a lot more going on than what the judge wants to admit. 
That's not to lessen my blame, but I couldn't have done it alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Burrows agrees. "When someone is on the inside, they know how they can 
twist things," he said as he sat in the kitchen of his home in Homer, Ill., 
fielding a flood of congratulatory phone calls. "The judge blames Gayle and 
exonerates the system. But see, it takes two. Gayle can't manipulate the system 
unless someone on the inside is willing to go with her. Gayle is an evil 
person, but Gayle was just trying to protect her ass. And Ralph is real 
gullible. I hold no grudge against them. My grudge is against those inside the 
system. They're supposed to be above people like Gayle." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, particularly lawyers, tend instead to blame the court-appointed 
attorneys who defended Burrows and Frye. Yes, they say, these attorneys have 
limited resources, yes they are paid a quarter of the going rate for private 
attorneys. Still, there should have been more investigation and challenges. 
Above all, there should have been motions to suppress Frye's initial Nov. 9 
statement. Why didn't they call their clients' alibi witnesses? Why didn't Ron 
Boyer withdraw as Burrows' attorney so he could testify about his encounters 
with Frye? In an ideal adversary system, the defense attorney is supposed to 
fight as hard as the prosecutor. That's where the system broke down. That's why 
this happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few, in all this animated discussion, think to point a finger of blame 
at Judge Michela. Only a few think to ask just what the role of a judge is in 
achieving justice, or whether the steward of the legal system shirks his duty 
by ceding his judgment to a jury's. Among those few who do raise such 
questions, as it happens, is Judge Michela.  
</P>
<P>
 He questions himself and plays devil's advocate endlessly. He wishes he had 
kept Frye away from Potter and the Iroquois County Jail. He wishes he'd removed 
Ron Boyer as Burrows' attorney and allowed him to testify. He debates with his 
wife, who asks, "Why can't you guys admit you make mistakes?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, Michela flatly rejects the suggestion that he is 
responsible for what happened to Joe Burrows. "The jury chose to believe the 
testimony of Potter and Frye, which led to death-qualifying conviction of 
(Burrows)," he wrote in his ruling. "Based on that evidence, the death penalty 
was warranted and no apology is due from the sentencing judge." 
</P>
<P>
 God knows, we love the good king, Michela likes to say. But we fear the bad 
king. As God told Israel, if you want a king, you must take everything that 
comes with it.  
</P>
<P>
 "The power we hand judges to overrule or direct verdicts is awesome, just 
colossal," Michela said one November afternoon, weeks after the initial tumult 
over Burrows' release had subsided. "It's so easy to abuse it, so easy to 
advance your personal views. Sure, I could have intervened. But would you give 
me the power to direct a guilty verdict as well? You know when I'm a good 
judge? When I agree with you. Sometimes a Burrows will happen. I feel badly; 
I'm not an unkind or unfeeling person. But this is the price we pay for the 
democracy of the jury system. It wasn't Mathy or Brasel who convicted Burrows, 
it was a jury. We went through the system, we followed the process." 
</P>
<P>
 And that venerable process, Michela points out, continues to this day. 
Everyone, he observes with satisfaction, still is playing their prescribed 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illinois attorney general's office prepares to appeal Michela's ruling, 
claiming the judge "went against the wishes of the jury." Kathleen Zellner 
readies both a cross-appeal, seeking affirmation of her prosecutorial 
misconduct claim, and a civil suit against Iroquois County and Tony Brasel. 
Frye's appellate attorney plans to petition Michela for his client's release. 
The Iroquois County state's attorney considers filing new murder charges 
against Gayle Potter. Soon, once again, lawyers will argue, witnesses will 
testify, judges will listen, juries will rule. There is responsibility yet to 
be fixed, penalties yet to be paid.  
</P>
<P>
 "Act I was the crime and the investigation," Michela says. "Act II was what I 
did. Act III is still to come."

A BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS; LOCKE'S PARKER, CRENSHAW'S SMITH AND GARRETT TAKE TOP 
CITY TIMES HONORS

<P>
 In 1993, running back Sirr Parker of Locke High was disappointed to only make 
the City Times' Prep Football All-Star second team. 
</P>
<P>
 Locke Coach E.C. Robinson said he had never had a player more deserving of 
first-team honors than Parker. "He is the nicest kid and one of the most 
talented players I've ever coached," he said. "You have to see this kid." 
</P>
<P>
 But Parker turned disappointment into inspiration, working harder during the 
summer break, lifting weights and running. 
</P>
<P>
 The work paid off, because Parker not only earned his spot on the 1994 City 
Times' All-Star first team, he also received one of the ceremonies' biggest 
honors: Back of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, a 5-foot-10, 185-pound senior who gained 1,129 yards and scored 16 
touchdowns rushing, received the award at the City Times' awards brunch Sunday 
at the Holiday Inn Crown Plaza near USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, I thought I deserved to make first team," Parker said. "This 
season, I not only made first team, but I won most valuable player. It was a 
great addition." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw defensive end Kabeer Smith was selected Lineman of the Year. Robert 
Garrett, who guided Crenshaw to a 12-2 overall record and to the City Section 
4-A division finals, was named the Coach of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised to win the award because my team didn't do very well this 
season," Parker said. "When I got the award, I was wondering what the crowd was 
thinking. Did I really deserve this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Parker doubted he would win the award because his team finished with a 
disappointing 0-10 record, including forfeits of two victories. College 
football coaches, however, noticed Parker's winning attitude and have made him 
one of the area's most recruited athletes. He is considering Division I 
scholarships from Notre Dame, Washington, Washington State, Oregon, Texas, 
Colorado, Arizona, Texas A&M, Florida State, USC and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not leaning toward any school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 6-4, 205-pound senior who led the Cougars with 92 tackles, 18 sacks 
and five fumble recoveries, is just beginning to gain recognition.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to sell recruiters on Smith since last spring," Garrett said about 
Smith, who also scored three touchdowns as a tight end. "Now they are coming 
out of the woodwork all within the last two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Division I schools showing interest in Smith include Cal, UCLA, 
Washington, Fresno State, Colorado State, San Diego State, Hawaii, New Mexico, 
Oregon, and San Jose State." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith uses mathematical and statistical principals when trying to evade a 
blocking lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He studies football through math," Garrett said. "He will draw angles and 
intercepts trying to figure out the best way to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's biggest play of the season came in the City semifinals when he 
followed a Dorsey offensive tackle across the line of scrimmage. Smith tackled 
Jemell Gordon for a three-yard loss when the Dorsey running back had the 
opportunity to break away for a long touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was in front of Gordon," Garrett said. "(Dorsey Coach) Paul Knox told 
Kabeer if he hadn't made that tackle, Dorsey would have gone to the 
championship game and not Crenshaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Several coaches turned in outstanding performance worthy of coach of the year 
honors. Bell's Henry Santiago led the Eagles to the City 3-A title in his first 
season as coach. South Gate's Gary Cordray won the Southeastern Conference with 
a perfect 8-0 record. Loyola Coach Steve Grady took the Cubs to the playoffs 
again. Dorsey reached the City 4-A semifinals under Coach Paul Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garrett did the unthinkable, going undefeated in the Southern Pacific 
Conference with a 7-0 record. He took the Cougars to the 4-A championship game, 
where they were humbled, 38-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaching is not about winning awards," Garrett said. "Coaching is about 
making better citizens out of young people. It's about molding and steering 
young student-athletes in the right direction." 
</P>

 "If I got married, I would want Coach Garrett to be my best man," Crenshaw 
running back Farrel Payton said. "He's very strong and loving and kind. He's a 
big motivator." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Crenshaw running back Brandon Seals: "To me, he's my best friend. He 
cares about you as a football player, but also about your academics. He makes 
us strive to be better."

NOTEBOOK; CITY SECTION GETS ADDED BERTHS IN STATE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Crenshaw High boys' basketball team, the two-time defending State Division 
I champion, has won an unequaled six State titles. City Section boys' 
basketball teams have won eight championships since 1981 and been in the final 
nine times during that span. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet since 1992, only the City 4-A champions have been guaranteed berths in the 
Southern California Regional Division I playoffs for boys and girls. The 
Southern Section, by comparison, receives four automatic berths each for boys 
and girls in the eight-team brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 That scenario will change beginning with this year's State tournament, when 
the City will receive two berths each for boys and girls in the regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The request from the City section was reviewed by the State CIF basketball 
advisory committee in January and approved by a four-member panel of Southern 
California commissioners. To make room for the added berths, the at-large berth 
that had come from the Southern, San Diego, Central or City sections has been 
eliminated. The San Diego and Central sections will remain at one automatic 
entry each. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mathematically, it didn't make sense the way it was written before with the 
number of schools we had and how successful the City has been at the State 
level," City Athletic Commissioner Barbara Fiege said. The Southern Section 
fields 91 schools in the Division I classification of 1,500 students or more. 
The City section has 43 Division I schools.  
</P>
<P>
 The decision brings the City's representation back to the level it enjoyed 
before 1992, when the state cut the City's automatic berths to one each for 
boys and girls. Before 1992, the City 3-A and 4-A boys' and girls' champions 
received berths in the regional playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said only 4-A teams will be considered for the two berths -- the 
champion and either the runner-up or a semifinalist -- pending a final decision 
to be made next month by the City basketball seeding committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said the current City policy is to wait until league play ends before 
classifying teams 4-A or 3-A, using quality of play as the criterion, 
regardless of a school's enrollment or record. So, Fiege said, only the best of 
the City schools will be 4-A once the playoffs begin. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dorsey High Coach Kevin Gibson, whose Dons have advanced to the 4-A final 
the past three years, the change was long overdue.  
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I didn't think it was right for us not to go" to the State 
tournament, Gibson said. "The City has been dominant up north over all these 
years. I didn't see why we got slighted for one of the positions." 
</P>

TREASURES; FOR THE HOMELESS, A FEW SECIAL EFFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gregg Segal , Gregg Segal's last photo essay for the magazine was on L.A. 
public pools. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you were allowed to keep only those items that would fit in one suitcase, 
what would you choose? For the homeless, that is a critical question. Just what 
keepsakes -- if any -- are tucked away in that Vons sack or under that 
garbage-bag canopy? Last spring, I decided to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 With my camera, I sought out the homeless along the Los Angeles River, by the 
Alameda Street railroad tracks, at L.A. freeway overpasses and shelters, on New 
York City streets, and I asked them what possessions they valued most. Their 
answers suggested past identities and entanglements that would have been 
impossible to guess: a cross, family photos, a bell, a toy car, underwear, 
lipstick, a figurine of the Virgin Mary, a college diploma, a dog, a doll. 
</P>
<P>
 But if our identities are shaped by what we possess, what happens to those who 
have nothing? The homeless who kept no links to a former life affected me most, 
because they had done away with sentiment: The need to survive had worn it 
down. "You can't keep nothin' of value out here on the streets," said one man, 
pushing an empty cart, "because you won't have it for long." 
</P>
<P>
 Another man with a sign that read "Deaf Mute With AIDS -- Please Help" flagged 
me down in a McDonald's when he saw my camera. Pointing at himself, he raised 
an eyebrow as if to ask, "You want my picture?" I wrote a note on a scrap of 
paper, asking if he had anything in his duffel bag I could photograph. He 
indicated that it would cost me $3. I nodded and he began pulling clothes out 
of his bag. I tried to explain that I was looking for something he treasured, 
but he just pulled out more faded, balled-up clothes. I gave him $1. He shoved 
two fingers at me, his eyes at once menacing and pitiful. Still, I declined to 
take the picture. I turned to go and he spoke: "What do you want from me?" 
Everyone looked at him. He didn't care that he'd given up his deaf charade; he 
had nothing to lose. I gave him two bucks. He didn't move, didn't say a word.

THE MAN WHO WOULDN'T GO OUT; FOR 20 YEARS, GERARD BRACH HAS OCCUPIED A WORLD 
SCARCELY LARGER THAN HIS ROOM -- THE PROLIFIC CENTER OF A SCREENRITER'S 
UNIVERSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Laurence B. Chollet, Laurence B. Chollet lives in New York. His last piece 
for the magazine was a profile of cyberspace writer William Gibson. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an air of mystery about screenwriter Gerard Brach, and it makes just 
getting to see him something of an event. He doesn't do power lunches, take 
meetings, or give interviews, as a rule. In fact, if you don't know someone in 
his inner circle -- directors Jean-Jacques Annaud, Claude Berri, Roman Polanski 
-- forget it. You'll never find him. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery deepens when Brach opens the door to his Paris apartment and 
greets you with a cautious smile. He's about five feet four, spry. Dressed 
casually in a blue LaCoste sweater, purple sport shirt and dark blue slacks, he 
looks more like a prosperous businessman from Cleveland than the elusive legend 
of French film that he is. 
</P>
<P>
 He's friendly and polite in an old fashioned way: He shakes your hand and bows 
slightly. Then, just when you feel at ease, you catch his eyes. They are dark 
and honest and flood you with a torrent of conflicting emotions -- fear, humor, 
pain, happiness, flashes of terror, laughter, grief, a curious optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 It's disconcerting, but then he cheerfully sits down at his desk in a shaft of 
sunlight, offers you a chair and starts explaining the toys on his desk: a tray 
of small, neon-colored spinning tops; toy birds the size of baseballs that 
warble when you lift them up; kaleidoscopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fantastic for exciting my imagination, you know?" Brach, 67, says in his 
heavily accented English. "Because it's true, I never go out of my flat. I 
stayed here, inside for seven years; I don't even go to the elevator during 
that time. . . . So these help me travel visually." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of staying inside for seven years may sound strange, but not in 
Brach's case. He's an agoraphobic, a person who suffers from a fear of open 
spaces. And his dread of such everyday events as a walk in the sun or lunch 
with friends has been so intense that it has kept him in bed for weeks at a 
time and indoors for most of the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The illness descended on Brach like a black cloud out of nowhere in the early 
1980s, and it has been known to make him break out in a cold sweat, shake and 
freeze in panic as soon as he steps outside.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first time this came over me, I felt like I had suddenly come down with 
this strange disease, only I don't know what it is," Brach says. "I am standing 
on a Paris street corner when suddenly -- foo! I cannot move, I cannot cross 
the street, I cannot do nothing. For one half hour I do not move." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely sensitive to perspective, that is my problem, a big part of my 
problem," he adds. "It just seems to take me, you know, sweep me away. One day 
years ago, I go to the Eiffel Tower, walking underneath it. I look up and I 
have this awful sensation of vertigo -- only in reverse. I felt like I was 
being sucked up! Is strange, no?" 
</P>
<P>
 His illness may have kept him inside, but it did not keep him from becoming 
one of the most remarkable screenwriters of our time. His first feature, "River 
of Diamonds," came out in 1962, and since then 27 others have made it to the 
screen, establishing his international reputation for non-verbal storytelling, 
brilliant images and extraordinary range -- from thrillers like "Cul-de-Sac," 
one of his favorites, to lyrical adaptations of literary classics like "Jean de 
Florette."  
</P>
<P>
 He's perhaps best known as Roman Polanski's screenwriter -- or, as Brach likes 
to quip, "Roman's idiot." They've been as close as brothers (and as different 
as night and day) for nearly 34 years. They have also collaborated on 10 films 
-- including "Repulsion," "The Tenant," "Tess" and "Bitter Moon." They have 
just finished their 11th, a version of "Cinderella." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, a Who's Who of European cinema -- Michelangelo Antonioni, 
Bertrand Blier, Ridley Scott, Roland Joffe -- has beaten a path to Brach's 
door.  
</P>
<P>
 Brach's biggest success, however, has been with Annaud, 51. Berri introduced 
them in 1977 and they have collaborated on four offbeat films: "Quest for 
Fire," a drama about prehistoric man; "The Name of the Rose," a mystery set in 
the Middle Ages, based on Umberto Eco's bestseller; "The Bear," the story of a 
bear cub's emotional development, told from the cub's point of view, and "The 
Lover," based on Marguerite Duras' story of a young French girl's coming of age 
in 1920s Indochina.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of these films has grossed more than $100 million worldwide, and they are 
not big-budget action pictures a la Spielberg's or Stallone's, but small, 
intimate dramas that are short on dialogue, long on visuals and connected by 
what Annaud calls "our silk red ribbon": the quest for humanity in a world that 
has lost all sense of what being human is. Right now, they are finishing a 
fifth project: an untitled epic set among Eskimos and whalers in 19th-Century 
Greenland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get very moved when I think the films I have done with Jean-Jacques have 
been the most successful for me," Brach says. "Emotions I write here, in this 
room, take place in dark screening rooms and theaters in America, Argentina, 
South America, China. It's a mysterious connection of human feelings . . . I 
wish I could know all the people who see my movies." 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the real achievement of the Brach-Annaud collaboration, it helps 
to know about " la guerre ," the war. That's what Annaud calls the 10-year 
battle he's waged (along with Brach's wife, Elizabeth) to get the man everyone 
calls Gee-rard outside. It hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped trying to change him long ago," says his old friend Polanski. "It's 
simply not worth it. We end up arguing and I say, 'Look, Gerard, what is the 
problem?"  
</P>
<P>
 But Annaud was different. He understood the enemy well. He suffered from 
agoraphobia himself in his 20s. He knew the terror, dread, and humiliation it 
brings. And that understanding helped him wage a savvy guerrilla campaign of 
quick lunches and occasional trips that eventually culminated in a 
now-legendary event in French film circles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was shooting 'The Bear' in the Dolomites," Annaud recalls. "I was doing the 
scene where the big bear was confronting the hunter. It was a very, very 
difficult scene. Then suddenly the walkie-talkie on my belt goes off and it's 
my assistant calling, 'Urgent! Urgent!' And I said, 'What is it?' And he said, 
'Someone in Paris has seen Gerard in the street taking a taxi!' And I said, 
'No, that is not possible.' And my assistant said, 'Yes, we guarantee it. It 
was Gerard. With a suitcase. Someone saw him and just called us. It's that 
spectacular!" 
</P>
<P>
 That memorable cab ride in the summer of 1987 marked the first time that Brach 
had stepped outside his Paris apartment alone in nearly seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has continued to improve. On good days, he eats lunch at a beautiful 
little restaurant about 100 yards from his apartment. And he cannot thank 
Annaud enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jean-Jacques has been very, very compassionate with me, he understands me 
perfectly," Brach says. 'With many people this is impossible. They will say to 
me, 'What's with you? You look well. Why don't you go outside? You're joking, 
right?' "It is the situation of every man who is sick," Brach says. "People who 
are well cannot bear those who are sick because the sick cut the beautiful 
ambience of -- I don't how to say it. It is like putting a crippled hand in a 
black leather glove on the table at a fine restaurant during dinner. It reminds 
people of their frailty. 
</P>
<P>
 "But not Jean-Jacques," Brach adds. "He doesn't judge me because I do not go 
out. He never judged me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brach (pronounced Brahsh ) may be a reluctant interviewee -- this is his first 
ever for an American publication -- but once he gets going, he's hard to stop. 
He speaks initially in French, translated by Annaud and Elizabeth. But as the 
interview rolls over several days, he becomes more at ease, and shifts into 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a born storyteller, and thanks to the cable television, the man who 
rarely leaves his Sixth Arrondissement apartment is an informed citizen of the 
world -- and a master channel surfer. He's also a huge fan of American 
football, even though he's still not sure of all the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting for me, watching television in English," Brach says, his 
eyes taking on the twinkling glow they get when he becomes intrigued. "I 
understand maybe half the sentences -- and I love not understanding everything. 
Because for me, it is like a mystery, you know. I feel like I am an explorer. I 
like these strange situations. They are very interesting to me." 
</P>
<P>
 His office is standard writer's fare: a long monastery table (order and abbey 
unknown) dominates the room, facing a giant black television. Art books are 
everywhere: open and piled on his desk, stacked on the floor, spilling from two 
corner book shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you realize this is the living room -- or would be, but it's been 
converted into his office. The same is true with the dining room, now 
Elizabeth's office, complete with computer, copy machine and fax. The entire 
apartment is immaculate, even pretty, with hardwood floors and quaint little 
balconies overlooking the street. But it seems customized to do one thing: turn 
out scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the only challenge each day is the challenge to fill a blank sheet of 
paper," Brach says matter-of-factly. "It's a fight between the will of an 
action and the power of laziness. . . . And day after day, I wonder which one 
will win." 
</P>
<P>
 Brach doesn't consider screenwriting so much writing as a kind of poetry: 
creating a series of images, like stones across a pond, that lead the audience 
to a very specific, emotional place. His most successful films often linger as 
a single, haunting image, such as Yves Montand as Cesar Soubeyran at the end of 
"Manon of the Springs" learning from a blind old woman at twilight that he has 
inadvertently destroyed his own family.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't understand his writing," Annaud says. "They look at 
something like 'Quest for Fire' and say 'How can there be a screenplay for that 
movie! There was no dialogue!' So what ? When you read the screenplay, it reads 
like something you see. That's the key. When you read something Gerard writes, 
you see ." 
</P>
<P>
 Brach talks frankly about his agoraphobia, often in a dark, wry humor that 
puts his many quirks in an upbeat light. At times, his adventures, as described 
by him and his friends, take on the surreal quality of a tale told by a Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez -- particularly his dealings with Annaud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember days when he would only go from his bed to the desk and back 
again, he was so frightened," Annaud says. "When we were doing 'The Name of The 
Rose,' he would just stay in his bedroom, in bed, wearing a stocking cap with a 
pom-pom on it. He would have on these gloves and dark glasses and he would just 
be there, in bed writing." 
</P>
<P>
 "The strange story of Gerard Brach," Brach cackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is only very recently that he's accepted to have one of those," Annaud 
says, pointing to a channel changer on Brach's desk. "Because he invented le 
baton de la television . Where is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brach rummages around and eventually produces a long broom handle with a 
plastic claw attached at one end. "I am the inventor of le baton de la 
television ," Brach says, proudly displaying the contraption. 
</P>
<P>
 "For five years, I could not convince him to get a channel changer," Annaud 
says. "We'd be working, and every two seconds he was pushing the television 
set, changing channels with that thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not! It is mine!" Brach says defensively. "I've heard that the Greeks or 
the people in Egypt claim to have invented it. But they did not -- I did!" 
</P>
<P>
 Brach's main connection with the outside world is his striking wife, 
Elizabeth, a tall, lanky Laplander. She was born and raised in Finland, then 
came to Paris in the 1960s to study art. She met Brach in 1969 at the Cafe de 
Flore, the legendary Left Bank hangout, and they've been together ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a combination wife, agent, secretary, typist, investment banker, cook 
and translator. She speaks five languages. And over the years, they've become a 
finely tuned production team. He's up and writing each day at 8, filling up 
blank sheets of white paper with his neat printing. He stops around 1 and turns 
the work over to Elizabeth. She types it up, and it's ready for Brach when he 
sits down to work the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question the relationship has been challenging. They were married 
in 1980 in Gerard's bedroom. But the inconveniences pale compared to the 
admiration Elizabeth holds for her husband and his work. "The thing about 
Gerard is, he is very easy with everyone -- the poor, the rich, it makes no 
difference to him," Elizabeth adds. "I remember once, we went out to a party 
full of extreme left-wing Communists. They were drinking wine in plastic 
bottles, eating off plastic plates, in this terrible apartment. That same 
night, we went to a party thrown by some corporate guy who ran a big shoe 
company. He lived on Avenue Foch. Everybody was wearing diamonds, and when we 
arrived they gave us champagne and caviar. We stayed a half hour at each party. 
For Gerard, it was absolutely no difference, no difference at all. For him, we 
are all suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brach has never sought professional treatment for his agoraphobia, but he 
suspects the illness is rooted in the traumas of his early life. He was born in 
Brittany and grew up in extreme poverty in Paris. By 18, he had contracted 
tuberculosis and landed in a sanitarium as a charity case. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent nearly five years there, undergoing brutal operations that eventually 
left him with just one lung. The mental agony was equally intense; antibiotics 
were not readily available, and death was a regular event. "It was just after 
the war, and there was a very strange collection of people at this place," 
Brach recalls. "Communists, anti-Communists, members of the Resistance, 
deportees. We even had some people coming in from the concentration camps -- 
some Jews, some not. It was a fantastic school of pain." 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1950s, Brach had recovered and was working as a runner for Pierre 
Roustang, who would become a legendary producer of New Wave films. Brach did 
everything from movie publicity to bit acting, appearing as a studio 
photographer in "Breathless," the 1959 cult classic made by his friend Jean-Luc 
Godard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brach was so poor at times he often slept in production offices. Sometimes 
he would let himself be locked in the offices so he would have a place to stay 
for the weekend. To kill his hunger until the offices reopened Monday morning, 
he ate baguettes laced with vinegar. To kill his loneliness, he randomly dialed 
phone numbers, talking with anyone who picked up. A brutal divorce in 1955 had 
not helped: His first wife left him and their son, Eric. All this made Brach a 
memorable character when he met Polanski in 1961 in Paris, when the two began 
writing together. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always scared of something -- flying, driving, walking, swimming, the 
street, heights," Polanski says. "I remember we were doing this story about a 
man who sold the Eiffel Tower, and I told Gerard we had to at least see the 
thing if we were going to write about it. So we went over there, got up to the 
first level -- just the first level -- and Gerard is shaking! So I said, 'Let's 
go up.' And he just said, 'No, no, no !' He was gripping the railing so hard 
his knuckles were white. It was incredible. No matter how much I badgered him, 
insulted him, screamed at him, he would not budge." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Brach's quirks, he and Polanski were inseparable during the 1960s -- 
they lived in London, hung out in Gstaad and in Cannes. Polanski's fast-lane 
lifestyle had little effect on Brach's increasingly fretful nature: He never 
learned to drive, swim or ski and had absolutely no desire to visit America 
because he's afraid to fly. Wherever Brach and Polanski went, Brach would often 
set up shop in a bedroom, in bed, writing. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they finished "The Tenant" -- the macabre story of a man who moves 
into a small Paris apartment and is driven insane by the specter of its former 
occupant -- Brach had vanished inside. He and Elizabeth were living in a studio 
apartment just off the Champs-Elysees.  
</P>
<P>
 He only felt safe in bed, so that's where he stayed. His head got cold, so he 
wore a stocking cap. His eyes, ever sensitive to light, would act up, so he 
donned dark, goggle-like sunglasses. His hands got cold, so he wore black 
leather gloves; then they'd get hot, so he'd wear mittens filled with ice 
cubes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most of five years, Gerard worked in bed on this little lap table," 
Elizabeth says. "The entire apartment was so small -- 20 meters square! You 
couldn't set up table to dine on! So when someone would come to work with 
Gerard, then stay for lunch, we would have to clear off Gerard's little lap 
table and eat on that. I can still see Ridley Scott hunched over that table, 
eating soup, talking with Gerard." 
</P>
<P>
 While Brach was moving away from the world, Annaud was busy traveling around 
it. He was born outside Paris and picked up a love of film at the local cinema 
during Sunday matinees, and by 19 he was directing commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 By 28, he was one of Europe's best directors, with several hundred commercials 
under his belt, a pile of prizes, a farm in the Loiret, and a reputation for 
never being at the last phone number he gave you. He was also completely 
miserable. He felt that he'd sold out. The prospect of making "poetry out of 
yogurt," he says, precipitated a personal crisis. He, too, wound up trapped 
inside his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the same disease as Gerard," Annaud says. "I hated myself. I put on 20 
pounds of fat around my hips and did not want to go outside. I grew a beard and 
refused to go out any more. My first wife eventually left me. Only then did I 
start going out again." 
</P>
<P>
 Annaud's salvation turned out to be film -- and a love of faraway places, 
inspired by his military stint in Cameroon, Africa. He combined both passions 
in his first feature film, "Black and White in Color," a farce about French and 
German colonialists in Africa during World War I. It won the 1976 Oscar for 
best foreign film.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first day we met with Jean-Jacques was in my studio apartment," Brach 
recalls. "This was during the time I was not coming out at all. I was sitting 
in my bed, he was sitting on the floor, and it was evidently clear we 
immediately understood each other. Both of us got the same impression: that we 
could work together. And very quickly we discovered that we were fascinated by 
prehistory, and we knew a lot about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "On that same day we met," Brach adds, "we decided to write a script from 
(J.H. Rosny's) book 'Quest for Fire.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Brach turned out a brilliant 100-page screenplay that had no dialogue but read 
like a book full of prehistoric pictures. But no sooner did Annaud start 
filming than one producer after another began backing out, each one 
misinterpreting the film's theme. The end came on location in Canada when the 
ninth or 10th producer (Annaud isn't sure) refused to let him shoot the crucial 
scenes: those dealing with the invention of fire. Annaud quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so much in the middle of a nightmare," Annaud said. "I called Gerard to 
tell him it was all over, and he went absolutely crazy on me, saying I couldn't 
quit, we had worked too hard on this. And finally he said, 'Don't be stupid! 
It's near the end. This is what you have worked for!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Annaud found yet another producer and finished the film. "I was so down at the 
time, I know if Gerard had said 'Quit' I would have. Instead, I went on. And I 
think it's fair to say, had I not done this movie, my career would be very, 
very different." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial by "Fire" helped the two men forge a deep friendship. Annaud would 
be flying in a helicopter, scouting locations in Greenland or British Columbia, 
and would call Brach in his Paris apartment just to tell him about the terrain. 
Brach returned the favor by filling in Annaud on what he was seeing on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 As their friendship bloomed, so, too, did their filmmaking. Brach's fertile 
imagination gave rise to poetic images that Annaud not only understood but also 
had the technical ability to translate into film. Together, they found the 
courage to make films they had only dreamed of before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jean-Jacques would say, 'What do you think, maybe we do a movie about the 
mythology of ancient Greece?' And I would be stunned -- I would say, 'Is 
possible?' And he would say, 'Yes, of course it is. Anything is possible.' He 
allowed me to make films with images that had filled my imagination since my 
youth, images of adventures, dreams, open spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 About this time, Annaud began working to get Brach out. His first objective 
was small -- dinner at a quaint restaurant 100 yards from Brach's apartment. It 
took more than three months (three months, 17 days and one night, according to 
Brach) of constant cajoling and numerous broken dates before Annaud succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 But no sooner did Annaud, his wife, Laurence, Brach and Elizabeth sit down to 
dinner than a fight broke out, the only restaurant fight Annaud has ever seen. 
The event terrified everyone, except Brach. He was fascinated by the commotion 
and figured it was just part of going out. They finished dinner, and he 
promptly returned home -- to stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Annaud spent months persuading Brach to spend a weekend in the 
Loiret, at Annaud's country place, 90 minutes outside Paris. Brach finally 
agreed, and it turned out to be an expedition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would only travel with a small ice chest filled with ice cubes, an 
old-fashioned atomizer full of cologne water, a bottle of camphor," Annaud 
says. "And a fan! He had this little Chinese fan he was always using then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to drive very, very slow, or else he became very nervous," Annaud says. 
"When we finally arrived at my place, he grabbed Elizabeth by the arm and said, 
'Look! So many leaves!' I will never forget that line -- it had been so long 
since he had seen so many trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one room in my house that was tiny and dark, and that's where he stayed 
for all three days,' Annaud adds. 'He came out twice -- to go on a little boat 
in a nearby river and to swing in the back yard. He liked the swing." 
</P>
<P>
 This trip was just the first skirmish in la guerre, but it culminated in 
Brach's now legendary solo cab ride in the summer of 1987. The question, of 
course, is, where did he go? On a trip? To the zoo? To see a friend? Wherever 
it was, Brach isn't saying. He prefers to let the image speak for itself: him, 
with suitcase, in a cab, in Paris, traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gerard has many, many secrets," Annaud says with a sly smile. "And some even 
I do not know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's just after 1:30, and Brach is outside, on the street, leading Annaud, 
Elizabeth, and a few friends to lunch. He walks stiffly, like a man who's been 
aboard ship on a long ocean voyage, but he's clearly in a good mood. He's 
whistling "We Are the World." He looks smart in a dark-blue, smock-like jacket 
and could pass for an average Parisian -- until a large sidewalk grate comes 
up. He hesitates for a second, discreetly steadies himself on a friend's arm 
and keeps walking. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is small and quaint, reminiscent of a French country cottage, 
and Brach is greeted like a visiting dignitary. Waitresses take his coat and 
lead him to his favorite spot, a corner table. He sits in the corner seat, just 
under a large mirror, a gift from Brach to the restaurant owner, a longtime 
friend. A small postcard of "The Lover" is wedged in one corner of the frame.  
</P>
<P>
 During the next few hours, Brach seems right at home. It's only after awhile 
that you notice he tends to behave like a man atop a high ladder: He doesn't 
look around much, just focuses on what's right in front of him. But that 
doesn't dampen his current obsession: CNN anchor Bobbie Battista. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Bobbie Battista!" he says with a glee in his eyes that seems to add a 
permanent exclamation mark to the end of her name. "I am fascinated by her like 
the bird by the snake. Who is the snake, who is the bird? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 "You interview people in cinema," Elizabeth says, "and most say, 'Ah, I am 
fascinated with Elizabeth Taylor, or Catherine Deneuve.' But not Gerard. He's 
fascinated by Bobbie Battista! And most people here don't even know who she 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 On the way home, Brach seems a bit tired. He's walking more slowly, holding 
onto Elizabeth's arm. Then Annaud abruptly darts across the street to point out 
a favorite bookshop. Brach freezes for a second, looks both ways like a 
groundhog coming out of his hole, and scoots across the street. He makes it 
with ease.  
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, everyone is exchanging goodbys in front of Brach's 
apartment building when he suddenly walks down to the corner, looks up at the 
sun, and waves. 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles, and for no reason at all, starts to laugh in the sunshine, a big 
full laugh that shakes his small, stocky frame. He then shrugs, says goodby to 
everyone, and heads back inside to work, whistling -- leaving only the strains 
of "We Are the World" behind.

 If the ghosts of movies past roam studio back lots -- and it's hard to visit 
such places and not believe they do -- then the recently refurbished Sony 
Pictures Studios in Culver City is where they're likely to feel most at home. 
At a cost of roughly $100 million, only a fraction of the $2.7-billion losses 
the company wrote off last month, the former home of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has 
been renovated in a manner befitting both the grandeur of the site's history 
and the ambition of its present owners. 
</P>
<P>
 This was hardly happenstance, according to Peter Guber, the former chairman 
and chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment who conceived the 
project. "A major entertainment company benefits greatly from having a creative 
center of gravity," he said. "But we didn't want it to be only 
state-of-the-art; we wanted it to be state-of-the-heart. The historical 
significance of this lot had to be preserved and advanced." 
</P>
<P>
 MGM, founded in 1916 and once the most glamorous of studios, was first sold in 
1985 and passed through four more or less indifferent owners -- "Not even a 
coat of paint had been put on since that sale," Guber said. Enter Sony in 1990. 
The company, which owns TriStar and Columbia, repainted everything, from a dull 
tan to a cool gray, restored the elaborate ironwork of the original gates on 
Washington Boulevard and the charming vintage buildings on the lot's 
once-prestigious A Street. Then, under the supervision of Kenneth Williams, 
senior vice president of corporate operations, it went further. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that the lot's most architecturally interesting structures, 
including the 1936 Irving Thalberg Building, were in the Art Deco style, Guber 
and Williams made this the redesign's leitmotif. Existing Deco touches on sound 
stages were highlighted and a 1 1/4-mile-long perimeter wall with Deco 
flourishes was built. 
</P>
<P>
 They also used the Deco style to improve the look of many boxlike buildings. A 
terrazzo and stainless-steel lobby and a gaudy but graceful orange and pink 
neon sign now announce the Cary Grant Theatre, and the studio commissary has 
been turned into the ocean-liner-elegant Rita Hayworth Dining Room, complete 
with George Hurrell photographs of the Columbia actress. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most obvious changes are the false fronts on a series of drab, 
windowless buildings once relegated to storage and now used as offices. The 
result is a playful Main Street, with fanciful signage for stores such as The 
Sporting Age (with costumes and pictures from Columbia's "A League of Their 
Own") around a town square dominated by the Frank Capra Bank clock. It all 
looks real enough to function as a working back lot, and, in fact, was used as 
such TriStar's recent "Cops and Robbersons." 
</P>
<P>
 Typifying the nostalgic spirit of the remodel is the proliferation of 
enormous, hand-painted copies of old movie posters. Though the most visible 
ones are placed on 40-foot-high turrets at the lot's two entrances ("Lawrence 
of Arabia" and "Lost Horizon" at Columbia, "Terminator 2" and "The Natural" at 
TriStar), the most impressive is near The Grill restaurant: a huge reproduction 
of a German poster for Columbia's 1935 Peter Lorre feature "Crime and 
Punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 A great deal has been done as well to the technical interiors on the lot, and 
Sony is especially proud of its new high-definition video facility and the 
Imageworks special-effects unit. But ghosts probably don't care that much about 
new machines, and just this once, it might be nice to let them have their way.

 As if with the sweep of a magic wand, the Walt Disney Co.'s Animation Building 
has materialized in Burbank. In case you missed it, it's the 
orange-and-red-striped structure arcing skyward next to the Ventura Freeway and 
emblazoned with the word ANIMATION. Like a big exclamation point, an 
85-foot-tall Sorcerer's Apprentice hat marks this world of fantasy. But it's 
more than just another studio addition. Designed by New York architect Robert 
A.M. Stern, it's a giant sign inhabited by the Disney division that started it 
all and produced some of the company's recent blockbusters, including the 
animated features "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the beauty of the sign has tamed the beast known as the office building. 
Behind a facade that unspools like a strip of film out of a projector (the 
celluloid theme also guides visitors along a pathway from the front door to the 
main atrium) stretch acres of vaulted, stucco-covered space where more than 600 
animation employees work their movie magic. Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, who 
worked closely with Stern, a Disney board member, is pleased with how the 
building gives economic necessity a fantastic shape: "This is a cheap building, 
not because we're cheap but because we believe in putting the money on the 
screen, where you can see it," he says of the $54-million project. "My theory 
has always been that backstage should be a dump, so our instruction to Bob was 
to make it look like his offices in New York."  
</P>
<P>
 Taking Eisner's wry directions in the spirit in which they were intended, 
Stern created generous spaces filled with light and order. Walk through the 
marquee-like entrance under the conical hat (Vice Chairman Roy Disney's 
vertiginous office), and you find yourself in a canting atrium space that soars 
the equivalent of five stories to the top of the billboard-like arc. Beyond 
this grand gesture -- which turns out to be filled with ventilation equipment 
-- a stripped-down aesthetic takes over, complete with exposed ducts and blank 
walls where animators can hang their storyboards. Topping off these bare bones 
is a ceiling of black insulation tacked up with silver-capped brads. Though the 
ceiling was supposed to be painted white, Stern decided the sheets of 
insulation evoked "a starry night" that made the whole workaday interior look 
more like a movie set. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought of it as a little city here, complete with streets, intersections 
and buildings on major squares," Stern explains. The "buildings" are small 
meeting spaces where Eisner says "creative people rub shoulders." The spaces 
are identified with streamlined graphics that mirror those in the 1940s-era 
Disney lot across the street. Soft colors temper what Stern calls the "culture 
of creative clutter," while Mickey stamps his round-eared silhouette on 
everything, including the reception desk, tables, chairs and lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was inspired by the Disney cartoons of the 1930s and '40s," Stern says. 
"They drew cities of the future in the background, and so we built that place." 
Now the animators occupy the fantasy environment they helped inspire, and 
Stern, a postmodern sorcerer, has satisfied his clients, from the rank and file 
(now united under one roof) to the chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "This building proves that you can make good things without being crazy," says 
Eisner as he surveys the newest part of his Magic Kingdom. "Look, even the 
freeway looks aesthetic from here."

 Even for Californians -- and especially for gardening Californians -- there 
comes a time in the dead of winter when we long for a blast of color: something 
fiery hot to warm a garden's chilly bones. Just as naked trees rattle overhead, 
the Mexican marigold ( Tagetes lemmonii ) springs to life, splashing the 
landscape with the spirit of spring.Tough, aromatic, drought-resistant, it 
grows in shaggy heaps up to several feet tall, with orange blooms that double 
as cut flowers and feathery, citrus-scented leaves throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ruth Borun's West Los Angeles garden, this feisty showoff proves just the 
thing to liven up a barren wall. Underplanted with alyssum, blue fescue and 
euphorbia, it adds what Borun calls "a wild look in a civilized framework" 
while demanding little in the way of care. Garden designer Christine Rosmini 
installed the marigold for Borun, who loves its off-season exuberance and 
explosive form. "I get so tired of neat, neat, neat," she says. "A little chaos 
is exciting."

THE CUTTING EDGE: SPECIAL REPORT; O.C. SOFTWARE FIRM FINDS A QUICK, ON-LINE 
SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When a client's software glitch in Cuxhaven, Germany, threatened to delay 
shipping along the Elbe River near Hamburg last spring, programmers at 
Wonderware Corp.'s Orange County headquarters immediately began looking for a 
fix late that same evening, Hamburg time. 
</P>
<P>
 The programmers examined copies of the software code that a company engineer 
in Cuxhaven downloaded to them in Irvine via Compuserve, one of a half-dozen 
on-line services that allow computer users to exchange electronic mail and 
review data. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubled program was used to convert analog radar signals into digital 
form so they could be read by a computer that monitored ship traffic. Several 
hours later, the faulty program was corrected and returned to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Wonderware began using the on-line service in September, 1993, such a 
repair would have taken days of shipping disks across the Atlantic by express 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can answer questions from Germany or Japan about 10 minutes after you get 
them," said Rashesh Mody, a Wonderware manager for technical support. Before it 
began using Compuserve, he said, "we sometimes sent faxes back and forth, but 
you can't keep track of all the information in that form." 
</P>
<P>
 For software companies that have come to depend on such on-line services to 
distribute and update their products, choosing among providers like Compuserve, 
Prodigy Services Co. and America Online Inc. has become as important as 
choosing among competing long-distance telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies are tied more directly to the Internet to respond to customers' 
inquiries and stay in touch with far-flung sales representatives. The Internet 
is a worldwide computing standard that links more than 3 million computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Orange County software companies, Wonderware has a foot in each camp 
-- a subscription to an on-line service as well as a customized Internet 
address registered in the company's own name. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Forster, a Wonderware project manager, said the company's presence on the 
Internet and on Compuserve has been beneficial. "We had two factions arguing 
which was the better way to go, so we decided to do both," he said. Much of the 
company's software repairs and updates are shipped through its Compuserve 
account, while the company's Internet address -- which is maintained through 
another provider -- Netcom On-line Communication Services Inc. in San Francisco 
-- is available to greater numbers of Wonderware's customers. 
</P>
<P>
 With an added on-line dependence, Forster and other on-line managers are 
considering a possible market shake-up in 1995, driven by the introduction of a 
new service by software giant Microsoft Corp., based in Redmond, Wash. The 
Microsoft Network will allow PC users to go on-line directly through its 
popular Windows program, which is installed on nearly 60 million computers and 
is seen as serious competition for the established service providers like 
Compuserve, Prodigy and America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the attention Microsoft has received since announcing its service at 
Comdex, the giant trade show in Las Vegas last month, local business users say 
they don't expect the network will drastically affect their own operations. The 
competition among service providers, they say, will rest on which can provide 
more access to the Internet itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's network "is another service we'll definitely have to look at," 
said Bruce Quigley, director of sales and marketing at Smith Micro Software 
Inc. in Aliso Viejo. "I'd have to see it in use before I can say whether we'd 
want to be on it or not. It has to do with what our customer base wants too." 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held company, with about 75 employees, already has two employees 
to handle technical support inquiries on its Compuserve account, he said, and 
is considering setting up additional support service through America Online and 
Apple Computer's electronic service. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft isn't discussing specifics of its service, though trade journals 
suggest the network initially will only allow users to send and receive e-mail 
via the 'net and to participate in discussion groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't have good Internet access, they're toast," said Mark Jenkins, 
an editor at Interactive Week, a trade journal in Garden City, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the leading service providers today charge fees based on the time 
users are connected, Microsoft may base its fees on how much information users 
download or how much mail they transmit, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other areas of the United States, interest in the Internet is increasing 
exponentially in Orange County as measured by the number of companies that have 
registered a name on the network through the Internet Network Information 
Center, a project funded by the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 714 telephone area code, 218 new commercial names were registered this 
year through Nov. 15, compared with just 81 names for all of 1993, according to 
Michael J. Walsh, president of Internet Info, a market research firm in Falls 
Church, Va., that analyzes the registrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like taking a snapshot of the United States and saying, 'These 
are the high-tech centers,' " Walsh said. "It's got nothing to do with the 
geography; it's got everything to do with the high-techishness of the regions." 
</P>
<P>
 For every name registered, there can be dozens or more actual users. The 
largest cluster of Internet users in Orange County is connected through UC 
Irvine. David Walker, assistant director of the UCI office of academic 
computing, estimates about half of the school's 16,000 students and as many as 
two-thirds of its 5,000 faculty and staff have individual accounts. Because all 
those accounts have the same ending designation -- "uci.edu." -- they would be 
counted just once by most surveys of users, making it difficult to calculate 
exact demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 Because businesses on the network tend to be smaller, however, the number of 
names ending in "com," the designation for commercial or business users, makes 
the InterNIC count a helpful measure of business use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It correlates to the fact that the most commercial stuff is being done in 
California," said Allen Weiner, principal analyst for on-line strategies at 
Dataquest Inc., a San Jose-based market research firm. "A lot of them are just 
homesteading, staking a claim, putting up their fence post . . . but they're 
hoping that somebody who's surfing (the Internet) is going to find them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no cost to register a name, some analysts suggest that the 
rush of new registrations is partially a defensive move by companies to prevent 
others from capturing their brand name. Two of the best-known cases involved 
individuals who registered "coke.com" and "mtv.com" to themselves. In another 
case, a competitor to the Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Center registered 
"kaplan.com" as its own name. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line managers in Orange County say they don't know of local instances of 
trade names being poached. Of the commercial addresses registered to companies 
or individuals in Orange County, the majority belong to computer hardware or 
software companies, such as AST Research Inc. in Irvine ("ast.com"), Filenet 
Corp. ("filenet.com") in Costa Mesa and Ingram Micro Inc. ("ingram.com") in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 One local address that is not registered to a computer company is 
"medicaldata.com," acquired last May by Medical Data International Inc. of 
Irvine, an information consulting company that works with medical equipment 
manufacturers and health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Hicks, an information technology manager there, said 25 to 50 messages 
are transmitted each day between the company's 41 on-site employees, five 
off-site consultants and researchers, and its customers and readers. About half 
of its message traffic is between its 46 employees, the other half between 
employees and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The medical industry is pretty unsavvy about computers in general," he said. 
He said he's not surprised it's mostly software firms that have most addresses 
now, but that may change as biomedical companies and other industries set up 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said his company plans to make more services available to customers 
early next year, which would allow customers to view catalogues or navigate 
public databases. 
</P>
<P>
 Another user looking to increase its services on the network is Zyxel Corp., 
an Anaheim modem manufacturer that uses its Internet connection to answer user 
questions and to offer free upgrades of its software. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Mosbrook, a Zyxel engineer, said reduced mailing costs and faster 
response for customers are the main benefits of having an on-line presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to have to set aside time to call us, they want the 
convenience of being able to post a question, then come back and look at the 
response a day later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosbrook and others must balance that convenience against the security issues 
of opening their computers to the prowlers who could be drawn to an Internet 
address. The company is hoping to install an on-line ordering system as soon as 
protocols for protecting information transmitted on the Internet are developed, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just credit card numbers; I want the whole order to be 
secure," Mosbrook said. "I don't want anybody sniffing in there to see that 
(Internet) traffic."  
</P>
<P>
 Only the gradual adoption of privacy measures for the Internet is likely to 
change the minds of Internet skeptics, said Donald Douglas Jolley, a networking 
consultant in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're dealing with communications between two companies on a bulletin 
board-style system like Compuserve, you don't have the problems of your message 
traffic lying around on several different computers," Jolley said. "If you're 
strictly talking about communicating company to company, that's an advantage to 
using a service provider in preference to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Internet's advantage is that it's a common denominator, so you'll be able 
to hear from anybody who wants to send you mail . . . and I'm not sure that the 
smaller businesses, other than the software houses, are ready for what the 
Internet has to offer, beyond e-mail."

 More than 50 area codes have in excess of 100 commercial Internet addresses -- 
called domains -- registered with InterNic, Internet's administrative center. 
Here's how Orange County stacks up against other local area codes as of Nov. 
15: 
</P>
<P>

San Bernardino, Riverside (909): 56 Top Internet States 
</P>
<P>
 More than two-thirds of the 25,000 are in ten states. California is home to 
more than one-quarter of them. Top 10 states with Internet commercial domains 
(with percent of total): 
</P>
<P>
 California: 5,287 (28.7%) Colorado: 1,260 (6.8)% Massachusetts: 1,227 (6.6)%

</P>
<P>
 The increase in the number of commercial addresses has skyrocketed throughout 
Southern California over the past three years. Even for 909, a code that did 
not exist until 1991, there has been extensive growth: 05,11,06,06,06,06 Area

CANADIAN COLONIAL FIRM RELIES ON ITS TRADING POST TRADITIONS FOR GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small Canadian company present at the birth of the nation has been brought 
back to life and is flourishing by looking to its roots, including fur-trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Although North West Co. Inc. was founded in 1779, it spent most of the past 
200 years as a division of its onetime rival, Hudson's Bay Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1987, a group of employees and investors bought the division, 
repatriated the North West Co. name, and started to take the reborn company 
forward by looking backward. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the sale was Canada's first fur-trading post at Waskaganish, on 
the shores of James Bay in Quebec. The trading post had been founded in 1668 by 
Hudson's Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done extremely well by focusing on their traditional markets," said 
Marie-Josee Privyk, an analyst with Marleau Lemire Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, North West now owns and operates 153 stores in 
Canada, 26 in Alaska and eight fur marketing branches -- stores that buy and 
sell furs from trappers. 
</P>
<P>
 They stretch across Alaska, the Northwest Territories, the northern prairie 
provinces and Quebec into Labrador and Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of ourselves as a northern retailer," said Gary Eggerston, North 
West's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 When North West was founded, its business plan involved setting up a trading 
post 200 miles inland to intercept trappers on their way to an outpost of 
archrival Hudson's Bay Co., Eggerston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So when North West put in a store, the Bay put in another one, and they 
leapfrogged each other farther and farther into the Canadian West," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many Canadian communities grew up around these outposts. The intense rivalry 
continued for 40 years until 1821, when the two enemies -- claiming equal 
numbers of trading posts -- called a truce and formed a partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 North West continued happily as Hudson's Bay's fur division until 1987, when 
Hudson's Bay decided to sell its fur auction houses and its northern stores 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, North West decided to sell some of its more "southern" stores to 
focus on its smaller, more remote outlets. It now owns all of Hudson's Bay's 
ancient trading posts, including Waskaganish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our earnings have continued to increase," Eggerston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings should improve as the benefits from recent renovations to older 
stores filter through the company and offset the costs of an expansion into 
Alaska, Privyk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggerston said the unusual nature of North West's business leads to an odd 
combination of goods in its stores. Guns, snowmobiles, wedding dresses and 
video rentals are available in outlets averaging about 6,000 square feet in 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell musical instruments, rifles for hunting, things required for people 
who live off the land," Eggerston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the only store in town, North West also cashes checks and occasionally 
sells fast food through franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 North West also acts as North America's largest distributor of Inuit -- or 
Eskimo -- art, buying carvings from local artists and distributing them to 
galleries around the world from an office in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 While the company's earnings have improved since it sold the southern stores, 
its share price outlook is less rosy. "The whole merchandising sector is out of 
favor now," Privyk said. "If 1996 figures are strong, that might turn the 
stock." 
</P>
<P>
 North West's share price is languishing at $11.875 in Canadian currency ($8.79 
U.S.) after trading as high as $20 Canadian ($14.80 U.S.) on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange last summer.

CHALLENGERS TAKING ON LONDON EXCHANGE; STOCK MARKET: THE NEW SYSTEM WANTS TO 
CATER TO HIGHER RISK, GROWTH COMPANIES IN EUROPE. IT COULD BE UP AND RUNNING BY 
NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four new stock exchange systems are poised to slice into an investment pie 
that has been, up until now, controlled by the London Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The European Assn. of Securities Dealers (EASD) is the latest group to 
announce its intention to launch an automated screen-based trading system 
Easdaq, or EASD Automated Quotation, offering investors an alternative to the 
London Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Easdaq will cater to higher risk, growth companies throughout Europe, and 
could be up and running by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Easdaq market would be a European parallel to the computer-based Nasdaq 
system in the United States that boasts many rapidly growing high-technology 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Share Information Ltd., a Cambridge, England-based company, intends 
to launch an automated screen-based "enterprise exchange" for small-capitalized 
British companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Share is in discussions with Britain's Securities and Investment 
Board, and hopes to start a pilot run in the first quarter of 1995 with a full 
launch by June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Electronic Share and EASD decisions to challenge the London Stock 
Exchange's dominant position in its own market comes on the heels of the demise 
of the Unlisted Securities Market, scheduled to close in 1996 due to a European 
Union directive. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Share claims entrepreneurial companies may find it difficult to 
attract investors after the Unlisted Securities Market folds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a smaller, high-risk company, where will you go to find capital?" 
said Jack Lang, Electronic Share's director. 
</P>
<P>
 The London Stock Exchange claims smaller companies and investors need look no 
further than a new Alternative Investment Market, designed to fill the gap left 
by the Unlisted Securities Market. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange published a consultative document for the new market at the 
beginning of September and hopes to have the Alternative market running by June 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 While fighting a rear-guard action to stave off competition in the small-firms 
sector, the London Stock Exchange must also lock horns with Tradepoint, which 
will offer dealing services to institutional clients in the largest capitalized 
stocks, the Financial Times index of 100 stocks, or FTSE 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradepoint expects to have regulatory approval in the next few months but is 
not quoting a specific start-up timetable. "It's all in the hands of the SIB 
(Securities and Investment Board) but we don't anticipate any problems," said 
Peter Bennett, Tradepoint's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said Tradepoint's automated screen-based system would be open for 
business about two months after receiving the regulatory go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Liberty, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Eurobond settlements group, 
Cedel, which launched a dealing service in U.S. equities last month, is 
expected to offer international investors a trading facility in British stocks, 
perhaps by the end of 1995, which will bypass the London Stock Exchange's SEAQ, 
or Stock Exchange Automated Quotations System used to trade large blocks of 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty says its users can enter an order on its screen-based dealing system 
from anywhere in the world, verify its accuracy, and receive an execution and 
confirmation on their screen or printer in less than 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The London Stock Exchange said it is prepared to meet the challenge of any and 
all newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not complacent but not overly worried about the competition from other 
trading services. There is no evidence that there is a demand for order-driven 
systems," a London Stock Exchange spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said, the London Stock Exchange's new "Sequence" trading and 
information system will incorporate software that will allow screen-based 
automated trading if the market decides the current market-making system is no 
longer desirable.

THEY'RE BIRDS OF A FEATHER -- EXCEPT IN BUSINESS; POULTRY: THE MANAGEMENT 
STYLES OF FRANK PERDUE AND HIS SON DIFFER VASTLY. BUT UNDER JIM PERDUE, THE 
CHICKEN PROCESSOR HAS BECOME EVEN BIGGER UNDER A NEW MANAGEMENT STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA HUMPHREY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Perdue and his famous father, Frank, both have a passion for the chicken 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 But the men, and their missions, are very different. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Perdue was a workaholic who built Perdue Farms Inc. into the nation's 
fourth-largest poultry processing concern. His son, James A. Perdue, is a 
soft-spoken man who is taking the family-owned business into the next century 
with a proposed merger, state-of-the-art processing plants and a focus on 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Perdue, the youngest of four children and the only son, puts in 12-hour 
days but still has enough time left to coach his children's soccer teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a strong work ethic at Perdue, but I think it's important for people 
to have balance in their lives," said Perdue, 44. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, in building the business, he put in the hours. I seldom saw him as a 
child growing up. He could spend 18 hours a day at the plant and get by on 
three or four hours' sleep. He had a cot in his office, even though he only 
lived 50 yards away." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know the two agree that Jim and Frank are men of distinct 
personalities who have used their special skills in doing what's best for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly Frank was and still is the entrepreneur and Jim still has the 
entrepreneurial spirit. But he also has the education and the temperament and 
the understanding that the company needs to move into a different type of 
management now," said Bill Roenigk, senior vice president of the National 
Broiler Council, the trade association for poultry processors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more complex now in terms of the issues you deal with in the 
marketplace. Jim seems to have an understanding of that," Roenigk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Perdue, 74, is chairman of the company's executive committee and still 
has a say in company affairs. But Jim Perdue, who became chairman of the 
company in 1991, is very much in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Perdue is negotiating a merger with Showell Farms, the 10th-largest 
poultry processor, also headquartered on Maryland's Eastern Shore. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming years, he foresees expansion in retail markets in the Midwest -- 
most of Perdue's business is currently in the East -- and in exports to 
Southeast Asia. He wants the company to expand its turkey business and 
food-services division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growth for us has to be market driven. We don't want to be the biggest 
poultry business. We want to be the best. That drives our growth plan," Perdue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue credits his father for making a lot of single-handed decisions and 
expanding the company. But with the transition from Frank to Jim came a change 
in management style, largely because Perdue Farms was no longer an 
entrepreneurial concern, but a major corporation with 13,800 employees in 10 
processing plants in six states and $1.3 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a bigger operation now. It's a matter of using a lot more teamwork in 
running the business. That's a concept a lot of corporations use. It's a sign 
of the times," Perdue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue said he respects and welcomes his father's advice, and there's a 
healthy tension between the two as they continue to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue chuckled as he recalled decisions he has made that grated on his 
father. One was when the younger Perdue decided to scrap the variety of company 
labels for a uniform blue logo that simply reads "Perdue." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simpler and clearer. It represents all the products," Perdue said. 
"(Frank) accepted it. But he let me know he would have gone in a different 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue began laying the groundwork years ago to emerge from his father's 
shadow. After working for the company during summers in high school, he went 
off to Wake Forest University in North Carolina to study not chickens, but 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a bachelor's degree in biology and a master's in marine biology from 
Southeastern Massachusetts University, then went to the University of 
Washington in Seattle for a doctorate in fisheries. Perdue has an interest in 
fish farming, but don't expect to see Perdue fish sticks anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had to leave home to "have some victories of my own." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was applying for and getting research monies and making presentations in 
fisheries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he had to decide whether to pursue a career in academics or return to the 
poultry business. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, he came back to Salisbury to run the family business his grandfather, 
Arthur W. Perdue, founded in 1920, raising chickens to sell the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt ready to come back. Self-confidence is something you gain from those 
victories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue, who is married and has three children of his own, doesn't see his 
father ever getting completely out of the business to which he devoted his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's delegated authority very well for someone who is a strong entrepreneur," 
Jim Perdue said. "The thing that has driven him his whole life is the success 
of the company. It's a tough business and it took a tough man to do it."

 Ask Frank Perdue how he thinks his son is doing and he says: "I couldn't be 
prouder."

U.S. SEEKS TALKS WITH N. KOREA ON COPTER CREW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 U.S. officials moved to meet with North Korean counterparts at the 
demilitarized zone at Panmunjom today to press for the return of two U.S. 
pilots who went down just north of the South Korean border in a helicopter 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials still have no information on the condition or whereabouts of the 
crew members, Army Chief Warrant Officers David Hilemon of Clarksville, Tenn., 
and Bobby Hall of Brooksville, Fla. Nor do they know if the unarmed OH-58 
spotter helicopter was shot down after straying into North Korean territory or 
if it developed mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were pressing for a meeting through the U.N. Military Armistice 
Commission at the 151-mile border between North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety and well-being of our crew members is our biggest concern," said 
Jim Coles, spokesman for the U.N. command in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials began analyzing the region's weather conditions, terrain 
and other factors in an attempt to reconstruct how the helicopter strayed into 
North Korean territory. Although there are clear markers delineating the border 
between North and South Korea, they may be buried by a yard of snow. In 
addition, the terrain is said to be extremely rough and difficult to 
distinguish from mountain to mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has been nearly 17 years since the last U.S. aircraft strayed into 
North Korean territory, "we are looking at what we need to put into our 
standard operating procedures to minimize the potential for this sort of thing 
to happen again," Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea appeared to be taking a measured approach, raising hopes that the 
incident might be resolved quickly through diplomatic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Pyongyang paraded crew members of the captured Pueblo spy ship before 
TV cameras, coercing them into criticizing the U.S. government. But it did not 
appear likely that the regime would take similar measures this time. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials pointed out that neither side had placed its military forces on 
alert in response to the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the incident, North Korea had referred to the U.S. copter as 
an "enemy" aircraft shot down in a "self-defensive measure." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton Administration officials said U.S. Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), 
who is on a congressional visit to Pyongyang, reported that North Korean Vice 
Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju later described the incident as "unfortunate" -- a 
phrase that seemed pointedly mild for such a situation. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no further angry rhetoric or threat of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a senior U.S. official said the Administration is "not 
looking at this so much as a national security crisis" but as a diplomatic 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are focusing primarily on getting the crew back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the relatively low-key treatment of the incident appeared to 
reflect a new relationship between the two governments after the beginning of 
serious U.S.-North Korea negotiations this fall over economic aid and nuclear 
weapons issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In those talks, North Korea has agreed to eventually halt its nuclear weapons 
program. The United States, in return, has pledged to arrange for alternative 
nuclear reactors that would provide fuel oil energy for Pyongyang and to move 
toward normalization of diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The terse statements by Administration officials Saturday followed a flurry of 
telephone conversations among Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry and Sandy Berger, the President's deputy national 
security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 To intensify its diplomatic pressure, the Administration also sought help 
through the North Korean mission to the United Nations in New York, the 
diplomatic back channel that it has used to arrange broader diplomatic talks 
with Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. officials insisted that the United States is not trying to make 
the return of the two pilots a condition for continuation of the normalization 
talks, they pointed out that the use of the "New York channel," as it has 
become known, signaled that Washington regards the situation as extremely 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them returned," Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said 
on CNN. "It's ominous that this incident took place. This should not have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. helicopter was said to have been on a routine training mission over 
the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea when U.S. air bases and 
other planes lost contact with it. 
</P>
<P>
 With unusual candor, Perry confirmed Saturday that the helicopter had "strayed 
into North Korean airspace" and had gone down in Kumgang County, a few miles 
north of the DMZ. The incident occurred at 11:03 a.m. Saturday local time. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Perry said, "We have conflicting reports about the incident 
and will provide more information as soon as we can confirm details." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials disputed suggestions that the helicopter might have been on an 
intelligence-gathering mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department said Richardson, who arrived in Pyongyang on a 
congressional visit just after the helicopter went down, has asked the 
government in Pyongyang to find and release the two U.S. pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also serving as a diplomatic liaison with the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 The two helicopter pilots are members of the 4th Battalion, A Company of the 
Army's 501st Aviation Regiment, based at Camp Page in Chunchon, South Korea. 
The Pentagon said families of the two pilots had been notified that they are 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the low-key mood in Washington, Administration officials said 
privately that they are concerned that the North Koreans have not provided any 
information about the crew's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pyongyang has every incentive to release the pilots quickly, such 
behavior would still represent a turnabout. Over the last 34 years, breaches of 
North Korean airspace have drawn hostile reactions from the Pyongyang 
government, often involving military retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Saturday that it is easy for helicopter pilots to become lost 
while flying near the demilitarized zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe reported from Seoul and Pine reported from Washington.

RUSSIA TAKES HARD LINE ON CHECHNYA; CAUCASUS: KREMLIN WITHDRAWS OFFER FOR PEACE 
SUMMIT WITH BREAKAWAY REPUBLIC, SAYS IT IS PREPARING TO BOMB CAPITAL. MOSCOW 
LAUNCHES ROCKET ATTACK ON VILLAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 The Kremlin withdrew its offer for a peace summit with Russia's tiny breakaway 
republic of Chechnya on Saturday and said it was preparing to bomb the rebel 
capital into submission. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight today, Russian forces launched a rocket attack on the 
village of Pervomaiskoe, 15 miles north of the heavily armed capital of Grozny, 
according to Chechen military sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before dawn today, Russian warplanes again reportedly streaked over 
Grozny but did not strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Dzhokar M. Dudayev, the Chechen leader, sent two urgent messages during 
the evening accepting a 2-day-old Kremlin offer of top-level peace talks. But 
the Security Council said that only leaders of the military operation would 
meet with him and only to discuss disarming his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 In grave tones, Russian authorities made it clear that their hardening 
campaign against a 3-year-old declaration of independence by the oil-rich 
Muslim republic had reached its apex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting at midnight, Interior and Defense Ministry forces will take decisive 
steps, using all means at their disposal to restore order," a Foreign Ministry 
communique said. "Bandit groups will then be disarmed, and those which dare to 
resist will be destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the "decisive steps" planned, said Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai D. 
Yegorov, were air strikes and ground-to-ground rocket attacks on "strategic 
objects" in Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials appealed to journalists and other noncombatants to leave the 
city. But five anti-war members of the Russian Parliament remained there in 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechen authorities threatened to execute 20 captured Russian soldiers if 
bombing started. From an old Soviet textbook, they read instructions on 
television to the estimated 200,000 people still in Grozny on how to use 
grenades to cripple invading tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the bombing starts, we will go to our shelters, and when it is finished 
we will go out to defend the city," said Chechen government spokesman Movladi 
Yudugov. 
</P>
<P>
 As the deadline approached, a defiant mood gripped the Chechen capital, a city 
of half-finished apartment blocks and decrepit oil refineries 1,000 miles south 
of Moscow. Reporters leaving the city said roads were crowded with both people 
fleeing and gunmen driving in to defend the place. The main square was packed 
with part of the republic's irregular army of several thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechnya's militant nationalism poses the most serious challenge to President 
Boris N. Yeltsin's government since Communists and other hard-liners seized the 
Parliament building in Moscow in October, 1993, and staged a two-day armed 
rebellion that was put down by tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing an unraveling of the huge, multiethnic Russian Federation, Yeltsin has 
refused to recognize Chechnya's independence. But only in recent months has he 
gone along with demands by hawks in his government to crush the secession 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council, which met for three hours in the Kremlin hospital where 
Yeltsin is recovering from nose surgery, chose to resort to bombs and rockets 
after a week of sluggish, hesitant convergence on Grozny by thousands of troops 
in three columns of tanks -- Moscow's biggest such operation since the war in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 One tank column commander was recalled from Chechnya on Saturday after halting 
his advance 20 miles west of Grozny and promising villagers that his men would 
never fire on civilians, regardless of orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of air attacks was a shift that came after Yeltsin delayed a 
Thursday deadline for Chechnya to disarm within 48 hours and offered to send a 
"full-powered high-level delegation" to meet Dudayev. Prime Minister Viktor S. 
Chernomyrdin announced Friday that he would head the Russian side and meet 
anywhere Dudayev wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 First Dudayev balked, insisting that Russia pull its troops out before he 
would talk, and by Saturday the offer from Chernomyrdin had vanished. The 
Security Council gave Dudayev an ultimatum to come to Mozdok, a military 
garrison town in southern Russia, to work out the details of disarming Chechnya 
with Yegorov and Sergei V. Stepashin, Russia's chief of counterintelligence -- 
two key figures in the military operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this does not happen, no other question will be discussed," a Russian 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel general rejected the ultimatum but appealed twice, to Chernomyrdin 
and then to Yeltsin, for talks "at a proper level" on all issues, including the 
disarming of Chechen fighters. He reminded Yeltsin that the rebel forces were 
under orders not to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Interfax news agency reported that a telegram sent to Yeltsin at 9 p.m. 
arrived in Yeltsin's office 30 minutes after the midnight deadline expired. But 
the Itar-Tass news agency quoted well-informed sources as saying that the 
telegram had arrived before midnight. The Kremlin did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin and a shrinking circle of hawkish supporters have also ignored a 
monthlong chorus of anti-war protest from inside Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's Parliament, took Dudayev's 
side Saturday in demanding high-level peace talks and a cease-fire. Yegor T. 
Gaidar, once Yeltsin's acting prime minister and close adviser, called the 
Security Council ultimatum "a tragic mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 "They talk about disarming illegal armed units, but I cannot imagine how the 
whole Chechen nation could be disarmed now," said Ruslan Aushev, president of 
the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia. "Starting from 15-year-old 
boys, and even younger, all who can carry weapons, including women, have risen 
to defend their republic. They are ready to hold on to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Moscow said the Russian troops outside Grozny would enter the 
city to collect arms. But their willingness to attempt this against violent 
resistance was in doubt. Just one of the three columns, the one moving from the 
north, has managed to reach the edge of the city after a week in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian troops deliberately left roads south from the city open, to allow 
unarmed people to flee. But the Interior Ministry said Chechen fighters had 
also left in that direction to set up camps in the mountains and launch a 
guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said Yeltsin was preparing a decree to impose a Moscow-appointed 
government in Chechnya that would call new elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with wariness in the West over the Kremlin's drift toward war, the 
Foreign Ministry appealed for understanding of actions against "a threat of 
armed extremism" in "an inalienable part of the Russian Federation." 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; THE HIDDEN DEVASTATION OF CRACK; THE EPIDEMIC IS EATING AWAY

DRUG-ADDICTED BABIES ARE HAVING AN IMPACT AS GREAT AS THE RECESSION.

<P>
 A decade after crack cocaine first flooded the streets of Los Angeles, its 
legacy of destruction ranks among the most deadly, costly and socially upending 
catastrophes to confront the nation's most populous county. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1984, crack has destroyed one undernourished neighborhood after another, 
devouring countless souls who have succumbed to its seductively cheap price and 
powerful high. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crisis has not been the sole province of junkies, or the exclusive 
headache of police and bureaucrats. Like an earthquake radiating damage far 
beyond the epicenter, crack has sent shock waves through the region's major 
public institutions, imposing a vast hidden tax on an unsuspecting populace. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sentinels of community safety -- police, prosecutors, emergency room 
doctors and those charged with protecting children -- crack was a surprise 
attack by a strange new enemy, one of unstoppable power and momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 As officials scrambled to throw up defenses, the drug's drain on public 
agencies became enormous, running into the hundreds of millions of dollars 
annually and stealing tax money desperately needed for libraries, recreation, 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't even know, (but crack) really eroded the quality of their 
lives," says former Los Angeles County Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. 
Dixon, who for more than two decades oversaw a wide array of government 
outlays. "(They) think it is Proposition 13 or the recession, but probably at 
least as great a part of the equation is simply what has happened with crack 
cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid signs that crack's grip on the region has loosened, the full cost and 
scope of the institutional havoc remain largely untallied and intangible. But 
this much is clear: 
</P>
<P>
 * Children of the crisis have been flooding public agencies -- and pushing up 
costs -- on a scale never before seen. The number of abused and neglected 
children required to live apart from their parents has doubled since crack's 
arrival to nearly 40,000. About 20,000 to 30,000 babies in the county have been 
exposed to crack during pregnancy, and thousands more arrive each year, adding 
millions to public hospital costs and special care programs. "The child welfare 
system was turned upside-down by crack cocaine," says county children's 
services chief Peter Digre. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crack dramatically changed the cost and character of crime across the 
county, helping fuel widespread fear about public safety. It has been among the 
engines driving the outlay of hundreds of millions of dollars for law 
enforcement and jail expansion. Among other things, the highly addictive 
stimulant created more street violence and gang warfare, contributing to a 
sharp jump in shootings, assaults and juvenile homicides. It has permeated the 
criminal underworld so extensively that about half of the arrestees passing 
through the jail system test positive for cocaine -- most of it crack. 
</P>
<P>
 * Because of crack's powerful side effects, health care costs have soared. 
Crack users by the thousands have poured into hospitals, often 
hyper-stimulated, in seizures or having heart attacks. At the county morgue, a 
trickle of cocaine-related drug deaths swelled more than tenfold as crack's 
popularity grew. Cocaine -- most of it crack -- figures in about 500 fatalities 
a year in the county and exceeds heroin as the leading substance cited in drug 
abuse deaths. "From a public health perspective, I don't think there has been 
(any drug) that has paralleled crack," says Caswell Evans, director of the 
county's community health programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack is by no means the only culprit in Los Angeles' costly plague of crime, 
addiction and child abuse. Yet there is little disagreement that it is the 
county's most prevalent and menacing illegal drug -- one invisible to millions 
of residents because it has not poisoned their own families or cut a 
slaughterous swath through their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as now-retired county Supervisor Ed Edelman can tell you, crack's ravages 
are not confined by ZIP code. As he puts it: "It's not someone else's problem." 
The Children of Crack 
</P>
<P>
 For Sharron Jean Murray, it all s eemed so innocent, so fun, in those early 
days when crack came to her Crenshaw district neighborhood. "It was like no 
other feeling I ever had," she says of her first taste of the drug. "It made me 
brave."  
</P>
<P>
 But a decade later, the 40-year-old Murray stands as one small measure of 
crack's far-reaching strain on the coffers of public agencies, particularly 
those charged with protecting children. In 1989, at one of the low point s of 
her addiction, Murray was emaciated, bingeing on crack and six months pregnant 
when she went into labor.  
</P>
<P>
 After she was rushed by ambulance to County-USC Medical Center, doctors 
performed an emergency Cesarean. Her 4-pound daughter, immediately taken into 
county custody, had high levels of cocaine in her system and water on the brain 
, and was hospitalized for three months. Murray says the child eventually 
recovered, spending about three years in foster care before being adopted. Her 
two other children have spent seven years in county-supervised placement, one 
in foster care and one with a relative.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere has the collateral damage of the crack epidemic been more cruel -- and 
the consequences more costly -- than among children. 
</P>
<P>
 As the drug has claimed more and more parents, unprecedented numbers of 
tax-supported children have landed in foster homes or with relatives. A new 
study conducted by the county Department of Children's Services, in response to 
a Times request, found at least one parent abusing crack in 44% of a random 
sample of cases involving 613 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of children affected by the epidemic are moving through the 
public school system across the county, presenting unique challenges for 
teachers and adding to high-cost, special education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack was even responsible for the creation of an entirely new, and now 
leading, category of child abuse: exposure of babies to drugs during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 From 2,500 to 3,000 drug-exposed newborns are reported to child welfare 
workers in the county annually, with studies showing that up to 80% of the 
cases involve cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crack has become explosively the No. 1 illegal drug affecting pregnancy," 
said psychiatrist Michael Durfee, a county health official who coordinates 
child abuse prevention programs. The financial toll is staggering, partly 
because crack tends to induce labor and premature births. The cost of treating 
drug-exposed infants -- overwhelmingly involving crack -- at the county's 
public hospitals was estimated at $22 million in 1991, the most recent figures 
available. Even the least serious cases of prenatal crack exposure can cost 
$8,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The most severe cases are both tragic and astronomically expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 One 21-month-old baby girl born prematurely and suffering lung ailments and 
other complications died this spring at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center in Willowbrook after spending her entire life in the hospital -- mostly 
in an intensive care ward -- at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried hard to get this kid (to a foster home)," says Dr. Xylina Bean, the 
center's director of neonatology, looking at a bulletin board picture of the 
round-faced child with thick glasses. "She needed to have parents . . . to live 
like a child for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Most children get out alive. But when they do, many pour into an overburdened 
child welfare system, which has doubled its caseload in the last 10 years and 
is spending about $200 million more a year to keep up with the crack onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 When it first hit, shellshocked social workers responded -- some say 
overreacted -- by scooping up young children from homes where any crack use was 
detected. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster parents were not trained to deal with these children, and the 
population at MacLaren Children's Center, the county's main shelter, ballooned 
threefold. Day rooms were converted to sleeping quarters. The center's 
infirmary was overflowing with crack babies. At one point, "the Fire Code 
prevented any more children from (entering) that facility," says Sandra Turner 
Settles, then a manager at MacLaren. Soon, crack-exposed newborns were backing 
up in hospitals and private treatment centers, sometimes waiting months for 
placement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the system has gradually adjusted -- more children are being placed 
with relatives and more families are being held together with closer 
supervision -- crack continues to complicate child welfare work. 
</P>
<P>
 Overwhelmingly that is because crack has hooked more women -- many of them 
mothers -- than any other hard drug. The effect has been devastating because 
mothers are traditionally the ones social workers turn to in their efforts to 
bind families together. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of the emotional and developmental toll crack has exacted on a 
generation of children remains largely a guessing game, as does the long-term 
burden for taxpayers. Special education, medical and other services up to age 
18 for just one child seriously affected by drug exposure in the womb could 
total $750,000, the federal government has estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the worst fears of the "crack baby" crisis have not been realized. 
Dire predictions that networks of special schools would be required to handle 
legions of disabled, uncontrollable crack children have been discarded. "Many 
of the children are doing better than we thought," said Roberta Savage, a drug 
abuse specialist with the county superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, children impaired by crack exposure -- as well as youngsters 
raised in the chaotic households of drug-using parents -- can have problems 
relating to others, as well as fears, phobias and poor attention spans. 
</P>
<P>
 Deanne Tilton, who heads a countywide panel that monitors child-abuse issues 
and services, is seeing more young people who "can't concentrate. They can't 
read. They don't have much of a conscience. They are more violent, more 
depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago -- about the time the first children of the crack epidemic were 
reaching school -- teachers and administrators in the small Lennox School 
District near Los Angeles International Airport began noticing kindergarten and 
first-grade students with unusual behavioral and learning problems. Some were 
aggressive. Some isolated themselves. Many had to be taught the same things 
again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really frustrating. It takes time away from students really ready to 
move along," says teacher Marianne Gilliams, who has taught several of the 
youngsters, some of them exposed to drugs as infants. "You tend to focus on 
these children because they have other needs . . . they are very inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the causes of these new classroom problems are difficult to define, 
many educators, including Lennox Administrator Tina Manscilla, are convinced 
that crack has played a major role. 
</P>

 Now, some of the children of the crack crisis are approaching their teen-age 
years, traditionally a time for troubled children to strike out with 
misbehavior or even delinquency. Some see a second generation of misery in the 
making. Making the Streets Meaner 
</P>
<P>
 Both before and after the birth of her premature daughter, Sharron Murray was 
no stranger to crime. Back in St. Louis, where she grew up, she had seen family 
members and friends ravaged by drugs and alcohol. When she was a teen-ager, one 
of her mother's boyfriends paid her for sex, and so began her first foray into 
prostitution. When she came to Los Angeles in 1980, it was for a fresh start.  
</P>
<P>
 But like so many other addicts, Murray would soon do whatever it took to get 
cash for crack. She descended into streetwalking and compiled a string of 17 
arrests for prostitution, petty theft, probation violations and narcotics 
charges. Through the revolving door of the criminal justice system -- a few 
days here, two weeks there, then two months -- Murray spent the equivalent of 
more than a year in County Jail and nine months in state prison. "I had to have 
. . . some crack," she says, "no matter what it cost me."  
</P>

 Crack cocaine gave street crime a new image: capricious, savage, omnipresent. 
In malevolent synergy, it converged with proliferating gangs and escalating 
violence to heighten public anxiety, fan police-neighborhood tensions and 
rearrange government outlays. It made it harder to get a cop when you needed 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack's rise paralleled the arc of violent crime in Los Angeles: Both climbed 
steeply in the mid-1980s, peaked a few years ago and then began to taper off. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming of crack has meant "much more bizarre behavior and random violence 
. . . (a) change in the nature of crime," Sheriff Sherman Block says. "Crack 
cocaine and the revenue that it produced is a factor in gangs getting greater 
mobility, getting automobiles and acquiring more sophisticated and deadly 
weapons. It meant . . . more violence and greater risk to the community and law 
enforcement . . . creating fear." 
</P>
<P>
 It has meant destruction, corrosion, on almost unimaginable levels. Even the 
Webster Commission cited it as one factor that made the city "a tinderbox ready 
to explode" in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 With the debut of crack, police were saturated by citizens' complaints about 
drug dealers crowding corners and front yards. Robberies, homicides and 
prostitution followed. Gradually, gang members began swirling around the crack 
trade and violent turf battles intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people committed murders at an astonishing rate. Juvenile homicide 
arrests climbed 187% in Los Angeles County between 1985 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Narcotics agents such as Detective Richard Ginelli, a 30-year veteran, who 
learned the neighborhoods of South-Central Los Angeles young and has spent most 
of his career there, had watched many drugs join the street bazaar. But nothing 
like this. "Rock cocaine just took over," Ginelli says. "It just came on like a 
wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Open-air crack markets were leapfrogging from corner to corner, neighborhood 
to neighborhood. Cash -- more than narcotics officers had ever seen -- was in 
motion everywhere. "You'd go into (a drug dealer's) home and get $30,000, 
$40,000, $50,000. We never saw that with heroin," Ginelli says. 
</P>
<P>
 Police stations, unable to keep up, routinely began running out of officers to 
handle citizens' calls for service. Residents regularly began upbraiding police 
at public forums, accusing them of being in league with the crack dealers. "We 
lost control," says former LAPD Assistant Chief Jesse Brewer, the man in charge 
of police stations in the southern section of the city through much of the 
1980s. "The people lost confidence (and) crack cocaine was a major factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to gain the upper hand, federal, state and local agencies threw 
resources into high-profile -- often controversial -- law enforcement sweeps 
and task forces that zeroed in on mid-level dealers and large suppliers. 
Cocaine seizures increased tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
 In the heat of the battle, the district attorney's central narcotics bureau 
alone handled as many as 1,000 new crack cases a month. "It was a . . . 
nightmare," says Deputy Dist. Atty. John Perlstein, who has spent 10 years 
plowing through stacks of incoming drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The frenzy of the early response has subsided somewhat, but crack continues to 
reach far beyond the world of users. "If you hear about someone shot by a 
burglar, nine times out of 10 it's a crack addict," Perlstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he was arrested on possession charges earlier this year, Moshe Yurom 
Riggs, 19, was living on the streets of Hollywood and feeding a crack habit by 
stealing car stereos -- perhaps 100 in all. "Every night," says Riggs, who is 
now in a county-funded recovery program and awaiting trial. "It was easier than 
panhandling." Other crackheads in the area favored residential and commercial 
burglaries, he says. "You don't care about anything or anybody. You do what you 
have to do to get that next hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Such opportunistic and random crimes escalated public fear, tilting government 
spending toward criminal justice and away from a range of other services. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most striking examples is the money pumped into the sprawling 
County Jail system, one of the nation's largest. Although it is hard to picture 
now, in the late 1970s county lockups were being mothballed for lack of 
inmates. But in the early 1980s -- in a reversal Sheriff Block traces partly to 
the advent of crack -- the jail count was surging, eventually doubling to more 
than 20,000. Outlays for personnel and equipment tripled to nearly $400 million 
before dipping slightly. And a $500-million expansion program was launched, 
adding thousands of cells from Lynwood to Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time jails were being expanded, libraries were being closed and 
resources squeezed for youth programs, treatment efforts, recreational 
offerings -- services some believe could address the social ailments feeding 
demand for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have parks in Los Angeles County that have no recreation programs," Dixon 
says. "But they still have park police who patrol." An Epidemic in Public 
Health 
</P>
<P>
 So relentlessly did Sharron Murray pursue her addiction that nothing -- not 
her arrests, not the loss of her children, not even her deteriorating health -- 
could come between her and her crack pipe. Murray smoked so much for so long 
while living in alleys and cheap motels that she severely damaged her teeth and 
gums, further burdening taxpayers who have picked up the bills for her neglect 
and abuse. Still, Murray sees herself as one of the lucky ones. "I'm glad it 
was not death for me," she says.  
</P>

 They arrive in convulsions from overdoses. They are wheeled in with gunshot 
wounds from drug deals gone bad. Some stumble in after darting in front of a 
passing car or truck. Others simply are sick from their addiction and wind up 
in the waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
 No single drug has overburdened the county's public health care system more 
than crack cocaine. At hospitals across the county, the number of 
cocaine-related medical emergencies has leaped more than 500% since 1983, with 
all indications that the largest share of the increase is from crack users. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dennis Chan, who has been on the front lines at County-USC Medical 
Center's emergency ward for six years, says crack underlies most of the serious 
and violent cases he sees. Victims of knifings, shootings and serious accidents 
usually are found to have cocaine in their systems, he says. It is common for 
the hospital to treat several acute crack overdoses in a single night. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Margaret McCarron, a drug overdose expert at the hospital, says that 
because of crack's great potency, addicts often suffer serious damage to their 
organs. Some require on-going hemodialysis and expensive treatments. Others 
require hospital admission and intensive care, boosting costs sky-high. "It was 
a major medical problem," McCarron says. One recent national study found that 
crack and other narcotics abusers typically tie up hospital beds several days 
longer than other patients because their immune systems tend to be weakened. 
The study revealed that as much as one in five tax dollars spent in public 
hospitals is related to substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 More difficult to quantify, but no less worrisome, is the connection between 
crack and the transmission of the AIDS virus by the countless female addicts 
who sell themselves for a hit. Doctors at King/Drew Medical Center say most of 
the pediatric AIDS cases they treat involve streetwalking mothers who use 
crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they have not determined how much of the $2.6 billion spent 
annually on the county's health care system may be tied to crack. But Walter 
Gray, who oversees administration of county hospitals, says there is no doubt 
that the drug has helped clog the arteries of the entire public health system. 
"It's the whole continuum of care," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many pursue their addiction beyond the reach of medical help. With the rise of 
crack, cocaine-related drug deaths in the county leaped from 45 in 1982 to a 
peak of more than 600 in 1989, before dipping slightly. That does not even 
include the hundreds upon hundreds of murders that authorities have linked to 
the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence is a No. 1 public health issue (and) the No. 1 cause of that is 
drugs," Gray says. "Crack is the drug of choice." 
</P>
<P>
 The burdens on hospitals from such mayhem are extraordinary because the 
resulting injuries often require long-term care. In particularly severe 
crack-linked cases -- such as spinal damage -- patients are sent to such 
county-funded rehabilitation centers as Rancho Los Amigos, where taxpayers foot 
the bill. Lessons for Tomorrow 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnant again, living in alleyways near MacArthur Park, violating her parole 
and still chasing crack, Sharron Murray was at an all-time low earlier this 
year, when a friend persuaded her to seek help.  
</P>
<P>
 "My whole face was disfigured from malnutrition. I couldn't afford no more 
arrests. . . . And I needed for her to be born drug-free," says Murray of her 
4-month-old daughter, Naderia . 
</P>
<P>
 Murray has spent eight months in a county-funded treatment program in Long 
Beach at a cost of more than $15,000. She attends counseling and classes, helps 
with chores and recently was named an "elder" at the center. She also is coming 
to grips with an abusive childhood and the pain she has caused as an adult.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have amends to make (to my family)," she says. "I have an amend to make to 
the taxpayers as well . "  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, like Sharron Murray, is at a turning point -- though it is far 
from clear where either goes from here. Crack appears to be ebbing in 
popularity, particularly among young people in poorer neighborhoods, where many 
have witnessed the wreckage in their families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, crack remains the leading street narcotic in Los Angeles County, and 
policy-makers continue to struggle with a large, difficult and resilient core 
of chronic users who are weighing heavily on law enforcement and social welfare 
agencies. In the central area of the county, narcotics arrests are down about 
40% since 1989, but cocaine -- most of it crack -- still accounts for nearly 
three out of four cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrenched pockets of homelessness and street camping are linked in part to 
crack addiction. Millions of dollars a month continues to be spent caring for 
children who cannot live with their crack-using parents. And officials report 
about 2,000 newborns each year with cocaine in their systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lessons, however, have been learned. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce costs and narrow the trail of human tragedy, state and federal 
agencies have started to fund more prenatal programs designed to clean up 
addicted mothers before they give birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers, rather than breaking up homes, are placing more emphasis on 
saving families and rebuilding parental responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of experimental programs is targeting drug-abusing women and their 
families for intensive recovery services. A new Downtown drug court is trying 
to curb recidivism among crack users by intensely monitoring their drug 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts say such strategies not only are humane but cost-effective 
because they attack problems before they become an enormous and continuing 
drain, affecting multiple generations. 
</P>
<P>
 One crucial area that many observers still believe needs rethinking is that 
treatment programs and their funding have never adjusted to meet the crack 
challenge. Admissions to the county's publicly funded treatment programs -- 
typically about 33,000 a year -- have varied little since before crack use 
exploded. The overwhelming majority of admissions continue to be for heroin 
addiction, even though some recent studies show far more people use cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you see in the statistics of treatment admissions is dumb, dumb, dumb 
social policy," says UCLA researcher Douglas Anglin. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who complete programs targeted at crack addicts, usage declines by 
nearly 50%, and several dollars in crime and health costs are saved for each 
dollar spent on treatment, according to a recent study funded by Gov. Pete 
Wilson's Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the belief that drug treatment money has been misdirected, officials 
are also concerned that too much of our drug control efforts are skewed toward 
law enforcement and prison-building. Sheriff Block, for one, sees that as 
shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never approached the total issue," he says. "We've never done an 
adequate job at the border interdicting drugs. We've dragged our feet on 
spending -- and still don't spend enough -- on prevention. We still don't have 
meaningful treatment programs (that) attach some strings to it." 
</P>
<P>
 What's lacking most of all, many experts say, is a full appreciation of what 
crack has wrought for Los Angeles and any sense of a comprehensive, broad 
strategy to snap the drug's costly cycle of destruction. Former LAPD Deputy 
Chief and anti-drug czar Glenn Levant, who now heads a national drug abuse 
prevention program, says: "There was never any coordinated approach to this 
epidemic, and that remains so today." 
</P>
<P>
 So, for now, Los Angeles appears to have settled into a long war of attrition 
with crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sharron Murray says she not only owes an apology to taxpayers but her thanks 
as well for a second chance. In all, during a decade of careening addiction, 
she cost taxpayers at least $250,000 for incarcerating, prosecuting and 
defending her in court, feeding and sheltering her children, caring for her 
premature baby and trying to break her craving for cocaine.  
</P>
<P>
 Now clean after years at the ragged front edge of the epidemic, Murray says 
she is gaining self-confidence and the emotional tools to resist backsliding . 
"I want to be able to work," she says. "And take care of my family."  
</P>
<P>
 It's no small ambition and Murray candidly acknowledges the lure of the drug 
could catch her again once she leaves the confines of her treatment center. It 
is a chilling prospect, she says, because "if I fall again, I won't fight for 
recovery. I won't."  
</P>
<P>
 Murray says her publicly financed recovery has rekindled her aspirations and 
given her some measure of hope: "The county," she says simply, "saved my life."

 Many in Los Angeles will remember 1984 not for the splendor of the Olympic 
Games but as the year crack cocaine started spreading its wickedness in their 
neighborhoods. In the beginning, it seemed like no big deal, just another drug 
-- or at least so many people thought. But like an invisible brush fire, it 
began burning everything it touched. With alarming speed, crack cocaine became 
urban America's worst drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of us have not endured the despondency of addiction or 
experienced the terror of a neighborhood under siege by crack pushers and 
users, everyone has been touched by this epidemic. As the spotlight shined on

cocaine was insidiously undermining our quality of life.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) What Is Crack? 
</P>
<P>
 Crack is a highly addictive form of cocaine. Kitchen chemists make it by 
mixing cocaine with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), adding water 
and heating to remove the hydrochloride. The final product is a cocaine that 
can be smoked. Crack got its name from the cracking sound the drug makes when 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the drug is smoked, rather than injected or snorted, gives it 
its awesome power. It travels much more quickly to the brain, creating a 
greater rush -- and a stronger appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, crack creates its addiction by interfering with a chemical, called 
a neurotransmitter, that the brain releases to carry a message across the gap 
between cells. Nerves that send a pleasure message to the brain stay on, rather 
than quickly turning off, causing the "high." But eventually the nerve cell 
that makes the chemical stops making more. That is part of the reason that 
after the high, a crack user quickly loses the sense of exhilaration and mental 
clarity, and needs more crack. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart rate goes through wild fluctuations, sometimes failing altogether. 
Blood pressure goes up, blood vessels constrict, increasing the possibility of 
strokes. Addicts suffer from an increased sense of paranoia, aggressive 
behavior and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term consequences are uncertain because the drug has only been in the 
mass market for a decade. 
</P>

<P>
 Late 1983: Murray, collecting welfare and doing occasional work at beauty 
salons, lives in the Crenshaw area with a daughter when she first tries a 
marijuana cigarette sprinkled with crack cocaine. She sinks quickly into 
addiction, and begins selling possessions to buy more drugs. 
</P>
<P>

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Crack and Fractured Families 
</P>
<P>
 A county Department of Children's Services study, conducted in response to 
Times inquiries, has documented a strong connection between crack cocaine use 
and cases of child abuse and neglect, which have doubled since the drug's 
popularity exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have long believed that crack has a profound impact on the county's 
$800-million-a-year child welfare system. But the study of 300 cases involving 
613 children is the first to specifically correlate crack with child welfare 
caseloads. Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * 44% of all cases reviewed involved one or more parents who abused crack 
cocaine. Only 25% abused other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than one in four of the cases included a drug-exposed newborn, and 81% 
of those involved crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crack-exposed infants require more ongoing specialized services, primarily 
medical care, than newborns exposed to other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crack-related cases consumed more social worker time than other cases 
reviewed in the survey, although accurate cost comparisons of services and 
staff time could not be made. 
</P>
<P>
 * Families with parents who used crack had on average more than two children 
in protective placement -- 13% more than parents abusing other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children of crack users remain in foster placement two years and four months 
on average, about the same as cases involving other drug abuse or no drug 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proportionally more attempts are made to reunify families where crack was 
used and a slightly greater share are successful, compared to other types of 
cases. The reasons are unclear, but analysts speculated that the larger number 
of crack cases involving drug-exposed newborns and attempts to reunite them 
with mothers may be a factor.

CARTER EMBARKS TO TRY MEDIATING BOSNIA CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter left for the former Yugoslav federation Saturday 
night to begin his third independent peace mission to an international hot spot 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was invited to participate in the negotiations over the future of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, whose separatists 
appear to be on the verge of winning the bloody Balkan war. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President's trip follows two other free-lance diplomatic forays -- 
one in Haiti, where he helped speed the departure of military dictator Raoul 
Cedras, and the other in North Korea, where he succeeded in improving 
negotiations over nuclear issues. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, the Clinton Administration offered only tepid support for 
Carter's special brand of crisis intervention, expressing doubts that he can 
make a useful contribution toward ending the complex and frustrating situation. 
</P>
<P>
 They also were clearly unhappy that the invitation came from the Bosnian 
Serbs, who have been viewed by the United States as the aggressors in the 
vicious conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been skeptical about the ability of former President Carter to try to 
resolve those issues because they are very complicated and because we have seen 
that, frankly, the motives (of) the parties are always suspect," White House 
Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Panetta said, the White House has provided Carter with logistics 
assistance and wished him well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we say God bless him. If he can find a way to solve some of those 
problems, fine," Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials briefed Carter on the Bosnian situation Friday. Carter departed 
from Atlanta by commercial jet Saturday evening, bound for Frankfurt, Germany. 
There he is to be briefed again by Charles Redman, the U.S. ambassador to 
Germany and a former U.S. special envoy to Yugoslavia, according to the State 
Department and the Carter Center in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter then plans to travel by U.S. military aircraft to Zagreb, Croatia, 
where he expects to meet Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic. He had not yet decided Saturday whether to visit the 
embattled Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said one of his first efforts will be to assess whether Karadzic has 
complied with the six points agreed to as a condition of Carter's involvement 
in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The points were: calling an immediate cease-fire in the Sarajevo area; ending 
the harassment of U.N. relief operations; releasing detained U.N. troops; 
releasing Bosnian government soldiers under 19 years of age; permitting the 
reopening of Sarajevo's airport, and guaranteeing human rights in areas under 
Serbian control. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said Karadzic had assured him that progress had been made, but the 
former President acknowledged that he could not verify that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There obviously have been some positive developments, but the exact situation 
concerning all the points is impossible to ascertain at this time," Carter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter has stressed that he does not intend to become a permanent negotiator 
on Bosnia and said again Saturday that he will not try to develop an 
independent peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, he will urge Karadzic to accept the peace plan outlined by 
negotiators from the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- 
known as the Contact Group -- that would partition the country between the 
Serbian rebels and a federation of the Muslim-led government and the Bosnian 
Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan would give 51% of the territory to the Muslim-Croat federation and 
49% to the Serbs, who now hold more than 70%. The Bosnian government and the 
Croats have already accepted the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "My purpose in traveling to the region is to seek ways to contribute to the 
cessation of hostilities and to encourage the acceptance of the Contact Group's 
plan as the basis for negotiations," Carter said in a statement released 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Carter also has insisted that he will not take sides in the 
ethnic war but will listen to the views of both the Bosnian government and 
Karadzic's Serbian insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
 That evenhanded approach contrasts with the official policy of the Clinton 
Administration, which regards the Serbs as the primary aggressors in the 
conflict and considers the Bosnian Muslims the primary victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, while acknowledging that all sides have committed 
egregious acts in the 2 1/2-year Bosnian war, has accused the Serbs of a long 
list of war crimes stemming from their policy of "ethnic cleansing" -- a 
program of murder, torture and intimidation intended to force non-Serbs out of 
areas under Serbian control. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's departure for the region came on a day when the airport in Sarajevo 
opened to U.N. Protection Force flights for the first time in nearly a month. 
But the situation in Bosnia remained anything but tranquil Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sarajevo woman, walking with her young son in the city's notorious "sniper 
alley," was gunned down and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a French NATO jet patrolling the skies over Bosnia was struck by 
ground fire and forced to land at an Italian air base. The source of the 
gunfire in both incidents was still being investigated late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In northwest Bosnia, rebel Muslim forces supported by Croatian Serbs were 
reported to have overtaken the town of Velika Kladusa in the Bihac pocket, 
which had been controlled by the Bosnian government army's 5th Corps. And the 
United Nations reported new evidence of Bosnian Serb ethnic cleansing of Muslim 
residents in the Bijeljina area of northeast Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still face a pretty grim situation," said U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U. 
"Our anti-sniping patrols in Sarajevo have been cut way back because the fuel 
situation is so desperate there." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the celebrated reopening of the airport did not come without glitches and 
conditions. Only three of five requested flights were allowed to land, 
prompting the United Nations to lodge "strong protests at a very high level," 
said Thant. One of the planes brought an advance team for Carter, while the 
others were designated for rotation of U.N. peacekeepers and other personnel.

CITRON WAS EMBITTERED, DEFENSIVE, FRIENDS SAY; PROFILE: AS CRITICISM MOUNTED 
OVER THE YEAR, THE FORMER ORANGE COUNTY TREASURER TOOK IT PERSONALLY AND HARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About a year ago, his friends began noticing a change in Bob Citron, then the 
highly respected treasurer of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just couldn't take even constructive questioning, let alone constructive 
criticism," said Gary Granville, the county clerk and Citron's old friend. "Not 
even, 'Bob, are you sure you're right?' He'd be offended. It's a telltale 
sign." 
</P>
<P>
 It got worse as Citron's election opponent -- the first to ever challenge him 
in his 24 years in office -- mounted his campaign. Though the campaign was tame 
by Orange County standards, concentrating on issues of risk, not personalities, 
Citron took it personally and hard, Granville said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hurt, offended, angry, embittered, self-righteous, defensive -- just all 
those things. It kind of just really unnerved him. . . . When you and I would 
maybe pull back, he plunged ahead and kept betting the wrong line." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, who had become accustomed to praise for the high return he got on his 
investments, escalated his gambles with the county's investment fund. And 
finally, he lost. Now the fund is being liquidated with losses estimated at 
$2.02 billion. The county government has filed for bankruptcy, and Citron has 
resigned, secluding himself at his Santa Ana home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a psychologist, but I think there's something deep going on here," 
Granville said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other friends describe Citron as extremely likable and hard-working, in 
the last year to a point just short of obsessive; a rigidly moral person who 
did not drink, smoke, swear or gamble; someone who avoided the usual political 
socializing, preferring lunch at the Elks Club with old friends; someone who 
was extremely conventional but with striking eccentricities; and finally, a 
person who grew so used to the adulation of his profession that he risked all 
to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no evil or dishonesty here, I know that," Granville said. "It's the 
adulation that clouds your judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron became Orange County treasurer virtually by default. "I don't know of 
anything in his background that would indicate he was a financial wizard," said 
one friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Born into a family that had rooted in Orange County in 1887, he attended USC's 
School of Business Administration but did not obtain a degree, according to 
school records. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, however, become a USC fanatic, forming at least one local alumni 
association, joining local USC athletics boosters, and adorning himself, his 
automobile, even his bathroom, with USC colors and emblems. Friends said he had 
a car horn that played the USC fight song, and his toilet seat is painted 
Trojan cardinal and gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just assumed he was a USC graduate," said a friend. "I never heard Bob say 
that he was, but with all the USC rooting, you'd just assume." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends in Orange County said they know nothing of Citron's years before 
coming to county government. Wayne Gross, a retired Santa Ana firefighter, said 
he has known Citron "a hell of a long time, at least 35, 40 years," but "I 
really don't know his background." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's earliest campaign literature states that he spent 10 years as 
"manager for a large financial institution." An article he wrote in 1973 stated 
that he had been manager of a "finance company." Friends say they have no idea 
what sort of business it might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron left private business in 1960 to join the Orange County tax collector's 
staff. He worked there 10 years, eventually rising to a supervising position, 
then winning an election to succeed the tax collector after he retired in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Some remember the new tax collector as rather shy and withdrawn when he was 
among other county officials. "I knew him probably as well as anybody," said 
Victor A. Heim, then the county's auditor-controller. "Bob was sort of an 
introvert. I don't mean that critically, but he was not the person you'd sit 
down and visit with or go out to lunch with." 
</P>
<P>
 But that, friends say, was only his appearance to outsiders. Within a close 
circle of old and trusted buddies, Citron was open and affable and liked to 
indulge his eccentricities. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the Anti-Slubberdegulion Society, dedicated to the "eradication of 
boredom." He helped form a local W.C. Fields Fan Club because his father, a 
physician, had once helped the famous drinker dry out. Both organizations were 
just whimsical excuses for a tight group of chums to go to restaurants and 
shoot the breeze, said Jerry Kobrin, a newspaper columnist who was part of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's favorite haunt was the Santa Ana Elks Lodge, where he was a senior 
member of "The Jolly Boys," as Walter Kinnear, the restaurant manager, calls 
them. "They have a regular group, The Jolly Boys at the round table. They get 
together and lie to each other. Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday we reserve a 
table for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Citron's eccentricities began showing in public. 
</P>
<P>
 He wore to his office a yellow suit at Easter and a red suit at Christmas and 
almost always wore something from his remarkable collection of turquoise 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 He directed taxpayers to make their checks out to him by name. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, he sent out tax envelopes that bore the maxim "Citron Says: Taxes 
Paid on Time Never Draw Fines." When a county supervisor objected to what 
seemed like Citron's ego-boosting, Citron, an independently elected official, 
mockingly held a contest for a new jingle, himself suggesting, "A diller, a 
dollar, pay your taxes or I'll holler." 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1973, when then-Treasurer Ivan Swanger retired, supervisors 
consolidated the treasurer and tax collector offices and appointed Citron to 
the new post. Citron said he did not welcome the extra duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even had time to think about how I'll operate the department," he 
said. "However, I don't plan to make any changes for at least a year in . . . 
basic policies on investments." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's predecessor as treasurer was the antithesis of Citron when it came to 
fearing risk, Granville said. "Swanger would have liked to bury the money in a 
tin can in the back yard and put two bulldogs over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron benefited from Swanger's assistant, Ray Wells, who stayed on when 
Citron took over the treasurer's office, Granville said. "Ray is a very, very 
nice guy, soft-spoken, kind, good ability," Granville said. "He didn't press 
for any recognition himself. Ray had the financial experience, and I think Bob 
tended to listen to him because he was non-challenging." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, distant from others in his office when it came to investing, placed 
Wells in an adjoining office with glass between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray was the one person Bob would let in on it," Granville said. "It's not 
that Bob was hiding anything, but he was very territorial. Bob and Ray would 
make the (investment) decisions, and Bob would call in the orders." 
</P>
<P>
 As Citron settled into the job, he began to create a new image for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 As tax collector, he had cast himself as a cost-cutter, going to each annual 
County Board of Supervisors budget hearing and requesting a smaller 
departmental budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked that so much," said one county official. "He liked being in the 
presence of important people. He'd read his written statement to the board, 
single-spaced on both sides, and it was chock-full of self-serving statements. 
He enjoyed it. He did have a large ego." 
</P>
<P>
 Now as treasurer, he cast himself as a financial whiz, investing the county's 
funds in more profitable ways. That role became something more after 1978, when 
Proposition 13 passed and clamped limitations on property tax increases. As 
local government budgets got tighter, Citron, whose investments were netting 
increased profits, became something of a savior. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to be kind of a heroic figure among county people," Granville said. 
"Bob would appear with $28 million in unexpected interest and solve a lot of 
problems. He helped bail everyone out so often that he became a kind of guru in 
other people's minds -- and probably in his own mind." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're on a roll -- and he was -- it's human nature to think that roll 
will continue," said Vick Knight, a former Orange County school administrator 
and close friend of Citron's. 
</P>
<P>
 Some governments were so pleased with Citron's earnings record that they 
borrowed money to invest with him. He was treated as a celebrity at county 
treasurers' meetings. In 1988, City & State, a trade magazine, named him one of 
the best county finance officers in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron was advising friends and acquaintances to follow his lead with their 
personal investments, and "a lot were getting on the bandwagon," said one 
acquaintance, who asked not to be named. But he was not pressuring anyone, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband thinks he's great, and he was ready to dump everything we got into 
it. And I kept saying no, no, no. I believe if you can't stand to lose that 
money, you have no business investing that money in a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (Citron) that, and he wasn't angry. He was very friendly, no problem 
whatsoever. He never pressured any of us to invest." 
</P>
<P>
 But the pressure on him to protect his risky investments began to tell this 
year. "I find myself comparing Bob's situation to a baseball pitcher who is 
pitching a no-hitter into the last of the ninth, when maybe he throws the wrong 
pitch," said Knight. "I just think circumstances caught up with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Granville said he and two other county department heads regularly lunched with 
Citron, who insisted that they eat at the Elks Lodge. It is a tribute to the 
pleasure of Citron's company that the three others consented, Granville said. 
</P>
<P>
 We would say, "Oh, god, don't take us there!" But he loved it. He'd walk in, 
and people would say, 'Hi, Bob, Hi, Bob.' He was at home," Granville said. 
</P>
<P>
 But toward the end of 1993, Citron began behaving differently at the lunches, 
Granville said. "Bob was always preoccupied with his work, but it became 
everything to him. He'd go into long, detailed explanations of what he was 
doing. He was totally, I wouldn't say obsessed, but totally preoccupied. It was 
very difficult to talk to him about anything but what he was doing. He'd never 
turn to one of us and say, 'How are things going with you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 About this time, Citron knew he would be challenged for reelection and he was 
also beginning to increase his risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he fearful of a crash? Granville doesn't think so. The pressure was coming 
from elsewhere, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray Wells retired (from the treasurer's office) about a year earlier. I think 
that was a loss to Bob. I think Ray influenced the policy and was a check, and 
it was after Ray left that Bob started managing the fund alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, interest rates were rising, which reduced the investment fund's profits 
and, if they rose further, would threaten the fund's capital itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember that he had received lots of adulation and recognition 
from all corners. The centerpiece of his campaign was an unsolicited letter 
from (County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F.) Riley praising him," 
Granville said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't analyze him -- I'm not a psychologist -- but I think he felt 
compelled to remain No. 1 in the state for interest returned. Absolutely 
compelled. And I think he thought what had worked for him would always work for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 It did not, and the crash was brutal, friends said. Granville called Citron 
just after his resignation, but "we couldn't complete the conversation because 
he was so shaken. I was really concerned. It was his worst nightmare, the very 
worst thing that could happen to him. We all have defenses, but this crushed 
him. I just haven't been able to bring myself to stop by and see him." 
</P>
<P>
 Granville said that what Citron had was all he wanted. He had no ambition to 
climb the political ladder. "He's making $115,000 a year (with perquisites) and 
he has good retirement. Does an assemblyman do that well? No. A supervisor? 
No." 
</P>
<P>
 Kobrin said Citron called him on Dec. 7, three days after his resignation, and 
they talked for a long time, mainly reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sounded like someone who was trying to find a little relief in all the 
pressure. I don't know if he called me for comic relief or just to try to find 
some note of levity in all this." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say the blow struck Citron's wife, Terry, seemingly as hard. The 
couple are remarkably devoted to one another, friends say. "He never goes 
anywhere without her," said one. Both remain at home nowadays, sending out 
their usual Christmas cards and screening their telephone calls, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know him to be an honest individual," said Knight, "and I imagine he's 
devastated now."

BULLETS FIRED AT WHITE HOUSE; NO ONE INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON NATHANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the second such incident in as many months, bullets apparently were fired 
at the White House early Saturday, this time by a gunman who has not been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, 
Chelsea, were asleep in the family quarters of the executive mansion when shots 
were fired at 2:05 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were never in any danger," said Secret Service spokesman Eric 
Harnischfeger. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service agents on duty at the White House and other witnesses reported 
hearing four to six gunshots from the grassy Ellipse south of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, according to Secret Service spokesman Dave Adams, authorities 
recovered two 9-millimeter bullets -- one on the first-floor balcony over the 
South Portico of the White House and the other on the rear driveway. The 
balcony is a floor below the First Family's living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other 9-millimeter slugs were found later in the day, also near the 
portico. Secret Service spokesman Carl Meyer said tests indicated all four 
bullets came from the same gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crime scene search has probably been completed," Meyer added. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two bullets found were largely undamaged, officials said, indicating 
the possibility that they were fired from a distance. Authorities also 
acknowledged that the bullets could have been fired at random and simply fallen 
on the White House grounds by chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are bullets raining all over D.C.," Meyer said, adding that the bullets 
could have been "just a stray couple of rounds." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta told reporters: "We don't know if 
it was someone firing haphazardly from the Ellipse, whether it was someone who 
was driving by and firing." 
</P>
<P>
 In an appearance on CNN's "Evans & Novak" program, Panetta added: "We are 
living at a time when these incidents of violence take place not just in cities 
and communities around this country, they take place here in Washington in 
front of the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they had no suspects and were not certain whether the shots 
were fired from a handgun or shoulder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The President appeared unfazed by the incident and left as scheduled later in 
the morning to deliver his weekly radio address from Northern Virginia 
Community College in suburban Annandale. 
</P>
<P>
 However, instead of leaving through the customary rear driveway, which 
investigators had cordoned off, he left through a Pennsylvania Avenue exit. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House spokesman said the President's schedule was otherwise unaltered. 
</P>
<P>
 The President declined to answer reporters' questions about whether he heard 
the gunshots and whether he felt safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the shots were fired, the President was awakened by Secret Service 
agents checking on his welfare, officials said. Panetta said he received a call 
from the Secret Service at 3 a.m. EST and spoke to Clinton about the gunshots 
later in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode, the third violent incident at the White House in four months, 
once again raised questions about whether the building is adequately protected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Service has suggested creating a restricted zone around the White 
House, bounded by Pennsylvania Avenue to the north, Constitution Avenue on the 
south, 15th Street alongside the Treasury Department and 17th Street alongside 
the Old Executive Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
 But Panetta said the government must weigh any such move carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a free society," he said. "It's a democratic society. And we've got 
to be careful that we try to find that balance between protecting the President 
but also giving people, the people of this country, access to the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 The results of a Treasury Department investigation of White House security are 
due to be released in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began after Frank Corder, an unemployed truck driver with a 
history of substance abuse, crashed a small plane onto the grounds of the White 
House on Sept. 12 in an apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 29, a gunman sprayed semiautomatic weapon fire at the White House from 
Pennsylvania Avenue. Although the shots punctured the building's exterior and 
the Press Room windows, no one was injured. He was wrestled to the ground by

HMO WINS MEDI-CAL PACT DESPITE CRITICAL AUDITS; HEALTH: SEN. WATSON WAS LISTED 
AS BOARD MEMBER WHEN CONTRACT WAS AWARDED. OFFICIALS DENY RECEIVING FAVORS.

<P>
 State health officials recently awarded a no-bid contract potentially worth 
more than $400 million to a Long Beach-based HMO that serves the poor, even 
though state audits repeatedly have found significant deficiencies in the 
health plan's quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract with Molina Medical Centers to treat Medi-Cal mothers and their 
children throughout the state was awarded in May, one month after the newly 
licensed health maintenance organization put state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los 
Angeles) on its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who as chairwoman of the Senate Health Committee oversees health 
programs, said she had helped guide Molina in securing its HMO license from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she said she did nothing to influence the contract, Watson pointed 
out that the company probably got it because she was listed as a board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really great if you can snag the chair of the committee," she said in an 
interview. "Somebody who can really help you." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Watson said that Molina officials used her name without permission 
and that she resigned from the board as soon as she found out. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said Molina got no special treatment, and company officials 
denied that they misused Watson's name. Licensing officials said they have a 
signed document from Watson indicating that she was willing to serve as a board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 The Molina contract was awarded as the California Department of Health 
Services is preparing to channel billions of dollars into a program that will 
make sweeping changes in services for the poor by moving about half the 5.4 
million Medi-Cal enrollees into managed care by mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to select Molina as a prime contractor has prompted health care 
advocates to question whether the state in its rush to expand the managed-care 
program has adequately screened providers and whether political intervention 
has influenced the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism drew an angry response from the company's owner, Dr. C. David 
Molina, who said state auditors have misjudged his clinics' medical care. 
Molina, who opened his first clinic to serve Medi-Cal patients in 1980, said no 
legislator has done him any favors, and he attributed his rapidly growing 
company's success to hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 His son Dr. Joseph M. Molina, vice president of quality assurance, said the 
company has thrived by providing readily accessible medical care with a 
multilingual staff to "a patient population that many have shied away from" 
treating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medi-Cal managed-care program -- a cornerstone of Gov. Pete Wilson's 
cost-saving proposals -- has set off a scramble among HMOs for the 
multimillion-dollar contracts that health officials are awarding without 
competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, health care advocates are demanding closer scrutiny of 
private providers. "Californians pay for the medical care provided the poor 
through state and federal taxes," said Geraldine Dallek, executive director of 
the Center for Health Care Rights. "The state needs to be much more vigilant 
that our taxes are spent only on providers giving high-quality care." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallek, whose organization analyzed the annual audits of Molina and six other 
Medi-Cal managed-care providers under a grant from the Irvine Foundation, is 
scheduled to release a report this week on the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years in a row, state audits have found a "significant deficiency" in 
Molina's quality of care, records show. In 1992, the health officials uncovered 
such a potential threat to patient care at one facility that they considered 
halting Molina's enrollment of new patients, but decided against it because the 
problems were not systemwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, health officials temporarily suspended Molina from signing up 
patients in the Hmong community as a sanction for marketing violations 
involving that Southeast Asian group in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 This September, six months after the Department of Corporations licensed 
Molina as an HMO, auditors from that agency cited the company for violating 
licensing requirements in six categories, including quality assurance, 
accessibility of care and handling of patient grievances, according to a 
confidential audit obtained by The Times. Auditors Visit Clinics 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints, auditors visited three clinics in the Sacramento 
area and examined the treatment of 40 patients. Records show they concluded 
that Molina Medical was systematically denying patients necessary care to boost 
the company's profits. They cited more than a dozen cases, including the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Molina's medical director canceled emergency surgery for a 12-year-old girl 
whose appendix then ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 5-year-old boy with a shattered shinbone waited 18 hours to have his leg 
set in a cast while his pain medication ran out and an orthopedic surgeon tried 
in vain to get authorization from Molina Medical to treat the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 5-year-old boy who displayed the speech patterns of an infant was not 
provided speech therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 10-year-old boy suffered a ruptured eardrum while he waited two years for 
"definitive treatment" of ear infections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medical decisions are being influenced by financial considerations or, if 
not, by medical misjudgment," the auditors reported. "There is far more concern 
with the expense of the care than the quality." 
</P>
<P>
 The medical director declined comment, but Dr. Martha Molina -- David's 
daughter and associate medical director -- said emphatically: "Financial 
decisions do not drive medical decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 David Molina declined to comment on the audit because it is a confidential 
document. But he defended the quality of the health care that his 40 clinics 
provide to the poor in seven counties, including Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside 
and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we do a pretty damn good job frankly, contrary to what some of these 
audits look like," he said. The audits are based on "one-tenth of 1%" of the 
company's 62,000 patient files, producing an inaccurate picture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His son John C. Molina, chief financial officer, produced state statistics 
showing that in 1993 Molina Medical did an equal or better job of screening 
children for preventive health problems than nine other licensed HMOs, even 
though prior state audits had faulted Molina in this area. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials also pointed to their patient surveys that give them high 
marks for service, including trust in the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials said Molina, like other managed care providers, has had 
problems, but nothing severe enough to keep them from getting additional 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Kelly, chief of the Medi-Cal Managed Care Division, said Molina's 
audits do not show "the kind of situation where . . . people are dying in the 
street because of poor care." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that it is unusual for a provider to be cited year after year 
for "significant deficiencies" in its quality of care. But he said Molina 
Medical deserves credit for promptly filing plans to correct problems. "We 
don't want a Band-Aid put on," he said. "They have always made . . . a systemic 
fix." On Blue Shield Board 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, whose South-Central Los Angeles district has a high percentage of 
Medi-Cal beneficiaries, has been closely associated with the health care 
industry and health issues for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 She served nine years on the board of directors of Blue Shield of California 
and reported receiving $5,700 during her last year of service in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the state Fair Political Practices Commission fined Watson $2,000 for 
failing to publicly disclose a $5,000 personal loan given to her by a health 
care lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last several years, Watson's committee has passed legislation that 
has helped mold the state's Medi-Cal managed-care program. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer she carried a bill that creates a commission in Los Angeles to 
award a contract worth about $450 million to serve Medi-Cal patients in this 
county. Molina officials said they intend to compete for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by government contracts and aggressive door-to-door marketing of its 
services, Molina has mushroomed from three clinics treating 5,000 patients in 
1989 into a statewide chain that has received more than $63 million from the 
state during the last 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest contract, awarded May 1, Molina officials were authorized to 
enroll up to 148,000 patients; the state has set a cap of $423 million on 
payments to Molina to treat these patients through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 What opened the door to this major contract award, and other contracts too, 
was an HMO license granted to Molina by the Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 For Molina, the license enlarged the company's scope of services and made it 
eligible for more money and higher reimbursement rates from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were many hurdles. Watson said Molina officials came to her office 
early this year asking for help in guiding them through the bureaucratic maze. 
"I told them how to work the system," Watson said. Time Was of Essence 
</P>
<P>
 The senator said she called the Department of Corporations to advise them that 
Molina's application was on its way. "Don't put it over on the shelf and let it 
sit there all year," she said she told them. 
</P>
<P>
 Time was of the essence for Molina officials, who say they were in a rush to 
get licensed by the April 1 starting date of a new contract to serve 20,000 
people in the Sacramento area. The license was approved in mid-March, the same 
month that the company distributed $15,500 in political contributions to 23 
state legislators, according to LegiTech computerized campaign records. None 
went to Watson, but her campaign had received $500 from Molina several months 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a number of other HMOs make substantial contributions, it was an 
unprecedented outpouring of largess for Molina. "We thought it was a wise thing 
to do at that time," said David Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Corporations officials said the contributions did not have any 
impact on their decision to grant the license, and neither did their receipt of 
a disclosure statement listing Watson as a member of Molina's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Department senior counsel Anita Ostroff said Molina met all licensing 
requirements. She said she reviewed all "relevant information" regarding Molina 
but had not seen copies of the health department's audits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostroff said she relied on verbal assurances by Kelly of the health department 
that the Molina clinics "were in compliance, with no outstanding deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said he had not read the audits either but relied on staff summaries 
when he briefed Ostroff. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys at the National Health Law Program who have critiqued Molina's 
licensing application blasted Ostroff's failure to use "common sense" and 
review critical audits that point to a "track record" of problems with access 
and quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
 Records do show that Ostroff had many reservations about Molina's licensing 
proposal, but her fundamental concern was a potential conflict of interest 
within the family-run company that could result in medical decisions being 
dictated by financial concerns in violation of state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 She questioned whether the company's top executives -- Molina's children -- 
would be sufficiently independent of their father to make the proper medical 
decisions without regard for his pocketbook. Three of David Molina's children 
serve in key posts; the company also employs two other children and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 This question was resolved, Ostroff said, when the company revealed that it 
was expanding its board beyond the family by adding four financially 
disinterested outsiders, including Watson, to serve without compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not blind," Molina wrote the Corporations Department, "to the possible 
perception that a conflict exists when numerous family members hold key 
positions in a health care service plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said she thought the reason Molina officials put her on the board was 
because they were "really pleased that I helped them" with their licensing. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator said she believes the chief advantage of this for Molina would be 
her political clout with the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought, 'Oh, what better person to have on the board than the chair of 
the Senate Health and Human Services Committee,' " Watson said. "They wanted me 
to sit on the board so I could help them." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson noted that Molina's offer was "not an unusual request. I could be on 
1,000 boards right now if I wanted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She agreed to consider Molina's offer but never formally accepted a board 
post, she said, because it would have posed a conflict with her legislative 
oversight responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "For God's sake, get me off that board," she remembered telling her chief of 
staff after a television reporter inquired last spring about her membership on 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 However, her resignation letter was not sent for four months -- and during 
that period, Molina was awarded the state contract potentially worth $423 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina officials said Watson was the company's first choice as an outside 
board member because "she was very knowledgeable about what was happening in 
health care." 
</P>
<P>
 John Molina expressed shock that Watson now says she had not agreed to serve 
on the board. He said all board members filled out and signed forms giving 
identifying information to the Department of Corporations as part of the 
company's licensing application. 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked about this, Watson said she never signed any forms: "Oh, no. 
No, no, no, no, no." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostroff, the Corporations Department attorney, refused to release the 
confidential forms but confirmed that all board members signed the documents 
under penalty of perjury. She said Molina's license would not have been granted 
without the documents and added that Watson has not complained that her name 
was used without her knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, Ostroff said, the department had not received notification 
that Watson had left the board. 
</P>
<P>
 In her Aug. 24 letter of resignation to Molina, Watson did not mention that 
she had been placed on the board without her knowledge. She resigned "with 
sincere regret," citing scheduling conflicts that had prevented her from 
attending the board's only meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said she believes that the health care group "probably" got its 
contract because she was listed as a board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (health officials) look and they see who the board is and they're 
willing to give it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly of the health department said Molina never notified his department that 
Watson was on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 25, when David Molina sent health officials a letter, he advised them 
he was sending a copy to Watson. The letter, addressed to health department 
chief Kimberly Belshe, thanked department officials for speeding up his new 
contract award, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina said in an interview that he sent copies to Watson and two other 
legislators in hopes that his letter would get more attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Belshe, who met with Molina at least twice this year, said the department did 
nothing for Molina that it would not do for any other contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that at Molina's request, the agency did some "technical 
things" to accelerate the contract award, including drafting the language in 
advance of the HMO license approval and streamlining the application process. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Molina had secured the license, the contract was virtually assured 
because health department procedures require the department to contract with 
any willing, qualified HMO that accepts the department's non-negotiable 
reimbursement rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said Molina joins 14 other HMOs that provide managed health care to the 
poor -- the largest is Cigna Healthplans of California, with 114,000 enrollees. 
</P>
<P>
 For Molina to reach its enrollment goal of 148,000 patients, Kelly said, the 
company will have to prove it has the resources and personnel to treat them. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Watson Resignation Letters 
</P>
<P>
 In this letter, Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) resigns from the board of 
directors of Molina Medical Centers, a managed health care group that received 
its HMO license this spring and then got a contract potentially worth $400 
million to serve Medi-Cal patients throughout the state. Watson has said that 
the HMO put her on the board without permission, which company officials deny.

BUDGET KNIVES SURROUND FEARFUL FEDERAL WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is a 58-year-old engineer and MBA who cast his fate with the Energy 
Department 20 years ago, when it was just an office in the Department of the 
Interior. 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed on as it grew, first into an independent federal agency, later into 
a full Cabinet-level department. And now he and his colleagues are girding for 
the worst: tough cutbacks in programs or possible annihilation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous amount of anxiety here, and it's already affected our 
ability to function," said the employee, who -- reflecting the growing concern 
among federal workers -- requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "True, we've been through this before, under Ronald Reagan, but with a 
difference. Now both Congress and the Administration are talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 During the last round of such talk, Democrats still controlled Congress and 
could provide some degree of protection. No more. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a strong energy lobby in Congress that resisted it," said the 
Energy Department careerist. "Now, all of a sudden, there is collusion between 
the two. The only thing making it not quite as bad as it could be is that we 
aren't the only ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Not by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, as both President Clinton and the incoming GOP congressional 
majority have spoken increasingly of tax breaks for the middle class -- paid 
for by severe cutbacks in the federal government -- agencies are under siege as 
never before in this company town. The tremors are being felt everywhere, from 
the civil servants who worry about their livelihoods to advocacy groups trying 
to preserve endangered social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become a bidding war in reverse, with both Clinton and the Republicans 
rushing to outdo each other in their zeal to provide middle-class tax relief 
while slashing government jobs and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is expected to propose ways to cut, eliminate or sell to 
the private sector numerous programs in at least five departments or agencies, 
including the departments of Energy, Transportation and Housing and Urban 
Development, the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming GOP congressional leaders, starting with their own house, have 
announced plans to eliminate numerous committees and caucuses. They have 
notified an estimated 1,300 non-legislative House employees, such as elevator 
operators and mail room workers, that they will no longer be needed after the 
new Congress convenes Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the GOP and Clinton have agreed that the welfare system needs massive 
overhaul, although their respective approaches almost certainly will differ. 
The Republicans also have declared war on regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming congressional leadership has suggested such cost-cutting measures 
as turning the Corporation for Public Broadcasting over to private interests 
and taking another look at Head Start, the popular preschool education program 
for low-income children, begun in 1965 as a cornerstone of the War on Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime federal workers in departments and agencies on the hit list are 
extremely nervous. Although they have heard this kind of talk before, they are 
taking it much more seriously this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all we're talking about," said one 42-year-old woman in the supply 
program at the GSA who began her career at the agency 25 years ago after 
finishing high school. "We've all seen this before, through other 
administrations, but there are differences this time. I think we're all trying 
to figure out if it's real this time. It's very disheartening." 
</P>
<P>
 The GSA is the agency often referred to as the government's "Wal-Mart" because 
it acts like a phone company, landlord, car buyer, supply warehouse and 
purchaser of virtually anything the bureaucracy needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the way home every night -- which is most of my alone time -- I find 
myself thinking of ways to survive," the woman said. "I think: 'I could sell 
the house,' or 'Thank God my son's a junior in college and that's almost 
finished,' things like that. I guess, if that's what I'm doing, this is more 
real than I want to believe. There are so many people here who will be hurt, 
like single parents. It's so sad." 
</P>
<P>
 She and others at the agency question whether any real savings will result. 
"If you abolish something like GSA, they'll just have to re-create these 
offices at a much smaller level," she said. "Ultimately, it will cost the 
taxpayer more because you'll lose our buying power, which is considerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Energy Department employee insisted that while he is not 
opposed to improving efficiency in government, he does not believe that is 
what's fueling the current debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is deadwood in every major organization. And, of course, in government 
there is probably more," he said. "However, this time I believe all of this is 
coming because of the political changes -- changes just for the sake of changes 
-- and that's not good." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal employees historically have been insulated from the kinds of tough 
austerity measures that have hit private-sector workers hard in recent years. 
Perhaps, some workers suggested, the tough economic truths already known to so 
many on the outside finally are catching up with those who toil on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Federal employees have had it easy," said one who works in a regulatory 
agency that has yet to be threatened. "If anything, this may give federal 
employees a sense of what goes on every day elsewhere. Relative to a lot of 
other people out there, we've got it easy. There are always trade-offs. There 
was a clear mandate that people want a smaller government -- and that's the 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs are not the only things at stake. Programs are on the chopping block too. 
</P>
<P>
 At HUD, for example, Secretary Henry G. Cisneros has proposed combining 60 
programs into a few funding streams that would be awarded to states or cities 
in block grants. The recipients of funding would then be decided locally, at 
the discretion of individual states or cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see fewer people served," said Richard Nelson of the National Assn. of 
Housing and Redevelopment Officials, an advocacy group that works for 
affordable housing. "They'll try with smoke and mirrors to say that won't 
happen, but it will." 
</P>
<P>
 Also feeling a lot less secure are public-interest groups and other advocates, 
once comfortable in the knowledge that they could count on at least one 
Democratic stronghold in government to support traditional liberal social 
programs, whether it was the White House or Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just the new Republican majority they fear. They also are worried 
that they may no longer have an ally in Clinton. They are afraid that the 
President, who is increasingly moving toward the political center, may no 
longer be willing to stick up for some of their favorite programs. The coming 
battles are expected to take on a bipartisan theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not an ideological figure. I've worked for Republican presidents," said 
Edward Zigler, an architect of the Head Start program. "I just know a great 
deal about children and families. And when people start saying: 'Let's take a 
fresh look at Head Start,' that scares everybody to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Zigler, now director of the Yale University Bush Center in Child Development, 
said he plans to increase his presence in Washington, where "I will be talking 
to people on both sides of the aisle." 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago, representatives from only 30 to 40 groups were expected to 
show up at a meeting to discuss strategies to oppose the GOP anti-regulation 
agenda. Instead, the turnout was about three times the number anticipated -- 
120 groups representing a range of constituencies, including the disabled, the 
poor, the elderly and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great deal of concern about what's happening," said Gary Bass of 
OMB Watch, who attended the meeting. "Maybe one of the good things that can 
come out of this is that it will build solidarity in the public-interest 
community. We need to enliven civic participation. We've gotten fat and lazy in 
the last couple years."

FIASCO MAKES CHILDREN VICTIMS AGAIN; BANKRUPTCY: INJURY TRUST FUNDS THREATENED 
BY ORANGE COUNTY CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Patty Puglise says she remembers hearing a "little voice" that told her to ask 
more questions when the judge "strongly advised" her in 1992 to deposit her 
12-year-old son's $9,000 accident settlement in the Orange County investment 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge raved about the 8% return that the pool was paying. But money was 
something that Puglise, a single mother who is raising five teen-age children, 
had never taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Puglise relented and went along with the judge's recommendation. 
Today, she is angry and scared because Joseph is one of 435 minors who 
deposited $7 million in settlements in the county pool in the last two years, 
largely on assurances from the courts that the fund was solid. Like the other 
parents, Puglise wants to know if her son's trust fund has been wiped out in 
the county's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "How often does a county go bankrupt?" the Brea resident wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with a 2-year-old law that was sponsored by the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors and Orange County Superior Court, judges routinely recommended that 
minors deposit their settlements in the county investment pool rather than in 
federally insured accounts at a bank that paid substantially less interest. 
Most of the trust accounts were for out of court settlements in injury 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and guardians of the young accident victims said they agreed to 
deposit the money in the county pool because the judges assured them the county 
portfolio was a safe investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to say no to a judge. You can say no to a doctor and tell 
him you want a second opinion. You can't do this with a judge," said Barbara 
Arbour of Placentia, who said a judge intimidated her into depositing her 
daughter's $37,000 settlement in the county pool. "They have a very commanding 
appearance when they're sitting on the bench in their robes." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Tully H. Seymour, who is presiding over 
settlement cases involving minors, said that before the county's bankruptcy 
filing two weeks ago, "there was no reason for any of the judges in their 
wildest dreams to think that (former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron) 
was going to gamble with this money." 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour and the other judges said that they had no intention of pressuring 
anyone to invest in the county pool, which has lost more than $2 billion in 
value since its collapse, dragged under by high-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of anxious parents and lawyers complained that they received 
conflicting information or no information when they called Superior Court 
officials and the treasurer's office to inquire about the funds when the county 
filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Superior Court executive director Alan Slater said he received 
assurances from the county counsel and auditor-controller that the minors' 
trust accounts will be paid. But so far they are only verbal assurances, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I have that in writing? I don't. I wish I had," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Presiding Judge Jim Smith said he viewed concerns about the 
trust funds as "a tempest in a teapot." 
</P>
<P>
 "No disrespect for the significance of the issue. Until I find somebody who 
didn't receive a disbursement, then I know we have a problem," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith, Slater and other county officials said they did not know if 
payments are being made to trust fund owners who turn 18 or if anyone has 
requested a court order to transfer the settlement funds from the county pool 
to a private financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
 George Urch, spokesman for former Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), 
said Orange County's Board of Supervisors and Superior Court judges asked 
Umberg in 1991 to introduce legislation in Sacramento to allow minors to 
deposit settlement proceeds in the county treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was drafted by an Orange County legislative committee consisting 
of several administrators, including Citron. The bill was passed unanimously by 
both houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Orange County officials succeeded in changing the law, settlements 
received by minors had to be deposited strictly in federally insured blocked 
accounts -- inaccessible to parents or guardians -- or in annuities until the 
minors turned 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the law was changed, the Orange County Superior Court form that 
instructs parents where to deposit the funds specifically stated that the money 
must be deposited in a federally insured account, as required by court rules 
and state law. The words federally insured were written in bold type and 
underlined for emphasis on the form. 
</P>
<P>
 When the law was changed, the court added another option to the form. Parents 
were advised that they could also deposit the funds "with the county treasurer 
in an interest bearing trust fund." The new form does not warn parents that 
funds deposited with the treasurer are uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 An information sheet about the county pool given to parents and attorneys says 
that the county portfolio is not insured, but assures them that "deposits are 
secured by the continued stability of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, many parents and attorneys still assumed that minors' deposits 
were insured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone, including the attorneys, presumed that the funds were federally 
insured, as called for in the state Probate Code," said attorney Lawrence 
Eisenberg, past president of the Orange County Trial Lawyers Assn. "The court's 
own rules also specify that deposits have to be put in federally insured 
accounts." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge James Gray, who presided over settlement 
cases involving minors in 1993, said he and the other judges recommended the 
county pool because "the deposits were secured by the stability of the county." 
The county pool was another option legally available to minors, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge James A. Jackman, who presided over minors' settlement 
cases in 1992, said he did not hesitate to advise parents to deposit the 
settlements in the county pool because "at the time, Citron had been earning 
outstanding returns." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was no secret, from my standpoint, that I favored the pool. When they 
agreed to deposit the funds in the county treasury, frankly, I thought they 
were being pretty smart," Jackman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Seymour and Gray, Jackman said he had no reason to be concerned that the 
trust funds could be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Seymour, who has been presiding over the settlement calendar for most 
of this year, said he rarely recommended the fund after he failed to get any 
information about how the county portfolio was being administered. 
</P>
<P>
 When told that Arbour and other parents said they felt intimidated by judges' 
advice to deposit settlements in the county treasury, Jackman replied: "I hope 
I didn't pressure them." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to make information available to them," Gray said. "I didn't mean to 
intimidate anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Steve Archer, who represented Puglise's son, said the 
judges probably did not know that the county portfolio was stacked on risky 
investments. But he said the judges engaged in a conflict of interest when they 
handed down financial advice from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an obvious conflict of interest. The judges are in part employed by the 
county of Orange," Archer said. "They were saying, 'Put the money in an account 
controlled by my employer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the judges denied there was a conflict of interest. Technically, they 
are state employees, but Seymour acknowledged that more than 50% of the 
Superior Court's budget is county-funded, as is a portion of each Superior 
Court judge's pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the parents of Laura Small, the Lake Forest girl who was mauled by 
a mountain lion in Caspers Regional Park in 1986, filed a lawsuit Friday, 
alleging that $90,000 of Laura's $2-million settlement with the county over the 
mauling is trapped in the investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine attorney Frank Nunes, who filed a class-action lawsuit last week on 
behalf of minors and others whose trust funds are invested in the county pool, 
said that parents are getting the runaround from officials, including Superior 
Court employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "A parent applied to remove her child's money and transfer it to a bank," 
Nunes said. "One of the (court) clerks said she needed permission from the 
(county) treasurer's office to take the money out." 
</P>
<P>
 When the parent contacted the treasurer's office, she was told that the 
child's trust fund was frozen until the county counsel decides whether the 
minors' settlements are part of the investment pool, said Nunes. 
</P>
<P>
 A parent has to obtain a court order before transferring a minor's trust fund 
from the pool to a bank, Gray said. As of Friday, the judges said they had not 
received any requests to transfer funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The young accident victims who were required by state law to invest 
settlements in trust accounts are finding themselves victimized a second time 
by the county's financial crisis, their attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the money they got is now at risk," Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke Miller, whose son Ryan received $9,638 from an insurance company two 
years ago, said he "has no idea" what to tell his son when he asks about the 
trust fund in the county pool. Ryan, who is 14, hopes to use the money for 
college, said Miller, 37, of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to take the money out now and put it some place else," Miller said. "I 
assume the principal is protected because the note said it has to be returned 
on demand. But this remains to be seen. I don't know if he's lost the interest. 
I don't know anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton resident Mike Cummings said he, too, is worried about the $4,538 
settlement that his son, Robert, 14, deposited in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, what was I thinking when I took financial advice from a judge," Cummings 
said. "Unfortunately, we assumed that the judges had expertise that they didn't 
really have." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Cummings had written on the court's deposit form that he wanted 
Robert's settlement deposited at Pioneer Bank in Fullerton. However, after "a 
very persuasive sales pitch" by Gray, who was "a super salesman," he scratched 
out the bank's name and instead checked the box that said he preferred to put 
the funds in the county pool, Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin DeLeon, 12, of Huntington Beach has only $2,700 in the investment pool, 
but her guardian, Susan Byer, said she hoped that would have grown to $4,000 by 
the time Robin turned 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be enough to at least get started in college," said Byer. "Now, I 
have no idea what has happened to that money." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin, who wants to become a veterinarian, is optimistic that her trust fund, 
however small, is safe. "I'm sure I'll get it back," she said.

FRESNO'S WAR ON CRIME HEATS UP; POLICE: IN RESPONSE TO SURGE IN VIOLENCE, 
INCLUDING SNIPING AT PATROL CARS, SWAT TEAMS ARE RESPONDING TO GANG-CONTROLLED 
NEIGHBORHOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This may be the heart of the richest farm belt in the world, but it is a big 
city in every measure when it comes to crime. This weekend, hoping to blunt a 
winter of violence that has shocked even hardened observers, Fresno took an 
extraordinary step. 
</P>
<P>
 Robberies and shootings in certain poor neighborhoods will no longer be 
handled by regular officers. Instead, SWAT team members in full battle gear and 
armed with machine guns will confront gang members on turf that has become 
increasingly insular and deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 The military-like operation -- a direct response to several incidents of 
sniper fire directed at police this year -- will continue for the next five 
months and perhaps permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do everything the U.S. Constitution allows to get these guys 
off the streets," Sgt. Jose Moralez said. "Whatever action is needed we're 
going to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Using SWAT officers and police dogs to combat gang violence has been tried by 
a few cities, including Los Angeles, but not with the concentrated force 
outlined here, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 How it will play out, given the mixed results elsewhere, is not clear. Instead 
of a few officers responding to a high-priority call in violent neighborhoods, 
30 SWAT team members in gray camouflage fatigues and special vests will swoop 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Ed Winchester said the unit will enforce curfews, target homes 
where gang members are suspected of stockpiling weapons and detain anyone 
acting suspiciously. He emphasized that detentions and vehicle stops would be 
based on probable cause, not age or color. The National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People and other groups support the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The violence is the worst I've seen in my career," said Winchester, a 27-year 
veteran. "We've got to do something more. The community is demanding that we do 
something more." 
</P>
<P>
 As the tule fog descends every December in the San Joaquin Valley, turning a 
simple trip to the grocery store into a hazard, police expect fewer people on 
the streets and less violence. That has not been the case this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The fog that is so much of the lore in the valley is now insulation for 
14-year-olds taking potshots. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, an 11-year-old girl on her front lawn was shot five times at 
close range for no apparent reason by an unknown assailant. She was listed in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In a drive-by shooting a week earlier, an 8-year-old boy on a school break was 
shot in the head as he stood in the kitchen with his father. He too remains in 
critical condition. The boy's brother, a gang member, was the intended target. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 3, a 6-year-old girl was doing homework with her two brothers when a 
carload of men began shooting up her southwest neighborhood. When it was over, 
up to 50 bullets from five weapons had been fired, including several return 
rounds from gang members on the street. The girl was grazed in the back and one 
man was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 And twice this month in heavy fog, police responding to calls in 
gang-controlled neighborhoods have come under fire. In one incident, a bullet 
shattered the rear window of a patrol car. In the other, an officer was chasing 
a carload of gang members when a 14-year-old opened fire with a military-style 
assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, no officers were injured," Moralez said. "You can't believe the 
number of high-powered rifles and guns we've taken off the streets the past six 
months. Our patrol officers are outgunned." 
</P>
<P>
 A housing and strip mall boom has doubled Fresno's size and population to 
400,000 in recent years but failed to bring in enough tax revenues to hire 
enough patrolmen. As a result, this city has an officer-to-resident ratio of 
about 1 to 1,000, one of the worst in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Jim Patterson blames the inability to hire more officers on bloated 
wages and benefits paid to police and firefighters. Unions respond that 
uncontrolled growth -- requiring the city to spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars on sewers, water and roads -- is bankrupting Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a sort of truce, Patterson proposed to eliminate 50 city 
positions and freeze salaries in order to hire 40 new police officers and 10 
new firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city has 2,850 employees," he said. "To lay off 50 in the interest of 
public safety is not asking too much." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1982 to 1992, according to a recent state report, Fresno County had the 
largest increase in crime among the state's 15 counties with populations over 
500,000. The crime rate of 5,279 crimes for every 100,000 residents is higher 
than Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Sacramento and San 
Francisco. (Los Angeles had a crime rate of under 5,000 per 100,000 residents.) 
</P>
<P>
 "They murdered the ice cream man in my neighborhood today," Connie Wright 
wrote to the Fresno Bee last summer. "They murdered him while small children 
stood on curbsides in front of their homes and clutched their nickels and 
quarters in sweaty little summertime hands, waiting for 'Mr. Ice Cream Man.' 
They murdered him for $8." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the rise is blamed on Southeast Asian, Latino and black gangs that 
have taken over entire neighborhoods in southwest and southeast Fresno. The 
30-member paramilitary task force hopes to change the equation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the first night of the operation, a dozen patrol cars carrying team 
members raced from one gang haven to another. To safeguard against sniper fire, 
they split into two squads -- half the men assigned to an outer perimeter and 
half assigned to an inner one. 
</P>
<P>
 The cops were edgy. The air felt tense. Converging on a car in an alley with 
machine guns ready, they found a group of men drinking beer and enjoying a 
back-yard barbecue. "It's great to have you here," one frightened beer drinker 
said. "Keep up the good work." 
</P>
<P>
 They performed traffic stops and sealed off an entire neighborhood to take 
down a crack house. The most tense moment came about 1:30 a.m. when the team 
saw a Hmong refugee holding a shotgun. Later, after a Hmong interpreter was 
called, the team learned that the man had returned from a hunting trip.

ON CALIFORNIA: A SMALL QUESTION OF REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. What is the full impact of the financial crisis?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Not known at this time.  
</P>
<P>
 -- From an Associated Press question-answer overview of the Orange County 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 From high in a tower of glittering stone and glass, the attorney could gaze 
down upon that part of Orange County where the living is especially easy. This 
is that part of the county where a BMW is considered a sensible second car, 
where the jetliners cut back the engines on takeoff so as not to offend the 
swells living in houses by the sea -- where the principal industry seems to be 
investing money to make more money to invest again and make still more money. 
</P>
<P>
 The wind was up, sweeping the skies clean. In the distance, the sun played off 
the Pacific waters. The day before, Orange County had filed for bankruptcy, and 
the newspapers stacked on the attorney's conference table screamed of 
apocalypse and meltdown and bombshells. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure doesn't look bombed out to me," the attorney mused at the window. "Maybe 
a neutron bomb hit us -- the buildings are left standing, but the people are 
gone. I don't know. It still looks pretty good down there, doesn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 In this way, he addressed a question that has hung over the Orange County 
financial crisis from the start, that hangs over it still. The question is 
this: Is the collapse of the Orange County investment pool a real thing, or is 
it a government thing? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect everybody grasps the difference. A real thing hits you in the wallet 
or heart or over the head. It changes your life. A government thing is 
contained within the workings of government, its impact wildly overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 A robber sticks a pistol in your ear, that's a real thing. Congress passes a 
crime bill, that's a government thing. Only the most lightheaded romantics will 
swallow the political rhetoric that a crime bill will deter the robber from 
sticking a pistol in your ear. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance sheet spit out by your ATM, that's a real thing. The federal 
deficit is a government thing -- at least until the bill comes due for our 
children, or their children, or so on down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Two summers ago Sacramento failed to pass a budget on time. The state issued 
IOUs instead of cash, and everyone started screaming that California, the 
golden giant, had gone bust. Everyone was wrong. The government of California 
was in the ditch, not California itself. Did the IOUs touch your life in a real 
way? I didn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, every year local bureaucrats everywhere seek to protect their 
fiefdoms from budget-cutters by unleashing a stream of doomsday scenarios. They 
sound quite real. If the funds aren't restored, hospitals will be closed, 
murderers set free, corpses left to rot on freeways and so on. The funds are 
not restored, and yet, lo, there is still money enough for the hospitals, the 
jails and even to scrape up the daily road kill. And the citizens, having 
survived another doomsday, exhale as one and sigh: Ah, it was just one of those 
government things after all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With that background, what to make of the mess in Orange County? Real thing or 
government thing? The question has been asked, in varying forms, since the 
treasurer's investment tower first began to topple. So far, the official answer 
is nobody knows. The ship has blundered into uncharted waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, as government crises go, this one is a whopper. Heads will roll. 
The recall posse is saddling up, and so forth. It's been projected that some 
public schools won't be built on schedule. And maybe Michael Eisner won't be 
given a taxpayer-financed off-ramp for his expanded Magic Kingdom. A new 
highway is on hold, along with a fancy radio system the cops all want. And it's 
probably not a good time to apply for a county job. Still, none of these 
setbacks brings to mind the Oklahoma Dust Bowl or the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to remember that Orange County is not broke. The government of 
Orange County is broke, for now. Unlike Humpty Dumpty, however, governments 
possess a magical glue to put themselves back together. The glue is called "tax 
base," and here in Orange County it remains spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, after leaving the attorney's office, I drove over to South 
Coast Plaza, a sort of Holy Land for conspicuous consumers. It was packed with 
holiday shoppers. Were they buying fewer presents because some county treasurer 
had lost his shirt playing poker with the big boys from Wall Street? Get real.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BESIEGED COUNTY SEEKS TO PAY NONPROFIT GROUPS; 
BANKRUPTCY: EMERGENCY COUNCIL WILL BE ASKED TO RELEASE MONIES FOR SUCH SERVICES 
AS FOSTER CARE, COUNSELING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Orange County's bankruptcy management council convenes today, Supervisor 
William G. Steiner will propose that the county immediately pay private 
nonprofit groups $2.9 million to cover services provided before the county's 
bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 groups, who offer foster care for abandoned babies, court-ordered 
counseling and other community programs, are among the thousands of vendors 
owed money by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of (the agencies) have indicated that they can't make payroll, that they 
could be closing their doors next week," said Steiner, former director of 
Orange County's home for abused and neglected children. "I've been told if we 
get a go-ahead tomorrow then the agencies will have the checks within five days 
-- before Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner and the four other supervisors are scheduled to meet this morning to 
approve giving schools their shares of state money for education. Afterward, 
Steiner said, he will ask the new management council and the county's 
bankruptcy attorney, Bruce Bennett, to approve a separate payout for the 
nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The management council -- made up of Sheriff Brad Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael 
R. Capizzi and Health Services Agency Director Thomas Uram -- met with 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez to discuss ways to restructure county government, 
including expected cutbacks. The group plans to present a report to the 
supervisors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bennett disclosed that he has discovered discrepancies between internal 
records at former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's office and the 
county's trustee, Bank of America. It remains unclear whether funds were kept 
in separate accounts, earning different returns, as some investors were told, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Auditor Kurt Sjoberg -- whose staff is reviewing the Orange County 
books at the request of Gov. Pete Wilson -- said regulators should clamp down 
on public agencies to ensure better disclosure of risks and prevent cities and 
schools from borrowing to invest, as several in Orange County did. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas W. Hayes, the former state treasurer who is acting as the county's 
chief financial adviser, spent the weekend in Sacramento preparing to testify 
Monday before a special state Senate committee on local investment practices 
that was convened in the aftermath of the Orange County bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett spent Saturday working at his Los Angeles office, away from the "war 
room" at the Hall of Administration in Santa Ana where he has spent most of the 
past two weeks since Orange County became the largest local government in U.S. 
history to file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said he has discovered conflicting records about whether Citron 
-- who resigned two weeks ago -- kept segregated accounts for some of the 187 
cities, schools and other agencies that had money in the county's investment 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors said Citron told them there was a "bond pool" separate from the 
commingled county investment pool, and that Citron sent them lists showing 
different interest rates for each pool. But Bennett said there is no 
documentation of separate accounts at the Bank of America, the county's trustee 
for the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the best of our knowledge, so far, there was no actual segregation of any 
securities," he said. "Internally, we have found some documents that at least 
in the treasurer's mind, some positions were held for particular districts or 
agencies. He had internal documents indicating that he was thinking of things 
in terms of separate accounts, but he didn't in fact establish separate 
accounts." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said he and the county's financial advisers from Salomon Bros. are 
still poring through records in hopes of unraveling the discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kenan, director of finance at the Orange County Transportation Authority, 
said he had believed the agency had $540 million in the bond pool, and $560 
million in the higher-risk, higher-interest co-mingled pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is the largest investor in the pool, which has plunged at least $2 
billion in value -- or about 27% -- this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just shocked," Kenan said. "Legally there should have been two pools. I 
don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview from his Northern California home Saturday, Sjoberg added his 
voice to the chorus of state officials who are appalled that some cities and 
school districts borrowed huge sums for the sole purpose of investing in the 
pool. "That's risky business to say the least," Sjoberg said. "I think that's 
pretty unwise." 
</P>
<P>
 A five-member team from Sjoberg's office spent the past week in Orange County 
and will return Monday to continue their independent assessment of the 
situation. Sjoberg said he expected a report later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 For many key players in the ongoing fiscal fiasco, Saturday was their first 
day off in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us are meeting and have met 16 or 18 hours a day on these things, and 
it's nice to have a breather today," said Irvine City Manager Paul Brady, who 
is representing the county's 31 cities on a committee of creditors. "We can't 
keep up this pace for 15 or 20 days at a time, people are going to get real 
burned out, and possibly ill." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Thomas Riley and Steiner also said they were relaxing at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm baby-sitting my grandchildren, which is a lot better duty than I've 
experienced the last two months,"' Steiner said. "Ah, two weeks," he quickly 
corrected himself. "It just feels like two months." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder spent the afternoon in Rossmoor, where a 
renovated community center was being named in her honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, 30 people enveloped her with support while a lone protester, picketed 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make everybody happy," Wieder said. "I'm just sorry, at this time 
of year, that people can be such grinches."

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FACE DEPORTATION COSTS IN GERMANY; EUROPE: OFFICIALS OF 
STATES INVOLVED SAY FEES ARE JUSTIFIED. RIGHTS WORKERS CALL PAYMENTS 
'EXPLOITATION.' 
</P>

 An evening in the slammer is no night at the Ritz. But for the $64 to $84 per 
night that some German states want to collect from refugees awaiting 
deportation, it might at least be a Ramada Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget credit cards -- many of these deportees have no cash even -- but a good 
watch, video camera or VCR will do in some cases in which prison officials have 
orders to seize valuables from those who cannot pay the jail bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last couple months, several of Germany's 16 states have begun charging 
illegal immigrants for the costs of their deportation, including jail stays. 
</P>
<P>
 And the "room" rates run high: about $84 per night in Baden-Wurttemberg, $64 
in Bavaria -- and $77 in Lower Saxony, until press reports embarrassed that 
Social Democratic state government into canceling the daily charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice, legal under Germany's foreigners law and a federal asylum 
statute passed last year, is still more an exception than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Many states, such as North Rhine-Westphalia, do not charge, and most refugees 
cannot pay. Officials in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg said they actually have 
collected money or goods in only about 5% to 10% of deportation cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But refugee and human rights workers are questioning the taking of any money 
from immigrants, especially those who have lost in the legal asylum process and 
must make a new start back home. "It is double exploitation," said Kai Weber of 
the private Refugees Council in Lower Saxony. "First they are exploited as 
cheap workers, and afterward the money they have earned under hard conditions 
is taken away from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Teloeken, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees in Bonn, said international conventions do not cover the issue of 
charging refugees fees. "Legally, this is possible under German law. The 
question is whether it is appropriate," Teloeken said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in states that charge deportees insist it is. "Deportation is the 
responsibility of the person affected," said Hesse Interior Ministry spokesman 
Gerd-Uwe Mende. "They are here illegally and, therefore, they must pay the 
consequences if they are deported." 
</P>
<P>
 That is in principle. In fact, Mende conceded, "I cannot take money from 
someone who has none." 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, deportations of foreign criminals and illegal immigrants 
who do not leave voluntarily are the responsibility of the federal government, 
which pays for all costs of detaining and returning them to their countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost of detaining an illegal immigrant for deportation from the 
United States is about $39 per day, according to Michael Manuel, a spokesman 
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington. The U.S. 
government deported 37,003 people in 1993 and has deported 38,725 so far this 
year. The budget for the 1994 deportation program is $385 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Such figures are harder to come by in Germany. Although asylum and 
deportations are governed by federal law, the responsibility for support of 
asylum-seekers and deportations of those who have been denied rests with the 
state and, in some states, with the community. 
</P>
<P>
 An asylum study group, Arbeitskreis Asyl, says that 36,000 people were 
deported from Germany in 1993. The federal Interior Ministry says it has no 
nationwide deportation figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in the United States, people requesting political asylum in Germany 
receive government assistance in the form of housing, food, clothing and 
medical care while awaiting a decision on their cases. The cost is about 
$10,000 per person per year for an estimated 1 million to 1.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, the refugees' movement is restricted -- they must remain in the 
county where they are placed -- and the government can find them easily in the 
event they are denied asylum. If they do not agree to leave voluntarily, or if 
the government fears they will "disappear," they are jailed for anywhere from 
several days to six weeks, then charged and deported. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the thousands of people awaiting deportation at any one time -- 600 in 
North Rhine-Westphalia alone -- are Vietnamese, Algerians and citizens of the 
former Yugoslav federation who have no papers and have difficulty getting any 
from governments resisting taking back their refugees. Some of these people may 
remain in jail for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Others awaiting deportation include illegal immigrants who got caught by 
police checking documents or were arrested, and asylum-seekers rounded up after 
losing their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavarian Interior Ministry spokesman Christoph Hillenbrand defended the 
practice of charging for detention, administration of deportations and flights 
home, saying that federal law "obliges" states to ask for payment for 
repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often you can't get this money, but sometimes they have luxury goods and 
sometimes cash. Maybe in 5% of all cases, you can get a certain sum. Sometimes 
they'll surprise you and have a big Rolex or a thousand marks ($635) or a video 
player," Hillenbrand said. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Bavaria do with the goods? "We try to sell them. It's not 
Christie's, but there are other ways to sell in an auction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That states had begun charging deportees was virtually unknown until the 
Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper reported it in Lower Saxony last month. 
Following the story, authorities in Hanover confirmed at a news conference that 
they were charging deportees a daily rate and confiscating valuables from those 
who could not pay. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the national weekly magazine Focus reported the story, state 
officials began denying the practice -- even as the state's Social Democratic 
prime minister, Gerhard Schroeder, announced he would put a stop to it.

MANDELA ADMITS SLOWNESS OF REFORM, WARNS OF HASTE; SOUTH AFRICA: ALTHOUGH HE 
VOWS TO PROVIDE 'VISIBLE CHANGE,' OTHERS SAY PRESIDENT IS 'WALKING A 
TIGHTROPE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The message was simple, and the setting supreme, for a guerrilla group turned 
democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the birthplace of the African National Congress, in a province that 
remains a stronghold of right-wing whites, President Nelson Mandela warned 
Saturday that his new government must provide "visible change" to improve 
people's lives next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "For, proud as we should be of the achievements made, the reality is that 
democratic forces in our country have captured only elements of political 
power," Mandela told the first ANC national conference since sweeping free 
elections nearly eight months ago. "South Africa is not yet out of the woods." 
</P>
<P>
 Social change is too slow in coming, Mandela said, and new legislation to 
redress the wrongs of apartheid is taking "longer than the situation demanded." 
</P>
<P>
 He warned that the democratic revolution that ended statutory white supremacy 
is not over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to contend with rear-guard resistance from the parties of apartheid 
and white privilege, from influential elements within the civil service and the 
security Establishment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Destabilizing agents are still present in "the ANC and the rest of the 
democratic movement, universities, the media and other institutions," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela also criticized the ANC, however, for the confusion that followed the 
election and the initial creation of democratic government structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were disorganized and behaved in a manner that could have endangered the 
revolution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's 75-minute keynote address drew raucous cheers, chants and songs from 
the 2,800 delegates in a hall at the University of the Orange Free State. 
Whether his promise for concrete change is more than rhetoric, however, remains 
to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The slow pace of the government's ambitious five-year reconstruction and 
development program has less to do with political directives than the sobering 
reality of trying to transform a nation saddled with 50% black unemployment and 
appalling inequalities in land, health care, education and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is rising resentment from the mostly black ANC members, who argue 
that Mandela's fervent appeals for reconciliation with whites since the April 
election have blinded him to the immediate needs of disadvantaged blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a sense of impatience from the grass-roots level that delivery (of 
tangible improvements) is not taking place fast enough," ANC spokesman Carl 
Niehaus said. "The message is we are overly concerned with the white 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 But Niehaus said the ANC will not change its current economic or social 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effect of moving too fast will be worse than moving too slow. The 
government is sticking to its guns on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, at least, there has been little evidence that public discontent or 
disillusionment have threatened Mandela's remarkable popularity or the national 
consensus behind his leadership of a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
 Political violence has fallen sharply. Labor unrest, an unsettling mutiny by 
former ANC guerrillas, small-scale land invasions by urban squatters, 
continuing township rent boycotts and other problems have proved to be teething 
problems for the new democracy, rather than major crises. And growing criticism 
of several lackluster Cabinet ministers has yet to rub off on Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 A nationwide poll released last week, for example, showed his popularity not 
only remains astronomically high among blacks but has now risen substantially 
among whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Support has fallen sharply, the poll found, for the once-mighty National Party 
headed by former President Frederik W. de Klerk, who has largely disappeared 
from public view in his role as deputy president under Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 But delegates said Mandela still faces a difficult challenge in the months 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is walking a tightrope now," said Phakamisa Siyongwana, a 27-year-old 
delegate from Kwamagxaki in the Eastern Cape. "On the one side is the right 
wing. And on the other, the people's needs are urgent." 
</P>
<P>
 Grantham Steenkamp, a delegate from Hopetown in the Northern Cape, warned that 
people's "patience is wearing thin." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them what we need is time," he said. "The apartheid government ruled 
for 40 years. The new government is ruling just seven months. Give us time." 
</P>
<P>
 But another delegate, Marics Masoetsa, said time is running out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people are feeling neglected and say they are being ignored by the 
people they put in power," he said. "They say the changes are too slow, and the 
leaders are too lenient with the whites who are resisting." 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference in Johannesburg last week to launch his new 
autobiography, "A Long Walk to Freedom," Mandela justified his attempts to 
assuage white fears to stem flight of capital and to avoid a violent backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand the criticism that we were paying attention to the whites," he 
said. "These people do not understand that the transition from white domination 
to democracy did not happen easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a "clear danger of civil war," he said, "We had to tell the whites, 
'You have nothing to fear from an ANC government.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After taking office in May, the government mandated a series of high-profile 
but relatively easy reforms, including feeding programs for schoolchildren, 
free medical care for pregnant women and free education for children starting 
school next year. Under a new land restoration law, blacks have begun to 
reclaim and resettle land seized under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 But in two recent visits to bleak squatter shantytowns, Mandela publicly 
acknowledged that he has yet to deliver the housing, jobs, water projects and 
other tangible benefits promised during the election campaign. The cheering 
crowds appeared not to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-day ANC conference, which has the theme "From Resistance to 
Reconstruction and Nation Building," will focus on internal party matters and 
broad tactics and policies for the next three years. Most of the meetings are 
behind closed doors, and most major decisions have already been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegates will elect a six-member national executive committee Monday. Few 
surprises are likely. Mandela is certain to be reelected ANC president, and 
Thabo Mbeki will be reelected deputy president. Mbeki is Mandela's second in 
command in government and his heir apparent for the 1997 elections.

spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Zubair Chattha said the Pakistani was being treated in the U.N.

<P>
 An aid worker with the French charity International Action Against Hunger was

<P>
 The gunmen, believed to be former employees of the agency, were demanding a 
ransom for his release, the spokesman said, but gave no further details. 
</P>
<P>
 Acts of lawlessness have increased throughout the country. The United Nations 
has reduced its peacekeeping force in readiness for a complete pullout in

4 SOUTH AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SIGN AGREEMENT CREATING NEW TRADE BLOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four presidents signed a trade agreement here Saturday that unites the 
countries along South America's eastern coast from the steamy Amazon jungle to 
the frosty south. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercosur trade bloc of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay will have a 
population of 200 million people and a combined economic output of $750 billion 
a year.The agreement takes effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our predecessors always dreamed of a united America," said Argentine 
President Carlos Menem. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement cancels tariffs on 9,000 products traded among the four 
countries. About 85% of the tariffs will drop to zero on Jan. 1, while 
telecommunications and other technical products will keep tariffs for the next 
five to 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade among the four countries reached $12 billion this year, up from $2.7 
billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the trade bloc -- known as Mercosur in Spanish and Mercosul in 
Portuguese -- also will charge standard tariffs on imports from outside the 
trade bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy will be the Mercosur coordinator for 
the next six months. He said he will try to recruit all of the other South 
American nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Chile and Bolivia also attended the proceedings as 
observers. Chile's president, Eduardo Frei, has said that negotiations to enter 
Mercosur are his "No. 1 priority."

IN CHECHEN CAPITAL, MOOD IS WARLIKE; RUSSIA: THE REPUBLIC HAS BEEN CHAFING 
UNDER MOSCOW'S RULE FOR TWO CENTURIES. PEOPLE NOW EXPRESS A MIXTURE OF 
RESIGNATION AND WRATH.

<P>
 At the open-air arms market on Peace Prospekt, everybody was buying and nobody 
was selling on Saturday. At best, you could barter bullets for a spotless white 
flak jacket from a war merchant named Kutuz. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the children had fled this rebel capital for the countryside -- but 
not Rezuan Bugayev. The pint-size 11-year-old, sporting the green silk bandanna 
of a suicide soldier, danced in the city's central square amid a circle of 
beaming elders wearing cylindrical sheepskin hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Deputy Trade Minister Zoya Baidulayeva, mother of nine children, was 
boarding a bus with dozens of other women to go face down Russian soldiers near 
the town of Osinovka. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll have to go over our dead bodies if they want to touch our men!" she 
vowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechnya, the secessionist republic now flooded by thousands of Russian 
troops, was getting into the stubborn, half-crazy mood for war. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 A mountainous, oil-rich land known for its ruthless gangsters, Chechnya has 
battled Moscow's rule since the 18th Century. Its latest bid for independence 
came in 1991, when President Dzhokar M. Dudayev, a former Soviet air force 
general who sports a fedora and a roguish mustache, declared the small 
republic's independence. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Kremlin's latest attempt to control it was due today, after the latest 
deadline for Dudayev to give up his armed resistance to Moscow's rule passed at 
midnight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 With a cool-hot mix of resignation and unquenchable anger, the Chechens 
prepared for an upsurge of Russian attacks, possibly including a siege of 
Grozny, a city whose peacetime population of 400,000 has shrunk by half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to live peacefully," said Kutuz, the arms dealer, summing up the 
Chechen mood. "But if they don't leave us alone, we'll destroy everything." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just leave us alone" is the refrain repeated by nearly everyone, from nurses 
in Grozny's undersupplied military hospital to the inhabitants of the city's 
equivalent of a millionaires' row. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can kill us, but you can't conquer us," said Sultan Khajiev, a 
businessman who refused to name his business. He is a resident of the Grozny 
counterpart of Beverly Hills, nicknamed Air Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Air refers to the thin air out of which Chechen business people are known for 
making their money. 
</P>
<P>
 Grozny was the base for the greatest bank fraud in Russian history, as well as 
several plane and bus hijackings. The Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs that cruise the 
city's streets bespeak the breadth of the shadow Chechen economy. 
</P>
<P>
 So does a house like Khajiev's, a red brick monster the size of a small 
mansion, the likes of which one might find on the bluffs of Pacific Palisades. 
But the side of mutton hanging from the roof pole might set it apart, and 
Khajiev, stubbly and decked in a sweater bearing the words Country Club , is 
Chechen through and through. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russians won't come in here," he said. "They will come in only over our 
corpses." 
</P>
<P>
 Khajiev said he had donated up to 25% of his income -- the amount was 
unspecified -- to support Dudayev and Chechnya's defense, including milk, meat, 
bread, medicine and arms. His seven brothers, all involved in the unnamed 
family business, have also helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've evacuated our children so our hands won't be tied," he said. "So we're 
free to fight and die." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Russian version of Chechnya's motive for demanding 
independence, evasive business people like Khajiev are intent on keeping the 
republic a police-free zone so they can continue to run arms, drugs and 
financial scams. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechens tell it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 On a central corner of Grozny stands a crowded cemetery packed with broken 
gravestones, a clue to the source of the deep pain of the past that fuels the 
Chechens' anger. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1944, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin decided that the Chechens, because of 
the long enmity with the Russians who had colonized them, could not be trusted 
to defend the motherland against the Nazis. Historians estimate that 800,000 
Chechens were stuffed into rail cars and deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia, 
and 240,000 of them died en route. 
</P>
<P>
 "In '44, they came in as if with a broom, and they swept us out and half the 
nation died -- for nothing," said Lech Akayev, a former colonel in the Soviet 
army and now head of Grozny's sole military hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowded cemetery is covered with Chechen gravestones that were used to 
pave Grozny's streets after the Chechens were deported. Only last year were the 
stones ripped up and put back where they came from. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, when the Kremlin tells the Chechens that they must disarm or that they 
should evacuate their families to Russia, out of harm's way, it is met only 
with deep distrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the gray cold damp and spitting snow Saturday, the young militants who 
strolled nonchalantly across Freedom Square with Stinger missiles slung over 
their shoulders seemed to feel nothing but their burning urge for battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll fight to the last Chechen," declared Said Turayev, a welder, his eyes 
bloodshot, his vest packed with seven grenades and hung with six clips of 
bullets. The traditional Chechen dagger, marked with distinctive curlicues, had 
the place of honor in his breast pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a storm, we'll fight," he said. "Allah is with us." 
</P>
<P>
 For all their bravado, the Chechens would need more than faith to see them 
through the firepower that was expected to hit them this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The military hospital had no blood in its blood bank. And even though the 
capital boasts burned-out Russian tanks left over from an attempted seizure of 
Grozny on Nov. 26, it showed few signs of organized defense aside from a couple 
of barricades near Dudayev's presidential headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 One hopeful poster on Freedom Square proclaimed, "We'll set our quality 
against the Russian quantity." But estimates put Dudayev's forces at fewer than 
10,000, with virtually no air power and little armor. 
</P>
<P>
 As reports mounted that Moscow planned to bomb Grozny, some residents remained 
optimistic -- like Hassan Agayev, a historian who works in the frigid halls of 
Dudayev's unheated headquarters, coordinating efforts there with those in the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia cannot afford great losses among its own soldiers," Agayev said. "They 
don't care about the Chechens, but they would have great losses here." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Kremlin must understand, he said, that "if troops come in here, it 
will be Palestine. It will be a constant war, a prolonged war." 
</P>
<P>
 But along with the optimists, many of Grozny's stoic, apprehensive residents 
are simply people with no escape, including ethnic Russians caught in a 
political battle within their own country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no money and nowhere to go," said Tatiana Kopylova, a nurse at the 
military hospital. "Everyone wants peace, they want the war to end, they want 
the presidents to sit down and talk, because it's the women and children who 
suffer."

SMALL STEPS LED UP TO BIG-TIME ADDICTION

 Nancy Flores' tumble into crack was so simple and seamless. She dabbled in 
glue sniffing at age 12, grass and angel dust as a teen-ager.Curiosity drew her 
to the odd concoction some friends cooked up in the kitchen and began smoking 
in a glass pipe. Taking hold of the tiny tube broke her grip on life. "I hit 
that stuff and I took off," she says. "I fell in love." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a long, ugly affair for her children. They bounced among friends, 
relatives and foster care, frequently supported by taxpayers. Once she 
persuaded a social worker to let her keep her newborn at home. But while 
smoking crack days later, she mistakenly poured rubbing alcohol into the 
infant's mouth, thinking it was a milk bottle. "I was trying to give her 
something to shut her up so I can hit the pipe," Flores said. Another child was 
born with two small knife wounds in her back, inflicted when the pregnant 
Flores was attacked by a knife-swinging drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final throes of her addiction, violence took her down, landing her 
repeatedly in the hospital at public expense. First, a man cut her head open 
with a machete. Then an angry friend threw a tire iron at her, puncturing her 
lung. Later, high on crack, she was hit by a car. "Death kept knockin' me in 
the face," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She turned to treatment last year and says she is clean. Two of her children 
are back and she is getting counseling and job training help through SHIELDS 
for Families. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband recently delivered a son. It was her sixth pregnancy -- 
but the first she experienced drug-free. RICH CONNELL

WEALTH PAVED PATH TO CRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Mitchell's path to crack addiction -- and his publicly funded recovery -- 
ran not through poverty and the inner city, but through wealth and the business 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1970s, Mitchell lived in Laguna Beach, where he and a partner 
built a successful clothing business.Flush with money, he grew to love powder 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he was spending so much on coke, Mitchell, 46, lost his business. He 
held a succession of jobs and eventually quit drugs in the late 1980s through a 
group recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 6 1/2 years of being clean, he caved in. In 1992, feeling lonely and 
troubled, he took his first hit of crack. "It was extremely euphoric," he said. 
"It brought back a high I had not felt for six years." Although he pulled back 
after a three-week binge, the friend who had offered that first hit returned 
earlier this year. That led to months of usage that took Mitchell to Hollywood, 
MacArthur Park and Skid Row, where crack is plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 As he began to lose everything again, friends and relatives persuaded him to 
enter a live-in treatment program. When his brother dropped him off, Mitchell 
headed to the facility's restroom, where he took one last hit before checking 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 He was terrified. "It's like this is (it)," he said after being admitted. "I 
don't have any more chances." 
</P>
<P>
 But after less than two weeks of detoxification, Mitchell was feeling 
confident and has moved to a longer-term residential program paid for by the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I've been clean and sober, (I've) been able to help people," he said. "I 
think I can do that again." RICH CONNELL

GOP CONTRACT A REVERSAL OF DECADES-OLD FEDERAL POLICIES; POLITICS: DEEP CUTS IN 
SOCIAL PROGRAMS TO OFFSET TAX REDUCTIONS WOULD HELP UPPER-INCOME AMERICANS 
MOST. BALANCED-BUDGET AMENDMENT ALSO PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Republican strategy for overhauling the federal government represents an 
attempt to bring to a screeching halt 60 years of Washington policies designed 
to redistribute wealth from the most affluent in American society to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 That agenda, spelled out most clearly in the House GOP's "contract with 
America," calls for deep cuts in welfare and other poverty programs to help pay 
for tax cuts that most directly help upper-income Americans. It would repeal 
President Clinton's policy of forcing rich Americans to pay for a greater share 
of the government's costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-point contract, the conservative Republican blueprint for action by the 
new, GOP-controlled Congress during its first 100 days in session next year, 
would also try to amend the Constitution to require a balanced federal budget 
as soon as the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing the budget would presumably force further deep cuts in most other 
federal programs that benefit the poor and the middle class, except Social 
Security, which would be specifically exempt. The spending cuts would have to 
grow each year to offset the tax cuts unless the tax cuts act as a spur to 
economic growth and actually enhance federal revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican leaders talk forthrightly about the importance of reversing 
generations-old federal policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The function of the federal government is to create opportunity, not 
redistribute income," said incoming House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas. 
"What we are advocating is not a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, 
but policies that allow people to keep their own wealth, to reverse the 
redistribution that has been going on for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.), the next chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, which writes tax legislation and has jurisdiction over many welfare 
programs, said: "We've got to find a way to help people to help themselves 
rather than redistributing wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the rest of the House Republican leadership, Archer is committed to 
slashing outlays for food stamps, Aid to Families With Dependent Children and 
other federal programs that are targeted at people with low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The "contract with America" would deny AFDC benefits to about half of the 
families that now receive it. Over five years the Republican proposal would 
slash at least $40 billion from welfare and related programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the contract would provide a wide array of tax breaks that 
would leave the tax burden on the wealthiest Americans at its lowest levels in 
at least a decade. Altogether, Republicans say, their provisions lowering taxes 
on upper-income Americans, affluent retirees and businesses would cost about 
$40 billion over five years -- roughly the same amount by which they plan to 
cut welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, leading Republicans see the contract as just a down payment on 
their long-range goal of extracting the government from the role of fiscal 
Robin Hood, taxing the rich and showering benefits on the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Republican contract is enacted, the level of redistribution that goes 
on through the government is going to be dramatically reduced," said Daniel 
Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank with 
close ties to the incoming Republican leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 While hard numbers are not yet available on the cumulative impact of the 
Republican contract, Mitchell estimates that it could cut the redistributive 
effects of current government policies by about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not redistribution of income from the poor to the rich and middle class, 
it's stopping the redistribution of income from the rich and middle class to 
the poor," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 From the bottom of the income ladder, the prospect of the Republican 
revolution is chilling, especially because the gap between the rich and the 
poor has already widened significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The private economy has set the tone, with highly skilled workers commanding 
ever higher salaries at the same time that employers are able to hold back the 
wages of low-skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, the poorest 20% of the nation captured only 3.6% of 
the national income, the lowest level since the Great Society programs were 
launched in the mid-1960s. The richest 20% received 48.2% of the nation's 
income. More than 39 million Americans are now living below the poverty line, 
including more children than at any time since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, inflation has taken a healthy bite out of federal benefits for the 
poor. The value of the average monthly AFDC benefit per family, adjusted for 
inflation, has declined 45% since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics believe that the Republicans have significantly underestimated the 
severity of the welfare cuts in their contract. While Republicans estimate 
their changes would save $40 billion over five years, for example, the liberal 
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities believes that they would lead to 
reductions of $57 billion over four years. The center says the plan would 
remove the safety net from under 2.5 million families and 5 million children -- 
and have twice the impact of President Ronald Reagan's welfare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings would come largely by making legal non-citizen immigrants 
ineligible for scores of benefits, combining nutrition programs into a single 
block grant to states and capping their growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP proposal also slaps a spending ceiling on other programs, including 
AFDC, supplemental security income for the elderly and disabled, low-income 
housing programs and child-care subsidies for the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Full food stamp, SSI and AFDC benefits would no longer be guaranteed to 
everyone eligible. If people qualified for more benefits in any year than 
Congress had allocated, benefit levels would be reduced or some otherwise 
eligible people would be denied benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "These programs are on autopilot," said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.), the 
incoming chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee with jurisdiction over 
welfare reform. "Congress should be more responsible to the taxpayer for what 
we do with their money." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican architects say their plan will save families by liberating the poor 
from a deadening dependence on federal handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking welfare away as a way of life, some people are going to get hurt, but 
the vast masses are going to be helped through the self-empowerment that we 
intend to force on them," Shaw said. "Welfare is no longer going to be 
tolerated. It's bad for the recipients, and it's bad for taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically a repudiation of the welfare state," said Steve Moore, a 
senior analyst at the conservative Washington-based Cato Institute. "This is 
the tough-love approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Republican formula reflects the growing consensus among 
middle-class Americans that the nation can no longer afford its traditional 
welfare programs, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government's role in redistributing income grew steadily after 
World War II as Americans enjoyed an unprecedented leap in incomes and living 
standards. But now, as living standards are growing more slowly, middle-class 
taxpayers increasingly resent welfare -- and in the November elections showed 
their support for a smaller government role in fighting poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is not surprising that senior Clinton Administration officials now argue 
that the contract represents a Republican effort to play on middle-class 
anxieties by blaming poverty programs for the nation's ills. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is missing from the Republican contract is a reality test: Cutting 
welfare will not address the economic problems facing the working poor or the 
stagnation of wages of middle-class Americans," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, 
chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers. "It is a dangerous prescription 
to blame the poor for the problems of the working and middle class." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to the Republicans who have captured control of Congress, the contract 
holds out the promise of igniting a burst of private economic activity and job 
growth that ultimately will benefit everyone, including the poor. It is a 
free-market agenda that takes the supply-side tax-cutting theories of 
Reaganomics and couples them with the deep spending cuts in domestic programs 
that Reagan never achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the contract are tax cuts that Republicans believe will 
unleash the resources of the most affluent Americans to save, invest and create 
millions of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The cornerstone is the Republicans' long-cherished proposal for cutting in 
half the tax rate on capital gains -- the profits realized from the sale of 
investments -- and indexing future gains so that taxes are not levied on 
inflation-driven gains. In addition, taxpayers could deduct losses on home 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of those changes would make about three-quarters of all capital 
gains tax-exempt. Republicans estimate that their capital-gains break would 
cost $56 billion over five years, and the congressional Joint Tax Committee has 
found that more than 70% of the benefits would flow to those who earn over 
$200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract also calls for making upper-income taxpayers eligible for 
individual retirement accounts, scrapping the higher tax rate on Social 
Security benefits for affluent retirees, repealing the so-called marriage 
penalty for two-income couples, increasing the amount of estates and gifts that 
are excluded from federal taxes and changing the way small businesses write off 
their investments. Most of the benefits would flow to relatively affluent 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the largest tax break proposed is a $500-per-child tax credit for 
families. At a cost of $107 billion over five years, it is the key element in 
the Republican effort to win the middle class over to its agenda. The 
Republican proposal does not limit the break to the middle class; families with 
annual incomes up to $200,000 would be fully eligible, although poor families 
with no income tax liabilities would receive no benefit. 'Contract With 
America'

CLINTON AIRS APPEAL FOR TAX CUTS; BUDGET: IN WEEKLY RADIO ADDRESS, THE 
PRESIDENT WARNS OF A GROWING EDUCATION GAP IN SOCIETY. HE TOUTS HIS 
'MIDDLE-CLASS BILL OF RIGHTS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unless the nation gives all of its people a chance for higher education, the 
United States risks becoming a two-tiered society with an elite few reaping the 
rewards, President Clinton said Saturday, giving a push to his plan to cut 
taxes for the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people are being priced out of a fair shot at high-quality 
education," Clinton said in his weekly radio address, broadcast from Northern 
Virginia Community College in suburban Annandale. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said a key element of his plan, which he calls the "middle-class 
bill of rights," will make college tuitions tax deductible up to $10,000 a year 
for families making up to $120,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing like this has ever been done before," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He announced the tax-cutting plan in a televised speech Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 While education after high school is more important than ever, it is also more 
expensive than ever, Clinton said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't change that, we're at risk of losing our great American middle 
class, and of becoming a two-tiered society with a few successful people at the 
top and everyone else struggling below," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also touted the other parts of the proposal, including a tax credit of up 
to $500 for most children younger than 13, enhanced individual retirement 
accounts and a program to channel job-training money directly to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we have to pay for all this," Clinton said, sketching his proposal 
to cut back the programs and activities of three Cabinet departments and extend 
a spending freeze on the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he and Vice President Al Gore would outline the cuts in more 
detail Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton shared the microphone with Education Secretary Richard W. Riley, who 
said the President has produced "the most far-reaching education agenda of any 
President in a generation." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to invest in our future and that future is our children," he said. 
"And the President's proposal takes us forward toward that goal." 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP response to the address, Rep.-elect Steve LaTourette of Ohio said 
Republicans can support Clinton's proposal to make tuition deductible but that 
the President's tax cut proposals are only a start in reducing the tax burden 
and the size of government. 
</P>
<P>
 LaTourette criticized Clinton's plan for omitting spouses who stay home with 
children from IRA benefits and for excluding the $500 deduction for children 
age 13 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "With four children of my own, I know all too well the cost of raising kids 
only goes up as they get older," LaTourette said.

LATER HIGHER COSTS SEEN IN RIVAL TAX PLANS; BUDGET: ANALYSIS FINDS TREND COULD 
WORSEN FEDERAL DEFICIT IN YEARS AHEAD. SAYS CLINTON PLAN COULD COST $173 
BILLION IN A DECADE, GOP PLAN $712 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The costs of the major tax plans offered by President Clinton and Republican 
congressional leaders would increase sharply after five years, according to an 
analysis issued Saturday by the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 That trend could, in turn, threaten to worsen the federal budget deficit by 
the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 In its official estimate of the costs of both Clinton's new middle-class 
tax-cut package and the broad menu of tax cuts included in the House 
Republicans' "contract with America," the Treasury Department said the 
Republican plan would cost four times as much as the Clinton plan over 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Department analysts said the Clinton proposal would cost $59.9 billion over 
five years and a cumulative $173.6 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that the costs in the second five years of the proposal would be 
$113 billion -- roughly double the costs in the first five, Treasury officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Treasury analysts warned that the costs of the Republican plan, which 
includes a wide array of tax cuts for the middle class, the affluent and for 
businesses and investors, would be $712 billion over 10 years -- quadruple the 
costs of the Clinton plan over a comparable period. 
</P>
<P>
 Over five years, the GOP contract would cost $197.2 billion, the department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury estimates for the GOP contract are far higher than the figures 
released by House Republican leaders. The Republican staff of the House Budget 
Committee said the GOP package would cost $147.9 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury Department is responsible for issuing the executive branch's 
official estimates of the costs of tax and revenue proposals. The Joint Tax 
Committee, Congress' official arbiter of the costs of tax plans, has not yet 
issued its own estimates of either the Republican contract or the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury officials said the costs of the Republican contract would balloon in 
the second five years, largely because many of its tax provisions are 
"back-loaded" to provide most of the benefits later. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most budget policies are set for five-year periods, such back-loaded 
tax proposals have become attractive to lawmakers in this era of fiscal 
restraint. Back-loading allows lawmakers to avoid having to immediately decide 
how to pay for tax breaks without increasing the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury said the GOP proposal for "neutral cost recovery" -- a tax change 
that would allow businesses to write off the costs of new investments 
immediately, rather than waiting several years -- would have a 10-year cost of 
$169.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In their own estimates, the Republicans argued that "neutral cost recovery" 
would actually generate $19.5 billion in new tax revenues in its first five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury estimates that the 10-year cost of the Republican proposal to 
slash the capital gains tax would be $170.4 billion -- compared with five-year 
costs of $57.5 billion. The Republicans estimate that their capital gains plan 
would cost $56 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan carries higher costs in the distant future too, the Treasury 
found. Clinton's proposal for expanding individual retirement accounts would 
cost $3.7 billion over the first five years but would have a 10-year cost of 
$23.3 billion, the Treasury said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's new tax deductions for education and training would cost 
$20.6 billion over the first five years but $60.7 billion over 10 years, the 
department said.

WOMAN ARRESTED ON 3 WARRANTS WALKS OUT BACK DOOR OF COSTA MESA JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 53-year-old woman escaped from the city jail early Saturday, about two hours 
after she was arrested on burglary warrants, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Jane Willis of Santa Ana slipped out a door in the back of the jail, 
Costa Mesa Police Lt. Alan Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She walked through a door that was left ajar," Kent said. "We are unable to 
locate her at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Willis was arrested about midnight at Bay Street and Newport Boulevard on 
charges of driving with a suspended license and providing false information, 
Kent said. Police also discovered that the woman had three warrants -- two for 
burglary and one for narcotics paraphernalia, he said.

COURT REAFFIRMS DIM VIEW OF 3 MILLION YULE LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court has refused to set aside its order dimming a man's 
eye-popping display of 3 million Christmas lights. 
</P>
<P>
 After neighbors filed a lawsuit, Jennings Osborne was ordered Dec. 5 to tone 
down his display enough to reduce the crowds that have been drawn to his 
well-to-do neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne asked the court to let him turn on the lights and music at his home 
while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews whether his religious rights were 
violated. He also argued that the high court's ruling was too broad. Both 
arguments were rejected in Friday's decision.

 Gosh, I guess we had the corporate raiders and the greed of the 1980s, and 
looks like it caught up to us in the 1990s here with the Orange County 
supervisors. I think speculative investing like that should be left to people 
who can afford the consequences. There's an old saying: Never invest money you 
can't afford to lose, and I feel that the county Board of Supervisors and the 
treasurer were being pretty avant-garde with other people's money.

 I am ticked and really, absolutely messed up about how something like this 
could happen in our county. . . . It's absolutely absurd that one man can have 
so much power and all of the supervisors had no control or didn't have any idea 
what was going on.

 A couple of days ago you published the perks received by each member of the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors. My reading is that these perks are only the 
tip if the iceberg and that the perks are much more profound and serious. . . . 
Asking them to resign is just an extreme kindness on our part. I think the bums 
should be fired right now. We have other people who can step in and do just as 
well -- if not a lot better -- than they have done.

 Mismanaged money -- public money -- is going to affect me as a citizen here, 
and I feel that a class-action suit should be filed against the county for 
mismanagement of funds. And I think that the supervisors should be held 
completely responsible for this. There should be more checks and balances set 
up to prevent this from happening again.

OFFICER HELD IN SLAYING OF FORMER FRIEND OVER AFFAIR WITH WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A veteran Anaheim police officer was arrested Saturday on suspicion of murder 
in the shooting death of his wife's lover, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Alex Minn, 36, a motorcycle officer who has been with the department 
for 14 years, was being held in lieu of $250,000 bail at the Robert Pressley 
Detention Center in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Minn is accused of repeatedly shooting Paul Richard Hangen in the head with 
his semiautomatic .45-caliber service weapon, Riverside County sheriff's 
Investigator Mark Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hangen, 28, a Corona welder, was found dead just after 7 p.m. Friday inside a 
pickup truck outside a home in the city of Norco, which borders Corona. Minn 
was arrested about 2:30 p.m. Saturday at his home in Corona, Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police officials were tight-lipped about the arrest Saturday, only 
saying that Minn has been placed on administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But one veteran Anaheim officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
described Minn as a good officer who was well-liked by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said the shooting stemmed from a conflict between the two men because 
Hangen "was having a relationship with Minn's wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Hangen's brother, Tim Hangen, 34, contacted at his mother's Corona home late 
Saturday, also confirmed that his brother, who was not married, had been having 
an affair with the officer's wife. He also said that his brother, who worked 
for a Corona engineering firm, had lived with the Minns for about six months, 
but moved out about two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want people to know that he never did anything to hurt anybody," Tim 
Hangen said. "He didn't do anything to deserve this. This family didn't do 
anything to deserve this." 
</P>
<P>
 Minn and Hangen had "started out as friends" when they first met, about a year 
ago, Tim Hangen said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one answered the door at the Minns' large, two-story Corona home Saturday 
night, where the lights of a Christmas tree glowed through a thin drape.

JUDGE RESTRICTS CHP'S USE OF CHOKEHOLD AFTER JURY AWARDS $470,000 DAMAGES IN 
MAN'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of a homeless Vietnam veteran has led a federal judge to bar the 
California Highway Patrol from using a controversial chokehold except in 
life-threatening situations. 
</P>
<P>
 The carotid restraint is a technique to restrict the flow of blood through the 
carotid arteries to the brain.It requires officers to grab someone around the 
neck, and, using both hands, squeeze on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken made the ruling Friday, two days after a 
jury awarded $470,000 in damages to the son of Randy Bennett, who died when CHP 
officers used the chokehold on him during a struggle on a Pleasanton freeway 
ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly what we wanted," said Andrew Schwartz, the attorney who sued 
the CHP on behalf of the dead man's son. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokeswoman Patricia Ryan said it is not clear what changes will have to 
be made as a result of the ruling. "We are examining the order to see if it is 
consistent with our present policy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Deputy Atty. Gen. Tyler Pon, who represents the CHP, said the agency 
already has adequate restrictions on the use of the carotid restraint. "The 
order . . . actually does very little," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, 45, was stopped in 1992 by CHP officers as he walked along a 
transition ramp between Interstates 580 and 680. He allegedly resisted arrest 
and was placed in a chokehold until he lost consciousness, and later died. His 
son, Scott Bennett Nava of Brentwood, then filed a wrongful death suit against 
the CHP.

ON OREGON'S ROGUE RIVER, WRITERS RETREAT TO HOMESTEAD IN WILDERNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BARNARD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Daniel often writes poems and essays about wilderness, but in four years 
of living in Portland, his ears became hardened by city noises. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quiet alone, I'm finding, is helping," said Daniel of his new home deep 
in the wilds of the Rogue River Canyon. "It's not just a quiet of absence, but 
helped a little by birds and wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel is the third writer in as many years who has been chosen to experience 
the solitude and hard work that go with living on a remote 92-acre homestead 
that was carved out of the Klamath Mountains in southwestern Oregon in the 
1880s. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an experience that brothers Frank and Bradley Boyden enjoyed during 
boyhood summers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to meet a lot of really interesting people and make available an 
opportunity that is extraordinary," said Bradley Boyden, a biology teacher from 
Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, it was just too difficult to hire a caretaker who was both reliable 
and willing to live so far from civilization, said Frank Boyden, an artist from 
the Oregon Coast community of Otis. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Boyden is founder, with his wife, of the Sitka Institute for Art and 
Ecology, which offers residencies to artists from around the world. He 
originally thought the old homestead his parents used for a vacation home could 
be another retreat for artists. But he decided the location was too far from 
art supply sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought, 'Why not start something for writers? They don't need anything,' 
" Frank Boyden said. 
</P>
<P>
 He contacted his old fly-fishing buddy, David James Duncan, author of "The 
River Why" and "The Brothers K," who helped get the retreat going through PEN 
Northwest, a writers' group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly something I would have jumped at any time from my late teens 
into my early 30s," said Duncan. He wrote his first book while living in 
Portland but now lives with his wife and three children in Lolo, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of writers, when you are starting out you are just dealing with 
creating a lengthy space of time. This kind of thing is more valuable, in my 
opinion, than any program," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can grow a great garden, chop wood, hike down to the canyon every day and 
get your exercise in an hour and spend the rest of the day wrestling with great 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden from the summer flow of whitewater rafters on the Rogue River, the 
homestead is accessible over twisting logging roads of gravel and red clay that 
pass through stark clear-cuts and dark forest. Yellow lupine, golden iris, red 
currant and wild mountain lilac bloom along the roadside. The final, jarring 
descent is over a mile of dirt road crossed with 81 water bars, small ditches 
cut to divert rain runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boydens' parents started packing in on horseback to fish and hunt along 
the Rogue in the 1930s. A surgeon from Portland, Dr. Allen Boyden came to the 
wilderness to recuperate from the stress of his profession. The couple bought 
an old homestead in 1968 and built a simple cabin with a deck overlooking a 
meadow with apple trees. After Boyden died, his wife, Margery, turned the place 
over to her sons. 
</P>
<P>
 The original clapboard house from the homestead is still standing, but 
unoccupied. There's a small log barn with a rototiller inside, the caretaker's 
cabin where the writer in residence lives and a pond that helicopters use to 
dip out water to drop on forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
 A big garden is protected from marauding bears and deer by a 6-foot fence 
topped by three strands of solar-powered hot-wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Langdon Cook, a writer in the master of fine arts program at the University of 
Washington in Seattle, spent seven months here last year. He chased bears out 
of the garden, watched a cougar while drinking his morning coffee, tracked down 
the nest of a pair of sharp-shinned hawks, went fly fishing for steelhead, and 
bushwhacked through the hills. He also wrote 200 pages of a novel on a Royal 
manual typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be at home with just yourself," said Cook. "I found the work I 
did really useful in keeping a mental balance: chopping wood, putting up fence, 
digging water bars in the road. When I wasn't writing my fiction, there was 
always something else to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel is well known in environmental and literary circles as the author of a 
book of poems, "Common Ground," and a collection of essays, "The Trail Home." 
He's taking over as chairman of PEN Northwest, and will help choose the next 
writer to live here. 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming this spring, Daniel has chopped wood, planted the garden and 
explored a little of the canyon, finding rusty old pipe left by gold miners 
long ago and a fire ring left by rafters a few days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking is on a stove that will burn wood or propane. Light comes from propane 
lamps. Communication with the outside world is over a radiotelephone powered by 
generator. A battery-powered radio pulls in classical music and National Public 
Radio news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm remote, but still connected to my culture," said Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing in longhand at an old gray Formica kitchen table with chrome legs that 
have a French provincial sweep, Daniel is working on a memoir, "Coming Toward 
Oregon," and refining an essay on the 30th anniversary of the Wilderness Act. 
His new book of poems, "All Things Touched by Wind," is due out soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I write at the table I eat at," Daniel said. "My regular propensity in the 
city is to be a night person, but here I want to use the daylight." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of electricity to power a computer for writing doesn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I can tell when a friend goes to a computer," Daniel said. "He 
starts writing longer poems. Not better poems, longer poems."

before this happened it was a strange situation," said neighbor Terry Towns, 
31, a mechanic for an Orange County trucking firm. "Tom seemed very tolerant 
toward 'Cowboy.' "

GALA BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATERS; 86TH NEWPORT BOAT PARADE GIVES REASON TO 
CHEER IN ANXIOUS TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They know how to throw a Christmas party in Newport Bay. First you order up a 
full moon, pick one of the balmiest December nights in memory, then line up 150 
boats bedecked with elaborate holiday decorations and brimming with revelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 86th annual Newport Harbor Christmas Boat Parade -- which will run nightly 
through Dec. 23 -- kicked off Saturday in grand style. Many longtime parade 
veterans among the thousands who lined the shores of the bay or watched from 
someone's oceanfront home said the boats seemed bigger and more brightly lit 
than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is marvelous," said Frank Rudolph, 80. He has missed only three of the 
boat parades since moving to Lido Isle before World War II and took his own 
boat in the parade when he was younger. "I can't recall a balmier night for it, 
or a more wonderful parade." 
</P>
<P>
 You couldn't tell by this festive crowd that Orange County was embroiled in 
bankruptcy. The only mention of it usually came jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd help out Newport Beach's economy a little bit," laughed Judy 
McCall of Laguna Beach, attending her first Christmas Boat Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade, which starts at 6:30 p.m. and runs about two hours, begins and 
ends at Collins Island -- the western tip of Balboa Island. It takes a U-turn 
at the Marine Avenue Bridge leading to the island, then moves like a mile-long 
glowworm up the bay to Newport Boulevard, where it U-turns again. The boats 
then circle Lido Isle to run the full length of the Balboa Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 There's grandstand viewing available, at the Sea Scout Base along Coast 
Highway and on the peninsula near Marina Park. But most people Saturday night 
just found themselves a spot on the beach, or sitting on a sea wall. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, Don and Sandy Crampton of Newport Beach have crowded in with 
others from the middle of the Marine Avenue Bridge, where the water 
extravaganza turns in front of them. "It's the best spot," Don Crampton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cramptons wouldn't dream of missing it. "It's quite a show," Don Crampton 
said. "They'll spend $10 or 10 thousand dollars decorating those boats." 
</P>
<P>
 It looked like many owners of the vessels -- yachts and sailboats down to 
kayaks -- splurged toward the higher figure. The lead boat -- the Mayor's Boat 
-- was crowned with a Macy's Parade-size Santa Claus, and many of the boats 
that followed were even more splendid, with flashing lights, Christmas music, 
reindeer, and Santas in crows nests. Their audience was delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne and Charles Bozarth of Rolling Hills, who parked on beach blankets near 
the starting line on Balboa Island with nine other family members, have been 
coming to the parade for 14 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a family tradition," said their daughter, Linda Gerbach. "It wouldn't be 
Christmas any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Sloper, whose 33-foot brigantine Go-Getter was lit to the gills with 
Christmas lights, said for years he wouldn't put his boat in the parade, for 
fear he couldn't really see the festivities that way. But he tried it last 
year, learned his view was better than ever and paid his $50 entry fee to 
reserve a spot for his boat again this year. One irritation: He blew a fuse and 
couldn't get his elaborate Santa Claus to light up. But the dozen party-goers 
aboard didn't mind. They waved and cheered to the crowd along the route like 
the rest of them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the cheering that 14-year-old Melissa Moon loves most. Her mother, Laura, 
whose entire party was decked out in Santa Claus hats, agreed: "It's the one 
night of the year when we are all one." 
</P>
<P>
 The merriment wasn't restricted just to watching the parade. The Newport 
Harbor High School Brass Ensemble played Christmas music as a fund-raiser, 
collecting a few dollars from passersby. And one corporate office of 25 showed 
up as a group with sheet music to sing Christmas carols. They were from the 
Anaheim office of Merrill Lynch, the investment firm deeply tied to the 
county's $2-billion investment losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them laughed when someone asked the name of their group. It wasn't the 
time, they said, to talk investments and government blunders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crisis? We have no crisis," said office manager Rochelle Guindon. "This 
business goes up and down. You learn to deal with it. Now sing a Christmas 
carol with us." 
</P>
<P>
 If you plan to see the parade during the next six nights, a word of caution: 
Plan to leave early. Newport Boulevard was jammed for two miles with people 
trying to make it in time to see the parade. And Balboa Island traffic was 
worse than the height of the summer tourist season.

HERE, THE PLAY'S THE THING; TOYS ARE THE LIFE OF THE PARTY FOR NEEDY KIDS

 A smile flashed across Adam Martinez's face as the 8-month-old received his 
first, and possibly only, Christmas present Saturday morning from Orange County 
Red Cross volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have anything," said the toddler's grandmother, Margo Martinez, 42, 
while Adam clutched and stared at the white teddy bear in his small hands. 
"Sometimes, we go without anything for Christmas at all. It makes me feel 
really sad." 
</P>
<P>
 For some families who can't afford presents, this year is different. 
Martinez's grandchild and about 4,000 others lined up as early as 7 a.m. 
Saturday outside the Corbin Community Center on West McFadden Avenue for the 
American Red Cross' sixth annual Holiday Wonderland and Toy Distribution party. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten families from each of Santa Ana's elementary and intermediate schools were 
identified by school officials as those "who might not have a Christmas 
otherwise" and given invitations to the party, said Mark Stier, a volunteer 
organizer with the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Barney the Dinosaur was mobbed outside by children waiting to get into the 
gymnasium full of dolls, stuffed animals, model cars and coloring books. 
Inside, youth volunteers from local schools handed each child a new, unwrapped 
toy suitable for their age and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, more than 4,000 toys were collected from local high schools and 
businesses, with help of Orange County Red Cross Youth Services and its 
auxiliary, Orange Pulp. More than 100 youth volunteers spent their Saturday at 
the center passing out gifts and working with children at crafts tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to see all the little kids smiling when they get their gifts," said 
Alma Olmos, a 13-year-old student at Lathrop Intermediate School in Santa Ana. 
"This is better than any other Christmas gift I could ever receive." 
</P>
<P>
 One child in particular caught Olmos' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people forget to say 'Thank you' or 'Merry Christmas,' but when I 
gave one little girl a Barbie doll, she said 'Thanks,' and she looked like she 
was really happy," Olmos said. "They'll probably all have a better Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanca Vasquez, 26, said she wasn't able to give any of her children presents 
last year. If it weren't for the party, this year would have been the same, she 
said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any money to buy toys with, and my son's school gave me an 
invitation," she said as she knelt next to another son, 1-year-old Jeffrey, who 
squirmed in his stroller as a volunteer tried to paint Santa Claus on his 
cheek. "I feel bad. The illusion children have is to get toys at Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 At the party, Vasquez's other three children, Jesse, 3, Jennifer, 4, and 
Christopher, 8, got a stuffed animal from Disney's "The Lion King," a tea set 
and a dinosaur figure. Christopher later spent part of the afternoon smearing 
green and red frosting on Christmas cookies at a crafts table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy," Vasquez said. "We've never received anything before." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Lopez, 6, couldn't have been any happier with his gift -- action figures 
from his favorite Saturday morning cartoon, "X-Men." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the things he wanted," said Nancy Lopez, 20, as she and her 
three children waited in line at the Christmas ornament-making table. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve examined his X-Men action figures as his 3-year-old sister, Marie, held 
onto a large teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great; they really enjoy what they got," their mother said. "This is 
really a help. It's kind of tough during the holidays, especially when you're a 
single parent looking for a job. I hope by seeing other (needy) people, they 
won't get embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez hasn't been able to work since she became pregnant with her third child, 
Raymond, who was born five months ago. She is on welfare but hopes to find a 
job that will let her work nights so she can be there for her children, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't plan on coming every year," Lopez said. "I'm waiting for Raymond to 
be 6 or 7 months old. (Welfare) isn't going to get you anywhere. You have to 
keep trying. You have to have faith. That's how I look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, more than 200 people attended a party at Camp Pendleton for the 
families of Marines deployed to the Persian Gulf. In addition to an appearance 
by Santa Claus and games and prizes, celebrities from television shows such as 
"Models Inc." and movies such as "The Fisher King" were in attendance.

DISTRUST RUNS DEEP; HOLLYWOOD HILLS TUNNEL PLAN ANGERS FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON D. MARKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bundled-up hikers and mountain bikers start their advance on Runyan Canyon 
Park above Hollywood at dawn each morning, threading through the mountain 
retreat in a quiet parade of exercise and meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently their reverie has been jolted, though, by a new breed of visitors to 
the park -- people with hard hats and work boots, geological maps and hydrology 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Metro Rail is coming to the hillsides soon, and many of the park's admirers -- 
as well as some federal, state and city officials -- fear that the sounds, 
contours and ecology of the eastern Santa Monica Mountains, also known as the 
Hollywood Hills, will never be the same once subway tunneling begins next year. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rest of Los Angeles' subway routes will run under major 
thoroughfares, such as Wilshire and Hollywood boulevards, the northbound link 
will veer away from busy Cahuenga Pass and instead punch a 2.3-mile tunnel 
through the mountains beneath million-dollar homes and National Recreation Area 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial Hollywood-to-Universal City route was approved in 1989 by 
transit authorities after years of political wrangling. But the reality is just 
beginning to jar area residents who face underground boring and blasting until 
at least 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Worries are as plentiful as autumn leaves, but swirl primarily around the 
depletion of vast amounts of precious ground water, the placement of a huge, 
exhaust-belching ventilation shaft almost as deep as Los Angeles' tallest 
skyscraper is high, and what some believe is an inadequate understanding of the 
project's environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Metropolitan Transportation Authority clearly understands, however, 
is the depth of opposition to its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 After the costly and embarrassing construction fiasco it suffered while 
tunneling under Hollywood Boulevard, the MTA is encountering a visceral 
reaction from mountain residents and park users as it approaches the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gable, a singer-songwriter who leads the 4,000-member Runyan Canyon 
Coalition, has pored over thousands of pages of MTA documents and attended 
dozens of City Hall meetings in an effort to comprehend and parry perceived 
threats from the Red Line. Although he has won grudging respect from transit 
authorities for his persistence, he still boils over with frustration at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ruin this park, we're going to kill you," he thundered at an MTA 
official at a recent public meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA, for its part, promises to be a good neighbor. "Protecting the 
mountains' resources is one of our primary goals," said Thomas M. Wilson, the 
MTA's chief engineer on the hillside segment. 
</P>
<P>
 But his promises ring hollow with homeowners like Joan Luchs, a realtor and 
Cahuenga Pass Homeowners Assn. leader who generally favors development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their credibility is shot and we can't trust them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the MTA executive board is expected to award a $124.4-million 
contract that will drive twin gaping holes into the mountains and bring the 
Subway Age to the Valley. But this is only the beginning. In the years ahead, 
as two massive machines burrow through the Hollywood Hills, the unresolved 
construction and environmental issues are sure to remain at the forefront of 
community debate and government oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Transit Agency, a unit of the U.S. Department of Transportation 
charged with monitoring the federally funded Metro Rail project, recently 
contacted through its Los Angeles-based consultants a prominent Thousand Oaks 
geologist named Frank Dennison. 
</P>
<P>
 A practical and cautious scientist who has worked on more than 5,000 grading 
projects throughout the Santa Monica Mountains, he's been toiling alone in his 
office the past couple of weeks, surrounded by 30 sprawling reference books, in 
an effort to independently evaluate the MTA geological studies of the tunnel 
route. Those studies have puzzled him. His concerns swirl around water. 
</P>
<P>
 "MTA's consultants' interpretations of this complex area have been 
simplistic," he said, speaking of the southeastern Santa Monica Mountains. 
"They will find much more water than they're aware of." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those consultants, James F. Dolan of the Southern California Earthquake 
Center at USC, did not dispute Dolan's assertion, responding that simplifying 
the geology "helps engineers understand and take action." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain partisans and the MTA focus intensely on the mountains' buried water 
for different reasons: Conservationists believe it nourishes plants and animals 
that live on the surface. The MTA worries about the extent to which it will 
sabotage its tunneling. More water means a longer dig, and that means much 
higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennison, an old hand who does three-dimensional rock modeling in his head 
rather than on a supercomputer, advises that understanding the area's seismic 
history is the key to calculating its reserves of water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains, he noted, are the result of 40 million years of 
upheaval, rotation and twisting. The tunnel will drive through a major fold 
created 2 million years ago and cross at least three major fault zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard part for geologists, Dennison said, is to create a picture of the 
rock before and after each gyration in its past, because it is behind those 
folds and faults that water dripping down from rain clouds and lawn sprinklers 
dams up. 
</P>
<P>
 How much water? There's the rub. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Sperry, lead environmental specialist for the MTA, says the authority 
estimates it will draw 2,000 acre-feet of water out of the ground during 
digging for the Universal City-Hollywood segment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gary Schultz, associate engineer at the California Regional Water 
Quality Control Board, however, the MTA has applied for permits to discharge 
nearly four times that much into the Los Angeles River over two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another water expert believes the amount could exceed even that. Mel Blevins, 
executive engineer at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and 
court-appointed Watermaster of the San Fernando Valley, estimates that 2,000 
acre-feet of water will be pumped out of the ground during the excavation of 
the Universal City station alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But not only are officials at odds over how much water will flow out of the 
mountains, they don't agree on how to dispose of it or whether the MTA should 
pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Blevins accounts for the Valley's ground water as if it were money in the 
bank, and he is responsible for forcing companies and public agencies to pay 
the DWP for any that they remove. He complains that in several meetings, MTA 
officials have "tried to twist my arm" to waive his $700,000 bill for the 
Universal City station dewatering. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I won't allow it," Blevins said. "I think every cost of a program ought 
to be accounted and paid for, or you don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Edelman, staff ecologist of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, among 
others, has urged the MTA to "recharge" the Valley's ground-water table with 
the mountain water instead of pouring it into the Los Angeles River. The MTA 
likes that idea; Sperry said her office has studied that prospect extensively, 
proposing to offset the money requested by Blevins with the value of the 
recharged water. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be impractical, however, because the Universal City water is 
contaminated with hydrocarbons and solvents, and the mountain water is likely 
to contain high levels of sulfates, dissolved solids and arsenic. 
</P>
<P>
 Injecting that water back into the Valley's well system would require the MTA 
to trespass through a dizzying maze of water-quality regulations and 
jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Yamamoto, regional chief of the state Department of Health Services, cast 
doubt on the transit authority's ability to comply with rules he set out for 
them. Yet he has not necessarily deterred the MTA's earnest effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a win-win situation where we can recharge the water and even improve 
it," said Sperry of the MTA. "But if the costs are excessive, we'll have to 
discharge it into the river." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is always Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid much pumping at all, the MTA would ideally like to plug up the 
mountain's water-bearing fractures with grout as it tunnels through. 
</P>
<P>
 In public meetings, MTA public affairs manager Mark R. Pattison relates this 
technique with relish. He describes how the contractor's tunnel-boring machines 
-- which look like giant, boxy centipedes tipped with broad metal claws -- rip 
through rock a few feet at a time, then stop to scout. If long sensors detect 
water, the contractor can shoot grout under high pressure into the cracks of 
the mountain to dry it up. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA puts a lot of stock in this method, but Blevins, with 35 years of 
experience in the Valley underground, pooh-poohs it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't grout -- I think it's technically impossible," said the DWP 
executive engineer. "Ground water moves too slowly in the mountain, and you're 
talking about way too many fractures. It'll leak, leak, leak all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the drip-drip-drip of water torture is exactly what the subway 
project has seemed like to Joan Luchs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cahuenga Pass homeowners leader is still steamed about losing the battle 
to keep the tunnel under the Hollywood Freeway. But she, and neighbors in the 
eastern mountains, are even more alarmed about the MTA's plan to sink a tunnel 
ventilation shaft through the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The animals are going to go airborne when they hear that tunneling," she 
said. "And we hillside homeowners are going to get all of the impact and none 
of the benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 An emergency exhaust and rescue shaft became necessary when the subway 
alignment shifted away from the Cahuenga Pass and a Hollywood Bowl station was 
eliminated. It has been designed as an 850-foot-deep, 22-foot-wide concrete 
pipe that to install would require blasting out earth for more than two years 
and 20 to 40 dirt-hauling trips a day down narrow, winding Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaft location chosen by MTA engineers is just a few yards from the 
northwestern boundary of much-loved, city-owned Runyan Canyon Park, a site that 
is included in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and a former 
retreat of swashbuckling 1940s film star Errol Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 A somewhat homely hideaway that sports a modestly paved road, abandoned tennis 
courts, gangly sprinkler pipes in its valley and piebald chaparral on its 
hillsides, Runyan is nonetheless deeply admired by countless flatland refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Visit any time of day and you'll see old, shirtless Russian men, or young UCLA 
marathoners, or arm-in-arm West Hollywood couples, stretching, biking, or 
walking Dalmatians up to its Cloud's Rest, a spectacular aerie with a panoramic 
view of the Los Angeles Basin and a bench to ponder it from. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the closest thing to a natural canyon on the basin side of the Santa 
Monicas," said John Diaz, land acquisition chief for the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy. "It's a real treat for people who live in gridlock and growth and 
garbage to come out and experience open space. If the MTA goes ahead with their 
plan, they could leave it arid." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Slosson, an expert in Santa Monica Mountains hydrology who was once 
the state's chief geologist, said park advocates shouldn't worry much about 
plant survival. Most hillside vegetation shoots roots less than five feet below 
the ground and depends only on rainwater, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The subway project's original environmental impact report, filed in 1983, did 
not discuss any biological impact of tunneling through the mountains, and a 
subsequent environmental report in 1989 provided no data on the ecological 
impact of a vent shaft. 
</P>
<P>
 The scarcity of information has fueled the ire and provoked the paranoia of 
area activists as well as federal and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been given the kiss-off," said David E. Gackenbach, superintendent of 
the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, who has demanded that the MTA find 
another spot for the vent shaft because the current location will impair the 
use of federal parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer, the MTA surprised many by its apparent willingness to change 
its mind: It separated the vent shaft construction from the tunnel contract 
under pressure from the Runyan Canyon Coalition and Los Angeles City Council 
President John Ferraro. It has also told neighbors and city officials that it 
will study at least three alternate shaft sites and undertake an environmental 
analysis of those proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leading alternatives call for a horizontal shaft blasted either from a 
city street tree yard in the Cahuenga Pass or from privately owned land just 
below Mulholland Drive near the top of Hillpark Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is convinced that the ventilation shaft will be moved away 
from Runyan Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The MTA board operates in a star chamber -- they always appear to be 
negotiating in good faith but you never really know," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transit Authority will soon award a contract to dig twin 
subway tunnels south from Universal City through the eastern Santa Monica 
Mountains to Hollywood. Its contractor will first excavate a vast hole beside 
the Hollywood Freeway at Lankershim Boulevard, then use two tunnel-boring 
machines to claw 12,300 feet through hard rock; 18 cross-over passages between 
tunnels, and a midline ventilation shaft, will be excavated by explosives. 
These will be the only Red Line tunnels in Los Angeles that intersect an active 
earthquake fault.

WIDOW CAMPAIGNS TO GET MORE ASIANS AS MARROW DONORS; HEALTH: YAE RAN HYUN 
STRIVES TO FULFILL DYING WISH OF LEUKEMIA-STRICKEN HUSBAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE SEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Korean American patient had suffered a relapse of leukemia, and his 
chances of finding a donor with matching bone marrow for a transplant were slim 
-- as they are with other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But through the yearlong efforts of Irvine resident Yae Ran Hyun, the UC 
Berkeley graduate student found a newly registered bone-marrow donor in Orange 
County. His doctor called the find a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a success story keeps Hyun motivated to carry out the dying wish of her 
late husband, Young Hwi Hyun, who couldn't find a bone marrow donor to help him 
overcome leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I'll die, but no more people like me should die,' " his widow said. 
</P>
<P>
 To carry out her late husband's wish, the 41-year-old Hyun has spent the past 
16 months trying to encourage more Korean Americans to register with the 
National Marrow Donor Program as possible bone marrow donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her organization, Give Him a Life, which was founded four months 
before her husband's death last December, Hyun has increased the number of 
registered Korean donors in the United States from 1,800 to 7,500. She hopes to 
boost that number to 30,000 by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The organization is not just for me, but for all Korean people," said Hyun, 
who moved to California from Korea a few months after her husband's illness was 
diagnosed in July, 1992. "My only motivation in doing this is to try to help 
other people." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1.5 million people are registered with the national donor program in 
Minneapolis. Of these potential donors, only about 66,000 are Asian; 95,000 are 
African American and 90,000 are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minority groups have the least chance of finding matching donors because they 
have fewer donors in the registry," said Jennifer Caliandro, spokeswoman for 
the National Marrow Donor Program. "It's not impossible for a match to cross 
racial barriers, but tissue types tend to be more similar among people of the 
same race." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross in Orange County, in fact, is looking for Filipino and 
other Asian Pacific donors for Nancy Alegado, a 20-year-old Filipino American 
who is critically ill with leukemia. The organization said the chances of 
finding a compatible marrow donor are greater within a similar ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 For Koreans and other Asian Americans, however, cultural beliefs discourage 
them from donating blood or any part of their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to traditional Confucian beliefs, our body is a gift from our 
ancestors, so we shouldn't alter it in any way," Hyun said. "Koreans also are 
fearful because they don't really know what bone marrow is. The Korean word for 
bone marrow is similar to the word for brain, so they are instantly turned 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 To educate people about the bone marrow donation process, Hyun has made 
presentations to dozens of Korean church and community groups across the 
country. She also has established branch offices for Give Him a Life in Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Hyun said, two Korean American leukemia patients have been matched 
with donors she recruited. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those patients was the UC Berkeley student, Young Ho Moon, who recently 
underwent a successful bone marrow transplant at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center in Seattle. His donor is a Korean American woman in Orange 
County, whose identity wasn't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Hyun's) program wasn't there, the chance of me finding a donor would be 
almost none," said Moon, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long shot, but this just came out of the blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Moon, who went into relapse a few months before his operation, said an initial 
search through the national registry found only one possibility, a donor who 
still would have had to undergo tests to see if the marrow types matched. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors told me that normally a Caucasian person would have 20 to 100 
possible donors after a preliminary search," said Moon, who hopes to return to 
school next fall. "Then there's only a 20% chance that any of those potential 
donors would match. So I knew my chances were really slim." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Orange County donor was placed on the national registry. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a perfect match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a miracle that a newly recruited donor would be a perfect match," said 
John Hansen, one of Moon's doctors at the cancer institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole donor program depends on this type of grass-roots community effort 
to increase the number of donors. Lives are being saved because of these 
efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyun's efforts go beyond merely registering donors. 
</P>
<P>
 When she hears of a Korean American with leukemia or blood disease, she visits 
them at her own expense and offers them advice based on her own experiences. So 
far, she has made about 16 trips to various cities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I see a patient, I think of my husband and that makes me want to 
help them," said Hyun, who has two teen-aged children. "I'm a strong believer 
that people have to spend their lives trying to help other people." 
</P>
<P>
 To become registered, donors must be between 18 and 55 and in good health. A 
small sample of their blood is tested to determine its marrow type, and their 
names are placed in the national registry. The usual fee is waived for minority 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
 If a match is made, a small amount of marrow is collected from the donor's 
pelvic bone. Although the donor may experience some pain, bone marrow naturally 
replenishes itself within a few weeks.

DUO WITH ALL THE ANSWERS SHARE SECRETS; EDUCATION: HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC 
DECATHLON CHAMPIONS GRADUATE TO MORE LUCRATIVE TRADE BY SELLING PRACTICE EXAMS 
FOR THE ELITE COMPETITION. BUT SOME CUSTOMERS SAY THAT THE PAIR DIDN'T DO THEIR 
HOMEWORK.

<P>
 While most college-bound high school graduates would be content to pick up a 
few extra tuition dollars by working as office clerks or store cashiers, two 
former Academic Decathlon champions have parlayed their renowned school 
experience into cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Berdichevsky and Andrew Salter, Wunderkinder of the ivory tower, have 
ventured into the nuts-and-bolts world of business with their own start-up 
company that sells practice exams to decathlon teams around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The enterprise, named DemiDec -- an abbreviation derived from the words 
academic decathlon -- has earned $20,000 since August for the two 18-year-old 
alumni of Taft High School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our coach at Taft was always preaching theories of economic freedom to us," 
Berdichevsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academic Decathlon is a national high school competition that tests 
students in subjects including math, science and fine arts.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, John Marshall High School in Los Feliz won the city 
championship over Taft and is headed for the state finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdichevsky and Salter have a sterling reputation in decathlon circles. Both 
were members of the mighty Taft High team that shattered city and state 
decathlon records on its way to the 1993 national championship. Berdichevsky 
was the highest individual scorer at the city, state and national competitions, 
followed closely each time by Salter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Berdichevsky and Salter are freshman at Harvard and Stanford, 
respectively, they have transformed their decathlon titles into a calling card 
for their fledgling business. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, the two champions found themselves short of pocket change after 
being fined $27 each for jaywalking near Taft. In the midst of courthouse 
grumbling about the fines, they came up with the DemiDec idea. 
</P>
<P>
 They decided to seek the approval of their coach, Taft instructor Arthur 
Berchin. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction when I found out they were doing this was, 'You're going to 
be selling this to all of my competitors and make things tougher for me,' " 
Berchin said. "But there was nothing I could do to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 So the two spent all summer sequestered in local libraries. The result was a 
thick stack of tests, study notes and a copy of the pair's award-winning 
decathlon speeches. Touting the kit as a "Passport to Chicago," site of the 
1995 decathlon championships, they have sold about 200 of the $189 packages to 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 They mailed out query letters urging decathlon coaches to buy DemiDec to help 
their students "focus on victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Practice tests are a common part of training for decathletes, and a small 
number of companies, most founded by former coaches and testing professionals, 
have specialized in selling them to schools. Academic Decathlon officials do 
not endorse any company, instead offering their own set of study materials, 
said Judy Combs of the California Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdichevsky and Salter's popularity convinced many coaches to buy the package 
sight unseen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were happy to see them and their entrepreneurial spirit," said George 
Floratos, who has led Torrance's West High to five consecutive county 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But first-year jitters may have led to accuracy problems in the tests, 
according to many of the coaches who bought the package. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early snafu, Berdichevsky and Salter had to mail out revised answer keys 
to their science test because none of the correct answers matched the 
questions. "We found several errors, but we find errors in all testing 
materials," Floratos said. "But I'm sure their product will get better as they 
age and have more time to commit." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not so generous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought their tests because they were very personable and they had the aura 
of Taft's victory, but our team members were really thoroughly disgusted," 
Chatsworth coach Nina Hackett said. "There were so many mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Salter said it will be "extremely important to us to remedy those mistakes."

DECKING THE HALLS WITHOUT LIFTING A FINGER; HOLIDAYS: SOME ARE TOO BUSY TO DO

OF SANTA'S HELPERS WHO, FOR A FEE, WILL SET UP THE TREE AND ALL THE TRIMMINGS.

 Monica Roach didn't reach for the ladder when it came time this year to deck 
the halls with boughs of holly. 
</P>
<P>
 She reached for the phone and called someone to come decorate her Christmas 
tree and hang the stockings with care over her brick fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get less younger, Christmas can get overwhelming," explained the 
grandmotherly Roach as she admired her 8-foot noble fir while the tune "Santa 
Claus is Coming to Town" played in the background on her family room stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 Her gaily outfitted Arcadia home is one of a dozen that Kathy Brundage 
decorated this year. Brundage is among a handful of Los Angeles-area experts 
who will pick a Christmas tree and ornaments for you and set it up in the 
middle of your living room -- for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better, she will come back and take everything down after Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Brundage's Christmas clients include wealthy homeowners who want their homes 
looking sharp for holiday entertaining, klutzy bachelors who lack the artistic 
touch and people who are just too busy -- or too frail -- to hang mistletoe 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having Kathy come in means I can spend my time enjoying the season and not 
have the stress," said Roach, whose house and yard are filled with Santas, 
reindeer, angels and holiday ornaments of every description. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I wouldn't do it if I had to do it all myself." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a story to virtually every ornament in Roach's house and Brundage uses 
photographs of past Christmas holidays to replicate their placement -- right 
down to the last string of popcorn wrapped around her fragrant green tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 40 years of memories here," Roach said. "This little candy cane was 
made by one of my daughters. Another daughter made this angel. That little bird 
over there was given by the doctor who brought another daughter into the world 
40 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who hire outsiders to decorate their homes are looking for a new look 
each December, however. Some rent different ornaments each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We change it each Christmas. You don't want it to get boring. You don't want 
people to think it looks the same every year," said El Monte resident Sandra 
Pecarovich, who has hired Brundage to decorate her tree six times. 
</P>
<P>
 Pecarovich and her husband, Pete, operate a construction remodeling business 
that requires them to entertain almost nightly during the holiday season. That 
means everything must look just right. 
</P>
<P>
 The same 300 ornaments are used annually on their 10-foot artificial tree. But 
Brundage adds new decorations, plus "a touch of garland here, a little ribbon 
there, so it never looks the same," Pecarovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every client has a different idea about what looks good and what doesn't, 
according to Brundage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a single guy three years ago. Then he got married and he and his wife 
decorated their tree. But they fought over how the decorations should go. Now, 
they're getting a divorce. This year we did his tree for him again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few florists and interior decorators in the Los Angeles area will do 
Christmas decorating if valued customers ask. But Brundage's service evolved 
from requests by customers at her Arcadia gift and furnishings shop called All 
Seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would come in and look at displays and say, 'I'd like to have a tree 
just like that one,' " she said. Brundage charges $40 an hour for a two-person 
decorating crew; the typical home-decorating job takes about six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday decorating done by Chatsworth designer Farla Binder costs from $800 to 
$10,000, depending on the size of the job and whether the homeowner rents or 
buys lights and ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Binder's residential work is an outgrowth of an 18-year-old party-decorating 
and office building decoration service she calls Creations by Farla. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her clients are embarrassed to ask for help, Binder said. Others are 
in a panic: "We get a lot of last-minute calls from people who are having a 
party and want the place to look festive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people want the trees to go with the color scheme of their house. 
They'll have a mauve decor, so we'll go with cranberry and mauve ribbons, and 
maybe a touch of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times people in the film industry don't want people to know that 
they didn't do the decorating themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago a television executive wanted a Simpsons cartoon motif for his 
home, Binder said. So her staff -- which more than triples in size to 40 
workers each Christmas -- painted Simpson characters on cardboard cutouts and 
mixed them in with the normal tinsel and bows. 
</P>
<P>
 Brundage said her most unusual decorating challenge was at a house owned by a 
big-game hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to garland all of the stuffed tigers and deer," she said. "It was very 
strange having all of those glass eyes looking at you as you were hugging the 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Roach's house, Brundage was putting on the final touches -- making 
certain an electric train circled an 8-foot Christmas rug and checking to see 
that fresh batteries were in the Santa Claus candy dish that went "Ho-Ho-Ho" 
when a chocolate drop was lifted out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you relinquish tradition, you relinquish part of your life," explained 
Roach -- smiling as she listened to the tingling of tiny Christmas chimes over 
her front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't decorate yourself, ask someone to help you -- a friend, or the 
Boy Scouts if you don't have money to pay someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody who feels like Christmas is getting to be just too much should 
reach out to a person like Kathy."

INFLUENCE PEDALING; BICYCLING: MAYOR RIORDAN LEADS A COMMUNITY TOUR TO PROMOTE 
THE SPORT AND SHOWS SKEPTICS JUST HOW FIT A RIDER HE REALLY IS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hector Rodriguez had heard all about the bicycling mayor of Los Angeles, about 
how Richard Riordan liked to take his vacations riding across the French 
countryside atop one of his fleet of top-flight racing and mountain bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd heard that Riordan was in great shape, that he'll sometimes skip a 
weekday lunch for a quick Downtown biking jaunt between meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 And so on Saturday, along the 27-mile course of Ride L.A.: Mayor Riordan's 
Community Bike Tour across the west San Fernando Valley, Rodriguez decided to 
see for himself, to take a good look at this mayor who can blow away riders 
half his age with muscular bursts of speed.  
</P>
<P>
 As Riordan pedaled along Balboa Boulevard, swallowed by a tightknit pack of 
riders, the 32-year-old Metropolitan Transit Authority worker drew close and 
checked out the shape of the competition. Then he shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I had to do was take one look at the legs, to see how well the quadriceps 
were developed," said the former professional cyclist as he rounded a turn amid 
a pack of riders. "He rides. The man rides a bike." 
</P>
<P>
 So serious is this mayor about the sport of cycling, riders say, he keeps his 
legs clean shaven -- a precaution many avid cyclists use to avoid infections 
that result from scrapes suffered in wipeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, clad in black Lycra biking shorts, a black and white pullover 
racing jersey and helmet, riding an expensive foreign-made Moser brand bike he 
said was gift from a group of Italian cyclists, Riordan was out front for much 
of the three-hour ride, setting a brisk pace, a security officer huffing and 
puffing along behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 On the sunny weekend morning, the mayor was joined by some 350 riders of all 
ages, the largest turnout yet, on the fourth installment of eight community 
bike tours, a program designed to allow residents from throughout the city to 
experience its disparate neighborhoods, from Northridge to Watts to Venice 
Beach -- all from the top of a bicycle seat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute. This is Los Angeles, a city known for its love affair with 
the automobile and the combustible engine, the land of 70-m.p.h. freeway speeds 
or, more likely, traffic gridlock and idling engines. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what Los Angeles is all about, not sitting in traffic along the San 
Diego Freeway," Riordan said before starting his ride.  
</P>
<P>
 "You feel free and open and you can see the city at your own pace. The 
automobile traps you. I encourage this mode of transportation, if you can pull 
it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was supported by legions of serious cyclists. The starting point 
Saturday at a Cal State Northridge parking lot was a sea of colorful 
tight-fitting outfits, of 60-year-old men and women who looked 20 years 
younger. There were clutches of organized club members eager to show their 
stuff, boys on mountain bikes, husbands and wives on tandem units. 
</P>
<P>
 There were tricycles bearing decorated Christmas trees, jazzy racers costing 
$3,000 or more, as well as low-slung experimental bikes with their 
funky-looking handlebars located below the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 They supported Riordan's ride and his efforts to promote cycling as an 
alternative mode of transportation in a region where many frustrated, 
road-weary motorists are seen to regard the cyclist as Public Enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is just fantastic," said Darien Mann, a 33-year-old computer 
programmer who often rides his bike to and from work. "Maybe other people will 
see this on their television sets and decide to take a bike ride tonight 
instead of a spin in their cars." 
</P>
<P>
 But other members of the San Fernando Valley Bicycle Club said that while 
getting the word out is a great idea, the mayor needs to ensure that the Valley 
and other areas have well-maintained bike lanes and trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to see the city spend a little money to smooth the railroad 
crossings and create these lanes because right now the Valley is pretty 
dangerous place to ride a bike," said Mark Reden, a 41-year-old grocery store 
produce manager and avid cyclist. "The services just aren't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Rodriguez agreed: "This city still has a long way to go. Before the 
Olympics, you never saw a bicycle on the streets of Los Angeles. And still, the 
logistics are confusing. Not all public transportation options, subways and 
buses, allow you to take bicycles on board. We've got to develop a cohesive 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 From its start at Cal State Northridge, the bicycle tour wound its way along 
several of the West Valley's wider boulevards, with experienced riders 
jockeying for position in the front ranks. A traveling police motorcade stopped 
curious motorists just long enough for the cyclists to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, some participants were thrilled to see the officers halt the often 
insistent traffic as bikers breezed through normally clogged city 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," one man exclaimed, "no red-lights!" 
</P>
<P>
 The group took a 20-minute break at Warner Ranch Park in Woodland Hills, where 
10-year-old Chris Molletti presented the mayor with an award for his efforts to 
promote bicycle safety and helmet use. The boy's helmet recently saved his life 
when he was struck by a car in Long Beach and thrown more than 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the road, riders exchanged introductions and talked business. Some 
held pocket cameras over their heads to capture the motorcade. And some talked 
about Mayor Riordan and his biking exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard that on one of these rides he was cruising along with a group of 
professional cyclists," said Reden of the Valley biking group. "Suddenly, the 
mayor turns to these guys and says, real politely, 'Do you guys mind if we pick 
up the pace a bit?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan seems to revel in the attention. At the start of the return trip from 
Woodland Hills, he raced to the head of the group and turned to a group of 
organized riders in colorful outfits. "There he is, El Capitan! " one called 
out. The mayor turned and gave them a wicked smile: "You guys look like a bunch 
of wimps to me." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone had heard of Mayor Riordan and his cycling reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ride a bike that often, but I'll match the mayor for sure," said 
42-year-old Tim Dorsey as he stood in line to register for the ride. "I mean, 
how hard could that be? How old is the guy anyway? He must be near retirement 
age, or past it." 
</P>
<P>
 And within minutes from the start, another cyclist called out: "Hey, where's 
the mayor? He probably dropped out within a half-mile of the starting line. No 
sense taking any risks now." 
</P>
<P>
 What he didn't know was that Riordan was well in front of him, near the 
leaders of the ride, calling out to the pair of motorcycle cops to pick up 
their pace. Not so he could crank up his speed, but so cyclists could spread 
out and ride more safely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the pace of these bicyclists resembled rush-hour traffic. The faster 
riders complained the pace was too slow, the slower ones that it was too fast. 
"Hey, dude, this is no longer cool," one rail-thin man in a screaming yellow 
outfit said to a friend. "I know, man," the other responded. "My brakes are on 
more than not." 
</P>
<P>
 When the lead motorcycle officers stopped the group to allow stragglers to 
catch up, the bikes bunched into a group tighter than any freeway gridlock. 
Riders cut off other riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, why you!" called out one man. "Thanks a lot, lady. I thought I was 
getting away from women drivers today." 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the day, the mayor blended in with the group, most often riding 
near the front, chatting with whomever matched his pace. But just miles from 
the finish line, he turned on a burst of speed and, security man in tow, raced 
to the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we come out here, more and more people take part in these rides," 
Riordan said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I learn a lot about this city this way. People in bureaucracies don't always 
tell you things. So this is the way I get out and see them for myself."

DETAILS OF BURBANK MALL NEGOTIATIONS EMERGE; DEVELOPMENT: COUNCIL MEMBERS 
REJECTED CITY MANAGER'S ADVICE TO TAKE $2-MILLION OFFER IN FAVOR OF WHAT BECAME 
A $10-MILLION DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to bring an ill-fated mall partnership to an end, Burbank City Manager 
Robert (Bud) Ovrom once recommended that the City Council accept a $2-million 
cash offer from developer Alexander Haagen and not push for any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much . . . for us already on the table that we fear losing it by 
pushing Haagen beyond where he can be reasonably expected to go," Ovrom wrote 
in a confidential memo. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Bill Wiggins and Vice Mayor Dave Golonski rejected Ovrom's advice. 
They and the rest of the council held out for a better deal before giving up 
the city's interest in the financially troubled Media City Center shopping 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the city will receive $10 million over the next two years in a 
buyout deal that became final earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong contrast in judgment between elected officials and Ovrom, who has 
overseen the city's troubled mall venture from its beginning in 1989, stands 
out in interviews with key players and documents covering months of 
negotiations between Burbank representatives and Haagen that were obtained by 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had refused to release the documents, but agreed to do so once 
the buyout became final Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers provide a behind-the-scenes glimpse into what is perhaps the city's 
most costly private business venture. 
</P>
<P>
 One memo from Ovrom to the council, for example, shows that he and other city 
employees struggled to find the best way to present the complicated deal to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month before the deal became public in October, Ovrom wrote to 
council members in a memo attached to a staff report: "You will recall this is 
one you said needed to be particularly 'brilliant.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The file also shows Haagen's unhappiness with the mall's developments. A 
letter from Haagen to the council in July points out the developer's 
frustration over his five-year partnership with the Burbank Redevelopment 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in my wildest imagination did I foresee that the positive working 
relationship that we have had with the city of Burbank would deteriorate to the 
degree that it has," Haagen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that partnership, both sides agreed to split net operating profits from 
the mall, 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city has not seen any profits since the shopping center opened in 
1991. In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Haagen 
stated that the mall has lost millions of dollars in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to raise much-needed capital, the Alexander Haagen Co. went 
public last December, selling stock and ultimately earning $374 million from 
investors in the new firm, Alexander Haagen Properties Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $90 million of that money went toward paying the remaining 
$169-million debt on the Media City Center, documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, documents and interviews show, city officials were hopeful they 
would finally begin to see their share of profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Haagen's lawyer argued the debt had simply been replaced by new debt 
to the shareholders of the new company. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the city would not see any profits until after Haagen's shareholders 
earned back their money through dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen and city officials faced the potential for "an enormous lawsuit over 
who gets what and what goes to whom," said Tom Clark, a Newport Beach attorney 
who served as Burbank's chief negotiator during the life of the mall project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been awful," he said. "It would have been complete chaos with 
the shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 The last straw came in June, when Haagen attempted to pledge the Media City 
Center as collateral securing a $75-million line of credit. Only $15 million 
was to be used on the mall, according to city documents. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, a senior vice president for Haagen, Fred Bruning, suggested a 
buyout of the city's interest in the shopping center to resolve the 
disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen's first offer was to pay $2 million in cash, reduce a $51-million loan 
to the city to $38 million and give back to the city sales taxes generated by 
34 of the 149 mall stores and by a nearby Circuit City, Office Depot and 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had earlier given those revenues to Haagen for 10 years or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's negotiating team -- made up of Clark, Ovrom, Assistant City Manager 
Steve Helvey, City Atty. Joe Fletcher and Community Development Director Bob 
Tague -- countered by asking for $3 million in cash, along with everything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at that time that Ovrom advised the City Council to settle for Haagen's 
first offer. In an interview, Golonski described how, for one of the few times 
during the Burbank-Haagen negotiations, the elected officials felt comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one of the only times where the risk of not reaching an agreement 
would not have been the end of the world for us," Golonski said in an 
interview. "To accept a $2-million settlement just wasn't worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Ovrom said again that at the time he believed $2 million was a fair 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had financial consultants who were telling us $2 million-plus was a 
reasonable deal. To me, it was an immense victory that we walked away with $10 
million," Ovrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovrom also said that the discussion in the documents of presenting the deal in 
the best light was not a matter of exaggerating its benefits, but of explaining 
it clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not trying to sugarcoat it," Ovrom said in an interview last week. 
"The problem we have with lots of things is, how do we translate all this 
complexity into a way a person can understand?" 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a critical role in watching over the negotiating team were Wiggins and 
Golonski, who acted as liaisons between the city's negotiating team and the 
council and sat in on the final crucial meetings with Haagen's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Haagen not agreed to more than his $2-million offer, Golonski said he and 
others with the city were willing to go to court to settle the issue of 
remaining debt on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting everything aside, the biggest benefit of this ($10-million) deal is 
it removed the uncertainty for the city," Golonski said. "The city was in a 
position where it may not have gotten anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The buyout deal gives Haagen the right to develop two remaining parcels near 
the mall and continue leasing the mall land for just $1,000 a year for 95 
years. Meanwhile, the city gives up its share of the mall's profits.

SCHOOL BOUNDARY CHANGE PROPOSAL IN SANTA CLARITA ANGERS PARENTS; EDUCATION: 
MANY FEAR INCREASED CRIME, DECLINE IN ACADEMIC QUALITY IF POOR, LATINO STUDENTS 
MOVE INTO MOSTLY WHITE ELEMENTARY CLASSROOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Parents in this suburban community are upset over a proposed redrawing of 
elementary school boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are not just concerned that their children might be transferred to a 
different school. Some are worried that children from the poor side of this 
mostly middle-class, mostly white community will be coming to their 
neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Margie Veis, who moved from Van Nuys to the Stevenson Ranch housing 
development just west of Santa Clarita two years ago, said the mostly Latino 
East Newhall neighborhood -- from which some students could be transferred to a 
school in her development -- reminds her of the high-crime area she fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to come across as a bad person," said Veis, who has two 
children of elementary-school age. "But when you've seen it happen . . . . I 
saw the crime, saw the drugs, saw the drive-by shootings, and it was time to 
get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents, who last week flocked to public meetings held by the Newhall 
School District to comment on three boundary proposals, complained that Latinos 
do not get heavily involved in parent-school activities. Resources that could 
go to regular instruction, some parents said, are instead being used in 
bilingual classrooms, shortchanging English-dominant students. 
</P>
<P>
 Alba Steck, community liaison for the district's bilingual program, tried to 
counter that argument, but about 10 parents loudly interrupted her, insisting 
bilingual education had lowered standards in the 5,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Chris Marchese, whose daughter attends Old Orchard Elementary School, 
said: "I will say that since we've gone to a bilingual program the level of 
education is not what it should be." Old Orchard has a 42% minority enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one parent, Shirley Laurino of Valencia, views the comments by 
other parents as shortsighted -- and she said so at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, she added: "These stupid parents, they're so worried about 
someone getting to know someone from the other side of tracks. They're all 
going to be in the same setting when they get together in junior high." 
</P>
<P>
 And school officials pointed out Newhall Elementary School -- the school 
closest to East Newhall and with a 53% minority enrollment -- was one of only 
220 schools in the United States this year to win a National Blue Ribbon Award 
from the U. S. Department of Education for excellence in its overall 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The boundary changes are needed to ensure there are enough students attending 
the new Stevenson Ranch Elementary School set to open next fall, said Supt. J. 
Michael McGrath. He said 283 students who live in Stevenson Ranch will attend 
the school, but about 200 more need to be moved in from Valencia and Newhall to 
help even out enrollments throughout the seven-school district. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the proposed plans would transfer students from the upscale Valencia 
Summit neighborhood to Stevenson Ranch. That proposal would take 186 students 
from Old Orchard Elementary, raising the minority ratio there from 42% to 49%, 
which concerns parents who don't want more resources devoted to Old Orchard's 
bilingual program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want whatever plan that is going to keep Old Orchard as it is," Marchese 
said of the three boundary plans. "I just hate to see a larger Hispanic group 
going to Old Orchard." 
</P>
<P>
 Another plan would send about 160 students from East Newhall, who are 
currently attending Old Orchard, to the Stevenson Ranch school. McGrath said 
Old Orchard's bilingual program would be transferred to Stevenson Ranch as 
well, since the new school would have a 49% minority ratio and Old Orchard's 
would drop to 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about minority enrollment dominated the district's first meeting of 
about 50 parents last Monday night at Wiley Canyon Elementary School. Julie 
Glenn, a Valencia resident, suggested Newhall Elementary School be turned into 
a "magnet" school for all Latinos in the bilingual program, because it would 
help those students learn English faster. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was well-received by other parents in the audience, some nodding 
their heads or muttering comments of approval. But McGrath said such a school 
would amount to an illegal segregation of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you'd have is a Mexican school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you've got is a Mexican neighborhood," Glenn replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'd end up in court and we'd lose," McGrath answered. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of many exchanges between district officials and parents at the 
meetings. The aim of the meetings, officials said, was to gauge public 
sentiment and to pass on those thoughts to trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the 100 parents at a second meeting, held Tuesday night at Valencia 
Valley Elementary School, were worried about who would be transferred to their 
school. Residents there focused instead on whether a year-round calendar would 
be continued and who would be transferred if authorities revert to a 
traditional nine-month calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the parents' comments from the two meetings will be considered by the 
district's Board of Trustees when it votes on a final plan Jan. 24, McGrath 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If parents accept whatever changes occur gracefully, their children probably 
will too, Laurino said. She said children left alone "will make friends with 
just about anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about the ethnic balance," she added. "I care about the attitude 
balance."

GOING HOME; ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT RETURNS TO MEXICO AMID HOPES, FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beyond the communal cornfield where Silvia Alfaro learned to plant seed as 
soon as she could walk, the highland valley exploded in a brilliant blaze of 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 From one ridgeline to the next, as far as the eye could see, jagged plots of 
maiz dominated the hard, black earth. 
</P>
<P>
 And from the north, storm clouds swept across the land, quenching the thirst 
of the arid fields and leaving a trail of rainbows over this mountainous region 
in southern Mexico, inhabited by the "people of the clouds." 
</P>
<P>
 Surveying this landscape for the first time in years, Alfaro knew that there 
was no place like home. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly life in the United States had never looked as good, she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 She had slipped into the country illegally nearly five years ago, 15 years old 
and newly married in a union brokered by her parents. Her husband beat her, she 
said, and she eventually left him only to end up broke and alone, 2,000 miles 
from home. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked the toughest, lowest-paying farm jobs in Oxnard. But when voters 
approved Proposition 187, she gave up trying to make it in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sick with worry that each contact with a doctor or a police officer would end 
in deportation and separation from her children, Alfaro chose to return to 
Santiago Asuncion, a poverty-choked pueblo in her native state of Oaxaca. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to leave before it got any worse," she said. "No one knows what 
it's like to live in fear, to be afraid to wait for the bus or go to the 
market. I won't have to worry about those things anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Alfaro gathered her two boys and her life's belongings and hopped a 
bus for the pilgrimage to her homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the grueling 30-hour journey behind her, she stood at the lip of 
this golden valley, sure this is where she belonged. The rainbows were an omen, 
she said, a sign that her decision to return had been a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's magical, like a dream," she said. "I can't believe I'm home." The 
Journey Home 
</P>
<P>
 The long journey home began at 7 a.m. at a bus depot on the outskirts of 
downtown Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 A charter bus warmed its engine, preparing to deliver Alfaro and her two boys 
-- Adrian, 3, and Eduardo, 4 months -- to a depot in Los Angeles. Another bus 
would take them across the border, and yet another to the Tijuana airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix Rubio, Alfaro's fiance and the father of her youngest child, loaded her 
baggage into the belly of the coach. There wasn't much, considering it was all 
she owned. 
</P>
<P>
 She had sold many of her belongings to lighten the load and help pay for the 
trip home. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio, who is also an illegal immigrant, planned to go to Minneapolis after 
Alfaro's departure, a place rumored to have plenty of work. They would like to 
stay together, but there is no work where Alfaro is going. 
</P>
<P>
 So Rubio will work in the United States and send money when he gets it. Alfaro 
will live with her parents -- and four of her brothers and sisters -- so there 
will be no rent to pay. Her father said he would support her and the boys even 
if Rubio never sends a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus slipped onto the Ventura Freeway, slicing past rows of emerald 
farmland being worked by stoop laborers. It lurched through heavy traffic in 
Los Angeles and then Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro stared out the window, considering her decision to leave a man who had 
finally treated her with some decency. She also considered how she could have 
stayed with another man who treated her so badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly five years ago, Alfaro joined the stream of migrant laborers that flows 
out of Santiago Asuncion each year to work Oxnard's strawberry crop before 
surging farther north. 
</P>
<P>
 She had only been married three days, and hadn't known when she repeated her 
vows that she was signing on for a trip to el norte. Unlike others in Santiago 
Asuncion, she never really wanted to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I thought at least over there it would be very beautiful and that you 
would never suffer," said Alfaro, now 20. "I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The suffering set in quickly. She and her husband slept three nights in 
Oxnard's Del Sol Park, unable to find work or a place to stay. They borrowed 
money and rented one of the many garages that double as apartments in the 
city's La Colonia barrio. 
</P>
<P>
 When she did find work, she labored for as little as $10 a day. Marital 
Problems 
</P>
<P>
 The marital problems also set in. Her husband beat her often, Alfaro declared 
in documents filed in Ventura County Superior Court during a custody dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 He once punched her in the eye and kicked her in the stomach when she was 
pregnant, the court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had no telephone, not that it mattered. Alfaro had no one to call. 
She said her husband tore up letters she wrote to her father begging him to 
come to her rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw people when they got married, how beautiful they were in their white 
dresses, eating cake," she said. "What they don't tell you is that it's only 
beautiful for that one day." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually she escaped, running away in the middle of the night. She was poor 
and alone but she endured, grabbing hold of the American dream as if it were a 
life preserver. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Proposition 187, approved overwhelmingly by voters in November. Its 
aim was to drive out illegal immigrants such as herself. Given all she had put 
up with in the United States, she didn't need much of a push. 
</P>
<P>
 She thought of following Rubio to Minneapolis, where there is no such law. Or 
staying put, as most other illegal immigrants are doing, awaiting the outcome 
of court rulings that so far have delayed implementation of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, so consumed by fear that she rarely ventured outdoors, she 
decided it was best to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired of hiding, of feeling unwanted in this country," she said. "If 
everything here was really so good, I wouldn't have to go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the bus was barreling down the Golden State Freeway, Alfaro had 
turned her mind to other things. 
</P>
<P>
 She was intrigued by the idea that once across the border she no longer would 
be "an illegal." She didn't even notice the U. S. Border Patrol agents swarming 
around the international boundary when the bus rumbled into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents didn't notice her either. They could not have cared less about 
people heading south. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tijuana airport was a busy place filled with busy people flying home for 
the holidays. They wrapped their arms around suitcases and boxes jammed with 
Christmas gifts. With all the people, it was hard for Alfaro to find her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe Vivar, 44, and a legal resident of the United States, would 
accompany his daughter the rest of the way home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20 years since Vivar first left Santiago Asuncion to find work, he has 
returned to his village every year around this time. 
</P>
<P>
 But this trip was special. Not only was his oldest daughter going home for 
good, but he would finally meet his youngest daughter, a 3-month-old born while 
he was away. The baby would be named once he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Alfaro was in her father's arms, she lost all doubts about her decision. 
Automatically, they slipped into the native tongue of their Mixteca region, a 
tonal language that skips and dances on air. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plane from Tijuana to Mexico City, they swapped stories. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they were forced to wait seven hours in a Mexico City bus station for 
the next bus to Oaxaca, they talked through the night, bridging the years of 
separation with their words. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bus the next day, Alfaro said her father had told her that for all her 
suffering, it was a pity she returned home with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the bus arrived at Huajuapam de Leon, Alfaro and Vivar were less 
than a two-hour taxi ride from home. Loading their luggage in a tiny car, they 
set off through the hills, rounding curve after curve on a narrow, two-lane 
mountain road. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Alfaro recognized landmarks. A magnificent, hillside cathedral was the 
same distance from her town as Oxnard is from Ventura, she said excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, 30 hours after she started, Alfaro was home. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the main road, the taxi bumped along a rutted dirt road, its tires 
crunching to a stop in front of a two-story block house. The structure is one 
of the best in the village, a testament to years of sacrifice in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go there, we sacrifice seeing our families, not because we want to," Vivar 
said. "We go there because there is no other way." New Troubles Ahead 
</P>
<P>
 This time of year, laborers return en masse to Santiago Asuncion, a pueblo of 
about 1,600 people in the Mixteca region in western Oaxaca. 
</P>
<P>
 They come home for the holidays and to celebrate the fiesta of Guadalupe, the 
village's patron saint. They come to get to know their families all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few months, when the tide of laborers drains back to the north, the 
town's population will be half that size. 
</P>
<P>
 This is sure to happen. Because in Santiago Asuncion, as in the rest of this 
region of indigenous Indian people, the peasant farmers hold fast to some hard 
truths. 
</P>
<P>
 Before northern migration from Oaxaca began in earnest in the mid-1970s, 
Santiago Asuncion was a village of palm huts and tin-roof shacks. Tucked deep 
in a poor pocket of one of Mexico's poorest states, it had little work and less 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 But nurtured by U. S. dollars, it has progressed over the years into a 
collection of concrete block houses, many sprouting satellite dishes and 
television antennas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people now have enough to eat regardless of whether there is enough rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything you see here, everything that is modern and new, was built with 
American dollars," said Pedro Mendez, a legal immigrant who recently returned 
to the pueblo after nearly a year of working the fields in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of progress has not been cheap, however. Many villagers say they go 
months, even years, without seeing their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress has exacted another toll, as well. The local school used to have six 
teachers; now, it has three because so few children remain. The town used to 
have a municipal band, but most of the musicians also have gone north. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the native language is vanishing, shoved aside by the more widely used 
Spanish. After all, what good is a language that U. S. employers can't 
understand? 
</P>
<P>
 In Santiago Asuncion, as in other indigenous communities, villagers say they 
have little choice but to head north. 
</P>
<P>
 The desolate Mixteca region, home to more than 1,000 mountain pueblos, has no 
economic base to support its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Without arable land to grow food -- and with water in short supply -- the men, 
women and teen-age children of this area say they must migrate for work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no work here, no opportunity," said Serafin Vivar, the 64-year-old 
patriarch of the family. "That's just the way it is. It is the only way we can 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there is something about this town, some unspoken obedience to the call 
of the land of their birth, that keeps the residents returning year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the same call that ultimately brought Alfaro back home. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate her homecoming, her family slaughtered a goat, skinning it and 
roasting its various parts in an earthen barbecue pit. They hugged her and 
kissed her and told her how good it was to have her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy now," cried her mother, Dominga Vivar. "I cried many times because 
she was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Then they put her to work. She busied herself in the kitchen -- a dirt-floor 
hut not attached to the main house -- making giant corn tortillas over a 
wood-burning stove. 
</P>
<P>
 All the food is made from scratch. Alfaro said she will miss Taco Bell and 
Pizza Hut the most. She said she will also miss bathrooms and supermarkets, 
stoves and running water. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping into Santiago Asuncion is like stepping back in time. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of its recent advancement into the modern era, the pueblo remains in 
many ways the village it was decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one telephone in town. No indoor plumbing. Its dirt roads, rutted and 
scarred by deep fissures, are more often jammed with goats and burros than with 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The town centers around an ancient church -- some say as many as five 
centuries old -- where villagers exercise their faith. In the evening, 
youngsters play basketball in the town plaza while men sit around sipping 
Superior beer, warm and flat and 24 to the box. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day the storm clouds rolled across the golden valley, Alfaro helped her 
grandfather move corn into his tin-roof shack. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where she lived until she was 11, before her father ventured to the 
United States and earned enough money to build the family's two-story block 
structure closer to the center of town. So Many Changes 
</P>
<P>
 So much has changed since that time. The town has grown up, so much so that 
few of the old tin-roof huts remain. And even though she has just left some old 
problems behind, she knows that new troubles lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 She has returned to her village without the man she married, and in a small 
town, that is not a good thing, especially for a woman. She was embarrassed to 
leave her house the first few days, afraid of what people might say. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the things she gave up by coming home. In Santiago Asuncion, 
there is only an elementary school and the nearest doctor is 30 minutes away. 
In the United States, because her boys are citizens, they could have received 
an advanced education and regular access to medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about it over and over again. It wasn't easy," she said, the rain 
now tapping a dance against the tin roof. "Over there, my children would have 
been educated, they would have been able to go to the doctor. They would have 
had everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wanted to be with my family. I just decided there was no sense being 
over there, suffering and all alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, she knows that despite the often rancorous debate about borders 
and immigration, her homecoming is an isolated incident, one that goes upstream 
against the flow of Mexican immigration, legal and illegal, across the 
international boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 And she expects that one day her sons will join the migrant stream to the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what happens in this town," she said. "That's what people do. When 
they are old enough, they leave."

SOME WARY OF ADVISERS FOR STADIUM; SPORTS: CONSULTANTS WORKED ON A 
DISAPPOINTING BALLPARK IN LAKE ELSINORE. BACKERS OF LOCAL PROJECT STAND BY 
THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city leaders in tiny Lake Elsinore dreamed of a ballpark that would draw 
tourists and merchants and revive their sleepy town. They got that when the 
Lake Elsinore Diamond opened this year to sellout crowds eager to see minor 
league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Council members never expected they would receive only about $350,000 
a year on an annual investment of nearly $1.9 million. Or that the stadium 
would end up costing three times what their consultants had predicted, draining 
the city coffers and prompting a grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now three cities in Ventura County are considering a similar project and using 
the same consultants, former Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young and his partner, 
Brian J. Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium's backers in Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura say they are fully 
aware of the ballooning costs that plagued the Lake Elsinore Diamond in 
Riverside County, but express confidence the same problems will not arise here. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some city staffers are concerned that the consultants, the Spectrum Group, 
have a vested interest in making a proposed $15.6-million stadium become 
reality, since they may profit from the ballpark here -- as they now do in Lake 
Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
 In an October memo, the finance directors of Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura 
advised their city managers to hire an independent adviser to review the 
consultant's study. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reason: The consultant has offered to run the proposed 5,500-seat 
ballpark if it is built -- similar to its arrangement with Lake Elsinore -- and 
therefore has a clear motive in seeing the project move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that it was a good idea to have someone else come in and look at it," 
said Camarillo finance director Anita Bingham. "They would have no vested 
interest in it, and the Spectrum Group did."  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the cities have no plans to commission an independent study on the 
stadium proposal. "Until someone says they're wrong, I don't think we need to 
do any studies to verify what they have told us," Camarillo City Manager Bill 
Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their only previous experience with a stadium project, the consultants 
advised Lake Elsinore that the ballpark would cost the city only $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lake Elsinore Diamond ended up costing more than $24 million, forcing the 
city of 22,000 to dip into its reserve fund, transfer money from ongoing 
projects, and postpone needed improvements -- such as cleaning Lake Elsinore 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for its $24-million investment, the city receives just $50,000 
annually in rent from the team, the Class A Lake Elsinore Storm, and a small 
percentage of revenues from box seat and reserve ticket sales, parking, 
concessions and baseball souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For this year, its honeymoon season, the Storm is expected to pay Lake 
Elsinore only about $350,000 despite record-setting attendance -- far short of 
the estimated $1 million the city spent just to run the ballpark and maintain 
its surroundings, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not include the $900,000 the city must pay annually for 25 years to 
retire the bonds for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 A large chunk of the city's money goes to the Spectrum Group, which receives 
$600,000 a year to manage the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballpark could enhance plans Young and Myers had previously advanced for a 
massive, $2-billion resort community next to the stadium that would include 
9,000 homes, golf courses, hotels and shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Young defended his firm's handling of the stadium project, blaming cost 
overruns on failed promises by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the price went up because the infrastructure off site was not 
there," Young said in a recent interview. "Sewers, roads, things the city said 
would be there. That had everything to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Lake Elsinore's council members now admit they made a mistake by using 
public money to pay for their stadium -- not expected to make a profit for at 
least 10 years, if ever -- and they are advising the Ventura County communities 
to beware of baseball hype. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame when a team can sell out a project and we're still losing 
money," said Lake Elsinore Councilman George Alongi, an early proponent of the 
city's stadium who opposed it once costs began escalating. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's Little, a member of the tri-cities committee working on the 
ballpark plan, said he sees no reason to double-check the Spectrum Group's 
estimates for the stadium proposed in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant hired a variety of local firms to perform its study, and the 
subcontractors understood the costs of building in Ventura County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the cities do not have to hire the Spectrum Group to run their 
stadium, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they have an interest in having the project move forward," Little 
said. "But we have never agreed to engage them in anything other than what we 
have to. . . . We're not going to hand this off to anybody just because they 
are there. I'm sure there will be other bidders." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Spectrum Group has not submitted a formal, written offer to operate the 
proposed Ventura stadium and may opt not to do so despite repeated oral offers, 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lake Elsinore, however, the only bidders to run the ballpark were the city, 
the Spectrum Group and the construction firm that built the ballpark, Alongi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to build a stadium in Ventura County began in January, when 
representatives from Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura met to discuss luring a 
minor league baseball franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members and city managers from the three cities visited several minor 
league ballparks, concluding that the facilities were becoming a major draw.  
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting in the spring, Joe Gagliardi, president of the Class A California 
League of Professional Baseball, assured them that if they built a stadium, 
they would receive a team. At the same meeting, Young made an elaborate 
presentation, including slides and graphics detailing what Lake Elsinore and 
other communities had done. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, the cities chose Young's Spectrum Group to guide their plans. 
One of three bidders, the group was picked for its experience with projects in 
Lake Elsinore and Rancho Cucamonga, city officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the consultant's principal members, Young and Myers, had nothing to 
do with the Rancho Cucamonga stadium: A subcontractor they hired helped build 
the facility; hence their connection to the project, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the cities have paid the Spectrum Group $85,000 to determine if the 
ballpark is worth building, to find a possible site and to help create a 
funding plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step of the plan, which would require the cities to pay the 
consultant $435,000, remains on hold while members of the tri-cities baseball 
committee look for private contributions to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Their fund-raising campaign, which includes Jim Colburn, a former major league 
pitcher and a Santa Paula native, is still under way. Its results have not been 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of private funding collected may decide the fate of the plan: The 
Camarillo City Council has vowed not to spend another dime on the project and, 
without private support, the city may drop out of the stadium drive altogether, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its study, the Spectrum Group concluded that Ventura County was an ideal 
place for a minor league stadium and helped select the proposed site, a barren 
field near the Ventura Auto Center. The cities then agreed to accept Ventura as 
the ballpark's location. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant has also suggested that the cities pay for the stadium by 
forming a joint powers authority and issuing bonds -- a plan that has been 
embraced by the committee pushing the facility but has yet to be approved by 
the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the Spectrum Group has determined that a Ventura County stadium 
would probably not recoup its operating costs for six years, and like the Lake 
Elsinore Diamond might never pay for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But as it did in Lake Elsinore, the consultant argues that the cities would 
receive indirect economic benefits that would far outweigh their costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructing the stadium alone would generate $10.1 million and 115 jobs in 
Ventura County, according to the Spectrum Group's study. And once it opened, 
the ballpark would generate $19.7 million in economic activity every year, 
along with 357 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, Tere Cherveny, a former Lake Elsinore councilwoman who stepped down 
this summer, said that Young made the same claims in her city and they failed 
to materialize.  
</P>
<P>
 "They hired a bunch of kids for $4.25 an hour" to help with construction, said 
Cherveny, who also was city treasurer before being elected to the council. 
"Those are not real jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Alongi said Lake Elsinore has not seen the influx of economic 
activity after the stadium was built that Young had predicted.  
</P>
<P>
 "What do (businesses) do when the minor league is not in town?" Alongi said. 
"The team is only here five months a year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lake Elsinore City Atty. John Harper said the city has received a 
substantial economic boost from the stadium. Companies like Red Lion Hotels and 
Inns Inc., which wants to build a major hotel and conference center by the 
lake, are now expressing interest in the once-sleepy town, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really changed the attitude of the community," Harper said. "One point 
that people seem to overlook is that 350,000 people went through Lake Elsinore 
(to the games), and that helped our local businesses get out of what has been a 
tough time."  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Riverside County grand jury released a scathing report this 
month on its probe into the financing and construction of the Lake Elsinore 
Diamond. It calls for an independent audit of the activities of the Lake 
Elsinore Redevelopment Agency, which funded the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The interim report concludes that the project's construction was accelerated 
so the stadium could open in time for the 1994 season -- an unnecessary 
restriction that contributed to the rising costs, as crews had to work around 
the clock to meet the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spectrum Group has placed a similar timeline on the Ventura County 
stadium, insisting that it must open by the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside grand jury also found that change orders to the original plan 
led to cost overruns of as high as $10 million. Young said that the city, not 
the consultant, was to blame for the escalating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said he had not seen the grand jury report. "All I know is that the City 
Council, the city manager and the city attorney said the report was ridiculous 
and riddled with inaccuracies," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Elsinore officials would not comment on the report, other than to say it 
is factually incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford said he had not heard about a grand jury 
investigation of the financing of the Lake Elsinore Diamond, but had learned of 
the cost overruns from residents there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still he said the Spectrum Group has always been forthright about its economic 
interests and the fact that a Ventura stadium would never break even. 
</P>
<P>
 "My general impression is that no one was trying to pull the wool over the 
councils," Buford said. "I think the purpose of the (Spectrum Group study) was 
on as reasonable a budget as possible to examine these plans, and I think we 
received a lot of information." 
</P>
<P>
 Buford said Ventura residents have expressed strong support for a stadium in 
the city, and he will continue to study the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Alongi said he had a word of advice for the Ventura County cities, 
as they continue to pursue plans for a ballpark: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that minor league is bad," he said. Minor league is good, and 
it's good family entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
 "But no matter what happens, the ball team will never make the money" to pay 
for the stadium, he said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "The public can get stuck paying for this for 25 to 30 years."

VENTURA'S CLASSROOM ON WHEELS LETS ADULT STUDENTS FEEL AT HOME; EDUCATION: 
SCHOOL USES 32-FOOT-LONG TRAILER TO BRING COURSES IN ENGLISH AND COMPUTERS TO 
THOSE WHO LACK TRANSPORTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pulling a red-and-white checked apron from a closet, teacher Karen Greenslate 
told her four students she wanted to practice pronouncing a word that often 
trips up people learning English: "Isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me," Greenslate said, acting out a dialogue from the group's English 
textbook. "That's my apron." 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Socorro Tovar said as she clutched the apron Greenslate still held 
tightly. "It isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Greenslate said, pulling the apron away from Tovar. "It is." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the five women, who were crowded around a small linoleum-topped table, 
chuckled at their own antics. 
</P>
<P>
 If the atmosphere around this table seems more like a cozy chat among friends 
than a formal class in English, it's meant to. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenslate, an instructor for the Ventura Adult School, teaches her classes in 
a 32-foot-long mobile home the adult school has remodeled into a small 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the front of the trailer is a small, built-in table where students gather 
for English classes and other group work. At the back, the district has ripped 
out the trailer's beds and installed shiny new countertops and chairs that 
serve as desks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other adult schools around the state operate such mobile learning 
centers, the Ventura Unified School District is the first in Ventura County to 
offer drive-up service. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the district launched the program this fall, Greenslate and teacher's 
aide Sandy Serrano have been taking their mobile classroom to three Ventura 
Unified School District elementary schools -- Sheridan Way, Montalvo and 
Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parking in front of the schools, the educators open the trailer door to any 
adult who wants to master English, learn the basics of computers or work toward 
a high school degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the ideas in adult education is to bring education to the learner," 
Ventura Adult School administrator Virginia Donnellan said. "We were trying to 
break down some of the barriers of why adult learners are not coming to our 
established campuses, and one of them is transportation. Some of them just 
don't have transportation." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the adult school already offers free courses in English, computer 
basics and other subjects at numerous sites around the Ventura district, many 
adults are without cars to drive to the classes, Donnellan said. 
</P>
<P>
 And some women lack access to the family car during class hours because their 
husbands drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students, also mainly women, may be unable to leave their families alone 
during the evenings when many of the adult school's regular classes are 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
 For such parents, attending classes during the same hours their children are 
in school and even at the same place is both convenient and reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're real comfortable with the idea that their kids are right there in the 
building," Greenslate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of the mobile classroom's convenient schedule and locations, 
nearly all of the 60 adults who have signed up so far for classes are women, 
Greenslate said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the traveling classroom offers another advantage that may appeal 
particularly to women: It's homey. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of people taking courses at the mobile classroom have been out of 
school for 10 or 15 years, adult school officials said. For such returning 
students, a formal classroom can feel intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small learning environment," Donnellan said. "It's comfortable. . . . 
I think the students themselves feel they can support each other in a smaller 
learning environment, whereas they might not feel they can support each other 
in a classroom of 30 students." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are students able to support one another, they get more individual 
attention from instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the trailer able to hold only seven students at a time, Greenslate may 
hold an English lesson with four people at one end of the trailer while Serrano 
teaches three others how to operate laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The one exception to these tiny classes is at Sheridan Way, where so many 
parents have signed up for English courses that Greenslate gives the lessons in 
a room at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the mobile learning center comes as no surprise to Cecilia 
Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
 A 26-year-old mother of five youngsters who all attend Montalvo, Mendez said 
she heard about the traveling classroom from one of her children's teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Employed by a firm that inventories goods at department stores, Mendez said 
she is eager to learn basic computer skills that will help her at work. "I want 
to know more so I don't have to go in there so confused all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 But she is too busy to attend the regularly scheduled adult school classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of the mobile classroom, Mendez said, is it serves as a 
traveling advertisement to parents who may feel trapped in their present jobs 
or unable to find work. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents don't know they can go to Ventura Adult School," she said. 
"They think they don't have any other options. It helps them to realize they 
have other options."

CHARITIES RELY ON CREATIVE FUND-RAISING; PHILANTHROPY: NONPROFIT GROUPS TURN TO 
ENTREPRENEURIAL METHODS OF OBTAINING MONEY AS DONATIONS DECLINE.

 As the holiday season kicks into high gear, a Thousand Oaks charity that 
provides counseling for the terminally ill is selling Christmas tree ornaments 
in a busy mall for $15. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, a clinic that offers low-cost health care is crafting and 
selling holiday gift baskets that fetch up to $55. 
</P>
<P>
 An Oxnard shelter for homeless men is operating two thriving thrift stores, 
using the profits to serve 10,850 free meals this month alone. 
</P>
<P>
 And the United Way, seizing on the public's concern over crime, has recently 
vowed to funnel more dollars to groups that aim to prevent child abuse and gang 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, leaders of nonprofit groups say, Ventura County charities are 
turning to new and entrepreneurial ways to raise money to make up for donations 
that have declined in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The lingering recession has made individuals more discriminating about where 
they will donate hard-earned dollars, they say, and charities have learned they 
can no longer rely solely on traditional methods of raising money, such as 
making direct appeals for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding is too unpredictable under that formula, charities say. An informal 
sampling of nonprofit groups in Ventura County last week, for example, revealed 
that some charities are experiencing higher-than-normal donations as Christmas 
approaches, while others have seen a slight downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ideal situation for charities today is to get at least 80% of your 
funding from entrepreneurial efforts," said Frances Prince, executive director 
of Conejo Valley Senior Concerns. "That makes you less dependent on the general 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The trend toward creative fund-raising is a national one, and it was not 
triggered solely by an ailing economy, said Berta Steele, an administrator with 
the Ventura County Community Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 With 40,000 tax-exempt charities established nationwide in 1993 alone, there 
is increasing competition for dollars, said Steele, who heads up an information 
clearinghouse for nonprofit groups in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the need for social services has increased because of the 
poor economy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, charities that have been around for a decade or more have 
matured and become more sophisticated in their approach to fund-raising, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to stand out, you need to be creative when asking for money," Steele 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although philanthropic groups have long used such tactics as auctioning gift 
items and holding gala dinners to augment donations, today's enterprises tend 
to be more business-oriented and complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Senior Concerns, for example, started a program this year called 
"Utilipay." 
</P>
<P>
 In contracts with General Telephone, Southern California Edison, Ventura 
County Cablevision and Southern California Gas Co., the charity has agreed to 
collect utility payments at the Goebel Center, a seniors' building in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the utilities pay the charity 30 cents for each bill collected. 
Executive Director Prince said the enterprise is expected to contribute $20,000 
to the center's $542,000 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession has caused donations to drop by 20% over the past two years, 
Prince said. Utilipay will help make up the difference, allowing the group to 
continue its programs of hot meals, counseling and recreational activities for 
about 1,800 seniors each year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things like this are the wave of the future for charities," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some revenue-raisers are much simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hospice of the Conejo presents its "Tree of Life" each holiday season, 
said director Grethe Rivera. For $15, shoppers in The Oaks mall in Thousand 
Oaks can buy Christmas lights or ornamental stars, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decorations are placed on a Christmas tree in the mall in memory of 
someone who has died, she said. People have been very generous this year, 
Rivera said, and the fund-raiser will help raise thousands for the hospice's 
$170,000 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when we thought we might have to shut our doors," Rivera 
said. "We feel good that we have been able to go through hard times and 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Simi Valley Free Clinic, volunteers are making baskets filled with 
chocolates and teas and selling them through direct mail advertising, said Fred 
Bauermeister, executive director of the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The gifts can also be purchased at selected businesses in Simi Valley, 
Bauermeister said. In the past, the group would get people to donate baskets 
and would then auction them off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the clinic's board of directors learned that making them in-house and 
selling them directly worked better. Fewer volunteers were needed and the cost 
of renting a banquet room was eliminated, Bauermeister said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing it this way is more efficient," he said. "So in the long run, it will 
be more profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Bauermeister said he expects to sell $3,000 worth of the baskets by Christmas. 
That is a significant chunk of the clinic's $80,000 annual budget, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all new fund-raising efforts have such a capitalist bent. The United Way, 
which makes grants to 55 social and health service agencies throughout Ventura 
County, has opted to narrow its focus after donors said they want more say in 
where the agency distributes funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at United Way last month announced a plan to increase the money they 
allocate for child abuse and gang violence, top concerns listed by Ventura 
County residents in a survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The charity's leaders hope that by focusing its efforts, people will be more 
apt to contribute. The Community Foundation's Steele predicted that such 
market-oriented strategies will continue in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to see more of it as nonprofits become more sophisticated in 
their approach," she said. "And it is a promising trend, because everybody 
wins."

SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PLAYS SANTA; CHARITY: AT ANNUAL GIVEAWAY, ALMOST 500 
CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS RECEIVE CHRISTMAS DONATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If there was one moment that made the last three months of work and 
preparation worthwhile for Robin Estes, it may have been when 7-year-old 
Richard Hamblin speechlessly, tightly clutched a new handmade toy biplane -- 
almost as if he couldn't believe that someone would actually give him such a 
wonderful gift for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 But someone did. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard and almost 500 other needy children received toys from volunteers with 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department during its 13th annual "Share-Iffs" 
food and toy distribution in Ventura on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes, a department radio dispatcher, has done most of the organizing for the 
annual event since she and her fellow dispatchers first decided to spread some 
holiday cheer to residents down on their luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirteen years ago we were sitting around and said we should do something for 
needy families this Christmas," Estes said. "It started with us going through 
Los Robles hospital handing out gifts on Christmas Eve to about 20 people. This 
year we sent out boxes of food to about 150 families, and gifts for about 500 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The families were picked by Catholic Charities, the county's Children's 
Protective Services and patrol officers, Estes said. Some of the parents have 
lost their jobs, or have children with devastating illnesses, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Each family's name was taken down, their children's names were carefully 
recorded, and some kids were even asked what they wanted for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 First in a line of more than 60 families waiting at the Sheriff's Department 
headquarters in Ventura Friday night, 13-year-old Carlos Renteria said he asked 
for a bike. 
</P>
<P>
 As the time approached when the doors would be opened and the gifts handed 
out, Carlos -- barely able to contain himself -- jogged in place with 
anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, check out the bikes in there," he said to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finally was allowed to walk inside, volunteers from the department 
wheeled over a shiny red three-speed, and he quickly took hold of the 
handlebars. His mother received a box of food with a turkey, eggs, bread and 
enough fixings for a large Christmas dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," was all Carlos' mother kept repeating. Carlos just beamed.  
</P>
<P>
 Estes was not alone in her efforts. She got a lot of help from the other 
dispatchers, who wrapped gifts into the wee hours of their night shifts, and 
she said she had more than enough deputies volunteering to play Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all wanted to be Santa," Estes said. "I think the guys want to be Santa 
because they see the need out their all the time. This gives them a chance to 
do something to help, plus they feel appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
 Estes was able to get donations of toys from the Disney Co., along with 
in-line skates made by the Variflex Co. in Moorpark, and toy wooden planes, 
cars and rocking horses made by inmates at the county's Ojai Honor Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 60 families that came to the department's Ventura headquarters, 
dozens of families received gifts in Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo and 
Thousand Oaks as department volunteers fanned out to deliver the goods 
door-to-door. Ventura County Sheriff Larry Carpenter, who stopped by after 
handing out toys at a similar event in Saticoy, said the annual toy drive was a 
resounding success. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the kids see deputies out there in uniform next to Santa, or singing 
carols, they get a real family feeling," he said. "They see that we're all part 
of the same community and I think that's important."  
</P>
<P>
 There were a few glitches, such as when the drivers could not find the Barela 
family's house. Since their father, a truck driver at Calmat, has been out on 
strike, times have been tough. His two sons Craig, 8, and Cody, 4, waited for 
three hours on the front porch for the truck delivering the toys. The family 
finally had to come in to pick up their gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were a little worried they weren't going to get anything this 
year," said their mother, Joanne Barela, as Cody happily attacked the wrapping 
paper on his gift.

BREA MALL SHOPPERS EVACUATED IN BOMB HOAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of Christmas shoppers were evacuated from the northern wing of the 
Brea Mall Saturday afternoon after authorities received an anonymous bomb 
threat and discovered a "suspicious" package. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests or injuries were reported from the incident, which turned out to be 
a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
 The scare at the 180-store mall came after similar evacuations were made at 
malls in Glendale and Carson recently. The Glendale incident Wednesday proved 
to be a hoax, but authorities disposed of a bomb found in the Carson Mall Dec. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea police could not say Saturday whether the three incidents were related. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't rule it out," said Police Lt. Douglas Dickerson. "There's no reason 
to suspect a connection, but this kind of thing is very easy to copy." 
</P>
<P>
 About noon, Brea police received a 911 telephone call claiming "multiple 
bombs" were stashed in the mall, Dickerson said. Police and mall security soon 
discovered a "suspicious package" in the Robinsons-May department store and 
began herding shoppers and employees from a 20-store area about 2:30 p.m., 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us to drop everything and leave the building," said Andy Pence, 19, 
who works at Sbarro's Italian Eatery in the nearby food court. "It was kind of 
exciting. Hardly anything ever happens around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds gathered outside as the Orange County Sheriff's Department bomb squad 
examined the package. After bomb squad officials determined the item was not a 
bomb, stores were reopened and shoppers were allowed inside the mall by 3:15 
p.m, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a significant evacuation," Dickerson said. "We would have preferred 
not to move anyone, especially with Christmas shopping, but we wanted to be 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Mall officials did not expect the evacuation would cut into vital holiday 
sales. Most of the mall, about 160 other stores, remained open during the 
incident, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really shouldn't have much of an effect on sales," said the mall General 
Manager Don Ford. "That's really not an issue though. The safety of our 
customers comes first." 
</P>
<P>
 Most afternoon shoppers appeared unaware of the bomb scare.

FEARFUL OF WHAT'S UP ABOVE; CHURCH WORRIES IT WOULD LOSE OLD-FASHIONED AURA TO 
AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the F/A-18 Hornets thunder into the sky from nearby El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station, the deafening roar of jet engines is actually reassuring to the 
Rev. Dennis Sherman of Irvine Community Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine jets, Sherman notes, "never fly on Sunday," whereas, if the base is 
ever converted to a commercial airport, the constant noise would spell disaster 
for his church. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, 47, is the pastor of Irvine's first church, founded in 1932 for 
agricultural workers on the Irvine Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 In an age of television evangelism and celebrity churches, the small, 
nondenominational congregation quietly focuses on a scholarly study of the 
Bible, examining it "book by book, verse by verse," Sherman said. And 
churchgoers still sit on the stiff, wooden seats that were purchased from a 
defunct Santa Ana theater when the church was built in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certain a church can have a modern building and still have the old 
values," Sherman says. "But people see this church and right away they think of 
the old values." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday services were first held in a two-room schoolhouse on Sand Canyon 
Drive, about two miles south of the church's current location. In October, 
1951, construction of the existing Spanish-style church was completed on land 
donated by James Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by vegetable fields and rows of sycamore trees planted long ago to 
protect crops from the wind, the diminutive church is one of the few historic 
buildings left in a city that incorporated only 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the entrance to the El Toro Marine base is less than a mile away, and in 
the wake of county voter approval of a commercial airport at the base there is 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "A commercial airport would have flights all the time and the traffic would be 
terrible," said Sherman, pastor of the church since 1968. "It could make it 
impossible for the church to function at this location." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman worries that if the church is forced to move because of noise and 
traffic from a commercial airport at El Toro, the community will lose more than 
a building, it will lose the city's last vestige of small-town America. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the "Bible-teaching church" is a refuge from the upwardly mobile 
lifestyle of Irvine and surrounding communities. Every Sunday night, the 
congregation gathers together for a potluck supper after the evening service. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the larger churches, it was too impersonal," says Irvine resident Cindy 
Lance, who attends Irvine Community Church with her husband, Mike, and their 
two children. "It's more of a family unit here. If we're missing from church on 
the weekend, we get a call from the assistant pastor, who says, 'I hope you 
guys are OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Community Church was founded by the American Sunday School Union, later 
renamed American Missionary Fellowship.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization dates to the late 1700s when it sent missionaries to 
accompany pioneers on their way West after the Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman was a senior at Biola University in La Mirada when the American Sunday 
School Union asked him to conduct services for the Irvine church's dwindling 
congregation. There were 12 people there on his first Sunday in September, 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, about 125 of the congregation's 200 members come to Sunday 
services on average. 
</P>
<P>
 The church will lose about 60 members, who are from the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station, when the base closes in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 John Neel, 48, assistant pastor, joined the church one year ago after retiring 
from a 29-year career in the Marine Corps. He began attending the Irvine 
Community Church while stationed at the El Toro Marine base and he is now 
studying for a master's degree in specialized ministries at the Talbot Seminary 
in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 Neel says part of the charm of the church is its relative anonymity, with its 
site on the outskirts of east Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I do wonder out of the 110,000 people who live in Irvine, how many 
know there's something this old in their community?" Neel says. "We've all come 
to love this church -- we'd hate to leave."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
DORNAN COMMEMORATES BATTLE WHILE COUNTY'S FIGHTING OFF CREDITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Off to Europe: As the financial world collapses around Orange County, where is 
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove)? He shipped off last week to Europe, 
apparently as a guest of the secretary of the Army, for ceremonies 
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan's aides went ballistic when it was suggested he might be needed at home 
during these increasingly dark days for the county. After all, Sen. Barbara 
Boxer (D-Calif.) came to the county to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done everything Orange County has asked us to do," said Joe Eule, 
Dornan's chief of staff in Washington. "For people to suggest we are ignoring 
the situation is flat out wrong. This really isn't a federal matter, and there 
really isn't a lot we can do anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another first: Much has been made of the gains made by Latinos in November's 
local elections. In Santa Ana, Miguel A. Pulido Jr. became the county seat's 
first Latino mayor, while in Anaheim and San Clemente, Lou Lopez and Steve 
Apodaca, respectively, each became his city's first-ever Latino councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 But another landmark for diversity in Orange County occurred in Lake Forest, 
where Kathy McCullough became the first African American elected to a City 
Council, according to records kept by the League of Cities. McCullough, who 
runs the Adopt-A-Neighbor food bank in Mission Viejo, said her ethnicity was 
never a part of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't run because I am black or because I am a woman," McCullough said. "I 
ran because my neighbors asked me to run and then put their trust in me as 
their representative." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stalemate City: Anaheim's four City Council members -- two of whom were 
elected on Nov. 8 -- have waxed eloquent in the last few weeks about how they 
intend to work together. But, so far at least, nothing could be further from 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first meeting last month, the panel couldn't agree on how to increase 
golf course fees at the two municipal golf courses, despite the fact the plan 
would raise city revenue by $160,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last week, council members deadlocked on who should fill a vacant seat 
on the council, with a 2-2 tie on a motion to appoint third-place finisher 
Shirley McCracken. If no decision is made by late January, the city will have 
to hold a special election at a cost of $100,000. With that election unlikely 
before June, council-watchers fear it could be a cold, indecisive winter for 
important city issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could mean total paralysis," said former councilwoman Miriam Kaywood. 
"There is no way that this city would be able to function during the most 
crucial time that this city has ever been through." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gil and Paul: Local Republicans have heaped part of the blame for the 
defection of Assemblyman Paul Horcher (I-Diamond Bar) on former Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson. They say Horcher's recent decision to become an independent and vote 
for Willie Brown over Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) as Speaker of the 
Assembly was based on Ferguson's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson acknowledges that he told Horcher to get the best deal he could get. 
He also said he doesn't blame Horcher, who was reelected Nov. 8 as a 
Republican, for turning his back on Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horcher was beat up for two years. No man can take the insults he took for 
two years without retribution," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, who left the Assembly to seek the state Senate seat being vacated by 
County Supervisor-elect Marian Bergeson, now offers some more advice on how to 
break the stalemate over the speakership: Brulte should step aside for the good 
of the party and allow another Republican to run, someone Horcher would 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could settle this whole thing tomorrow morning," Ferguson said. "The 
people's business is a hell of a lot more important than who should be Speaker. 
. . . But step aside? Politicians don't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting trim: With a run for the state Senate looming, Assemblyman Ross 
Johnson (R-Placentia) has done what all good candidates do -- he's lost weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol denizens were surprised to see Johnson return from vacation in early 
December looking far sleeker than when he left. Most assumed Johnson had 
slimmed down in anticipation of his duel with Ferguson and Assemblywoman Doris 
Allen (R-Cypress) for Bergeson's Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't bother asking Johnson what's up with it. An aide said Johnson won't 
comment on the weight loss, or the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Passings: Cecil Green, the state lawmaker from Norwalk who represented a piece 
of Orange County during the late 1980s, died this month at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, a Democrat, was elected to the state Senate in a special election in 
1987 that helped keep the Democrats in command of the upper chamber during a 
nip-and-tuck struggle with Republicans. The two parties poured $2.6 million 
into the contest, making it the most costly Legislative race in the history of 
the state up to that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Green was reelected in 1988, but his district was carved up in the 1990 
reapportionment, and he left the Legislature in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Green was elected to the Norwalk council in 1974 and served as councilman 
until he left for the state house. Before that, he worked in a variety of 
capacities -- as a carpenter, a construction contractor, a licensed commercial 
pilot and flight instructor. Green also worked with Fotomat Corp. on planning 
and zoning problems during the 1970s and early '80s. He is survived by his 
wife, Mary, and a daughter.

VOTE FLARES UP JUANENO DISPUTE OVER TRIBAL LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Juaneno Band of Mission Indians elected a tribal leader and council 
Saturday, while an opposing faction called the results meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonia Johnston was named tribal leader, but declined to discuss her new 
position Saturday night. Johnston said she and other new members of the Juaneno 
council would be talking about their roles at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 But David Belardes, the leader of a rival faction, was quick to dismiss 
Saturday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's meaningless," said Belardes, who met with 95 other tribal members in a 
separate meeting Saturday. "(Johnston) thinks she is recognized by the main 
body of the tribe, but she's not. She's trying to make this election legal, but 
it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The escalating feud over leadership may jeopardize the Juaneno's bid to become 
the first tribe of Native Americans in Orange County to receive federal 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Such federal acknowledgment, which the tribe has sought for a century, would 
mean schools, housing and health care supplied by taxpayers. Also, the new 
federal status for one of the Southland's oldest tribes would open the door for 
it to operate potentially lucrative casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes, a 47-year-old groundskeeper for the Capistrano Unified School 
District, refused to participate in the elections, even though he was nominated 
to the tribal council. Belardes, a longtime tribal spokesman, has refused to 
yield his leadership post since being ousted in a recent controversial vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes said he believes he was elected as tribal chairman in 1993, an 
election Johnston's group contends was void because it was a voice vote, rather 
than formal balloting.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Belardes says that a majority of the 2,000 members will remain 
loyal to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's vote follows a November ruling by an Orange County Superior Court 
judge that denied an injunction sought by Belardes to halt the election. 
Earlier this year, Belardes also failed in an attempt to stop Johnston from 
using the Juaneno name. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitterness between the groups prompted Belardes to post security guards at 
a September meeting to prevent Johnston and her group from participating. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court trial is set in April to resolve the leadership dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The infighting comes at a time when Juanenos are preparing for a visit early 
next year by representatives of the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, one of the 
steps toward tribal recognition. In recent months, they have emerged from among 
hundreds of groups, rising to the top of a long list trying to gain active 
consideration by the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal authorities can only grant the coveted status to one Juaneno 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to hurt us to have her out there as a faction," said Belardes, who 
met with 95 tribe members Saturday. "When the federal government gets here they 
will be able to tell who the real Indians are. We know who we are."

1-YEAR-OLD HIT IN DRIVEWAY DIES 
</P>

<P>
 A 1-year-old girl was fatally struck by a car backing out of a driveway early 
Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor said Miriam Juarez apparently walked out of her house unnoticed by 
her mother and was standing in the driveway at 8:45 a.m. when a 1994 Chevrolet 
Blazer backed from a house behind the Juarez family's out the shared driveway 
toward the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Lopez, who lives two doors away, said the girl's father, Jesus Juarez, 
was working on his car in the driveway, but did not notice she was nearby until 
after the car had hit her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was coming out when I saw him with the little baby in the hands," Lopez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics took the girl to Holy Cross Hospital in 
Mission Hills, where she was pronounced dead of massive head injuries, Fire 
Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Officer Bill Rice of the Valley Traffic Division said that after a 
preliminary investigation, police had no immediate plans to seek charges 
against either the parents or the driver of the vehicle, Jose Melendez Jr., 34, 
of Lancaster.

1 KILLED, 8 WOUNDED IN RASH OF VALLEY VIOLENCE; CRIME: BOY, 16, IS FATALLY SHOT

 Seven people were shot, one fatally, and two others stabbed in a rash of 
violence that kept police and paramedics busy across the Valley this weekend. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 In Northridge, a 52-year-old man was shot by robbers at 11 p.m. Friday when he 
returned to his home in the 17100 block of Prairie Street, said Police Lt. 
Steve Zipperman of the Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives who handled the case were unavailable Saturday, and officers on

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; BIRD-WATCHERS TAKE CENSUS OF LOCAL SPECIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High-powered binoculars at the ready, 80 members of the Ventura Audubon 
Society fanned out over a 177-square-mile territory Saturday to count as many 
birds as they could find. 
</P>
<P>
 The local bird-watchers were taking part in the National Audubon Society's 
annual Christmas Bird Count, a scientific census of bird populations across the 
Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking along Canada Larga Road in the hills north of Ventura, four of the 
birders spotted examples of 27 species, including a loggerhead shrike, a 
red-breasted sapsucker, a phainopepla, three red-tailed hawks, a golden eagle 
and five black phoebes. 
</P>
<P>
 While they might sound impressive, the sightings were nothing extraordinary, 
experienced bird-watchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's slow today, there's no doubt about it," said Jan Lewison, a retired 
administrator for the U. S. State Department who has belonged to the Ventura 
Audubon chapter since it began in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura club usually records between 175 and 185 types of birds in the 
Christmas count, often placing it among the top 10 clubs nationally, event 
coordinator Virgil Ketner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bird-watchers divide into small groups to cover as many different habitats 
as possible, Ketner said, with some going out on a boat in the ocean, some 
heading for the Santa Clara River, and others heading further inland. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts on Canada Larga Road made finding and identifying birds look easy. 
John Borneman, who recently retired as a professional Audubon Society staff 
member, called out the names of birds based only on their sounds, and Lewison 
was so confident she left her field guide in her car. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Lewison acknowledged that finding birds can be a challenge, as she 
peered in vain at the tree branches above her head. 
</P>
<P>
 She knew there ought to be one up there because of the fresh "whitewash" on 
the road, but she could not spot the bird. "It's so hard to see them," Lewison 
said. "They can be sitting there looking right at you going by." 
</P>
<P>
 After spotting a bird, watchers identified the species based on size, shape, 
color, call or a combination method that Borneman called "the gestalt of the 
bird -- there's no other bird that does all those things at one time." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Christmas Bird Count will take place today, as the Conejo Valley 
Audubon Society scours a circular, 15-mile-diameter area centered in Newbury 
Park. IRA E. STOLL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR REPAIR LOANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Small-business owners in Simi Valley whose property was damaged in the Jan. 17 
earthquake have three extra months to seek city loans for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has extended the deadline from the end of the year to March 31 to 
allow businesses extra time to apply for as much as $2,500 in interest-free 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan program was approved by the City Council to help businesses with 
fewer than 20 employees whose quake damages are not covered by the Small 
Business Administration or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the city has received 14 applications and awarded $15,000 in loans, 
said Mark Oyler, Simi Valley's earthquake recovery rehabilitation coordinator. 
About $60,000 in loan money is still available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many businesses in town are just now getting their determination from FEMA or 
SBA on whether they will get loans," Oyler said. "If all the repairs are not 
covered, that doesn't leave much time to apply to the city to make up the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners do not need to wait for a decision from FEMA and the SBA in 
order to apply for a city loan, Oyler said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 In tribute to an employee killed in last year's shooting at an Oxnard 
unemployment office, the Assn. for Retarded Citizens-Ventura County has 
established a memorial award in his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard M. Bateman worked for the association helping people with disabilities 
adjust to new jobs.Bateman, 65, was one of three people shot to death last 
December when a gunman opened fire at the state Employment Development 
Department office in Oxnard. A police officer was later slain in the rampage 
before the gunman was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Bateman) was an inspirational person for all of us," said Kimberly Little, a 
spokeswoman for the association. "He had a desire to help people in need, and 
he did help a lot of us." 
</P>
<P>
 During its annual awards ceremony Saturday at the Naval Construction Battalion 
Center in Port Hueneme, the association gave the Bateman Award to employees 
Clarice Lane and Karen Smith, who have "demonstrated extraordinary commitment 
to people with disabilities," Little said.  
</P>
<P>
 The association plans to present the award annually and display a plaque with 
the names of recipients at its headquarters on Lewis Road in Camarillo.

CHINESE CRABS FOUND IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Chinese crab regarded as a delicacy in its native land has spread to 
California where scientists fear it could harm crops, levees and possibly the 
health of people who eat them. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at the Marine Science Institute netted five Chinese mitten crabs 
in south San Francisco Bay -- enough to conclude the crabs are living and 
breeding and won't disappear, biologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be bad news for the ecology, for farming, and the security of the 
levees" in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, University of California marine 
biologist Andrew Cohen said last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Institute director Karen Grimmer said the crabs live in rivers and descend to 
the ocean to spawn. The only other organism in North America with such habits 
is the Atlantic river eel. 
</P>
<P>
 California banned the import of the crab in 1986. Scientists suspect someone 
intentionally released the crabs into the bay. The 6-inch-wide crab with hairy 
claws resembling mittens is the latest of about 200 imported species to 
establish a population in the bay-delta estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 The crabs spend most of their lives either in rivers or in the brackish water 
of upper estuaries, living in burrows dug in mud banks and feeding on a variety 
of plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The mitten crab also carries Oriental lung fluke, a parasite that can be 
transmitted to people who eat inadequately cooked or pickled crab. The parasite 
causes lung problems similar to tuberculosis.

SUSPECT IN LONG BEACH ABDUCTION IS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A drifter who allegedly abducted and molested an 8-year-old Long Beach girl 
before abandoning her in the desert was behind bars Saturday after a three-week 
search led investigators to the suspect in a Palm Springs bar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaine Kelley Beckham, who calls himself "Cowboy Kelley," was being held in 
Long Beach Jail in lieu of $500,000 bail and was expected to be arraigned by 
Tuesday on charges of molestation and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckham, 34, befriended the girl's family about six months ago after they were 
introduced by mutual friends, said Long Beach Police spokeswoman Karen Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 29, the parents allowed Beckham to take the girl to a grocery store. 
Instead of going to the store, Beckham drove the girl to a remote desert area 
in Riverside County and, after binding her hands with her shoelaces, allegedly 
sexually assaulted her, Kerr said. He left the girl in the desert and drove 
away, Kerr said. The girl managed to flag down a passing car and summon help. 
</P>
<P>
 Police launched a massive media blitz in the weeks following the incident, 
distributing drawings of Beckham that led to numerous tips. A photograph 
obtained from one of Beckham's acquaintances was distributed widely across 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckham was arrested Friday by Palm Springs police after bar patrons 
recognized him and detained him.

VISUAL ARTS PANEL HAS DESIGNS ON CIVIC PLAZA; THOUSAND OAKS: GROUP WANTS 
PAINTINGS, SCULPTURE AND OTHER WORKS FILLING COMPLEX'S HALLWAYS AND TERRACES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to attract major traveling museum shows from around the country to 
Thousand Oaks, a new group has plans to turn some of the vast hallways and 
terraces in the Civic Arts Plaza into public exhibit space for the visual arts. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Civic Arts Plaza Visual Arts Committee wants is for people to come 
from around the region not just to see comedians such as Bill Cosby and 
crooners such as Tony Bennett, but to enjoy paintings, sculpture and other 
artworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Members want to dispel the idea that the vast structure next to the Ventura 
Freeway is an unwelcoming monolith by humanizing its bare walls and long, empty 
corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to start thinking of this building as theirs," committee 
Chairwoman Marta Timm said. "When they refer to it as 'yours' to me, I always 
correct them and say, 'No, it's ours.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A welcome side effect of the committee's work may be to lay to rest charges 
that the visual arts are too often neglected in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people in the visual arts feel like they are playing second 
fiddle to the performing arts now," said Rudyard Beldner, president of the Arts 
Council of the Conejo Valley, which operates a city-owned art gallery for local 
artists in Newbury Park, next to the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the idea of a rotating exhibit space at the Civic Arts Plaza is 
welcomed, many argue that museum space should have been set aside in the 
original plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great idea," Arts Council member Nancy Peloso said. "But it would 
have been great if we had had an art museum attached to the plaza, a place that 
people could have viewed during intermissions. It'll never give us what a room 
of our own would have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a core gallery space to work with, Timm sees a wealth of 
potential when she looks around the Civic Arts Plaza. Peeking down into the 
outdoor garden area next to City Hall offices -- now the home of two small 
ficus trees and a few pieces of black patio furniture -- she pictures a 
sculpture garden inside the pale walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Her vision is for something grand, for the Civic Arts Plaza to draw traveling 
exhibits of high enough caliber to match the scale of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Georgia O'Keeffe, now she would look smashing in here," Timm said, measuring 
the pale purple walls in the Performing Arts Center with her eyes. "But who is 
going to fund that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Who indeed? Since the city has already invested $64 million into the 
building's construction and $22 million into acquiring the land, it is unlikely 
it would provide any funding to the fledging group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should plan on private funding," Mayor Jaime Zukowski said 
ruefully. "The '80s are over." 
</P>
<P>
 Timm hopes to build an endowment through grants and art sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically have been given no funds to work with," she said. "Which means 
we have to start from scratch. People have really responded to the theater's 
fund raising, but I have no seats they could put their names on, or anything 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenges are many, security risks being the biggest. There is only one 
area -- the Founders Lounge -- inside the performing arts center that is now 
secure. With any major exhibit, the committee would have to hire a security 
firm to protect the art. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging the art is also a problem. Drilling holes in the pristine lilac walls 
of the center is not allowed, so Timm has to work around that. 
</P>
<P>
 Logically, to Timm and others, the Conejo Valley seems like an ideal site for 
a thriving arts community. There are plenty of wealthy people in the area, 
private collectors who live nearby and many artists working from home studios. 
But these elements have never quite coalesced. That is a shame, city Arts 
Commissioner Patricia Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real need for a permanent museum in Thousand Oaks," Grant said. 
"There is no doubt about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Thousand Oaks does have one art museum. The Conejo Valley Art 
Museum was founded in 1978 as a nonprofit private corporation. It has never 
been able to find a permanent home, however, despite the promise by a Santa 
Barbara man that as soon as they do he will give them $5 million in art from 
his private collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Without an endowment and beset with funding problems, the museum has wandered 
nomad-like around the city, ending up in February, 1991, in an incongruous 
setting between Sears and Toys R Us in the Janss Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The small storefront there has been given to the museum by mall developer Bill 
Janss rent free since then, but major mall renovations will force the museum to 
shut down Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In its storefront setting, it looks more like a gallery than a true museum, 
and director Maria Dessornes said she is anxious to eventually find a more 
stately, permanent home for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she asked the city to reserve space in the Civic Arts Plaza for the 
museum. But with no permanent collection or endowment, she said the city did 
not believe the museum had any financial assets to offer the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's cultural liaison, Carol Williams, said city officials do have 
serious questions on the museum's financial stability, largely because of an 
agreement between the two that went sour several years ago. At one time, the 
museum was given rent-free space in a city-owned building on Wilbur Road. The 
museum, however, was to be responsible for its own utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the museum left Wilbur Road, it had accumulated a utility bill of 
about $14,000. After wrangling over the debt for a while, Dessornes said the 
museum agreed to pay it off a little at a time. But the museum's only sources 
of income are from private donations and revenue from the annual Artwalk, which 
usually raises about $15,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has not charged interest on the amount, the museum still 
owes $10,016, according to Williams. The last payment made was $25 in 
September. As a result, relations between the two parties have been distinctly 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult when they owe us money and then they come and ask us for 
more," Williams said. "It amazes me that they do that. They should pay off 
their debt to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dessornes has not given up on the museum. She hopes to operate from a small 
office -- it may end up being in her home -- until a suitable space can be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 But meanwhile, other members of the arts community have clearly moved on, some 
focusing their attentions on the new project. Some say they felt Dessornes did 
not welcome help, instead taking on more and more responsibility at the museum 
as the years went on. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that the museum would do better if it took to the pattern of 
other local arts groups and operated on a democratic basis," said one arts 
representative who declined to be identified. "Maria runs it as a one-man 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 Dessornes said dwindling numbers of volunteers have forced her to wear many 
hats at the museum, which may lend to the impression that she is unwilling to 
delegate responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that I probably have done too much of is the fact that some of 
them have resigned and I have taken on those responsibilities," she said. "But 
the show must go on, you can't wait until you find somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Dessornes does not get a salary, despite the fact that running the museum has 
become a full-time job. That is typical of working in the arts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people that would not take my job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timm has a similar philosophical attitude on the lack of monetary compensation 
for her work at the Civic Arts Plaza. Williams met Timm while she was 
volunteering on this year's Artwalk and asked her to head up the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 At 29, Timm is just finishing up a degree in art history at Cal State 
Northridge's Ventura campus. Taking on a challenge of these proportions is a 
little daunting, but will be worth it if she can pull it off, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too good to pass up," she said. "If I had said no, maybe it wouldn't 
have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza Visual Arts Committee is looking for new volunteers.

WOMAN WALKS OUT OF COSTA MESA JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 53-year-old woman escaped from the city jail early Saturday, about two hours 
after she was arrested on a traffic violation and subsequently was found to 
have outstanding burglary and drug warrants, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Jane Willis of Santa Ana slipped out a door in the back of the jail, 
said Costa Mesa Police Lt. Alan Kent. 
</P>
<P>
 "She walked through a door that was left ajar," Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis was arrested shortly after midnight at Bay Street and Newport Boulevard 
for driving with a suspended license and providing false information, Kent 
said. Police then discovered the woman had three outstanding warrants -- two 
for burglary and one for possession of narcotics paraphernalia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are seeking help in capturing Willis and asked that anyone with 
information call Costa Mesa police at (714) 754-5280.

SIMI VALLEY PLANNING PANEL SAYS LLAMAS CAN STAY; ZONING: THE PACK ANIMALS, SAID 
TO BE SMELLY AND A DANGER TO HORSES WHO ARE NERVOUS AROUND THEM, ARE ALLOWED TO 
STAY IN PRESTIGIOUS EQUESTRIAN COMMUNITIES.

<P>
 Somehow, despite an organized effort to run them out of Simi Valley, and the 
blistering remarks about how they smell and their bad teeth, and the jeers 
about their funny looks, Greg Dames' lowly llamas appear wholly unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Dames' neighbors asked the city to classify the beasts far 
below the lofty horse, down somewhere with barnyard and circus animals.  
</P>
<P>
 Forget the storm whipped up in two of Simi Valley's prestigious equestrian 
communities this week over the presence of the sturdy South American pack 
animals -- with their camel-like heads and long necks -- in territory zoned for 
horses and ponies. 
</P>
<P>
 The llamas mean no harm to anyone, owner Greg Dames said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, residents of the Bridle Path Homeowners Assn. asked the Simi Valley 
Planning Commission on Wednesday night to exclude llamas from their 
neighborhood, an area crisscrossed by horse paths and peppered with stables. 
</P>
<P>
 After pleas from the Dames and another llama owner, Maxwell Pelter, to spare 
their back-yard pets, three commissioners voted unanimously to include the 
beasts among the animals allowed in Simi Valley's horse country. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour meeting pitted Dames and Pelter against their neighbors, who 
contended that the presence of llamas in a horse-only zone would diminish 
property values and pose a threat to children riding on skittish horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners listened intently as the arguments unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Wilson, secretary of the Bridle Path Homeowners Assn., said it was not a 
question of the animal's curious looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue has nothing to do with how cute or sweet or wonderful the llamas 
are," Wilson said. "Our community was created to be exclusively equine. No 
matter what anyone says, the llama is still a member of the camel family." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and neighbor Marlane Gregoire argued that a horse plodding down one of 
the area's dirt riding paths would be spooked if it came across a llama. 
</P>
<P>
 "My horses are terrified of the llamas," Gregoire said. "If someone less 
experienced were to come across a llama on the bridle path, they could get 
thrown." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood fought for the horse zone expressly to avoid run-ins with 
farm animals, she said. Simi Valley has another zoning classification where 
people can keep any kind of animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it makes us sound like snobs, but the horse zone is an elite area," 
Gregoire said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gregoire spoke, Janet McKinney rose to tell the commissioners about her 
experience with the llamas. "I am the only person who has to work right next to 
the llamas," said McKinney, whose complaints seven months ago sparked the 
neighborhood feud. "I can tell you they have a very distinct odor and the wind 
pushes it right into my yard." 
</P>
<P>
 In letters to the commission, McKinney and her husband complained that the 
llamas spit, and argued that in buying the strange animal, the Pelters were 
creating an "Old McDonald's Farm" in their own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks left Pelter and Dames cringing in their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 If llamas had been in the chamber to hear these attacks, Dames said the docile 
animals' feelings would have been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, as he shoveled straw into feeding bins for his 11 llamas, 
Dames explained how he came to purchase this animal that looks less like a 
horse than it does a creation of Dr. Seuss. 
</P>
<P>
 On a packing trip some friends offered Dames the chance to visit a llama 
ranch. Despite only having seen mention of the beasts in a Doctor Doolittle 
book, Dames dropped more than $1,000 on the table and bought one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw one being born and I became really enthused. I had just turned 40 and 
the llamas just seemed to fill a gap in my life," Dames said. "Let's face it, I 
fell in love." 
</P>
<P>
 The herd in Dames' yard grew quickly. Two weeks ago, the birth of a 
black-haired llama named Whitney brought the number to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the one-acre corral where the llamas wander, occasionally tugging at 
hay or peering out at passing horses, remains clean and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 The only noise the llamas make is a soft humming noise, and their padded feet 
allow them to prance across the yard quietly, as if they were wearing slippers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an impassioned plea for the creatures, Pres Lovato described his experience 
as a llama's next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The llamas do not bark, like my neighbor's dog. They do not smell bad, like 
the horses. They won't kick you or bite you," Lovato said. "To know these 
simple creatures is to love them." 
</P>
<P>
 Only when Dames sold one of his llamas to Pelter did the anti-llama fever 
begin to spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Dames, Pelter took his llama out on the bridle path for a walk. 
Homeowner association secretary Wilson said she began receiving complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier this year, she consulted city officials, who told her that they 
had agreed in 1987 to permit llamas in the equestrian community. The city 
argued that a llama could be allowed because it was close in size and 
temperament to a pony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had any concerns about this for nearly eight years," Planning 
Commissioner Michael Piper said. "So the question that is before us now is 
essentially, did the city make the right call in 1987? I think they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Sherida Simmons said it was clear that horses were easily 
frightened by many things, not just llamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard from someone tonight that her horse was afraid of a head of 
lettuce," Simmons said. "I just don't believe this is a safety issue." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dames and Pelter, the 3-0 verdict was, in a way, confirmation that it was 
OK to love a llama. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if they'd have an opinion on all this," Dames said outside the 
hearing. "But I'm going to give them an extra ration of hay tomorrow to let 
them celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Pelter, he plans to take his llama out onto the bridle path for a 
victory lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to walk her right over to the Dames' for a breeding," Pelter said 
with a smile. "The more llamas we have in this community the merrier."

LANCASTER MAN FINDS OLD SMOKE GRENADES BURIED IN HIS YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man called the Antelope Valley sheriff's station Saturday saying he had 
found what looked like four hand grenades while digging in his yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Explosives experts later determined that the devices, found at 120th Street 
East about 3:15 p.m., were actually smoke grenades used to mark military 
aircraft landings, said Deputy David Reddish. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies have not determined how old the grenades were or how they got to 
Merril McLernon's yard, Reddish said.

MIKE DOWNEY: BOYS' NIGHT OUT BECAME A NIGHTMARE; THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS 
ABOUT CRASH THAT LEFT SEAHAWKS' FRIER PARALYZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first night of December, around 7:30, Kelly Butler drove through a 
corridor of twinkling Christmas lights in this lakeside village to a 
combination billiards parlor and pub called The Shark to pick up her boyfriend, 
Mike Frier, 25, a 6-foot-5, 299-pound defensive tackle for the Seattle Seahawks 
with whom she has a baby daughter. He wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the football team's players had been inside The Shark, playing pool on 
what Butler called "a boys' night out." She had dropped off Frier at 4:30 and 
promised to pick him up. A bartender told police that the five men had consumed 
approximately 10 beers and did not seem to be, in his professional opinion, 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 From a pay phone inside the pool hall, Butler had her boyfriend paged. Frier's 
beeper went off in the back seat of a 1992 Oldsmobile Bravada with Indiana 
license plates belonging to teammate Wilbur Lamar Smith, 24, a Seahawk running 
back. Up front with Smith sat the team's superstar, Chris Warren, also a 
running back, in fact the American Football Conference's leading rusher. 
Question is, which man sat behind the wheel? 
</P>
<P>
 Police presumed it was Warren. They slapped handcuffs on him and charged him 
with vehicular assault. Warren's attorney, however, says Smith was the driver. 
So does Smith's attorney. And so does Butler, who heard this directly from her 
boyfriend, just after doctors fused the broken vertebrae in his neck, placed 
him in cervical traction and prepared him for a lifetime of paralysis from the 
neck down. 
</P>
<P>
 The music inside the Olds was evidently quite loud. Frier had neglected to 
tell his girlfriend that he had a ride. Upon receiving her page, he leaned 
forward to let Warren and Smith know that he needed to find a phone. Warren 
suggested that they drive to his place in Redmond, no more than six miles away. 
But then, patting his pockets, Warren suddenly realized that he had forgotten 
his house keys in Kirkland, at the football team's training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 At a reported 8:40 p.m. on the rainy night in question, the utility vehicle 
registered to Smith traveled northbound down 108th Avenue Northeast, running 
parallel to the banks of Lake Washington off to the passengers' side. They 
passed an espresso and pastry shop called the Muffin Break and then a Kirkland 
fire station, approaching the little gray schoolhouse, gaily decorated for the 
holidays, that marks the turnoff to the Seahawks' camp. 
</P>
<P>
 A police sergeant said the initial indication was that the vehicle carrying 
the players pulled into a left-turn lane to pass another car. An eyewitness, 
Dave Needham, 19, of Kirkland, reported that he and his friends heard the very 
loud music, "a big, booming bass," turned to look and to their amazement saw 
the Olds swerve off the road and into a roadside electrical-power pole with a 
noisy crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers ran to a nearby house, one of them screaming, "Call 911!" 
</P>
<P>
 All electricity went out in about 4,500 homes in Kirkland and nearby Bellevue, 
including the residence of Tom Flores, the Seahawks' general manager and coach. 
He had just gotten home from practice and had no idea that three of his players 
were responsible for the blackout, that they were, at that moment, pinned 
inside the wreckage of a small truck, its front end so smashed that the 
steering wheel was practically pressed against the utility pole. 
</P>
<P>
 The wait was terrible. Most of the windows were broken. Needham stood nearby, 
virtually helpless until authorities came. He said, "The guy in back (Frier) 
was doubled over, yelling. The man was in incredible pain." 
</P>
<P>
 When fire fighters finally began working to free the men from the debris, 
crackling showers of electrical sparks descended on them from atop the power 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 A second witness said he looked into the truck and saw a case of beer, Bud 
Ice, partly crumpled. A detective from the Kirkland police, Jim O'Toole, 
confirmed that empty beer cans had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 No skid marks were visible on the damp pavement. "We're not talking drag 
racing," Kirkland Police Sgt. Mark Smith said. "We're talking people driving 
too fast for conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, the news of the accident hit the people of Seattle with 
considerable impact. Details were sketchy, some incorrect. "Chris Warren 
Arrested," a headline read, and this much was true. The identity of his 
paralyzed teammate was withheld in many accounts, pending notification of the 
family. At least two newspapers misidentified the make of the vehicle and one 
of them, the Journal-American of Bellevue, described it as a "Chevy Blazer 
driven by Warren," possibly erring twice in five words. 
</P>
<P>
 What followed in days to come was a veritable Warren Report of fact-finding 
investigation. To this day, police have yet to formally exclude Warren as the 
driver of the vehicle, despite denials all around. They have dusted the 
steering wheel for fingerprints but not yet revealed their findings. Warren 
also agreed to a lie-detector test, administered by a University of Utah 
professor who also tested serial killer Ted Bundy and kidnap victim Patty 
Hearst. The professor, David Raskin, announced that Warren had passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this does, it lends substantial credence to Lamar Smith's admission that 
he was the driver and Warren's denial," said Warren's attorney, John Wolfe. 
Warren's agent, Richard Schaeffer of Baltimore, issued a statement that he was 
confident that Warren was not the driver and that "there was a misunderstanding 
at the accident scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Warren was the driver. Police obtained a warrant to 
search the vehicle and dusted the steering wheel for prints. King County 
Prosecutor spokesman Dan Donohue said, "We are moving very slowly, very 
deliberately. We are not going to jump into this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Police reportedly are re-contacting witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren has clammed up, at his attorney's behest. He has two cracked ribs. 
Smith has foot and neck injuries and cannot play football. Frier remains in 
intensive care, where teammates have not been permitted to visit. He recently 
developed post-operative pneumonia, a common complication of quadriplegia, and 
fluid is being sucked from his lungs. Frier is now breathing with the aid of a 
tube. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likelihood of his walking again is very poor," said the neurological 
surgeon, Michael Schlitt, who performed the spinal fusion on Frier. "He will 
almost certainly be wheelchair-dependent." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, meantime, has not missed a minute of football. He has rarely played 
better. He rushed last week at Houston for a career-high 185 yards. Beforehand, 
he kiddingly kicked at a ground-level TV camera as the Seahawks ran onto the 
field -- not menacingly, but playfully. Maybe he is making an effort to lighten 
the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 After his first game after the accident, Warren said, "I am not answering 
those questions about Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 In the opinion of columnist Steve Kelley of the Seattle Times, he was "as 
matter-of-fact as a ticket-taker, as cold as an Arctic wind." 
</P>
<P>
 This has been said of him before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every so often, Warren wonders why he is not a brighter star, why he is not a 
more popular player among fans. People tell him it's Seattle. That the team is 
weak and the exposure is poor. Somewhere else, had someone rushed for 1,000 
yards three consecutive seasons the way Warren has, that player might be as 
marketable as Emmitt Smith. Then again, Thurman Thomas played in several Super 
Bowls, and how popular is he? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a favorite story of linebacker Rod Stephens that in public places in 
Seattle, their bodies being large and their faces looking vaguely familiar, 
athletes are approached by people who ask, " 'Y'all play for the Seahawks?' So 
we say yes. So they ask for an autograph and Warren signs and they say, 'Oh, 
yeah! Now we know who you are!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he was finally invited to join other NFL notables for something 
called "NFL Kickoff '94: Run to Daylight" before this season, Warren was 
reminded of his lack of stature. A box of custom-made jerseys for Jerome 
Bettis, Ricky Watters, Eric Metcalf and other top running backs was opened and 
the shirts were dispersed. Warren's had the wrong number, 32 instead of 42. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me (former Seahawk) John L. Williams' number," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, Warren insists, Howie Long of the Raiders was speaking to him 
about being a running back for Seattle and how it must be difficult to get 
playing time because of this guy Chris Warren who plays up there. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren said, "He was talking to me the whole time about me and he didn't know 
it was me." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps were Warren to show the warmth to outsiders that he does to teammates, 
he might be suitably famous. He has been known to treat blockers to $1,000 
dinners. He bought each of them Rolex wristwatches as gifts last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 After Warren was named to the Pro Bowl last week, he announced that he was 
buying first-class airplane tickets to Hawaii for the offensive linemen for the 
Feb. 5 game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe them at least that much," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was Warren, with no small measure of irony, who one month ago, as he 
again neared the 1,000-yard mark, tried but failed to take teammates on the 
town after practice. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time he said, "Almost all of them had other commitments. I can never 
get all the guys together. Everyone has their own lives. They have girlfriends 
or wives wanting them to do things in their off-time. I understand that. It's 
no big deal. I don't want them to get in trouble, saying that they had to do 
something with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing about that. Ever since childhood, Warren has been seen, more or 
less, as standoffish. His mother said that in Little League baseball, Chris 
would hit a home run, round the bases, return to the dugout and sit without a 
word or a smile. Regina Eagle said of her son, "He'd just be sitting there 
like, 'Go away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Similar sentiments came from his high school football coach in Fairfax, Va., 
where ability was more Warren's thing than sociability. Nick Hilgert said he 
would need Warren for only three quarters because by then the team would be 
leading by several touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't someone who jumped up and down and put his hands on his hips and 
said, 'Well, look at me!' " Hilgert recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But oh, could he look good. Warren's mother said Chris was so conscious of his 
appearance, she had to buy a washboard and special soap to scrub the grass 
stains from his uniform, because mere laundering wasn't enough. Chris even 
cleaned his shoes in the sink with a toothbrush. "He wanted to be immaculate," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 What he forgot to be was academic. All the major colleges came calling and 
Warren picked nearby Virginia. Offensive tackle Ray Roberts of the Seahawks was 
there at the time and couldn't wait to see this kid who people said could catch 
punts behind his back. Seahawk linebacker Andy Heck played in high school 
against Warren and remembered being dragged for 15 yards into the end zone, 
trying to tackle him. Heck said, "He even beat us at the buzzer in the 
basketball playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 But the D he got in Greek mythology and the same grade he got in biology cost 
Warren his eligibility, not with the NCAA but with the more demanding 
university. Warren enrolled at an academy called Ferrum, so intimate that 
teachers dined with students. It was so anonymous to people from the sports 
world, though, Warren later joked, "They must wonder if it's a black college." 
</P>
<P>
 Scouts from the Seahawks made an appointment to see Warren. Where they ended 
up seeing him was at a rest stop along Interstate 81, somewhere between 
Roanoke, Va., and the North Carolina border. Warren's car had broken down on 
his way to see the Seahawks. Player personnel director Mike Allman told him to 
stay put. He and his associates cleared out parking spaces at the rest area, 
threw Warren a few passes and picked him in the fourth round on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
 He waited two years for someone to hand him the football or for Coach Chuck 
Knox to leave. After carrying 17 times from scrimmage over two seasons, Warren 
was given his chance by Flores. Only five NFL backs topped 1,000 yards in both 
1992 and 1993, among them Warren. This season he leads the AFC in rushing and 
total yards. With 120 yards rushing today against the Raiders, he will break 
Curt Warner's single-season club record. 
</P>
<P>
 And no busted ribs can stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Saturday night after the accident, Warren slept in his own bed, rather 
than at the team's hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to think about it before I made a decision," he told John Clayton of 
the Tacoma News-Tribune. "It's not like I made the decision (to play) right 
away when I woke up. I had a few days to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren showered, shaved, then phoned Clarence Shelmon, who coaches the running 
backs, to say he would play against Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the locker room, Warren encountered his teammates for the first time. 
He couldn't slip in unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to go into a locker room and not be noticed," Warren said. "There 
were a number of players who greeted me and just said they were praying for me. 
It was like a comfort zone for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of this comfort came from teammate Eugene Robinson, who said, "I gave the 
brother a hug just to let him know that he's not out there by himself, and 
said, 'I'm praying for you and will continue to pray for you.' " Praying for 
Warren to do what, he didn't say. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack Strong began the game in his place, but fumbled a screen pass on 
Seattle's first possession. In came Warren, wearing a flak jacket over ribs too 
tender to bandage. 
</P>
<P>
 Seahawk tackle Roberts said, "Even if he had just dressed and come out, I 
think it would have helped him. For Chris, I think this was his way of being at 
peace with himself. The more he sits around and thinks, the worse it becomes." 
</P>
<P>
 What else he was thinking, Warren pretty much kept to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any soreness?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course there was soreness," Warren snapped. "I've been in a car wreck." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So had Mike Frier. In the intensive-care ward of Overlake Hospital medical 
center in Bellevue, the big tackle was having his feet massaged by his 
girlfriend. He whispered to her that he could feel it. He was even moving both 
arms, although he could move nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's unbelievable, though," Butler said. "Before the surgery, he was joking 
with the nurses, joking with me. They wheeled him into the operating room and 
he was still joking. He knows the situation himself, but you wouldn't have 
known something was wrong with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Frier appeared in 34 NFL games and will appear in no more. Like Warren, he 
came from a small-college background, at Appalachian State, and beat the odds. 
In 1992, the Seahawks tried to hide him on the practice squad in a roster move, 
but the Cincinnati Bengals got wise and claimed him on waivers. He didn't like 
it there and complained about his lack of playing time. The instant Cincinnati 
set him free, Seattle snapped him back up. 
</P>
<P>
 At the woodland training camp nestled amid the tall green firs, Seahawk 
defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy sits and does what Warren has been told not to 
do -- talk about Frier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to take him under my wing," Kennedy said. "I helped him rent a 
car when he got here. This isn't a new experience for me. I lost my friend 
Jerome Brown in a car crash like this. I just wish I'd gotten to know Mike 
better. About all I do know is how much he loved that baby girl of his." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said he had begun to use Frier more and that he had played particularly 
well against Kansas City. The accident saddened the coach, but he decided 
against lecturing the team about being careful because "emotions were pretty 
sensitive at that point" and because he thought the danger was self-evident. 
Twelve days later, cornerback Orlando Watters was arrested for drunken driving 
and five other violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores this time told all the players directly through Watters, "You screwed 
up. Every player is an adult and has to be held accountable for what he does in 
his personal life." 
</P>
<P>
 As for himself, Flores said, "I can't go home with each one of them. I can't 
lock them in a dorm." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach wasn't sure how to handle the first incident. He instructed Warren 
to go home and think for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the confusion of who was driving, all the stories coming out, it became 
bigger than life," Flores said. "People kept reminding everybody, 'Wait a 
minute. We've got a man in the hospital who's paralyzed. Let's think about 
him.' Yet the games go on. I told Chris to make the decision and we'll go with 
it. He's still sore, but he had a career day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris is not a talkative guy, but you could see it in his eyes. He was 
feeling a lot of emotion. Perhaps this was good therapy for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Frier's therapy will continue for months. He has no feeling in his hands 
or legs. There is slight movement in his biceps. His temperature has returned 
to normal, now that he is breathing with the aid of a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamar Smith has a chip fracture in his neck and a foot injury worse than first 
believed. He is sidelined for the rest of the season and awaiting results of 
the police's continuing investigation into whether he was driving the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Warren was to be honored Saturday by the Rainier District Youth Athletic 
Assn. as its role model of the year. He did say of Mike Frier, "I wish I could 
say 'Hi' to him right now with a capital H." It is unknown whether he will 
again ask his teammates out after practice, or whether they will have previous 
commitments.

JIM MURRAY: IT'S LOVE, SWEET LOVE FOR HIS HORSE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Jim Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
 Men try to leave their mark on the world in a variety of ways. It used to be 
in this country that the amassing of money was achievement enough. But that got 
tiresome for some. 
</P>
<P>
 So, men bought Rembrandts, others one-of-a-kind gems, first editions, 
Shakespeare folios, rare coins, Lincoln's letters, Napoleon's hat, stamp 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Henry Huntington used to say the ownership of a fine library was the 
best and surest way to immortality, but other men later found another more 
immediate path -- the ownership of a fine sports organization. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to say when sports ownership came into the culture. Jacob Ruppert 
bought a baseball team, the Yankees, to promote his beer. So did Gussie Busch. 
Then men started to buy teams to promote their egos, not their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich men tried to manage fighters. Some were content to supply their alma 
maters with football players but that was a somewhat anonymous role. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the original sport owners were those who raced horses and they did it 
largely for the sporting aspects, not the publicity. It wasn't called "the 
sport of kings" for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 In this country, we didn't have kings. But we had the next-best thing. Pierre 
Lorillard made his money out of cigarette smokers, the Whitneys out of subways 
and New York transits. The Wideners were so rich one of them went down with the 
Titanic. The Phippses owned land from New York to Florida and west to Colorado 
and played sandlot polo as children. The Vanderbilts' seed money was made out 
of New York Harbor ferryboats and Hudson river steamers so that their 
progenitor was known derisively as "Commodore." They all raced horses and 
formed stables. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, when these money-swollen personalities formed into a body to 
regulate horse racing, they called themselves the "Jockey Club." 
</P>
<P>
 This fascination with the sport spilled over into show business about the time 
racetracks began opening near the sound stages of Hollywood. Louis B. Mayer and 
the Warner Bros. were the first studio heads to buy and race horses, but it 
wasn't long before the talent bought into the deal, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Bing Crosby not only bought horses, he bought a track. Pretty soon you had a 
parade of entertainment characters, disc jockeys, agents, bandleaders and TV 
actors like Jack Klugman and Telly Savalas. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt Bacharach didn't need horse racing, either. Bert was one of those 
American bards who, as the song has it "writes the songs that make the whole 
world sing and the young girls cry." 
</P>
<P>
 If you've ever hummed, "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head," you know Burt 
Bacharach. "What the World Needs Now Is Love" is as big a standard as anything 
Irving Berlin ever wrote. "I'll Never Fall in Love Again" made the young girls 
cry. So did "Close to You," "Walk on By." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt won three Academy Awards. He accompanied and conducted for Marlene 
Dietrich, across the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to Russia, Israel, the Middle East," he remembers. "Going with 
Marlene was like going in with a conquering Army." 
</P>
<P>
 He's been married to some of the super beauties of the Hollywood scene, Angie 
Dickinson, Carole Bayer Sager. Dad was a nationally syndicated columnist for 
Hearst. Mother was an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt went to UCLA for a year. But he majored in Hollywood Park. And the beach. 
When he began his show biz career, playing piano for the Ames brothers and 
Dionne Warwick, he thought songwriting was "so startlingly simple, I thought I 
could write five or six a day." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later and "about a thousand" rejections down, he recalls thinking, 
"It's hard to be simple." 
</P>
<P>
 His first published song, "Warm and Tender," made the flip side of a Johnny 
Mathis record. But his absorption with racing began long before that. It began 
with childhood on Long Island when he made "mind bets" on the day's card. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hooked," he says, laughing. "But I was ignorant. When I saw 114 under 
the jockey's name, I thought that was the horse's weight." 
</P>
<P>
 He began buying horses and turning them over to Charlie Whittingham to train. 
He won almost immediately, but his first horse, a plater named Battle Royal, 
got claimed. Burt, crushed, recalls he "almost cried." He made Charlie buy him 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy Award for a horse owner is the Kentucky Derby. No show biz owner 
has ever won it, although plenty have tried. Bacharach came closer than most 
last year when his Soul Of The Matter finished fourth. Burt might have been the 
only owner in history who flew down to the race after a night of directing the 
Ft. Wayne Symphony and flying back directly after the race. 
</P>
<P>
 He may have to be on hand earlier next year. He has a 2-year-old running at 
Hollywood Park -- he runs in the Hollywood Futurity today -- who has been 
breaking clocks all over the homestretch and who won his last race so 
decisively that the jockey he went by in the stretch, Chris McCarron told the 
press, "They better check that horse's lip tattoo. He accelerated like a 
4-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon Deelites has the whole backstretch buzzing. Grooms, exercise boys, 
owners and trainers come to the rail in the morning when he works. For 
Bacharach, it's like going places with Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like when my songs hit the charts," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do I race?" he ponders. "I think it's because most of us are in a world 
we have control over. We control what's going on, whether it's a concert, a TV 
series, a movie to score or a tune to be written. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, we have something we love but can't control. You can't make a horse run 
faster than he wants to. That's the pain of it. But it's exhilarating for 
people who otherwise control their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, the race crowd is different. More understated, more calm, more 
comfortable to be with. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like the $2 bettor. We deal with the disappointments, shrug off the 
defeats, go back to the drawing board, the Form. You know how we are. There's 
always tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a song title to me.

LUCK OF IRISH COULD TURN IN BIG EAST; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: NOTRE DAME'S MOVE TO 
CONFERENCE NEXT FALL 'A COUP' THAT COULD MAKE TEAM POWERFUL AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Notre Dame continues to muddle through in its last basketball season as an 
independent, neither power nor patsy, capable of mind-boggling victories and 
head-scratching losses, sometimes in the same week. 
</P>
<P>
 An overtime victory over Indiana 2 1/2 weeks ago was followed by a loss to San 
Diego in which the Irish trailed by 31 points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been this way for more than four seasons now. The Irish, an 
almost-annual participant as recently as the late 1980s, made their last 
appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame was 12-17 last season, 9-18 two seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
 How to turn it around? 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, Irish officials believe they found the elixir to revive their 
moribund basketball program last summer when they agreed to join the Big East 
Conference next fall in all sports except football. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big East, of course, ranks among the nation's best in basketball, and the 
Notre Dame teams of the last few seasons probably would have struggled to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
 But by aligning themselves with the conference, the Irish believe they have 
put a new face on their program that will attract a higher caliber of recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in a conference identifies us," said Coach John MacLeod, who lobbied 
hard for the move. "Notre Dame itself doesn't need identification, but Notre 
Dame basketball needs identification. We are identified now not as an 
independent, but as a Big East member. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this process of identification allows us to be recognized in Boston, New 
York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, it gives Notre Dame higher visibility in areas that are major 
alumni bases and were once recruiting hot spots for the Irish. In the 1980s, 
the Big East and Atlantic Coast Conference took advantage of the emergence of 
ESPN to increase their television exposure, which helped them dominate the 
recruiting of top players. 
</P>
<P>
 By invitation, no less, the Irish believe they have been positioned to 
recapture their strongholds in the East. And as the only Big East member in the 
Midwest, they will be able to recruit more successfully against the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 "There might be a downside, but if there is, I don't know what it would be," 
said MacLeod, who is 42-52 in more than three seasons at Notre Dame, including 
3-2 this season. "The upside so far outweighs the downside and any negative 
that might be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many good things: We have a geographical turf from which to 
recruit, we have all kinds of great media exposure in the East. Now, we have to 
find out if we can handle it, and then grow into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, there are indications that things are looking up. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Notre Dame signed four highly regarded recruits, including point 
guard Doug Gottlieb of Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a major, major influence on my decision," Gottlieb said of the Irish's 
move to the Big East. "If they had remained independent . . . It wasn't just me 
-- probably all the guys they signed wouldn't have gone there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big East, if you finish in the top five or six, you're in the (NCAA) 
tournament, and the Big East is on TV so much, all of a sudden, you have 
national exposure. It's a completely different program." 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb said he liked the Notre Dame coaches and their offensive system. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think I've got a good chance to play a lot all four years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Irish hadn't moved to the Big East? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd probably be going to UCLA or Florida," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod grew tired of hearing such comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be specific and tell you who, but we lost two or three players simply 
because we weren't in a conference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the last remaining independents, Notre Dame has had to settle for 
whatever it could get in scheduling, which meant playing top teams at their 
convenience. And if the Irish struggled, they had little to play for at the end 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing being in a conference does . . . Let's say you have a team that has 
young players, new players or players who are hurt and your team hasn't 
jelled," MacLeod said. "Let's say your young players begin to jell at the end 
of the year, your injured players get back and, all of a sudden, in the last 
four weeks of the season, you start to take off. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have a glossy record, but you're going to a (conference) tournament 
and, by golly, you win it because you're on fire going down to the wire, and it 
puts you into the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could catch fire as an independent and it doesn't make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod discovered this painful truth after the 1991-92 season, his first in 
South Bend after 18 seasons in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were 14-14 and played the toughest schedule in the country," said MacLeod, 
whose team was 7-11 at the season's low point. "We beat Syracuse on the road, 
we beat North Carolina on the road (in New York), we beat UCLA, we beat 
Marquette twice, we beat DePaul." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't enough to attract a bid to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And teams that are not playing in March are soon forgotten by recruits, who 
began to cross Notre Dame off their lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Said MacLeod: "If you look at the teams that are strong, they're the ones that 
are on TV in April: Duke, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, 
Arkansas, Florida now. These are teams that have had big runs and kids at home 
start to identify. They see themselves in those uniforms, playing on that team, 
in that conference, in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a strong bearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the Irish ended their 1991-92 season in the championship game 
of the National Invitation Tournament, losing to Virginia, MacLeod began 
lobbying Irish officials to move into a conference, believing that it would 
give them a better chance at the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like the cards were stacked against being a successful program if 
you were not in a conference," said MacLeod, who had seen the struggling 
Marquette and DePaul programs give up their independent status in recent years. 
"You just had too many things against you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other recruiters would use it against us, and it's a strong argument. And 
plus we had dipped. We hadn't been doing too well the last two or three years, 
and that added credibility to what they were saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're saying the Irish scored a coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for an assessment of the Notre Dame-Big East alliance, Syracuse Coach 
Jim Boeheim said last summer, "It's certainly good for Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Rich Hofmann of the Philadelphia Daily News after the announcement: 
"Cold sweat will soak the pillows of college basketball coaches all over the 
nation this evening. Short of an unexpected letter from the NCAA, their worst 
nightmare has become reality. Notre Dame not only joined a conference yesterday 
-- it joined the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly, no one's recruits are safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Providence Coach Rick Barnes, now at Clemson, said the move 
"immediately makes Notre Dame a top-five program." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be fine with Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese, whose conference 
will now enjoy wider exposure in the big Chicago television market, which 
translates to increased revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are both going to benefit," Tranghese said. "Long term, this is a home run 
for our league." 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, will the Irish be able to compete? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to be interesting," MacLeod said. "We don't know how we're going 
to stack up. We think we're going to be OK, but we don't know. We know full 
well that Syracuse, Georgetown, Villanova -- you can go down the list: 
Connecticut, St. John's -- these are traditionally powerful teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an excellent conference. So, there are a lot of questions. We don't know 
exactly what's going to happen."

THE RAP ON AVONDRE JONES; 'TRAVELIN' WITH RAVELIN' WASN'T HAPPENIN',' SO FORMER 
TOP RECRUIT TRIES CHAFFEY COLLEGE AND MUSIC TO GET BACK TO THE BIG TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Avondre Jones is bent slightly so his bald pate doesn't hit the low ceiling of 
the Eve-Jim Recording Studio in South-Central Los Angeles. Standing in front of 
a microphone, he bobs and weaves as his engineer lays down a background beat 
with the cadence of a bouncing basketball.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones starts to sway. His eyes are closed, his face flushed. He breaks into a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Then come the words in the mode known as freestyln', a spontaneous form of 
hip-hop that is as raw and real as the streets outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be in the Pac-10," he raps, improvising the lines, "but travelin' . 
. . with Ravelin' . . . wasn't happenin'."  
</P>
<P>
 The words reflect the multiple worlds of Jones, who is two years removed from 
Lakewood Artesia High and is struggling to redeem himself as one of the 
country's most promising basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is his music and an upcoming debut album of gangsta rap and 
hip-hop songs for BHE Records, an independent music company in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lot for a 19-year-old to think about. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a bony, 6-foot-11 prep All-American, left USC in May after a 
disappointing freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to be one of the Trojans' best recruits in years, Jones was unhappy 
about his lack of playing time. He believed that then-Coach George Raveling had 
betrayed him. Adding to the frustration was the accusation of academic fraud, a 
charge of which he was later cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 His circuitous route to basketball redemption took him to Chaffey College, 
which was expected to be one of the state's, if not the nation's, best 
community college teams. There he would play and learn from George Tarkanian, 
son of the former Nevada Las Vegas coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, he could play immediately instead of sitting out a year, which 
would have happened had he transferred to another Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
 But one month into the season, the Pirates were engulfed in a community 
college controversy that left Jones wondering how a once-promising career could 
get sidetracked so quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 Chaffey was accused by coaches of trying to intimidate opponents early in the 
season. At the Fullerton College tournament last month, Chaffey players were 
ejected during two games for pulling an opponent's hair and punching an 
opponent in the face, resulting in a bench-clearing brawl. During the fight, a 
Chaffey player took the game clock and threw it on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 That game was suspended and police were called when a Fullerton College 
trainer alleged that a Chaffey student in the stands was making gestures with a 
handgun. No gun was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the tumult, Jones, who was not playing that game because of an 
injury, stayed away for three weeks. Some said he quit basketball to be a rap 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he was rehabilitating a severely sprained ankle that was injured 
during practice when he landed wrong after a rebound. He returned last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones hopes Chaffey is a temporary stop on his way back to Division I. 
Although the incidents have bothered him, he says he is focusing on next season 
when he expects to play at either UNLV, Providence, Iowa or Georgia. Many say 
Las Vegas is his top choice, where he can play for Tim Grgurich, a Jerry 
Tarkanian protege. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones says he has not decided where he will play, but there are a few signals. 
One day last month in the Pirate gymnasium, Jones was approached by the man he 
had once hoped to play for at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy could be as good as he wants to be," Jerry Tarkanian told a 
reporter, who was interviewing Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian turned to Jones, as wide-eyed as a mule deer: "I'm shocked at the 
things you can do. Shocked!"  
</P>
<P>
 Turning away, Tark continued: "He needs to be constantly motivated."  
</P>
<P>
 Jones shook his head as if he has heard this 10 zillion times. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The motivation) doesn't last long because of all the things you're 
interested in," Tarkanian told him. "That was the same thing with (San Antonio 
Spurs) David Robinson.  
</P>
<P>
 "But when you make $5 million a year like David you can be interested in a lot 
of things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Jones decided to attend Chaffey, located in the shadow of the San Gabriel 
Mountains in Rancho Cucamonga, he was concerned some might think he went to a 
community college because of poor grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones left USC with a 2.2 grade-point average on a 4.0 scale for 31 units. 
George Tarkanian says Jones needs 10 units to earn an Associate Arts degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jones was in good academic standing at USC, Educational Testing 
Services, which administers the Scholastic Aptitude Test, accused him of 
cheating on his entrance exam. An investigation cleared him of wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
 The challenge came during the second semester when NCAA investigators were 
tipped that Jones' test score improved by almost 500 points after taking the 
SAT at Lynwood High about eight months earlier. Jones' first test score was 
about 60 points shy of the mandatory 700 to be eligible to compete in 
intercollegiate athletics as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA turned over its findings to ETS, then backed off the inquiry.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was ridiculous," said Jones' mother, Vivian Ruffin. "They had no grounds 
for doing that. He went through a whole year of college.  
</P>
<P>
 "He took the test twice and USC didn't have a problem with it because it went 
through (admissions) as normal."  
</P>
<P>
 Big increases in scores often are flagged by testing agencies or colleges. But 
after reviewing Jones' high school transcripts and interviewing him, the USC 
admissions office accepted the increase without question.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones is at least the fourth USC recruit who has had an entrance exam 
challenged in the last two years. But Jones says he did not leave the school 
because of the test challenge.  
</P>
<P>
 He says he thought last season was wasted and he did not develop his 
basketball skills. He also thought Raveling misled him during recruiting, as he 
expected to start as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what he told me in my living room, so I don't know how to take it," 
Jones said. "He probably didn't think I was ready, but I did."  
</P>
<P>
 Raveling told Jones to be patient saying his time would come. But Jones was 
not sure.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones was one of four heralded freshman in Raveling's 1993 recruiting class. 
The others were Stais Boseman, Claude Green and Jaha Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones was considered the first dominant center to arrive at USC in Raveling's 
eight seasons. He averaged 21.2 points and 11.7 rebounds as a senior, who along 
with Charles O'Bannon led Artesia to its third State title in four seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who retired last month after a serious car accident, said he would 
probably handle Jones differently if he had another chance.  
</P>
<P>
 "The expectations by Vonnie, by me, by everybody were so high maybe it was 
unrealistic to think he could achieve so much so quickly," Raveling said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I accept a large part of the blame because we hyped those four kids so much. 
But when you have a program like ours trying desperately to get into the 
spotlight there is a tendency to oversell. I plead guilty to that."  
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who says he and Raveling had an amicable parting, started one of 23 
games for USC. He averaged 3.8 points, 3.1 rebounds and 13 minutes of playing 
time. He lost his confidence and started missing practices and team meetings. 
That frustrated coaches.  
</P>
<P>
 He was suspended twice, including a National Invitational Tournament game 
against Fresno State.  
</P>
<P>
 "I probably went to (USC) for the wrong reasons," Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' decision to stay in Southern California was motivated in part by his 
desire to be near the recording scene and home.  
</P>
<P>
 Some coaches think he would be better off playing in a small college town away 
from the distractions of the recording industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have his heart into it," said Gary Anderson, coach of defending 
state champion Long Beach City. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks a little lethargic," another coach said of his play at Chaffey. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first game back from the ankle injury, Jones scored 10 points, had 11 
rebounds and eight blocks as Chaffey defeated Golden West College.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like the world is against me," he said. "Just negative, negative, 
negative . . . it is motivating me to prove they are wrong."  
</P>
<P>
 Jones has been criticized for his work in hip-hop, perhaps because some 
coaches do not connect with the music. It frustrates him that people say he has 
given up on basketball to become a recording artist.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one should put all their marbles on a sport," Jones said. "You should 
always have something to fall back on."  
</P>
<P>
 The way his basketball career has gone, it is difficult to blame him.  
</P>
<P>
 "The music worked its way when he got frustrated with what was going on at 
USC," Ruffin said.  
</P>
<P>
 She is impressed with how her son has handled school, basketball and a budding 
rap career, but has some doubts.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a little much for one person as young as he is," Ruffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones says basketball comes first, but, "Maybe because I'm seven feet they 
think that's the only thing I'm supposed to do. Just like everybody else I have 
other interests.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you can't play basketball anymore, you can still roll your wheelchair 
into that recording booth and rap."  
</P>
<P>
 Jones also has faced resentment within the hip-hop scene. Some do not take him 
seriously because he looks more like an athlete than an artist.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's just as good a rapper as he is a basketball player," said Earl Sisson, 
his manager. "There's not a 6-11 guy delivering the kind of street lyrics that 
Avondre does."  
</P>
<P>
 Although his words are profane and sometimes sexist, they do not promote 
violence.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones, known as "Shicty" in the music industry, started rapping with Carlos 
Bright when they were sophomores at Artesia. They began by making up rhymes at 
a friend's house, laughing themselves silly.  
</P>
<P>
 They started performing at lunch on campus, entertaining Artesia's students. 
Jones, the lanky giant, gained quiet confidence next to the compact Bright.  
</P>
<P>
 Often soft-spoken and shy, Jones delivers his lyrics with a powerful voice 
that is spiked with anger and humor.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hankins of BHE Records wants him to record clean versions of his songs so 
they will reach a greater audience. Gangsta rap is a form of popular music that 
often uses street language to depict the realities of life in poor 
neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 Hankins thinks Jones has crossover potential. He is from the 'hood, but 
because of basketball, he can cross ethnic and economic boundaries. Along with 
the album, "Shicty," due in early January, will be a video, posters and singles 
-- the whole force of a Hollywood promotion.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones is one of perhaps 500 new recording artists in Los Angeles trying to 
make it big. But it is doubtful the others also are striving to reach the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
 Next time, Jones will record with Bright so he will have more time for 
basketball. The album took more than three months to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 When working together, Jones and Bright are known as 3Wayz. Funny name. But it 
personifies Jones these days, who is divided among basketball, school and rap.  
</P>
<P>
 Can he do it all? Jones thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to get my respect back," he said. "A lot of people are doubting me."

EXPLORER REACHES PEAK BEFORE 89TH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only days shy of his 89th birthday, explorer Norman Vaughn reached the summit 
of the 10,300-foot-high Antarctic mountain that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, who turns 89 Monday, and his team spent Friday night atop Mount 
Vaughan, expedition organizers said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1928, Vaughan joined Adm. Richard E. Byrd's South Pole expedition as a 
22-year-old Harvard dropout and became the first American to drive dogs in the 
Antarctic. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Byrd who named the Queen Maud Mountains peak in Vaughan's honor.

LYGHT GOES ON, BUT OTHERS SIT WHILE YOUNG RAMS PLAY BEARS; PRO FOOTBALL: 
DEFENSIVE BACK SAYS TEAM IS BETTER THAN 'TERRIBLE' 1991 CLUB AS IT TRIES TO 
SNAP FIVE-GAME LOSING STREAK IN CHICAGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram cornerback Todd Lyght was only a rookie in 1991, when the Rams lost their 
final 10 games in John Robinson's last season as the team's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years older and wiser, does Lyght see any similarities between the 1991 
Rams and the Rams who can stretch their losing streak to six with a loss at 
Chicago today? 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," he said. "The '91 team was terrible. This year's team just isn't 
winning. We've got the players who can win, we're just not getting the job 
done. We've lost some close games and had some total breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we do have the talent to win here. We do. But that '91 team, there wasn't 
enough talent to win anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght is one of only four defensive starters from the 1991 team still with the 
Rams, along with defensive ends Robert Young and Gerald Robinson (now a backup) 
and cornerback Darryl Henley. Left guard Tom Newberry, wide receiver Flipper 
Anderson and right tackle Jackie Slater (now a backup) are the only offensive 
starters left from that team. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett, Henry Ellard, Kevin Greene and Duval Love are gone. So is 
Robinson, who was replaced by Chuck Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Knox was answering questions about his future as Ram coach, just as 
Robinson did three seasons earlier. Ram President John Shaw has said Knox's 
future -- he has one year remaining on his four-year deal -- will be discussed 
after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has maintained all season that the team's possible move to St. Louis has 
no impact on the players and the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But his theory has been frayed at the edges lately, with free safety Anthony 
Newman wondering if talk of the move has been a distraction in a 4-10 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough," Newman said. "We're emotionally drained because of our record, 
and who knows what is going to happen with the team and coaching staff? 
</P>
<P>
 "People on the team keep saying it's not a distraction. But deep down, it is. 
It helps when you have a team with stability on where they're going to be and 
the coaching staff is going to be there for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't use this as an excuse, though. It's not an excuse for us losing 
those games." 
</P>
<P>
 A victory in Chicago Sunday would be the Rams' first there since 1986 and 
would be a major blow to the Bears' playoff hopes. Chicago (8-6) trails NFC 
Central leader Minnesota by one game and can clinch a playoff berth with a 
victory, combined with either a Green Bay loss to Atlanta or a Philadelphia-New 
York Giants tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will contend with a Bear defense that has allowed only 10.3 points a 
game in the eight victories but 34.8 points a game in the six losses. 
</P>
<P>
 With wind and temperatures in the 30s expected for game time, don't expect 
quarterback Chris Chandler to be testa Bear pass defense that allows only 187 
yards a game, fourth-best in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 But tailback Jerome Bettis, who has averaged only 31 yards in 12 carries the 
last five games, goes against a Bear rush defense that has allowed 128 yards a 
game (27th in the league). Bettis rushed for 146 yards in 39 carries in a 20-6 
victory over the Bears in last year's finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were eliminated from the playoff race with last week's loss at Tampa 
Bay and are using the final two games to give some of their younger players 
playing time for evaluation purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams pulled Newman from the starting lineup in favor of rookie strong 
safety Toby Wright, a second-round pick from Nebraska. Marquez Pope, the 
starting strong safety, will move to Newman's position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also plan to give rookie free safety Keith Lyle, who has been used in 
nickel packages, more work on first and second downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "These next two games are not just important, they're critical," said Joe 
Vitt, assistant head coach. "An important part of football is that you can't 
let yourself make any mistakes on personnel. If you go into the off-season not 
knowing what certain players can do, then you're behind the eight-ball. You 
can't compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young kids have worked hard all year and played well on special teams and 
deserve an opportunity to play on defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Vitt was asked what impact a losing season has on the Rams' younger players, 
especially those who came from winning college programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a 4-12 season, it has an impact on everyone," he said. "I 
don't know of anyone who can stay at this level if you have many seasons like 
that."

SEVEN TO BE INDUCTED INTO O.C. HALL OF FAME TODAY 
</P>

 Former Angel stars Nolan Ryan and Brian Downing, and track stars Mary Decker 
Slaney and Steve Scott are among the seven athletes entering the Orange County 
Sports Hall of Fame today. Ceremonies begin at 1 p.m. in the Hall of Fame patio 
at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Other honorees include former Ram lineman Rich Saul, boxer and referee George 
Latka and tennis champion Josephine Cruickshank. 
</P>
<P>
 Downing, who spent 13 of his 20 seasons with the Angels, holds 10 of the 
team's 12 individual career records and is the only player to have been on all 
three of the Angels' division winners. Ryan, an Angel from 1972-79, holds six 
Angel all-time pitching records and is the majors' all-time leader in 
strikeouts (5,714) and no-hitters (7). 
</P>
<P>
 Slaney was a three-time Olympian, and at one time held every American record 
from the 800 meters to the 10,000 meters. Scott ran more sub-four minute miles 
(135) than any runner and was a three-time Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul was a six-time Pro Bowl selectee who once started 176 consecutive games 
for the Rams. Latka was the Pacific Coast lightweight champion in the early 
1940s, and is in the Boxing Hall of Fame as a fighter and referee. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruickshank was the Southern California women's singles champion in 1933, and 
won numerous doubles ribbons playing with Midge Gladman from 1972-35. She 
played on the Wrightman Cup team as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, four others will receive special recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Murphy, who helped to start the American Basketball Assn. and the World 
Hockey Assn., will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Kennedy, chairperson of the board of First American Financial 
Corporation, its principal subsidiary First American Title Insurance, and 
captain of the 1939 Stanford golf team, receives the Distinguished Citizen 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Bethel, who set a national record for 13- and 14-year-olds last July in 
the pentathlon despite losing a right eye after being struck by an errant golf 
ball, is the Courage Award winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Bryant, lifetime Rams' booster who helped bring the Disneyland Pigskin 
Classic to Anaheim, will receive the Good Guy Award.

 T his week in the NFL . . .  
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO -- The trash-talking Rams meet their match at Soldier Field, where 
Chicago Bear offensive linemen begin to loudly chant, "5-11! 3-13! 6-10! 5-11! 
4-10!" -- the Rams' won-lost records for the past five seasons. 
Discombobulated, the Rams lose, 24-0, as Jerome Bettis, needing 30 yards to 
reach 1,000 for the season, is held to 29 yards in 39 carries. After the game, 
Ram trainers pry loose the hands cupped over the ears of safety Toby Wright and 
wrap his shivering body in a flannel blanket. "He's a rookie," veteran Anthony 
Newman explains. "He's never heard anything like this. People talk trash in 
college, but there, at least, they have a code of decency." 
</P>

 SEATTLE -- The Raiders edge the Seahawks, 8-7, to remain in playoff contention 
despite a sub-par seven penalties, leaving them at 147 for the season, one shy 
of the 1989 Houston Oilers' all-time record. Raider Coach Art Shell, trying to 
hide his disappointment, sets his jaw and tells reporters, "We always said this 
thing would go right down to the wire." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Amid intermittent hail, sleet, snow and boos, the 
Chargers lose to the Jets at Giants Stadium, 2-0, continuing their quest to 
become the league's first team to open a season 6-0 and then miss the playoffs. 
In San Diego, weekend-long partying over the announcement of Tom Werner's sale 
of the Padres ends abruptly at 1:01 p.m. (PST). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 PITTSBURGH -- The two best teams in the AFC meet at Three Rivers Stadium, 
pitting Vinny Testaverde against Neil O'Donnell at quarterback, Leroy Hoard 
against John L. Williams at best available running back and Derrick Alexander 
against Yancey Thigpen at go-to wide receiver. In San Francisco, post-Super 
Bowl ticker-tape parade tickets go on sale.

 PHILADELPHIA -- For the second time in four seasons, quarterback Randall 
Cunningham is benched by the Philadelphia Eagles' head coach. Then it was Buddy 
Ryan; it is Rich Kotite today. After the game, Cunningham announces he's 
accepting applications for new Philadelphia Eagles head coach and will 
interview a short list of five candidates some time in January. 
</P>

<P>
 TEMPE, Ariz. -- Today's victory by the Cardinals over the Bengals, coupled 
with one more Arizona victory next Saturday against Atlanta, will send Buddy 
Ryan's team to the NFC playoffs with a 9-7 record. The Rams, who beat Arizona 
amid much anti-Ryan crowing on opening day, have no comment, seeing as how they 
were eliminated from NFC playoff consideration seven days ago.

 ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Drew Bledsoe throws for three touchdowns and Marion 
Butts runs for two more as New England defeats Buffalo, 35-31, to eliminate the 
Bills from the AFC playoff race. "You have liberated the Super Bowl and saved 
this country's national pastime," President Clinton tells the winners in 
postgame conference calls. "Truer Patriots this nation has never known."

 WASHINGTON. -- Today's Tampa Bay-Washington game originally was to have 
matched the two premier quarterbacks in last April's draft, Trent Dilfer and 
Heath Shuler, except Dilfer hasn't been able to beat out Craig Erickson and 
Shuler only recently reclaimed the starter's job from Gus (Rhymes With "Tree 
Rot") Frerotte. At 5-9 and 2-12, respectively, the Bucs and the Redskins are 
jockeying for position in next April's draft, to see who selects Kerry Collins 
and who gets Steve McNair.

 KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- As Haywood Jeffires and the Houston Oilers bid to become 
the first NFL team to slide from 12-4 one season to 1-15 the next, Jeffires 
arrives in Kansas City doing some serious second-guessing over his decision not 
to sign with the Rams last summer. "Could have been 4-12," he thinks, kicking 
himself. "Could have had some stability at quarterback. Could have a nice new 
house in St. Louis."

 MILWAUKEE -- Green Bay plays host to Atlanta in what will be the final game 
the Packers play in Milwaukee County Stadium, and quite possibly the final 
professional sporting event ever held there, unless you want to count the 1995 
Milwaukee Scab Brewers, as Bud Selig sincerely hopes you will.

 INDIANAPOLIS -- The Dolphins, the only team in the NFL where Achilles' tendon 
tears are contagious, make Don Shula the league's all-time leader in 
regular-season victories by beating the Colts today. Afterward, jubilant 
Dolphin players will attempt to carry Shula off the field, will grunt and 
strain, and will finally have to let go of the rear bumper. "I'm going out the 
same way I came in," Shula says from the flat bed of the Dolphins' injury cart, 
instructing Pete Stoyanovich to get in and drive already.

 NEW ORLEANS -- The Cowboys rout the Saints on Monday night, 41-6, and Sports 
Illustrated decides to devote 60 more pages to "Another Week In The Life Of The 
Dallas Cowboys," primarily to push such items from its winter products catalog 
as the Cowboys' Double-Star Jersey, the Cowboys' Heavyweight Double Star 
Jacket, the Cowboys' Single-Star Coaches Shirt and "The Cowboys' Greatest Hits 
On Jim Everett's Ribs, Knees And Backside," now available on VHS.

2 CSUN SOFTBALL PLAYERS HURT IN HEAD-ON CRASH

 Two Cal State Northridge softball players were recovering Saturday from 
injuries sustained in a three-car collision Friday night in Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car that hit theirs was killed. Police said Saturday he had 
been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelby Wilcox, 20, suffered a fractured skull, a broken right thigh bone and a 
broken right hand. She was listed in serious but stable condition Saturday 
night at Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center in San Luis Obispo. She appeared 
to be out of danger, said a nurse in the hospital's intensive-care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Traci Gallian, 19, suffered a broken collarbone and was released 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Morro Bay Police Department dispatcher said Roberto Elizarraraz, 58, of Los 
Osos, Calif., had been drinking before his 1978 Ford pickup traveling south on 
Highway 1 went into the northbound lane and struck the 1991 Chevy Blazer driven 
by Gallian at 5:33 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallian's vehicle flipped, trapping her and Wilcox for about 10 minutes until 
they could be removed by fire department personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizarraraz's pickup also struck the vehicle of a third driver, Richard Olson, 
61, of San Luis Obispo, but Olson was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizarraraz sustained head injuries and died Friday night at the hospital. No 
charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox and Gallian were driving to the wedding of teammate Kathy Blake in 
Atascadero, a coastal town about 20 miles north of San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox underwent surgery for the skull fracture, but did not have any brain 
injury, a nurse in the hospital's intensive care unit said. She said Wilcox was 
awake and eating and might be moved from intensive care today. "She's doing 
very well," the nurse said. "She's a very lucky young lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox, a junior outfielder, batted .323 in 31 at-bats last season as 
Northridge advanced to the NCAA championship game. Gallian, a sophomore 
catcher, hit .188 in 16 at-bats.

WESTMONT STOPS MASTER'S FIVE-GAME WIN STREAK, 93-62 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Oates is usually one of the most media-friendly coaches around, even in 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was obvious that the second-year coach of The Master's College didn't 
feel much like talking Saturday night after host Westmont had dealt the 
Mustangs a 93-62 whipping in a nonconference men's basketball game at Murchison 
Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for Master's (7-3) and was the 
worst in Oates' 1 1/2 seasons at the school. Prior to Saturday, the Mustangs' 
worst loss under Oates was a 98-86 decision to Georgia Southwestern in the 
first round of the NAIA tournament last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just outhustled us, I guess you could say that," Oates said. "We just 
didn't play with the type of intensity that we're used to playing with. . . . 
We had finals this week so we were a little tired, but that's no excuse for 
what happened because so did they." 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing, 42-26, at halftime, Master's cut its deficit to 13 points on 
four occasions in the second half but couldn't draw any closer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs trimmed their deficit to 57-44 with 10 minutes 15 seconds 
remaining when Mike Penberthy hit a jump shot in the lane, but Westmont (6-2) 
countered with an 8-0 run over the next minute and a half to take a 65-44 lead 
with 8:45 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when the game got away from us," Oates said. "We got their lead down 
to 13 a few times and I thought we were going to make a run at them but we 
never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Poor shooting hampered Master's throughout the game, as the Mustangs made only 
35.9% (23 of 64) of their shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Leo Gorauskas made eight of 12 shots while scoring 17 points for 
Master's, but the Mustangs' other starters were a combined 13 of 45 from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 James Mosley scored 16 points for Master's but was only six of 19 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Westmont hit 59% (32 of 59) of its shots and added 24 of 28 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Demers, a powerfully built, 6-foot-6, 215-pound forward, led Westmont 
with 20 points and 13 rebounds.

<P>
 "The way I feel is simple. I don't think anybody in the state can outrebound 
me when I'm at full intensity," Rosegreen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his numbers in Saturday night's final of the Glendale College 
tournament, Rosegreen has reason to be confident. 
</P>
<P>
 He grabbed 17 rebounds and scored 14 points to lead Chaffey in a 95-76 victory 
over Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosegreen, a 6-foot 6-inch sophomore from Florida, finished with 54 rebounds 
in three tournament games, and was named to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 The size advantage of Chaffey and some untimely errors by Glendale haunted the 
Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale trimmed a 13-point second-half deficit to six points with 10 minutes 
remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Chaffey went on a 13-4 run to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a lot of pistols and they don't miss," Glendale Coach Brian 
Beauchemin said. "It's a good combination when you can shoot and you're 
athletic." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward Charles Garcia scored 25 points for Glendale (8-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was fouled on two consecutive three-point shot attempts and made six 
free throws give Glendale a 63-53 lead with 14 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, Chaffey lost its composure and collected three technical 
fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glendale was able to convert only two points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our team they'll (Chaffey) blow themselves out," Beauchemin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think we added to their frenzy by not converting." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffey's leading scorer was Robin Kennedy with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Avondre Jones, the former USC player, finished with six first-quarter points 
for Chaffey.

BOYS' BASKETBALL / LA CANADA TOURNAMENT NOTRE DAME; STEALS WAY TO VICTORY

 It was only a quarterfinal game in the La Canada basketball tournament. It's 
only December. 
</P>
<P>
 And the playoffs? They're a whole season away. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the smile that Notre Dame High basketball Coach Chris Perez wore 
symbolized the importance of his team's 62-53 victory over previously 
undefeated Bishop Montgomery Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our program needed this win," said Perez, whose Knights (6-1) used a 16-2 run 
in the third quarter to erase a 32-25 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, this was such a great challenge. Bishop is known for its great 
defense, but we played some defense of our own tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 And then some. 
</P>
<P>
 Four consecutive times during Notre Dame's third-quarter spree, Bishop 
Montgomery (5-1) tried to get the ball down low to a post player.  
</P>
<P>
 Four times, Notre Dame stole the ball. That, coupled with eight third-quarter 
points by Tyler Murphy, who had 14 overall, shifted the balance of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Anderson added 11 points and David Sobel chipped in with 10 for Notre 
Dame, which will face Harvard-Westlake in the tournament semifinals Monday 
night at 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Price had 12 points and nine rebounds for Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake 74, Moorpark 43 -- Jason Collins had 11 points, 12 rebounds 
and six blocked shots as the Wolverines (7-0) breezed past the outmanned 
Musketeers (9-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Ari Isaacson scored 11 points and Ben Robbins added nine for Harvard-Westlake, 
which led, 53-9, before emptying its bench. Stephen Jennings and Brian Fortman 
scored eight points each for Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-10 Collins, who had six points, nine rebounds and five blocked 
shots at the end of the first quarter, played sparingly the rest of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were a little bit intimidated and their shots were a little flat," said 
Harvard-Westlake Coach Greg Hilliard said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're a pretty big team, and if you haven't practiced against people with our 
size, it could be tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins' twin brother Jarron, who is 6-foot-9, was also a factor in the 
victory with eight points, seven rebounds and three blocked shots. 
</P>

 Alemany 60, Campbell Hall 49 -- Adrian Pantoja scored 17 points and Mario 
Thompson had 16 to for the Indians (4-4).

4:45 p.m.

Francis became the third Mission League team to reach the semifinals, knocking 
the Spartans out of championship contention. James Alvarez added 15 points for 
St. Francis (4-2).

<P>
 Charlie Petit had 16 points for La Canada (4-4).

A SEASON FOR HIS FATHER; SYLMAR'S SEIDLER VOWED TO WIN TITLE AFTER DAD'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 James Seidler's nerves were raw. The earth continued to shake beneath him 
without warning. 
</P>
<P>
 His family's home was in shambles. The kitchen was a mess. Broken glass was 
everywhere. Sirens screamed in the distance. And there was no help in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the chaos caused by January's 6.8 earthquake lay James' father, Emil 
Seidler, on the living-room floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his favorite recliner, Emil Seidler suffered a heart attack about 9 
a.m. on Jan. 17, while James and his mother, Kathleen, worked to clean the 
kitchen. Despite the efforts of James and a neighbor, who performed 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Emil for 15 minutes, Emil died. 
</P>
<P>
 An ambulance arrived about an hour later. The coroner followed at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar High's 38-6 victory over Crenshaw in the City Section 4-A Division 
championship game last week was bittersweet for James, a Spartan senior 
linebacker who knocked down two passes in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Emil Seidler, who was 65, is the reason his son James donned football pads for 
the first time, in his sophomore year. James didn't like football -- and he 
certainly didn't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one that drove me to play football," said James, who was content 
playing baseball and basketball until his father began the prodding. "One day 
he sat me down and said, 'Are you gonna play football?' But it was more like, 
'You are gonna play football, right?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Despite James' initial ignorance of the game, he flourished at Sylmar as a 
two-way starter at outside linebacker and tight end. And his father, who always 
encouraged his son to "do better," deserves some credit. As punishment for not 
earning a starting position as a sophomore, Emil ordered his son to run home 
from practice every day in order to improve his speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3, 220-pounder improved his speed, not to mention his college 
potential. He is making plans to visit Oregon, Oregon State and Utah on 
recruiting trips. 
</P>
<P>
 But his father's death almost prompted James to quit playing the game his 
father loved so dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a real hard time with school," he said. "I didn't care anymore. I 
didn't want to lift weights. . . . I'd have to drag myself to practice." 
</P>
<P>
 James was clearly depressed and withdrew from classmates and friends. He 
frequently skipped class, opting instead to stay home and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit him pretty hard," Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman said. "He just kind of 
moped around and really, he's an outgoing type of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 James refused to talk to family or friends about his father's death until his 
older brother Todd encouraged him to refocus his anguish and dedicate the 
season to his father, who had anticipated a prosperous year for his youngest 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really looking forward to it, especially with all the colleges looking 
at me," James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once James committed himself to winning a City title for his father, 
everything started to fall into place. "He started to lose himself in 
(football)," Engilman said. "He started working out real hard. And maybe that 
is what drove him so hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to let a kid work his way through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a separated right shoulder, which he injured in practice in 
mid-October, James missed only one game this season, remained focused on his 
task and recorded 11 sacks. As a reminder and personal tribute, Seidler wrote 
in big black letters on his taped wrists for every game the word 'DAD' and the 
acronym 'DIFD,' which reminded James that he was "Doing It For Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Emil was not in attendance for the championship game last weekend, 
James would like to think he was there in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the fourth quarter, James left the field when his injured right 
shoulder popped out. After a doctor tended to his shoulder, James had the 
feeling that his father was not pleased that his son was sitting on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was sitting on my shoulder, saying, 'Get back in there,' " James 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Off he went, back into the game his father wanted him to play.

REFERENDUM MAY KILL OTHER NORTHRIDGE PROGRAMS; BUDGET: ATHLETIC DIRECTOR SAYS 
THAT WITHOUT A FEE HIKE, THE UNIVERSITY WILL FIELD JUST 14 PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Football, women's basketball, men's soccer and men's swimming are among the 
Cal State Northridge programs that could be terminated if a key student fee 
referendum in March fails, Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said that if the measure fails, Northridge would field only 14 
programs, the minimum number necessary to remain at the NCAA Division I level. 
Northridge now fields 18 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't have enough money to operate, then we have to make tough 
decisions," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Northridge's third attempt in a year to pass an athletic referendum 
could mean life or death for four Northridge programs. When the Associated 
Students election is held March 8-9, the potential price tag for students may 
not be as high. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, students were asked to pay $49 per semester for athletics and the 
measure was narrowly defeated in the largest election turnout in school 
history. A similar proposal was defeated last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Northridge President Blenda J. Wilson told athletics administrators and 
coaches on Friday that she hopes to maintain the current level of funding from 
the University Corporation, formerly called the Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson delivers the Corporation funding -- which amounts to $225,000 for 
1994-95 -- the referendum's financial impact on students will be lessened. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three referendum packages are being considered. The referendum 
options will contain different dollar figures and athletic configurations. 
</P>
<P>
 The choices: 
</P>
<P>
 * With a semester fee increase of $26 per student, no programs would be 
eliminated and the level of funding across the board would increase. 
</P>
<P>
 * With a hike of $19 a semester, football would be dropped and other sports 
would receive a slight funding increase. 
</P>
<P>
 * At $15, football would be dropped and other teams would remain at status quo 
in terms of funding levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other programs would be lost if no increase is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is expected to release to the public this week a list of funding 
options for the department, which faces a deficit of $700,000 next year. The 
formal list of referendum selections under consideration may be included in the 
announcement, Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 After soliciting public opinion, Wilson is scheduled to announce in 
mid-January which referendum package will be placed on the ballot, Hiegert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert added that the "indication so far" from Wilson is that there will be 
no more referendum attempts if the March measure fails.

GRANDMA HITS: THE SAUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY ROSBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was growing up, my family often spent part of the holidays at my 
grandmother's in a little town in southern Mississippi, just north of New 
Orleans. My grandmother, who was a celebrated cook, loved to entertain and 
especially liked to plan Christmas menus. Her golden roasted turkey served with 
sage corn bread dressing, her glazed sweet potatoes and her incredibly dense 
fruitcakes and made-from-scratch coconut cakes were among the delicious dishes 
set at her table. 
</P>
<P>
 My fondest memory, however, is of her cranberry sauce, which she festively 
served in scooped-out orange halves. Deep-crimson in color and scented 
intensely with the flavor of orange, it was a family favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of her generation, my grandmother never cooked from recipes, so she 
did not leave behind any written record of her special cranberry sauce. Several 
years ago I decided to try to reproduce this irresistible condiment and created 
a close facsimile. My version is made by simmering cranberries in sugar and 
water along with orange juice and grated orange zest. After the sauce has 
thickened, I stir in slivered almonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I too serve this side dish in hollowed-out orange halves, but it could also be 
placed in a clear glass bowl and placed on a plate lined with dark-green, shiny 
lemon leaves. The sauce, which can be completely prepared three days ahead, 
makes a fine accompaniment to all roasted poultry and is equally good with 
roast pork or sauteed pork chops. ORANGE-ALMOND CRANBERRY SAUCE 1 pound 
cranberries, picked over, rinsed and drained, to equal about 4 1/2 cups 2 cups 
sugar 1/2 cup water 2 teaspoons grated orange zest 1/2 cup orange juice 1/2 cup 
slivered almonds 6 oranges, halved and flesh scooped out, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Combine 1/2 pound cranberries, sugar, water, orange zest and orange juice in 
heavy, medium saucepan set over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, 
until sugar has dissolved and cranberries start to pop, about 5 minutes. Add 
remaining cranberries. Cook and stir 5 minutes more. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove sauce from heat and cool 30 minutes. Stir in almonds. Cover and 
refrigerate up to 3 days. To serve, mound sauce in orange halves or place in 
serving bowl. Serve chilled. Makes about 4 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : 1 (12-ounce) package of cranberries is about 3 1/3 cups.

WHY FRUITCAKE? 
</P>

 A box of Christmas fruitcake is as easy to buy as a box of Christmas cards. 
Fruitcakes are available at local supermarkets, at gourmet food shops and 
through mail-order catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 So why do Christmas cooks feel compelled to bake them? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's partly hereditary: My mother made one so I'll make one too. Or 
maybe it's simply part of the ritual of the season, like shopping, wrapping and 
caroling. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the fruitcake was an ideal winter dessert because the fruit 
preserved from family orchards and kitchen gardens could be used efficiently in 
cakes and other desserts such as plum pudding and mincemeat pies. Preserved 
fruit, glazed and sugared especially for Christmas, was also used to adorn the 
dessert, the most festive part of the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, the Christmas fruitcake remains an icon of the season, 
and home-baked ones suggest you care about family traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 If you hail from an Italian background, you might already know the Milanese 
specialty dessert, panettone , a light egg-yellow yeast cake studded with 
raisins and candied fruit peel that's cooked in a cylindrical cake pan to 
produce a dome-shaped top. 
</P>
<P>
 Another version, certosino , a specialty of the Carthusian monks of Bologna, 
uses honey and bitter chocolate in addition to the candied fruit, almonds and 
pine nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 A Danish Christmas fruit loaf, julekage , like panettone and German stollen , 
uses yeast to produce a lighter version. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the yeast varieties don't need to be baked as early, those I 
prefer can be baked a month or more in advance of Christmas, and when the fruit 
is plumped up with Irish whiskey or stout, they're pleasant reminders of my 
Irish heritage. Early baking not only lets the cakes improve with age but 
signals that the countdown to the holiday season has officially begun. But for 
those of you getting a late start, I've included a boiled fruitcake that can be 
eaten within days of being made. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these cakes can be easily adapted for gift-giving or individual use by 
baking in disposable 5 3/4x3 1/2-inch foil loaf tins. Reduce the cooking time 
by 15 to 20 minutes and test with a skewer, which should come out clean. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 An interesting "boiled" version of this cake comes from Northern Ireland and 
includes a festive and unusual addition of crushed pineapple and Irish whiskey.

CHRISTMAS EVE IN BRUCULINU; AN OILY CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCENT SCHIAVELLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The traditional Sicilian Christmas Eve dinner is fried for a variety of 
reasons. First, ovens were owned municipally, or by the rich; and, in any case, 
roasting is inappropriate for the feast's food, as prescribed by the Church. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, Sicilians take great pride and pleasure in showing abundance 
at the table, especially at holidays. At Christmas time, this abundance 
manifests itself in the use of olive oil, which has been one of the island's 
main crops since the Greek conquest and colonization in the 8th Century B.C. As 
the holiday falls not long after the annual olive harvest, the extravagant use 
of the precious oil is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important reason, however, is taste. There is no other cooking method 
that can turn something as commonplace as cauliflower into something splendid. 
By virtue of extreme heat, the process sears the outer surface of the food, 
locking in its flavor. As long as the oil is hot enough, and its structure has 
not been broken down by excessive re-use, the fried food will not be greasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the same lines, the use of extra-virgin olive oil is important. Though 
it has a lower smoking temperature than many other oils -- and, therefore, must 
be treated with care -- the flavor is not to be missed. Of course, for 
deep-frying, you need not use the precious Tuscan oils that come in perfume 
bottles. Find a moderately priced, good quality extra-virgin oil, such as Fior 
d'Oliva or Antica Italia, and buy a large can. 
</P>
<P>
 The flavor of properly fried food is festive in its tone, rich and subtle in 
its aspect and connected to the ages in its style. 
</P>
<P>
 * To fry artichokes: Set up a bowl of water with the juice and zest of one of 
lemon. Pass a knife through another lemon prior to each cut to prevent the 
artichoke from turning black. Cut off 1/2 inch from the top of the artichoke. 
Peel away the outer leaves to the place at which the leaves are pale green and 
thinner. Cut off the stem, cut the artichoke in half, and place in the bowl of 
lemon and water. 
</P>
<P>
 This seems like a monumental task, but after the first few, it moves along 
very quickly. Add the juice and zest of the second lemon to the bowl and let 
the artichokes soak 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Place a pot of water on the stove with the juice of two lemons and their 
zests. When the water boils, add the drained artichokes, cover, and cook for 10 
minutes. Run under cold water to stop the cooking process. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain the artichokes thoroughly and pat dry. Pass the artichokes through 
flour, egg and bread crumbs. Then deep fry in the same way as the potato 
croquettes. 
</P>
<P>
 They can be fried in the same pot of olive oil, after the croquettes have been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 * To fry cardoons: Carduna , also called in Italian cardi or cardone , is a 
stalk-like vegetable with the texture of celery and the flavor of artichoke. 
</P>
<P>
 To cook cardoons, first peel off the strings and cut the stalks in 1-inch 
lengths. Blanch them in boiling water acidulated with lemon juice for five 
minutes. Drain and, when cooled, pat dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass the pieces through beaten egg and dust with flour. Pan-fry in 
extra-virgin olive oil until a rich, golden brown. Drain on brown paper. Serve 
with salt to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 * To fry cauliflower: Cut away and discard the stalk end and the green leaves. 
Cut the cauliflower in half and cut the florets away from the inner core. Soak 
the florets in cold salted water 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, place a steamer on the stove with several scrapes of nutmeg in the 
steaming water. When it comes to boil, drain the cauliflower and cook in the 
covered steamer 10 minutes. Run under cold water to stop the cooking process.  
</P>
<P>
 Drain the florets thoroughly. Pat dry. Coat with beaten egg and then flour. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat about an inch of extra-virgin olive oil in a skillet. Pan fry the 
cauliflower quickly at high heat until a light golden color. Drain on brown 
paper and serve. 
</P>
<P>
 * To fry fish: I have named several fishes in my article that are difficult to 
find in Southern California. If you are fortunate enough to find fresh 
sardines, be sure they are well gutted and scaled before cooking. Dust the fish 
in fine bread crumbs or flour, and fry in hot extra-virgin olive oil. Serve 
with salt and lemon. The taste is sublime. Whole small red mullet is an 
acceptable substitute, but be aware of the many tiny bones. Tiny smelts 
prepared whole in the same manner are quite excellent and plentiful here. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not recommend the use of blowfish fillets unless you are familiar with 
cleaning them. This fish has a poison sack that, if not properly removed, will 
cause grave illness, or worse, when the fish is eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to sole, our markets are filled with fish fillets excellent for 
frying: red snapper, orange roughy and thinly sliced shark, to name but a few. 
Merely dust the shark in flour, but coat all the others in the traditional 
flour, egg and bread crumbs. Fry the fish in about an inch of extra-virgin 
olive oil at high heat. Drain on brown paper. Serve with lemon and salt to 
taste. POTATO CROQUETTES (Cazziddi) 2 pounds boiling potatoes 8 anchovies, 
chopped 4 eggs 1 cup grated Locatelli or imported Pecorino cheese Pepper Flour 
Bread crumbs Olive oil for deep frying, to equal about 2 quarts Sea salt 
</P>
<P>
 Peel and cut potatoes as for potato salad. In pot boil in lightly salted water 
until cooked but quite firm. Drain potatoes and begin to mash. Add anchovies 
while potatoes are still very hot so anchovies will melt. Continue mashing. Add 
2 eggs, cheese and season to taste with pepper. When potato mixture is well 
cooled, begin to form croquettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Line work surface with wax paper. Beat remaining 2 eggs in shallow bowl. In 
another shallow bowl, place bread crumbs. With floured hands, form small 
handful of potato mixture into cylinder 1 1/2 inches thick and 3 inches long. 
Carefully roll croquette in flour. Place on wax paper. When all croquettes are 
formed and floured, roll 1 at time in egg, then bread crumbs, returning to wax 
paper.  
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 3 1/2-quart pot to 350 degrees, temperature at which small square 
of bread will brown quickly but not burn. Gently slip in croquettes, few at 
time. When croquettes are rich brown, remove from oil. Drain on brown paper. 
Croquettes can be kept warm in 300-degree oven, uncovered, until ready to be 
served. Season to taste with salt. Arrange in pyramid style on platter. Makes 
16 croquettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each croquette contains about: 117 calories; 235 mg sodium; 60 mg cholesterol; 
4 grams fat; 13 grams carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 0.25 gram fiber. VINCENT

CHRISTMAS EVE IN BRUCULINU; A FEAST GROWS IN BROOKLYN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCENT SCHIAVELLI, Schiavelli is a well-known character actor and the 
award-winning cookbook author of Papa Andrea's Sicilian Table (Birch Lane 
Press: 1993). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I grew up in the Bushwick Section of Brooklyn, or as we called it, Bruculinu. 
The Myrtle Avenue El train that passed in front of our flat would eventually 
cross the Williamsburg Bridge, go underground and end up in Manhattan; New 
York, as we called it. 
</P>
<P>
 You might say we were, "only 45 minutes from Broadway," but from a different 
country than the bucolic suburb of the song. In my neighborhood, one imagined 
that if you could ride the subway a little bit longer, you'd be in Palermo. The 
Sicilian tradition and culture brought over at the turn of the 20th Century by 
the immigrants of my grandparents' generation remained intact in my boyhood 
neighborhood of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "La 'Merica" had not as yet diluted it with its interpretation of things 
Sicilian, ranging from the Mafia to pizza. The hyphenate culture had not as yet 
formed. In our household, we were Sicilians first, Brooklynites second and 
Americans only in matters of national allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Christmas time, this Sicilian identity was most in evidence. Its means of 
expression centered around the table. Food is, after all, edible culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In our house, my grandfather, Andrea Coco, did all the cooking. Papa Andrea 
was a monzu , master chef to the Baron Rampolla of Polizzi Generosa, a small 
city in Sicily.  
</P>
<P>
 The culinary tradition of the monzu began in Sicily at the outset of the 19th 
Century, when it was the fashion among the houses of the aristocracy to bring 
chefs from France. 
</P>
<P>
 These great masters applied the French method to traditional Sicilian cuisine. 
The result added to the cuisine a collection of dishes known for their strong 
yet subtle refinement. Throughout that century, this style of cuisine remained 
popular and grew by means of a system of apprenticeship, using native-born 
Sicilians. So, from these original French monsieurs , evolved the Sicilian 
monzu . 
</P>
<P>
 In the old Brooklyn neighborhood, my grandfather's cooking skills were legend. 
On one occasion, a restaurant owned by a paesano of his had fallen into 
financial difficulty. A series of bad chefs and unreliable kitchen staff was 
the cause. Papa Andrea offered to help. He introduced a new menu and attracted 
better staff. He spent long days prepping, cooking and training people on the 
line. Word spread throughout the neighborhood of his wonderful food. Within two 
weeks, the queue for dinner circled the block, and the restaurant was 
stabilized. Papa Andrea was 82 at this time. It's no wonder his cronies called 
him Maestro Andrea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the Feast Day of Santa Lucia, Dec. 13, the Christmas season officially 
began. The first order of business was to prepare the traditional Christmas 
pastry, called cuciaddatu . In the Modonie Mountains, where this pastry 
originated, the poor prepare its filling with dried figs, the rich with 
raisins. In these Sicilian mountains, fig trees are plentiful, and one could 
always find figs to dry. But to have raisins, one must have owned a vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 The raisins are chopped together with a roughly equal combined weight of 
blanched almonds, filberts or hazelnuts and pine nuts. This is then added to a 
mixture of honey, sugar, cinnamon, cocoa powder and Cognac, heated to the 
thread stage. When cooled, the filling is wrapped in a pastry called pasta 
frolla made with eggs and shortening.  
</P>
<P>
 As a boy, it seemed to me that the shelling of nuts for cuciaddatu would never 
come to an end. Everyone in the household did their part. The "shooting" of 
warm blanched almonds out of their jackets offered some diversion from the 
repetitive task, but it seemed as if Christmas would come and go, and we would 
still be at the kitchen table with the nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, this work completed, the candy part of the filling was prepared. The 
house filled with the wonderful aroma of boiling sugar and cinnamon. At just 
the right moment, my grandfather would add the chopped nuts and raisins and the 
whole pine nuts. He then set about the task of preparing a mountain of pastry 
dough. He formed cuciaddatu in long logs, short logs and small turnovers. In 
the Sicilian town of Polizzi Generosa, then as now, the women gather in small 
groups to bake their cuciaddatu in wood-burning ovens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When ours were baked and cooled, the small turnovers were stored in tins, the 
logs wrapped in dishcloths and stashed in drawers all over the house. For some 
reason, the drawers of choice were those containing bed or table linens. Anyone 
who visited in this season left with cuciaddatu in one form or another. 
</P>
<P>
 One year, my grandfather noticed my apprehension at this generosity. He led me 
to some remote hiding place and unwrapped a particularly perfect plump 
log-shaped pastry. With a twinkle in his eye, he said to me in Sicilian, "This 
one, my boy, is for you and me." As a boy of 7, I found the concept of a 
plentiful universe beyond me, but the lesson was understood, and is remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 The week before Christmas, a crate of oranges would arrive. These weren't 
ordinary oranges, but giant sugary sweet navels. As we sat after dinner 
slurping at sections of these beauties, my mother recalled that when she was a 
little girl, her father, Papa Andrea, was given crates of oranges and bushels 
of apples and pears by his employer at the wholesale fruit market. These were 
shared with all the neighbors. She remembered how my grandmother would place a 
piece of orange peel in the kitchen coal stove, producing a lovely perfume 
throughout the house. My grandparents and aunts were enraptured by the memory 
of the simple pleasure, and of a simpler time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before Christmas, reports flowed in from relatives and friends as 
to the prices of essential items needed for the Yuletide feasts. The news that 
certain vegetables were unavailable, or that their prices were "outta dis 
world," precipitated great discussion and concern. Eventually, the news would 
brighten. Although some things remained "too high," we managed. Good news about 
the prices of baby artichokes or eggplant sent my grandfather and me on special 
missions to fruit stores throughout the neighborhood. We kept warm by singing 
Sicilian songs as we walked; we survived the jostling in line from hundreds of 
woman in black by being gentlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 My eldest aunt, Bessie, brought the best news of all. The fruit store at 
Knickerbocker and Troutman had baccalaru for only "49-a-pound!" Baccalaru , 
called baccala or stoccafisso in most of Italy, is dried, salted codfish, or 
salt cod. No Sicilian Christmas Eve dinner would be complete without it. The 
salting process was taught to the Sicilians by the Normans during their 
occupation of the island in the Middle Ages. Scandinavians still eat this 
delicacy they call stockfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Baccalaru is dried in two forms, one slightly softer and moister then the 
other. Both, however, are remarkably stiff. It resembles what one might imagine 
a petrified fish fillet to be like. The fillets are about 18 inches long, and 
six inches wide. The word baccalaru is also a vulgar Sicilian name for a part 
of the male anatomy in a particular state. "Stop standing there like a 
baccalaru !" or "That guy was a real baccalaru !" are terms we can easily 
understand. Baccalaru never entered our house without one of the women giggling 
a reference to this theme. Everyone's favorite story came from Zia (Aunt) 
Valentina. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In her youth, Zia Valentina was a beautiful full-figured woman with a flawless 
complexion. One year she went to the fruit seller to buy baccalaru for 
Christmas Eve. It was sold exclusively from outdoor fruit stands, I suspect, 
because no one wanted the profound fish odor in their shop. Zia asked the fruit 
seller if his baccalaru was stiff and dry, or soft and moist. He declaimed that 
his was always stiff and moist. "Stiff and moist?" she innocently inquired, 
being unfamiliar with the vulgar meaning. He chuckled licentiously. She caught 
his meaning, turned scarlet and stormed off in indignation. Later in life, she 
laughed at her youthful naivete, the blush returning to her still-beautiful 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 The codfish needed to be soaked for three days before cooking in order to 
rehydrate it and remove the salt. This was accomplished in a large-lidded 
stockpot. Mercifully, the strong aroma filled the house only twice a day, when 
the water was changed. I remember one year a relative gave us such a large 
quantity of baccalaru that the only place to soak it was in the bathtub! My 
mother swore she could smell it from three blocks away. All the strong odors 
were gone, however, when my grandfather set his lovely, sublime baccalaru a 
ghiotta (salt cod salad, glutton's style) on the Christmas Eve dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional Christmas Eve dinner in much of Southern Italy and Sicily is 
composed of an assortment of fried fish and vegetables. The tradition has 
existed since the 16th Century when the sumptuary laws of the Church called for 
purification before the celebration of great holidays. Rest assured, the meals 
were spectacular, following the letter of the law, while successfully avoiding 
its spirit. These historical facts were unknown in our house, though. People 
came to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Preparation began early in the morning of the Eve. After the baccalaru was 
cooked and shredded and its salad composed, attention was turned to the 
vegetables. The eggplant was peeled, sliced, salted and pressed to remove its 
bitter liquid. The baby artichokes were cleaned and parboiled as were the 
cardoons and cauliflower. If asparagus could be found, it too needed 
preparation. Potatoes were peeled and boiled, and croquettes formed. 
</P>
<P>
 The fresh fish included fillet of sole, whole sardines, smelts, or whiting, 
blowfish, squid and shrimp. These needed cleaning as well, with special 
attention paid to the blowfish and shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy, I sat at the far end of the kitchen table and watched. Sometimes I 
was given a small task, like peeling potatoes or removing the tough outer 
leaves from artichokes, but mostly I watched. 
</P>
<P>
 My grandfather wore a dish towel tucked into his high-waisted trousers, like a 
great chef's uniform. The sleeves of his flannel shirt were rolled up revealing 
his long underwear. The thing that kept my attention was his measured, 
methodical technique. He would form potato croquettes, each one identical to 
the other, dust them with flour, and line them up in neat rows, like soldiers, 
on wax paper. He would then take them one at a time, pass them through beaten 
egg, then bread crumbs, and return them to the ranks. I loved to watch the 
columns slowly change color from white to beige. As he continued, he treated 
each tiny artichoke heart or cauliflower floret as if it were a small 
masterpiece; as if it were the last morsel of food on earth. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Across this vast country, the Americans were also preparing their Christmas 
feasts. Great turkeys and huge hams were being roasted, large casseroles were 
being arranged and baked. It was, perhaps, inconceivable to them to prepare a 
dinner in practically bite-sized pieces for 20 or more. Then again, in our 
Brooklyn neighborhood, in our flat under the Myrtle Avenue El, we were not in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 All at once it seemed, preparation was complete, the food on the sideboard at 
parade rest in its quiet field and sky of wax paper. Folding tables were set 
up. Together with the kitchen table, they nearly filled the length and breadth 
of the room. They were set under the discerning eye of Aunt Mae, who quickly 
remedied a wrinkled tablecloth, or spotted glass. My grandfather placed the 
baccalaru in the center, flanked by a large platter of green and black olives, 
and a giant bowl of mixed green salad. Aunt Jo came into the kitchen dressed in 
"something Christmasy," her beautiful spirit shining. My grandfather, my mother 
and Aunt Bessie tended to the pots of olive oil, heating for the onslaught. 
Myself and Uncle Duffy, (Aunt Bessie's husband and not an Irishman), sneaked 
olives off the platter. Aunt Jo joined us. We giggled as we avoided capture by 
the real adults. My grandmother watched, quietly praising God for this bounty. 
</P>
<P>
 The door bell rang, and in short order, my grandmother's brother, Ziu 
Giovanninu (Uncle John), and his family and their families, filled our already 
full kitchen. Ziu carried an enormous brown bag filled with bread from the 
Giangrasso bakery. The loaves were covered in sesame seeds, and were still 
warm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The guests unwrapped themselves from their hats and overcoats, and soon all 22 
of us were at the table. We started with the baccalaru , everyone marveling at 
the sweetness and delicacy of Papa Andrea's recipe. Next from the stove, which 
was not more than two feet away, came the potato croquettes, creamy and 
flavorful inside their golden brown coating. 
</P>
<P>
 The furious activity of my grandfather and his assistants resulted in a 
constant flow of fish and vegetables to the table. The slightly vinegary 
dressing on the salad, was an excellent accompaniment to the fried foods. The 
wine flowed, but no one ever drank to excess -- to become drunk would have 
shown a lack of respect, self-control and common sense. Wine was viewed as a 
healthful beverage. We children were offered a splash of wine in a glass full 
of seltzer water. The perennial presence of siphon bottles from the Good Health 
Seltzer Co. at our table did seem rather comic to my child's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation grew livelier and livelier. Gales of laughter filled the 
house. At times it became difficult to hear one of the cooks announcing the 
presence of some new dish. "The blowfish is ready!" one of them might scream. 
My mother might say, "Who's gonna eat the last piece of cauliflower? It looks 
so lonely there on the plate." Understanding her meaning, someone would 
respond, "Why don't you eat it? Gaw-head." At some point during the meal, some 
of the diners would insist on changing places with the cooks so that they too 
could have a chance to sit down and eat. In a room full of Sicilians, 
everybody's a cook. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The meal wound down with oranges, cuciaddatu and coffee. My grandfather cut 
the peel off the oranges for us children in such a way that it made eyeglasses. 
We all looked very scholarly in our "glasses" eating our giant oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Around this time, a party began to form to go to Midnight Mass. In my memory, 
it always snowed on Christmas Eve. Aunt Jo and the others in our party would 
start out for the church at about 10:30 in order to get a good seat. As we 
neared St. Joseph's Church on Suydam Street (which was three blocks away), we 
would encounter the throngs of merry Christmas churchgoers. 
</P>
<P>
 The church itself was ablaze with candles, the altar decorated with a 
multitude of potted poinsettias, in red and white. The creche, which filled an 
entire side chapel, had life-sized statues. The cradle still lay empty. In the 
choir loft, the organist played Christmas carols, and the choir prepared. She 
struck the opening chords of the High Mass, and the service began. It was very 
grand, filled with the old-style Church's pomp and spectacle. When the choir 
sang the "Alleluia," heaven rocked. 
</P>
<P>
 To this accompaniment, the priests and altar boys formed a procession, 
carrying the statue of the Baby Jesus throughout the church, and resting it in 
the cradle in the creche. As the congregation grew excited by the high drama, 
and their breath quickened, the heavily frankincensed air of the church mingled 
with the rising aroma of baccalaru , fried fish and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Aunt Jo and I walked home from church on those bitter cold Christmas Eves, 
our feet crunching on the new snow, the stillness of those nights in our small 
world, echoed the sincerest wish of the larger world -- Peace on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 When we arrived home, my grandmother had hot cocoa and buttered Uneeda 
biscuits waiting for us. My grandfather was preparing for Christmas Day. 
Everyone else, having cleaned up the house, was busily wrapping Christmas 
presents. I tried, in vain, to catch a glimpse of the boxes as they whizzed by. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother, noticing the hour, would say to me, "Go to sleep now, honey. 
Tomorrow is another busy day." Her motherly tone made me realize the extent of 
my tiredness. She was certainly right. As I climbed into bed, I knew that 
Christmas Day would bring my aunts and uncles and cousins and presents; that we 
would sit down at that same improvised table, renewed with fresh linens, and 
eat one of Papa Andrea's meals fit for a baron. I knew that I would wake up to 
the smell of onions sauteing in olive oil; to the aroma of roasting capons, 
covered with pancetta and stuffed with chestnuts. There would be the taste of 
hot milk flavored with coffee and sugar, and buttered toasted Italian bread. My 
eyes would be filled with the sight of Papa Andrea's magnificent rice bombe 
that he called 'a tumala . 
</P>
<P>
 As I lay there in my bed, dreaming of all these things, wondering whether or 
not the snow had stuck, wondering if it was snowing all over the world, even in 
Sicily . . . where exactly is Sicily? . . . my mother's words returned, "Go to 
sleep now, honey. Go to sleep. Merry Christmas." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This Sicilian Christmas Eve dinner is to be served in parts, rather than 
courses. As each dish is cooked, it is brought to the table. Consequently, it 
is best served in a casual familial setting. The addition of crisp apples and 
buttery pears to the cooking liquid is a very old custom that gives baccalaru a 
subtle sweetness that is most complementary. Be aware the salt cod must be 
soaked three days in advance.  
</P>
<P>
 SALT COD SALAD, GLUTTON'S-STYLE (Baccalaru a Ghiotta) 2 pounds salt cod 4 
pears 4 apples 1 to 2 red onions, halved and sliced 6 green Roma tomatoes, cut 
into sixths 1/2 cup green olives in large pieces 1/2 cup black olives in large 
pieces 2 ribs celery, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/2 pound 
boiling potatoes peeled, cut and boiled as for potato salad. Sea salt 3/4 to 1 
cup extra-virgin olive oil Pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Soak salt cod in large bowl with in plenty of cold water 3 days. Change water 
twice daily. Refrigeration is not necessary, but cod but must be kept covered 
in cool place. Soaking will reconstitute fish, and wash away salt. When soaking 
is completed, remove salt cod, rinse under cold water and place on platter to 
drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Peel, core and halve pears and apples. Place in large pot of fresh water and 
bring slowly to boil. When water comes to boil, slip in cod and cook 5 minutes. 
Remove from pot and when fish is cool enough to handle, shred, removing skin 
and bones. Toss with onions, tomatoes, olives and celery. Add vinegar and toss. 
Add potatoes, salt to taste and olive oil. Carefully toss together. Season to 
taste with pepper. Serve slightly chilled. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 544 calories; 1,416 mg sodium; 116 mg 
cholesterol; 26 grams fat; 30 grams carbohydrates; 50 grams protein; 2.17 grams 
fiber. CHRISTMAS PASTRY (Cuciaddatu) 1/2 pound shelled filberts or hazelnuts 
1/2 pound blanched almonds 1 pound, 2 ounces raisins 3/4 cup honey 1/4 cup 
granulated sugar 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa 
powder 5 tablespoons Cognac 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup pine nuts 2 pounds unbleached 
flour 1 cup powdered sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 cups shortening 8 whole eggs 
plus 2 egg yolks, both beaten together 2 beaten egg whites Nonpareils 
</P>
<P>
 On baking sheet toast filberts in 350-degree oven about 5 minutes. Be sure 
nuts do not burn. When cool enough to handle, rub nuts together to remove as 
much of inner husk as possible. Chop together filberts, almonds and raisins. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat honey, granulated sugar, cinnamon, cocoa, 2 tablespoons Cognac and water 
together, bringing mixture slowly to boil. Let boil 5 minutes. Add chopped 
nuts, raisins and whole pine nuts. When well coated, remove pot from heat. Let 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, prepare dough. Sift together flour, sugar and salt. Cut in 
shortening, then cut in beaten eggs and egg yolks. Mix in remaining 3 
tablespoons Cognac. Knead just until dough becomes elastic. Form into ball. 
Lightly dust with flour and cover with cloth. Let stand 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 If shaping into logs, divide dough in half and roll into 2 (1/4-inch-thick) 
rectangles. Spread half of filling down long side of each, roll into log shape, 
seal seam very well, close ends and place seamside down on baking sheet. Brush 
with egg white. Decorate with nonpareils. Bake at 350 degrees 1 hour or until 
pale golden. Cool completely. Wrap in plastic wrap to ensure freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 If making turnovers, roll out dough, fairly thin, about 1/16 inch. Cut out 
4-inch circles. Place small mound of filling on half of each circle, about 1/4 
inch from edge. Brush edge with beaten egg white. Fold over other half. Pinch 
seam together to form tight seal. Place on baking sheet and brush top of each 
turnover with egg white. Decorate with nonpareils. Bake at 350 degrees about 20 
minutes, or until barely golden on top. When completely cooled, store in closed 
cookie tin to ensure freshness. Makes 2 logs or about 5 dozen turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each turnover contains about: 200 calories; 19 mg sodium; 32 mg cholesterol; 
11 grams fat; 22 grams carbohydrates; 4 grams protein; 0.34 gram fiber.

CHRISTMAS EVE IN BRUCULINU; A FANCY NAME FOR CRUMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Delectable desserts topped with sweet pastry crumbs called streusel are 
popular in much of eastern Europe. The crumbs add an irresistible touch to all 
sorts of pastries and cakes, from sweet Russian yeast breads and German 
cheesecakes to Czech apple pies and Polish plum cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The classic streusel preparation is a mixture of butter, sugar and flour 
rubbed together by hand to form crumbs. They traditionally are used to add 
pizzazz to plain yeast cakes. Old-fashioned recipes call for making a yeast 
dough, letting it rise, spreading it in a cake pan, preparing a crumb mixture 
and sprinkling it over the dough. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a much easier way to make these crumb-crowned desserts. You can 
make a pastry base and a crumbly topping from one mixture instead of preparing 
two separate doughs. Simply blend the ingredients for a sweet dough in the food 
processor until they form a friable mixture. Save part of it as the streusel 
topping. The rest becomes the base for a cake when you pat it out in a pan. You 
don't even need a rolling pin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When you would like to entertain with a scrumptious homemade sweet at short 
notice, these crumb-topped treats are a great choice. With this technique, you 
can quickly and easily make enticing cheesecakes or fruit pies. Top the bottom 
layer with a cheese filling to make a cheesecake, such as pine nut and orange 
cheesecake or with sliced sweetened apples to make apple pie. The crumb topping 
is a tasty, delicately crisp contrast to the sweet, tender filling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest way to use this pastry and topping is to make bar cookies. These 
appealing sweets don't even require a filling mixture. After you pat out the 
cookie dough, spread with raspberry preserves, then scatter the crumb topping 
over the top. For even further embellishment, I like to add a layer of chopped 
semisweet chocolate or chocolate chips just under the topping. The resulting 
chocolate-walnut bars are a tempting treat for a holiday sweet table or a 
simple snack with coffee or milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For these quick and easy bar cookies, part of the walnut cookie dough is 
turned into a crumbly topping that is sprinkled over the chocolate-raspberry 
filling. CHOCOLATE-WALNUT BARS 1 1/4 cups walnuts 3 large egg yolks 1/2 cup 
plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons vanilla 2 teaspoons 
grated lemon zest 1 cup unsalted butter, well-chilled, cut into 16 pieces 2 
cups flour, sifted 1/2 cup raspberry preserves 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, 
cut into very small chunks 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare dough, coarsely chop nuts in food processor. Reserve 1/4 cup nuts 
for topping. Finely chop remaining nuts in processor and transfer to bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, vanilla, lemon zest and butter in 
processor. Process with 10 quick on/off pulses, then process continuously 5 
seconds until nearly blended. Add finely chopped walnuts and 1 3/4 cups flour. 
Process 2 seconds. Scrape down bowl. Process 3 seconds or until dough forms 
sticky crumbs but does not come together in ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Place dough in plastic food bag and press together to shape into rectangle. 
Refrigerate 1 hour. Clean and dry food processor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut off 1/4 of dough and refrigerate. Pat out remaining dough in bottom of 
unbuttered 13x9-inch baking pan. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare filling, stir preserves. Spread preserves gently over dough with 
rubber spatula, leaving 1/4-inch border. Sprinkle chocolate evenly over top. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut reserved dough into 10 pieces. Return to food processor along with 
remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/4 cup flour. Process with few on/off pulses 
until sugar and flour are blended in but dough is still very crumbly. Crumble 
dough quickly between fingers to separate any lumps and sprinkle evenly over 
chocolate. Sprinkle with reserved 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees 30 to 35 minutes or until crumbs are firm and light brown. 
Cool in pan on rack until lukewarm. Cut into 1 1/2x2-inch bars in pan, using 
sharp knife. Makes about 24 bars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pine nuts lend an exotic note to the streusel topping of this creamy 
cheesecake.  
</P>
<P>
 PINE NUT AND ORANGE CHEESECAKE 2 1/2 cups flour Sugar Dash salt 1 cup cold 
butter, cut into small pieces Grated orange zest 3 large eggs 1 pound cottage 
cheese 1 pound cream cheese 2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks 1/2 cup whipping 
cream 1/3 cup pine nuts 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare dough, briefly process flour, 1/2 cup sugar and salt in food 
processor to blend. Scatter butter pieces over mixture. Using on/off turns, 
process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons grated 
zest. Beat 1 large egg and pour evenly over mixture and process with on/off 
turns, scraping down occasionally, until dough forms sticky crumbs. Do not 
allow mixture to come together in ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle 2/3 of crumbs evenly in lightly buttered 9-inch springform pan. 
Freeze remaining crumbs. With floured hands, press crumbs in pan together and 
pat 2 inches up side of pan. Chill lined pan in freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, prepare filling. Press cottage cheese through strainer. Beat cream 
cheese with 3/4 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs and yolks, one by one. 
Stir in cottage cheese, cream and 5 teaspoons orange zest. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour filling into prepared pan. Remove crumbs from freezer. Crumble mixture 
between fingers and sprinkle on top of filling. Sprinkle with pine nuts. Pat 
very gently so topping adheres to filling. 
</P>
<P>
 Set springform pan on baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees about 1 hour and 15 
minutes or until set. If topping is not brown enough, broil about 30 seconds, 
checking every few seconds, until golden brown. Cool completely. Refrigerate at 
least 2 hours before serving. Serve cold. Makes 10 servings.

CHRISTMAS EVE IN BRUCULINU; THE SALAD IN BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCENT SCHIAVELLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Papa Andrea taught me, making a good salad is more art than science. It is 
not, however, a difficult art to master.Essential are a good mix of sweet and 
bitter ingredients, such as butter lettuce, radicchio, watercress, fennel, 
Belgian endive and red onion. Be sure the lettuce is rinsed and well dried. 
Tear the greens into pieces; never cut it. 
</P>
<P>
 Place the ingredients in a salad bowl, the bigger the better. Add plenty of 
sea salt and toss. The salt will open the lettuce to receive the vinegar, which 
is added next. Sprinkle enough good quality wine vinegar to have its aroma rise 
from the bowl, but not be overpowering. Toss the salad for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now add the best quality extra-virgin olive oil available. The rule of thumb 
is three times as much oil as vinegar. Toss the salad again. Add course ground 
pepper to taste and serve. 
</P>
<P>
 The result should be neither vinegary nor oily, and the taste of the 
ingredients should be enhanced by the dressing, not overpowered by it. VINCENT

BOOK REVIEW; 2 CUTE 2 BE COOKED; THE VIVID FLAVORS COOKBOOK, BY ROBERT 
WEMISCHNER (LOWELL HOUSE: $25; 302 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to put a straightforward, simple meal on the table in as little time as 
possible? Then don't buy this cookbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to putter in the kitchen, explore bold and unusual flavors, cram your 
pantry with pomegranate concentrate, Chinkiang vinegar, asafetida and achiote 
seeds? Then buy this book. 
</P>
<P>
 Wemischner thrives on complexity and experimentation. He's mad about 
ingredients the average cook has never heard of. He dotes on cross-cultural 
dishes such as "arugula 'Caesar' (salad) with polenta croutons." And he adores 
cutesy recipe titles like "gosh garnet it's turkey" (turkey legs in a sauce 
colored with pomegranate concentrate), "muncha buncha mungs" (bean sprouts in 
lime-ginger marinade) and "my fave favas" (fava beans with charred red pepper 
in lemon-yogurt dressing). 
</P>
<P>
 A chatty writer, Wemischner embellishes recipes with lots of commentary and 
throws in graphic aids like purple blocks of copy called flavor flashes. He'd 
never organize a book in the conventional way, from appetizers to desserts. His 
recipes go into categories such as "Pleasantly Puckery," "Perfectly Pungent" 
and "Intentionally Intense," each with its own glossary of key ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fancy window dressing aside, there are interesting ideas in this book. And one 
can extract usable sub-recipes from some of the dishes. One could, for example, 
make just the aubergines (eggplant) from charbroiled chicken with Afghan 
aubergines or just the chicken, which is flavored with a homemade spice rub. 
</P>
<P>
 And one could cheat by roasting the chicken breasts for "very nearly 
Vietnamese salad" rather than smoking them in a wok as Wemischner instructs. Or 
one could use just one kind of cabbage instead of the three called for in 
"nutty chiffonade of crunchy cabbage." 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly owner of Le Grand Buffet, a gourmet shop in Beverly Hills, Wemischner 
now teaches in the professional baking program at Los Angeles Trade Technical 
College. He's a visionary cook but down to earth in writing recipes. They're 
clear and complete, and each includes serving suggestions, which is important 
when you are dealing with food that is out of the ordinary.

<P>
 Here's a very elegant holiday dessert that is also low in fat: caramel-glazed 
poached pears in an anise-scented custard sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 Small Forelle or Seckel pears are the perfect size for an individual serving. 
Choose those that are ripe but firm. Drain the cooked pears on paper towels 
before spooning over the caramel syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 The syrup becomes hard when cool, giving a great crunch with the delicate 
poached pear. Spoon the nonfat anise custard around the pear then sprinkle the 
ruby red pomegranate seeds over the custard for a final touch of color. 
CARAMEL-GLAZED POACHED PEARS WITH ANISE CREME ANGLAISE 4 Forelle or Seckel 
pears or other small firm ripe pears 1 cup sugar 2 cups water 1 stick cinnamon

from heat. Let pears cool in syrup. Drain on paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaze pears with caramel syrup. Serve pear on plate with Anise Creme Anglaise 
spooned around pear. Sprinkle pomegranate seeds on custard and around pear as 
garnish. Makes 4 servings.

 This is the season to enjoy desserts, not avoid them as many of us typically 
try to do most of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 With this in mind, let us consider some festive desserts that are worth the 
splurge. The following trio of rich recipes work well together on a dessert 
buffet or individually as dessert following dinner. It's a good idea to always 
serve fruit -- as an option for those guests who can't partake of the sweets 
even during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The cranberry glazed pear tart boasts the best of home-style appeal with an 
invitingly subtle range of fruit flavors, layered over pecan cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the mouthwatering caramel-crackle cream-filled puffs look 
professionally perfect, they're not that hard to make. But the various steps do 
take time, each minute worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 The chocolate-walnut decadence is easy to make, even easier to enjoy. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Pastry, pecan cream and fruit all work together here in a most delicious way. 
Although this tart is best served the day it's made, it holds up amazingly well 
without becoming soggy so it's possible to make it a day ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 GLAZED CRANBERRY PEAR TART 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 
chilled, cut in small pieces 3 tablespoons sugar 2 large egg yolks 3 
tablespoons ice water 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 2/3 cups flour 
Pecan Cream Pear Filling Half-Candied Cranberries 1/4 cup currant jelly melted 
with 1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 In food processor work bowl fitted with metal blade, combine butter and sugar. 
Pulse until butter is finely chopped. In mixing bowl, cut butter into sugar 
with pastry blender. Add egg yolks, water, vanilla and salt. Mix well. Add 
flour and mix just until dough clumps together. Do not overmix. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer dough to large plastic food bag. Compress into ball, then flatten 
into disk. Place disk in freezer just until firm enough to roll. At this point 
dough can be refrigerated up to 2 days or frozen up to 1 month, wrapped 
airtight.  
</P>
<P>
 Place dough on floured board. If dough is too firm to roll, let stand at room 
temperature until pliable enough to roll out without splitting. Roll dough into 
circle 1/8-inch thick. Carefully fold dough into quarters. Place on 11-inch 
diameter tart pan with removable bottom, centering point of triangle. Unfold 
dough. Gently press into bottom and sides of pan. Trim dough 1/4-inch above 
rim. Pinch edges to form decorative edge. Refrigerate or freeze briefly until 
pastry is firm. Pierce bottom with fork in several places. 
</P>
<P>
 Line pastry with foil and fill with dried beans or rice. Place tart on baking 
sheet for easier handling. Bake at 425 degrees 15 minutes. Remove foil and 
beans. Pierce crust with fork. Continue baking pastry until lightly browned, 
about 10 minutes longer. Cool at least 30 minutes. Pastry can be pre-baked 1 
day ahead and kept at room temperature, or frozen up to 1 month, wrapped 
airtight. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread Pecan Cream on cooled tart shell. Arrange Pear Filling in spiral 
pattern. Spoon Half-Candied Cranberries evenly over pears. Use brush to gently 
spread over pear slices. Place tart on baking sheet for easier handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake until juices are bubbling around edges, about 50 minutes. Cover edges of 
pastry with strips of foil if they become too dark during baking. Immediately 
and gently brush pastry and fruit with warm currant and butter glaze. Serve at 
room temperature. Makes 1 (11-inch) tart, or 8 servings.

<P>
 Pecan Cream 1/2 cup pecan pieces 1/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 
melted 1 large egg Dash freshly ground nutmeg Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 In work bowl of food processor fitted with metal blade, combine pecans, sugar, 
butter, egg, nutmeg and salt. Mix until as smooth as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 Pear Filling 3 large firm but ripe Anjou pears, peeled, cored, cut into 
1/3-inch thick slices 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 3 tablespoons flour 1 
tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl, put pear slices and toss with lemon juice. In small dish, combine 
flour and sugar and toss pears with mixture.  
</P>
<P>
 Half-Candied Cranberries 2 cups cranberries 1/2 cup sugar 2 tablespoons water 
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 In 1-quart non-reactive pot, combine cranberries, sugar, water, cinnamon, 
cloves and salt. Cook, uncovered, over medium high heat until about 1/2 of 
cranberries have popped. Remove from heat. Set aside. 
</P>

<P>
 These are the ultimate puffs; crunchy, creamy and not too sweet. Once these 
puffs are topped with caramel, they must be served the same day. Keep them at 
room temperature.  
</P>
<P>
 CARAMEL-CRACKLE CREAM-FILLED PUFFS Almond Pastry Cream 1 cup coffee 1/2 cup 
unsalted butter Sugar Dash salt 1 cup flour 1/2 teaspoon maple flavoring 4 
large eggs 3 tablespoons water 3 tablespoons light corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare Almond Pastry Cream and cool thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1 1/2-quart pan, combine coffee, butter, 1 tablespoon sugar and salt. Cook 
until butter is melted and water is simmering. Remove from heat, add flour and 
stir into smooth ball. Return to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, 
until film develops on bottom of pan.  
</P>
<P>
 Transfer to work bowl of food processor fitted with metal blade. Add maple 
flavoring. Turn on machine and add eggs, 1 by 1, through feed tube. Mix until 
smooth and shiny, about 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Use rounded tablespoon of batter for each puff, spacing 1/2 inch apart on 
greased baking sheet, sprinkled lightly with water. Wet fingers with water and 
smooth tops of puffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Place in 425-degree oven and immediately reduce temperature to 375 degrees. 
Bake until deeply browned, about 25 minutes. Pierce each puff with small, sharp 
knife in inconspicuous spot. Turn off oven and let puffs stand in oven with 
door ajar 10 minutes. Transfer to wire rack. Cool completely. Though more 
tender day they are baked, puffs can be made 1 day in advance and held at room 
temperature in paper bag. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare caramel, in small heavy saucepan, bring 1 1/2 cups sugar, water and 
corn syrup to boil over high heat, swirling pan to dissolve sugar. Cover and 
boil 3 minutes. Remove lid. Continue to boil until syrup is lightly colored and 
registers 310 to 315 degrees on candy thermometer. Set pan in larger pot of 
barely simmering water to prevent caramel from hardening. 
</P>
<P>
 Working quickly, use tongs to dip tops of puffs into hot caramel (be careful 
not to touch caramel) and set upright on wire rack. Let cool until caramel 
hardens. 
</P>
<P>
 To fill, cut puffs open, about 1/2 inch from bottom. Remove moist dough from 
center. Use about 1 tablespoon of Almond Pastry Cream to fill top of puff. 
Sandwich it with bottom. Serve immediately or keep at room temperature no more 
than 4 hours. Makes 28 to 32 puffs.

 Almond Pastry Cream 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup cornstarch Dash salt 2 large egg 
yolks 2 cups milk 2 teaspoons instant espresso powder 4 teaspoons dark rum 2 
teaspoons vanilla 1/2 cup toasted almond slivers 
</P>
<P>
 In heavy 1-quart saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add egg yolks, 
milk and espresso powder. Stir over medium heat until mixture coats spoon, 
about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in rum and vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Let custard cool completely. If mixture is lumpy, whisk vigorously before 
using. Add toasted almonds. Stir to combine. Can be made 1 day ahead and 
refrigerated, covered with plastic wrap. Let come to room temperature before 
using. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : To toast almonds, spread nuts in single layer on baking sheet. Bake at 
350 degrees until lightly browned and fragrant, about 8 to 10 minutes, watching 
carefully so they do not burn.

 Here, dark chocolate flavors a moist, dense flour-less cake. Shavings of white 
chocolate create a luscious topping; they're sprinkled on while the cake is 
still hot. This cake is best baked a day ahead and kept at room temperature; it 
takes at least six hours for the cake and white chocolate to cool sufficiently 
to be served.  
</P>
<P>
 CHOCOLATE-WALNUT DECADENCE 3/4 cup unsalted butter 6 ounces unsweetened 
chocolate 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa, preferably Dutch-processed 1 1/4 
cups granulated sugar 6 large egg yolks 1/4 cup dark corn syrup 2 teaspoons 
vanilla Dash salt 3/4 cup chopped walnuts 8 large egg whites 1/4 teaspoon cream 
of tartar 2/3 cup thinly sliced or shaved white chocolate 1 tablespoon powdered 
sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter and chocolate with cocoa in microwave boiler at medium power, or 
in double boiler, stirring often to prevent over-cooking. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In work bowl of mixer, combine 1 cup granulated sugar and egg yolks. Mix on 
high until sugar is dissolved and mixture is light in texture and color, about 
3 minutes. Add melted chocolate mixture, syrup, vanilla and salt. Mix until 
combined. Stir in walnuts. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In clean dry bowl, beat egg whites with clean beaters on low until frothy. Add 
cream of tartar. Increase speed to high. When egg whites begin to hold soft 
peaks, add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, tablespoon at time. Allow each tablespoon 
to be fully incorporated before adding more. Stir 1/3 of egg whites into 
chocolate batter. When incorporated, fold in remaining egg whites. Transfer 
batter to well-greased 9-inch springform pan. Spread evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 300 degrees until edges seem well baked and wood pick inserted into 
center comes out just barely moist, about 45 to 50 minutes. Do not overbake. 
Set on cooling rack.  
</P>
<P>
 Evenly sprinkle hot cake with white chocolate shavings. After 10 minutes, use 
sharp flexible knife to separate cake from sides of pan. Remove springform 
collar. Allow to cool completely, at least 6 hours. Cake is best made 1 day 
ahead and kept overnight at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, use long metal spatula to separate cake from bottom of pan. Transfer 
to serving platter. Sprinkle powdered sugar through fine sieve to garnish cake. 
Cut into small wedges. Makes 1 (9-inch) cake, or 8 servings.

 Sixth-generation Dutch baker Maurius Lakeman runs the Artesia Bakery pretty 
much as his immigrant father did. By 4 a.m., he and his sons Benny and 
Cornelius are already in the shop checking on the proofed bread dough and 
mixing up mountainous batches of Dutch-style cookies.  
</P>
<P>
 Their busy Christmas schedule is even more demanding than their ordinary 
routine. Lakeman gets out the wooden molds his father brought from Holland to 
make the hand-molded anise-cake Santas and extra batches of fanciful speculaas 
cookie figurines. Out in front, where his wife Iona and daughters Rene and 
Brenda-Sue do much of the selling, abundant cookie-filled cellophane bags 
glimmer from the counter tops and a lingering perfume of ginger and cardamom 
suffuses the air. 
</P>
<P>
 As they do each year, the Lakemans have set out their Christmas display on a 
table by the window. The festive setting includes almond-filled pastry wreaths 
gaily studded with red and green candied cherries and almond spice cake. 
Whimsical miniature animals and gleaming fruits molded in marzipan display a 
centuries-old art that captures the magic and pageantry of an old-fashioned 
European Christmas. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 So what is a traditional Dutch bakery doing here on Artesia Boulevard, amid 
the Indian restaurants and shops that make up the section of Southern 
California now known as Little India -- not to mention the Mexican carnicerias 
, Korean restaurants and Asian supermarkets within shouting distance? And how 
does it survive? Herein lies a tale of the Southland's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most people in Los Angeles -- especially relative newcomers -- it's 
probably impossible to believe that dairy herds roamed right past Woodruff and 
South streets not more than 20 years ago," says Lakeman, whose father bought 
the bakery in 1952.  
</P>
<P>
 Lakeman was 17 when his family came from Rotterdam to escape economically 
depressed times in post-World War II Europe. His family was among the second 
wave of Dutch immigrants to settle in Norwalk, Artesia, Bellflower and 
Lakewood; the first wave had come around the time of World War I. With a Dutch 
community that exceeded 100,000, the neighborhood had Dutch churches and 
schools, and until the '50s (thanks to dairy farmers with names like Vanderham 
and Van Leeuwen), it was the largest milk-producing region in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vestiges of this rural past are still in evidence around here: Appel's Tractor 
Service is still located near Pioneer Boulevard in Norwalk, and the George 
Verhoven Feed company is in nearby Artesia. But most of the dairymen have 
either retired or moved to Chino and Riverside, where cows still graze.  
</P>
<P>
 Artesia Bakery maintains a small wholesale business, supplying its wares to 
mostly Dutch specialty shops around Southern California and even out of state. 
But inevitably, progress has changed its clientele.  
</P>
<P>
 Does Lakeman think a Dutch bakery in Artesia is an endangered species? "Well," 
he says, after briefly pondering the question, "in '73 we tripled the size of 
the bakery." An increasingly dense population translated into more customers, 
who apparently approve of the bakery's fresh breads and extremely popular ice 
cream cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But sometimes," Lakeman says with a sigh, "it's impossible to fill all of our 
new customers' requests. They have so many religious and cultural needs -- like 
wanting cake without eggs. All in all, though, we have more customers, even 
though some of them might not celebrate Christmas as we do." Shopping List 
CHRISTMAS ITEMS 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dutch tradition, Santa Claus (Sinterklaas) makes his appearance 
on Saint Nicholas' Eve, the fifth night of December. Unlike Christmas itself, 
the day is not a religious one; everyone celebrates it. Usually there is a 
special dinner and Sinterklaas arrives on horseback with his helper, Svart 
Piet, throwing handfuls of pepernoten (little cake-like spiced anise cookies) 
into the room for children to catch. 
</P>
<P>
 This ritual is still played out in Southern California, staged by the Holland 
Soccer Club of Paramount, which also doubles as a Dutch family social 
organization. The club has three men's teams and women's and children's teams. 
Benny Lakeman says, "The club turns Saint Nicholas' Eve into a very big deal."  
</P>
<P>
 Parents submit their kids' gift requests to the club's shopping committee, 
which readies the presents. Club president Pete Hordyk assumes the role of 
Sinterklaas in all his traditional finery. He throws the pepernoten -- baked by 
the Artesia Bakery, of course -- for the children to catch. Then the good kids 
get presents and (theoretically, at least) the naughty ones get warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Children whose parents shop at Artesia Bakery might find any of the following 
Christmas specialties at their next Saint Nicholas Eve celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepernoten and Taai Taai Santas: Pepernoten may have been the very first Dutch 
cookie. Culinary historians say it was originally just a tiny blob of dough 
that a baker used to test the oven. Pepernoten's unique cookie dough, called 
taai taai ("chewy-chewy"), is made by boiling a mixture of honey, molasses, 
ground anise seeds and cinnamon, then stirring in rye flour. This process, 
combined with the dough's lack of eggs and minimum of butter or shortening, 
produces a cookie with a chewy texture.  
</P>
<P>
 Pepernoten are closely related to German pfeffernusse (both words mean "pepper 
nuts"), but you'll find that Artesia's pepernoten don't have the relentlessly 
strong flavor of their German cousins. The same cookie dough also gets pressed 
into carved wooden molds to make Santa-shaped figures that are traditionally 
placed at the table setting of each guest on St. Nicholas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch Chocolate Initials: Artesia Bakery has sold the Van Der Mere chocolate 
company that it once owned, but still carries the wonderful large chocolate 
block letters that were the small company's specialty. The six-inch-high 
letters are extremely popular children's stocking stuffers.  
</P>
<P>
 Kerst-Kransen: These pastries come in two shapes and several sizes: rings 
(one, two or three pounds) and logs (large or small). Inside a thin wrapping of 
flaky dough is a center of Artesia Bakery's creamy almond paste.  
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the Christmas items the bakery offers all year -- something 
unheard-of in Europe, where the eating of certain foods at a certain time of 
year is firmly fixed by custom. There's one bow to tradition: At Christmas, 
kerst-kransen are sold under their Dutch name, decorated with red and green 
cherries. The rest of the year they're labeled "almond delight" and sold either 
plain or garnished with red cherries. 
</P>
<P>
 Almond Paste: Freshly made in the bakery all year long, the almond paste that 
goes into many of Artesia Bakery's pastries and cookies may be purchased for 
home use. Unlike most commercially prepared almond pastes, which are often very 
sweet and strong tasting, this one, a blend of cooked ground almonds, sugar and 
eggs, is creamy and delicate.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some commercial almond pastes contain too much sugar and will leak out of a 
pastry or cookie as it bakes," observes Lakeman. Having subjected Artesia 
Bakery's almond paste-filled raisin bread to mercilessly high heat, I can 
report that Artesia's almond paste will not leak or melt.  
</P>
<P>
 Marzipan and Marzipan Candies: Marzipan fashioned into figurines has long been 
an essential part of Northern European Christmas. By the way, people often 
confuse almond paste with marzipan; at Artesia Bakery I learned they're not the 
same. Marzipan is considerably sweeter and has the addition of the strong, 
alcohol-based flavoring called marisquin. Lakeman imports this very special 
flavoring from Holland. Artesia Bakery sells both the uncolored marzipan and 
the colored candy shapes.  
</P>
<P>
 Gevulde Speculaas: This dense, ginger-spiced cake has a thick layer of almond 
paste sandwiched between its two layers. When it's sliced, the compact cake, 
topped lavishly with whole roasted almonds, is rather more like a bar cookie 
than a cake.  
</P>
<P>
 Almond-Filled Raisin Bread: Spijsbrood , the Dutch name for this confection, 
is not a very accurate description. This "spice bread" is simply a delicious 
(and not spiced) raisin- and currant-filled bread with a cylinder of almond 
paste at its center. The prescribed way to enjoy spijsbrood is to toast it and 
spread the almond paste over the surface of the toast. The bakery's Dutch-style 
Stollen is virtually the same dough and filling, but formed into the familiar 
flat, folded stollen loaf.  
</P>
<P>
 Speculaas: Recipes for speculaas cookies, with their intricate embossed 
designs, have been closely guarded secrets handed down through generations. 
Along the way, speculaas has evolved from a softer-shaped ginger bread into the 
crisp, spiced cookie it is now. The original cookies were embellished by 
hand-stamping a design onto the dough. Eventually machines were invented with 
bronze wheels that could roll, cut and stamp the cookies all at once. The 
bakery's cookie-stamping machine, imported from Holland, looks quaint but 
cranks out up to 400 cookies a minute, depending on the weight of the dough and 
the size of the cookie.  
</P>
<P>
 At Christmas, people snap up the bakery's large decorative speculaas figurines 
shaped like a Dutch boy and Dutch girl. Small speculaas Santas come with 
peanuts mixed into their dough. Medium-sized Dutch boy figurines and assorted 
small shapes are other speculaas favorites.  
</P>
<P>
 Butter Speculaas: For another version of speculaas , made with additional 
butter, the bakers omit the usual spices. The cookies are more fragile and, of 
course, have a pronounced butter flavor. BREADS  
</P>
<P>
 Artesia's white and wheat breads are fine loaves with a sturdy crumb. On 
weekends the bakery turns out a round French-style loaf and hard-crusted rolls. 
But it's the more unusual rogge rye and raisin bread that make the bakery worth 
a special trip.  
</P>
<P>
 Rogge Rye: This marvelous and unusual dense bread is reminiscent of the thinly 
sliced whole pumpernickel breads of Germany. Lakeman says this version is a 
specialty of Friesland, the north Netherlands province from which his wife's 
family hails. 
</P>
<P>
 The bread is made from a mixture of soaked chopped whole rye and rye bread 
trimmings, baked in wood-lined pans for five hours. I imagine the long, slow 
cooking is responsible for the bread's sweet, nutty flavor and deep color. It 
is a substantial bread that really stays with you, yet has absolutely no oil or 
other fat.  
</P>
<P>
 Raisin Bread: Like those cereals that advertise more raisins per spoonful, 
Artesia's raisin bread has more raisins per slice. Some of the fruity brown 
flecks are actually tinier currants. "They disperse more evenly throughout the 
dough," says Lakeman. CAKES AND PASTRIES 
</P>
<P>
 Honey Cake: This loaf-shaped cake, called honingkoek in Dutch, is clearly 
related to the French pain d'epices . It's made from rye flour, honey and a 
traditional spice mixture that the bakery imports in 57-pound bags. The simple 
formula contains no oil, an attribute that has won many fans.  
</P>
<P>
 Honingkoek: It's often served for breakfast, as we might serve a doughnut with 
coffee. Well, not quite like a doughnut -- it's more like gingerbread. The 
slightly chewy texture softens when slices are wrapped in foil and gently 
warmed in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 Artesia Bakery makes honingkoek in four styles: plain, honey sucade (flecked 
with candied citron), ginger-honey and double-ginger, studded with an extra 
portion of candied ginger. Look for these in the cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 Appelbollen: Crisp puff pastry surrounds a whole apple for these substantial 
little "pies." The apple is stuffed with cinnamon sugar and the pastry washed 
with egg for a golden finish. Appelbollen are another Dutch seasonal treat 
(traditional for New Year's Day) that the bakery sells all year.  
</P>
<P>
 Floppen: Squares of flaky pastry with a fruit or cheese filling, the Dutch 
answer to the Danish pastry. The bakery usually has on hand about half a dozen 
flavors including lemon, raspberry and a cream cheese-laced custard.  
</P>
<P>
 Benny's Butter Fruit Cake: This cake is closer to a pound cake than to English 
fruit cakes -- the ones that are mostly dried fruit held together with a 
smidgen of cake batter. Benny's simple all-butter cake is baked in a kugelhopf 
pan, strewn with a smattering of candied fruits and dusted with powdered sugar. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Oliebollen: The ancestor of American doughnuts, oliebollen -- literally, "oil 
buns" -- look like extra-large doughnut holes. "It's hard to get the inside 
perfectly cooked, so that's probably why someone started cutting out the 
centers," Lakeman speculates.  
</P>
<P>
 They're yeast-leavened, with a few bits of candied cherries and raisins in the 
dough. Watch out, though -- sprinkled lightly with granulated sugar, they may 
look like your average American doughnut, but they're considerably more 
substantial. Oliebollen are traditionally served on New Year's Eve and Day, but 
are also eaten all year round. 
</P>
<P>
 Carees: Somewhat confusingly, these are labeled "almond delights," just like 
the kerst-kransen. They're sophisticated little flaky pastry tarts filled with 
the bakery's own almond paste and topped with apricot preserves and sugar 
glaze.  
</P>
<P>
 Cakes: The bakery does make American-type cakes decorated with aqua-blue roses 
and pink elephants (sometimes). But even these are fashioned from pure butter 
frosting. Cakes here are layered with homemade custard filling, and whipped 
cream cakes get a topping of pure dairy whipped cream. COOKIES  
</P>
<P>
 Artesia Bakery makes about 40 varieties of cookies. In this small sampling are 
a few of my favorites.  
</P>
<P>
 Hern Hutters: It's rare to find a commercially made cookie prepared 
exclusively with butter. The shelf life would be short because pure butter 
cookies turn rancid quickly, especially if no preservatives are used. So, 
butter-lover that I am, I was thrilled to find hern hutters . With their fluted 
shape, these Northern Dutch-style cookies are simply butter-laden, tart-shaped 
shortbreads. They are at their peak for a week or two and they freeze 
beautifully, if sealed in their bag and tightly wrapped in foil. Disregard the 
ingredient information on the cellophane bag. These cookies contain no 
vegetable shortening. 
</P>
<P>
 Butternut Cookies: This is another pure butter cookie, slightly larger than an 
unshelled walnut. Butternuts are sturdy cookies that resemble sweet shortbread 
with finely chopped walnuts throughout. They also freeze well. 
</P>
<P>
 Nougat Cookies: These thin, crisp cookies, with little nuggets of deeply 
caramelized sugar flecked throughout, melt in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kletskoppen: The lacy almond cookies, so thin they're almost sheer, are made 
from a simple blend of chopped almonds, shortening, flour and cinnamon. They 
can bring ordinary ice cream to the level of a fancy restaurant dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympiades: Shaped like a plain biscuit, olympiades are very adult cookies, 
composed of two sweet short cookie layers baked around an almond paste center. 
</P>
<P>
 Gevulde-Koek: Artesia Bakery calls this cookie "almond delight," the same name 
it has already used for kerst-kransen and carees . It consists of four-inch 
disks of soft cookie dough with a slight accent of lemon, filled with almond 
paste. They resemble the small pancakes that the Dutch are said to have brought 
to America. 
</P>
<P>
 Half and Half: Not-too-sweet crisp cookies are dipped halfway in dark Guittard 
chocolate. These delights are kept in the cooler with the whipped cream cakes. 
</P>

CHECHNYA REMAKES RUSSIAN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gregory Freidin, Gregory Freidin, chairman of the Slavic department at 
Stanford University, is co-author of Russia at the Barricades: Eyewitness 
Accounts of the August, 1991, Coup (M. E. Sharpe Publishers). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A subtle but significant change of government has occurred here. The dispatch 
of Russian soldiers and security forces into Chechnya, the breakaway republic, 
and the protest it has caused among supporters of reform and "democrats," has 
realigned the political forces in Russia, more so than did the disbanding of 
the Parliament in October, 1993. Authoritarian rule may be gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 However distasteful many democrats might have found President Boris N. 
Yeltsin's decision to shell the Parliament building more than a year ago, they, 
by and large, closed ranks behind him. Indeed, the confrontation between 
Yeltsin and the retrograde Parliament was the basis for a renewal of the 
alliance between him and the Western-oriented intellectuals who entered 
Russia's political fray in the days of perestroika . It was this alliance that 
helped bring Yeltsin to power as the first president of Russia in June, 1991. 
And it was this alliance that gave full meaning to Yeltsin's fledgling 
presidency during the failed coup in August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But this political marriage has been irreparably damaged by Yelstin's Chechen 
adventure. "The party of war has won," declared Nikolai N. Vorontsov, a 
prominent member of Russia's Choice, the main reformist party, and one of the 
few politicians with a deep understanding of the Northern Caucasus region, 
where Chechnya is located. His expression hearkened back to the years of 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, when the "party of war" referred to those who advocated 
the use of brute force against republics wishing to secede from the Soviet 
Union. Those "party" actions -- like the assault on the television studios in 
Vilnius, Lithuania, in December, 1991 -- made Gorbachev the hostage of 
authoritarian forces. A similar drama is now unfolding around Yeltsin. The only 
difference between his situation and Gorbachev's is that the latter never 
relied politically on the "democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of bitterness and betrayal felt by democrats is almost palpable. It 
could be heard, for example, in Yegor T. Gaidar's frustration in failing to 
reach Yeltsin in order to talk him out of the Chechen invasion. Gaidar's 
bitterness was especially poignant, since he was one of the few to stand by 
Yeltsin in October, 1993, when everybody in the government, including the 
security forces and the army, appeared to have deserted the president. 
Bitterness, mixed with restrained satisfaction, could also be heard in liberal 
economist Grigory A. Yavlinsky's "I told you so," which recalled his year-old 
warning that by endorsing the "lesser evil" of the constitution, the democrats 
were inviting the greater evil of a presidency run amok. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin, no doubt, must feel equally bitter about being abandoned by the 
democrats. To him, their stinging criticisms, coming as they do at his moment 
of crisis, is proof positive that they are ill-suited to become the stewards of 
the Russian state. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Chechnya, Yeltsin was growing more receptive to other voices in 
his entourage, notably those who share his history in the Communist Party 
apparatus and who possess a far greater tolerance for authoritarian methods. It 
should also be remembered that at the height of his love fest with the 
democrats, Yeltsin included among his inner circle his old party friends. Over 
the years, their presence, along with Yeltsin's gradual move toward Russia's 
political center -- and sometimes farther to the right -- has made many of the 
reformers feel uneasy about the president. Add the gradual elimination of the 
most visible reformists from the government, following their failure to win a 
majority in Parliament, and you have the makings for a strained alliance with 
the democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's low standing in the polls and the resulting political, perhaps even 
psychological, need to shake off the lethargy that periodically overcomes 
Russia's first elected President, made the decisive, contrarian move in 
Chechnya all the more irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the occupation of Chechnya is calculated to lend legitimacy to what 
may be a coming shift toward greater authoritarian rule; whether it was a trap 
laid by anti-democratic functionaries around Yeltsin to alienate the 
president's democratic supporters, or whether it was merely an impulsive 
decision made by a man known for his "decisiveness" -- all are beside the 
point. Whatever the case, the outcome is bound to be the same: a presidency 
held hostage to what the Russians call the "power ministries" -- defense, the 
federal counterintelligence service and, recently, the Main Administration for 
Protection of the Russian Federation, the rough equivalent of the U.S. Secret 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 With 40,000 -- and counting -- soldiers from these power ministries digging 
themselves in in Chechnya, their influence on policy will be growing. From now 
on, it seems, elected officials will be playing an ever diminishing role in 
Yeltsin's thinking. The bill for the rushed and mishandled elections, and the 
referendum on the hastily compiled constitution, last December has come due, 
and much of it will be charged to the reformers' failure to win a majority in 
Parliament. They will now be relegated to the status of a disloyal opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two likely outcomes of this emerging political realignment: 
</P>
<P>
 * The strengthening of what is already increasingly authoritarian rule, with 
Yeltsin relying more and more on the administrative infrastructure, including 
the Federation Council, which is staffed with top provincial administrators, 
and the power ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Or some form of the above combined with an alliance with the "center-right" 
majority in Parliament. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for December, 
1995. If they take place, Yeltsin may be able to get the kind of legislators he 
thinks Russia needs: pragmatists tolerant of "forceful" solutions to the 
problems faced by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Much the same can be said of Yeltsin's possible successor, if the presidential 
elections, scheduled for 1996, are held. The present lineup of the more 
electable candidates offers a glimpse of this future leader: He looks a little 
like a Jimmy Hoffa -- earthy, clever, pragmatic, very, very strong -- or, more 
exactly, like a sturdy and head-strong merchant, a khoziain , out of a play by 
the 19th-Century Russian playwright Nikolai Ostrovsky. Their time has come.

THE LEGACY OF PROP. 13 AND ITS PROGENY -- BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cary D. Lowe, Cary D. Lowe, an attorney, specializes in real estate and 
local government issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's historic bankruptcy did not occur in a vacuum. Indeed, the 
financial temblor is, in many respects, a result of the accumulated pressures 
and strains exerted by a tax-weary citizenry demanding ever less costly 
government, on the one hand, without any reduction in public services, on the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen years ago, California voters, frustrated by soaring real property 
taxes and the inability of the Legislature and Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
to agree on a plan to reform the system, approved the Jarvis-Gann initiative. 
Proposition 13 slashed real-estate assessments and severely restricted 
subsequent increases. Two years later, voters passed Proposition 4, the Gann 
initiative, which imposed constitutional limits on how much state and local 
government could spend, regardless of available revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, the financial fallout of these anti-tax measures could be 
contained. The state had enough cash reserves to tide over local governments 
for a time, particularly in the case of school districts, for which property 
taxes were the chief source of revenue. Courts strained to find loopholes in 
the law, exempting such revenue categories as user fees, special assessments 
and certain non-property-tax income. These kinds of fixes, however, proved to 
be only temporary. Also, they resulted in some residents and communities having 
to pay more than others for basic services, thereby compounding the inequity in 
Proposition 13, which favored longtime residents and commercial owners over 
more recent home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1988, California voters acted again, passing Proposition 98, which 
allocated about 40% of state general funds to public education. The effect was 
to further hamstring budgetary discretion in Sacramento. Meantime, income-tax 
indexing, begun in 1982, was reducing state revenues, and federal assistance 
was drying up during the Ronald Reagan presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 In regions undergoing rapid economic growth, including much of Orange County 
during the mid- to late-'80s, the increasing shortage of public funds to pay 
for new facilities and services was partly offset by exactions placed upon 
real- estate development. Approval of new housing tracts, shopping centers or 
office buildings was conditioned on payment of fees or construction of public 
facilities, including not only the traditional roads and sewers, but also 
schools, city halls and recreation facilities. Eventually, the scope of these 
exactions grew to the point where developers were required to contribute nearly 
$20,000 in public benefits for every single-family housing permit they 
obtained. They sought protection in court and eventually succeeded in obtaining 
rulings that sharply restricted the extent of these exactions. 
</P>
<P>
 In areas that were not growing, developer exactions never were an option. But 
in all communities, even in those lucky enough to have developer fees to 
finance new buildings or other public-works improvements, the long-term 
difficulty was in paying for day-to-day operations, including such mundane 
matters as salaries, utilities and supplies. Scrambling for ways to overcome 
their revenue and spending constraints, local governments fell upon an ideal 
vehicle -- voter-approved bonds, debt that was exempted from the limits of 
Propositions 13 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, voters were increasingly voicing their discontent with the 
cutbacks in public services, notably in law enforcement and education. 
Presented with an opportunity to approve bonds earmarked for specific purposes 
-- building a new high school, adding police officers to the force, widening 
streets -- voters resoundingly said yes. By the end of the 1980s, local bond 
indebtedness was increasing at the rate of $5 billion a year. This steady 
stream of money freed up a substantial amount of tax revenues to cover routine 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession that so harshly struck California, beginning in 1990, had a 
major disruptive effect on this public financing approach. Not only did local 
tax revenues shrink further, but voters grew more and more leery of bond issues 
and increasingly rejected them. But their expectations of how government should 
serve them did not undergo a similar correction. Once again, the pressure on 
public officials to find new sources of funds mounted. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, local governments had always relied on interest earned from 
investing their temporarily idle funds, but the changing political and economic 
conditions enhanced the attractiveness of this kind of revenue source. Local 
officials willing to pursue higher-risk strategies -- hence, boost their 
interest income -- took their cue from the successful efforts of the brokerage 
industry, in coalition with certain financial managers, among them Orange 
County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, to relax the legal constraints 
on public-investment options. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy adopted by Orange County -- leveraging its funds by means of 
secured short-term loans used to buy longer-term, higher-interest bonds -- was 
not new. Interest-rate arbitrage has made, and lost, many fortunes. In the 
public sector, the city of San Jose, a decade ago, was on the brink of 
bankruptcy as a result of plying this approach. Now, as then, the strategy 
worked beautifully as long as longer-term interest rates stayed relatively 
high, enabling the county to profit from the spread between short- and 
long-term rates. With rising rates making short-term borrowing more expensive, 
and weakening the value of the funds' underlying bonds, the whole scheme was 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 For awhile, Orange County's politicians and public officials enjoyed the best 
of all political worlds. Soaring investment income -- not higher taxes -- was 
helping pay for wider roads, more school buildings, more police officers and a 
larger airport. In such an environment, incentives to look over Citron's 
shoulder were virtually nonexistent. Nonetheless, numerous officials, elected 
and appointed, should be have been watching over the funds' investment 
practices. Instead, they apparently simply rubber-stamped them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that disaster has struck, perhaps the time has come to open a serious 
debate over the effects of Proposition 13 and its progeny. The proportion of 
the state's population reaping the full benefits of the initiative has declined 
steadily, and residents of recently developed areas, such as South Orange 
County, are bearing a highly disproportionate tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of structural changes in local government's financing methods, 
Orange County's folly will probably be repeated, though perhaps not on such a 
large scale. The political and economic pressures that drove the county's 
managers to place -- and its politicians to condone -- risky investment bets 
have not eased. The real question thus remains unanswered: Whether the people 
of California are willing to bring the level of government they demand into 
line with the level of government they are willing to support financially. If 
the citizens are unwilling to come to grips with that dilemma, then the 
bankruptcy courts will do it for them.

THE POLITICS OF HOPE ('BOYS TOWN') VS. THE POLITICS OF FEAR ('DISCLOSURE') 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sidney Blumenthal, Sidney Blumenthal is the special political correspondent 
of the New Yorker and the author of a number of books on politics, including 
The Rise of the Counter-Establishment: From Conservative Ideology to Political 
Power (HarperCollins). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Newt Gingrich is the World's Foremost Expert. One subject he has made a show 
of having mastered is the movies. Time and again, over the years, he has argued 
on behalf of his policy abstractions with movie references. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's unexpected flourishing of pop-culture knowledge in the middle of a 
policy discussion is a characteristic gesture, intended to bowl over the 
listener with the breadth of his encyclopedic intellect. He's not only a 
futurist, a management consultant and a theologian, but Roger Ebert. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gingrich's proposal to seize the children of women receiving welfare and 
deposit them in orphanages (which would increase the cost per child tenfold) 
received less than universal acclaim, he did not issue a dry document filled 
with statistics to bolster his position. Rather, he urged skeptics to rent 
"Boys Town," a 1938 movie starring Spencer Tracy as the wise and patient Father 
Flanagan and Mickey Rooney as Whitey Marsh, the juvenile delinquent he reforms. 
If his critics could only see the movie, they would be convinced of his 
rightness. 
</P>
<P>
 Why a man born with a different name, whose stepfather was cool and distant, 
who did not meet his natural father until he was grown up and who failed to pay 
minimal child support to the children and wife he left, prompting his pastor to 
raise funds for the family from church members, would fix on orphans at his 
first opportunity to create a public issue as Speaker of the House is a 
question best left to psychobiographers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sheer political matter, Gingrich's use of "Boys Town" reveals his effort 
to package fear as hope. It is fear that drives his politics, but he invokes 
the atmospherics of hope to deflect attention from the motive force. Gingrich 
speaks often of his "vision," and "Boys Town" indeed presents a vision. They 
happen to be opposites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boys Town" is a New Deal parable of hope. The values it preaches are the 
inherent goodness of all humanity and the necessity of mutual obligation. 
Father Flanagan's faith becomes the slogan of Boys Town: "There's no such thing 
as a bad boy." It is only circumstances and environment that make boys bad. 
Brother is depicted sacrificing for brother: "He's not heavy, Father, he's my 
brother." The strong must care for the weak, the healthy for the sick, the 
well-to-do for the unfortunate. When Whitey sees this he puts his self-seeking 
and belligerence behind him. He is no longer a bad boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boys Town," clearly, is not the movie that most aptly captures the sour mood 
that lay beneath the 1994 elections. That distinction falls, in real time, to 
"Disclosure," which purports to be a thought-provoking tale of the tables 
turned -- with a beautiful young woman sexually harassing a vulnerable 
middle-aged man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disclosure" is a parable of fear in the 1990s. The villainess is a woman who 
exists nowhere in a natural state. She is a fantasy predator who will stop at 
nothing: fellatio as castration anxiety. The leading man is hardly the captain 
of his fate. He inhabits a virtual reality of free-floating anxiety. Nothing in 
his environment is remotely controllable. Though he is skilled at his job, his 
workplace is a jungle. Everyone is, or can be, his enemy. The competition is 
ferocious -- and women are the most dangerous of all. Friends can turn on a 
dime; everyone has a price. Families can be torn apart at any moment; there is 
no haven in a world of high-tech survivalism. It's every confused, angry white 
man for himself -- a dystopian "Boys Town." The benevolent paternalism of 
Father Flanagan (and Father Roosevelt, cited recently by Gingrich as one of his 
long-lost political fathers) is not in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope has become a hard sell, especially when gratification cannot be instant. 
President Bill Clinton often laments that his achievements have gone 
unrecognized, and he laboriously makes a substantive case. His program, after 
all, has sustained and expanded an economic recovery. Inflation has remained 
negligible. Taxes have been raised slightly on just 1.2% of the population, a 
thin slice of the upper crust, while they have been significantly lowered on 
the 13% that constitute the lower end of the working class. Federal spending as 
a percentage of gross domestic product has dipped to less than 22% -- a level 
below Ronald Reagan's 22% and George Bush's 24%. The deficit, which seemed to 
be skyrocketing out of control under Reagan, has rapidly diminished. By next 
year, the effect of Clinton's plan will have been to reduce the deficit by half 
-- a feat considered impossible only two years ago. Yet, with all this 
apparently good news, the President's party received its greatest repudiation 
in two generations in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the paradox lies ultimately in the stagnation of the standard of 
living of the middle-income -- a condition Clinton is now attempting to address 
with his "middle class bill of rights." Clinton's previous claims about his 
accomplishments only riled the middle-income, especially white males without 
college degrees, helping to convince them of his hypocrisy. Where was the 
change he asserted he was making? His seeming failure to alter their economic 
estate lent credibility to the personal attacks on him, offering an easy, 
all-purpose explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling as though they were falling through space, they were eager to latch 
onto something that seemed clear and strong. The familiar boundaries of the 
post-World War II had disappeared with the ending of the Cold War. But nothing 
had firmly replaced the settled past. The hopeful public of 1992 became the 
fearful public of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 In this environment, Gingrich's absolute certainty about absolutely everything 
-- which had marked him as marginal -- became a cardinal political virtue. To 
the fearful, the dogmatic can be welcomed as concern, even compassion. It is, 
at least, definite. Fear gets organized when the dogmatic establishes sharp 
polarities -- us vs. them. Rush Limbaugh's comedy of contempt, in which "them" 
are made to seem both ridiculous and evil, helped lay the groundwork. (His 
obsessive conjurings of "feminazis" was an early model of the female scoundrel 
in "Disclosure.") 
</P>
<P>
 In the campaign, profound anxieties about race, crime, immigration and sex 
coalesced. "Taxes" became a chief code-word for a captious politics of 
resentment. It is respectable but easily grasped shorthand for "them" -- the 
besieging parasites and competitors. In this script, hope consists of promising 
relief from "them." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, Gingrich's strategy was to destroy the image of 
Congress in order to rise on its ashes. By Election Day, the Gallup Poll 
recorded the lowest approval rating of Congress -- only 20% -- in its history. 
Race after race around the country was driven to the lowest negative 
denominator. 
</P>
<P>
 Without demons, the politics of resentment loses focus. In 1994, the demons 
included the Congress. Now Gingrich rules the Congress. He can maintain his 
momentum only by governing as he campaigned. His authority as an Iron Speaker 
rests on his ability to keep the polarities razor-sharp. His appeal to his base 
depends on his dogmatism. He is not about to be transformed suddenly by his new 
responsibilities into a pragmatic technocrat, assessing policies on their costs 
and benefits, or into an old-style Speaker, seeking collegiality with the 
minority by granting them their merits. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's sense of hope is almost always ruthlessly reduced to raising fears. 
With his stream of references to the movies and psychobabble theorists, he is 
crafting a post-modern Nixonism. Perhaps we should take Gingrich's suggestion 
that we study "Boys Town." The House of Representatives, after all, is about to 
undergo an unprecedented experiment: "Boys Town" without Father Flanagan. 
Whitey's in charge.

A NATO THAT WON'T RUFFLE RUSSIA'S SECURITY FEATHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger frequently 
writes for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The level of bitter recriminations over Bosnia within the Atlantic Alliance is 
unparalleled since the Suez Crisis nearly four decades ago. Only this time 
there is no unifying threat to impose a sense of urgency to the quest for 
unity. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Bosnian failure demonstrates is not so much the failure of the 
alliance as the penalty of evasion. It poses, above all, these questions: Is 
the alliance still important? And, if the answer is affirmative, will it be 
able to generate common purposes even in the absence of a strategic threat? 
</P>
<P>
 The oft-invoked "new world order" will only emerge, if at all, at the end of a 
period of instability, which is its birth pang. A vital Atlantic Alliance could 
play a crucial role in the resolution of its attendant crises, provided it is 
able to focus on its common necessities, as it previously did on common fears. 
If the enlargement of democracy is to have any operational meaning, it must 
begin with the Atlantic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The nations of the Atlantic area need each other. Without the United States, 
Europe turns into a peninsula at the tip of Eurasia, unable to find 
equilibrium, much less unity. Without Europe, the United States will become an 
island off the shores of Eurasia, condemned to a kind of pure balance-of-power 
politics that does not reflect its national genius. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Europeans advocate European Union as a device to render the United States 
dispensable. In fact, a major U.S. role in Europe is a prerequisite for 
European coherence. It provides a measure of equilibrium by giving France a 
safety net against German hegemony and Germany an emotional harbor as European 
unification slows down, as well as protection against outside dangers and 
excessive European nationalism. Even Russia has much to gain from a U.S. 
presence, which is one of the best guarantees against the re-emergence of 
historic European rivalries. Europe by itself cannot handle the two most 
dangerous Russian contingencies: resurgence of nationalism or implosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the Clinton Administration has been hesitant to give Atlantic 
relations their traditional priority. Many of its key members, having formed 
their political convictions during the Vietnam protests, viewed the Cold War as 
unnecessary and its institutions as potentially dangerous. Treating the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization as a relic of the Cold War, they preferred to rely 
on Russian goodwill as the key to international order. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's new emphasis on Atlantic cooperation needs to take 
account of a number of principles: 
</P>
<P>
 * The crisis in the Atlantic Alliance can be solved only by opening a dialogue 
on fundamentals; previous U.S. vacillations complicate the ability to restore 
confidence. But the task is not insuperable since, despite all controversies, 
the current NATO leaders all have a long record of friendship with the United 
States and, even in France, understand the need for a continued U.S. role. 
</P>
<P>
 * The structure of U.S.-European relations needs to be modified. With the 
military threat receding and the risk of political crises growing, the 
political role of the alliance should be given greater emphasis. In the 
security field, autonomous European military capabilities could prove in the 
common interest because they permit political flexibility in the application of 
Allied power. 
</P>
<P>
 * The most sensitive immediate issue is NATO expansion, which the 
Administration courageously put before the recent NATO ministerial meeting. But 
it must take care lest, in seeking to please every constituency and to respond 
to every pressure, it winds up in the same dead end as Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The new U.S. proposal calls for an exploration of NATO expansion with each 
member of the Partnership for Peace, which is composed of all NATO members, the 
former Soviet satellite orbit and all the successor states of the Soviet Union, 
some 40 altogether. If this is anything other than an opening gambit, it will 
lead either to stalemate or to confrontation. Russia will either veto expansion 
or approve it only if Russia itself becomes a member. In that case, NATO would 
stop being a defensive alliance and turn into a system of general collective 
security similar to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Having started down the road of NATO expansion, the Administration must choose 
between the concept of the NATO Alliance, based on defining an area to be 
protected, and the concept behind the Partnership for Peace, designed to unite 
the former blocs. NATO is not the instrument to serve both purposes. Nor can 
the decision wait until an acute Russian threat appears. Pressures against NATO 
expansion will grow more insistent at that point, compounded by the fact that a 
skillful Russian challenge will be made to appear ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO expansion represents a balancing of two conflicting considerations: the 
fear of alienating Russia against the danger of creating a vacuum in Central 
Europe between Germany and Russia. A wise policy, instead of pretending that 
Russia has an option for NATO membership, would take two steps. It would 
proceed with membership for Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary 
and reject a Russian veto. But at the same time, it would propose a security 
treaty between the new NATO and Russia to make clear that the goal is 
cooperation. Such a treaty would provide that no foreign troops be stationed on 
the territory of new NATO members on the model on the arrangement for East 
Germany (or no closer than a fixed distance from the Poland's eastern border. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, such a treaty could provide for consultation between NATO 
and Russia on matters of common interest. In such a structure, there would be 
no reason for Russian security concerns. Going beyond it would grant Russia a 
right to create a vacuum around its borders, preserving the options of historic 
Russian expansionism. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to expand NATO in the near future is likely to prove irrevocable. 
Russian opposition is bound to grow as its economy gains strength; the nations 
of Central Europe may drift out of their association with Europe. The end 
result will be the very vacuum between Germany and Russia that tempted so many 
previous conflicts. When NATO recoils from defining the only limits that make 
strategic sense, it is opting for progressive irrelevance.

ZEDILLO CASTS HIS NET WIDE -- AND KEEPS THE OPPOSITION OFF BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

directs the North America Project of the World Policy Institute at The New 
School for Social Research.

<TEXT>
<P>
 By boldly acting to reform Mexican politics in his first two weeks in office, 
President Ernesto Zedillo is raising hopes in a nation accustomed to cynicism 
and is confounding an opposition primed for confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, his nomination of Antonio Lozano of the National Action Party 
(PAN) to be attorney general shocked stalwarts in the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI). Lozano will take charge of the corruption-tainted 
federal police, the war on drugs and the investigations into the assassinations 
of two prominent PRI politicians. The appointment sends a message that impunity 
in high places will no longer be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 This message carries a high political cost. Some of the more corrupt segments 
of the PRI, which supported Zedillo's candidacy, are feeling betrayed. Like 
former President Carlos Salinas de Gortrari, who courted the support of the 
more business-oriented PAN to neutralize PRI opponents of his economic reforms, 
Zedillo is inviting the collaboration of his foes to offset the loss of 
conservative support within his own party. The difference is that Zedillo is 
taking on the far greater challenge of political reform and -- not 
coincidentally -- casting his net far wider to include the left-of-center Party 
of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). So far, at least, the changes have been 
dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Salinas chose Enrique Alvarez del Castillo as his attorney 
general, who while governor of Jalisco was linked to the murder of U.S. 
drug-enforcement agent Enrique Camarena. The appointment reassured political 
elites that they need not fear prosecution for corruption. For secretary of 
government, the second most powerful post after the presidency, Salinas chose 
Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, best known for his role in the 1968 massacre of 
several hundred student protesters in Mexico City. That was a clear warning to 
the opposition not to protest too vigorously. When Gutierrez turned out to be 
more the conciliator, Salinas replaced him with Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, 
the governor of Chiapas who had gained notoriety by filling the jails with 
dissident Mayans, teachers and priests. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, there are no hard-liners among Zedillo's key appointments. 
Salinas turned to the army and police to deal with PRD protests; Zedillo 
invites PRD legislators to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chiapas, the spirit of collaboration has led to an unusual political 
appointment. Eduardo Robledo, the newly inaugurated governor whose election is 
disputed by the opposition, has chosen Eraclio Zepeda of the PRD to be his 
secretary of government. Zepeda, a longtime veteran of the Mexican left, has 
ties to the civilian wing of the Zapatista insurgency. Robledo could not have 
made such an appointment without the approval, perhaps encouragement, of 
Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 All this courtship is causing confusion and division within the PRD, which is 
more accustomed to repression. Part of its leadership, including a party 
founder, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, continues to see the PRI-dominated government as 
the agent of political murder and fixed elections. Thus, any overture from 
Mexico City must be resisted as a cynical attempt at manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 But another segment of the PRD leadership sees an opportunity for a political 
breakthrough. While still wary, it is eager to test the new government's 
intentions. Spearheading this group is the party president, Porfirio Munoz 
Ledo, a brilliant political strategist with one of Mexico's most striking 
resumes. While a member of the PRI, Munoz Ledo served as secretary of labor, 
secretary of education, ambassador to the United Nations and president of the 
PRI. He quit the PRI in 1987, after an ill-fated attempt to democratize the 
party from within. A year later, he was elected the first opposition senator in 
Mexican history and, in 1989, joined Cardenas in founding the PRD. As Cardenas' 
political star fades, the outcome of waning public support and personal 
inflexibility, Munoz Ledo is emerging as a major player on the Mexican 
political stage. Although he has not endorsed Zepeda's decision to take the No. 
2 job in Chiapas, neither has he condemned it. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's initiatives also threaten to soften public sympathy for 
Subcomandante Marcos and his Zapatista rebels. The rebels' central demand has 
been democracy and political reform. With no one seriously doubting that 
Zedillo won the election, they can no longer question the legitimacy of the 
federal government. Nor -- with Zedillo proposing an overhaul of the police and 
the judiciary and the replacement of all members of the supreme court -- can 
they argue that the president is not serious about reform. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves two outstanding issues. One is land reform, which may be addressed 
through the appointment of Arturo Warman, another old leftist, to replace PRI 
stalwart and millionaire businessman Carlos Hank as secretary of agriculture. 
The other is electoral reform in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some in Chiapas insist that the issues are for the state to resolve, 
they are inevitably a national concern. Clean elections at all levels of 
government are essential to the proper functioning of a federal system. 
Otherwise, the security of the entire federation is imperiled, as Chiapas is 
demonstrating. To ease tensions, and send an unmistakable message to other 
states and municipalities, Zedillo will need to ensure the replacement of 
Chiapas' discredited electoral system with a scrupulously fair one designed in 
collaboration with the president's new PRD luncheon guests.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; WILLIE BROWN; STILL IN CONTROL THOUGH JUST ANOTHER 
ASSEMBLYMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Cathleen Decker is a political reporter for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is at once the consummate insider and undeniable outsider, the man who has 
wielded unprecedented power in the halls of the Legislature as its 
longest-serving Speaker and, all the while, nursed the hurt that his political 
career will end there because, he says, California will not let an 
African-American man rise higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever people think of him, he is the most polarizing of California 
political figures, a representation of awfulness to Republicans and the symbol 
of liberal persistence to Democrats. Say his name -- everyone calls him 
"Willie" -- and the vision conjures before you: The man in the luxurious 
Italian suits, shoes that cost more than a month's rent, the flashy sports 
cars, the visible love life and wisecracking, acerbic, genteel, insulting, 
gracious, ever perplexing Willie L. Brown Jr., assemblyman from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in 14 years, that is all he is -- even though his staff 
continues to rankle Republicans by sending out press releases calling him 
"Speaker Brown." He is, actually, former Speaker Brown, the Assembly currently 
having a vacancy at the top. But even that has only added to the Brown legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, of course, counted him out, as so many have this former 
shoe-shine boy from Mineola, Tex. They had, after all, won 41 seats, a bare 
majority, in the Assembly last month, and with that came the speakership. Or so 
they thought. On judgment day earlier this month, all 39 Democrats cast their 
lot with Brown, and then -- with a dramatic slap on his desk -- so did 
Republican Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting 40-40 tie denied Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho 
Cucamonga the speakership. It prompted Horcher to cut his ties to the GOP -- he 
turned independent. It led his spurned colleagues to mount a recall against 
Horcher. And it left Brown where he so often has been in the last 14 years, 
smiling and figuratively, at least, in control. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he has offered a deal to Brulte, allowing Brown to be Speaker until 
July, when Brulte would assume control. But Republicans refuse to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, he was in Los Angeles, talking with reporters and editors from 
The Times about the serious business of government. But first there is small 
talk, of the kind that always arises around Brown. No, he is not going to 
Orange County, to see firsthand the financial crisis that has crippled that 
Republican outpost. No, he is not going to Sacramento, to do the state's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 No, after this coffee-and-conversation, he is going Christmas shopping. But 
not at any mall. The Republicans may have cast his coveted speakership into 
limbo, the voters might have turned their noses at the liberalism he has long 
espoused, but Willie L. Brown Jr. is not trimming his sails. He is headed for 
Armani, he says with a cackle. There, he hears, he might score a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How in the world did you do it?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It was pure, unadulterated luck. I had nothing to do with Mr. 
Horcher's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Horcher came to me in early November -- after the results became very 
clear -- and he said, "If you are a candidate for Speaker, I will support you." 
About six months ago, he wanted to change registration, and he came to see me, 
and I suggested to him that he probably could not get elected (in his 
Republican district). 
</P>
<P>
 But they (Republicans) were so nasty to him . . . . If they walked into a room 
of this nature, and the only seat available was next to Horcher -- nobody would 
sit in the chair. I could not assign any Republican to sit next to him on the 
floor. They just wanted to ostracize him; they wanted to destroy him. It really 
drove him batty. He was really angry. I've never seen anybody as angry. And his 
motivations were greater than any that could be generated by greed . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now, I had trouble with my membership. That required some skill, keeping all 
the membership in place while so many misrepresentations were being made. Each 
was told they were going to be dealt with harshly (by the Republicans). I had 
to keep saying it is not about winning the speakership -- it is really about 
the policy agenda . . . . You should not compromise yourself just for personal 
reasons. Fortunately, not one Democrat did. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where do you go now?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Mr. Brulte, he hasn't hit the wall. He still thinks he can win the 
speakership. Apparently, the month of promising the world that he was going to 
be Speaker raised the level of expectations among Republicans so much so that 
they are irrational . . . . They generally have built themselves into the Newt 
Gingrich mold. They really thought they were part of the national movement; 
they really thought their time had come. When it became apparent their time had 
not come, they became really angry. They are really, really angry. 
</P>
<P>
 I started Nov. 10, trying to talk to Brulte. I said the chances are of a 40-40 
tie. I knew of Horcher. But I said, even if it isn't 40-40, you can't run this 
place with only a one-vote majority. It's crazy to even try to run it . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I tried four more times in November to meet with him for that purpose. He 
would never sit down and meet with me. He would make the appointments, and then 
cancel them. Clearly, that was the intoxication of power. I've been there, so I 
know what guided him -- but I kept pushing and pushing and pushing. I assumed 
that when he hit the wall, and found out that it was only 40-40, there would be 
an opportunity. I was wrong, absolutely wrong . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: You seem to have set a July departure under this deal. Would that be the 
longest you would serve?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I may not serve that long. You have no clue what this job takes out of you. 
It's taking more out of me. I am competing against a party. I am no longer 
competing against a fellow leader. I'm really competing against a party, and 
it's not fun. It's not enjoyable . . . . Their political party has made me the 
hate object. If any one of them wanted to be rational and reasonable, they 
would run the risk of being a recall victim -- like Mr. Horcher . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Think of the arrogance of that. I'd be sent back to Texas in a locked box if I 
had even attempted to treat somebody that way, period. I may very well leave 
long before July, if by some means that will help the institution put itself 
together and be productive. At the moment, I don't think that it would. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I was wondering how you interpret the results of the election -- in 
California and nationally.  
</P>
<P>
 A: It says that the Democrats do not know their constituency. I couldn't tell 
you anymore who the real Democratic constituency is . . . . Republicans have 
continued to reach their base, narrow ideological constituency, that 
anti-government constituency -- and they do that very well. They know how to 
reach inside our operation with things like (Proposition) 187 -- which divided 
some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Philosophically, why not say, maybe it is the Republicans' turn? Maybe it 
is time for the Democrats to step out of power and let the Republicans go in?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I would never do that. I would never do that even if there were only one 
Democrat left. I care about things. I care about choice. I care about school 
funding. I care about freedoms that you enjoy. I don't want this place to 
become a fascist state, and I don't appreciate know-nothings doing the damage 
they can do. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I'm going to struggle even if there's only one of me. I'm going to 
struggle at every turn, at every philosophical turn -- no matter who is in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In Washington, a lot of people are talking about Pete Wilson as quite a 
strong potential Republican presidential nominee.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Wilson would be both a very strong Republican nominee and, I do believe, 
definitely a possible nominee. He's doing everything you're supposed to do to 
be the nominee . . . . Their agenda was not the governorship. Their agenda was 
the presidency. Wilson's positioning himself. It would not surprise me, even 
with (Democrat Gray Davis) in the position of lieutenant governor. They will 
sacrifice and let Gray have it if they need to. California will be the 
battleground . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The vote in November was seen, at minimum, as a plea from voters for 
smaller and less expensive government. In the weeks since, you have hired 
several friends and associates to high-paying state jobs. You have increased 
the pay of at least 40 staffers by 5%-10%. How is that in keeping with what 
voters want?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Brown asserts that his hiring authority is limited and he hires deserving 
candidates.) People write what I do in this regard and don't ever focus on what 
my counterpart, the governor, has done . . . . Willie Brown, the lightning rod. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Deserving or not, this is a state where unemployment is far higher than the 
national average, where the budget shortfall is expected to be at least $3 
billion by next spring. Doesn't that send a signal to voters -- if you're 
giving raises -- that you're not heeding the message they seemed to be 
screaming out?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Some people may interpret the voters' screams that way. I don't interpret 
the voters screams that way. I represent a district in San Francisco that voted 
"no" on 187, "no" on "three strikes," that voted for Kathleen Brown, that voted 
to reelect Willie Brown. I did not run in Orange County -- where they can't 
manage their own affairs and where they wasted more money, cumulatively, for a 
lifetime than my 10% raises would reflect. So I'm not burdened with what the 
people of West Covina voted for. Their representatives should reflect that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why are you a lightning rod?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think, over the years, my conduct has contributed substantially. I am not 
an ordinary person by any stretch of the imagination. I work at not being 
ordinary. And, in that process, sometimes rub people the wrong way. You offend 
people. You become a character. Fortunately, I may be a character but I'm not 
considered a stupid character. Maybe an extravagant character -- but not a 
stupid character. In the process, the myth begins to build and people add on to 
that myth . . . . If you just keep on acting the way you act, it begins to be 
magnified . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When you think in terms of Democrats in the state, who do you want to attack 
-- Leo McCarthy? Gray Davis? I am a statewide entity without ever being on the 
ballot, officially, statewide. Dianne Feinstein -- (Mike) Huffington attacks 
her because of her friendship with Willie Brown. Everybody gets attacked 
because of their friendship with Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . My utterances sometimes add to that, too. I'm not always responsible. 
(He laughs.) I'm not always responsible, certainly, in my comments. I sometimes 
say things just for effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will the Orange County financial situation play out and what role will 
Sacramento play?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We need to do a whole re-look. We also need to strengthen the hand of the 
treasurer. Clearly, no constituent investment fund in the state of California 
at the county level ought to be able to do that without some supervision by the 
treasurer's office of the state. After all, our directive to the treasurer is, 
"Above all else, protect the principal." He didn't act that way. He (former 
Orange County Treasurer Robert L. Citron) did, "Above all else, make money." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we need to be available to provide some stop-gap loans where it is 
appropriate to keep gasoline in police cars and fire trucks, and classrooms 
open. We need to provide a loan quickly for that, if that is, in fact, an 
actual need . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And the Orange County legislators, all of whom are anti-government, all of 
whom have been fiscally against any bailouts, whether for quakes or otherwise, 
are going to be in an interesting position. Can you imagine how many candles 
they must be lighting -- hoping that crazy guys like (San Francisco 
Assemblyman) John Burton and Willie Brown don't retaliate for their failure to 
support the sales-tax increase on a temporary basis to take care of quake 
damage in San Francisco? . . . . They have consistently voted "no." I am 
looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: On a news program, you attributed racism for the hampering of your career.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. I said it's very easy for a guy in Chico to make me out as an evil 
person. There's a certain amount of racism in the system -- particularly in 
those isolated places where . . . there's no diversity. And when someone up 
there says Willie Brown is evil, just look at him, you automatically get Willie 
Horton or you automatically get somebody who's awful. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes it very difficult. It limits the constituency to which I can 
appeal. It limits the constituency that will give me a fair hearing. It limits 
the constituency that I may be able to persuade. It, in fact, comes from 
racism. That has severely limited my career. 
</P>
<P>
 I had to make the hard decision that the speakership was where I would spend 
my energy and my time and make my contribution. I could not even consider any 
other alternative that I might foresee as equal to my skills -- simply because 
of the level of racism that exists in this state. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would you have liked to become?  
</P>
<P>
 A: President. I'm serious. I would certainly like to go to the natural limit 
of my abilities. And I don't think that is rational and reasonable and 
possible, because 5%-10% of the voting population says, automatically, "no" -- 
and I suspect, over the years, I have added to that.

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; UNIVERSITIES HIDE SCOPE OF VIOLENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES THOMAS SNYDER, James Thomas Snyder, a political science major at UCLA, 
is wire editor of the Daily Bruin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sexual-harassment lawsuit filed against a UC San Francisco psychology 
professor last month epitomizes the popular perception of gender relations on 
campus. Sex, academics and power mingled until the woman publicly condemned her 
alleged harasser -- also her dissertation supervisor and former lover -- 
potentially destroying both their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment naturally evokes controversy on campuses, the frontiers of 
"political correctness" and sexual politics. Unfortunately, what is lost in the 
power-charged debates over offensive speech and "Oleanna"-like he-said, 
she-said recriminations is the true scope of gender crimes on U.S. campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, four sexual-harassment lawsuits settled in secret came to light when 
the Daily Bruin, the campus student newspaper, sued for and won their release 
under the California Public Records Act. The university edited out all names, 
but the seriousness of the alleged incidents -- repeated rapes and forced 
masturbation -- were evident. Nearly $1 million of public money was spent to 
settle the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 If UCLA is representative, college administrations may be covering up large 
settlements made to alleged victims of sexual harassment to avoid costly, 
high-profile lawsuits. The often violent nature of the crimes is obscured by 
confusing and contradictory university harassment policies that leave victims 
little recourse but to settle quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to hide the dark side of campus life goes hand-in-hand with sexual 
harassment, because of the fear and shame the victim and harasser share. 
Frequently, confidentiality must be assured if a resolution can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted that the Daily Bruin sued for access to documents detailing 
sexual-harassment claims settled for sums in excess of $100,000 during the past 
four years at UCLA. In other words, there may have been many such settlements 
involving less money at the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Private universities are not obliged to reveal anything they want kept secret. 
And in the case of public universities, which can be sued under public records 
statutes, the process of disclosing sexual harassment can be difficult. For 
example, the campus paper for Nassau Community College sued twice for documents 
detailing sexual harassment charges against a professor, but did not win enough 
documents to learn much. 
</P>
<P>
 No simple solution exists. Public knowledge of each and every case would be 
overwhelming and would probably cause more problems than it solves. But 
students and taxpayers have a right to know how their tuition money is spent, 
how victims and alleged harassers are treated, how the process works and 
whether the results are just. To this end, universities could make available -- 
in redacted form -- the case backgrounds and how they were settled. Light would 
then be shed on the subject, while protecting those involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Secrecy protects the innocent and the guilty. By preventing us from knowing 
the extent of the sexual harassment problem on campus, it also keeps us in the 
dark about how we should combat it.

CITY HALL LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Let There Be Song, Too," photo, Dec. 8: For the past three years Los 
Angeles City Hall has become a focal point for ushering in the holiday season 
with a display of lights that adorn the entire exterior of the historic 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe Los Angeles residents should be aware that these lights were 
purchased and are installed annually at no cost to the taxpayer.The lighting 
project is a gift to Project Restore for the city by the 6,000 members of the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 11, and the 400 
contractors represented by the L.A. County chapter of the National Electrical 
Contractors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 This effort is truly a breakthrough in labor-management relations. Whereas 
labor-management disputes typically receive widespread attention, it should 
also be recognized that in the unionized electrical construction industry, 
labor-management cooperation has historically been practiced with great 
success. The City Hall lighting is just one example of what cooperation between 
organized labor and management can achieve.

NEWT GINGRICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Within the article "Gingrich Backs Denial of Medicare to Wealthy" (Dec. 9), 
Rep. Newt Gingrich expressed regret for suggesting that a quarter of the White 
House staff had used drugs, and for having called President and Mrs. Clinton 
one-time members of the counterculture. He excused his lapses by saying, "I'm 
trying to learn a new job." 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, it is difficult to speak intelligibly when your foot is in your 
mouth, but I would think that common sense is a prerequisite for the Speaker of 
the House, not part of the on-the-job training.

 The Democratic whip, Rep. David E. Bonior (D-Mich.), is calling for an outside 
counsel to investigate Gingrich for a violation of ethics for teaching a class 
that professes a goal of training citizens "into a model for replacing the 
welfare state and reforming our government" (Dec. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 I realize, to a Democrat, these thoughts are subversive, but are they 
unethical?

NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Fleeing Public Schools: The SRB Factor," by Thomas F. Jones, Commentary, 
Dec. 11: 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that my own local school, Overland Avenue Elementary, is a 
superb public school, many parents in the neighborhood have opted for private 
schools. These parents shuttle their children across town to pricey private 
schools, past the excellent public school that exists within walking distance. 
Many of these parents, who proclaim that public education could never provide 
for their children, have never even set foot in their community school to meet 
the principal, teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Overland Avenue School is top notch, with an energetic principal, devoted 
teachers and an abundance of volunteers. Every year parents at the school raise 
tens of thousands of dollars for teachers' aides, enrichment programs, 
computers, library aides and more. Our students consistently score high on 
standard achievement tests. We enjoy a multicultural environment much like the 
city the private-school parents live in. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the problem here? Some neighborhood residents, perhaps swayed by 
all-too-frequent negative media coverage, assume that public schools don't 
measure up. These are often the same parents who complain about the lack of 
community in Los Angeles and flee to other schools or even cities to find a 
better answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is their local public school. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have tremendous power to enrich their local school. In my 
neighborhood, if every parent were to commit to Overland, they would save 
themselves thousands of dollars (better spent on college tuition) and countless 
hours of driving. Even more, they would further our school's educationally rich 
environment, and contribute to a community treasure which I proudly claim is 
second to none. Broader community involvement in school affairs might even undo 
our growing climate of crime, anonymity and intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the search for heroes in our society, come knock on the door of your local 
public school. You'll find heroes and heroines too numerous to count.

FREE TRADE AND CAPITALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations on your editorial "Free Trade Is Wonderful, but . . . " (Dec. 
13)! The mantra of free trade and unfettered capitalism needs to be questioned 
closely by the media. In unrelated articles you have been laying critical 
groundwork. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same edition, "Relief Elusive for Asia's Labor Pains" points out that 
Adidas workers are paid $1.39 per day to make those exorbitantly expensive 
sports shoes that athletes are paid millions to advertise. As that article 
noted, "Conditions in teeming factory towns such as Tangerang represent what 
labor activists describe as the reverse side of the coin in the debate about 
free trade." Despite those exploitative low wages, Americans still don't get 
cheap shoes! 
</P>
<P>
 Another article, "Pact Should Benefit Big Industries in State" (Dec. 12), 
noted some major winners and losers in California, with transportation and high 
technology major winners. However, the author commented that "industries that 
depend on low-cost, unskilled labor are in jeopardy, because there is no way 
they can compete with farms and factories staffed by impoverished Latin 
American workers." Or, we might add, with low-paid Indonesian or other workers 
-- yet large and growing numbers of Americans need jobs for which they have few 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another article, "The Alienated Poor Are Today's National Threat" 
(Commentary, Dec. 12), the author writes that "the greatest danger to our 
national security now lies in the growing economic marginalization of so many 
Americans." This marginalization has not occurred in a vacuum, however. We have 
been operating under a GATT agreement for years (the Uruguay round), so GATT is 
not a new concept but a revised agreement. It has problems, will create at 
least as many more problems as solutions and needs to be carefully weighed and 
monitored in public forums. Economics is amoral -- as your editorial concluded, 
"Life, after all, is not just about business."

 Re "The Alienated Poor Are Today's National Threat," by Hugh B. Price: 
</P>
<P>
 We are still trying, in America and Western Europe, to deal with the results 
of the Industrial Revolution. In 19th-Century England there were riots by 
working-class people when the invention of the spinning jenny and other 
mechanical devices, which increased productivity in the textile industry, put a 
whole class of artisans out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although increased productivity has also increased wealth for everyone, it has 
done so erratically and unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 As a society we are hampered in finding fair ways to share the wealth created 
by increased productivity by our religious traditions, principally Calvinism. 
Calvinism teaches that people are good or bad by nature, and that the good 
people are elected by God to have prosperous, happy lives, and that God 
predestines bad people to suffer. Moral superiority and prosperity go together. 
Calvinism makes it possible to ignore the poor with a good conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans do not understand or accept that society is a complex system 
that benefits some, punishes others and that it is the system that provides the 
context for success. Similarly, most Americans reject the idea that society has 
a responsibility toward all of its members as a consequence of a general 
agreement to support this system. Most successful Americans believe they did it 
all by themselves. However, no one can build a train until someone invents a 
steam engine, and you can't run a railroad until someone lays the tracks.

SUPER SCOOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dec. 8 performance in Malibu of the CL-215 Super Scooper was consistent 
with its observed past performance in 1977-80, in Los Angeles County. Under 
high Santa Ana wind conditions, the CL-215 cannot effectively and safely drop 
water or foam at the head of a wildfire, in mountainous terrain, employing 
their present techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief C. Michael Freeman is right in requesting another year to 
evaluate the Super Scooper, its capability, techniques and cost. The idea of 
working a lease agreement with Canada or other jurisdictions deserves 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1950s and early 1960s a similar arrangement was operational with 
fixed-wing fire aircraft based at Van Nuys. They flew here in the summer and 
fall and wintered in Australia, their fire season. Los Angeles County, the 
California Department of Forestry and the U.S. Forest Service jointly shared 
the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 I retired in 1991 from the L.A. County Fire Department, with 36 years service 
as a vegetation management officer, and was appointed to the Wildfire Safety 
Panel this year by Supervisor Ed Edelman.

PERSPECTIVE ON MIDDLE EAST PEACE; CHOICE: A SETTLEMENT OR SETTLEMENTS; ISRAEL 
HAS IGNORED ITS PROMISE NOT TO EXPAND THE SETTLEMENTS, AND THE UNITED STATES 
JUST LOOKS THE OTHER WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Declaration of Principles signed by Israel and the Palestinians in 
September, 1993, stipulated that the West Bank and Gaza Strip "constitute a 
single territorial unit, whose integrity will be preserved during the interim 
period." This was supposed to mean that Palestinian land in the occupied 
territories would not be confiscated and that existing Israeli settlements 
would not expand during the five-year negotiating process. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such promises, Israel in the past 15 months has expropriated or sealed 
off about 20,000 acres of land in the occupied territories, violating both 
international law and the spirit of peace. Much of this territory, according to 
the Jerusalem-based Land and Water Establishment (which monitors such 
activity), lies just over the so-called Green Line that formally separates 
Israel from the occupied territories. The purpose, says Meron Benvenisti, a 
former deputy mayor of Jerusalem and an expert on Israeli settlement policy, is 
to "obliterate" the legal border, which "from the government's standpoint . . . 
legitimizes the absorption of an additional 12% of the West Bank (into 
Israel)." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has also continued to build apartments in pre-existing settlements. 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin put a freeze on all new settlements, but not new 
construction in existing settlements. Development has gone ahead based on his 
government's extremely elastic interpretation of what constitutes "existing 
settlements." This fall, the housing ministry disclosed plans to construct 
about 1,000 apartments in the West Bank town of Alfe Menashe, which will double 
its population. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hamas terrorism, such activity sows fear and distrust among the 
participants in the peace process. "On what condition," asked one West Bank 
resident who recently watched Israeli bulldozers uproot olive trees on his 
just-confiscated farm, "can they come and take my land, on which I have worked 
for scores of years?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Olive trees are our main source of income and now they are taking it away 
from us," said another victim of expropriation. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in the Israeli government seems eager to identify such confiscations as 
a violation of the Declaration of Principles. Many mainstream Israeli leaders 
who vocally condemn Hamas terrorism simultaneously hold that Israel has the 
right to seize and eventually absorb Palestinian land. Deputy Defense Minister 
Mordechai Gur states candidly that Israel will create "territorial continuity" 
throughout much of the territories during the interim period, "an achievement 
that Israel will present to Palestinian negotiators as a geographic fact." 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin, a Labor Party dove, told me that one 
acceptable option for a "permanent solution" to the conflict with the 
Palestinians is the Allon Plan, the party's unofficial guide to settlement 
policy from 1967 to 1977, which envisioned the absorption of nearly 40% of the 
West Bank into Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has quietly winked approval of such plans. Recall 
that President Bush had arranged in 1992 to deduct from Israel's annual loan 
guarantees the amount that Israel spent on settlements, a policy President 
Clinton pledged to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Administration is withholding only $216 million in loan 
guarantees, even though it calculated that the Israelis spent $310.8 million on 
"non-security" settlement activity. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the 
House subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East, has aptly charged the 
Administration with "weakening further U.S. opposition to Israeli settlement 
activity" by "acquiescing to $95 million worth of non-security expenditures." 
When Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau denied that the decision 
had any impact on Israel's subsequent announcement that there would be no 
settlement freeze, Hamilton replied, "There's a connection in everybody else's 
mind in the world but yours." 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department now officially refers to Israeli settlements as a 
"complicating factor." No longer are they considered an "obstacle to peace" (as 
under the Bush and Reagan administrations) or "illegal" (as under Jimmy 
Carter). While some U.S. policy-makers excuse Israel's recent expansions as 
private rather than state construction, in reality the Israeli government is 
involved in both the financing and planning of this activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The softened rhetoric and massive aid from its most powerful ally send Israel 
a clear signal that it may continue to seize land regardless of the terms of 
the peace process. Israel's willingness to depart from these terms was 
exhibited again Dec. 4, as several Cabinet members hinted that Israeli troops 
will not be withdrawn from the West Bank, despite the requirements of the 
Declaration of Principles. The State Department immediately agreed that Israel 
should not be expected to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who claim that continued U.S. support for Israeli expansions makes 
Israel more secure, it is worth recalling what was said at the outset of the 
current peace process. "Settlements," said Rabin shortly after he shook hands 
with Yasser Arafat, "were not established from any security point of view. 
Their whole purpose was political, to make any solution impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 This is still the case: It's either land or peace -- a settlement or 
settlements -- for the Israelis. To this point, Israel's leaders, with much 
gentle but decisive U.S. backing, are still choosing wrongly.

 Fifty years ago, the first Japanese Americans were allowed back to the West 
Coast from a three-year incarceration in internment camps to reclaim their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas day, 1944, the Kazuo Hiyama family returned to their farm outside 
of Fresno.A local newspaper photographed their homecoming. The family was 
smiling, talking about how good it felt to be home at last. Especially since a 
hero lived next door. 
</P>
<P>
 C.K. Oliver was not only a good farmer, but also a good neighbor. He had taken 
care of the Hiyama farm during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1942 and 1945, Oliver and hundreds of others along the West Coast took 
care of property belonging to the exiled Japanese Americans. There is little 
documentation of their acts; usually it was a hasty agreement ending in a 
handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a lease -- I just sent the Hiyamas a check at the end of each 
year," Oliver explains. "Yeah, there was some backtalk, but what the heck, it 
was the decent thing to do. I was raised to treat others as I'd like to be 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, these "Jap lovers," as some called them, challenged a nation 
filled with ugly wartime emotions. In the end, their acts of kindness spoke the 
loudest, especially to one Japanese American family on that Christmas day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hiyama family did not simply come back to a farm. They returned to a place 
called home because of a good neighbor. "We were friends," says Oliver. "I 
tried to work their place just like it was mine."

NOT JUST A HOLLERER; DESPITE WHAT LIBERAL PUNDITS SAY, GINGRICH HAS MOVED FROM

<P>
 Faced with the rise of Newt Gingrich and the House GOP, liberal commentators 
have groped for a variety of explanations. The duller writers have trotted out 
lame cliches about negative campaigning and white male anger. The more 
imaginative have attributed the election results to some sinister, mystical 
power: A recent opinion piece on this page compared the ascendant GOP to 
Lestat, the murderous villain of "Interview With the Vampire." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of vampirism makes for a good sound bite, but it does not address the 
real question: How has Gingrich gone from brash bomb-throwing bad boy of C-SPAN 
to Speaker of the House? 
</P>
<P>
 The ironic answer is that his bomb-throwing was constructive. Gingrich tossed 
verbal grenades not to tear down the House, but to open it up. By the 1980s, 
the Democrats had buried deliberation and accountability beneath a mass of 
procedural gimmicks, and Gingrich sought to blast open the process so that 
Americans could see the differences between the parties. 
</P>
<P>
 His real target was the chamber's arrogant leaders -- but those leaders had 
been entrenched for so long that Democrats equated any criticism of their 
stewardship with an assault on the institution itself. Some in Washington must 
be surprised to see that the House still stands, even with Republicans in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have denounced Gingrich as an "authoritarian" who wants to drive 
dissonant voices from the GOP. On the contrary: The hallmark of Gingrich's 
leadership style has been an effort to broaden the party's base and reach out 
to its various factions. He has said that he practices conflict management, not 
conflict resolution: "You only resolve conflicts by kicking people out and that 
means you become a minority. So if you intend to be a majority, you have to be 
willing to live with a lot of conflict, because that is the nature of a 
majority." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Gingrich columnists have cited his description of the Clintons as 
"countercultural McGoverniks" as proof that he can never become a responsible 
leader. Nonsense. His remark was downright gentlemanly compared with the way 
recent House speakers treated Ronald Reagan. Tip O'Neill called him "evil" and 
Jim Wright said that the famous Berlin Wall speech "just makes me have utter 
contempt for Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Gingrich has already shown a sense of institutional 
responsibility; his cooperation on NAFTA and GATT was crucial to final passage. 
As evidenced by his intent to be "Speaker of the whole House," Gingrich can 
move from "wedgislating" to legislating. 
</P>
<P>
 As a minority, House Republicans were accused of a "rule or ruin" attitude. 
Now pundits ask whether they seek "reform or revenge." Incoming Majority Leader 
Dick Armey (R-Tex.) has responded with "Armey's axiom," namely, you can't get 
ahead while you're trying to get even. Politicians sometimes rise above their 
passions and interests to act on principle. The reform of the committee system, 
led by Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas), means that some senior Republicans must 
forgo committee chairmanships. The defunding of the legislative service 
organizations struck at the Republican Study Committee as well as other House 
groups. Though this organization had long supplied the GOP with important 
services, reformers wanted to cut all the caucuses as a way of ending taxpayer 
financing for special-interest lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Republicans may be too busy enacting their ideas to exact revenge -- 
although faced with Democrats such as California's Pete Stark, former chair of 
the health subcommittee, who could blame them for gaveling these toppled 
tyrants into silence? 
</P>
<P>
 Observers seemed unduly confused by Gingrich's posture toward the Clinton 
White House: "Cooperate, yes; compromise, no." The line is rather clear. As an 
institution, Congress mediates among competing interests and ideas. Responsible 
legislating may involve compromising divisible interests, but it does not 
require selling out one's principles. 
</P>
<P>
 And House Republicans have spelled out their principles: They want to limit 
and decentralize government in order to promote individual freedom and 
responsibility. Gingrich seeks to replace the "corrupt liberal welfare state" 
with a "conservative opportunity society." He intends to use the bully pulpit 
of the speakership to transform public discourse and to advance a governing 
philosophy.

 A Film Clip on Dec. 11 about "City Hall" incorrectly implied that Ken Lipper, 
who wrote the film's story, also wrote "Wall Street." In fact, Oliver Stone and 
Stanley Weiser wrote the screenplay for "Wall Street"; Lipper wrote the 
novelization of that film.

VALLEY BRIEFING: REEL MONEY; THE BIG PICTURE; THE VALLEY'S FILM INDUSTRY: PART 
TWO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no surprise that making movies is big business in Los Angeles--but what 
about the San Fernando Valley? Of the seven major movie studios in the Los 
Angeles area, two, Warner Brothers and Universal Sutdios, are located in the 
Valley. The area is home to hundreds of smaller production companies and scores 
of actors, execuives andcraftspeople. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there are numerous businesses based in the Valley that supply 
good and services to the entertainment indstry. All told, the entertainment 
industry employed more than 70,000 people in the city and spent more than $8 
billion in 1992, according to a report by the Alliance of Motion Pictures and 
Televison Producers. Almost $5 billion of that was spent in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative form of movie-making is also a factor: The Valley has the 
dubious distinction of being home to the billion-dollar pornographic film 
industry.

 Cooing "O.K. pumpkin" as she wields her pink razor, Kim Applebaum shaves a 
one-inch square on both sides of the white-thatched neck of Konager, a 75-pound 
male Belgian sheepdog. Konager remains calm even after some swabs with alcohol 
and a pair of syringe plunges.A few minutes later, the canine blood pool is two 
bags fuller. Konager hasn't budged. 
</P>
<P>
 It's another dog-day afternoon at San Diego's Canine Blood Bank, which 
supplies blood to more than 200 veterinarians. One of a handful of such 
ventures in California, it started in 1985 with four donors and now has four 
dozen volunteer dogs spilling two pints four times a year for their 
less-fortunate brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was Buck, a black shepherd who was playing fetch when she was impaled 
on a stick; that took five pints," says nurse Applebaum. "Or the dogs injured 
by coyote or snake attacks or car accidents. That doesn't even scratch medical 
conditions and elective surgery. We can't keep up with the demand; we need more 
donors." 
</P>
<P>
 The need for canine transfusions is on the rise partly because "people will go 
to greater lengths today to save their dog," says Paul Cervone, administrator 
of the Emergency Animal Hospital, one of the blood bank's financial backers. 
"Pets are our 1990s family. Plus we're doing more sophisticated surgery than 10 
years ago, from hip replacement to cataract surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Donor dogs must have A-negative blood (the only one of the 11 canine blood 
types that's universal), weigh 50 pounds or more, be 2 to 7 years old, in good 
health and calm. Very calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm opening up the jugular vein to take blood for five minutes," says 
Applebaum, "and I'm nose to nose with a dog, I want to know she's obedient and 
isn't going to bite." Nanette Wiser

PALM LATITUDES: THE WORD; MULTICULTURE, INK

<P>
 When it was founded in 1959, L.A.-based publisher Holloway House was churning 
out books on Hollywood, books like "Ladies on Call," a biography of a madam who 
entertained celebrities in the 1920s and '30s. Tinseltown tomes were the 
mainstay, but the company did turn out the occasional change-of-pace title. One 
was Louis Lomax's "To Kill a Black Man" in 1968. Company executives couldn't 
have known it then, but the biography of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X 
was the first step on the way toward a special niche in American publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the Lomax book came novels by African American writers Robert Beck, 
aka Iceburg Slim, and the late Donald Goines. Both "ghetto realist" novelists 
were unexpectedly successful--Holloway House published 16 of the Goines books, 
and, says executive editor Raymond Locke, "all of them are still in print. Many 
are used in universities' black studies and American studies departments." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's refashioned cultural identity was complete by 1976, when it 
acquired Mankind Publishing, a small press dedicated to works by and about 
Native Americans. Hollywood was out and people of color were in. Locke says 
Holloway House Group is the only national paperback publisher devoted 
exclusively to multicultural fare.  
</P>
<P>
 It has made a few stumbles along the way. The Melrose Avenue firm tested the 
Spanish-language market in the early 1980s, but pulled out because "we found 
that to be a very difficult market," says Locke, who has been with Holloway 
House since 1984. "If you write about Mexican culture you're not going to sell 
to Cuba. There's no common cultural bond." 
</P>
<P>
 The company publishes up to 30 books each year under three imprints. Holloway 
House Publishing issues black mainstream and romance novels, as well as 
histories and biographies about black Americans. Mankind's purview remains 
Native American books, such as Locke's own "The Book of the Navajo," whose 
sixth edition will be out next year. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the company's most successful imprint is Melrose Square, a line of 
biographies of African Americans aimed at young adults. "In the last five 
years, we have done about 45 of them. That tail," Locke jokes, "is beginning to 
wag the dog a little hard." Ellen Alperstein

PALM LATITUDES: MELTING POT; BUILDING GOOD WILL

<P>
 When Tijuana was ravaged by floods and hundreds of poor hillside residents 
lost their homes in mudslides early last year, the Red Cross and other relief 
agencies provided basic emergency supplies. But Judy Bishop of San Diego 
realized that people would soon need something more: They'd have to rebuild 
their homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Bishop organized a donation drive in San Diego that drew about 400 tons of 
lumber, drywall, flooring, carpeting and other materials in two days. It took 
27 tractor-trailers to haul it all down. 
</P>
<P>
 The tremendous response from homeowners, businesses and contractors, combined 
with the obvious need in Mexico, prompted an idea: "There might be a business 
here," reasoned Bishop, formerly a senior account executive in the electronics 
industry. With investment banker Ted Reiff, she launched Building Materials 
Distributors, a nonprofit operation that recycles building supplies for a 
clientele that comes almost exclusively from across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months--while Reiff still kept his day job--the two "borrowed trucks, 
employees and yards," Reiff says, as they collected material from businesses 
and contractors (who can get tax write-offs for their contributions). "We 
sprung out on our own last July," says Reiff, who is the company's president. 
"Now we have our own trucks, yard, people." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's 10 employees work on a one-acre site just a stone's throw from 
the border. Virtually anything used in any building of any kind--lumber, 
plumbing and electrical supplies, roofing tile, doors, windows, awnings, 
fencing, cabinets, mirrored closet doors, tools and more--is available, cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 A bank being remodeled donated oak trim, wood plank flooring and 5,700 square 
feet of commercial-grade carpet. "It's in excellent condition, and it's priced 
$500," says Reiff. "We sell items here for pennies on the dollar." Pesos and 
dollars are accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically 100%" of its customers are from Tijuana, he says. One is Alicia 
Coronel, who comes twice a week for supplies to build her concrete-block and 
wood "casita." She estimates that she's saved at least $1,000. Materials are 
"muy caro" in Mexico, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The company hasn't ignored its charitable roots, making monthly runs to 
Tijuana community centers and churches. "It's not as many as I would like 
because the doggone duties are so high," Reiff says. "Even though the items are 
donated, we still have to pay the duties." 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing revolved around Judy wanting to make a difference," he says. 
"Our mission is twofold: to preserve the landfill space and to offer affordable 
materials to low-income people. We're like the Goodwill of the building 
industry." Sharon Whitley

 Another reason not to become an actor: 
</P>
<P>
 When Lance Henriksen, perhaps best known as the android Bishop in "Aliens," 
was denied homeowners and liability insurance last year, he was stunned at the 
reason: The insurer discovered a Times story saying that he had hung out with 
bikers while preparing for one movie and yelled at a priest during another.  
</P>
<P>
 Pretty minor misdeeds, you might think, but insurance companies frequently 
reject actors.Sarah Legan with Vansa Insurance Services, which specializes in 
performers, says many firms won't insure celebrities because they're easy 
targets for lawsuits and, as Jack Nicholson's driving habits and Johnny Depp's 
hotel-room antics show, have a reputation for recklessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absurd," says Henriksen, who will next appear with Sharon Stone and Gene 
Hackman in "The Quick and the Dead." "This goes back to the old days, when 
actors weren't even allowed in a hotel." Greg Spring

FILM CLIPS / COUTURE ON CAMERA: WHEN SHOW BIZ TAKES ON FASHION BIZ, ONE SIZE

 "You ever been to a fashion show? It's a sort of pagan ritual, a ceremonial 
dance where the faithful sit around sipping tea and worshiping clothes. There's 
a sacrifice involved, too. $1,500 for a dress, so help me. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Gregory Peck, as a sportswriter married to a fashion designer in the 1957 
film "Designing Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the lights came up after a screening a few weeks ago of Robert Altman's 
latest film, "Ready to Wear," a journalist in the third row turned to the 
fashion editor sitting next to him and said, "Those clothes weren't real, were 
they?" He was referring to the tartan kilts and figure-distorting bustles that, 
in the film, are the provocative designs of Cort Romney (Richard E. Grant). 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, sure they are," the editor chirped. "That's all Vivienne Westwood." 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter couldn't believe his ears any more than he believed his eyes. 
What looked to him like fantasy costumes never intended to be worn were 
actually the clothes that those who attend the twice-yearly ready-to-wear 
collections in Paris, Milan and London -- "the faithful," as Gregory Peck 
called them in "Designing Woman" -- stand up and cheer about. What seemed to 
this guy to be visual jokes are the styles that fuel fashion, the uncompromised 
visions of one of the world's most respected designers. 
</P>
<P>
 This man, like Peck's character, must be forgiven. He is not a fashion person. 
He is not a member of what has been called "the cult of the initiated." But 
that makes him a lot more typical an audience for Altman's new film, which 
opens Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences who are not acquainted first hand with the world of high fashion are 
not likely to believe their eyes, either, as actors like Lauren Bacall and 
Tracey Ullman rub elbows with such real-life designers as Christian Lacroix, 
Gianfranco Ferre and Jean-Paul Gaultier. What's real (editors finding their 
hotel rooms full of flowers and gifts upon check-in) and what's fake are all 
mixed up for this big-screen fashion farce. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's usually what happens when it comes to putting the fashion industry 
on film. It is a case of one business of artifice trying to capture another 
business of artifice -- cosmetically concealed warts and all. Throughout the 
years, when Hollywood turns its cameras on the fashion industry, the pictures 
that emerge are glamorous to be sure. Like the fashion show sequence filmed in 
color and plugged into the black-and-white world of George Cukor's 1939 version 
of "The Women," fashion injects pizazz into a film. But film isn't always so 
kind to fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fashion business adores the movies unconditionally -- designers 
repeatedly find inspiration in the glamorous days of Hollywood's golden age -- 
it is often a one-sided love affair. The portrait the film world paints of the 
fashion business is usually not an altogether pretty one. 
</P>
<P>
 Models are beautiful but stupid. Designers are coddled, capricious creatures. 
Fashion editors are flighty fascists. Everyone in the business is superficial, 
self-obsessed and convinced that what they're doing is of Earth-shattering 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has been shown is that they're basically shallow and that they have no 
inner lives," says designer Isaac Mizrahi, who is the subject of a new fashion 
documentary called "Unzipped" by director Douglas Keeve. "Fashion is always 
treated like the naughty stepchild." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mahogany," for instance, the 1975 film about a would-be fashion designer 
(Diana Ross) who becomes a top model, "really said a lot of scary things about 
fashion," says Mizrahi. He isn't referring to the Kabuki-style costumes Ross 
designed for the film, either. In "Mahogany," like so many fashion films, the 
fashion players are emotionally bankrupt. As Ross' politically correct 
boyfriend (Billy Dee Williams) says, "Baby, I don't understand this whole trip 
. . . making clothes for rich people to look at in a magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 20 years later, "Ready to Wear" is not nearly as unsettling, biting its 
broad target, but with rubber teeth. Although Altman acknowledges that fashion 
often is portrayed as frivolous and superficial, he is surprised by how worried 
some members of the fashion press were before seeing the picture. "What is it I 
could say that would be so terrible?" he asks. Making a big deal about nothing 
is part and parcel of fashion on film and on television. On the British comedy 
series "Absolutely Fabulous," level-headed daughter Saffron (Julia Sawalha) 
says to her panic-attack-prone mother, Edina, the fashion publicist: "It's only 
a fashion show . . . all you've got to do is play a bit of music, turn on the 
lights, get some people who've thrown up everything they've ever eaten and send 
them down a catwalk. . . . " But to Edina (Jennifer Saunders), like the 
characters in "Ready to Wear" and other fashion features, fashion is life or 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Films fuel the notion that fashion is something foisted on the public, 
ridiculously expensive confections shoved down women's throats. In "Funny 
Face," Kay Thompson's deliciously dictatorial fashion editor Maggie Prescott 
says "I want the whole country pink!" and launches into a giant "Think Pink!" 
production number that pronounces there's "not the slightest excuse for plum or 
puce . . . or chartreuse." Two minutes later, when asked if she'll be wearing 
pink, she says "Me? I wouldn't be caught dead." In other words, it's a power 
play between fashion people and "real" people. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion people are cultured and refined, gorgeous, effortlessly thin but 
cadaverously cold. "Face it, we're a cold lot, artificial and totally lacking 
in sentiment," Thompson says in "Funny Face," when she learns that her 
photographer (Fred Astaire) has fallen for his new model (Audrey Hepburn). Love 
for anything but clothes or work is not acceptable.  
</P>
<P>
 Real people, on the other hand, are often rubes with hearts of gold who never 
quite feel comfortable in the rarefied air of the fashion world in which they 
inadvertently find themselves. In "The Fashion Show" episode of "I Love Lucy," 
for instance, Lucy and Ethel go dress shopping in a couture salon. More 
accustomed to Gimbel's basement, Ethel asks, "Where are the racks? What do you 
paw through?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even dressed in such finery as the Don Loper original Lucy covets so 
fervently, they would likely not be welcome in the clique. Fashion's 
exclusionary nature is always reinforced on film, offering a glimpse of glamour 
but never with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if I put on my new suit maybe I could join the club. I couldn't. I 
didn't speak the language," says unpolished sportswriter Gregory Peck in 
"Designing Woman." Used to a crowd of poker-playing he-men, he's put off by his 
new wife's (Lauren Bacall, who is also in "Ready to Wear") circle of friends. 
"It's a silly, ridiculous business," Bacall says. "It pays far too much money. 
You meet silly, ridiculous people . . . and I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the ridiculousness, though, the fashion world is a safe haven for the 
eccentric. The world of "Ready to Wear" -- chock full of bisexual designers, 
heterosexual transvestites and pregnant nude models -- is "a comfortable home 
for people who've been ostracized," Altman says. That has always been true of 
fashion in real life and in fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the funniest examples of this is the "Lily Munster, Girl Model" episode 
of "The Munsters." In it, a ghoulish Lily (Yvonne DeCarlo) shows up to a model 
"go-see" wearing her usual costume -- a dress spun of "black widow's web." 
Instead of frightening designer Lazlo Brastoff (Roger C. Carmel), Lily enchants 
him with her exotic beauty. "Tell the other girls to go home," Brastoff says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a film or a television program does not have to be about the fashion 
business to be a "fashion" show. Truly, "The Wizard of Oz" was all about a pair 
of shoes. "101 Dalmatians" was about a fur coat. Designer Isaac Mizrahi says 
that films like "Auntie Mame" with Rosalind Russell "say more about fashion 
than fashion-industry movies often do. They say more about what people look 
like at that moment." Certainly, this is true of "American Gigolo," which 
helped boost Giorgio Armani's cachet in America in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion practically becomes a character in some films. Jean-Paul Gaultier 
designed the clothes for Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and 
Her Lover," including a dress that changes color as the wife goes from room to 
room, and for Pedro Almodovar's "Kika," where the hostess of an exploitation TV 
news show wears a video camera in her hat and a light-up bra to illuminate her 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the strongest things to happen to fashion was Nolan Miller's 
'Dynasty.' Every woman around started looking like Joan Collins," adds Michaele 
Vollbracht, an artist and former fashion designer who played himself on a 
fashion episode of the 1980s series "Hart to Hart." 
</P>
<P>
 Vollbracht has not seen "Ready to Wear" yet -- Vollbracht lives in a small 
town in Florida now -- but he is disappointed when he hears that the fashion 
industry is not savaged by the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it had just annihilated it," Vollbracht says with a charmingly 
embittered flair. "But I don't think they could ever really get the treachery 
of Seventh Avenue on film. I don't know if the entertainment industry knows how 
lethal the fashion industry is. There's nothing stranger than the real life in 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 He's lived in the world of ready to wear. He knows.*

NOW, FOR A LITTLE HEDONISM; FROM HIS HOLOCAUST SAGA IN WHICH JEWISH MICE ARE 
EXTERMINATED BY NAZI CATS, TO THE NEW YORKER COVERS GUARANTEED TO OFFEND, TO A 
WILD PARTY THAT ENDS IN MURDER: ART SPIEGELMAN'S CARTOONS DON'T FOOL AROUND.

 When he was 15 years old, Art Spiegelman and a friend who also aspired to be a 
professional cartoonist decided to submit some of their drawings to the New 
Yorker. The two knew that the New Yorker was the top of the line in the realm 
of their ambition, and yet, as best they could tell, the cartoons in the 
magazine were so sophisticated they didn't make particular sense. "So we 
thought the idea was to draw a cartoon you couldn't get," Spiegelman recalls, 
"and we came up with all these non sequiturs." 
</P>
<P>
 None of their submissions was accepted, but 30 years later, as things worked 
out, Spiegelman has become one of the New Yorker's most sensational artists, in 
recent years drawing illustrations for covers that are meant not just to be 
plainly understood but also to reach up and tattoo your eyeballs with images 
once unimaginable in the magazine of old moneyed taste. 
</P>
<P>
 This plot-worthy reversal has transpired under the reign of Tina Brown, the 
much-discussed British editor in chief whose noisy overhaul of the New Yorker 
has been every bit as graphic as it has been literary. In case you hadn't 
noticed or are one of the New Yorker traditionalists who refuse to pick up the 
magazine these days, it now contains comic strips by Spiegelman, Edward Sorel 
and other artists who once toiled mainly in the pages of the nation's 
"underground" and alternative media. The truth is, they are -- many of them, 
anyway -- comic strips of a high order. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Spiegelman, they are drawn by someone whose remarkable books 
"Maus I: A Survivors Tale" and "Maus II" -- which trace his parents' harrowing 
experiences in the Holocaust concentration camps and for which he won a 
Pulitzer Prize in 1992 -- have probably done as much as anything to raise the 
general esteem of comics as art. 
</P>
<P>
 As emissary for the new New Yorker, illustrator of a just-published new book 
and lecturer on the history of comics, Spiegelman had reason to be in Los 
Angeles recently, and on the morning of the day he was to be the guest of honor 
at a party at Dennis Hopper's house, he could be found near the pool on the 
roof of the Bel Age Hotel on Sunset, where he was staying. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman was born in Stockholm in 1948 and raised in Brooklyn. He lived off 
and on in San Francisco from 1967 to 1975, "shuffling back and forth (to New 
York) during the psychedelic moment," he said, but he has never spent much time 
in Los Angeles. On this day, he was not dressed for swimming; in fact, he was 
not dressed for Los Angeles at all. He was wearing a heavy herringbone tweed 
jacket over a heavy black shirt and was without sunglasses. Under the bare 
shade of a table awning, he was talking about the New Yorker; the new book, 
"'The Wild Party"; the absence of a personal style in his work; "Maus, the 
Movie" ( not! ), and then finally "Schindler's List," which he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, there was an earlier incarnation of the New Yorker which is hard to 
remember because it became such a suburban, Connecticut, Gentile magazine," 
Spiegelman said. "But in its Ross days," he said, referring to founding editor 
Harold Ross, "it was a kind of live wire -- like Peter Arno's cartoons were 
pretty hot for their moment. Charles Addams was considered rather morbid. It 
wasn't all those cartoons about businessmen in suits talking to each other over 
martinis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman said that if anyone looked at a history of New Yorker covers, from 
the 1920s through the '80s, he would see how graphic design in this century has 
plummeted: 
</P>
<P>
 "The '20s covers were quite decorative and pretty; the '30s and '40s and even 
into the '50s the covers are great -- great, great pictures. They're not just 
well-constructed images, they're arresting, they have content to them. Then, 
it's a long, slow decline from the '50s through the '80s, where it's some of 
these less-is-more wispy lined images on a flowerpot on a windowsill, which 
smacks of good breeding and good taste but to my eyes isn't even a very 
exciting picture. At least graphically, I think Tina Brown's magazine has been 
a total clarion call." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown invited Spiegelman into the magazine not long after she succeeded Robert 
Gottlieb as editor in 1992. Spiegelman shortly made his presence felt with the 
now-famous political Valentine's Day cover, depicting a Hasidic Jewish man 
kissing a black woman -- a play on racial tensions in Brooklyn, particularly in 
the wake of the Crown Heights riots. The illustration upset members from both 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe I was just really lucky that Tina was from England and didn't 
understand the hornet's nest that was being stirred up with this thing 
exactly," the artist said. "She found it as benign as she ought to." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman himself was quite pleased with the public reaction: "It was a 
controversial image, and it was meant to be. It got people talking about stuff. 
I was very happy to see that printed images can still function that way. For 
the most part, the printed word and the still visual image have been sidelined 
in our culture. Where else is a magazine cover allowed to be not a photograph 
of a celebrity or at best an illustration that's in service to the words inside 
the magazine as opposed to a free-standing thought by an artist? 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't in any given issue of the New 
Yorker, but the fact that the New Yorker is out there taking chances makes it a 
very alive and lively place." 
</P>
<P>
 Many are the skeptics who at this juncture in the conversation would say that 
given Brown's otherwise conventional absorption with celebrities as reading and 
gazing matter, it can be only a matter of time before a Richard Avedon 
photograph of Jack Nicholson or Sharon Stone becomes the magazine's first photo 
cover in 70-whatever years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Spiegelman is likely at least to have something to say about it, 
since he is not only a contributing editor but is married to the magazine's art 
editor, Francoise Mouly. The two founded the "graphix" magazine Raw in the 
early '80s, which featured work of such artists as Drew Friedman, Gary Panter 
and Sue Coe, some of whom are now New Yorker contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "So a lot of my talking about and consulting on the New Yorker very naturally 
happens with Francoise as well as with Tina," Spiegelman said. "We talk about 
artists and features and topics that would be good and visual formats that 
would be exciting to try." 
</P>
<P>
 They thought up the idea, for example, of sending "Zippy the Pinhead" 
cartoonist Bill Griffith to Aspen to cover the winter vacation scene. For the 
recent fashion issue, Coe did a strip about sweatshops in the Manhattan garment 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Francoise and I both think the best visual magazine in the history of the 
Western World was a French cartoon magazine called A Plate of Butter, published 
from 1901 to 1918 or so," Spiegelman said. "It was an amazing magazine. It 
couldn't exist in the world after television, of course. But what it was, was 
artists, sometimes very substantial artists, were allowed to do whatever they 
wanted for 16 pages or 32 pages, to give visual reports from whatever political 
vantage point the artist was coming from. So from week to week the magazine 
would lurch from left to right, and the main thing that kept it together was 
really great graphics." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman argues that since computers have altered the journalistic integrity 
of photographs ("You take a photo of us sitting here and send it to the photo 
shop and we could be sitting on the moon after you've matted us into another 
background"), photographs are "just another graphic style" with no authority 
except a vestigial one. Which he believes is only good news for graphic 
artists, making room for them to work and compete as journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as prose can be written in the first person and be journalistic, I'd say 
that it's possible now for artists to be working in the first person and still 
be giving journalistic information that has the same authority. Ultimately it 
might have even greater authority because you know where it's coming from. That 
kind of thing is part of what's possible at the New Yorker now." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a coincidence "but a happy one," Spiegelman said, that the 1928 
narrative poem "The Wild Party" -- which he has chosen to illustrate and 
republish (Pantheon Books) -- was written by Joseph Moncure March, who was once 
managing editor of the New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman first came upon "The Wild Party" in a used bookstore in the 
underground comix year of 1971, when the notion that he would one day be on 
staff at the New Yorker and have won a Pulitzer Prize would have been the 
week's best hookah dream. In any case, he said the poem's energetic, 
"hard-boiled" sensibility grabbed him and didn't let go. Considered slightly 
pornographic at the time, "The Wild Party" is an alternately playful and 
cynical tour in rhymed couplets of a New York showgirl's tawdry romantic life 
and a party that ends in a murder. William Burroughs is said to have been 
influenced by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What hips, what shoulders, what a back she had! Her legs were built to drive 
men mad." Spiegelman recited from the poem, gripped anew by its spell and 
wanting to share it. He picked up the slender volume, beautifully designed (by 
him), and searched for another set of lines he wanted to read. He found them: 
"Some love is fire, some love is rust, but the fiercest, cleanest love is 
lust." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great stuff. It's a book that if you fall for it at all, it goes way 
deep. It's just an expression of that Lost Generation between the wars, of that 
kind of unsentimental world view that's now become our basic set of glasses, 
from MTV to 'Pulp Fiction' to 'Sesame Street.' That attitude is the late 20th 
Century's attitude, and this is the birth of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the scores of heavy black-and-white drawings he has done to illustrate the 
story of these lowlife vaudevillians, Spiegelman takes both a gently humorous 
and frankly sensual approach, matching the style of the piece itself. Where 
"Maus" was drawn with a rather schematic line, these figures have the look of 
old engravings or woodcuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insofar as I have a style," he said, "it's by default. What I try to do is 
use a surface that's appropriate for the occasion. The point isn't to subsume 
the project as an expression of my sensibility but to enter into the project as 
fully as possible and find out what sensibility comes out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was not at all sure that people could identify his New Yorker 
covers from their markings alone: "I think some people say, 'Oh, it's got real 
wise-guy content, it must be Spiegelman.' But I don't think they can tell from 
the way it first looks." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the one of children exiting a school bus and heading all toward 
their morning classrooms, armed with automatic weapons. Spiegelman? Yeah. But 
the cover that might have been a dead giveaway was one from last Christmas 
season that never ran. Spiegelman drew a guy dressed up like Santa Claus 
urinating against a wall, with the stain forming the shape of a Christmas tree. 
Behind the man was a poster that said, "Don't forget the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 The night before the morning he was sitting on the roof of the Bel Age 
reciting "The Wild Party," Spiegelman had delivered a lecture about "Comics as 
a Means of Self-Expression" at the Los Angeles Central Library downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the auditorium where he gave his talk, a posted notice read: "Please 
be advised Art Spiegelman will be smoking during the program and book signing." 
He made good on the threat and told his sold-out audience that the two "Maus" 
books, which took 13 years to complete, had been delayed a year and a half by 
his attempt to quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman also told those who came to the library, among other things, that 
"comics are time made visible as space," that comics are "the Yiddish of art," 
that comics can "sear their way into your brain," that he has no use for 
super-heroes in comics ("They smell of fascism to me") and that as the culture 
moves into a "post-literate moment," comics are rising in importance. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran through the basic events of his own coming of age as a cartoonist, 
crediting the anarchic Mad magazine for overturning the sanitized Disney World 
that comics had become during the 1950s. "I thought of Mad magazine as an 
addition to the Talmud," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist said that he does not favor painterly comics, preferring a 
"scratchboard style" that carries readers quickly through the story rather than 
slow them down to marvel at the virtuosity of the drawing. That would describe 
the style of "Maus," in which he made the decision to represent his parents and 
other Jews as mice and the Nazis as cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "So why did I use mice? It had something to do with Zyklon B," he said, 
referring to the pesticide used by the Nazis to gas the Jews at Auschwitz. 
"With the idea of exterminating vermin." 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Maus" was published in 1986, Spiegelman has been offered heaps of money 
by studios and producers who want to turn the story into a movie. He has 
steadfastly refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I don't like movies, or 'Movies, that's not literature' -- like 
comics is! It's not that at all. It has more to do with the fact that 'Maus' 
took 13 years to find a specific form, with a lot of false steps, to hit a 
correct emotional tone. And I don't think that can be done by any committee. 
There are just too many ways for this thing to become sentimental, let's say, 
or on the other hand too vulgar, depending on the way one missteps." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the closest he has come to taking a deal was suggesting to one 
producer that he might agree to sell the rights "if they will use real mice." 
He has not heard back on that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone at the library asked about "Schindler's List," last year's Oscar 
winner directed by Steven Spielberg, a film Spiegelman has criticized in the 
past. He replied that he "had some problems with it" and let it go at that. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the hotel talking to a reporter, he grew more expansive as his opinion 
of the movie seemed to connect with other things he was saying about aesthetic 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want to enter into a kind of sweepstakes competition over who 
gets to win in control of genocide," Spiegelman said. "Hands down, Hollywood 
wins every time. It's the dominant narrative mode of our culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are problems with the film. For one thing, it tries to have it both 
ways. It's a specific story based on something that happened. At the same time, 
it's trying to become the definitive statement of the Holocaust -- a film used 
in schools to teach what happened to our children. You can't have it both ways. 
If it's going to be the second, then this is the wrong story to tell, because 
you're talking about an anomaly. You're talking about a righteous Gentile of 
some kind. This makes people feel good, but this wasn't what the story was 
about. The story was about the collapse of civilization, not about its heroic 
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one kind of problem. There's also a problem with dramatic 
representation that comes with this territory. What does it mean to elicit 
dramatic pleasure -- and tears and tragedy can offer dramatic pleasure as well 
as comedy, and uplift and music -- from so much suffering? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a scene in the movie where they think there's going to be gas coming 
out of the showers and it turns out to be just water. That's played for every 
ounce of emotional manipulation that can be had. There's a very similar 
sequence in 'Maus,' because when my father was brought to Auschwitz to a place 
where he was going to go in the shower, and he had heard about the showers, it 
turned out to be a live shower. . . . It's two panels in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I think that 'Maus' achieves its effects with no emotional manipulation, 
and that was very important to me. Like, all the cards are on the table, and if 
you cry it's just because life is sad. The problem with 'Schindler's List' 
ultimately is that it falls back into being a movie. So it has messages that 
have more to do with movie messages than actuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was important to me in 'Maus' not to try to make the characters heroic, 
not to try to make Vladek heroic," he said, referring to the character based on 
his father. "To cast doubt every time a statement was made, to try to preserve 
the complexity, because it's in that complexity where something can be 
understood." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Spiegelman said some thing that tends to get your attention coming from 
a cartoonist. He said, "I ask that you not caricature my position on 
'Schindler's List.' Because I really don't want to go one on one with Steven 
Spielberg about this or become a spokesperson again. I think 'Maus' is its own 
response to the events that happened and can function for those who dig further 
for more information than what 'Schindler's List' is offering." 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, asked if he were going to draw anything about Los Angeles, he 
replied quizzically: "About my trip here? Not unless I do one strip I've been 
thinking about that has to do with being a smoker on a book tour. Even last 
night, the contortions that had to be arranged for this thing to happen at all, 
with a very hip fire marshal who was able to find a loophole." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman discovered that, when it wants to be, L.A. is still a can-do town.*

NOW, FOR A LITTLE HEDONISM; FROM HIS HOLOCAUST SAGA IN WHICH JEWISH MICE ARE 
EXTERMINATED BY NAZI CATS, TO THE NEW YORKER COVERS GUARANTEED TO OFFEND, TO A

 When he was 15 years old, Art Spiegelman and a friend who also aspired to be a 
professional cartoonist decided to submit some of their drawings to the New 
Yorker. The two knew that the New Yorker was the top of the line in the realm 
of their ambition, and yet, as best they could tell, the cartoons in the 
magazine were so sophisticated they didn't make particular sense. "So we 
thought the idea was to draw a cartoon you couldn't get," Spiegelman recalls, 
"and we came up with all these non sequiturs." 
</P>
<P>
 None of their submissions was accepted, but 30 years later, as things worked 
out, Spiegelman has become one of the New Yorker's most sensational artists, in 
recent years drawing illustrations for covers that are meant not just to be 
plainly understood but also to reach up and tattoo your eyeballs with images 
once unimaginable in the magazine of old moneyed taste. 
</P>
<P>
 This plot-worthy reversal has transpired under the reign of Tina Brown, the 
much-discussed British editor in chief whose noisy overhaul of the New Yorker 
has been every bit as graphic as it has been literary. In case you hadn't 
noticed or are one of the New Yorker traditionalists who refuse to pick up the 
magazine these days, it now contains comic strips by Spiegelman, Edward Sorel 
and other artists who once toiled mainly in the pages of the nation's 
"underground" and alternative media. The truth is, they are--many of them, 
anyway--comic strips of a high order. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Spiegelman, they are drawn by someone whose remarkable books 
"Maus I: A Survivors Tale" and "Maus II'--which trace his parents' harrowing 
experiences in the Holocaust concentration camps and for which he won a 
Pulitzer Prize in 1992--have probably done as much as anything to raise the 
general esteem of comics as art. 
</P>
<P>
 As emissary for the new New Yorker, illustrator of a just-published new book 
and lecturer on the history of comics, Spiegelman had reason to be in Los 
Angeles recently, and on the morning of the day he was to be the guest of honor 
at a party at Dennis Hopper's house, he could be found near the pool on the 
roof of the Bel Age Hotel on Sunset, where he was staying. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman was born in Stockholm in 1948 and raised in Brooklyn. He lived off 
and on in San Francisco from 1967 to 1975, "shuffling back and forth (to New 
York) during the psychedelic moment," he said, but he has never spent much time 
in Los Angeles. On this day, he was not dressed for swimming; in fact, he was 
not dressed for Los Angeles at all. He was wearing a heavy herringbone tweed 
jacket over a heavy black shirt and was without sunglasses. Under the bare 
shade of a table awning, he was talking about the New Yorker; the new book, 
"'The Wild Party'; the absence of a personal style in his work; "Maus, the 
Movie" ( not! ), and then finally "Schindler's List," which he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, there was an earlier incarnation of the New Yorker which is hard to 
remember because it became such a suburban, Connecticut, Gentile magazine," 
Spiegelman said. "But in its Ross days," he said, referring to founding editor 
Harold Ross, "it was a kind of live wire--like Peter Arno's cartoons were 
pretty hot for their moment. Charles Addams was considered rather morbid. It 
wasn't all those cartoons about businessmen in suits talking to each other over 
martinis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman said that if anyone looked at a history of New Yorker covers, from 
the 1920s through the '80s, he would see how graphic design in this century has 
plummeted: 
</P>
<P>
 "The '20s covers were quite decorative and pretty; the '30s and '40s and even 
into the '50s the covers are great--great, great pictures. They're not just 
well-constructed images, they're arresting, they have content to them. Then, 
it's a long, slow decline from the '50s through the '80s, where it's some of 
these less-is-more wispy lined images on a flowerpot on a windowsill, which 
smacks of good breeding and good taste but to my eyes isn't even a very 
exciting picture. At least graphically, I think Tina Brown's magazine has been 
a total clarion call." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown invited Spiegelman into the magazine not long after she succeeded Robert 
Gottlieb as editor in 1992. Spiegelman shortly made his presence felt with the 
now-famous political Valentine's Day cover, depicting a Hasidic Jewish man 
kissing a black woman--a play on racial tensions in Brooklyn, particularly in 
the wake of the Crown Heights riots. The illustration upset members from both 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe I was just really lucky that Tina was from England and didn't 
understand the hornet's nest that was being stirred up with this thing 
exactly," the artist said. "She found it as benign as she ought to." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman himself was quite pleased with the public reaction: "It was a 
controversial image, and it was meant to be. It got people talking about stuff. 
I was very happy to see that printed images can still function that way. For 
the most part, the printed word and the still visual image have been sidelined 
in our culture. Where else is a magazine cover allowed to be not a photograph 
of a celebrity or at best an illustration that's in service to the words inside 
the magazine as opposed to a free-standing thought by an artist? 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't in any given issue of the New 
Yorker, but the fact that the New Yorker is out there taking chances makes it a 
very alive and lively place." 
</P>
<P>
 Many are the skeptics who at this juncture in the conversation would say that 
given Brown's otherwise conventional absorption with celebrities as reading and 
gazing matter, it can be only a matter of time before a Richard Avedon 
photograph of Jack Nicholson or Sharon Stone becomes the magazine's first photo 
cover in 70-whatever years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Spiegelman is likely at least to have something to say about it, 
since he is not only a contributing editor but is married to the magazine's art 
editor, Francoise Mouly. The two founded the "graphix" magazine Raw in the 
early '80s, which featured work of such artists as Drew Friedman, Gary Panter 
and Sue Coe, some of whom are now New Yorker contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "So a lot of my talking about and consulting on the New Yorker very naturally 
happens with Francoise as well as with Tina," Spiegelman said. 'We talk about 
artists and features and topics that would be good and visual formats that 
would be exciting to try." 
</P>
<P>
 They thought up the idea, for example, of sending "Zippy the Pinhead" 
cartoonist Bill Griffith to Aspen to cover the winter vacation scene. For the 
recent fashion issue, Coe did a strip about sweatshops in the Manhattan garment 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Francoise and I both think the best visual magazine in the history of the 
Western World was a French cartoon magazine called A Plate of Butter, published 
from 1901 to 1918 or so," Spiegelman said. "It was an amazing magazine. It 
couldn't exist in the world after television, of course. But what it was, was 
artists, sometimes very substantial artists, were allowed to do whatever they 
wanted for 16 pages or 32 pages, to give visual reports from whatever political 
vantage point the artist was coming from. So from week to week the magazine 
would lurch from left to right, and the main thing that kept it together was 
really great graphics." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman argues that since computers have altered the journalistic integrity 
of photographs ('You take a photo of us sitting here and send it to the photo 
shop and we could be sitting on the moon after you've matted us into another 
background'), photographs are "just another graphic style" with no authority 
except a vestigial one. Which he believes is only good news for graphic 
artists, making room for them to work and compete as journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as prose can be written in the first person and be journalistic, I'd say 
that it's possible now for artists to be working in the first person and still 
be giving journalistic information that has the same authority. Ultimately it 
might have even greater authority because you know where it's coming from. That 
kind of thing is part of what's possible at the New Yorker now." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a coincidence "but a happy one," Spiegelman said, that the 1928 
narrative poem "The Wild Party'--which he has chosen to illustrate and 
republish (Pantheon Books)--was written by Joseph Moncure March, who was once 
managing editor of the New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman first came upon "The Wild Party" in a used bookstore in the 
underground comix year of 1971, when the notion that he would one day be on 
staff at the New Yorker and have won a Pulitzer Prize would have been the 
week's best hookah dream. In any case, he said the poem's energetic, 
'hard-boiled" sensibility grabbed him and didn't let go. Considered slightly 
pornographic at the time, "The Wild Party" is an alternately playful and 
cynical tour in rhymed couplets of a New York showgirl's tawdry romantic life 
and a party that ends in a murder. William Burroughs is said to have been 
influenced by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What hips, what shoulders, what a back she had! Her legs were built to drive 
men mad." Spiegelman recited from the poem, gripped anew by its spell and 
wanting to share it. He picked up the slender volume, beautifully designed (by 
him), and searched for another set of lines he wanted to read. He found them: 
"Some love is fire, some love is rust, but the fiercest, cleanest love is 
lust." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great stuff. It's a book that if you fall for it at all, it goes way 
deep. It's just an expression of that Lost Generation between the wars, of that 
kind of unsentimental world view that's now become our basic set of glasses, 
from MTV to 'Pulp Fiction' to 'Sesame Street.' That attitude is the late 20th 
Century's attitude, and this is the birth of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the scores of heavy black-and-white drawings he has done to illustrate the 
story of these lowlife vaudevillians, Spiegelman takes both a gently humorous 
and frankly sensual approach, matching the style of the piece itself. Where 
"Maus" was drawn with a rather schematic line, these figures have the look of 
old engravings or woodcuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insofar as I have a style," he said, "it's by default. What I try to do is 
use a surface that's appropriate for the occasion. The point isn't to subsume 
the project as an expression of my sensibility but to enter into the project as 
fully as possible and find out what sensibility comes out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was not at all sure that people could identify his New Yorker 
covers from their markings alone: "I think some people say, 'Oh, it's got real 
wise-guy content, it must be Spiegelman.' But I don't think they can tell from 
the way it first looks." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the one of children exiting a school bus and heading all toward 
their morning classrooms, armed with automatic weapons. Spiegelman? Yeah. But 
the cover that might have been a dead giveaway was one from last Christmas 
season that never ran. Spiegelman drew a guy dressed up like Santa Claus 
urinating against a wall, with the stain forming the shape of a Christmas tree. 
Behind the man was a poster that said, "Don't forget the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 The night before the morning he was sitting on the roof of the Bel Age 
reciting "The Wild Party," Spiegelman had delivered a lecture about 'Comics as 
a Means of Self-Expression" at the Los Angeles Central Library downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the auditorium where he gave his talk, a posted notice read: 'Please 
be advised Art Spiegelman will be smoking during the program and book signing." 
He made good on the threat and told his sold-out audience that the two "Maus" 
books, which took 13 years to complete, had been delayed a year and a half by 
his attempt to quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegelman also told those who came to the library, among other things, that 
"comics are time made visible as space," that comics are 'the Yiddish of art," 
that comics can "sear their way into your brain," that he has no use for 
super-heroes in comics ('They smell of fascism to me') and that as the culture 
moves into a "post-literate moment," comics are rising in importance. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran through the basic events of his own coming of age as a cartoonist, 
crediting the anarchic Mad magazine for overturning the sanitized Disney World 
that comics had become during the 1950s. "I thought of Mad magazine as an 
addition to the Talmud," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist said that he does not favor painterly comics, preferring a 
'scratchboard style" that carries readers quickly through the story rather than 
slow them down to marvel at the virtuosity of the drawing. That would describe 
the style of "Maus," in which he made the decision to represent his parents and 
other Jews as mice and the Nazis as cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "So why did I use mice? It had something to do with Zyklon B," he said, 
referring to the pesticide used by the Nazis to gas the Jews at Auschwitz. 
"With the idea of exterminating vermin." 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Maus" was published in 1986, Spiegelman has been offered heaps of money 
by studios and producers who want to turn the story into a movie. He has 
steadfastly refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I don't like movies, or 'Movies, that's not literature'--like 
comics is! It's not that at all. It has more to do with the fact that 'Maus' 
took 13 years to find a specific form, with a lot of false steps, to hit a 
correct emotional tone. And I don't think that can be done by any committee. 
There are just too many ways for this thing to become sentimental, let's say, 
or on the other hand too vulgar, depending on the way one missteps." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the closest he has come to taking a deal was suggesting to one 
producer that he might agree to sell the rights "if they will use real mice." 
He has not heard back on that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone at the library asked about "Schindler's List," last year's Oscar 
winner directed by Steven Spielberg, a film Spiegelman has criticized in the 
past. He replied that he "had some problems with it" and let it go at that. 
</P>

 "You ever been to a fashion show? It's a sort of pagan ritual, a ceremonial 
dance where the faithful sit around sipping tea and worshiping clothes. There's 
a sacrifice involved, too. $1,500 for a dress, so help me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 --Gregory Peck, as a sportswriter married to a fashion designer in the 1957 
film "Designing Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the lights came up after a screening a few weeks ago of Robert Altman's 
latest film, "Ready to Wear," a journalist in the third row turned to the 
fashion editor sitting next to him and said, "Those clothes weren't real, were 
they?" He was referring to the tartan kilts and figure-distorting bustles that, 
in the film, are the provocative designs of Cort Romney (Richard E. Grant). 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, sure they are," the editor chirped. "That's all Vivienne Westwood." 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter couldn't believe his ears any more than he believed his eyes. 
What looked to him like fantasy costumes never intended to be worn were 
actually the clothes that those who attend the twice-yearly ready-to-wear 
collections in Paris, Milan and London--'the faithful," as Gregory Peck called 
them in "Designing Woman'--stand up and cheer about. What seemed to this guy to 
be visual jokes are the styles that fuel fashion, the uncompromised visions of 
one of the world's most respected designers. 
</P>
<P>
 This man, like Peck's character, must be forgiven. He is not a fashion person. 
He is not a member of what has been called "the cult of the initiated." But 
that makes him a lot more typical an audience for Altman's new film, which 
opens Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences who are not acquainted first hand with the world of high fashion are 
not likely to believe their eyes, either, as actors like Lauren Bacall and 
Tracey Ullman rub elbows with such real-life designers as Christian Lacroix, 
Gianfranco Ferre and Jean-Paul Gaultier. What's real (editors finding their 
hotel rooms full of flowers and gifts upon check-in) and what's fake are all 
mixed up for this big-screen fashion farce. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's usually what happens when it comes to putting the fashion industry 
on film. It is a case of one business of artifice trying to capture another 
business of artifice--cosmetically concealed warts and all. Throughout the 
years, when Hollywood turns its cameras on the fashion industry, the pictures 
that emerge are glamorous to be sure. Like the fashion show sequence filmed in 
color and plugged into the black-and-white world of George Cukor's 1939 version 
of "The Women," fashion injects pizazz into a film. But film isn't always so 
kind to fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fashion business adores the movies unconditionally--designers 
repeatedly find inspiration in the glamorous days of Hollywood's golden age--it 
is often a one-sided love affair. The portrait the film world paints of the 
fashion business is usually not an altogether pretty one. 
</P>
<P>
 Models are beautiful but stupid. Designers are coddled, capricious creatures. 
Fashion editors are flighty fascists. Everyone in the business is superficial, 
self-obsessed and convinced that what they're doing is of Earth-shattering 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has been shown is that they're basically shallow and that they have no 
inner lives," says designer Isaac Mizrahi, who is the subject of a new fashion 
documentary called "Unzipped" by director Douglas Keeve. 'Fashion is always 
treated like the naughty stepchild." 
</P>

 "Mahogany," for instance, the 1975 film about a would-be fashion designer 
(Diana Ross) who becomes a top model, "really said a lot of scary things about 
fashion," says Mizrahi. He isn't referring to the Kabuki-style costumes Ross 
designed for the film, either. In "Mahogany," like so many fashion films, the 
fashion players are emotionally bankrupt. As Ross' politically correct 
boyfriend (Billy Dee Williams) says, "Baby, I don't understand this whole trip 
. . . making clothes for rich people to look at in a magazine."

 Almost 20 years later, "Ready to Wear" is not nearly as unsettling, biting its 
broad target, but with rubber teeth. Although Altman acknowledges that fashion 
often is portrayed as frivolous and superficial, he is surprised by how worried 
some members of the fashion press were before seeing the picture. "What is it I 
could say that would be so terrible?" he asks. Making a big deal about nothing 
is part and parcel of fashion on film and on television. On the British comedy 
series 'Absolutely Fabulous," level-headed daughter Saffron (Julia Sawalha) 
says to her panic-attack-prone mother, Edina, the fashion publicist: "It's only 
a fashion show . . . all you've got to do is play a bit of music, turn on the 
lights, get some people who've thrown up everything they've ever eaten and send 
them down a catwalk. . . . " But to Edina (Jennifer Saunders), like the 
characters in "Ready to Wear" and other fashion features, fashion is life or 
death.

 Films fuel the notion that fashion is something foisted on the public, 
ridiculously expensive confections shoved down women's throats. In "Funny 
Face," Kay Thompson's deliciously dictatorial fashion editor Maggie Prescott 
says "I want the whole country pink!" and launches into a giant 'Think Pink!" 
production number that pronounces there's "not the slightest excuse for plum or 
puce . . . or chartreuse." Two minutes later, when asked if she'll be wearing 
pink, she says "Me? I wouldn't be caught dead." In other words, it's a power 
play between fashion people and "real" people.

 Fashion people are cultured and refined, gorgeous, effortlessly thin but 
cadaverously cold. "Face it, we're a cold lot, artificial and totally lacking 
in sentiment," Thompson says in "Funny Face," when she learns that her 
photographer (Fred Astaire) has fallen for his new model (Audrey Hepburn). Love 
for anything but clothes or work is not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Real people, on the other hand, are often rubes with hearts of gold who never 
quite feel comfortable in the rarefied air of the fashion world in which they 
inadvertently find themselves. In "The Fashion Show" episode of "I Love Lucy," 
for instance, Lucy and Ethel go dress shopping in a couture salon. More 
accustomed to Gimbel's basement, Ethel asks, 'Where are the racks? What do you 
paw through?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even dressed in such finery as the Don Loper original Lucy covets so 
fervently, they would likely not be welcome in the clique. Fashion's 
exclusionary nature is always reinforced on film, offering a glimpse of glamour 
but never with open arms.

 "I figured if I put on my new suit maybe I could join the club. I couldn't. I 
didn't speak the language," says unpolished sportswriter Gregory Peck in 
"Designing Woman." Used to a crowd of poker-playing he-men, he's put off by his 
new wife's (Lauren Bacall, who is also in 'Ready to Wear') circle of friends. 
"It's a silly, ridiculous business," Bacall says. "It pays far too much money. 
You meet silly, ridiculous people . . . and I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the ridiculousness, though, the fashion world is a safe haven for the 
eccentric. The world of "Ready to Wear'--chock full of bisexual designers, 
heterosexual transvestites and pregnant nude models--is "a comfortable home for 
people who've been ostracized," Altman says. That has always been true of 
fashion in real life and in fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the funniest examples of this is the "Lily Munster, Girl Model" episode 
of "The Munsters." In it, a ghoulish Lily (Yvonne DeCarlo) shows up to a model 
"go-see" wearing her usual costume--a dress spun of "black widow's web." 
Instead of frightening designer Lazlo Brastoff (Roger C. Carmel), Lily enchants 
him with her exotic beauty. "Tell the other girls to go home," Brastoff says.

 Sometimes a film or a television program does not have to be about the fashion 
business to be a "fashion" show. Truly, "The Wizard of Oz" was all about a pair 
of shoes. "101 Dalmatians" was about a fur coat. Designer Isaac Mizrahi says 
that films like "Auntie Mame" with Rosalind Russell "say more about fashion 
than fashion-industry movies often do. They say more about what people look 
like at that moment." Certainly, this is true of "American Gigolo," which 
helped boost Giorgio Armani's cachet in America in 1980.

 Fashion practically becomes a character in some films. Jean-Paul Gaultier 
designed the clothes for Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and 
Her Lover," including a dress that changes color as the wife goes from room to 
room, and for Pedro Almodovar's "Kika," where the hostess of an exploitation TV 
news show wears a video camera in her hat and a light-up bra to illuminate her 
subjects.

 "One of the strongest things to happen to fashion was Nolan Miller's 
'Dynasty.' Every woman around started looking like Joan Collins," adds Michaele 
Vollbracht, an artist and former fashion designer who played himself on a 
fashion episode of the 1980s series "Hart to Hart." 
</P>
<P>
 Vollbracht has not seen "Ready to Wear" yet--Vollbracht lives in a small town 
in Florida now--but he is disappointed when he hears that the fashion industry 
is not savaged by the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it had just annihilated it," Vollbracht says with a charmingly 
embittered flair. "But I don't think they could ever really get the treachery 
of Seventh Avenue on film. I don't know if the entertainment industry knows how 
lethal the fashion industry is. There's nothing stranger than the real life in 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 He's lived in the world of ready to wear. He knows.
