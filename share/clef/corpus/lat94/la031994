ARAB NATIONS AGREE TO RESUME PEACE TALKS WITH ISRAEL; MIDEAST: U.N. SECURITY

TO THE TABLE. CHRISTOPHER SAYS PLO MAY SOON FOLLOW.

 Syria, Lebanon and Jordan agreed Friday to resume peace talks with Israel 
after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution condemning the massacre 
of Palestinians in a West Bank mosque. The U.N. action also let the Palestine 
Liberation Organization inch toward renewed negotiations with the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after the resolution was adopted, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher told a news conference here that "a senior-level meeting between 
Israel and the PLO will take place soon" and "it is the expectation that these 
discussions will lead to early resumption of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday's announcement reflected a seeming defeat for the Clinton 
Administration in its tug of war with the PLO over the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials had threatened to veto the measure unless PLO Chairman 
Yasser Arafat agreed to an immediate resumption of negotiations. But the PLO 
refused, insisting that it wanted the United Nations to condemn the massacre 
without conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO -- after making a highly publicized breakthrough in the Middle East 
peace process with Israel last fall -- broke off talks on Palestinian autonomy 
in Gaza and the West Bank city of Jericho after an Israeli settler gunned down 
about 30 praying Palestinians in the mosque of the Cave of the Partriarchs in 
Hebron on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador, abstained on 
two paragraphs in the resolution but joined the 14 other Security Council 
members in condemning the killings and calling on Israel to take measures "to 
guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian civilians throughout the 
occupied territory." 
</P>
<P>
 These measures, the resolution said, should include "a temporary international 
or foreign presence" -- a reference to the possible stationing of outside 
observers in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the resolution, Christopher announced, let Syria, Lebanon and 
Jordan agree to resume their bilateral negotiations with Israel in April. The 
three Arab countries had suspended the talks after the Hebron massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said these negotiations, the impending PLO-Israel contacts and the 
dispatch of a State Department team to consult with the parties in the Middle 
East "will move us toward putting the whole peace process back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials said the decision to resume the talks between 
Israel and Syria, Lebanon and Jordan was galvanized by a phone call Thursday in 
which President Clinton urged Syrian President Hafez Assad and the others to 
return to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad phoned Clinton after noon Friday, the officials said, and told him that 
King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of Lebanon had agreed to 
resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
 High-level telephone calls were a feature of the day. Christopher said that 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had called Arafat in Tunis, Tunisia, 
earlier in the day. In Jerusalem, Israeli officials said Rabin made the call to 
discuss resumption of peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Americans' insistence, the Security Council voted on each paragraph of 
its resolution separately. The procedure let Albright register her objection by 
abstaining on two paragraphs without vetoing or abstaining on the entire 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is precisely to serve and protect the peace process," she said, "that my 
government has -- with great reluctance -- made the difficult decision to allow 
this resolution to pass today, despite the existence of some language we find 
objectionable." 
</P>
<P>
 First, Albright said, "we simply do not support the description of territories 
occupied by Israel in the 1967 War as 'occupied Palestinian territory.' " She 
said "this language could be taken to indicate sovereignty," a matter that 
Israel and the PLO, in their Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 
Sept. 13, agreed would be taken up in later negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, she said she objected to the description of Jerusalem as an occupied 
territory of Israel since "Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issues to be 
addressed in the negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 "My government does not believe that it is helpful in the negotiations to 
include the kind of reference that is made to Jerusalem," she said. "It could 
prejudice or prejudge the outcome of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 She told the Security Council that the United States had decided that it would 
not veto the resolution because the offending language was in the preamble 
rather than in its key operating paragraphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those key paragraphs -- introduced by France, Britain, Spain, Russia and 
Djibouti: 
</P>
<P>
 * Strongly condemned "the massacre in Hebron and its aftermath." 
</P>
<P>
 * Called on Israel "to continue to take and implement measures, including . . 
. confiscation of arms, with the aim of preventing illegal acts of violence by 
Israeli settlers." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sought measures to guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian 
civilians throughout the occupied territory including . . . a temporary 
international or foreign presence." 
</P>
<P>
 * Recommended the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, a senior Israeli official said the 15-minute discussion between 
Rabin and Arafat was largely "one of negatives." The Israeli leader told Arafat 
that he could not meet the full PLO demands but "would only do what he could" 
-- and expected Arafat to recognize his own political needs within Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin outlined the measures -- including the banning of extremist Jewish 
groups and the detention without trial of their leaders -- that he had already 
taken to curb violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
against Palestinian residents, according to Israeli officials. Rabin pledged 
follow-up action next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for a meeting between Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres 
were discussed, according to Israeli officials, and the meeting could come 
early next week in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suitcases are not yet packed," Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid 
cautioned. "But there is a possibility, a strong one, that such a meeting will 
take place soon, and with it full negotiations would follow." 
</P>
<P>
 In his talk with Arafat, Rabin reportedly said Israel would not pull its 450 
settlers out of the West Bank town of Hebron but would take steps to gather 
them into one or two groups in the town or in the adjacent settlement of Kiryat 
Arba, reducing the friction with Palestinians and making it easier for Israeli 
forces to protect settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials said Rabin emphasized the need to implement the basic 
agreement between his government and the PLO on Palestinian self-government in 
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho District in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources also said Rabin told Arafat that the Israeli army is already 
moving large numbers of troops out of Gaza and regrouping those that remain 
around the Jewish settlements there. But he warned that the steps could be 
reversed if the negotiations stall. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, meanwhile, met with Faisal Husseini, the senior PLO leader in 
Jerusalem, to argue for resumption of the talks, despite strong sentiment 
against it in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel said it hoped the Security Council resolution would bring the rapid 
resumption of talks with the PLO on Palestinian self-government as well as 
peace negotiations with neighboring Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel believes the best way to promote peace and security between Israelis 
and Palestinians is by resuming and accelerating negotiations on the 
implementation of the (Declaration of Principles) on Gaza and Jericho," Israeli 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Uriel Palti said. "In regard to the Security Council 
resolution, Israel hopes it will pave the way for the resumption of these talks 
with the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
 Palti noted: "Israel was first to condemn the horrendous massacre in Hebron 
and will continue to take decisive actions against extremist and dangerous 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel will encourage any measures to restore stability in the territories as 
far as they are in conformity with the Declaration of Principles," Palti said, 
"and it will do its utmost to carry out its responsibility for the security of 
all Arabs and Israelis in the territories."

Words of Condemnation 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the text of the resolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council. It 
was sponsored by Djibouti, as coordinator of the council's nonaligned members, 
as well as Britain, France, Spain and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council, 
</P>
<P>
 Shocked by the appalling massacre committed against Palestinian worshipers in 
the Mosque of Ibrahim in Hebron, on 25 February, 1994, during the holy month of 
Ramadan, 
</P>
<P>
 Gravely concerned by the consequent Palestinian casualties in the occupied 
Palestinian territory as a result of the massacre, which underlines the need to 
provide protection and security for the Palestinian people, 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to overcome the adverse impact of the massacre on the peace process 
currently under way, 
</P>
<P>
 Noting with satisfaction the efforts undertaken to guarantee the smooth 
proceeding of the peace process and calling upon all concerned to continue 
their efforts to this end, 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the condemnation of this massacre by the entire international 
community, 
</P>
<P>
 Reaffirming its relevant resolutions, which affirmed the applicability of the 
Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August, 1949, to the territories occupied by 
Israel in June, 1967, including Jerusalem, and the Israeli responsibilities 
thereunder, 
</P>
<P>
 1. Strongly condemns the massacre in Hebron and its aftermath, which took the 
lives of more than 50 Palestinian civilians and injured several hundred others. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Calls upon Israel, the occupying power, to continue to take and implement 
measures, including, inter alia , confiscation of arms, with the aim of 
preventing illegal acts of violence by Israeli settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Calls for measures to be taken to guarantee the safety and protection of 
the Palestinian civilians throughout the occupied territory, including, inter 
alia , a temporary international or foreign presence, which was provided for in 
the Declaration of Principles, within the context of the ongoing peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Requests the co-sponsors of the peace process, the United States of America 
and the Russian Federation, to continue their efforts to invigorate the peace 
process and to undertake the necessary support for the implementation of the 
above-mentioned measures. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Reaffirms its support for the peace process currently under way, and calls 
for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles, signed by the 
Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on 13 September, 
1993, in Washington, D.C., without delay.

MUSLIMS, CROATS SIGN ACCORDS FOR NEW FEDERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Muslims and Croats signed agreements Friday creating a new federation 
of their long-warring parties and stirring hope for a comprehensive settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But their accords raised concern among American policy-makers here about the 
peacekeeping role U.S. troops may eventually have to play in shattered 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony here, hailed by President Clinton as a "moment of hope," leaders 
of the two groups formally agreed to a new constitution and signed a statement 
of principles linking their commonly held areas to Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 The pacts are designed to increase pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, who control 
70% of Bosnia and have shown little inclination to surrender land or make other 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even acknowledging the obstacles that remain, Clinton said the agreements 
"offer one of the first clear signals that parties to this conflict are willing 
to end the violence and begin a process of reconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
 And Russia's chief strategist on the Balkan conflict, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaly S. Churkin, predicted that Bosnian Serbs will soon agree to a 
countrywide political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the signs of momentum toward peace, senior Administration officials 
acknowledged their concern that the public and Congress do not support plans to 
send U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia if a three-way peace agreement is signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawmakers and analysts said they believe that the peacekeeping contingent 
-- pledged more than a year ago in hopes of advancing the cause of peace -- 
would be difficult to sell to the public and could threaten Clinton's domestic 
agenda should Americans be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 David Gergen, presidential counselor, said that -- if a settlement is worked 
out -- the Administration will need to launch a "major educational effort" to 
persuade a public that has not yet focused on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 And the White House faces an "uphill battle," he said, in persuading skittish 
members of Congress to support such a move. "That's going to be a tough one for 
us," Gergen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that the nation's support is essential for such a venture. 
"First you commit the troops, then you commit the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have estimated that as many as 25,000 U.S. troops 
could be part of a peacekeeping force. The troops would be sent only if the 
peace agreement was clearly workable and if there were a clear strategy for 
withdrawal, officials have said. The contingent would remain only for a limited 
period -- perhaps one to two years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's strategy for selling the plan has been coming into 
sharper focus. If a peace pact is signed, officials would argue that the accord 
has marked a clear diplomatic victory for the United States but that the 
victory -- and peace -- would evaporate, if U.S. troops were not sent. 
</P>
<P>
 French and British officials have said their countries' troops would not 
participate without U.S. involvement. And Bosnian Muslims have been explicit 
about their insistence on U.S. participation in any comprehensive settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think in the last analysis Congress would want responsibility for 
choosing war over peace," one senior Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the chances for a settlement seemed to brighten, prominent lawmakers from 
both parties urged the White House to move quickly and aggressively to make its 
case for such a force. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, said Clinton has no time to lose, considering that 
President George Bush needed four months to sell Operation Desert Shield. "Even 
then, it was a struggle," Lugar said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Administration needs to begin by spelling out intentions that have 
been muddied by some officials' insistence that the United States would never 
send ground troops to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really clear in my mind what the President intends to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, said that Clinton "carries the burden of persuasion with Congress -- 
no doubt about it." Clinton may seek a congressional resolution explicitly 
spelling out lawmakers' support, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if a vote were to occur now, "he'd probably lose," Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls on the public's willingness to send U.S. peacekeeping troops show a 
sharp split. But the results become far more negative when the wording raises a 
possibility that troops might be hurt. An NBC News survey from last October, 
for example, found only 23% of those polled favored sending a contingent, while 
67% opposed it when it was suggested that the ground troops "could be subject 
to hostile action." 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia, "there will be some risks," Hamilton declared. "You have renegade 
commanders here and there, and there will be people taking some potshots." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Schneiders, a Democratic pollster, said that winning support for a 
peacekeeping contingent would be difficult for Clinton. And if the units began 
to suffer casualties, the move could hurt Clinton and threaten his domestic 
agenda, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The public still expects Clinton to be the domestic affairs President for whom 
they thought they had voted, Schneiders said. "For him to get too wrapped up in 
foreign affairs would be bait-and-switch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls have already shown Clinton's vulnerability to such public concerns. Last 
October, after U.S. Army Rangers were killed in an attack in Mogadishu, 
Somalia, Clinton's approval rating tumbled 10 percentage points, Gallup 
Organization polls showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that sending ground troops to Bosnia would be more difficult 
than sending them to Somalia, where the mission originally was a limited 
famine-relief effort, or to Kuwait, where there was clearly Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia, where national interests are not directly threatened, "is really a 
case without precedent for us," said Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former U.S. foreign 
policy official now at the Brookings Institution think tank here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's hesitancy to risk troops anywhere in the inflamed 
atmosphere of the former Yugoslav federation was apparent Friday, as officials 
discussed the new Muslim-Croat agreements. As part of those agreements, U.S. 
officials promised rewards for the country, starting with the opening, perhaps 
within weeks, of a new embassy in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior Administration official said the United States also would give 
Croatia permission to open consulates in New York, Pittsburgh, Cleveland and 
Los Angeles.

S. AFRICA POLICE ARMED INKATHA, PANEL FINDS; INQUIRY: COMMISSION SAYS 3 TOP 
OFFICERS WERE BEHIND HIT SQUADS LINKED TO BLACK PARTY. DE KLERK DENIES 
INVOLVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three of this country's most senior police officials secretly funneled weapons 
to the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party and helped train black hit squads 
involved in political violence and terrorism, the country's most respected 
judicial commission announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosive allegations, after a six-week investigation by the independent 
Goldstone Commission, are the first public corroboration of frequent charges by 
Nelson Mandela and other critics that President Frederik W. de Klerk's 
government has used a covert "third force" to foment black-on-black bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 The long report said the clandestine activity -- which allegedly included 
organizing train massacres, training Inkatha guerrillas with rifles and hand 
grenades and distributing combat weapons smuggled from abroad -- took place 
from 1989 until "the very recent past." 
</P>
<P>
 The account said guns were provided to Inkatha guerrillas in the nation's two 
most violent areas, the impoverished East Rand townships outside Johannesburg 
and the rural Zulu strongholds of Natal province. 
</P>
<P>
 The report specifically named the country's No. 2 police official, Deputy 
Commissioner Lt. Gen. Basie Smit, as well as officers in charge of the central 
investigations and counterintelligence divisions. Police units in East Rand and 
Durban, in Natal, were also allegedly involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, president of the African National Congress, the country's largest 
political party, has repeatedly charged that the government's white-led 
security forces were secretly behind Inkatha, the Zulu nationalist party headed 
by Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, in a conspiracy to destabilize the 
country and prolong white minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloody massacres and tit-for-tat slayings between followers of Inkatha and the 
ANC, especially in Natal and the East Rand townships of Thokoza and Katlehong, 
have claimed more than 15,000 lives in the last four years. Mandela canceled 
parts of a planned, two-day campaign trip to Natal on Friday because of what 
aides called assassination threats. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Pretoria, De Klerk strongly denied personal 
involvement or responsibility in the scandal and denounced what the report 
called "a horrible network of criminal activity" by senior police and Inkatha 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an absolutely clear conscience," De Klerk said. He called the officers 
"individuals with their own agenda" who operated a "small cell" within the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk said Smit, who was in charge of all police administrative and staff 
services, and the two other police generals had been suspended pending further 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers have denied any involvement. Commission Chairman Judge Richard J. 
Goldstone, who attended the news conference, said the available evidence was 
insufficient to make arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began Feb. 13 after a veteran police officer, identified in 
the report only as Q, approached Goldstone through an unnamed foreign diplomat 
and said he was willing to testify in secret about "third force" activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the informant testimony, the report said a clandestine police unit 
called "Vlakplaas," apparently named for a farm from which it operated, had 
manufactured and distributed guns to Inkatha vigilantes in East Rand "for the 
purpose of orchestrating violence." Anti-ANC guerrillas in the area were 
trained to use rifles and hand grenades, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report alleged that shipments of guns were delivered to top Inkatha 
members, including Themba Khoza, the party's regional chairman for the 
Johannesburg area. 
</P>
<P>
 The police unit also used phony passports to smuggle more sophisticated 
weapons from former war zones in neighboring Namibia and Mozambique, the report 
said. The serial numbers were removed from the arms before they were 
distributed to Inkatha members, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstone said the police group was directly responsible for considerable 
mayhem and bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impression I have is that the scale is serious in terms of the number of 
people whose lives were lost," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Goldstone report did not implicate any senior De Klerk aides. But it 
contained an allegation that his Cabinet authorized an unusually high payout of 
$343,000 to the commander of the Vlakplaas unit when he was discharged from the 
police several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And Goldstone, a 55-year-old former appeals judge, sounded skeptical of 
official police denials of complicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The professed ignorance by senior members of the activities of Vlakplaas is 
difficult to understand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk said an international task force would be asked to investigate the 
evidence to avoid charges of political interference. The members were not 
named. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dare not allow this dark cloud to hang over the elections," De Klerk said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But the political bombshell, less than six weeks before the nation's first 
democratic elections, cast an ominous pall over De Klerk's attempts to woo 
voters with claims that the ruling National Party was a party of peace and 
stability, while the front-running ANC was a party of terror and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 More specifically, it undermined De Klerk's oft-repeated denials of any 
government involvement in the savage spiral of violence that has ravaged the 
country since he released Mandela from prison in 1990 and began dismantling 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also clearly discredits Buthelezi, the only major political leader 
to steadfastly boycott the April 26-28 elections and the move to constitutional 
democracy and black majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the hard-line Zulu nationalist warned of a war of liberation with 
"no parallel in Africa," if the balloting goes ahead as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela canceled a planned meeting in Ulundi on Friday with Buthelezi's 
nephew, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini, after the ANC cited "firm reports" of a 
planned assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The largely powerless king later appeared at a Zulu rally to proclaim the 
KwaZulu homeland and surrounding Natal a sovereign state and warned that his 
subjects would "defend it at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela did not appear at a subsequent meeting of church leaders in Durban and 
scrubbed an appearance scheduled for today at a large Zulu festival in KwaZulu. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi, who also is chief minister of KwaZulu, could not be reached for 
comment on the Goldstone charges late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the homeland police commissioner denied any involvement in a televised 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC in a statement denounced "the existence of a sinister conspiracy 
committed to the destabilization of the country and the subversion of the 
transition to democracy. It confirms the charge the ANC has made many times 
that there exists a 'third force' engaged in murder and other criminal 
activities in pursuit of anti-democratic aims." 
</P>
<P>
 South African security forces have a sordid history of dirty tricks and covert 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the apartheid era, they used assassins, mail bombs and terrorist squads 
against the ANC and other political foes. 
</P>
<P>
 A more recent scandal in 1991, dubbed Inkathagate, revealed that the 
government had secretly funneled money to Inkatha. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, officially named the Goldstone Commission of Inquiry Regarding 
the Prevention of Public Violence and Intimidation, was created in 1991 to 
examine the causes of the growing black violence. 
</P>
<P>
 With sweeping powers to raid and search, subpoena witnesses and compel 
testimony, the panel of lawyers and investigators has issued more than 30 
reports on everything from taxi wars and township massacres to right-wing 
violence and police abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, Goldstone revealed that a secret military intelligence unit 
had used a dirty-tricks squad to sabotage the ANC, forcing De Klerk to fire 16 
intelligence officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early report, Goldstone also criticized the ANC, blaming its rivalry 
with Inkatha for being the "primary trigger" for most township violence. 
</P>
<P>
 A commission report last November, however, reported that only 42% of the 
panel's recommendations had been carried out or were under way.

SUPERFUND WELL CLEANUP DRAINS MONEY, CONFIDENCE; POLLUTION: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY 
BUSINESSES FACE A HUGE BILL. SLOW PROGRESS RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT FEDERAL PROGRAM. 
</P>

<P>
 It has been 15 years since the first evidence of chemical contamination showed 
up in a San Gabriel Valley water well. It has been 10 years since the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency designated the valley's huge aquifer a national 
Superfund site. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, one quarter of the valley's public water wells have been shut down 
and at least $50 million has been spent investigating the problem. Hundreds of 
private firms have been tapped by the EPA to cleanse the aquifer, which 
supplies drinking water to more than 1 million people.  
</P>
<P>
 But except for a treatment plant providing water for a few hundred people, the 
cleanup effort has yet to begin. After a decade of federal intervention, the 
aquifer remains one of the most heavily contaminated potable ground water 
basins in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the EPA is talking about a final cleanup bill between $200 million and 
$800 million that will be handed directly to local businesses. The potential 
impact on the valley's economy, along with nagging doubts about the 
effectiveness of the proposed cleanup technology, is sapping what's left of 
public confidence in the EPA and the Superfund program. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 10 years of confusion, power struggles and bureaucratic inaction, the 
community in the San Gabriel Valley is no longer convinced that Superfund, 
under the direction of the EPA, is going to solve their problem," Rep. Esteban 
Torres (D-La Puente), wrote in a recent analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the San Gabriel Valley quagmire epitomizes the entire Superfund 
program. Nationwide, it has consumed $30 billion since its inception in 1980 
while managing to clean up fewer than 10% of the country's 2,000 toxic waste 
sites. The mounting frustration of business and environmental groups has 
sparked demands for overhauling the Superfund law and led to a recent set of 
restructuring proposals by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But in many ways, the San Gabriel Valley situation is in a class by itself.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the Superfund law is designed to make polluters foot the bill for the 
nation's most lethal accumulations of waste, it is not easy to say who created 
the toxic soup under the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The ingredients have been percolating for nearly half a century, fed by 
fertilizer when the valley was a farming community, by household septic tanks 
and by chemical waste from many of the 48,000 firms that set up shop after 
World War II. A variety of chemicals have turned up in the water; the most 
potent are volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which can break down into human 
carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of identifying the polluters is further complicated by the nature of 
the pollution, which is hidden from view and moving around beneath the 
170-square-mile valley. Contaminated water under a piece of property may have 
come from that site or may have drifted "downstream" from some other source. 
</P>
<P>
 Superfund critics argue that society caused the contamination and ought to pay 
for eliminating it through taxes or an increase in water rates. Under the law, 
however, the EPA must try to track the contamination back to its above-ground 
sources and bill the property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the EPA has compiled a list of about 400 businesses that may be asked 
to pay the final cleanup bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Targeted companies could be looking at costs ranging from a few hundred 
thousand dollars to more than a million. That does not include the $135 million 
that officials estimate must be spent to detect and remove chemical 
contaminants from the soil above the water table. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's dealings with local firms have been widely assailed. "It may be 
futile, excessively expensive and unfair" to try to tie the contamination to 
specific businesses, Torres wrote in his report on the issue last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a tendency to see the businesses as criminals," said Jim 
Goodrich, the director of the San Gabriel Valley Water Quality Authority, a 
public agency created four years ago to look for new solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the regulators seemed to forget that for a very long time there were 
no regulations on how to dispose of this stuff. It wasn't all that long ago you 
could buy one of the most notorious solvents around to clean your carburetor, 
and if you happened to spill some of it on the ground, you weren't breaking any 
laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the government's work, Wayne Praskins, the EPA's project manager for 
the San Gabriel Valley Superfund, argues that the agency is doing a good job of 
pinpointing responsible companies, although he concedes that not all of them 
will be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Praskins said the EPA is on the verge of releasing its first detailed ground 
water treatment plan. It will focus, he said, on two dozen to three dozen firms 
in the Baldwin Park area, which will be asked to pay as much as $90 million in 
cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel reasonably confident we have singled out the significant sources of 
contamination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Admitting that the project has been a long, often exasperating experience, 
Praskins said, "In hindsight, you probably could identify ways we could have 
done things faster," but he also blamed the delays on the recalcitrance of some 
businesses. He is not alone in that opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The immediate reaction of businessmen was to say, 'To hell with 'em', sue 
'em,' " said Richard Nichols, executive director of the Baldwin Hills Chamber 
of Commerce. "That didn't work. The EPA isn't fearful of that kind of thing, 
but it took a while for that realization to sink in." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's list of 400 companies represents only about 20% of all those 
scrutinized by government inspectors. But if the past is any guide, the 
Superfund's economic impact is likely to extend well beyond the 400, because 
any one of them can attempt to recover costs by implicating others. As more 
people are dragged into the Superfund morass and as more lawyers and 
consultants are hired, costs will go up and the cleanup will take longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the businesses targeted by the EPA are large corporations, such as 
Aerojet General, a world leader in rocket propulsion systems. It was in an 
Aerojet well in Azusa where the first ground water contamination was detected 
15 years ago. And it is in that neighborhood where wells continue to yield some 
of the highest levels of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 But the EPA list also includes small enterprises struggling to survive the 
recession, according to the San Gabriel Valley Economic Council. 
</P>
<P>
 One government survey recently found that 142 firms have already paid a total 
of $15 million to conduct soil tests or install monitoring wells required by 
the EPA or its local affiliate, the California Regional Water Quality Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these firms worry that their initial investment is just the beginning 
of a never-ending process of compliance. They fear that the specter of 
liability will hang over their property indefinitely once they have been put on 
the EPA's list of potentially responsible parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fears are not entirely groundless. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Leon Wilton, the owner of a small machine shop in South El Monte, was 
visited by a state water quality inspector looking for sources of 
contamination. The visit, on the EPA's behalf, marked the beginning of a 
costly, six-year compliance process that has yet to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilton, a high school dropout from Indiana, landed in Los Angeles in the 
mid-1950s after a tour of duty with the U.S. Army in Korea. After a dozen years 
on aerospace assembly lines, Wilton bought a dozen used machine drills and went 
into business for himself in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, he filled out a routine questionnaire indicating that he stored 
certain chemicals on his property used to lubricate his machines. The 
questionnaire triggered the inspection. The inspector, noting oily stains on 
Wilton's concrete loading area, recommended soil tests to determine if leaks 
contributed to contamination of the aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests detected chemical residue, but well below the levels at which soil 
cleanup is required by state and county laws. The tests revealed 0.02 parts per 
billion of tetrachloroethane, a minuscule amount of one of the volatile organic 
compounds contaminating the aquifer. Elsewhere in the valley's soil, the same 
contaminants have exceeded 1,000 p.p.b. The safe level for drinking water in 
California is 5 p.p.b. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests on Wilton's property also detected 193 p.p.b. of toluene, a 
petroleum derivative that also has turned up in the aquifer. Under Los Angeles 
County regulations, Wilton does not have to clean up the toluene in the ground 
unless it reaches 300 p.p.b. Toluene has been found in other parts of the 
valley at levels of 20,000 p.p.b.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Wilton was asked to perform another round of soil analyses in 
1992. Those tests showed no increase in contaminant levels. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Wilton's business, which depends heavily on aerospace customers, was 
caught in the industry's downward spiral. He said he had to cut his work force 
in half and cash in an insurance policy to make ends meet. His lawyer told the 
EPA he was on the verge of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that the government's demands had already cost him $70,000, Wilton 
asked the agency to release him from any further Superfund responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilton, who is in his 60s, says he wants to sell his business or borrow 
against it to pay his debts. But he shares the fears of other businessmen in 
the valley that the threat of Superfund liability will turn away prospective 
buyers or lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA, however, refused to take Wilton off its list of potentially liable 
firms. Instead, the agency asked him to perform yet another soil analysis. 
Officials said Wilton had not proved that the contamination showing up in 
nearby wells did not come from his property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem," said Wilton's lawyer, Melissa McKeith, "is there is no point at 
which the EPA is required to say, 'OK, your property is clean, you don't have 
to do any more work.' There are no standards. Nothing to shoot for. It's 
totally discretionary. You're clean when some EPA official says your clean."  
</P>
<P>
 Torres has also criticized the EPA for its unwillingness to go easy on minor 
players such as Wilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The EPA has the authority to take the small guys out of the deal and protect 
them from future liability," said Fran McPoland, Torres' staff expert on the 
San Gabriel Valley Superfund. "I've been working on this issue for six years, 
and EPA keeps saying they are just a few steps away from making what we refer 
to as de minimus settlements with these companies. But the fact is they haven't 
done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Praskins said the EPA has yet to set its own "clean site" criteria, but added 
that the agency is "evaluating whether we can come up with numbers that people 
can use" to gauge how much cleanup work they need to do. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Wilton's situation, Praskins acknowledged that test results from his 
property "did not indicate a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the agency refused to grant Wilton the sort of liability waiver he 
could take to the bank, EPA lawyer Mark Klaiman said it was because Wilton's 
request for indemnity was part of a collective appeal by a group of South El 
Monte businesses. Some of the others, Klaiman said, had significant amounts of 
contamination on their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Records of the regional board indicate, however, that Wilton was pursuing 
indemnity on his own behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilton's experience underscores the uncertainty continuing to plague the San 
Gabriel Valley Superfund program.  
</P>
<P>
 "The EPA hasn't been able to tell business how much work it will take and how 
much it will cost because they don't know. No one really knows," said one 
public official close to the project who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, with the EPA on the verge of releasing its first comprehensive plan 
for treating the aquifer, agency officials concede that the process will not 
get all of the contaminants out of the ground water. Known as pump and treat, 
the process draws water from the ground, aerates the pollutants and recycles 
the purified water back to the aquifer. But some of the contaminants tend to 
get left in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be hard to get out the last part of the contamination. Getting down to 
5 p.p.b. can be difficult," Praskins said, referring to the state's safe 
drinking water limit for the volatile organic compounds. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if the drinking water can't be made safe. Dozens of San Gabriel 
Valley water companies have been doing it successfully for years, cleaning the 
water as it flows through the wellhead and passing on the costs to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that process does not attack the problem at its source -- in the aquifer. 
And as long as the contaminants are down there, they can spread and mutate, 
ultimately threatening neighboring aquifers, EPA officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 As the EPA moves toward the first of seven planned cleanup phases in the San 
Gabriel Valley, officials elsewhere are scrambling to come up with a way of 
easing the cost burden on local firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres has proposed legislation to require the federal government to pick up 
20% of the cleanup costs. But his bill has not gained much momentum in Congress 
and business representatives maintain that their costs could still be 
astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
 Another approach, this one more appealing to businesses, would allow companies 
to recapture a significant portion of their costs through credits received from 
the sale of treated water. The complex arrangement would involve the 
cooperation of the numerous companies and agencies that market water in the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although businesses are making the biggest push for reform, they have gained 
allies as the recession has cut deeper into the local economy,  
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, the East Valley Organization, a federation of neighborhood 
groups with a populist edge, put the aquifer cleanup at the top of its agenda. 
The group even offered rewards to people who turned in polluters. Today, East 
Valley Organization officials say they are equally concerned about the state of 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The EPA can come in and say to a small business, 'We think you might be 
responsible. Drill here. Drill over there, at your expense,' " said 
organization representative John Korey. "A lot of our folks work for those 
businesses. A lot of those businesses are being driven batty. Some have moved 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to lose any more of them." The Poison Below 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley, fertilizer from old farms, chemicals used to unclog 
septic tanks and industrial solvents from many of the 48,000 firms that moved 
in after World War II are the for decades. VOC Ranges 
</P>
<P>
 Volatile organic compounds, or VOC's are a common byproduct of industry that 
can break ingredients of a toxic broth that has been contaminating the 
underground drinking water supply down into human carcinogens. Here is a look 
at the concentration of VOCs under surrounding areas.

 Fertilizer: Left over from when the San Gabriel Valley was a farming 
community, nitrates from fertilizer have leached into the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry: Chemical products used by an array of firms have shown up in high 
concentrations throughout most of the valley's aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Septic tanks: Toxic chemicals commonly used to open clogged septic tanks 
before the valley had a sewer system are found in the ground water.

Gabriel aquifer for drinking water.

 Superfund legislation: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation 
and Liability Act of 1980 set up a revolving fund to clean up several hundred 
of the worst abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites. Some sites have been 
treated, but implementation by the EPA has been criticized and available funds 
are not sufficient.

INS TO RANDOMLY CHECK QUAKE AID APPLICANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under congressional pressure to strongly enforce a ban on non-emergency 
earthquake benefits for illegal immigrants, the Clinton Administration is 
directing the Immigration and Naturalization Service to conduct random checks 
of recipients of longer-term aid, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the new policy, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will 
require those seeking to extend their housing assistance beyond 90 days to 
declare that they are in the country lawfully and show proof of identification, 
spokesman Phil Cogan said. Applicants will be told that the INS will follow up 
with spot reviews of individuals' assertions that they were here legally at the 
time of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exact procedure that the INS will follow hasn't been worked out but the 
declarations of the applicants will be audited," said Phil Cogan, a FEMA 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency initially proposed a policy that would 
have required those seeking longer-term aid to simply declare their residency 
status without providing documents. But FEMA was urged by some lawmakers to 
adopt stronger measures and the new policy was worked out by four key members 
of Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy will have no effect on any recipient of aid that covers a 
period of less than 90 days. It is uncertain whether the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development or the Small Business Administration, which are also 
distributing earthquake benefits, will adopt FEMA's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration advocates maintain that there is no evidence that significant 
numbers of undocumented residents are seeking such benefits and that simple 
declaration would be sufficient. The proposal to institute INS checks was 
immediately decried by one prominent immigration attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to send a strong, chilling message through the community that 
if you apply for benefits, you're going to be turned over to the INS on a 
random basis," said Charles H. Wheeler of the National Immigration Law Center 
in Los Angeles. "It's a rather sharp departure from protections that currently 
exist in federal law." 
</P>
<P>
 But another advocate, Cecelia Munoz, senior immigration policy analyst for the 
National Council of La Raza, took a wait-and-see attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot depends on what the procedures are and what's being audited," Munoz 
said. "Having the INS audit FEMA and the process that FEMA uses can be done in 
a way that will not scare the daylights out of people who are legitimately 
seeking services for which they are eligible. We will carefully monitor the 
implementation to make sure no discrimination results." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the $8.6-billion disaster spending bill, relief agencies were 
required to take reasonable steps to ensure that no undocumented residents 
receive assistance beyond 90 days after the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffeted by conflicting congressional pressures, the Administration has been 
grappling with the politically volatile task of implementing the prohibition 
during the five weeks since the measure was adopted. FEMA, the lead federal 
disaster agency, has been at the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who negotiated 
the reasonable steps provision, had told FEMA that relying solely on 
applicants' declarations would be insufficient.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is my belief that FEMA should not be relying solely on the honor system, 
nor should it base its procedure entirely on an empty warning against making 
false statements," Feinstein wrote to FEMA Director James Lee Witt on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without further safeguards (e.g., requiring presentation of documentation or 
implementing follow-up enforcement efforts), I believe that the proposed FEMA 
process will provide much too little deterrent to be effective." 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has provided temporary housing assistance of two months for displaced 
renters and three months for homeowners. But it can extend the aid for up to 18 
months to those who are unable to re-establish themselves on their own. The new 
policy of proof of identity and INS spot-checks will apply to anyone who 
applies for an extension. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, HUD is providing 18-month rental subsidies to low-income 
quake victims. The agency has been using the honor system in taking 
applications for its program. The application states that declaration of 
residency status is made under the penalty of perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 The FEMA policy was a compromise reached by Feinstein, Reid, and Reps. Julian 
C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) and Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). Dixon and 
Berman are considered immigrant advocates. Neither could be reached for comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 An immigration rights activist who is familiar with the deliberations said 
that the alternatives were less desirable and would have created the potential 
for widespread discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policy, applicants seeking to extend their temporary housing will be 
required to show a form of identification, which is intended to deter fraud. 
FEMA has defined this as a driver's license, student identification card, 
employer identification card, health insurance card or any acceptable document 
that confirms one's identify.  
</P>
<P>
 Making a false declaration about residency will be punishable by a fine or 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cogan said FEMA attorneys were finalizing the policy Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of implementing it as soon as it can be done in an 
orderly fashion," he said. "We've already been in touch with our people in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, HUD has changed its policy that required all members of a household 
to be legal citizens before granting long-term housing aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In a March 16 letter to the Los Angeles Housing Authority, a HUD official said 
that, contrary to earlier directives, all adult members of a household no 
longer have to certify that they are in the United States legally. Rather, 
wrote Madeline Hastings, director of HUD's Rental Housing Division, only the 
applicants for long-term housing "shall certify that they are United States 
citizens or otherwise lawfully in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings instructed all local public housing administrators to "take steps to 
identify any applicant (who) may have been denied assistance since Feb. 25 as a 
result of earlier communications and reconsider that applicant for assistance 
if the applicant for assistance certifies his/her lawful status." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known how many families were denied housing on this basis. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD's earlier decision to require all adult members of households to certify 
that they were legal residents had generated intense concern among immigration 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that HUD is under a preliminary injunction against disqualifying 
applicants from its housing programs when some members of a family are citizens 
and others are not. This arose from a 1986 class-action lawsuit that charged 
that such a policy violated the constitutional right to free association.

COLUMN ONE; BITTER END TO HAWAII'S 'SUGAR LIFE'; ONCE CANE WAS KING. BUT NOW 
MANY OF THE GREAT MILLS WILL CLOSE. THE EMPTY FIELDS WILL LEAVE ISLANDERS WITH 
EMPTY HEARTS AND HUNDREDS OF OLD-TIMERS WITHOUT JOBS. 
</P>

<P>
 The smell of molasses and a sense of gloom pervaded the cavernous Hamakua 
Sugar mill. The last cane to be grown on the plantation's 32 miles of coastline 
fields was being chopped, crushed, boiled and dried. 
</P>
<P>
 "It breaks my heart because I have an emotional attachment to this place," 
said plantation general manager Ernest Bouvet, 73, who redesigned the mill in 
1976. "When I do something, I give it my best. I did that here. I will miss the 
sugar life." 
</P>
<P>
 After 118 years, the Hamakua plantation is scheduled to shut down Sept. 30 -- 
the first in a wave of closures that will decimate the industry that helped 
build Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other plantations on the islands of Hawaii and Oahu will close in 1995. 
A fourth is seeking drastic wage cuts from workers to survive another harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 Only plantations on the islands of Maui and Kauai are expected to survive the 
shakeout and continue producing raw sugar into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 A victim of rising production costs, foreign competition and the use of corn 
sweeteners in soft drinks, Hawaii's sugar industry has limped along for years 
on state loans, fluctuating revenues and tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 With the plantations' demise finally at hand, Hawaiians are mourning the end 
of an era and fiercely debating the future of the vast sugar lands and the 
people who lived and worked on them for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and tourists will miss the rolling green plantations that some 
consider as much a part of life here as the ocean. True Hawaiians may also miss 
the grainy brown smoke and sickly sweet smell of new sugar wafting from the 
mills at harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond nostalgia, hundreds of workers -- many descended from the immigrants 
who first farmed the fields more than a century ago -- face a greater loss: 
Without sugar, they will have no jobs and no idea of what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing the plantation will close puts tears in my eyes," said retired 
plantation worker Santos (Pito) Begas, 72, sitting on the steps of the red 
wood-framed house that he has lived in for decades. His father came from Puerto 
Rico and was a foreman on the Hamakua plantation. "God willing, I can stay 
here," Begas said. "At my age, I have no place else to go." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future of the cane fields, "the problem we now face is a reflection 
of what kind of state we have become," said Kem Lowry, professor of urban and 
regional planning at the University of Hawaii. "We have been a tourism state 
for quite some time. But there is a nostalgia for a different period in our 
history that remains quite strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knew this change was coming. What took so long to prepare? Much of 
the plantation land is privately owned and there has been an ambivalence about 
the proper role of government." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want wall-to-wall city in Oahu, opening these lands up for development 
is fine," said James Silva, a soil scientist at the University of Hawaii. "But 
if you prefer nature and open green space, it would be a terrible loss." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the plantations on Hawaii and Oahu are expected to remain fallow 
for years as alternative land-use proposals are debated in state and county 
offices, landowner boardrooms and community gatherings, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One worry is that the untended acreage may introduce the danger of 
catastrophic fires as more than 60,000 acres of carefully manicured irrigated 
cane fields dry up and become prairies of guinea grass, ironwood trees and 
weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamakua, Hilo Coast Processing, Mauna Kea and Oahu Sugar companies are under 
pressure from state officials to plant new crops and tropical trees. These 
could keep the land green, reduce dependence on mainland produce and create 
jobs for an estimated 1,500 cane workers. State tax codes also encourage 
agricultural use by raising property values if land goes fallow. 
</P>
<P>
 But sugar growers on tourist-heavy Oahu, fearing that they may not be able to 
turn a profit on diversified crops or afford to pay higher taxes on fallow 
fields, are also entertaining plans for major subdivisions and resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 No one expects to see mega-resorts sprouting up soon on these fields or 
anywhere else on this recession-battered archipelago. Tourism is down for the 
third straight year, and a glut of resorts has left many of the largest hotels 
begging for customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, economists predict that most of the plantation land on Oahu will be 
developed with small and mid-sized resorts, golf courses, commercial centers 
and subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Amfac/JMB, which leases the 11,000 acres that comprise the Oahu Sugar 
plantation, has already turned 577 acres of fallow fields in central Oahu into 
a successful high-density subdivision of mostly affordable and mid-priced 
homes, a golf course and a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plantation land on Oahu will be developed inevitably over the next 
decade," said Leroy Laney, a senior economist at First Hawaiian Bank. "Also 
inevitable is that most of the farm workers who will be unemployed are 
middle-aged and older and will have a hard time finding other jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and agriculture officials warn of another socioeconomic 
problem: massive new subdivisions and resorts could saddle Oahu with expensive 
infrastructure projects and more overdevelopment that could alienate tourists 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, reclassifying the land for urban uses could help lower 
housing costs on the island, where the median price of a single-family home is 
$350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On Hawaii, which is isolated from the throngs that stream through Oahu, 
officials are racing to solve a more immediate problem: How to help 800 cane 
workers who reside in the old sugar towns that sprouted up around and depend 
upon the Hamakua and Hilo Processing mills. 
</P>
<P>
 To walk through these plantation workers' enclaves is to travel back in time 
50 years and more, when sugar was king. Board-and-corrugated tin cottages are 
surrounded by tidy, redolent gardens of hibiscus and birds of paradise, and 
tangerine, papaya and mango trees. Roosters reared for cock fighting crow all 
hours of the day. Clumps of freshly cut bananas ripen on doorsteps and car 
hoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Many here had parents and grandparents who came from Asia and Puerto Rico to 
seek their fortunes, such as they were, in the fields. They plowed, watered, 
cut and carried the stalks on their shoulders to mills owned mostly by persons 
of European descent. 
</P>
<P>
 The plantation owners created a lucrative empire that brought prosperity to 
Hawaii and, eventually, to the cane workers. Once indentured servants, they are 
now among the highest-paid farm workers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one problem plaguing state officials is how difficult it is to help 
the field workers rebuild their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some will move away in search of work, most likely low-paying service jobs 
tied to the $9.4-billion-a-year tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost none will enjoy up to $15-an-hour wages, including benefits, again. Nor 
will they find housing available for the $50-a-month rent they pay to live in 
the company-owned camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cane workers, some of them retired, are trying to win permission to 
remain in their modest cottages after the plantations close. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ralph Cordoban, 45, is worried that it "is going to be a disaster," 
whether the 21 families in his camp on the Hamakua plantation stay or go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the people living here can't speak English, so how can they find 
jobs?" asked Cordoban, a portly man of Hawaiian/Filipino descent who keeps 54 
fighting roosters tethered to hutches in his front yard. "The state is trying 
to help us get into diversified farming, but not everyone has the knowledge to 
farm." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Klemm, spokesman for the century-old Hawaiian Sugar Planters Assn., 
called proposals to turn the sugar lands over to subsistence farmers a 
"self-sufficiency myth," largely because investors are not likely to finance 
new crops for unproven markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they did, he said, family farms would account for only a small 
fraction of the land being freed by plantation closures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would only take a few thousand acres to grow all the crops needed to keep 
all Hawaii alive," Klemm said. "What's to become of all the rest of the 
available farmland?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That is exactly the question we are grappling with now," responded Gerald 
Hagino, chairman of the state Senate agriculture committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, these fields are not all in one type of land or climate; the 
closures on Hawaii present different problems than the ones on Oahu," Hagino 
said. "Another problem is that most of these lands are private, and we may not 
have much say in what becomes of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of the present conflict were planted more than 30 years ago when the 
islands' economy changed abruptly with the simultaneous advent of jet travel, 
rising land values, higher wages for unionized agriculture workers and 
competition from the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, sugar production on Oahu and Hawaii -- the state's leading economic 
activity for more than 100 years and the reason it became part of the United 
States -- is withering away. 
</P>
<P>
 A few growers, such as Alexander & Baldwin Inc., have invested heavily in 
technological advancements and cost-cutting programs that will enable 
plantations on Maui and Kauai to remain efficient and profitable for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, however, the highly mechanized industry now accounts for only about 
1% of Hawaii's employment. Sugar production has fallen from about 1 million 
tons in 1987 to about 675,000 tons a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in recent months has Gov. John Waihee created task forces to try to 
preserve the year-round agricultural industry and help sugar-town residents 
through the difficult adjustment period by retraining them for possible jobs in 
hotel and golf course operations. The success of such programs, however, is 
iffy at best because hotels and resorts are laying off workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, most of the once-mighty sugar producers are now "land banks" 
waiting to convert their property for higher economic urban uses, according to 
Ira Rhoter, co-chairman of Hawaii's Green Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, their intention is to keep limping along in agriculture for tax 
advantages and then develop tourist centers," Rhoter said. "I believe we should 
get a hold of some of this land right now and start diversified agriculture 
projects instead of moving toward mega-development." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, pressure to develop the choicest portions of these fields is 
accelerating. And second-hand stores are filling up with plantation memorabilia 
that is selling faster than local handicrafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the five-story Hamakua mill is up for sale as scrap metal. But Bouvet is 
hoping that "a Third World country, maybe Pakistan or Vietnam, will buy the 
whole thing and hire me to help set it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The plantation superintendent's home at Hamakua -- a 5,000-square-foot house 
surrounded by a botanical garden with a magnificent view of Maui -- has already 
changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old house has been lost to a developer," Bouvet said, "who wants to turn 
it into a bed-and-breakfast inn or a hotel catering to upper-end overseas 
travelers."

<P>
FROM LONG ISLAND, A LESSON IN LIFE WITHOUT AEROSPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dual tracks of the Long Island Railroad cut right through the middle of 
the Grumman Corp. campus here, running alongside the abandoned runway, empty 
airplane hangars and shuttered factory buildings of this once-proud aerospace 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't build aircraft here anymore; the Hellcats and F-14s and lunar 
landing modules of years past are only a fond memory. And although 8,000 people 
still work here, the train doesn't stop at the Grumman station anymore. Long 
Island, and the late 20th Century, have passed this kind of factory by. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Grumman Corp. is now at the center of a bidding battle between two 
other aerospace giants in the first defense-industry takeover fight since the 
Cold War ended. Martin Marietta and Northrop Corp. both believe that Grumman's 
expertise in defense electronics, computers and other areas is worth big money 
-- up to $2 billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
 But the economic and cultural underpinnings of the "aerospace lifestyle" -- 
the prototypical suburban existence so familiar to Southern Californians -- 
have long been eroding here on Long Island, and will soon be gone for good. 
Grumman's new owner may not shut the flagship plant altogether, but big layoffs 
are likely, and much work will probably be moved to cheaper locations. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the people involved, the changes are jolting, "the end of life as 
we know it," in the words of one Grumman engineer.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there is another side to this story that has a clear message for Southern 
California, where massive aerospace and defense layoffs have helped prolong a 
searing recession. Long Island has largely succeeded in weaning itself from the 
Pentagon's largess, replacing aerospace manufacturing jobs with service sector 
jobs in computers, medicine and other fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there is something logical about disassembling a huge fighter-jet 
manufacturing facility that sits in the middle of a prosperous, densely 
populated suburb just 30 miles east of Manhattan. A Grumman transformed into a 
specialized subsidiary employing thousands of computer engineers would be a far 
better fit in the evolving local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grumman was a large part of the life of Long Island, but the economic mix is 
changing and has to change," says Matthew Crosson, president of the Long Island 
Assn., a business and civic organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our principal selling point is a skilled and highly educated work force, 
competitive with any region in the country. . . . Historically, aerospace 
manufacturing has been quite a significant segment of the economy, but it's not 
so significant anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, is small comfort to thousands of Grumman workers who are 
wondering what the future holds. Already, they have weathered cutbacks and 
transfers that have shrunk the Bethpage work force from a peak of 20,000 in 
1987. Last month, the company said it would shutter its airplane assembly 
facility in nearby Calverton and move the remaining work to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 For hundreds of Grumman sub-contractors, the prospects are equally uncertain. 
Fairchild-Republic, Long Island's other big aerospace concern, all but 
collapsed in the late 1980s, leaving Grumman the only game in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas P. Smith, president of Aero Specialists Corp., a small parts maker in 
Deer Park, says his business is down 50% from 10 years ago. He fondly remembers 
the days of the lunar module, when "cost was no object" in the aerospace 
business. Now, though, "it's dog eat dog," Smith says, and the company's main 
customer is Sikorsky Aircraft, a helicopter builder in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 At a deli across the road from the Grumman plant, three middle-aged Grumman 
engineers -- easily identifiable in their plaid shirts and knit ties, pens 
neatly lined up in their pockets -- were clear-eyed about their prospects.  
</P>
<P>
 None knew if they would have jobs after the takeover; nor did they know what 
kind of severance or pension benefits Northrop or Martin Marietta might offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they shared a sense that their world of middle-class prosperity and 
patriotism was gone. "We're into aircraft," said a balding man in his 40s who, 
like his friends, refused to give his name. "We build aircraft. Top Gun -- Tom 
Cruise running around in the sky, that's us. Is the country going to keep that, 
or is it a thing of the past?" 
</P>
<P>
 There is an understandable nostalgia for the good old days, when Grumman was 
one of a handful of pioneering aviation companies that built an enormous 
industry and helped win wars hot and cold.  
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1930 by Navy aviator Leroy Grumman, the firm got its start building 
pontoons for seaplanes, and remained at the forefront of naval aviation for 
more than five decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its biggest achievements were the World War II Hellcat fighter, the F-14 
carrier-based fighter, the E-2 and A-6 surveillance planes and the C-2 cargo 
plane. Its finest hour may have been in July, 1969, when the Grumman-built 
lunar landing module touched down on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 But a slide began in the 1980s as the Navy stopped launching new aircraft 
programs and Grumman lost out in the bidding for some key contracts. As its 
older planes were phased out, the work force began to shrink. Diversification 
efforts mostly flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Long Island was changing from a serene collection of mostly 
white bedroom communities to a highly developed, expensive and ethnically 
diverse area. Many lament what they see as a deterioration in the quality of 
life here and the arrival of big-city problems, namely crime and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 And they worry, naturally, about their job prospects. "The new jobs pay less," 
one 35-year Grumman veteran says bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
 They certainly don't come with the kind of job security and the paternalistic 
environment that made Grumman one of the largest non-union defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there are plenty of signs that Grumman's problems will be less than a body 
blow for the Long Island economy as a whole. Despite a lingering regional 
recession, unemployment on Long Island stands at just 6.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Regional Planning Board, says 
manufacturing accounts for just 11.5% of Long Island's 1.05 million jobs, down 
from 18.3% in 1980. And contrary to popular belief, many of the new jobs pay 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting high-end, high-wage jobs in the service industries," Kamer 
says. "We don't think living standards will fall across the board" as a result 
of the decline in aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 These new jobs are coming from firms like Magna-Lab Inc., a start-up company 
that leases a Grumman building at the edge of the Bethpage facility. Magna-Lab 
is developing a new kind of small, low-cost magnetic resonance imaging machine 
that will allow doctors to perform MRI diagnostic procedures in their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Island was the birthplace of MRI technology and is an ideal place to find 
the skilled workers the company needs, chief financial officer Ken Riscica 
says. "MRI is the integration of three technologies: computer technology, radio 
frequency technology and magnet technology," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many engineers at Grumman and other aerospace firms are experts in radio 
technology, he notes, and the Brookhaven National Laboratory on eastern Long 
Island has tremendous expertise in magnets. Magna-Lab has about 20 employees, 
and plans to deliver its first products in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to see what's happening to Grumman," says John Haytaian, who quit 
his job as an assistant program manager at the aerospace company in 1981 and is 
now vice president of sales and marketing at Magna-Lab.  
</P>
<P>
 "Long Island has disadvantages -- the high cost of housing, the high cost of 
running a business. But you have an abundance of resources here in terms of 
people."

ROSE FIRM MAY FILE COMPLAINT AGAINST HUBBELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rose Law Firm has decided to file an ethics complaint against former 
Associate Atty. Gen. Webster Hubbell and some of the firm's partners are urging 
a review of the expense account and billing records of other current and former 
Rose lawyers, including First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, sources close to the 
firm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Partners at the firm voted earlier this week to file an ethics complaint 
against Hubbell, a former Rose partner, with the Arkansas Supreme Court's 
Committee on Professional Conduct, the sources said. That agency handles ethics 
complaints against attorneys licensed to practice in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell resigned March 14 as the No. 3 official in the Justice Department 
after it was revealed that the Rose firm was reviewing the billing and expense 
account records he kept while a partner at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 James Neal, executive director of the Committee on Professional Conduct in 
Little Rock, Ark., said ethics complaints are not public records, and he 
declined to say whether the Rose firm has filed one against Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some of the firm's partners are pressing for a review of client 
billings and expense account records kept by all current partners and by those 
who recently left the firm, including Hillary Clinton and Associate White House 
Counsel William Kennedy III. Both were partners at the Rose firm until 
President Clinton was elected. Kennedy was managing partner until he joined the 
White House staff. 
</P>
<P>
 While current Rose partners appear to have no knowledge of any questionable 
billing or expense account records for either Hillary Clinton or Kennedy, some 
of the firm's attorneys argued that questions raised about Hubbell's billing 
practices justify an examination of the rest of the professional staff's 
records, including those of the two former partners. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the internal Hubbell review, they said, the firm should make 
certain no other problems will be uncovered now that the firm is part of 
investigation by Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. However, others 
in the firm disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald M. Clark, the Rose firm's chief operating officer, denied that the firm 
is conducting a review of billing or expense account records for either Hillary 
Clinton or other past or current partners. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the firm also has no plans to review billings by the late 
Vincent Foster, the White House deputy counsel and former Rose partner who died 
of an apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is looking into allegations that the Clintons may have benefited 
improperly from their association with James B. McDougal, owner of the failed 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and a partner with the Clintons in a failed 
real estate investment known as Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also investigating the role played by Hillary Clinton and the Rose firm 
in representing Whitewater Development and Madison Guaranty. The probe also 
includes an examination into Foster's death. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Hubbell inquiry by the Rose firm had little directly to do with the 
Whitewater matter, growing questions about the controversy embroiled the White 
House and made it impossible for Hubbell to survive in his Administration post. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rose firm begins a review of Hillary Clinton's records, it would open 
one more avenue of inquiry into her background at a time when she seems 
increasingly vulnerable because of the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Caputo, a spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton, echoed Clark's denial that any 
Rose firm review of the First Lady is under way. Kennedy refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that some partners are urging the review is another sign of the 
growing bitterness within the Rose firm over the toll that the Whitewater 
matter and the Clinton Administration's political problems have inflicted on 
the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a split within the firm is further evidence of the worsening relations 
between some of those who resigned to join the Administration and those who 
stayed behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Rose partners, including Hillary Clinton, left Little Rock for Washington 
after the presidential election, heightening the firm's hopes for its future 
while raising questions among conservative critics about its political 
influence in the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than one year later, however, one of those partners, Foster, is 
dead, and another, Hubbell, has resigned under a cloud. Many within the Rose 
firm say they believe that the firm has paid too heavy a price for its 
connections to the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, some Rose partners have expressed anger over the way in which 
some Administration officials have leaked what the firm contends is misleading 
information about the Hubbell case. They said White House officials have 
exaggerated the size and scope of the Hubbell billing and expense account 
review by telling reporters that Hubbell left the Rose firm with as much as $1 
million in liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the Rose firm said the Hubbell matter involves no more than 
$100,000 in unverified expense account and client billings. The implication is 
that White House officials are also trying to distance themselves from Hubbell 
and his problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why people in the Administration are putting this information 
out. I don't know what they think they will get out of it; but they are in a 
risky business because the truth will come out," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, some partners said there is a search under way within the 
firm to determine who first leaked information about the internal review. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers have argued that dissidents within the Rose firm have been 
seeking to distance themselves from the Clintons because of the Whitewater 
controversy and that such concerns prompted the firm's investigation of 
Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet sources close to the firm said the review was prompted by a complaint from 
a client last year. The firm tried for months to quietly resolve its 
differences with Hubbell, the sources said, giving him ample time to turn over 
credit card receipts and other records to verify his billing and expense 
account reports. 
</P>
<P>
 He repeatedly put off the firm, telling his former colleagues that he had just 
moved and that his records were packed away in boxes, these sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, after a series of partnership meetings, there was broad consensus 
that the firm had to take action against Hubbell, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no choice," one said. "There was no group of dissidents. We all 
recognized that we had to take action." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, firm attorneys have conducted a thorough review of the Rose 
firm's document-shredding practices in the wake of grand jury testimony from at 
least two firm couriers that raised questions about whether the firm had 
shredded documents from Foster's files. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now 100% certain that none of the documents were from Foster's files 
or had anything to do with Whitewater or Madison Guaranty," said one source 
close to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Firm partners are now prepared to testify before Fiske's Whitewater grand jury 
that the documents in question were unrelated papers placed in a box once used 
by Foster and bearing his initials. 
</P>
<P>
 All Madison Guaranty and Whitewater Development documents have been turned 
over to Fiske or are about to be transferred, the sources said.

JURY ACQUITS SIMI PRIEST OF EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley priest was acquitted Friday of embezzling collection money from 
his former parish in Ventura, and a mistrial was declared after jurors 
deadlocked in his favor on a charge of stealing more than $50,000 from another 
parish. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdicts ended the six-week trial of Father David Dean Piroli, 37, whose 
defense was built on a claim that a senior pastor framed him by planting 
thousands of dollars in cash in his church car and his rooms at St. Peter 
Claver Church in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors who voted 9 to 3 to acquit Piroli on the Simi Valley charge said they 
did not necessarily believe that Piroli was set up by Father James McKeon, but 
they had too many questions about where the cash had come from. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah!" shouted defense attorney Richard Beada as he and Piroli walked smiling 
from the courtroom into the arms of parishioners who remained loyal to the 
priest throughout the sensational trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli and Beada said little because of a gag order imposed by Superior Court 
Judge Allan L. Steele that will stay in effect until attorneys meet again April 
8 to discuss retrying the priest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Piroli rolled his eyes, telling reporters: "You know I'm not sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace, who had failed to convince jurors that Piroli 
skimmed money from the collection plate to feed a cocaine habit and buy gifts 
for a young Mexican man, did not comment either. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli hugged his attorney and his mother, Helen Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very happy," Ferrari said. "I just can't believe that someone 
that's innocent would have to go through all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Archdiocese announced that it accepts the verdict acquitting 
Piroli of stealing money from Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy, but it regrets 
that the jury deadlocked on the alleged thefts from St. Peter Claver. 
</P>
<P>
 "This prolongs what has been a painful episode for the entire Catholic 
community," said a written statement issued by Father Gregory Coiro, an 
Archdiocesan spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "With complete confidence in the priests, parish staff and parishioners as 
they focus upon healing after having been so publicly wounded, the Archdiocese 
categorically rejects allegations the defense made against the character, good 
name and reputation of Father James McKeon," Coiro's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to comment on Piroli's charges, McKeon said Friday: "Father Gregory took 
care of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he thought justice was done, McKeon said: "No comment, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 David Patrick Callahan, an attorney for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles in the Piroli case, said no one but the jury thought the defense's 
theory of a conspiracy by McKeon "had a chance in hell of succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to catch a thief who has a background in auditing and who 
knows if you steal cash it's very hard to get caught," Callahan said. "My way 
of thinking was he had scoped out St. Peter Claver Church and figured this was 
an easy place to scam. And he did it apparently quite well -- $60,000 in cash 
is quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Deacon Richard Hamm of St. Peter Claver said that Piroli should be retried for 
stealing the church's money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel he's guilty," Hamm said. "It was all circumstantial, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking a vote, jurors plowed through their notes on every single 
witness and each piece of evidence, said Randy McDonald, a Newbury Park juror 
who voted to acquit the priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasonable doubt pushed them toward acquittal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said the case against Piroli might have been stronger if employees of 
St. Peter Claver had not moved the cash from Piroli's room to church offices 
and then to a parishioner's home after finding it -- and if they had not waited 
11 days to report the alleged theft to police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, it seemed like a lot of people had their hands in the till," 
said McDonald, a Southern California Edison lineman. "A lot of us feel the 
Catholic Church has to look at how it does business." 
</P>
<P>
 A female juror, who asked not to be identified, added: "It was hard to follow 
the money." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury forewoman agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the (prosecution) fell through was reasonable doubt," said the juror, a 
48-year-old graduate student, who also asked not to be named. "There were too 
many people that had access" to collection money. 
</P>
<P>
 The three jurors were convinced not by any single piece of evidence, but 
"based on putting the chain together, the pieces of evidence," said the 
forewoman, who declined to say how she voted. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the witnesses were telling the truth," including Piroli, she said. 
"That's what made it hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial ended with an unusual twist when the deadlocked jurors agreed to 
deliberate more, then backed out and said they would never be able to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli was arrested on May 29, 1992, when Los Angeles Police Department 
officers found him and a Mexican national named Israel Palacios sitting in a 
church car in Hollywood with $10,000 in small bills, trace amounts of cocaine 
and church collection envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days later, as parishioners allegedly found thousands more in cash in his 
bedroom and office, Piroli left the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest testified later that he was driving Palacios to Mexico to help him 
escape from cocaine addiction in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror McDonald said Piroli's testimony seemed "rehearsed." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's final vote Friday on the St. Peter Claver charge was the same as 
their first vote on Wednesday. And Judge Steele almost sent them back to 
deliberate further after they sent out three questions Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first asked whether the police testimony was circumstantial or direct 
evidence. The second asked whether jurors should consider it an "insinuation" 
that the police report said the money found in the car was stolen. And the 
third question asked whether reasonable doubt could hinge on a single piece of 
evidence supporting the defense's conspiracy theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Steele pronounced the first question unanswerable, said the second 
question was for the jury to answer, and told them to reread the jury 
instructions to answer their third question. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the forewoman said the jury was hopelessly deadlocked. Steele 
arranged to replace a juror who had to be excused and directed them to restart 
deliberations Monday. Several jurors groaned. 
</P>
<P>
 He excused the jury, but two minutes later they sent another note: The answers 
made no difference, it said, they remained hopelessly deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele then declared a mistrial. 
</P>

LATIN AMERICA; DID PERU ARMY ALTER CASE TO HIDE DRUG ROLE?; CRITICS SAY 
TRAFFICKER WAS TRIED IN SECRET ON TRUMPED-UP CHARGE TO CONCEAL HIS LINKS WITH 
CORRUPT MILITARY OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, known as Vaticano (Vatican), was the patriarch of 
Peruvian cocaine trafficking. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration helped 
Colombian authorities capture him in January and deport him to Peru. After a 
swift trial, Vaticano is serving a life sentence -- not for trafficking but for 
"treason against the fatherland." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the secret and summary military trial say charges against Vaticano 
-- that he collaborated with Maoist terrorists -- were trumped up to cover up 
his collaboration with corrupt military officers. The controversy has 
reinforced discouraging doubts about whether the international flow of cocaine 
can be stopped at its source if Peru, the biggest source of raw cocaine paste, 
lets such corruption go unpunished. But U.S. officials say there are grounds 
for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Vaticano conducted business in the Huallaga Valley of eastern Peru, 
operating landing strips for drug planes and putting together big shipments of 
crude cocaine paste, which was flown to Colombia for refining. Headquarters of 
his "firm" in recent years was Campanilla, a town on the main road skirting the 
eastern foothills of the Andes. His landing strip there was a widened section 
of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 An anti-guerrilla army battalion based in Punta Arenas, a five-minute march 
away, often posted detachments in Campanilla. Numerous sources have told of a 
business relationship between Vaticano's firm and the officers at Punta Arenas. 
"If this guy is sending out tons after tons of dope right under the nose of an 
army contingent, obviously someone is getting paid off," a U.S. law enforcement 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1992, Vaticano moved to Cali, Colombia, home of the notorious Cali 
cartel, now the biggest cocaine-smuggling network. Meanwhile, Vaticano's firm 
continued to operate in the Huallaga Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 DEA agents knew that Vaticano was in Cali, but they did not know where. In 
late December, an informant told them where, charging $50,000 for the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian authorities arrested Vaticano in January and deported him to Peru 
for trial in a civilian court on trafficking charges. But then the army charged 
him with treason against the fatherland under a 1992 anti-terrorist decree, 
accusing him of giving arms and military information to Maoist guerrillas of 
the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path). He was tried in a closed courtroom by an 
anonymous military judge, who convicted and sentenced him Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaticano, 40, is now imprisoned in the same navy base where Abimael Guzman, 
the head of the Sendero Luminoso, is serving a life sentence, also for treason 
against the fatherland. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the anti-terrorist decree, Vaticano is to be held incommunicado 
for the first year of his term, which presumably would prevent anyone from 
hearing what he might have to say about military links with drug traffickers. 
But since his capture, information has leaked out that implicates army officers 
in his trafficking business. 
</P>
<P>
 Evaristo Castillo, a cashiered army major who conducted a surprise raid on 
Campanilla in 1992, has said that an army platoon there was protecting drug 
traffickers and refused to cooperate in the raid. Castillo said his commander, 
Gen. Eduardo Bellido, berated him for raiding Campanilla. "I know a lady in 
Lima who is the contact between Bellido and practically all of the 
drug-trafficking people," Castillo has told Peruvian human rights workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Pena Cabrera, Vaticano's lawyer, said in an interview that military 
commanders apparently fear that Vaticano "could compromise certain military 
officials in high positions." Pena said that, in legal testimony, Vaticano 
"implicated a commander, majors, captains and lieutenants" stationed at the 
Punta Arenas army base at different times during two years. "They charged 
$3,000, $4,000, $5,000 per flight" of cocaine paste, Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Nicolas Hermoza, the army commander, has denied that any military 
officers collaborated with Vaticano. But Hermoza acknowledged that 32 members 
of the army have been expelled for involvement in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 While Vaticano's case has battered the army with a punishing storm of 
publicity, there are indications that the military is getting tougher on 
traffickers. In late February, an army and police task force aided by DEA 
agents made Peru's biggest drug seizure ever, grabbing about three tons of 
cocaine paste in a raid on a secluded airstrip in the Manu national park.

MARINES PIN BARS ON MAN THEY DISMISSED; CIVIL RIGHTS: AFTER A 5-YEAR LEGAL 
BATTLE OVER RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, BRUCE YAMASHITA IS COMMISSIONED A CAPTAIN IN 
THE CORPS RESERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce I. Yamashita finally was commissioned as a captain in the Marine Corps 
reserve Friday, five years after he was dismissed from the corps' officers 
candidate school in what has become a major civil rights case for 
Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamashita, 38, a third-generation American whose grandparents came to Hawaii a 
century ago, was subjected to racial taunts and epithets throughout a 10-week 
course in 1989, then kicked out two days before graduation on grounds that he 
had exhibited "leadership failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Now an attorney in Washington, Yamashita waged a five-year legal battle 
against the Marine Corps that ultimately resulted in a high-level apology, an 
overhaul in Marine Corps officer-training procedures and the offer of a 
commission, albeit in the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a green uniformed Yamashita -- sporting a Marine Corps-style crew 
cut and straining to hold back his emotions -- took his oath as an officer and 
beamed as his captain's bars were pinned on by retired Marine Maj. Ernest 
Kimoto, his co-counsel in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "For five years now, I have thought about this moment," Yamashita told a crowd 
of relatives and well-wishers in the flag-bedecked House Armed Services 
Committee hearing room on Capitol Hill. "It means much more to me now than ever 
I could have imagined five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioning, which lasted only a few minutes, had all the trappings of a 
celebration, as lawmakers and civil rights advocates -- many of them from 
Hawaii and wearing ceremonial leis made of maile vine to mark the occasion -- 
praised Yamashita for taking his stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "His commissioning today is a tribute to his dedication, a tribute to his 
courage," said Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose), a prominent 
Japanese-American lawmaker and one of several members of Congress who supported 
Yamashita when he was waging his fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuously absent were representatives of the Marine Corps. Aside from 
Yamashita and Marine Capt. Peter Keating, the Washington-area recruiting 
officer who administered the oath, the only green-uniformed attendee was a 
spokesman from the public affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the commissioning ceremony said that Yamashita had invited Gen. 
Carl E. Mundy Jr., commandant of the Marine Corps, but that Mundy ultimately 
declined, citing conflicts in scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Yamashita was a model of restraint, reiterating that he had 
fought his battle for "the principle" and urging Navy and Marine Corps 
officials to do more to make sure that the abuses he suffered would not happen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Yamashita has the right to apply for a transfer to active-duty 
status but he made clear Friday that he probably would remain in civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to savor today," he told reporters before the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 One poignant moment came after several spokesmen of Japanese-American 
organizations pronounced Yamashita's last name the traditional Japanese way -- 
ya-mash-ta -- even though his own family prefers the more-Americanized 
pronunciation, ya-ma-SHI-ta.  
</P>
<P>
 The disparity finally was resolved -- with grace -- by Sen. Daniel K. Akaka 
(D-Hawaii). "You've heard it mentioned as ya-mash-ta, " Akaka said, chuckling 
over the growing dispute. "Well, in Hawaii, we say ya-ma-SHI-ta. " 
</P>
<P>
 Yamashita's ordeal in OCS now is history. On the first day of class, one staff 
sergeant told him: "We don't want your kind around here -- go back to your 
country!" Another suggested that he join the Japanese army. And he was 
routinely called Toyota and Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by the Japanese-American Citizens' League, Yamashita gathered evidence 
showing that between 1982 and 1990, the officers' course had shown "a pattern 
of discrimination" against minorities, who were being dismissed at a far-higher 
rate than white officer candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 After two separate investigations -- and rejections by high-level Navy review 
boards -- Yamashita eventually was offered a commission as a second lieutenant. 
He turned it down on grounds that it did not reflect the time he had lost while 
appealing the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Navy Secretary John H. Dalton and Assistant Secretary of 
the Navy Frederick F. Y. Pang ordered another review, and the Marines finally 
offered Yamashita a commission as a captain in the reserves.

U.S. TO DOUBLE RUSSIA AID FOR DEFENSE PLANT CONVERSION; EUROPE: A 'PRAGMATIC 
PARTNERSHIP' IS CITED. PERRY TELLS MOSCOW THAT $20 MILLION WILL BE ADDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States will double the aid it has pledged for Russian defense 
conversion, allocating $20 million more to help weapons factories produce 
civilian goods in joint ventures with U.S. companies, Defense Secretary William 
J. Perry announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in U.S. aid comes despite rising tensions between Moscow and 
Washington over espionage, the fate of economic reform and Russia's assertive 
new foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and his Russian hosts spoke different languages but used an identical 
phrase -- "pragmatic partnership" -- to describe the changing U.S-Russian 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program announced Friday aims to appease both American critics, who 
argue that aid to Russia would be better spent at home, and Russian 
industrialists, who are frustrated that long-promised Western aid and 
investment have yet to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant money will be distributed through the U.S. firms -- thus ensuring 
that it is spent to convert weapons plants, not upgrade them -- to help defray 
start-up costs of ventures with ailing defense industries in Russia, Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan and Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 One such possible project, Perry said, is a venture to convert one of several 
advanced defense electronics plants -- that are now being privatized -- to 
build personal computers for the Russian market. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials suggested cooperation in commercial satellites, housing 
construction, air traffic control and ticketing, and other civilian 
communication technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to stimulate both the Russian and U.S. economies, 
while requiring most of the capital, labor and technology to be invested by the 
private sector and all of the work to be performed by the two countries' 
private sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense conversion pact was signed by Perry, Russian First Deputy Defense 
Minister Andrei Kokoshin and First Deputy Economics Minister Valery Mikhailov 
on Friday as Perry wound up a two-day visit to Moscow that included talks on 
destroying chemical and biological weapons and on Russia's role in negotiating 
a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The new U.S. defense secretary also met with Prime Minister Viktor S. 
Chernomyrdin, though President Boris N. Yeltsin is vacationing on the Black Sea 
and did not receive him. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Perry was delivering an upbeat assessment of his trip, Foreign 
Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, in article headlined "Don't Threaten Us," chastised 
Western politicians for treating Russia "not as an equal partner but as a 
junior partner." 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is destined to be a great power, not a junior one," Kozyrev wrote in a 
New York Times Op-Ed piece published Friday. "Under Communist or nationalist 
regimes, it would be an aggressive power, while under democratic rule it would 
be peaceful and prosperous. But in either case it would be a great power." 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev warned of "chauvinistic new banners that flap in the Washington wind" 
and argued that "there is simply no alternative to genuine partnership" between 
Russia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In subtler fashion, Mikhailov also drove home the notion that Russia will no 
longer play supplicant for Western aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Even while noting that the defense conversion program had been discussed "in 
an exceptionally amicable and cordial atmosphere," Mikhailov stressed that "we 
are not talking about assistance, but about cooperation and co-production." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry pointedly spoke of a "special role" for Russia in NATO's Partnership for 
Peace program, a loose military cooperation agreement for countries of the 
former Warsaw Pact and newly independent Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 After strongly objecting to its former satellites becoming members of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization before Russia does, Moscow agreed Thursday 
to submit a proposal to join the partnership by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said Russia, as the largest and most powerful member of the partnership, 
would naturally play a greater role in the Partnership for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 In a briefing for Western reporters Friday, Perry said the Partnership for 
Peace idea had been received favorably by about half the members of Parliament 
he had met with a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian skeptics, he said, were much like American critics, some of whom 
favor cutting off aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry argued that both countries have an interest in cooperating on defense 
conversion, disarmament, military cooperation and prevention of nuclear 
proliferation.

N. KOREA DENOUNCES ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea sharply assailed the International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday 
for reporting that Pyongyang had hindered the agency's inspection of its 
nuclear facilities and promised to respond to any "pressure" with "a resolute 
measure." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, President Clinton said Friday that the United States may 
reinstate plans for military maneuvers with South Korea and send Patriot 
missiles there. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, had urged new defensive preparations for U.S. forces in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 And Seoul, in a turnaround, said it was ready to accept the Patriots and hold 
the maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today, talks between South and North Korea broke down after officials 
from the North walked out. The talks had been aimed at the eventual exchange of 
envoys to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, in a statement monitored by radio in Tokyo and Seoul, Pyongyang's 
official Korean Central News Agency insisted that the IAEA rescind this week's 
report stating that North Korea had hindered inspection of its nuclear 
facilities when an IAEA team visited the country March 1-14. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea has a battery of nuclear research facilities at the bend of a 
river in Yongbyong, about 60 miles north of Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long standoff, North Korea agreed Feb. 15 to allow inspectors from the 
IAEA to visit Yongbyong and check for signs of a weapons program. In return, 
the United States and South Korea agreed to suspend the annual joint military 
exercises known as "Team Spirit" for this year, and Washington scheduled a new 
round of direct talks with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the inspection team arrived, it was denied access to sites necessary 
to determine whether North Korea is stockpiling plutonium that could be used 
for bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told reporters that he still is hopeful that North Korea will change 
course and permit full inspection of its nuclear facilities, resume nuclear 
talks with the South and end its isolation from the world community.

WHITE HOUSE TO REVIEW CHINA POLICY; ASIA: SECRETARY OF STATE CALLS TOP-LEVEL 
MEETING TO DETERMINE WHETHER U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE TOUGH HUMAN RIGHTS 
STAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of his turbulent Beijing visit, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher has asked senior American officials to meet early next week to 
review U.S.-China policy and determine whether President Clinton and his 
Administration will continue to support a tough human rights stand. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, one senior State Department official said Friday, Christopher will 
ask, "Do I have any soldiers marching with me on China?" 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials said it will be up to the President to decide where 
the balance should be struck between confronting China over human rights 
abuses, on the one hand, and advancing U.S. commercial and strategic interests 
by improving ties with Beijing, on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which will include Christopher and other Cabinet-level officials, 
is the first hint that the Administration may be about to shift course on China 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But another senior State Department official predicted that there will be no 
major changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The domestic divisions (on China policy) aren't helping," this official 
conceded, adding: "The President is not going to go back on his commitments. 
This is important in terms of his credibility around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has sought to carry out Clinton's May, 1993, executive order, 
which requires China to show "overall, significant progress" on human rights if 
it wants any extension of its low-tariff trade benefits after they expire in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 But the order itself and the tough stance on human rights flowing from it have 
been deeply unpopular with other Administration officials, including some of 
those on the National Economic Council and in the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that China could retaliate against the United States by penalizing 
U.S. businesses and by refusing to cooperate on other foreign policy issues, 
such as stopping North Korea's nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about next week's top-level meeting, Winston Lord, assistant secretary 
of state for East Asia, said: "China is an important policy. We have a couple 
of months to go (before deciding what happens to China's trade benefits), and 
the secretary has just been to China." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord said the meeting will address the question of "Just where are we?" on 
China policy. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trip to Beijing last weekend, Christopher found himself in the 
awkward position of confronting the Chinese regime for its recent arrests of 
dissidents and urging improved ties. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, some State Department officials now believe that the two goals 
may have been incompatible and that the result undermined the credibility of 
the secretary's warnings to Chinese leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But others argue that the firm approach Christopher took in Beijing was 
correct and that it will produce results from Beijing over the next few months 
as long as Clinton and the rest of the Administration are unified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see the end game on this, if we can just get our domestic audience 
under control," one senior State Department official said. "The idea that we're 
in a box on China policy is overstated. The game is not over. The Chinese have 
a stake too." 
</P>
<P>
 The specific issue confronting the Administration is what to do about China's 
most-favored-nation status, under which Chinese goods are imported into this 
country with the same low duties enjoyed by most other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's executive order calls on the secretary of state to recommend this 
spring whether to renew trade benefits next year, based on Christopher's 
judgment of whether the Chinese regime has made progress in several specified 
categories of human rights. These include, for example, China's policy toward 
Tibet, its treatment of political prisoners and its willingness to stop jamming 
Voice of America broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 4, just as Christopher was about to leave for Asia, Chinese officials 
detained or arrested a number of dissidents, including Wei Jingsheng, the 
country's best-known democracy activist. Only a few days earlier, Wei had met 
in Beijing with John Shattuck, the assistant secretary of state for human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 When Christopher arrived in Beijing to press for human rights changes, Chinese 
officials greeted him with an avalanche of angry complaints that the United 
States was interfering in China's internal affairs. They seized on Shattuck's 
meeting with Wei as the focal point for their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official confirmed Friday that Christopher found out 
about Shattuck's meeting only after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened very quickly," the official said. "I don't believe it was cleared 
in advance by Christopher." 
</P>
<P>
 Shattuck told The Times in a telephone interview that "the embassy set the 
meeting up" with Wei. "On previous trips, I have routinely met with other 
people outside the government," he said.

NEW IRA 'SPECTACULARS' SEEN STALLING PEACE; EUROPE: THE HEATHROW ATTACKS ARE 
VIEWED AS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The first four mortar rounds whistled onto runways at Heathrow Airport, one of 
the world's busiest, 10 days ago, leaving their launching pad -- a stolen car 
-- blazing in a hotel parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, four more rounds landed on Heathrow, fired from a wooded area 
near the airport. Then, on Sunday morning, four more, this time fired from a 
scrub area, landed on the airport, one of them on the top of a terminal 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the rounds detonated, though each was stuffed with explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 But these "spectaculars," as the Irish Republican Army is calling them, along 
with almost a dozen disruptions of trains and airport service during the week 
have left little doubt about the IRA's stand on the latest peace initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts on Northern Ireland predict that the attacks on Heathrow, where about 
130,000 travelers arrive and depart on 1,000 flights a day, are just the 
beginning of a renewed mainland campaign by the IRA, which is seeking to force 
the British government to make more concessions. And the hopes for peace, 
raised just a few months ago, are in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a double stalemate at present," said Brendan O'Leary, a political 
scientist and expert on Northern Ireland at the London School of Economics. "It 
is very clear the IRA and Sinn Fein are not going to accept the Downing Street 
Declaration. And the Anglo-Irish peace initiative has been virtually 
suspended." 
</P>
<P>
 The Downing Street Declaration offered Sinn Fein, the outlawed IRA's legal 
political wing, a role in talks on the province within three months of the 
guerrillas' renouncing violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and have the 
province absorbed into the Irish Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 In that declaration, Britain said it had no long-term interest in Northern 
Ireland, a key demand of the IRA. But Britain, balancing its long allegiance to 
the province's Protestant majority, also vowed to respect the electoral wishes 
of the people of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, suggests that the British have not gone 
far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Adams insisted Thursday in a St. Patrick's Day message that peace is 
still possible, he and his colleagues believe that past attacks on the British 
mainland, such as the 1991 mortar attack on the prime minister's offices on 
Downing Street, were key factors in forcing the government to raise the 
possibility of negotiating with Sinn Fein. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are unwilling to give up their armed campaign, figuring that more 
pressure on Prime Minister John Major's government will mean more concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The causes of the conflict are ongoing," Adams told a radio station after the 
first set of mortar shells were fired at Heathrow. "And every so often there 
will be something spectacular to remind the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The British government refuses to be seen to be knuckling under the terrorist 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
 In an anecdote widely reported in Britain, and indicative of that resolve, 
Queen Elizabeth ordered her pilot to "carry on" and land at Heathrow last week 
after she was told that there had been coded, telephoned threats of a mortar 
attack on the airport. Three hours later, an IRA mortar round crashed yards 
from where her flight had touched down. 
</P>
<P>
 With both sides taking entrenched positions, analysts expect the coming weeks 
and months to bring more IRA "spectaculars" and even greater deterioration in 
the peace hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as this stalemate persists, the IRA is likely to step up its campaign 
here," said O'Leary, the political scientist. "And the most likely scenario is 
that the current antagonism will persist, with no end in sight." 
</P>
<P>
 A big question in Britain is whether the IRA ever intended for the mortars to 
explode. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotland Yard said the bombs all had an identical mechanical malfunction. It 
insisted that they were designed to "maim and destroy," and, in fact, the IRA 
has occasionally in the past used armaments that, because of age, had failed to 
detonate. 
</P>
<P>
 One London newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said the IRA was double-crossed 
by one of its operatives, who had disarmed the bombs without permission before 
they were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 But others suggest that the IRA knows that it would be politically disastrous 
to bomb a jetliner, killing untold numbers, many of them likely to be 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more important for the IRA to show they can do this," one expert said. 
"It enhances their threats, raises the security costs and the feeling of 
general uncertainty. From their point of view, that's the kind of trouble they 
want to cause for the British government."

BRUSSELS MAYOR DERIDES PONTIFF, LOSES HIS POWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mayor of Brussels, capital of a Roman Catholic nation, was stripped of 
most of his powers by the City Council on Friday after making irreverent 
comments about Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel Demaret, a former nightclub bouncer long known for his folksy style and 
lack of social graces, also said his own Christian Democratic Party was willing 
to take bribes and alleged that the Belgian judiciary was corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Demaret was quoted in Le Soir Illustre magazine as saying he did 
not care for the Pope's advice in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "Advice of who? Who is this man who doesn't know how to use a condom and puts 
it on the index?" His comments were a play on words, referring both to the 
church's practice of placing banned books on a blacklist, called the index, and 
to putting a condom on the index finger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pope? No, thank you," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul will visit Belgium in May. The main Mass will be held in a Brussels 
park and, according to protocol, he should meet the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Demaret, 54, called in sick Friday, but the City Council went ahead and took 
away most of his powers in hopes that he will resign in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 His party withdrew support of him earlier this week. Elections were already 
planned for October. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS

NEWS ANALYSIS; MEXICO POISED FOR POLITICAL REFORM; ELECTIONS: SPECIAL SESSION 
OF CONGRESS EXPECTED TO PASS MEASURES TO HELP PREVENT BALLOT STUFFING AND TO 
STIFFEN PENALTIES FOR FRAUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing pressure from its citizens, epitomized by a Jan. 1 Indian uprising in 
the southern state of Chiapas, is forcing Mexico's government to match the 
strides made toward opening the economy with similar advances in the 
notoriously closed political system. 
</P>
<P>
 A special session of the Mexican Congress has been called for next week to 
consider far-reaching political reforms that include turning over control of 
the institute that runs elections to citizen groups and toughening legislation 
to punish electoral fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms are assured of passage in a legislature controlled by the highly 
disciplined Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has ruled Mexico for 65 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important is the assurance that the measures will be implemented by 
Interior Secretary Jorge Carpizo MacGregor, whose integrity is widely regarded. 
</P>
<P>
 The package heading toward Congress is the third in the five years of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administration; by far, these measures 
are the most profound. 
</P>
<P>
 They include provisions for revising and correcting voter registration lists 
and voting forms that will help prevent ballot stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite earlier indications from unnamed government officials, they stop short 
of giving international observers a formal role. They do, however, contemplate 
that "foreign visitors" will call on polling places on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans have viewed their election process with skepticism for decades, 
widely suspecting the PRI, as the ruling party is known, of alchemy: magically 
transforming votes for the opposition into votes for the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1988 presidential election, the computer tallying system mysteriously 
crashed, leading many Mexicans to suspect that Salinas did not receive a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Salinas' term, the administration has resisted significant 
political changes, even as it implemented wide-ranging free-market economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous state elections have been so marred by fraud and citizen marches on 
the Zocalo -- Mexico City's main plaza and the site of frequent political 
demonstrations -- that the administration has been forced to install interim 
governors and call new elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But what forced the government to propose the latest round of political 
reforms was an uprising in Chiapas that left at least 145 people dead, 
political analyst Jorge Castaneda said. "They thought that if there were 
charges of fraud, it would be just the same old guys in the Zocalo. But now, 
it's guys with guns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel demands include guarantees of clean elections or the resignation of 
Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has refused to negotiate national political issues with the 
guerrillas, who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army. The 
proposed reforms, however, clearly address many of the guerrillas' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel spokesman Subcommander Marcos said earlier this week that the Zapatistas 
will end the current cease-fire unless they see substantial signs of a move 
toward greater democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an overall fear of major turmoil after the (presidential) election" 
on Aug. 21, Castaneda said. "They are scared that the whole place will go 
haywire if any candidate contests the results." 
</P>
<P>
 Those fears have been fed by the kidnaping this week of Alfredo Harp Helu, 
chairman of Mexico's largest financial group, he said. While the kidnaping -- 
which sent the national stock market plunging -- is apparently unrelated to the 
Chiapas uprising, it provides an additional indication of instability, 
Castaneda said. One of Mexico's key attractions for foreign investors 
traditionally has been its stability. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed reforms are the result of negotiations among the country's nine 
registered political parties and Carpizo. 
</P>
<P>
 While they represent the most substantive changes in decades, the reforms 
stopped far short of proposals to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow Mexicans living abroad to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Revive coalitions among different parties, a tactic that opposition 
presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas used to build a coalition in 1988.

BRAZIL FUGITIVES HELD IN KIDNAPING OF CHURCH LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine of 14 fugitive prisoners who held Roman Catholic Cardinal Dom Aloisio 
Lorscheider hostage during a jail break have been captured, police officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police shot and killed one of the fugitives Friday morning and another, 
Roberto Francisco de Aguiar Muniz, was wounded, said military police Col. 
Nilson Evangelista by telephone from Quixada, in northeastern Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Muniz, who is from Quixada, reportedly served as a guide to the fugitives as 
they hid in the surrounding hills. "Now that they have lost their leader, it 
should be easy to catch the remaining five," Evangelista said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorscheider, the 69-year-old Archbishop of Fortaleza and onetime candidate for 
Pope, was taken hostage with 12 other people at knifepoint Tuesday while 
visiting a maximum-security jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostages were released unharmed after police chased an armored van that 
was used to carry the prisoners and their captives out of the jail in 
Fortaleza, 90 miles north of Quixada. 
</P>
<P>
 The police chase continued as the fugitive inmates abandoned the van and fled 
on foot to the hills known as Serra Azul. 
</P>
<P>
 Police captured six of the hungry and exhausted fugitives Thursday and the 
other three Friday.

JAILED CALIFORNIA WOMAN DIES IN ISRAEL; MIDEAST: SETTLER ROCHELLE MANNING, 54, 
WAS AWAITING EXTRADITION FOR TRIAL IN A LETTER-BOMB MURDER. SHE WAS A FRIEND OF 
BARUCH GOLDSTEIN, WHO MASSACRED ABOUT 30 ARABS.

 Rochelle Manning -- a radical Jewish settler who was awaiting extradition to 
California for trial in the letter-bomb murder of a Manhattan Beach secretary 
-- died Friday in an Israeli prison, a government spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, 54, had fainted after morning prayers at the prison outside Tel Aviv. 
She lost consciousness and died 45 minutes later of an apparent heart attack, 
said Dubi Ben-Ami, a Prisons Authority spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy is planned, as Manning did not have a known heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, who immigrated to Israel in 1986, had lived in Kiryat Arba, a 
militant Jewish settlement near Hebron in the West Bank, where she and her 
husband were close friends of Dr. Baruch Goldstein, another American immigrant, 
who massacred about 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview a week ago with the weekly newspaper Kol Hair, Manning 
recounted that Goldstein had told her in January how depressed he had grown 
after the upsurge in attacks on Jewish settlers in Kiryat Arba and Hebron, 
particularly the murder of a close friend and his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me he felt he was going crazy," Manning said in the interview. "He 
was terribly hurt by the murder (in December) of Mordechai Lapid and his son 
Shalom. . . . He was the last person I would think could do something like that 
(the Hebron massacre), but on second thought he was the only one who could have 
done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's Supreme Court earlier this month turned down Manning's final appeal 
against an extradition order returning her to the United States to stand trial 
in the 1980 death of Patricia Wilkerson, who was killed when a bomb hidden in 
an electrical appliance exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning's husband, Robert, was extradited to the United States last July, 
convicted in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles of conspiracy to murder and 
sentenced to life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged in that trial that the bomb was intended for Wilkerson's 
boss, Brenda Crouthamel Adams, at the Prowest Computer Corp. and that the 
Mannings had been hired by Los Angeles real estate broker William Ross, who had 
a protracted business dispute with Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Manning was tried with Ross for the murder in 1988, but the jury 
couldn't reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 She was arrested in 1991 in Israel, and for three years she fought 
extradition. Ross recently was returned from Canada to Los Angeles, where he 
awaits retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mannings had been active with Ross in the Jewish Defense League, founded 
by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, which has provided many of the members of 
Israel's extremist Kach movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel banned Kach this week as a "terrorist organization." 
</P>
<P>
 In Kiryat Arba, the Mannings were regarded, with Goldstein, as among Kach's 
most radical supporters; Israel Army Radio said neighbors described them as 
"Bonnie and Clyde" for their willingness to use arms against Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Kach advocates the use of violence to drive Arabs from the biblical Land of 
Israel.  
</P>
<P>
 But friends expressed great sorrow at Rochelle Manning's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have maintained she was innocent," said Rabbi Kenny Cohen, who had known 
the Mannings in Los Angeles as well as in Kiryat Arba. "We are saddened that 
the government of Israel and its people did not stand up for her. I think 
everyone here knew she was innocent, including people in the (Israeli) 
government. . . . But no one had the courage to say, 'We are not sending her.'

IRAQ REPORTEDLY MASSING TROOPS IN KURDISH AREA; MILITARY: U.S. CAUTIONS BAGHDAD 
AGAINST USING FORCE AGAINST POPULATION IN THE NORTHERN REGION.

 Iraq has moved more than 2,000 elite troops into a largely Kurdish area north 
of Baghdad, drawing a stiff warning from the United States against any military 
action, senior U.S. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Iraqis have moved four battalions of Republican Guard infantry into the 
area around Mosul," an official said, citing U.S. intelligence reports. "We 
want to make it clear to the Iraqi government that we will continue . . . to 
enforce (United Nations) Security Council resolutions in that area. It would be 
unwise of them to test our resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council has prohibited Iraq from mounting offensive military 
operations against the Kurds, a non-Arab ethnic group that is the majority of 
the population in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen this kind of troop movement before, but this is a higher level 
than we've seen in more than a year," the official said. "Whether it is just 
saber-rattling or whether he intends to challenge the U.N., we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations in New York, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told the 
Security Council of the troop movements, a spokesman said. "We do not know 
whether (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein intends to renew his offensive against 
his own people, but he clearly wishes to intimidate them, as well as the 
Security Council," Albright said, according to her spokesman, James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright denounced the troop movements in a closed-door Security Council 
debate over a proposed statement on Iraq's degree of compliance with the 1991 
cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-nation council agreed Wednesday to maintain economic sanctions against 
Iraq but was divided over whether to praise Hussein for cooperating with U.N. 
weapons inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, China and France supported a proposed statement that would have lauded 
Iraq's cooperation, but the United States and Britain were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq is asking the United Nations to lift its embargo on oil exports, the 
country's main product. The U.N. resolutions that imposed the embargo said it 
could be lifted if Iraq openly declared and destroyed all its ballistic 
missiles and other weapons of mass destruction and agreed to international 
monitoring. Iraq claims to have met those conditions, but the United States 
disagrees.

32 DIE AS IRANIAN PLANE STRAYS, CRASHES IN KARABAKH WAR ZONE 
</P>

<P>
 An Iranian plane crashed in the war-torn Caucasus enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh 
after having strayed off course, killing all 32 people on board, an Armenian 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some military experts said the C-130 Hercules, taking families of Iranian 
Embassy staff home from Moscow on Thursday for Muslim New Year celebrations, 
could have been shot down. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia's first deputy foreign minister, Zhirair Liparityan, told a news 
conference that the plane should have flown over Russia, Georgia and Armenia 
before reaching Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons that remained unclear, it veered about 65 miles east of this 
corridor as it left Georgia and did not enter Armenian airspace as scheduled at 
10:08 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it flew into the war zone around Nagorno-Karabakh, an 
Armenian-populated area in Azerbaijan whose independence-minded inhabitants 
have invaded and conquered a large chunk of Azerbaijani territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Liparityan said it was not clear what had happened between then and 10:30 
p.m., when the plane crashed just a few miles north of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
capital, Stepanakert. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iranian Embassy in Moscow said the aircraft was carrying 19 passengers, 
including nine children, and a crew of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted military experts as saying the plane 
"could well have been shot down by a mobile antiaircraft missile system."

NEWS ANALYSIS; FACED WITH A TV WAR, EUROPEANS SWITCH OFF; BOSNIA: BLOODY IMAGES 
DISTURB THE CONTINENT'S PSYCHE MUCH AS VIETNAM ERODED AMERICA'S, BUT PUBLIC 
REMAINS SILENT.

<P>
 For most Europeans, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a remote conflict that 
starts and ends with the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 The images of hunger, death and destruction beamed from Sarajevo and the many 
faceless smaller towns elsewhere in Bosnia begin their nightly rounds with the 
early evening television news in Germany and roll through millions of living 
rooms on the Continent before the night's final summaries conclude in Britain 
several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an unpleasant but shared experience -- Europe's first television war. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the war in Bosnia has parallels with America's first television 
war nearly a generation ago: Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as Americans once did, Europeans each evening confront a relentless, 
deeply disturbing conflict whose very ugliness flies in the face of the values 
they profess. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as the Vietnam quagmire fed American self-doubt and eroded national 
self-confidence, so has the war in Bosnia had a corrosive, demoralizing impact 
here, mocking the dreams of those who yearn for a united Europe and 
undercutting their influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the deepest recession since the 1930s and other worrisome 
uncertainties in the former Communist East, the Bosnian war is a key 
contributor to the climate of pessimism and uncertainty that hangs over much of 
the Old World today. 
</P>
<P>
 "One has to question the state of Europe today if 350 million Europeans can't 
save the 350,000 inhabitants of Sarajevo," France's former minister of 
humanitarian affairs, Bernard Kouchner, wrote in a commentary in the European 
weekly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Summed up Peter Ludlow, director of the Center for European Policy Studies 
here: "It's thoroughly demoralizing in just about every way." 
</P>
<P>
 In the struggle between those pushing for greater economic and political 
integration and those working to reignite the long-dormant flames of 
nationalist hatred -- a struggle that many see as the great drama of post-Cold 
War Europe -- the war in Bosnia stands as a symbol of the power and 
destructiveness of nationalistic passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this, however, the European public seems eerily silent. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic images from Bosnia have yet to shake any European government to 
its foundations. Nor have they ignited violent anti-war clashes such as those 
that chased the Democrats from the White House and threatened to tear the 
United States apart in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the biggest split of public opinion in Europe about the Bosnian war is 
whether to become involved at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the leaders of Western Europe's potentially powerful peace movement, who 
mobilized millions to oppose the deployment of U.S. nuclear missiles during the 
1980s and marched again in early 1991 to protest the Western attack against 
Iraq, have all but ignored the first major war on their continent since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sense of non-involvement is most worrying," Oxford University historian 
Williams Wallace said. "Sure, there are small groups sending food and clothing, 
but that's really it. I get no sense of public urgency." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace noted that this mood of non-involvement exists despite the reality 
that before the breakup of Yugoslavia, Adriatic coastal resorts in the region 
were among the most popular of all vacation spots for sun-starved northern 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly, everyone switched off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all European governments, only France has so far openly pushed for military 
action to back up the futile diplomatic threats to end the war. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the public apathy reflects the inability of many Europeans to relate 
to a conflict that, although less than an hour's flying time from Vienna or 
Rome, has little impact on their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is that -- unlike what happened in Vietnam -- very few 
"outsiders" are dying in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that France and Britain are the two largest contributors of 
manpower to U.N. peacekeeping forces in the region. But the 77 peacekeepers 
killed in the former Yugoslav federation make up a number dwarfed by the 
casualties that helped motivate opposition to the Vietnam War, which claimed 
more than 50,000 U.S. lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Another important factor is that Germany, Western Europe's largest and richest 
power, a country that has taken in more than 200,000 refugees from the war 
region and where public sentiment runs high "to do something," remains 
paralyzed by its history and its own constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, German leaders admit that even if their country's constitution were 
amended to permit the country to engage in military action outside the Western 
Alliance area, the lingering memory in the Balkans of Nazi-era atrocities there 
would make it impossible for Bonn to deploy forces there. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbed of the Franco-German partnership so crucial for mobilizing 
multinational action, the 12-nation European Union has instead been limited 
mainly to issuing empty diplomatic threats and offering a political settlement 
that it cannot impose on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who believe that Europe should act, the frustration is 
considerable. They question the ultimate fate of a people that fails to defend 
its most basic values. 
</P>
<P>
 "After everything we've heard, what still has to happen for us to finally 
decide no longer to just watch?" an anguished young German legislator, Stefan 
Schwarz, asked in December, 1992, after reports of especially gruesome Serbian 
atrocities. "How, I'd like to ask, can one just watch when people are 
slaughtered?" 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 months and countless further shocks later, his questions remain 
unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Feb. 5 artillery attack on a Sarajevo marketplace that 
claimed 68 lives, the Belgian daily Le Soir echoed, "How much longer is this 
horror going to go on?" 
</P>
<P>
 There is already evidence that the war's fallout is likely to influence 
Europe's future. 
</P>
<P>
 It has shaken public confidence in the idea of a collective European foreign 
and security policy and has shown that such action remains more an ideal than a 
reality, despite the high-profile commitments to political union made by the 12 
European Union nations in their 1991 Maastricht Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The confused, often conflicting responses from European capitals have also 
made it clear that the region's major powers are still incapable of acting 
without U.S. involvement in a major crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this, it is the advocates of European integration and multinational 
bodies such as the European Union, rather than national governments, that have 
lost credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is Europe, not national governments, that have failed," Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois Heisbourg, former director of the London-based International 
Institute of Strategic Studies and now a senior figure in French industry, 
argued in an interview that the European Union's inaction in Bosnia was at 
least partly responsible for the unexpectedly close French ratification of the 
Maastricht Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ludlow noted: "The siege (of Sarajevo) began right in the middle of the 
post-Maastricht euphoria. The commitment to the idea of a common foreign and 
security (policy) was too new, too fresh. The timing was unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Another alarming message of the Bosnian conflict, however, comes with the 
spectacular disintegration of multicultural life in Sarajevo, a city once held 
up as a model of social integration. 
</P>
<P>
 Events in the Bosnian capital not only demonstrate the power of nationalistic 
emotions but raise unsettling questions about the fate of ethnic tensions 
elsewhere in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will the reaction be when old conflicts between Poles and Lithuanians or 
Hungarians and Slovaks erupt again?" asked Joachim Boelke, a commentator for 
the German national daily Die Welt. "Almost as an aside, the West has given 
away one of the basic principles that will determine the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this, some insist that the legacy of the war is not all negative 
for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludlow said the Balkans war had opened the door to a possible new trilateral 
partnership for maintaining order in 21st-Century Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way things are playing out, a new relationship is emerging between the 
United States, the EU and Russia," he said. "They are suddenly being forced to 
collaborate on very different terms."

SECOND-LONGEST SHUTTLE FLIGHT ENDS SAFELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The space shuttle Columbia and its crew returned safely Friday from the 
second-longest trip in shuttle history, a two-week journey that provided tips 
for building a better space station. 
</P>
<P>
 The research mission ended just an hour short of the longest shuttle flight, 
made by Columbia last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been nice to get the record, but it was a great flight," 
shuttle commander John Casper said before heading home to Houston. "We're 
really pleased with it. I think we did a lot of good things." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists called the mission a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bring home a treasure which I believe is of considerable value," said 
Peter Curreri, National Aeronautics and Space Administration mission scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-ton shuttle sailed through a clear morning sky and landed on time at 
the space center. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial TV views showed Columbia fishtailing on the runway before coming to a 
stop, unusual but of no concern to shuttle managers. Casper said he was just 
trying to stay on the center line. 
</P>
<P>
 A few objects were seen falling off NASA's oldest shuttle as it rolled down 
the runway; they turned out to be devices for deploying the drag chute. An 
inspection later revealed some missing pieces: six thermal covers from the 
nose-wheel compartment and one thermal tile from the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a normal situation that they fly off like that, but it did not 
endanger the vehicle or the crew," NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5.8-million-mile mission, which began March 4, featured 11 major science 
experiments worth nearly $100 million. Most were commanded by remote control 
from the ground -- a method called "telescience" -- leaving the astronauts 
tending to such chores as medical and engineering tests, and rat and plant 
checks.

NORTH'S PILOT DIES IN CRASH OF PLANE 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oliver L. North's campaign plane crashed Friday on its way to an early morning 
political event, killing the pilot. North had gotten off the plane hours 
before, and no one else was on board. 
</P>
<P>
 North, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate, had flown 
from a campaign appearance in southside Virginia on Thursday night to 
Washington Dulles Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Bobby R. Venable flew on to Winchester, and the two had planned to fly 
to Richmond together later Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why I'm still here and others aren't," North said. "I just know 
I've lost a dear friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the twin-engine Swearingen Merlin IIIA apparently had engine 
trouble and went down shortly after midnight, about a quarter-mile from the 
Winchester airport.

ALTMAN DISCLOSES 2ND MEETING ON S&L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman disclosed that he held a second meeting 
with White House officials about matters relating to a defunct Arkansas savings 
and loan linked to the Whitewater affair, a letter released Friday shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, who has been acting head of the Resolution Trust Corp., said he met 
with White House aide Harold M. Ickes last month to discuss disqualifying 
himself from the case involving Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the head of the Senate Banking Committee, Altman played down 
the White House contact, saying there "was no discussion of the case itself" 
and that he had not sought -- nor was he given -- advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman said he recalled the second meeting after reviewing his own files. He 
did so after saying at a Senate hearing last month that he had given White 
House officials a "heads-up" on how the RTC was proceeding with aspects of the 
Madison case. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings and loan was owned by James B. McDougal, President and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's partner in their Whitewater land investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, the senior Republican on the Banking 
Committee, called for Altman's resignation.

SIZING UP THE CIA IN COLD WAR'S WAKE; SPYING: SCHOLARS AND ALUMNI SEE THE 
AGENCY AS SEEKING TO FIND A MISSION. THE ROLE OF COVERT OPERATIONS IS 
QUESTIONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1946 when President Harry S. Truman swore in the nation's first director of 
central intelligence, a Missouri businessman named Sidney Souers, Truman 
presented him with a black cloak and hat and a wooden dagger and dubbed him 
"director of central snooping." 
</P>
<P>
 To many of the 200 scholars and CIA alumni who have met here for the last two 
days to ponder the implications of the CIA's early years, Truman's sometimes 
irreverent view of the mystique of international espionage served as a valuable 
guide to assessing the agency's future in the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am continually impressed as to how right Harry Truman's instincts were to 
be skeptical, particularly about covert action, even if the implementation 
sometimes was off," says Cold War scholar John Lewis Gaddis of Ohio University. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which took place a short drive from the CIA's Langley, Va., 
headquarters, came at a time of deep turmoil in the agency caused by 
revelations that its Cold War mission was severely compromised by a high-placed 
mole who allegedly sold national security secrets to the Soviet Union and later 
Russia over a period of nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent allegations about Aldrich H. Ames have once again raised questions 
about the agency's objectives and techniques. The conference, scheduled long 
before Ames' Feb. 21 arrest, served as a reminder that those questions have 
dogged the agency throughout its history. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference also pointed up a strong parallel between the challenges facing 
the agency at its inception and those confronting it today -- both times of 
great change. The CIA of the 1990s is struggling to find its mission in a world 
dominated by a single superpower. In Truman's era, the agency was trying to 
define its role in the Cold War rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1945, not long after he took office and celebrated the end of World War II, 
Truman terminated the Office of Strategic Services, the country's wartime 
intelligence agency, dispersing what was left of its functions between the War 
and State departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "But between 1945 and 1947 the shooting war against German fascism turned into 
a Cold War against Russian communism and the international political order was 
turned upside down," Stanford University historian Barry Katz pointed out at 
one of the panel discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "National security was defined then as being against the Soviet Union," said 
Tom Allen, co-author of "Merchants of Treason," a book about espionage over the 
last decade. The question now, he said, is "what is the definition of national 
security and what is the job of the CIA?" 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to answer such questions nearly half a century ago, scholars believe 
that Truman probably benefited from the hard-headed "show me" attitude and 
motto of his home state of Missouri. "This is as big a lot of top secret 
malarkey as I've ever seen," he wrote on one briefing paper, according to Gen. 
Donald Dawson, president of the Truman Library Institute, which co-sponsored 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Truman's patriotic pride, bordering on chauvinism, 
sometimes made him reject well-grounded warnings about the threat from Joseph 
Stalin's Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Stalin flexed his muscles in Eastern Europe, Truman became convinced, 
more than he later liked to admit, of the need for a powerful intelligence 
agency to counter the Soviet threat. Only a few months after abolishing the 
OSS, he installed Souers, who was a rear admiral in the Naval Reserve, as head 
of a new organization -- the Central Intelligence Group, which less than two 
years later was superseded by the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1948, in the wake of the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, and the 
Soviet blockade of Berlin, Truman signed the fateful National Security 
directive 10/2, included in the 473-page compendium of documents distributed at 
the conference, which authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The directive, which over the years would become the focal point of critics 
who depicted the CIA as a reckless and sinister force, asserted that covert 
operations should be carried out in such a way so that, "if uncovered, the U.S. 
government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them." 
</P>
<P>
 This covert role, unlike any other official activity ever conducted by the 
U.S. government, soon created concern within the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Truman did nothing to rein in the agency's covert operations, which included 
bolstering anti-communist forces in the Italian elections and the French labor 
movement and checking the Communist dominated Huk guerrillas in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he had any idea that covert operations would become as huge as 
it became and that it would lead to Guatemala and Iran," where the CIA helped 
to overthrow established regimes during the administration of President Dwight 
D. Eisenhower, said University of Toronto professor Wesley Wark. 
</P>
<P>
 Other operations followed, including the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion that 
President John F. Kennedy allowed to go forward, and unsavory episodes in 
Indonesia, Burma, Vietnam and elsewhere. In 1964, a dozen years after Truman 
left office, he finally came down hard on the CIA's covert mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency had been so far removed from its "intended role" of intelligence 
gathering, Truman complained in a newspaper column, that it is "being 
interpreted as a symbol of sinister and mysterious foreign intrigue -- and a 
subject for Cold War enemy propaganda."

GOVERNMENT AGREES TO DELAY INDICTMENTS IN CIA SPY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government agreed Friday to postpone any espionage indictment of Aldrich 
H. and Rosario Ames so that defense lawyers will have time to examine 
classified documents the couple is accused of compromising. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment of the 31-year CIA veteran and his wife by a federal grand jury 
in Alexandria, Va., had been expected by Wednesday, 30 days after their arrest 
by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ameses and their attorneys filed a motion for a 30-day delay in U.S. 
District Court. Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark J. Hulkower noted on the motion that 
the government did not object. 
</P>
<P>
 William Cummings, attorney for Rosario Ames, said he and Plato Cacheris, the 
lawyer for Aldrich Ames, "haven't even gotten our security clearances yet, and 
we need those to look at some of the materials they allege were compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 The clearances are expected shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has charged that Ames, a former chief of counterintelligence in 
the CIA's Soviet section, spied for the Soviets and then the Russians since 
1985. His wife is charged with helping him in the conspiracy.

SLAYINGS SPREAD ANGER, DISTRUST IN LITTLE HAITI; INVESTIGATION: RESIDENTS SAY 
OFFICIALS IGNORE THE POLITICS BEHIND DEATHS OF 4 ARISTIDE SUPPORTERS IN MIAMI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Little Haiti, storefront rallies regularly spill into the street. Walls are 
replastered daily with fresh broadsides against enemies. Shade-tree discussions 
begin hot and grow hotter. Everything seems political. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially murder. 
</P>
<P>
 When Daniel Buron was gunned down in front of a friend's house last week -- 
making him the fourth well-known supporter of exiled Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to have been assassinated here since 1991 -- another 
wave of fear swept through the enclave of 60,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the markets and barbershops, men and women talk passionately about the 
perils of speaking out and shake their heads over the tragedy of the 
bloodletting. But few express surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are used to threats and to death," said Rolande Dorancy, executive 
director of the Haitian Refugee Center. "We have learned to live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the police to make any arrests in connection with the slaying 
of Buron, 31, an outspoken political activist, has renewed concerns that 
solving murders in the Haitian community is not a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
 The three earlier victims were all popular radio broadcasters. Although three 
arrests have been made in connection with those slayings, the triggermen have 
not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "If leaders in the Cuban community were being shot this way, the FBI and the 
White House would be tripping over each other trying to solve this as a 
national priority," said Steven Forester, an attorney for the refugee center. 
"But these are black Haitians, without political clout, and it seems like it's 
open season on exiles here." 
</P>
<P>
 Buron was killed minutes after leaving an evening executive council meeting of 
Veye Yo, a pro-democracy political group whose name means "watch them" in 
Creole. Standing in front of a friend's house, Buron was talking to the friend 
and another man on March 9 when two gunmen approached on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a word, witnesses say, the strangers opened fire with automatic 
weapons. Buron was hit several times. His two companions escaped injury by 
diving under a nearby car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they are uncertain if Buron was an assassination target. Miami 
Police Detective George Gil says the two gunmen may have been would-be robbers 
who got scared, shot and ran. 
</P>
<P>
 "His activities were political, so people think the killing has to be 
political," Gil said. "But we're getting very little information from the 
community on this. They are not talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians are often reluctant to talk to the police. "The nature of the 
community presents language and cultural problems that make it hard for the 
police to penetrate," said Father Tom Wenski, a Creole-speaking priest at Notre 
Dame d'Haiti here. "People don't have a lot of confidence in police because of 
their experience in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, both uniformed police and irregulars such as the Tontons Macoute 
have been brutal enforcers for oppressive regimes, including those of the 
Duvalier family and the current military government headed by the army 
commander, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, diplomats and U.N. observers in Haiti reported that 75 people have 
been killed and their bodies mutilated recently in an effort to end support for 
Aristide, the elected president who was forced into exile in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The first murder of a prominent Haitian in Miami occurred in February, 1991, 
the same month Aristide took office. Radio personality Jean-Claude Olivier, 47, 
was walking to his car from a nightclub when he was hit by three bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five days later another well-known broadcaster, Fritz Dor, 33, was 
killed outside his office in Little Haiti. The third broadcaster killed was 
Dona St. Plite, who was shot last October after a benefit for Dor's family. 
</P>
<P>
 All three men were outspoken supporters of Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant State Atty. John Kastrenakas says that although the murders of 
Olivier, Dor and St. Plite were apparently carried out by contract killers, the 
motives were related to local business dealings and not politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men have been charged in connection with those killings, but none are 
accused of being a gunman or the person who paid for the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know who the shooter is, but we don't have enough evidence to bring 
charges," Kastrenakas said. "But I'm not too worried because he's in jail on 
other charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Kastrenakas says he is aware of the Haitian community's mistrust of police 
investigations and understands the widespread belief that the killings are 
linked to politics here and in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were hoping to overthrow the government in Haiti, I would want to put 
forward that theory, too," he said. "I understand it, but that doesn't mean I 
support it. I don't deal in rumor and innuendo. There is just no evidence of 
politics here." 
</P>
<P>
 People on the street do not accept that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Aristide's election, we have had so much of this killing," said Jesse 
Mesidor, 26. "We are sure these are not accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders also say they find the prosecutor's version hard to accept. 
Many powerful figures in the Haitian military, including Cedras and Gen. 
Prosper Avril, own property, have family members and claim supporters in 
southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecutor says this businessman, whose name they won't give, is a major 
drug dealer," Forester said. "Well, people know that drug dealers are connected 
with powers that be in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorancy, whose name was on a list of 36 people targeted in an anonymous 
death-threat letter mailed last fall to the refugee center, says the killings 
fit a pattern of intimidation being conducted here and in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Dorancy's former nanny in Port-au-Prince was kidnaped and 
decapitated in a warning "that they will kill me if I don't shut up," she said.

APPELLATE COURT BLOCKS ORDER TO TRANSFER PAROLED SERIAL RAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rural county's crusade to banish a paroled rapist hit a snag Friday when an 
appellate court blocked enforcement of an order that would have forced state 
officials to move him. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by the 3rd District Court of Appeal left the fate of serial rapist 
Melvin A. Carter, who was paroled Thursday near the Modoc County town of 
Alturas, in doubt pending court action next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured we'd hit a few brick walls, but we're certainly not giving up," 
said Joe Colt, chairman of the Modoc County Board of Supervisors. "We're going 
to keep fighting until somebody listens and we win." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's parole has ignited controversy because he confessed to 100 rapes and 
served half of a 25-year sentence he received for 12 of them. Initially, state 
corrections officials planned to release Carter in the Bay Area county of 
Alameda, where he committed most of his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a public uproar, Gov. Pete Wilson altered that decision, ordering 
him sent to "as remote a location as possible." On Thursday, he was sneaked 
into Modoc County in the trunk of a car and released at the state's Devil's 
Garden Conservation Camp, which houses minimum security inmates who work on 
fire crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged that Carter was being shipped to their ranching community, residents 
quickly rose up, staging raucous rallies and candlelight vigils and threatening 
to kill the rapist.  
</P>
<P>
 Early Thursday, a Superior Court judge issued a restraining order forbidding 
Carter's release in Modoc County. In seeking the order, the district attorney 
argued that the state violated a law requiring that parolees return to the 
county where their crimes were committed unless special circumstances exist. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the state attorney general asked the appellate court to overturn 
the restraining order, arguing that Modoc County had no authority to block 
Carter's release. The state's lawyers said Carter was not paroled to Alameda 
County because many of his victims live there and it hosts several college 
campuses, which were Carter's targets. If the court had sided with Modoc 
County, corrections officials would have been required to relocate Carter -- 
and, indeed, were preparing to do so. Instead, the court delayed a resolution, 
requesting further information from the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Modoc County residents laid plans for a protest trip to Sacramento 
on Monday and continued to demonstrate in downtown Alturas. On Thursday night, 
Carter was burned in effigy. One popular sign bore the face of the rapist 
overlaid with the cross hairs of a gun sight and the caption: "He Won't Be 
Living Here Long."

VISTA SCHOOLS OK SEX EDUCATION PROGRAM WITH RELIGIOUS THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that may be challenged in court, the school board of this San 
Diego-area city voted Friday to adopt a controversial sex education program 
with religious overtones that preaches a strict message of sexual abstinence 
and avoids the mention of contraception. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex Respect, which has been legally challenged in school districts across the 
country, was chosen by the school board over a state-sanctioned family life 
program, despite costing $30 more per student. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of Sex Respect said they expect to sue the district when the program 
is implemented in July. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional meeting that lasted until early Friday, the Christian 
conservative majority of the five-member board also voted to replace its staff 
attorneys with anti-abortion lawyer David Llewellyn of Sacramento, who often 
represents Christian political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Donovan, chairwoman of Community Action for Public Education, said 
that by hiring Llewellyn, the board is gearing up for her group's expected 
legal challenge to Sex Respect. "Why hire someone with a specialty unless you 
know you'll need the specialty?" asked Donovan, who called Sex Respect a 
fear-based program that "they're using to lord their moral values over the 
consideration of everyone else in Vista. This was not a popular decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Angry parents and teachers often raised their voices in protest against board 
President Deidre Holliday and members John Tyndall and Joyce Lee, who were the 
targets of a recent failed recall bid. Recall proponents failed to gather 
enough signatures but vow another recall attempt in November.

MAI ZETTERLING, 68; SWEDISH FILM ACTRESS TURNED DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mai Zetterling, the stunning Swedish actress for whom Ingmar Bergman wrote his 
first film script 50 years ago, has died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joyce Edwards dramatic agency announced Friday that its client -- who 
years ago abandoned acting for directing -- was 68 when she died in London on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Zetterling, who co-starred with Anjelica Huston in "The Witches," a 
children's fantasy, and was featured in films involving such disparate actors 
as Peter Sellers, Tyrone Power, Dirk Bogarde and Danny Kaye, had never realized 
her potential as a director because she refused to direct many scripts offered 
her, branding them "rubbish." 
</P>
<P>
 From her earliest days as a young actress in Sweden, she was known as a 
confrontational feminist, less interested in the commercial aspects of her 
pictures than their universality. 
</P>
<P>
 When she moved from in front of the cameras to behind them, she also abandoned 
glamorous trappings, cut her hair severely and made films dealing graphically 
with women's issues -- prostitution, motherhood and lesbianism. 
</P>
<P>
 Such pictures as "Scrubbers," "The Girls," "Loving Couples" and several more, 
distributed primarily in Europe, were diametrical opposites of "Torment," 
Bergman's first picture, in which Miss Zetterling portrayed one of two young 
lovers beset by a sadistic teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Also released as "Frenzy" and "Hets," it remains among her better-known 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 She came to America in the 1950s and appeared alongside Sellers in "Only Two 
Can Play," with Power in "Abandon Ship" and with Bogarde in "Desperate Mount." 
</P>
<P>
 She left acting, she said, "because I was not a passive person," and her 
career suffered because of the limited demand for women directors. But in 1963 
she was given a $6,000 budget and asked to film a British documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came "Night Games" and "Loving Couples" and a stint as one of eight 
directors of "Visions of Eight," a highly praised film about the 1972 Olympic 
Games in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Zetterling also wrote a number of books, including her autobiography, 
"All Those Tomorrows." 
</P>
<P>
 In that book she told of being born to a working-class family in Stockholm and 
leaving school barely literate. 
</P>
<P>
 After working in a drugstore and a mail-order firm, she tried acting, was 
invited to a school, and at age 17 joined the National Theater School in 
Stockholm, where she met Bergman. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of her death, Miss Zetterling was directing a film entitled "The 
Woman Who Cleaned the World." 
</P>
<P>
 Her survivors include a son and daughter.

PURDUE OFFICIAL TO HEAD UC SANTA BARBARA; EDUCATION: REGENTS SELECT DEAN OF 
ENGINEERING SCHOOL, ENDING A SEVEN-MONTH SEARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The University of California regents Friday named Henry T. Yang, dean of 
Purdue University's School of Engineering, as the new chancellor of UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang, who has taught and been an administrator at the Indiana university for 
25 years, will be paid $175,000 a year as UC Santa Barbara's fifth chief 
administrator. He succeeds Barbara Uehling, who had been criticized by faculty 
members for her academic leadership and announced in May that she would resign 
before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Yang, 53, ends a seven-month search in which more than 150 
candidates were interviewed, university officials said. Yang received his 
undergraduate degree in 1962 from National Taiwan University before earning his 
master's at West Virginia University in 1965 and his Ph.D. from Cornell 
University in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang joined Purdue's faculty as an assistant professor in 1969 and received 11 
undergraduate teaching awards. In 1984, he became engineering dean, in charge 
of a faculty of 300 and 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
 UC President Jack Peltason said that under Yang's leadership, Purdue produced 
the largest number of female engineers in the country and helped encourage the 
Big 10 schools to increase their numbers of Latino and African American 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything about him is superlatives," Peltason said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang told reporters that he intends to teach an undergraduate class after he 
takes over as chancellor June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming to the university system during one of its toughest economic eras, Yang 
said he was not knowledgeable enough yet to answer questions about whether any 
cuts will be needed in the $309-million budget at the Santa Barbara campus, 
which has 18,600 students and 4,800 faculty and staff members.  
</P>
<P>
 In other action Thursday, the regents voted 10 to 6 to sell a 1,120-acre ranch 
in Sonoma County that was donated to the university in 1974. The action capped 
nearly four hours of prolonged testimony and discussion over what to do with 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty members urged the regents to hold onto the property because its 400 
plant species, streams and wetlands made it fertile ground for research. But 
the city of Santa Rosa wanted to buy a portion of the land to build a waste 
water treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Peltason had proposed a joint-use project leaving 859 acres untouched for 
research. But the regents voted to sell all the land in a sealed bid, which 
could bring $5.3 million to $6.3 million for the system. The regents said the 
money would go into an endowment for student financial aid.

WILSON PRESSES CASE FOR FEDERAL AID; FINANCE: GOVERNOR SAYS TAXES PAID BY 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD NOT BE COUNTED TO OFFSET THE REIMBURSEMENT HE SEEKS. 
HOUSE BILL WOULD HELP STATES WITH PRISON COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson said Friday that state taxes paid by illegal immigrants 
should not be counted to offset any portion of aid Congress provides to 
reimburse California for delivering federally required services to undocumented 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is pressing Congress to reimburse California $2.5 billion for the cost 
of providing education and health services and imprisoning illegal immigrants. 
His lobbying efforts received a major boost Friday when the House Judiciary 
Committee submitted an omnibus crime bill that includes language to reimburse 
states for the prison costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has argued that the federal government should count 
revenues generated by illegal immigrants through sales, property and income 
taxes to offset some of the costs of delivering services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I reject that," Wilson told reporters in an interview. "It is a specious 
argument." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson suggested that the vast majority of illegal immigrants who receive 
government services are indigent and do not pay a huge amount of taxes to the 
state. Many illegal residents, he said, receive money "under the table" that is 
not subject to withholding taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics accused Wilson of engaging in "immigrant bashing" by refusing to 
acknowledge the contributions of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reasons, the variable of receipts is something the governor 
always leaves out of the equation," said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles). 
"It is intellectually dishonest, it's unfair. That's why many of us think this 
is nothing more than a very hot political issue. It is scary, but it sells." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has hired the Urban Institute, a Washington think 
tank, to determine the cost of services delivered to illegal immigrants and the 
amount of tax revenues they generate. Budget Director Leon E. Panetta said 
Thursday that states should calculate the revenues received from illegal 
immigrants before submitting a bill to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one state, Texas, has issued a study concluding that illegal 
immigrants make a substantial contribution in taxes. In a recent study, Los 
Angeles County researchers found that undocumented residents paid $336 million 
in sales and property taxes, vehicle fees and lottery tickets during the 
1991-92 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Judiciary Committee's decision to include reimbursement for prison costs 
came as Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) persuaded committee Chairman 
Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) to insert the language. Berman had failed to get a 
similar provision in the bill at the subcommittee level. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be significant resources coming to the states," Berman said. "This 
is a major hurdle we've overcome. . . . California will be the single biggest 
beneficiary of this." 
</P>
<P>
 The provision still faces congressional hurdles. If approved by the full 
House, the legislation would go to a conference committee where House and 
Senate negotiators would try to reconcile differences between the crime bills 
passed by each chamber. The Senate bill does not include reimbursement for 
prison costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration estimates that it will cost California $403 million 
to imprison more than 18,000 illegal immigrant felons in fiscal year 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Imprisonment costs make up only a small chunk of the overall reimbursement 
package that Wilson is seeking from the federal government for providing 
services to undocumented residents, who number an estimated 2 million in 
California. His $2.5-billion request includes $1.7 billion to educate 392,260 
school-age illegal immigrant children and $400 million to provide emergency and 
pregnancy-related medical care to 390,000 illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's numbers have come under attack by the Clinton Administration and 
Democrats in the California congressional delegation, led by Sen. Barbara 
Boxer. One California Democratic aide said: "I don't know of any Democrat who 
is saying the ($2.5) billion is a correct figure." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Wilson met in a closed-door session for 30 minutes to discuss 
immigration funding strategy with four members of the House Appropriations 
Committee -- Democrats Vic Fazio of West Sacramento and Nancy Pelosi of San 
Francisco and Republicans Jerry Lewis of Redlands and Ron Packard of Oceanside.

PRIEST CLEARED OF EMBEZZLING FROM PARISH; COURTS: JURORS DEADLOCK ON CHARGE 
THAT FATHER DAVID PIROLI STOLE $50,000 FROM A SECOND CHURCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley priest was acquitted Friday of embezzling collection money from 
his former parish in Ventura, and a mistrial was declared after jurors 
deadlocked in his favor on a charge of stealing more than $50,000 from another 
parish. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdicts ended the six-week trial of Father David Dean Piroli, 37, whose 
defense was built on the assertion that a senior pastor framed him by planting 
thousands in cash in his church car and in his rooms at St. Peter Claver Church 
in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors, who voted 9 to 3 to acquit Piroli on that charge, said they did 
not necessarily believe Piroli was set up by Father James McKeon but had too 
many questions about the origin of the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah!" shouted defense attorney Richard Beada as he and Piroli walked smiling 
from the courtroom and into the arms of parishioners who remained loyal to the 
priest during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli and Beada said little because of a gag order imposed by Superior Court 
Judge Allan L. Steele that will stay in effect until attorneys meet again April 
8 to discuss retrying the priest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Piroli rolled his eyes, telling reporters, "You know I'm not sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace, who had failed to convince jurors that Piroli 
skimmed money from the collection plate to feed a cocaine habit and to buy 
gifts for a young Mexican man, did not comment either. 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese announced that it accepts the verdict acquitting Piroli of 
stealing money from Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy, but it regrets that the 
jury deadlocked on the alleged thefts from St. Peter Claver. 
</P>
<P>
 "This prolongs what has been a painful episode for the entire Catholic 
community," said Father Gregory Coiro, an archdiocesan spokesman, in a written 
statement. He repeated the archdiocese's stance condemning the accusations 
against McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to comment on Piroli's charges, McKeon said Friday: "Father Gregory took 
care of it." 
</P>
<P>
 David Patrick Callahan, an attorney for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles in the Piroli case, said no one but the jury thought the defense's 
theory of a conspiracy by McKeon "had a chance in hell of succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
 "My way of thinking was, he had scoped out St. Peter Claver Church and figured 
this was an easy place to scam," Callahan said. "And he did it apparently quite 
well -- $60,000 in cash is quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hamm, deacon of St. Peter Claver, said Piroli should be retried for 
stealing the money. "I feel he's guilty," Hamm said. "It was all 
circumstantial, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking a vote, jurors plowed through their notes on every witness and 
each piece of evidence, said Randy McDonald, a Newbury Park juror who voted to 
acquit the priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasonable doubt pushed them toward acquittal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said the case against Piroli might have been stronger if St. Peter 
Claver employees had not moved the cash from Piroli's room to church offices 
and then to a parishioner's home after finding it -- and if they had not waited 
11 days to report the alleged theft to police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, it seemed like a lot of people had their hands in the till," 
said McDonald. "A lot of us feel the Catholic Church has to look at how it does 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 A female juror, who asked not to be identified, added: "It was hard to follow 
the money."

BETTER RETAIN PERRY MASON; REGENTS WANT TO GET UCLA OUT OF THAT MILKEN DEAL -- 
GOOD LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Milken was called the junk bond king for good reason. The convicted 
felon is a shrewd operator. He certainly cleaned UCLA's clock when he entered 
into a now-controversial contract with the university that has caused the 
regents of the University of California deep embarrassment. So much so that the 
regents rightly have told UCLA to look for a way out of the contract -- however 
unlikely that possibility is. 
</P>
<P>
 Milken did too good a job in crafting a deal with UCLA to market videotapes of 
his past lectures at the Westwood campus. The contract allows him to keep 95% 
of the profits from the sale of videotapes. Further, the contract even waives 
UCLA's right to rescind the agreement or file an injunction against Milken. 
That apparently puts UCLA in the uncomfortable position of having to ask Milken 
if he would (pretty please) amend the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 People now wish to prevail upon him to set aside his business instincts and 
consider the priceless reputation of the UC system. For the controversy is not 
simply about money, which certainly Milken doesn't need and, regrettably, UCLA 
does. It extends beyond that to the lack of a comprehensive UC policy for 
commercializing of university lectures beyond the campus.  
</P>
<P>
 Certainly UCLA officials who signed the contract last fall on behalf of the 
regents should have protected the university's interests with acuity greater 
than that of first-year law school students. It might have been difficult to 
hang tough when Milken and his family made a $3.3-million contribution to UCLA 
shortly before the deal was finalized. But UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young, 
who is less than enthusiastic in approaching Milken now, is being asked to go 
to Milken, hat in hand, for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Milken served himself well in the UCLA contract; no one faults him for that. 
At the risk of sounding naive, we think Milken has a chance here to look beyond 
self-interest and pursue the greater good. Milken has an opportunity to give 
UCLA a break. He should do so.

TAX WATCH; RETRO WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What time is it? Well, by one measurement it's 1040, or 1040EZ for those with 
the simpler tax form. But if the April 15 deadline is clear, the certainty of 
allowable deductions is not.The federal government is arguing that Congress can 
change the rules in the middle of the game. That is unfair and bad policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court two weeks ago asked a number of common-sense questions 
that led observers to think the justices believe the government has it wrong in 
the case of U.S. vs. Carlton, and perhaps on the whole issue of tax 
retroactivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Carlton, a Newport Beach tax lawyer, filed a tax return in 1986 for the 
estate of an oil heiress, taking advantage of a tax law change made that year. 
The next year, Congress retroactively repealed the deduction involved and the 
Internal Revenue Service billed the estate, which wound up losing $630,000. A 
federal appeals court backed Carlton; the government took the case to the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department lawyer argued that taxpayers should be prepared for 
retroactive changes, and, besides, the 1986 provision allowing the deduction 
"was too good to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 That's preposterous. We need some degree of certainty in all laws, including 
the tax code, even though the Supreme Court has long interpreted the 
Constitution's ban on retroactive laws as applying to criminal laws, not civil. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers do agree that when the court does rule, it will not tamper with last 
summer's tax hikes, retroactive to the previous January. We all have to pay 
that bill next month.

MICHAEL MORIARTY ON TV VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Michael Moriarty presented a dramatic, if not logical, argument against 
censorship of television violence (interview, Opinion, March 6). In the same 
edition, Cal State researchers reported that "children who watch 'Mighty 
Morphin Power Rangers' can be dangerous to other children's health." 
</P>
<P>
 He presents an emotionally charged argument defending television violence. He 
says those in the government who want to censor violence have "sick attitudes" 
and are "liberal fascists." 
</P>
<P>
 Moriarty asks if we want a government that treats the nation as if we were 
children. No, but I appreciate the government looking to protect children from 
an excess of violence being modeled for them on TV. Children lack the skills to 
mediate the violence they see on TV against the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people being killed by guns is on the rise in this country. This 
increase in aggressive behavior is not happening by accident. Moriarty needs to 
stop acting and start thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM MALE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The interview with Moriarty should be required reading for finger-pointing, 
whining religious groups attacking TV programs, framed and sent to all 
transient politicians in Washington and reprinted in enough quantity to 
wallpaper Atty. Gen. Janet Reno's home. I am angered and disgusted that we have 
become a country allowing this or that bleeding-heart group to continue to 
blame "outside forces" for all the social problems that suffocate our nation 
currently. One wonders if Reno and her gang offended anyone with their deadly 
assault in Waco, wherein dozens of people were slaughtered? And, that 
production was without any special effects. Unlike an action show of violence 
seen sometimes on TV, the attacked did not walk away -- and never will.  
</P>
<P>
 The tsunami of censorship mentality prevailing now in America -- if carried to 
its fullest potential -- could (and can) do away with just about everything. 
Along with banning smoking, firearms, ethnic jokes, helmet-free bicycle or 
motorcycle riding, fluid-less outdoor barbecue cooking, firecrackers on the 4th 
of July, curfew-free beaches at night and all the other insanities of lost 
freedoms shoved in our faces, it is time to stop the madness. 
</P>
<P>
 MAX ST. YVES 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * So Moriarty has had enough of being a liberal! One issue and he throws in 
the towel. What conviction! 
</P>
<P>
 Where was the righteous Moriarty when the visual arts were taking a pasting by 
members of Congress who wanted to censor the artists' right to freedom of 
expression? Or is it a case of whose ox is gored? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course we have always had violence in drama. But the Greeks and Shakespeare 
did it with more class than "Law and Order." 
</P>
<P>
 Moriarty is a superb actor. He should get off his personal soapbox defending 
violence on television and worrying about censorship of said violence and stay 
on the stage and screen where his talents are fully appreciated. Please, Mr. 
Moriarty, don't make Janet Reno a personal vendetta.

TRAVEL ADVISORY -- WHEN IN ROME . . .; SINGAPORE FLOGGING CASE: OBEY FOREIGN 
LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Honesty check: Who among us can truly say that he or she did not, if only for 
a fleeting moment, respond with approval to the news that a Singapore court had 
sentenced an American teen-ager to be flogged for vandalism? 
</P>
<P>
 Our informal survey suggests that this was probably the immediate reaction of 
most urban dwellers, who have had it up to here with graffiti and other 
community-blighting hooliganism. Finally, many must surely have thought, the 
punishment was being made to fit the crime. Except, as calmer reflection must 
make clear, the punishment in this case is obviously and grotesquely 
disproportionate to the deed. 
</P>
<P>
 Deliberately inflicting excruciating pain and lifetime scarring on a 
lawbreaker's body may or may not deter others from committing crimes. 
Certainly, though, it represents a regression from the values that our 
civilization for hundreds of years has struggled to establish as matters of 
human right. Yes, this is happening in a small country far across the Pacific 
with its own laws and culture. It is happening to a young American whose 
behavior was stupid, irresponsible, arrogant and insulting to the host country. 
That is a fact. It's no less a fact that the punishment that has been ordered 
is brutally excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Peter Fay, 18, spray-painted cars on a Singapore street and committed 
other acts of hooliganism. The mandatory sentence for such activities is six 
strokes across the bare buttocks with a wet rattan cane. The blows are 
delivered by a martial arts expert. They are meant to wound, and they do. Fay 
has also been sentenced to four months in jail and fined $2,200. He is now 
appealing his sentence while out on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interests of good relations Singapore should not insist on corporal 
punishment for Fay. In the interests of their own well-being, Americans who 
travel should understand that their own country's constitutional protections 
don't accompany them abroad. Violate local law in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan 
and other countries and a flogging could result. Violate anti-drug laws in some 
countries -- Malaysia, for one -- and hanging can follow. Law-abiding travelers 
don't have to be too concerned. Others had better beware. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Fay should have been aware; Singapore makes no secret of its laws. But 
the effect of Fay's crime also ought to be weighed. No permanent damage was 
done, restitution was made. Surely Singapore would not be demeaning itself by 
showing some flexibility in this case.

FEINSTEIN'S DESERT PROTECTION BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * What a relief to read your editorial "Troubled Journey for Desert 
Protection" (March 6). Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) is doing an 
honorable service to the people of California and the world. Not only does she 
have the vision to make our cities safer by supporting assault weapons 
legislation, she also recognizes the need to provide the people of California 
safe places to take our families for rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments to diminish this legislation are demeaning. Why not protect 
significant natural resources from degradation and destructive uses? National 
parks are still America's favorite place to take families on vacation. The 
people who like to ride motorcycles and shoot guns ruin the wilderness 
experience for the rest of us. Let them have their off-road vehicle parks and 
hunting preserves and let the rest of us have a safe haven to take our 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 JAN LAUDISE 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 * Yes, desert protection will suffer -- if this bill passes and flocks of 
tourists roam over it under National Park Service management. Tourist 
facilities will be built and tour buses will race over the area, probably on 
improved roads. New sites will be provided for campers to trample and litter 
with trash. 
</P>
<P>
 You lament Feinstein's amendment to the bill for the deletion of 290,000 acres 
of land from the proposed park which contain "historical sites, Native American 
petroglyphs, and pristine habitat. . . ." Thanks for the compliment. Most of 
the land in question is privately owned. It is not pristine, but it is 
obviously in good condition. I own some of that land. It's not for sale, and 
acquisition by condemnation will spell political suicide to those who instigate 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you lament the effects of amendments that would downgrade some parcels to 
a national hunting preserve, "permitting hunting and tourism." I don't allow 
hunting on my land, so I'm protecting it better now than the National Park 
Service would. And tourism is what supporters of the bill say will make up for 
the economic loss of terminating mining and grazing in the area. It won't, of 
course.

ARMENIA'S BID FOR U.S. AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I cannot help but respond to the article by Raffi K. Hovannisian 
(Commentary, Feb. 25), arguing that Washington has not given sufficient 
consideration to the needs of Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia might find more sympathy in the United States and the world if it were 
not engaged in a war of aggression against Azerbaijan -- a war in which 
Armenian forces have occupied 25% of my country, looted and burned hundreds of 
villages, created a million refugees, killed more than 16,000 and wounded 
another 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When you take actions like that, you should not expect sympathy or support. 
The current Armenian government is now supporting: 
</P>
<P>
 * A war of aggression for territory, in violation of all international norms 
of behavior. Armenia is seeking through force of arms to create a Greater 
Armenia. I believe this action is the result of a small group of 
ultranationalists, not the Armenian people as a whole, with whom Azerbaijanis 
have lived and worked for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 * The premise that borders and territorial sovereignty can be violated through 
force, again in violation of international law and contrary to the principles 
upheld by the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe and every major world power. What Armenian forces are attempting is no 
different from the Iraqi attempt to conquer Kuwait through force. 
</P>
<P>
 * A series of Armenian offensives that have made one in every seven citizens 
of Azerbaijan a refugee. On top of that, the Armenian government's American 
lobby persuaded Congress to enact a ban on direct aid -- even for refugees -- 
in Azerbaijan. Armenians are indeed suffering terribly because of their 
government's actions, but nothing in comparison to the tens of thousands of 
innocent Azerbaijanis who lost their homes and are now living out the winter in 
open camps beside the roads.  
</P>
<P>
 So, please, Mr. Hovannisian, spare us the crocodile tears. When Armenia starts 
acting like other civilized countries it will gain more sympathy throughout the 
world.

BIKE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Bravo to Mike Clary for his informative piece on Daytona Bike Week! I longed 
for the day The Times would print a truthful, balanced article about 
motorcyclists, instead of the usual media stereotyping. Clary noted that 99% of 
motorcyclists are fun-loving, upstanding citizens.That Bike Week is Daytona's 
"biggest, best-behaved" and richest event should send a message to Southern 
California governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bike week will gross Daytona merchants $211 million in one week. That ain't 
chump change, folks! With our local economies, and particularly tourism, in the 
dumps, perhaps we should reconsider our attitudes toward motorcyclists and 
motor racing in general. After all, we have weather year-round that Daytona 
gets only in winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California is also home to the largest group of off-road riders in 
the nation. Every weekend, thousands of us take our families to the Mojave 
Desert to enjoy our sport in a lawful, responsible and economically stimulating 
manner. If local government leaders continue to stand by idly while the Sierra 
Club's desert closure bill sails through an uninformed Congress, they can kiss 
our money goodby.

OFFSHORE O.C. AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Osaka International Airport opens sometime this year. It was developed through 
a consortium of government, technical, industry and business interests.Why is 
it unique? It was built five miles offshore . 
</P>
<P>
 We can do better. Our oil platforms have shown outstanding stability offshore. 
Orange County and nearby areas have the best technical people and know-how in 
the world. We could end the bickering concerning land overflights and aviation 
noise -- there would be none. Closed military bases could be utilized for the 
needed projects of low-cost housing, facilities for the homeless, and penal 
correctional facilities at little or no cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to move into the 21st Century to offshore airport technology.

CBS'S NCAA COVERAGE LEAVES THIS FAN COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it just me, or is there something radically wrong at CBS Sports? Who was 
the wise guy who decided not to dedicate more air time to the NCAA Men's 
Basketball Tournament? Do the "execs" in New York plan to rest on their Winter 
Olympic laurels for the rest of the year? I certainly hope not, because if 
Thursday's coverage of the tourney was any indication -- college hoop fans are 
in for a long three weeks! 
</P>
<P>
 I can't understand why CBS decided to scrap the last game of the afternoon 
(the best game of the afternoon!) Not airing Cal vs. Wisconsin Green Bay was a 
classic sports TV blunder! CBS had the opportunity to showcase the best guard 
in college basketball (Jason Kidd) since Magic was a pup, and they dropped the 
ball! The least they could have done was broadcast it for the people in 
California and Wisconsin.

ANOTHER LOOK AT THE WINNER'S CIRCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was one of the members of the Hersh party ushered from the winner's circle 
on March 5 after the Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents, Phillip and Sophie Hersh, had just been told that our horse, The 
Wicked North, had been disqualified and were all shocked and very upset by the 
stewards' decision.My mother is 75 with a breathing disorder, and my father is 
also 75 with a heart condition. My husband and I were concerned about their 
well-being, and I was trying to gather our party and get them out of the 
winner's circle when a group of men loudly asked an attendant to "get those 
people out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 The attendant very rudely demanded we leave. This all took place within 
seconds of The Wicked North's number being taken down. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is true that the Paulson party did not come down immediately after 
the race, the stewards' inquiry lasted more than 10 minutes, which afforded the 
party time to reach the winner's circle. The rudeness occurred seconds after 
learning of the disqualification.

 I am continually amazed when quality writers like Thomas Bonk and Gene 
Wojciechowski automatically assume that every UCLA fan who dares to criticize 
Jim Harrick lives in a fantasyland where anything less than a perfect season 
and a national championship is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, sincere UCLA fans can accept that the Wooden era is over, 
that there is parity in college basketball, that it is difficult to win on the 
road against a quality opponent and that Jim Harrick is a swell guy who 
graduates most of his athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 We would be more satisfied if UCLA consistently put forth the kind of effort 
it did against an excellent Louisville team. 
</P>
<P>
 What we can't, and won't, accept is a UCLA team that doesn't get back on 
defense, doesn't rebound, seems confused in the half-court offense and often 
plays without emotion or intensity. And we certainly can't accept a team that 
seems to play its best ball in December against easier opponents and its worst 
ball in March against tougher opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 We will continue to demand excellence from UCLA's basketball teams because of 
their history and tradition. Yes, we know there will never be another John 
Wooden, but it doesn't mean we have to settle for a Jim Harrick.

SUPPORT COMES FROM MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reporter Eric Shepard needs to curb his bias in attacking and condemning Mater 
Dei head basketball Coach Gary McKnight. Shepard wrote two articles within this 
week which used prep basketball to forward his personal agenda.He then 
selectively carved up my responses to his related phone call to support his 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 I was not close enough to the court until the final three minutes to validate 
any of this reporter's observations. Who is he to tell Gary McKnight to move 
out of coaching? He does not know the man. 
</P>
<P>
 I support Gary McKnight's concerns with the quality of refereeing in the 
Crenshaw-Mater Dei game. How embarrassing to the CIF and to the ref himself to 
read in The Times the next day that Kris Johnson admitted that two occasions of 
play-acting duped a referee, created a four-point turnaround in the final 1:20 
and contributed mightily to the 71-67 victory by a fine Crenshaw team. 
</P>
<P>
 I support Gary McKnight; if that support ever calls for a principal's 
guidance, Gary is always man enough to listen and to grow. 
</P>

 Mr. Shepard's article "This Coach Needs to Curb His Temper" was not worth the 
paper and ink it took to print it, and The Times should be more responsible 
than to publish an article that was obviously written for no other reason than 
to attack and hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary McKnight is a dedicated, well respected member of the Mater Dei family, 
and the boys who have passed through his basketball program have been the lucky 
recipients of his energy and knowledge.

END OF THE LINE FOR TONYA HARDING?

 The punishment for Tonya Harding hardly fits the crime, and the Portland 
district attorney should be ashamed of himself.

 As I'm sure we all strongly suspected, Tonya Harding admitted that she 
obstructed justice in the assault on Nancy Kerrigan, and I'm sure she played an 
integral part in planning the attack.

 Now can we all put this ludicrous fascination about the evil-doer behind us?

KERRIGAN'S COMMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Greg Braxton's "Skategate: And Now the Movies" (March 3), he refers to 
Nancy Kerrigan's derogatory comments while making a Disney World appearance as 
aired on NBC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw the NBC report that outlined Kerrigan's attitude toward the press and, 
seemingly , the Disney appearance where the microphones caught her sorry cracks 
to Mickey Mouse, who rode in the parade car with her. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read in The Times' Sports section that Kerrigan denied she meant 
criticism of Disney World and was referring to her mother's "order" that she 
wear her silver medal, I thought Kerrigan was covering up to retain her 
lucrative Disney contract. However, on ABC News, I saw tape of Kerrigan riding 
with Mickey that showed a totally different version of her comments that proved 
her case: Her unhappiness was over wearing the Olympic medal, which she 
considered "bragging." 
</P>
<P>
 The person at NBC who inserted the derogatory bias against Kerrigan deserves 
to be fired.

GENOCIDE IS EVERYWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why does Steven Spielberg say that the movie "Schindler's List" was his "duty 
to make" ("Spielberg's 'List' a Call to 'Duty,' " March 7)? Does he realize the 
saturation level of the Jewish Holocaust in the media and elsewhere, the 
Holocaust Museum in L.A., the Holocaust Memorial in Washington, schoolchildren 
being taught about the Holocaust, plus other stories about it in the press and 
on television? This genocide of the Jews has been shoved into our faces ad 
nauseam. 
</P>
<P>
 What is sadly lacking is a similar telling of other equally horrifying 
genocides -- the Armenian genocide, the starvation genocide of the Ukranians by 
the former Soviet Union, the genocide of the Cambodians. 
</P>
<P>
 Genocide is everywhere, and the spotlight should not be focused on the Jews 
alone. They have made their case. It is now the "duty" of Spielberg or other 
filmmakers to focus on the genocides of other similarly long-suffering ethnic 
peoples.

IT'S DISRUPTIVE TO HAVE ADS BEFORE MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Cable Trailers on Big Screen Drawing Fire" (March 5), I have news 
for Showtime Senior Vice President of Marketing Mark Greenburg (the only 
individual quoted who mentioned the "moviegoing audience"): What you are doing 
is deleterious to the experience of a regular patron. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps people who only venture into theaters to see blockbusters, having been 
sucked in by hype and advertising to begin with, don't mind the constant 
seat-jostling and talking that goes on for the first 10 to 20 minutes after the 
house lights go down.Maybe they enjoy that aspect of the communal experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But others who attend movies on a weekly basis are so tired of late-arriving 
patrons, of thinking that we're seated in an ideal location only to have our 
sight line obliterated as the opening scenes of the film roll by, of the 
wayward person looking for his/her group by roaming the aisles shouting their 
names, of the inability of people coming into a darkened house to see and 
audibly complaining as if they expected a tunnel of light to guide them, of the 
lack of ushers or other personnel to quell these moments. 
</P>
<P>
 What is happening is the forced change from arriving at or before show time 
into a gradual creeping into the blackened theater, lips sealed, within a 
perfectly timed millisecond of the start of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to the movies should not have to require combat training -- that is, the 
plotting and scheming and timing involved in avoiding all that comes before a 
film (including Los Angeles Times commercials). And it's all a shame because we 
really used to enjoy the trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose that is what we have E! for now.

TV WITHOUT KURALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In these days when local TV news reporters are paid hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to cover stories that any cub police reporter could handle at one-tenth 
the pay, the announcement of Charles Kuralt's retirement is a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 A literate, thoughtful reporter, he endows stories with perspective, balance 
and absence of malice. He lets the story tell itself without hype, misdirected 
emphasis or distortion. And he obviously likes people. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little hope of finding others like him. If there are future Kuralts 
in the hinterlands, today's ratings-obsessed news directors will cut them off 
at the knees. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kuralt's departure, there is no reason to watch TV news.

 Shot on videotape in a simulated verite style, the art-house matinee feature 
"The Lost Words" is about "modern love and how we 'have to say the words,' even 
if we don't quite know what they are" (according to the literature). 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, these characters are never at a loss for words. 
Inarticulateness seems to be the least of their problems: As if to fulfill your 
worst stereotypes about New York neurotics, everyone here whines incessantly. 
As an Angeleno, it makes you feel suddenly not so self-involved after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The misguided conceit is that Charles (Michael Kaniecki) -- an unemployed 
video editor and folk singer-songwriter with a really terrible haircut -- has 
hired a buddy to shoot his daily life on a camcorder in the hopes that it will 
revitalize him and save his failing relationship with Marcie (Zelda Gergel). 
We're not supposed to worry about why he thinks this might work, or how all the 
cross-cutting close-ups in real time are achieved with a single camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Each scene is presented as a separate vignette with its own title card, 
circumventing any need for continuity. Some of the actors in smaller roles, 
playing sexist-pig men or ditsy-artist women, fare fine doing improv riffing. 
Charles, though, is so ineffectual -- like Woody Allen on a 'lude bender, with 
about 85 IQ points lopped off for bad behavior -- that he's incapable of 
arousing our sympathy, and a viewer might actually spend most of the movie 
supposing it's an ironic indictment of him. Or that the video-making context is 
meant to be a spoof of the masturbatory nature of self-documentation, a la 
Albert Brooks' "Real Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong, pastrami-breath. If they ever hold an "I Hate New York" film festival 
here, "The Lost Words" might suffice as a midnight feature.

MUSIC REVIEW; YO-YO MA IN SOLO RECITAL AT WADSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In successful attempts to broaden the cello repertory, Yo-Yo Ma regularly 
raids the cupboards of other solo instruments. Returning under the auspices of 
UCLA's Center for the Performing Arts Wednesday night, the Paris-born musician 
did it again. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he stole from violinists, three of the famous and familiar Caprices 
by Paganini (Nos. 9, 11 and 24), playing them with such effortless articulation 
that one heard the music, not the difficulties. Still, his sold-out audience in 
Wadsworth Theater in Westwood greeted the feat with noisy approbation. In doing 
so, they were not misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other novelties on Ma's unaccompanied solo program, though its core 
became, through a last-minute reconstituting of the agenda, two Bach suites. 
</P>
<P>
 George Crumb's wondrous, still ear-opening, positively abrasive Sonata for 
Solo Cello (1955) began the program in a crush of projected emotion, making all 
its many points in a wide-ranging dynamic scheme -- from ghostly pianissimos to 
the sturdiest of fortes -- and holding the listener, as it were, by the collar. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, there was David Wilde's "The Cellist of Sarajevo" (1992), a poignant 
and wrenching eight-minute "Lament in Rondo Form," and a relic of the Bosnian 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid these important but mundane musical expressions, Bach provided the 
comforts of timeless beauty and abstraction. The Suite No 1. in G offered aural 
rewards for the next, more spiritual, world, while the Suite No. 6 in D 
balanced joyful virtuosity with seraphic visions. Ma played both with the 
deepest concentration and in apparently direct communication with his rapt 
listeners. No wonder they flock to his every visit here.

ART REVIEW; SEAN LANDERS: A 'BAD BOY' GOES BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sean Landers belongs to the second generation of "bad boy"/"just pathetic" 
artists. His predecessors -- Mike Kelley, Jim Shaw, Cary Leibowitz, et al. -- 
got in their licks before the ranks began to swell. Now, there's more 
competition -- and Landers doesn't handle it well. 
</P>
<P>
 Things begin to go wrong when he adopts a strategy that already seems hoary 
with age, and then shifts into overdrive, aiming for a pathos so overwhelming 
it is transgressive. Yet to paraphrase Marx, history plays the first time as 
tragedy, the second time as farce. At least tragedy can boast a certain 
integrity; the same is difficult to say of Landers. 
</P>
<P>
 His show at Regen Projects is structured around two enormous "word" paintings 
-- massive canvases covered in the artist's characteristically whiny, 
autobiographical prose. It is virtually -- and purposely -- impossible to get 
through the text, especially when Landers notes, in the first few lines of one 
of the paintings, that if you read too much, you will inherit his "nerosise" 
(sic). The other painting informs us of his crises of the day, how much his art 
"sucks" and what a failure his color stripe paintings are. 
</P>
<P>
 To the right of this latter painting is, of course, a color stripe painting, 
in which the horizontal bands of red, green and blue are shaky and irregular. 
If Landers' "confessions" are made tongue-in-cheek, we are being directed to 
admire this painting; if they are not, we are directed to empathize with him. 
It doesn't really matter since the painting is neither so good nor so awful 
that it commands attention. Like Landers' work on the whole, it leaves us 
indifferent, making him neither a "bad boy," nor "pathetic," but just possibly, 
in the wrong business. 
</P>

TV REVIEWS; ONE LOOK TOO MANY OF 'ULTIMATE BETRAYAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blood on the bathroom wall, vomiting, terrified children being sexually and 
physically abused by their sadistic father, traumatized adults picking up the 
pieces of their shattered lives. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimate Betrayal," CBS' true-to-life Sunday movie starring Marlo Thomas, Mel 
Harris, Ally Sheedy and Kathryn Dowling, is an ugly, intense film, based on a 
landmark legal case in which two sisters successfully sued their father for 
sexual and physical abuse, decades after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 That suit led to the Child Abuse Accountability Act of 1993, now pending in 
Congress, which would allow victims to claim the abusive parent's retirement 
annuity or pension. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, directed by Donald Wrye and written by Gregory Goodell, Thomas 
plays Sharon, who, with her sister Susan (Harris), decides to pursue a legal 
suit for damages against her abusive father (Henry Czerny) -- an ex-FBI agent 
and child-abuse expert -- for the incest and physical injury she and her five 
siblings suffered growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Each sister has her close-up moments of emotional torment, revelation and 
flashback narration, while the trial serves as a healing catharsis -- 
particularly for Sharon, the only one who had repressed memories of her abuse. 
(Eileen Heckart plays her supportive, inner-child-seeking therapist.) 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting actors have a thin existence as satellites to the stars, but 
Thomas, Harris and Sheedy in particular convey the fragility of adult victims 
haunted by the specters of their pasts. Thomas' intensity and Harris' quiet 
constraint are especially effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact is diminished, ironically, by graphic flashbacks using child 
actors. Too frequent not to seem gratuitous, the scenes contain little that 
can't be seen in the expressive faces of the adult leads. Then, too, 
familiarity lessens shock and outrage, and this tele- genre is becoming so 
ubiquitous that you can be forgiven if you grow numb under the barrage. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ultimate Betrayal" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). LYNNE

TV REVIEWS; 'THE BIRDS II' IS NO HITCHCOCK CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Birds II: Land's End" is pretty much for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a routine reworking rather than a sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 
classic "The Birds."The film is decently, though unexcitingly acted and has 
good special effects, but it lacks suspense and tension, crucial for a story so 
well-known to so many viewers in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, the new film plays up the ecological implications of the birds' 
malevolent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Johnson and Chelsea Field play a young couple with two small daughters 
(Stephanie Milford, Megan Gallagher) who have rented for the summer a 
ramshackle house on an East Coast island. She has put behind her, as much as 
possible, the loss of her son in a car accident five years earlier, but Johnson 
remains paralyzed with grief. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral of the story, written by Ken & Jim Wheat and Robert Eisele, is that 
there's nothing like a massive attack of killer birds to bring a troubled 
couple back together.  
</P>
<P>
 The star of the original "Birds," Tippi Hedren, looking much as she did three 
decades ago, plays the proprietor of the local general store. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Birds II: Land's End" airs at 9 p.m. Sunday on Showtime. It will be 
followed at 10:30 by the original "The Birds," which in turn will be followed 
by "Inside the Birds," a 15-minute documentary about the making of the two 
movies. KEVIN THOMAS

TV REVIEWS; THE REAL-LIFE ENIGMA OF OSKAR SCHINDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Filmmaker Jon Blair, whose 10-year-old British documentary about Oskar 
Schindler airs tonight just before those other Oscars, has recently fretted on 
the record that he never "cracked" the Schindler enigma. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt it was a weakness in my film that I couldn't explain 
Schindler's motivation," Blair said about the man who rescued 1,100 Jews from 
the Nazi ovens, "and ("Schindler's List" director Steven) Spielberg told me the 
same about his. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair -- and Spielberg -- needn't fret. That very enigma is what lends Blair's 
90-minute "Schindler" -- and "Schindler's List" -- the quality of art. And art, 
as Alain Resnais powerfully demonstrated in his documentary about the Nazi 
concentration camps, "Night and Fog," is not off-limits to factual reports of 
the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 As in "Schindler's List," the salesman-turned-Nazi spy-turned-industrialist 
emerges as a human prism, perceived as the perceiver wishes him to be. Thus, 
Ruth Kalder, the emphysema-sticken mistress of Plaszow camp commandant Amon 
Goeth, defends her reputedly sadistic lover by denying that Schindler "loved 
Jews." Kalder may have known a side to the man he didn't show others. Yet only 
she and Joachim Kinstlinger, a member of Schindler's list of Jews sheltered in 
his munitions factory, say on camera that Schindler was an opportunist. 
</P>
<P>
 From another side of the Schindler prism, he was an angel of mercy. In the 
film's most dramatic sequence -- one severely truncated in Spielberg's version 
-- women survivors recall being transported to the Auschwitz death camp after 
having worked under Schindler's protection. They waited for months to see if 
their angel would arrive. He finally did, after being arrested himself. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Blair explicitly shows how Schindler made himself wealthy at 
the very moment of Germany's greatest desperation. He mastered the art of 
black-market trade, thought nothing of buying a luxury car, and easily bribed 
key officials with diamonds to buy his own protection from the SS. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even here, the enigma remains. At a certain point, Schindler allowed his 
humanity to overtake his good business sense: The list survivors recall how 
they were pathetically unskilled at producing usable weapons parts in 
Schindler's factory, and how their angel-boss had to buy quality parts on the 
black market to cover for his Jewish workers. 
</P>
<P>
 While Blair doesn't give us a glimpse of Schindler's loyal assistant, Stern, 
he includes a rich, postwar epilogue missing from "Schindler's List." There is 
Schindler's ironic and harrowing escape from the advancing victorious Soviet 
army (he was disguised as a camp survivor). There is his aimless life in 
Argentina and Germany (he appears alone and lost in the Frankfurt streets in a 
film clip shot in the '60s). Finally, there are the tributes in Israel. 
Schindler loved a party, and the guardian angel got one from people who never 
puzzled over niceties like "motivation." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Schindler" airs at 8 tonight on KCOP-TV Channel 13.

GETTING FURNITURE IN RIGHT PLACE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some ideas to keep in mind as you rearrange furniture in your home: 
</P>
<P>
 * To encourage conversation, arrange seating in groups so pieces are no more 
than eight feet apart. Set the coffee table about 18 inches from the sofa to 
improve access and make room for knees. Ideally, the coffee table should be the 
same height as the seat cushions. 
</P>
<P>
 * A good location for the TV set is out of the line of traffic, in a wall unit 
against the wall opposite the main seating area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid crowding walkways. Allow at least 30 inches for passageways and 36 
inches of clear space in front of doorways and chests of drawers. If possible, 
allow at least 50 inches between the dining table and the nearest wall or piece 
of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 * For lighting, lamps generally should be tall enough so the bottom of the 
shade is 15 to 16 inches above the tabletop. A lampshade should be narrower 
than the lamp table. Opaque shades concentrate light and are a good choice for 
task lighting. Translucent shades diffuse light and may subtly make a room look 
bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Place the furniture to draw attention to a natural focal point, such as a 
fireplace or picture window. Large rooms may have more than one focal point; 
smaller areas can be created with furniture placement and area rugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the bedroom, position the bed first so it doesn't divide the room 
visually and is away from drafts. A good arrangement is to center the headboard 
against the longest wall. For easier bed making, leave at least 30 inches on 
each side. If you push a single bed lengthwise against the wall, put the bed on 
casters so you can swing it away from the wall to change sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Measure the room, then draw a floor plan to scale on graph paper (one square 
equals one foot). Draw furniture to scale, or better yet, cut out templates so 
you can move them around. They aren't nearly as heavy as the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>

Furniture Arranging: Arranging for Comfort," available from the Bombay Co., a

GARDENING; THE VINE ART OF HOME-GROWN TOMATOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gardeners of both the serious and casual variety have become adamant on the 
point: They want tomatoes that taste like tomatoes, and they want them now , 
say managers of area nurseries scrambling to respond to the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers are coming in for tomatoes earlier than ever this year, says Larry 
Amling, manager of Armstrong Garden Center in Newport Beach. And -- hoping to 
jump-start the season -- they are leaving with larger plants. For the first 
time in his experience, says Amling, one-gallon plants are outselling four-inch 
pots. The order of nearly 300 plants the nursery received in mid-February -- 
and had expected to last well into March -- disappeared in just 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristin Fusano, assistant manager at Roger's Gardens in Newport Beach, reports 
the same phenomenon. "People are really hungry for tomatoes," she says. "They 
can't wait to get started. One-gallon plants are flying out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 If you've ever tasted a home-grown, vine-ripened tomato, says Amling, you'll 
understand his customers' eagerness. And, if you haven't, he says, you should. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home-grown tomatoes will be a revelation. They're sweeter, richer, meatier 
textured, more aromatic and keep longer (up to two weeks without refrigeration) 
than store-bought tomatoes. There's really no comparison." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardeners want diversity in their tomato crop, too, so nurseries have begun 
carrying more varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buying a six-pack of one variety is becoming unusual," Amling says. 
"Customers are much more likely to buy one general purpose tomato, like 'Better 
Boy,' one cherry tomato like 'Sweet 100,' and one paste tomato, like 'Roma.' So 
we're carrying a lot more kinds." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger's Gardens will be carrying 20 different tomatoes this year, Fusano says. 
Along with proven-track-record classics such as 'Early Girl,' 'Ace' and 
'Beefmaster,' the nursery will add some new cultivars that Fusano tested in her 
own garden last year. 
</P>
<P>
 'Magaroku,' a rose-skinned, rose-fleshed, persimmon-shaped cultivar of 
Japanese origin, is the one she's most excited about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my favorite tomato last year," she says. "Very meaty, very sweet, very 
versatile and very disease-resistant -- a wonderful tomato." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that many gardeners have minuscule yards, nurseries have also 
added a lot more compact cultivars suitable for growing in containers on decks 
or patios. 'Wadda,' an Armstrong exclusive, is one example; 'Patio,' found at 
Roger's, is another. Some cultivars -- such as 'Tiny Treasures' at Armstrong -- 
are small enough for window boxes. Even hanging baskets can be put to work for 
cultivars such as 'Golden Currant.' 
</P>
<P>
 If you want still more variety, start from seed. Seed companies offer an 
astonishing range of choices this year. Tomato Growers Supply, for instance, 
lists 225 varieties, including many heirloom plants. 
</P>
<P>
 March is the ideal time for starting tomatoes from seed, according to Ralph 
Barton, a Fullerton resident and Fullerton Arboretum volunteer. Barton says he 
has been growing tomatoes in his home garden for at least 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to get fruit until summer no matter what size tomato plant 
you start with," he says. "So why not start from seed? It's cheaper; it's fun, 
and you get a lot more choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Though half the fun of growing tomatoes, Barton says, is experimenting with 
something new every year -- he grows at least 20 varieties per year -- there 
are a few he wouldn't be without. 
</P>
<P>
 They include: 
</P>
<P>
 * 'Brandywine' (a pinkish, beefsteak heirloom tomato), which he describes as 
one of Mother Nature's greatest inventions. "It's so big, a slice overlaps the 
bread when you're making a sandwich. And it's incredibly tasty." 
</P>
<P>
 * 'Arkansas Traveler,' another pink beefsteak. This Southern heirloom is noted 
for its ability to stand up to humidity, a definite asset the past few summers 
in Southern California, Barton says. ('Heatwave,' a recent Burpee introduction, 
also stands up to humidity well, according to other arboretum volunteers.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 'Gurney Girl,' (exclusive to Gurney Seed), an all-purpose tomato, is a heavy 
producer, very reliable and has a wonderful flavor, Barton says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 'Celebrity,' a 1984 All-American Selection winner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 'Yellow Pear,' and 'Yellow Currant' (a South American species tomato with 
tiny yellow fruit and a vine-like growth habit). "I plant it in eight-inch 
hanging baskets and snack from them every time I walk by," he says. "Kids like 
it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Last but not least, Barton says, is 'Dona.'  
</P>
<P>
 "It has an unusually long growing season," he says. "If you planted it last 
year, you'd still be harvesting tomatoes now." 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've become addicted to vine-ripened, flavor-laden, home-grown 
tomatoes, you'll understand why that's a virtue.

 Perhaps the most classic example of poorly placed furniture is the ottoman 
that Rob Petrie trips over in the opening of the old "Dick Van Dyke Show." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement of furniture in a room is probably the most important aspect 
of creating an inviting environment. But how do you create a functional setting 
and still have an exciting design that won't leave people stumbling? 
</P>
<P>
 The following are some tried-and-true rules of furniture arrangement, as well 
as tips from interior designers on creating a visually interesting room that 
meets the needs of its inhabitants. How Is the Room to Be Used? 
</P>
<P>
 This question needs to be answered before a stick of furniture is moved. Is 
the room going to be primarily for watching TV, an area for reading or a place 
to entertain guests? Or even a parlor where the main purpose is to showcase the 
furnishings? 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing I do is ask my clients what is important to them in their 
environment and how they function within the house," said Garry Sandlin, an 
interior designer based in Huntington Beach. "Some families with children want 
to block areas so kids just can't run right through the house, so we create 
barriers." 
</P>
<P>
 Other households may have members with limited mobility and need rooms that 
are barrier-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers say one of the most common mistakes in room arrangements is lining 
furniture up against the walls, as if it's needed to hold them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have a tendency to fill all the walls up with furniture and ignore the 
middle of the room," Sandlin said. "The middle of the room should be used to 
create an intimate area. In the majority of rooms you can float the furniture 
in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 An exception to this is a room that must accommodate small children. Few 
toddlers will be able to maneuver around a lot of furniture, and children need 
space to play in and still be where the family is gathered. In this instance, 
it may be better to push the furniture closer to the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 After there is a clear idea about the primary use of the room, it is time to 
stand back and figure out what needs changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask yourself what is it you have that you're unhappy about, said designer Bill 
Kiefer of Tustin. "Maybe it is as simple as rearranging the furniture you have, 
maybe taking an end table out and putting in a floor lamp from another room." 
Creating a Focal Point 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing the focal point of a room is the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a center to the room to give it weight. If you walk into a 
room with just groups of furniture but no real focal point, it ends up feeling 
like a hotel lobby: uninviting," said Ronald Sanchez of Sam-Pri Interiors in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Many designers say there should only be one focal point, but Kiefer disagreed. 
"In a room I'm doing now, we are making a floor-to-ceiling limestone fireplace 
as one focal point. In this same room, there will be a curio cabinet for the 
client's incredible collection of fine crystal and Faberge eggs." 
</P>
<P>
 The way to create a focal point is to arrange the furniture to accent the 
focus of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 A focal point in many rooms is the TV set. But it doesn't have to be the only 
one if an arrangement has flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, swivel chairs can help create an arrangement that allows for both 
an intimate conversation area as well as comfortable TV viewing. Let the couch 
face the TV set and place two swivel chairs in the middle of the room between 
the couch and the TV, Sandlin suggested. "This way you can have viewing out of 
those chairs but block the TV when it's not being used." What Size Furniture? 
</P>
<P>
 Striking a balance between the size of the furniture and the dimensions of a 
room is important in creating a living space that does not feel crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 A small room does not mean you have to have tiny furniture, said designer Gay 
Davis Turner of Dana Point. "In condos, for instance, where rooms are usually 
small, people tend to use only small furniture. But you can actually make the 
room seem larger by using, say, an oversized sofa and eliminating one chair. 
It's strictly a matter of balance." 
</P>
<P>
 The height of the room is also important. In Southern California, many houses 
and apartments have high ceilings in small rooms to give the appearance of a 
larger space. Sometimes this gives people a false concept of space, and they 
tend to crowd the room with too much furniture. What Furniture Goes Where? 
</P>
<P>
 Experts advise keeping it simple. Everything you own does not have to be out 
at all times. Putting some pieces in storage and periodically exchanging them 
for furniture already out enables a room to always have a fresh look. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before you decide where things are going to be placed, think of the total 
concept you have for the room," Sanchez said. "If you are only looking at its 
function, it's like only looking at someone's bone structure and not their skin 
and hair. Think of the room as a body and imagine how you would dress it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most designers start by taking the measurements of the room and the dimensions 
of the furniture and laying them out on paper before actually moving anything. 
Working on paper provides the freedom to try things that may seem unusual, such 
as placing furniture at an angle, or using a sofa as a room divider. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical family room or living room might have a sofa, two chairs or a love 
seat, a coffee table and maybe a couple of end tables. "I don't like love 
seats," Kiefer said. "People do not want to sit that close to one another. A 
smaller- scale sofa with two good-size chairs and maybe an ottoman is better." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the keys to a successfully arranged room is making sure there is some 
empty space to give the room a sense of scale. People tend to think if they do 
not have a wall filled up, the room is not finished. Not so, said Sandlin, who 
suggested the open wall can be a great place for a painting or a plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a small room and you just can't live without the modern overstuffed 
furniture, get it in the same color as the walls. It doesn't take up as much 
visual space," said designer RoxAnn Johnson of Spatial Expressions Interior 
Design in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Spacing of the furniture is also important. If furniture is too far apart, it 
hinders conversation. The key is to create a conversation area in which eye 
contact is not farther than about eight feet away. The Coffee Table 
</P>
<P>
 The most common mistakes people make with coffee tables are choosing one that 
is too small and placing it outside arm's reach, which makes it difficult for 
the person trying to put down a glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually put 18 to 24 inches between the coffee table and sofa. Just don't 
make it so tight against the sofa that it is hard to sit down," Kiefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee tables are usually made from either wood, stone, glass or synthetics, 
such as laminates. If it is made of solid wood, it is important to remember it 
will take up a lot of visual space, whereas a glass table will open space up 
visually. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to consider your family in deciding what type of table to get. If 
you have five children and don't want to spend all day wiping spots off the 
glass, you may want to buy stone or wood," Kiefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the room is used primarily for TV viewing, it may be wise to consider a 
slightly higher coffee table, say 22 inches high instead of the standard 18 
inches, Johnson said. A higher table is easier to eat from while watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we did in our house was build an ottoman (from which) the cushion can be 
removed and then used as a table. We put it on casters so when it's not in use 
it can be pushed out of the way," Johnson said. Let There Be Light 
</P>
<P>
 "Light is so important, you don't want to push furniture up against windows or 
glass doors," Turner said. Always make sure there are at least a few feet 
between the furniture and window so light isn't being blocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Every room requires at least three lights of some kind, experts say. Make sure 
the lights are varied to give a more interesting look to the room. It is also 
important to make sure the glare from the lights is not shining on the TV 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandlin suggested using more ceiling lights than lamps. "When you use lamps, 
it can end up looking like a forest with six different trees growing, and lamps 
do not give as much light as good overhead fixtures." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem with floating furniture and using lamps is getting the electrical 
cord out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a raised foundation, putting in floor outlets will solve that 
problem. If the foundation is slab, consider overhead lighting for safety. 
Giving Room Focus 
</P>
<P>
 Furniture placement should reflect the use of a room and give it focus. Here 
is how designer RoxAnn Johnson handled two rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBLEM: Many windows, traffic flow and piano location create arrangement 
constraints in this 17-by-15-foot living room. 
</P>
<P>
 SOLUTION: Furniture arranged around fireplace to create intimate conversation 
area that is also optimal for listening to piano music. Seating space anchored 
by area rug. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBLEM: Wood-burning fireplace and TV competing for space and focal attention 
in 21-by-13-foot living room. Sound system needs update. 
</P>
<P>
 SOLUTION: Remodel fireplace using a gas-only box and install 45-inch TV in 
recessed area above mantel to unite two focal points visually and functionally. 
Set furnishings at 45-degree angle to complement and focus on fireplace/TV and 
window view. Place audio-video components in cabinet next to fireplace; install 
surround-sound speakers and sub-woofer in seating area.

HOME SAFETY; PLAN AHEAD TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year, thousands of people die or suffer serious injuries at home from 
accidents that could easily be prevented. Preventing Falls 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one-third of the fatalities are from falls, most of which involve the 
elderly, although all ages are susceptible. Here are some tips for 
fall-proofing a home: 
</P>
<P>
 * Loose throw rugs on slippery floors are an invitation to disaster. Remove 
them, nail them down or secure them with double-face carpet tape. 
</P>
<P>
 * Move low furniture out of the way, especially if it may obstruct foot 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never leave debris on the floor or stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stairways can especially be a problem. Make sure that they are well lighted 
with easy-to-find light switches at both the top and bottom of the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * If stair riser heights vary, mark the edges of the steps clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Replace worn stair treads. If the stairs are carpeted, secure the carpeting 
to all steps. Replace worn carpeting and avoid deep-pile or dark-colored 
carpeting that makes it difficult to see the edges of the steps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stairs should have handrails. Make sure they are sturdy, are at a 
comfortable height and run the entire length of the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paint the edges of outdoor steps white. Make certain that they, too, are 
well lighted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Install anti-skid strips in the bathtub and grab bars on the walls. Fire 
Survival 
</P>
<P>
 The second leading cause of accidental death in the home is fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * Install smoke detectors at the top of stairways, in the bedroom hallway and 
in other places where heat and smoke would be a hazard. Don't put one by a 
stove or fireplace where it will sound off frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 * Place rechargeable, all-purpose fire extinguishers (rated ABC) in clear view 
away from -- but convenient to -- the range, furnace, fireplace and other 
possibly hazardous locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke detectors and fire extinguishers should carry an Underwriters' 
Laboratory (UL) or Factory Mutual (FM) seal of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 * With your family, plan what to do in case of fire. Don't try to fight a 
large fire by yourself. Get everyone out and call the fire department from a 
neighbor's house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Map out an escape plan in advance. Determine escape routes from each room 
and a safe outdoor meeting place where you can take a family head count. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure exit windows open easily and note garage or porch roofs that can 
aid in escape from a window. Poisoning 
</P>
<P>
 Poisoning is the third largest cause of death in household accidents. Keep two 
essentials on hand: ipecac syrup, the most reliable, safe and effective 
vomiting inducer, and the telephone number of the nearest poison control 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep drugs in their original containers and throw away any leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep medicines locked up. Don't store them in bathroom cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never leave medicine by the bedside. Small children may think it's candy. It 
is also unexpectedly easy to take a medication while drowsy without realizing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gases, especially odorless carbon monoxide, also cause many poisoning 
deaths. Don't leave a car motor running in a garage. Be sure there is ample 
ventilation for indoor fires and when using cleaning compounds and agents. Keep 
space heaters in good repair. Electrical Safety 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid using electrical appliances, such as heaters, hair dryers or radios, 
near water. Install GFI (ground fault interrupter)-protected outlets in the 
kitchen and bath. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never allow lamp or extension cords to cross foot-traffic areas.

WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY, TRY SOME REARRANGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you want a change but you can't afford to redecorate, you can always 
rearrange. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauri Ward has made it her business to help people create a look by editing 
and rearranging furnishings already on hand. And she doesn't limit herself to 
what's in the room in question. She "shops" the whole house for furnishings 
that fit together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine times out of 10, people have that missing piece," said Ward, president 
of Use-What-You-Have Interiors of New York. "We say, 'It would be great to have 
a 36-inch round mirror here,' and they say, 'Gee, I have one in the bedroom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For $195 a room, $300 for a combination room such as a living room and dining 
area, Ward or one of her associates comes into the home, rearranges the 
furniture and accessories and writes a plan suggesting a future color scheme 
and purchases. A session typically lasts two or three hours per room. 
</P>
<P>
 Services such as Ward's appeal to consumers when money is tight and they don't 
want to buy, when they have too much furniture and don't know what to get rid 
of or when they've been transferred to a city for the short term and don't want 
to spend a lot furnishing a new home or a rental. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said much of what makes rooms drab or out of kilter can be corrected by 
rearranging. 
</P>
<P>
 "People hang their pictures too high, or all the heavy furniture ends up in 
one end of the room, or there is too much furniture below eye level and only 
empty wall space above," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Couches and chairs of different heights create a choppy look when used 
together. A solution is to separate pieces of different heights and find pieces 
from other rooms to fill in. 
</P>
<P>
 One particular problem, Ward said, is finding the right niche for a piece of 
inherited furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on size and shape, you can integrate furniture that doesn't seem to 
fit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you inherit a curio cabinet and have modern furniture, Ward suggested 
modernizing the cabinet by filling it with modern items such as framed 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectibles also can add color and texture to a room. Often, it's a matter of 
gathering them into one place. Ward may find framed photographs or pottery 
scattered throughout the room. When put into a single cabinet, she said, they 
create a tremendous visual impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward sometimes helps clients develop a plan that can be put into place over 
months or years. One client's immediate goal was to repaint and rearrange. The 
long-term goal was to replace an area rug and reupholster a sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided if I was going to spend that kind of money, I might as well do it 
with assurance," said the client. Working at her own pace over six months, and 
at Ward's suggestion, she has painted the walls, shuffled the furniture, hung 
decorative plates above the picture molding in the dining area, had some 
artwork reframed and put a piece of marble atop a dry sink. The sofa and rug 
are as yet untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is I know where I'm going when I can afford it," she 
said. "In the meantime, I can look."

START WITH THE SEED OF AN IDEA, THEN DIG IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fullerton Arboretum propagates several thousand tomato plants for sale at 
its annual Green Scene each year. It propagates heirloom tomatoes and other 
varieties not commonly found in retail nurseries.Green Scene this year is April 
23 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Following is the method the arboretum uses to start tomatoes from seed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fill four-inch pots with good potting soil and a sprinkling of slow-release 
Osmocote fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sprinkle a handful of seeds in each pot, top with a little more potting soil 
and moisten well. Place the pots in light shade and continue to keep moist 
until seedlings emerge. (Any seeds that are going to germinate will have done 
so in two weeks.) 
</P>
<P>
 * When the first two leaves of seedlings have emerged and the plants are about 
one inch tall (about the end of the third week), separate into individual 
four-inch pots. Plant the seedlings deep -- nearly up to the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Begin toughening up the seedlings by exposing them to sunlight, starting 
with a few hours a day. By the end of six weeks the plants should be strong 
enough to be transplanted to the sunniest, warmest location in your garden.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: LIGHT TOUCH IS BEST TO CLEAN WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I recently tried cleaning the walls in my bedrooms, which were 
painted two years ago. While the cans say that the paint is washable, the spots 
I cleaned seemed to have worn down a little. If it's washable, what should be 
used to wash it? 
</P>
<P>
 W.Y., Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "Just because it says 'washable' doesn't mean you should get out the 
scrub brush," says Joe Ragsdale of Color Center in La Mirada. "Use a bucket of 
hot water, a soft cellulose sponge and some plain dishwashing detergent. When 
you find a spot, rub the sponge over it softly until the spot goes away. This 
is especially important when cleaning a semi-gloss finish. Don't use anything 
abrasive or you'll end up taking the sheen off. And always keep your eye out 
for stains. The longer they're on the wall, the harder they'll be to remove." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We're planning on putting a four-foot high strip of wallpaper in our living 
room. After putting the wallpaper up, we want to frame it with molding to give 
the walls a "wainscoting" look. Should the molding be nailed into place or 
glued to the wall? 
</P>
<P>
 S.D., Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A: "It's probably best to use finishing nails," says carpenter Steve Arroyo of 
Santa Ana. "And you'll find the job will be a lot easier if you can rent a nail 
gun. The problem with gluing is that years later when you want to redo the 
room, you'll find that getting the glue off the walls will be a problem; it's 
also hard to hold the molding in place while glue sets." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: I'm thinking about replacing the standard interior doors in my house with 
paneled doors. I found paneled doors that are the exact size as the ones I 
have, and they're even pre-hung with hinges. Would making this changeover be 
relatively easy? 
</P>
<P>
 S.A., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A: "It all depends on how handy you are, your tools and your patience," says 
Pete Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. "Hanging doors can be a real 
headache, even for the pros. Pre-hung doors often need a new jamb, which 
requires some special skills to install correctly. You may find that hinges 
appear to match up exactly, but if they're even 1/16th-inch off, you'll have to 
mortise a new position for the hinge and patch the old position, which may not 
look great. Think it over before trying to tackle the job. Even if you know how 
to do it, you may save yourself a lot of time having someone else hang the 
doors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've got to change my window screens this spring, but I need more than the 
usual screen. I want to get something that will allow a good air flow but also 
block out light. What options do I have? 
</P>
<P>
 T.E., Placentia 
</P>
<P>
 A: "When looking around, remember the darker the screen, the less light it 
will admit," says Frank Eckert of Arrow Hardware in Orange. "There is a product 
called SunScreen that is made of a heavy mesh, with thicker strands that block 
a good percentage of sunlight. It's a little more expensive than regular 
screens, but if you're spending a lot on cooling your house during summer, this 
can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have a long hallway in our house, and I'm concerned that in a fire or an 
emergency, it may be difficult for our children to find their way out of the 
house if the power was out. What would it take to install those emergency 
lights that turn on when the power's out in our house? 
</P>
<P>
 C.N., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A: "That's a great safety feature, but it's usually done in a custom home or a 
house that's going through a complete remodel," says David Gallucio of Harbor 
Lites in Costa Mesa. "The wiring is what costs and takes up the most time 
installing. You may be able to wire an emergency light system through the attic 
so that it won't be visible. You may also want to check hardware stores to see 
if there's an emergency light available that (doesn't require wiring)."

THE STYLE FILES: THE PAIN; OUR LIVING HELL; INSTEAD OF DOING A THOUSAND MORE 
PUSHUPS, COULD WE PETITION FOR MORE REALISTIC STANDARDS OF BEAUTY? 
</P>

 I have a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the benign influence of an asteroid, all the truly attractive 
men on the planet suddenly decide they hate buns of steel. Instead, they begin 
searching the highways and byways for women as voluptuous as cream puffs, women 
as warm and soft as Caribbean nations. 
</P>
<P>
 As the newly desirable Rubenesque females graciously accept this tsunami of 
male attention, they smile mysteriously. In their heart of hearts, they know 
they owe it all to "Buns of Eiderdown," the tape that allowed them to stick to 
that oh-so-demanding, but oh-so-rewarding regimen of power-lifting Sacher torte 
and glasses of sherry. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bloody likely. 
</P>
<P>
 To an extent unprecedented in my lifetime, beauty has become linked with pain. 
Women do excruciating things with wax to remove unwanted hair at the root. They 
endure applications of caustic chemicals in hopes that their skin will revert 
to its baby state. They go into seclusion for six weeks, seeing no one but 
their personal trainers, while the swelling goes down on their state-of-the-art 
facelift. And, day in and day out, they crunch and burn on machines that would 
have given the Inquisitors pause in hopes of getting the nod from the doorman 
at a hot Hollywood club, the Southern California equivalent of a papal 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Twiggy, America wasn't like this. Beauty hurt in other parts of the 
world. In far-off lands, the odd body part was ritually pierced or tattooed, 
foot-binding had only recently gone out of fashion and women sometimes had to 
s-t-r-e-t-c-h their lips or even their necks to become irresistible to the 
males of their tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the United States, mild discomfort was the highest price to be paid for 
beauty -- nothing nastier than the occasional pinch of the panty girdle, the 
errant bone in the pushup bra. There was, admittedly, the living hell of 
stiletto heels, but if they were working their wanton magic properly -- on the 
dance floor, for example -- you could eventually kick them off. Let me put my 
head on your shoulder -- and give my aching feet a break. 
</P>
<P>
 The Age of Aquarius was even better. The nursing mother look was in, and who 
needed hard bodies under those undulating layers of Indian fabrics? The beads 
distracted the onlooker's eye from any less-than-perfect feature. The 
fuzzy-edged, tie-dyed patterns confused the guy even more. And the widespread 
ingestion of recreational drugs made the precise evaluation of the muscle tone 
of a potential partner very, very hard indeed. There is some evidence that not 
a single woman counted calories during the entire Summer of Love. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't mean to be flip. Beauty is a serious business, maybe the most serious 
business of all. The drive to attract the people who can impregnate us is a far 
more powerful motivator than any ideology, including feminism. But I wonder why 
it is currently such hard work. Why do women have to train like Ironmen to 
compete in the scrimmage of appetite, as poet Delmore Schwartz called it? 
Instead of doing a thousand more pushups, couldn't we petition for the adoption 
of more realistic standards of beauty? Do we have to look like Susan Powter? 
How about buns of fit female flesh, instead of steel, to start?  
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem with perfection is it takes too damned much time to 
achieve. Life is too short to do 2,500 crunches a week, as Demi Moore is said 
to do. Young women are wasting the best years of their lives draped over 
Soloflex machines. Older women are squandering precious hours on a losing 
battle against time and gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the worst thing that can happen to a woman who starts eating and 
exercising for health, instead of some Draconian ideal of beauty? She may fail 
to attract a man with brains of lead. Or she may lose one. This year, not next. 
</P>
<P>
 Edna St. Vincent Millay offers considerable comfort on this point. "If I had 
loved you less or played you slyly / I might have held you for a summer more, / 
But at the cost of words I value highly, / And no such summer as the one 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the asteroid is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Go for the Sacher torte.

THE STYLE FILES: THE PAIN; MAGNIFICENT OBSESSIONS; JUST HOW FAR DO SOME WOMEN 
REALLY GO TO LOOK GOOD? 
</P>

 The things we do for love? They pale in comparison to the things we do for 
vanity. Here, the real-life stories -- honest -- of seven women with 
magnificent obsessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, Janet Mizrahi found the perfect eyeliner when a friend came back from 
Europe with a glass vial of powdery gray kohl, bought at an Algerian pharmacy 
in Paris. "You dipped this little pencil into the granules and outlined your 
eyes," says Mizrahi, an aspiring novelist. "It was the best eyeliner I'd ever 
had, it never faded or smeared. I used it for 10 years, and every time my 
friend went to Paris she would bring me back more kohl." 
</P>
<P>
 But in time, the friend stopped going to Paris. Then Mizrahi's kohl bottle 
broke. Life hasn't been the same since. "I've tried pencils, I've tried liquid 
liners, I've tried cake," Mizrahi says. "I've spent hundreds of dollars on 
various eye-lining materials, to no avail." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, says Mizrahi, "Rumor had it that a grocery in North Hollywood 
carried beauty products from the Middle East. So I drove over there -- and, of 
course, they did not. As I was driving home, I had a terrible car accident, 
with $8,000 worth of damage to my car. The lawsuit is still going on. And had I 
not been in search of that damn kohl this might never have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when she abandoned the search as too costly. "Now I walk around looking 
like an old lady with nasty eyes," says Mizrahi. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever a cosmetic was jinxed, it may be this kohl. Mizrahi's jet-setting 
friend and original source of the kohl lives in the San Francisco Bay area. She 
lost her vial of kohl in the Oakland fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '80s, when Angela Friedman, a British insurance agent living in 
Los Angeles, would phone her mother in Liverpool, the first order of business 
was blush. Specifically Sun Stick bronzer from Ultima II and where to get their 
hands on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really loved this blush," says Friedman. "It screwed up from the bottom 
like deodorant, it was creamy and had a sheen to it. We both used the same 
shade, and we'd put it not only on our cheekbones but on our nose and brow and 
chin -- it really gave our pale English skin a sun-kissed glow." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman speaks lovingly of the blush's other assets: it was inexpensive, 
stayed neat in her purse, lasted a long time. Too long -- by the time mother 
and daughter ran out, the Sun Stick had been discontinued. "We tried to buy it, 
but it was too late," says Friendman, who looked in L.A. department stores, 
drug stores and discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom would take the bus all over Liverpool. When we'd speak on the phone 
we'd say, 'Did you find it?' It was an international affair. We're talking 
$60-, $70-phone calls, all about this silly makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 She still pines for the blush that faded. There is a glimmer of hope, though: 
When a Revlon spokeswoman heard about this mother-daughter obsession, she 
promised to look into the possibility of a product reintroduction. See, they do 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 All beauty quests aren't in vain, although they may take years to realize. In 
1984, publicist Prudence Baird was sitting in a restaurant when she saw a woman 
at another table. "I kept staring at her beautiful skin, which seemed back-lit, 
it was so translucent," says Baird. "My companion said, 'That's Barbra 
Streisand.' I said, 'No it's not.' I didn't recognize her, I was so mesmerized 
by her skin." 
</P>
<P>
 The search was on to find the facialist responsible. "I asked everyone who had 
ever dealt with Streisand," says Baird. "The woman who runs her foundations. A 
senior v.p. at a major movie studio. A woman who brought Streisand to a party 
once. Her make-up person. I left my name on answering machines all over town. 
And because my last name isn't Spielberg or Lucas, I guess I never got a call 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Baird had facials at posh salons in both New York and Los Angeles, always 
asking the inevitable question. A decade passed. She had just about given up 
hope when she mentioned her search to a reporter friend, who made a few phone 
calls. Twenty-five minutes later, Baird had the facialist's name. And it wasn't 
one of the famous skin fraus she expected.  
</P>
<P>
 "She's just a fine facialist who sells a terrific line of all-natural 
products," says Baird. 
</P>
<P>
 She immediately made an appointment, "which, by the way, I could not get for 
11 weeks. So if you're going to ask me the name of this facialist, I will not 
tell you. Because I will not wait that long for my next appointment." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a small refrigerator tucked inside an etagere in actress Diahann 
Carroll's bedroom, stocked with whole milk. She doesn't drink the stuff, she 
bathes in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really as glamorous as it sounds," she says. "I dump two quarts of 
milk into the bathwater, along with some unscented vegetable oil. Years ago, a 
dermatologist recommended that I bathe in milk because my skin is lacking in 
fatty acids, and so ever since the '60s I've been doing this, twice a day." 
</P>
<P>
 When she's on the road, room service supplies the recommended daily allowance 
of milk. "Actually, it's in my contract," Carroll says. But she's always been 
good-humored about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister played a joke on me once," says Carroll. "I was getting ready for 
my TV show, 'Julia,' and she ran the bath and filled the tub with chocolate 
milk! Just as I was stepping in I said, 'What is this?' And she said, 'We don't 
want to lose an ounce of your pretty brown color.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Women who wear waterproof mascara have special needs: like a means of removing 
it without losing their eyelashes in the process. That's why publicist Linda 
Ford is addicted to Effacil Eye Makeup Remover Gel from Lancome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works better than anything," says Ford, who's been using the product for 
10 years. In 1990, when she discovered it had been discontinued, Ford bought 
out the entire Effacil inventory at Nordstrom. "Then I went to Bullock's 
Westwood," says Ford, "and the salesclerk said, 'Somebody beat you to it -- 
we've already sold out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Effacil drought lasted 1 1/2 years until Lancome brought it back due to 
consumer demand. In the interim, "I was out of Effacil for about six months, 
and it was hell," says Ford. "That's my only obsession -- although I do have a 
savings account for plastic surgery when I get older." 
</P>
<P>
 Who hasn't hesitated to scrub off a really flattering professional make-over, 
knowing that you'll never look that good again? But there is an option 
available if you're game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Harmon, a realtor in Encino, has her face made up every month by Eugenia 
Weston, owner of Valencia-based Senna Cosmetics. Harmon has kept these standing 
appointments for more than 20 years because, she says, "Eugenia is probably one 
of the finest make-up artists in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 And who messes with a work of art? 
</P>
<P>
 "If she does my face on a Saturday," says Harmon, "I'll leave the eye makeup 
on for a few days -- Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. Of course, I always 
wash the foundation off every night. But if you just clean around your eyes 
with a Q-tip, the eye makeup stays on for a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Weston is flattered to have her work preserved in such a way, she 
doesn't recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Harmon, "The only reason Eugenia doesn't kill me is because I take very 
good care of my skin. And if you have good skin, it's easier to do some of 
these unorthodox things." 
</P>
<P>
 Film producer Linda Obst can't live without Philip B.'s botanical shampoo and 
conditioners. Nothing else touches her hair, even on location. 
</P>
<P>
 When she ran out of his products on the set of "Sleepless in Seattle," Obst 
had Philip overnight her a dozen bottles each of peppermint/avocado shampoo 
($16), African shea butter conditioning cream ($18), apple cider vinegar 
finishing rinse ($15), and rejuvenating oil treatment ($25) from his Beverly 
Hills studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Product deprivation struck again recently on the set of her new film, "Bad 
Girls," on location in Sonora, Mexico. This time Philip shipped Obst six 
bottles of each product by Federal Express, enough to keep her supplied no 
matter how long the shoot runs.

TIPS FOR GROWING TOMATOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some suggestions from nursery and gardening experts for cultivating 
healthy tomatoes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tomato plants work hard. Reward them with good soil. Well-decomposed compost 
is the ideal amendment, but redwood mulch is also good. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tomato plants have deep roots; give them room. If planting in the ground 
isn't an option, use a large container. A half whiskey barrel is best, but a 
15-gallon container will do. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tomatoes need lots of sun -- a minimum of six hours per day. More is better. 
Place plants in the sunniest, warmest location in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tomatoes thrive on a consistent watering schedule. Water deeply but not too 
frequently. Every 10 to 14 days is a common recommendation. If growing in 
containers, let the top inch of soil dry out between waterings. Avoid overhead 
watering if possible as it contributes to mildew problems. If that is not 
possible, water early in the day so foliage will dry before evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tomato plants are light feeders. Many gardeners rely on slow-release 
Osmocote added to the soil at the time of transplanting for fertilizing. Others 
prefer more frequent fertilizing with a balanced formula product, like a 
14-14-14 combination. The main thing is not to use a nitrogen-heavy product 
(the first number in the ratio), which produces foliage at the expense of 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tomatoes need a support system. Even compact bush types, bred not to need 
staking, do better propped up in a short cage, say experienced growers. (Fruit 
ripens better off the ground, and the improved air circulation benefits the 
foliage.) Larger varieties that continue to grow until temperatures become too 
cool for them to set fruit need something more substantial than nursery cages. 
The Fullerton Arboretum uses cages of seven-foot-wide, welded wire screening 
(the kind sold for reinforcing concrete). Five feet of wire creates a 1 
1/2-foot cylinder. A heavy, wooden stake, at least six feet tall, would also 
work. A redwood trellis is another, and pretty, option. Trellising also makes 
fruit very visible so ripe tomatoes are not overlooked. Whatever support you 
decide on, put it in when you transplant the seedling, no matter how ridiculous 
it looks towering over the tiny plant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tomatoes attract pests. But there are simple solutions that don't require 
pesticides. Insecticidal soaps, for instance, control aphids, and Bacillus 
thuringiensis-based sprays kill tomato worms. Neither product is toxic to 
people or animals. Planting flowers that attract beneficial insects also helps 
keep pests in check. Cosmos, coriander, alyssum, yarrow and sunflowers are 
examples. SHARON COHOON

SINK OR SWIM; ACTIVISTS WANT OCTOPUS FREED FROM A 4-BY-5-FOOT TANK AT CABRILLO 
AQUARIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The call "Free Octavia!" is rising in San Pedro as activists decry the living 
quarters of a newly captured octopus on display at the Cabrillo Marine 
Aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 The orange-red giant Pacific octopus with a tentacle span of 13 feet is 
residing in a 4-by-5-foot tank. That enrages some mollusk advocates who 
denounce the tank as being much too small. 
</P>
<P>
 So about two dozen of Octavia's fans protested outside the city-owned aquarium 
Friday, calling on its operators to return the octopus to her native ocean 
depths, or at least to provide her with the comforts of a more spacious abode. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please Let Me Go Home!" read one protester's sign, which showed a 
forlorn-looking octopus shedding tears. 
</P>
<P>
 A coldblooded mollusk with eight sucker-lined arms, the Octopus dofleini would 
seem an unlikely catalyst for such an outburst of public affection. It lacks 
the stately grace of the whale, the winsome personality of the dolphin. But 
those concerned insist that octopuses, too, deserve compassion and the freedom 
to stretch their many limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 They dismiss the 600-gallon tank as a mere sink. 
</P>
<P>
 "For an animal that size that's used to living on the ocean floor, it's 
inexcusable cruelty," said Lisa Lange, international campaigns manager for 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a national animal rights group 
that spearheaded the protest. Some even worry that Octavia will fall victim to 
a form of stress they describe as "Octopus Automutilation Syndrome" unless she 
is set free. 
</P>
<P>
 But the aquarium's exhibits director, Mike Schaadt, argues that octopuses do 
not need abundant space. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like close quarters," Schaadt said. "That's where they feel most 
comfortable and most safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The 58-pound Octavia is the first giant Pacific octopus to go on display at 
the Cabrillo aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught by a fisherman off San Clemente Island, the octopus was donated to the 
aquarium by a fish market where fishermen had taken it. She arrived at the 
aquarium Jan. 22.  
</P>
<P>
 Aquarium attendance tripled the first weekend she was on display, and T-shirts 
emblazoned with an orange octopus are on sale at the aquarium gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the charges of animal rights activists, the Cabrillo aquarium did 
not take its new tenant lightly, Schaadt said. It consulted other West Coast 
aquariums about the kind of habitat Octavia would desire. Workers went 
scuba-diving off the Palos Verdes Peninsula to gather rocks for her tank and 
the water temperature was lowered from the typical 60 degrees to 56 degrees to 
resemble the cool ocean floors where she once lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the tank is too small for Octavia to fully extend her tentacles, 
Schaadt said, octopuses typically do not extend themselves unless they are 
searching for food or fleeing a predator.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're really basing a lot of our confidence on the fact that she's eating 
well, and she doesn't show any signs of problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But activists disagree. Mary Beth Sweetland, a director at the animal rights 
group's Rockville, Md., headquarters, said she saw Octavia last week when she 
was in California for an orangutans conference in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the tank was criminally inadequate," Sweetland said. "She was 
smashed up close to the glass between the rock and the glass, and I could not 
see 12-foot arms being able to stretch out to their entirety." 
</P>
<P>
 Four other aquariums that display giant Pacific octopuses report that their 
tanks are somewhat larger. However, officials at those aquariums say the 
mollusks do not require massive amounts of space, especially because they seek 
out crannies to in which to nestle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The happiest an octopus would be is under a rock," said Allen Monroe, 
director of animal husbandry and life support at the Oregon Coast Aquarium in 
Newport, Ore., where a 50-pound giant Pacific octopus lives in about 1,000 
gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Two octopuses each have a 1,640-gallon tank -- shared with a few rock fishes 
and anemone -- at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey. A smaller giant 
Pacific octopus lives in about 800 gallons of water at the Stephen Birch 
Aquarium-Museum at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, part of 
UC San Diego. And at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, the giant Pacific 
octopus lives in a 2,000-gallon tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly who christened the octopus Octavia is uncertain; Schaadt said Cabrillo 
aquarium officials typically do not christen their marine tenants. But a press 
release from the animal rights group refers to the octopus as Octavia, and the 
name was repeated on banners and picket signs hoisted at the Friday protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Christening the octopus may be a tactic to humanize it, Schaadt said. "I think 
that PETA is trying to take any opportunity to anthropomorphize the animal." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaadt said that if Octavia shows any signs of stress or other problems, the 
Cabrillo aquarium will consider releasing her back into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But protesters called for immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
 Octavia "is being held for entertainment, and it's hurting (her)," said Amy 
Christiansen, 22, of Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 As picket signs bristled at the aquarium entrance Friday, schoolchildren 
inside swarmed around the octopus tank, peering eagerly at the entwined 
tentacles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Octavia appeared oblivious to the fuss she is fomenting. Sound asleep, she 
had turned into a mass that resembled nothing more than a large, orange-tinged 
sponge.

GIRL SUSPENDED FOR CONDOM DISPLAY FILES SUIT; COURTS: ACLU CHARGES THAT SCHOOL 
VIOLATED RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH. DISTRICT SAYS HER ACTIONS WERE INAPPROPRIATE.

 Fourteen-year-old Astrianna Johnson said she was so concerned about friends 
who have gotten pregnant, and the spread of the deadly AIDS virus that she 
wanted to make a bold statement about the importance of safe sex: She pinned 
condom packs to her shoes and clothes at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign got Astrianna suspended from school last fall after the principal 
at Bethune Middle School in South-Central Los Angeles said the eighth-grader 
was not old enough to make statements about sex, according to a lawsuit filed 
in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday against the Los Angeles Unified School 
District.  
</P>
<P>
 Astrianna, who says her right to free speech has been violated, said in an 
interview Friday that administrators "should face the fact" that teen-agers her 
age are having sex and that her school should provide better sex education and 
AIDS awareness instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my friends started having babies, when they started having sex without 
protection, that's when I decided to start wearing them (condoms)," said the 
girl, who is back in school and has ceased wearing the packets until the case 
is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, seeks to allow 
Astrianna to wear the sealed condom packages in class with "safe sex" written 
on them as a means to increase student awareness. In the past, Astrianna had 
worn up to five packages on her shoes, jacket lapel and her upper right pant 
leg, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the school district, the lawsuit names Principal Edith H. 
Morris and Assistant Principal Lucreisa Sturns. Morris declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 School district spokesman Bill Rivera said the district administration 
supports the principal's decision to order the girl to remove the condoms and 
suspend her for one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "School administrators felt it was inappropriate," Rivera said, adding that 
the girl had displayed one condom in her crotch area. "Sometimes there is a 
greater right -- that her actions might lead to disrupting other students -- 
and school administration has to take appropriate steps to make sure that 
doesn't happen." Amos Dyson, the girl's ACLU attorney, denied that Astrianna 
ever wore a condom on her crotch. 
</P>
<P>
 Astrianna said: "There really wasn't a lot of reaction from my friends. It 
didn't disturb anyone. They just asked me why I was wearing them. I said if 
they are going to have sex, they have to be safe and use protection." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Sturns told Astrianna to remove condoms from her 
shoe because it conflicted with school policy that promotes student sexual 
abstinence. After she came to school again with condoms on her shoes and pants, 
the girl's mother, Sundra Johnson, was called in. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris said that although displaying condoms was "not clearly prohibited under 
the school rules," it was "distasteful to the administration . . . on the list 
of dangerous things," court records said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundra Johnson disagreed. When her daughter told the principal she had a right 
to wear the packages and would continue to do so, Astrianna was suspended.  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe my daughter has a right to express herself and that she is not too 
young to make a statement like this," Sundra Johnson said. "We have had 
discussions together about sex and when she has questions she knows she can 
come to me. If I don't have the answer, we will find out together." 
</P>
<P>
 Dyson said that Astrianna is expressing her views "in a very discreet and 
subtle way. . . . This was not a circus-like thing. She didn't look like a 
clown." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's health curriculum encompasses a broad range of issues. Middle 
and high school students, who must obtain parental permission, receive about 20 
hours of sex education that includes instruction on AIDS awareness, sexually 
transmitted diseases, safe sex and abstinence, said Claudia Baker, who prepares 
the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Condoms are available to students at all high schools with parental 
permission. Only 3% of parents districtwide refuse to allow their children to 
attend sex education classes, Baker said.

MASONS FORCED TO PUT SCOTTISH RITE TEMPLE UP FOR SALE; LANDMARKS: AS MEMBERSHIP 
FALLS, THE WILSHIRE BOULEVARD BUILDING HAS BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE. ZONING 
RESTRICTIONS HAVE ALSO HURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The eight statues that stand guard outside the Scottish Rite Masonic Temple 
have made it a distinctive part of Wilshire Boulevard for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon after an Easter program, the temple -- which housed National Guard 
troops during the 1992 riots and has been used for funerals of police officers 
-- will be fenced off and closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Headquarters for a branch of the Freemasons, the temple has become the victim 
of steadily declining membership and the Masons' inability to maintain the 
expensive facility while abiding by zoning restrictions that limit rental 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The well is dry," said Gaylord Roten, manager of the building at 4375 
Wilshire Blvd. "The members are just sick, but they can't do anything about it. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Temple officials have said that annual expenses, including utilities, taxes, 
salaries and security, run close to $750,000, but income from dues and rental 
fees amounts to only $275,000. Roten said the lodge's membership has dwindled 
from a peak of about 12,000 in the 1970s to 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 After the closure April 4, temple members will meet temporarily at the West 
Los Angeles Masonic Temple. They are looking at property on San Vicente 
Boulevard near Carthay Circle Park for their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The temple's zoning permit allows it to be rented only to nonprofit 
organizations and groups affiliated with the lodge. But the temple was unable 
to earn enough money to cover expenses under those restrictions, Roten said. 
After missing a chance to apply for a zoning variance in the late 1970s, temple 
officials ignored the restrictions and began renting to commercial groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Longstanding complaints by members of the Windsor Square Assn., a neighborhood 
homeowners group, about parking, noise and trash problems related to events at 
the temple led to public hearings and a City Council decision in December to 
enforce the zoning regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite efforts to cut expenses, temple officials decided they could no longer 
operate the building under those conditions, Roten said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were like the Rock of Gibraltar," Roten said of the massive, four-story 
structure that stretches along the north side of Wilshire between Lucerne and 
Plymouth boulevards. "We used marble imported from quarries in Italy. It's a 
gorgeous building." 
</P>
<P>
 The temple and its two-acre lot are for sale and a number of interested 
parties, including some churches, have toured it, Roten said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was designed by Millard O. Sheets, an artist and architectural designer who 
also painted three murals inside. Construction was completed in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the temple has been the scene of religious services, weddings, 
funerals, concerts and community meetings and events, in addition to serving as 
home base for the lodge's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department has used the building for funerals and other 
events, including a Special Weapons and Tactics team exercise. In 1992, 
National Guard troops deployed during and after the riots made the temple a 
temporary barracks with the cooperation of the membership, Roten said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be sad to see them go," said Sgt. Ron Batesole, community relations 
officer with the LAPD's Wilshire Division. "They were always there for us and 
they were good neighbors."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH BAY; FOUR TO BE 
TRIED IN SLAYING OF COUNCILMAN'S DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Friday ordered four people to stand trial on murder charges in the 
Feb. 9 slaying of an El Segundo city councilman's daughter, and in an attack on 
her 12-year-old child.  
</P>
<P>
 After a two-day preliminary hearing, Judge Thomas Sokolov found sufficient 
evidence to hold Robert Brendon Foster and Linnette O'Neill Blocker, both 18, 
Marcus Terral Brewington, 19, and Erica Dawn Olson, 20, over for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The four, who are being held without bail, will be arraigned in Torrance 
Superior Court on April 1 on murder and attempted murder charges. They could 
face the death penalty if convicted in the slashing and strangulation death of 
Tairree Lynne West, the 25-year-old daughter of Councilman Alan West. The 
murder charge carries a special circumstance allegation that the killing was 
done during a burglary.  
</P>
<P>
 The four also were "held to answer" on a charge of attempted premeditated 
murder stemming from the attack on the dead woman's daughter, Ashley. The child 
was stabbed in the neck and left for dead. Despite a nine-inch gash from the 
top of her cheek to the middle of her throat, the youngster managed to dial 
911.  
</P>
<P>
 Foster, Blocker, Brewington and Olson also are charged with residential 
burglary and child abuse for allegedly gagging West's 4-month-old daughter and 
leaving her on a couch. The infant was not seriously hurt.  
</P>
<P>
 Police believe robbery was one of the motives for the crime, and that West and 
Foster had been involved in a dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Levine said the dispute may have stemmed from West's 
disapproval of a romantic relationship between Foster and Olson. Olson was a 
baby-sitter for the infant, Levine said, and "had a key (to West's apartment) 
and . . . was trusted."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EIGHT YOUTHS, ADULT 
ARRESTED IN 34 ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An adult and eight youths were arrested this week in connection with 34 armed 
robberies that have occurred since January in the San Gabriel Valley and nearby 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra police arrested Joey Hernandez, Michael Avila and Bryan Friedman, all 
18, and Abraham Gonzales, 19, after they saw the four in a car similar to one 
seen at one of the holdups, said Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Gabe 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple City sheriff's detectives later served warrants at seven locations, 
arresting Juan Jabonero, 18; Victor Hernandez, 38, two 17-year-olds and a 
15-year-old. Fifteen handguns, $5,500 in cash and a ski mask were seized. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other suspects were already in custody, Ramirez said. Half of the holdups 
took place in Monterey Park and the others in Alhambra, City of Commerce, 
Hacienda Heights, Montebello and Rosemead. In a March 4 robbery, three teen-age 
waitresses were shot at Paul's Kitchen in Monterey Park. The three remain 
hospitalized, Ramirez said.

 These jury deliberations may really heat up: For more than a day, attorneys 
had squabbled over the admissibility of testimony in a Downtown money-skimming 
trial involving former county sheriff's deputies. The jurors sat in an adjacent 
room and waited, and waited. They were finally called back to the courtroom at 
midday Friday, only to hear U.S. District Judge David Kenyon announce that the 
trial would not resume until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a juror produced a note. The bailiff read it and, sober-faced, 
passed it over to Kenyon. The four defendants, their attorneys, the two federal 
prosecutors, an FBI agent and an IRS agent waited expectantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenyon read the note out loud. "Can we have a microwave?" it said.

 Shop till your building drops: It isn't easy persuading a credit card company 
that you've been mistakenly charged. But Eric Rose succeeded in having an 
erroneous $27.06 department store purchase erased from his account with a 
minimum of argument -- and not because he's a City Council deputy. Rather, it 
was because the sale was listed as Feb. 12 at Bullock's Northridge, which, 
you'll recall, was shut down by Mother Nature on Jan. 17.

 Attention, shopper! Speaking of billings, Dan Steinbrocker doesn't deny buying 
a pair of underwear (see receipt), but he's darned if he remembers buying it at 
a pizza joint. The mix-up apparently stemmed from the fact that the 
Fairfax-area Little Caesar's is inside a K mart. "I've heard the expression, 
'Eat my shorts,' " Steinbrocker said, "but this is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More pre-shocks: We've come across still another sign that prophesied that 
Jan. 17 would be a good day to keep one's head covered. Ray Ceniceroz, who took 
the photo at the Arcadia school, says: "While the reminder to wear a helmet 
proved to be good advice for everyone that shaky day, it was really intended 
for young bicycle riders." 
</P>
<P>
 Dueling Zsa Zsas: We mentioned the other day that a press release put out by 
USC spokeswoman Zsa Zsa Gershick mentioned the existence of the Streisand 
Professorship in Intimacy and Sexuality. Ron Rieder of Sherman Oaks guessed 
which Streisand funded the position, but added, "Zsa Zsa Gershick? Come on, 
Steve!" 
</P>
<P>
 No, really. In fact, we asked Gershick about her name last year and she said: 
"My father was Hungarian, and he adored Zsa Zsa Gabor, so that's how I got the 
name." 
</P>
<P>
 This is probably a convenient time to mention that the other Zsa Zsa did not 
play the title character in the 1958 epic "Queen of Outer Space," as we 
asserted Friday. "She was one of the queen's slaves," a trivia buff told us.

 The history book "Los Angeles 200," states that as late as 1786, "none of 
(L.A.'s) settlers could write." Then, again, the same thing is said these days 
of many of the town's film and TV writers.

OFFICERS RESCUE 9 FROM BURNING BUILDING; HEROES: THE FIVE BRAVE THICK SMOKE

 All in a night's work. 
</P>
<P>
 It was drizzling lightly when Officers Dori Wolfenstein and Kulin Patel got 
the call and made their way to an apartment building filled with black smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a fear of fire, but I do have a fear of smoke," Wolfenstein 
said. "When I first opened the door, I thought, 'How am I going to get in 
there?' But you could see the cleaner air on the bottom, so we got down and 
crawled on our stomachs. . . . As long as I could hear my friends, I was all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Her friends -- Patel and three of their fellow officers from the LAPD's 
Rampart Division -- early Friday morning rescued seven adults and two children 
from a smoke-filled apartment building at 847 S. Alvarado St. They even put out 
the fire, although the Fire Department arrived and finished the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers did it all in a matter of 15 or 20 minutes, and to recognize 
their unusual night of work, their bosses have recommended Wolfenstein, Patel, 
Michael Seguin, Michael Montoya and James DeVito for Medals of Valor. 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday, three of the group met briefly with reporters in the hallway of the 
station across from a vending machine filled with Cheez-Its and M & Ms. DeVito, 
who works undercover, did not want to appear on camera. Patel had not made it 
in yet. On the front desk of the station house sat a gift basket of goodies for 
the heroes, courtesy of Michael Seguin's wife and sister. The officers spoke 
for the television cameras and then strolled into the parking lot, still musing 
over the events of the last 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't see in front of your face -- it was crazy in there for a couple 
of moments," Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeVito, the vice cop, was a little more than an hour away from getting off his 
shift when he saw smoke coming from the MacArthur Park apartment building about 
1:30 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He notified the Fire Department and called for backup. The officers found the 
fire in a second-floor apartment. The carpeting was ablaze and a dazed woman 
was standing in the room. (She is being held in connection with an arson 
investigation.)  
</P>
<P>
 The officers got her out, then crawled from apartment to apartment, yelling 
for people to come out, and finally kicking in doors and guiding people to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Seguin found a fire hose mounted on a wall, broke the glass, and carried it 
into the apartment that was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was spraying the fire; I couldn't see anything," said Seguin, unaware that 
in the midst of the thick smoke, his fellow officers were still in the 
apartment. "They were in there yelling, 'Stop spraying! Stop spraying!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Later at the hospital emergency room where the officers were treated for smoke 
inhalation, "the first thing I thought was, 'Boy, a beer sounds good about 
now,' " Wolfenstein recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 After they were released, they all went home to shower off layers of soot and 
catch some sleep before returning to another night of police work. The smoke 
will still linger in their pores and throats for 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 All in a night's work. Training, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so systematic for us, we never even discussed who was going to do 
what," Wolfenstein said.

GIVES $40,000 TO START DRUG PROGRAM 
</P>

<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman has donated the final funds necessary 
to launch a program that will offer treatment instead of jail to some 
nonviolent drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which officials said signals a shift from an emphasis on 
incarceration, was supposed to begin last month at the Downtown Hall of 
Justice.But after that building was severely damaged by the Northridge 
earthquake, officials found themselves short of funds to relocate the program 
to a county-owned building across from Union Station.  
</P>
<P>
 That is when Edelman stepped in and contributed $40,000 from his office 
discretionary funds -- enough to pay the electricity bill and other operating 
costs at the new site for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now scheduled to begin at the end of April, the program is based on the Drug 
Court, developed with the support of U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno when she was 
Miami's chief prosecutor. For people arrested for the first time on felony drug 
possession charges, it will offer the option of enrolling in a treatment 
program with regular testing, job training and acupuncture to curb addiction 
and job rehabilitation. SAN GABRIEL VALLEY

OUT OF COMMISSION; AFTER 25 YEARS, THE CAYUGA TANK CARRIER OUTLIVES ITS 
USEFULNESS 
</P>

 She has landed Marines in South Vietnam and dropped anchor at the Persian 
Gulf. She has carried tens of thousands of sailors out to sea and brought them 
home amid brass bands and joyful tears. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the tank carrier Cayuga docked at Long Beach on Thursday afternoon, 
greeted by a welcoming throng of 250 people or more, there was an unprecedented 
poignancy in the salty air: After 100 days off the coast of Somalia, and a 
quarter of a century of unflagging service to her country, the 8,300-ton ship 
was not merely home. She was home for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Rendered obsolete by the shrinking defense budget and the swift pace of 
technology, the Cayuga wrapped up its last mission on Thursday with just one 
stop left -- the Navy graveyard. The ship, one of the last of its kind, is 
scheduled to be mothballed in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cayuga is still a good ship, and if we weren't going for a smaller Navy, 
it might have stayed around a while longer," said Navy spokesman Lt. Karl 
Johnson. "But with the present direction, we need ships that can carry out 
multiple missions, and unfortunately, the Cayuga's function is singular -- it's 
a tank-landing ship. It can carry land equipment, but it can't carry 
helicopters, and the newer amphibious assault ships can carry three times as 
many troops." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Long Beach Naval Station was home to a respectable fleet of 38 
ships, Johnson said, but in the past three years, peacetime belt-tightening has 
shrunk that number dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 11 ships are now home-ported in Long Beach, Johnson said, and by the end 
of September, seven of those will be gone. Four will stay in Long Beach, four 
will move to new ports, and three will be decommissioned and put into storage 
or leased. 
</P>
<P>
 After a monthlong leave, Johnson said, the crew of the Cayuga will return to 
say goodby. They will secure the engineering compartments, pack up the 
lifeboats, and cart off the computers and radar. They will swab the decks and 
pay one last homage to that old Navy adage: "If it moves, grease it -- if it 
doesn't, paint it," and then they will bid a ritual farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 The captain, Cmdr. Edward Weiss, will be the last to leave the ship. The 
marching band will play "Taps." And then the shipyard crew will swarm over the 
Cayuga again, readying it for towing to one of the Navy's ship cemeteries, 
otherwise known as inactive ship maintenance facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's atmosphere bore little resemblance to a funeral, as the 235 crew 
members were met by loved ones carrying roses and flags. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before he left, I thought about this day," said Tootie Romero, 24, as 
she waited for her husband, Guillermo. 
</P>
<P>
 Their youngest child "has cried every single day he's been gone," said Romero, 
who drove eight hours from San Manuel, Ariz., to greet her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was Seaman Steve Crawford particularly nostalgic about the ship. "I have 
no feeling for it. None," he said, rushing headlong toward his wife and their 3 
1/2-month-old daughter, born while he was at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson said the crew of the Cayuga will have more of a soft spot than 
they realize for the vessel once she is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a sailor, you grow attached to your ship," he said. "You put your life's 
blood into operating it. You think of it as a good friend -- and like a good 
friend, you believe it will be there forever."

WOMAN ACQUITTED ON 2 OF 3 CHARGES IN SPOUSE'S CASTRATION; COURTS: WIFE IS FOUND 
NOT GUILTY OF MAYHEM AND ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON AFTER HER HUSBAND'S 
TESTICLES WERE CUT OFF. A RETRIAL WILL BE SOUGHT ON CHARGE OF BATTERY, ON WHICH 
JURY DEADLOCKED.

<P>
 A Los Angeles woman accused of severing her sleeping husband's testicles with 
scissors was acquitted Friday of the main charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court jury that heard the castration case against Aurelia Macias, 
35, found her not guilty of mayhem and assault with a deadly weapon -- charges 
that could have given her an 11-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a lesser charge of battery, and the 
prosecutor said he would seek another trial on that count. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury forewoman Claudia Marshall, 56, said the panel believed that Macias had 
been "verbally and emotionally abused throughout the marriage" and was probably 
in fear of her life on the night of Sept. 20, 1992, when the castration 
occurred in the couple's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said the jury was not influenced by evidence that Macias' husband, 
Jaime, has long wanted to drop the charges against his wife and to reconcile 
the 17-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall and other members of the jury said they did not believe Jaime Macias 
was in a drunken sleep at the time of the attack, as Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry 
Longo had alleged. The prosecutor said Macias attacked her husband out of 
jealousy after he danced with other women at a party. 
</P>
<P>
 Longo compared the case and its outcome to the case of Lorena Bobbitt, a 
Virginia woman who cut off her husband's penis but was found not guilty by 
reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor accused Macias of mimicking the tearful courtroom testimony of 
Bobbitt, who said she attacked her husband after he raped her. In Macias' case, 
she contended that her husband had tried to force her to have sex with him 
before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias' defense lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Nan Whitfield, said her client 
should never have been brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 She accused the prosecution of "inefficient use of public money" in trying a 
case in which the defendant was acting in self-defense, was unlikely to commit 
another crime and in which the victim did not want to press charges.

MOTHER CHARGED WITH TRYING TO KILL CHILDREN 
</P>

<P>
 Blaze: A toddler and an infant suffered smoke inhalation and are hospitalized 
with second-degree burns. Firefighters had to break through a security gate to 
extinguish the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Two small children were hospitalized with second-degree burns Friday after 
their mother allegedly tried to kill them by setting fire to the family's 
apartment in Willowbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 LaTunga Stark, 22, was booked by sheriff's deputies on charges of arson and 
attempted murder of her 2-year-old son, Rushon White, and her 8-month-old 
daughter, LaTina Stark Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Rushon was in stable condition at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center 
and LaTina was in serious condition at the burn ward of County-USC Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The children also suffered smoke inhalation from the fire that broke out 
Thursday afternoon in the two-story apartment building in the 11800 block of 
Alabama Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors climbed a spiked fence around the building and persuaded Stark to 
hand the children to them through a window of her first-floor apartment shortly 
before county firefighters arrived. Firefighters had to break through a 
security gate to extinguish the blaze, which caused minor damage to the 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark was initially held on suspicion of child endangerment, but was booked on 
the more serious accusations after arson detectives investigated the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department released no motive for the incident, but firefighters 
said Stark appeared to be mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just acting erratic and uncontrollable," said Fire Capt. Dennis 
Walsh.

AL MARTINEZ: HELLO, SWEET SPIRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have it on good authority that Holly Hunter will win the best actress award 
Monday night for her portrayal of an erotic mute in "The Piano." The prediction 
is solid. It comes from the spirit world. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently deceased Greta Garbo passed it on to me through Kenny Kingston, who 
is L.A.'s self-proclaimed Psychic to the Stars, both living and dead. Gloria 
Swanson, also deceased, says Liam Neeson will win best actor for "Schindler's 
List." 
</P>
<P>
 "All the spirits voted for 'Schindler's List' as best picture too," Kingston 
said the other day in his Studio City home. He is a pink-faced man with glowing 
blond hair and a tendency toward expansive gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the ceremonies, they're going to party at the Sinatra compound in Palm 
Springs. He'll feel them there but, of course, he won't see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kingston says all this with such disarming flamboyance that you almost believe 
him. At one point in our conversation he said hello to Marilyn Monroe so 
naturally that I turned, expecting to see her standing behind me. Is that weird 
or what? 
</P>
<P>
 I went to see Kingston because I knew he would have some sort of telepathic 
contact with celebrities beyond the grave who, given their spiritual powers, 
could name this year's Oscar winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in L.A. is talking about the Academy Awards and making predictions. 
We are nothing if not a movie town. This was never clearer than at a Westside 
saloon the other night when two men began punching each other out over the 
comparative talents of Winona Ryder and Emma Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen a lot of bar fights in my day, but never over best supporting 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a columnist expected to be occasionally topical, I began scratching around 
for an approach to the Oscars that had not been used to excess. I even thought 
about a People's Poll for the Worst of Everything, including worst picture of 
the year, worst actor and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 My personal choice was an art film about sex in China, the name of which, 
thank God, I can't remember. It was on an artistic level with "Ace Ventura, Pet 
Detective," but more scatological. 
</P>
<P>
 I was really getting into this when Kenny Kingston called. I knew it was him 
before he gave his name when he said "Hello, sweet spirit." He calls everyone 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a copy of one of the books I'd written had fallen from a shelf in his 
study not once but twice and he knew it was a message from the spirit world for 
him to call me. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingston does radio and television and plays the clubs, so it was not unusual 
for him to telephone a newspaper source hoping for a little mention. But mostly 
people are directed to us by living publicists like Stan Rosenfield or Lee 
Solters, and not by the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 I was intrigued by this so I said what're you up to, sweet spirit, and he said 
that HBO and the BBC were sending crews over to televise his spiritual 
predictions for the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah ha.  
</P>
<P>
 It was like a message from beyond for me too, telling me to be a conduit for 
Oscar predictions that emanate from what Shakespeare called the undiscovered 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 How many other newspaper columnists get to be involved in a kind of daylight 
seance with stars who have long since taken their final bow? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Kingston didn't light candles, ask me to join hands or speak 
in tongues. He mostly bounced around his study, pausing occasionally to look 
off toward the distance, and handed down the spiritual messages. 
</P>
<P>
 After he told me who would win best actor and actress awards and what movie 
would be named best picture, he came up with another flash from beyond: Liz 
Taylor was Michael Jackson's mother in another life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Burton told me," he said, holding a finger to his temple. "That's why 
there's such a strong bond between Taylor and Jackson, sweet spirit. Burton was 
the father. They had a baby girl who was reborn as a boy. The boy was Michael." 
</P>
<P>
 That was an extra he threw in before he quoted James Dean as saying Tommy Lee 
Jones would win best supporting actor for "The Fugitive" and (quoting Ingrid 
Bergman) Emma Thompson would win for "In the Name of the Father." 
</P>
<P>
 As I thought about it later, I felt a little silly for having sat there taking 
notes for two hours and asking Kingston to repeat comments he was receiving 
from the dead, but what the hell. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost spring and I'm taking a short vacation and this is a nice way of 
dancing off the stage before the rotten eggs fly. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, sweet spirits, I just remembered, the name of that lousy movie was 
"Sex and Zen." It's about a man and his dog and his concubine in the Mysterious 
East. Michael Landon says don't bring the kids. Amen.

LITTLE GROWTH OR DECLINE IN MEMBERSHIP IS SEEN AT NATION'S CHURCHES; TRENDS: 
THE SIZE OF DENOMINATIONS HELD STEADY FROM 1991 TO 1992, DATA SHOWS. MOST 
REPORTED INCREASES OR DECREASES OF 1% OR LESS. 
</P>

<P>
 Church growth appears to be flattening out in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that not one of the nation's 10 largest church bodies 
reported a membership decline of more than 1% in the new "Yearbook of American 
and Canadian Churches 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 But neither were there any signs of dramatic church growth, with most churches 
reporting increases of less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 For churches such as the Southern Baptist Convention, coming off a generation 
of rapid increases that helped it become the nation's largest Protestant 
denomination, the church growth figures indicate a spiritual malaise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're crying out to God for a fresh touch for our land. We pray that it will 
fall upon Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Baptists," said the Rev. Mark 
Coppenger, a Southern Baptist spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our main agenda right now -- revival in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The church membership figures, collected by the National Council of Churches, 
are not always comparable from denomination to denomination because most church 
groups keep their own statistics and use different methods for determining 
their memberships. Some denominations only make estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the church council says that the yearbook data is as near an official 
record of denominational statistics as is available. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest edition of the yearbook, no substantial membership changes were 
reported by the nation's 10 largest churches from 1991 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year represents a fairly stable year across the board," said Kenneth 
Bedell, yearbook editor. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc. reported a 2.5% membership gain, 
going from 8 million to 8.2 million members. The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints reported a 2.16% jump from 1991 to 1992, with membership 
increasing to 4.43 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest religious group, the Roman Catholic Church, grew 1.63% to 
59.2 million members in 1992, according to the yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
 But most large church bodies reported membership gains or declines of less 
than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America lost two-tenths of a percent to 
drop to 5,235,000 and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) dropped .53% to 
3,758,000. The Episcopal Church added about 20,000 members to increase slightly 
to 2,492,000. The United Methodist Church dropped .71% to 8,727,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For mainline churches, such membership figures are blessings compared to the 
steep declines of past decades, which cost them substantial portions of their 
flocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we are observing in the denomination is, in a sense, some good 
news, because the rate of loss has been reduced," said the Rev. Mearle Griffith 
of the United Methodist General Council on Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has the rate of membership loss been halved in the last two or three 
years, he said, but some annual conferences are reporting membership gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative religious groups, which had enjoyed steady growth in recent 
years, are now facing leaner years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod reported growing less than a tenth of a 
percent to 2.6 million members. The Southern Baptist Convention reported an 
increase of .83% to 15.36 million members. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist William McKinney, dean of the Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, 
said membership trends seem to follow sociological trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Protestant denominations that have lost up to a third of their members since 
the mid-1960s are down to a more committed core of members, McKinney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to lose more people when you start from a smaller base," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, growth in conservative denominations has been slowed by lower 
population growth in the United States and the fact that many immigrants from 
Latin America, Asia and the Middle East are not the traditional pool from which 
conservative Protestant churches draw members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coppenger, vice president for convention relations of the Southern Baptist 
Convention, said the news is not all bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still growing at the rate of 750 members and five churches a week," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, the denomination is envious not only of its past success but 
of church growth movements in other parts of the world, such as Korea, Kenya 
and throughout Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems there's a hardening in America that you don't find in some of the 
mission fields around the world," he said.

8 WOMEN MADE KNIGHTS OF ST. GREGORY, FIRST IN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WATSONVILLE CELEBRATES REBIRTH OF ST. PATRICK'S; LANDMARKS: CEREMONY MARKS THE 
COMPLETION OF A REPLICA OF THE CHURCH, WHICH WAS DEVASTATED IN THE LOMA PRIETA 
EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than four years after an earthquake devastated its 86-year-old church, a 
Catholic congregation celebrated St. Patrick's Day by completing its new one. 
</P>
<P>
 The new St. Patrick's is a replica of the beloved old church -- and an emblem 
of this farming community, its hardships and its hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a landmark both physically and spiritually. It's a real focal point in 
the community. It's a prominent symbol that people identify with," Mayor Lowell 
Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it's really significant that it's been brought back from the rubble," he 
said. "It's a testimony to the spirit of the people of Watsonville." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of St. Patrick's set the new cornerstone into the right front corner 
of the new church Thursday. The old cornerstone was previously set into the 
opposite side. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony was conducted in the church plaza, which was crammed with several 
hundred people, many wearing green to mark St. Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful day and I'm glad you're all here to share," the pastor, 
Father Michael Miller, told the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd included Alma Torres, who said it felt "good to have our church 
back. Our spirits are more uplifted now. We feel more together." 
</P>
<P>
 The old stained-glass windows and doors were installed in the new building, 
which has a modern interior. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a magnificent structure. It looks better than the old church did," said 
Leo Ruth, a parishioner and retired engineer who coordinated the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Services won't be held until May, and the formal dedication will take place 
Oct. 17 -- the five-year anniversary of the Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Watsonville, 70 miles southeast of San Francisco, was hit hard by the 
magnitude 7.1 temblor. One person died, and about 1,900 homes and businesses 
were destroyed or damaged, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Patrick's, a large Gothic-style church built in 1903, suffered serious 
structural damage. At first, the congregation thought it could repair the 
building. It was chagrined to learn that would cost about $1.2 million more 
than the $2.5 million initially available, Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition of the church was a blow to residents of Watsonville, non-Catholics 
as well as parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a grand church. It was part of our hometown, part of our Main 
Street. And when they had to demolish it, it was like we had lost an old 
friend," said Tana Roberts, a deputy city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the new one looks so much like the original one I can hardly remember it 
being torn down now," she said. "It's like replacing an old friend."

 After servants of God sexually abuse youths a Roman Catholic archdiocese faces 
bankruptcy because of clergy abuse suits. When a treatment center for 
pedophiles is closed, other churches try in vain to insure against clergy 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Acts of retribution from God? 
</P>
<P>
 No -- insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 As clergy sex abuse cases unfold and court judgments rise into the hundreds of 
millions of dollars, insurers have become important arbiters of issues, 
including compensation for victims and how sex offenders will be treated. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious and mental health officials are concerned that as insurers take 
an increasingly hard-line approach to settling lawsuits or renewing liability 
coverage, abusive clergy seeking help will be forsaken, as will their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only sex offender treatment I foresee is in the prisons," said Donald 
Hands, former director of the Barnabas Center, a treatment center for sexual 
disorders in Oconomowoc, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost estimates for the priest sex-abuse scandals in the United States reach as 
high as half a billion dollars. And that is only in the Catholic Church. 
Experts say the scandal cuts across denominational lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact figures are unknown because churches and insurance companies are 
reluctant to reveal settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we gave out numbers, then each case would want to settle for that same 
amount," said the Rev. Ron Wolf, former chancellor of the Santa Fe archdiocese 
in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 What is clear is that insurance companies are being asked "to pay the lion's 
share," said Jeffrey Anderson, a Minneapolis attorney for abuse victims. 
</P>
<P>
 But many insurance companies are balking at paying, and some have responded 
with lawsuits against churches they say should have known better than to hire 
priests who had a history as sexual abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Fe, Archbishop Michael Sheehan is asking parishes for cash to avoid 
bankruptcy court as the archdiocese grapples with scores of sex-abuse lawsuits 
that could cost up to $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials praised archdiocesan insurers, Lloyds of London and 
Interstate Fire and Casualty, for helping to pay for 16 settlements related to 
the alleged victims of former priest Jason Sigler. 
</P>
<P>
 But archdiocesan officials said insurance companies have refused to pay in 
other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Weissman, a spokesman for Lloyd's in New York City, declined an 
interview, saying it is against Lloyds' underwriters policy to discuss cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Several insurance companies have sued the archdiocese of Santa Fe in federal 
court, alleging negligence in overseeing the assignments of known pedophile 
priests. The archdiocese countersued insurers in state district court, alleging 
that the companies failed to uphold their contracts with the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wisconsin, the Barnabas Center closed last May because church insurance 
plans would no longer pay for inpatient care for clergy, said Hands, who 
co-founded the sexual disorder facility in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment can become expensive because inpatient programs cost from $250 to 
$800 per day, and can last up to 18 months. Most insurance companies cringe at 
the amount, and churches, dried up from settlement awards, cannot make the 
payments, Hands said. 
</P>
<P>
 For local churches, the bottom line is often rising insurance costs and 
limited or no coverage for clergy sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Dziak, president of Great American Insurance Co. in Albuquerque, said 
that the payment crisis in New Mexico has made it difficult for all churches to 
buy insurance, and pastoral liability coverage will not be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to cover churches. The lawsuits are causing a ripple effect 
throughout insurance companies that insure churches," Dziak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ogden, insurance risk manager for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), said 
the Presbyterian churches may get coverage, but every underwriter had an 
exclusionary provision for child molestation and pastoral liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden added that "insurance companies are running scared," and policies have 
become costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even expensive policies do not ensure payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although churches are forcefully litigating and using hardball tactics, 
insurance companies will not pay if you are guilty" of sex abuse, said Steve 
Goldstein of Insurance Information Institute, an insurance industry 
clearinghouse in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Servants of the Paraclete, a treatment center in Jemez Springs, N.M., 
agreed to a $5.6 million settlement for victims of former priest James Porter 
in Minnesota and to a $2-million settlement for his victims in New Mexico. The 
Servants of the Paraclete said it was assigning them its rights against 
insurance carriers, and that the settlements would be collected from the 
insurers, not from the treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
 But the treatment center is still in court seeking reimbursement from its 
three chief insurers, Catholic Mutual Relief Society of America, Great American 
Insurance Co. and St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. for alleged breach of 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Other treatment centers fear they also will be held accountable if treatment 
doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Kaplan, director of Alpha Human Services in Minneapolis, said the 
possibility of recidivism cannot be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an unfortunate concept to hold centers accountable for recovery of 
patients. A treatment program cannot guarantee that a patient will not 
re-offend," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon there will be no treatment centers," Kaplan said.SEX CRIME

MIKE PENNER: EVERETT, RAMS, FANS ALL BETTER OFF TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Everett, Saint? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what they're calling him in New Orleans today, a sizable mark-up from 
what they were calling him in Anaheim the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett for a seventh-round draft pick in 1995? 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise there, really. Last November, the Rams replaced Everett in the 
lineup with a ninth-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett, ex-Ram, starting for New Orleans while Bobby Hebert, ex-Saint, 
starts for Atlanta and Chris Miller, ex-Falcon, starts for the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 It's called musical quarterbacks, NFC West style, but what does it mean, now 
that the music has stopped? 
</P>
<P>
 Not much in the standings. San Francisco remains the team to beat, same as it 
ever was, because the best quarterback in the division, Steve Young, is staying 
put. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the Rams, Friday's trade was tantamount to lifting a grand piano off 
their backs. "I think the trade will be met with relief," said Jackie Slater, 
the Rams' veteran offensive tackle. "Relief for all parties concerned. Now Jim 
can start his new career and get rid of all the negatives he had here in L.A. 
And now the Rams can move past the Jim Everett era." 
</P>
<P>
 In New Orleans, Everett was so relieved he showed up giddy for his 
introductory press conference. "This is the proudest day of my life," he 
declared, "knowing that someone believes I can do the job." He also said, "This 
is the most exciting time of my life since being drafted." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Orange County, Ram fans are nodding and saying, "The feeling is 
mutual, Jim, the feeling is mutual" in between celebratory sips of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jim Everett era. Talk about your loaded statements. Has there been a 
career, anywhere, in any era, to equal Everett's eight years with the Rams? 
Where an athlete nears the pinnacle of his profession, at his supposed physical 
prime, is roundly assessed to be The Next Big Thing -- and then falls entirely 
off the map, despite having suffered no injury or illness, by the age of 30? 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Blass, the old Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher, mysteriously forgot how to 
throw the ball over home plate, but Blass was never supposed to replace Tom 
Seaver and Bob Gibson at National League Cy Young Award ceremonies. Once upon a 
time, Everett was going to supplant Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Sax, when he played second base for the Dodgers, developed a mental 
block so fierce that he could no longer make the short throw to first base. But 
through psychiatric assistance and hard work, Sax became a capable second 
baseman again, earning free-agent millions with the New York Yankees. Once 
Everett lost it -- nerve, verve, self-esteem, whatever -- there was no 
reclaiming it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't put a finger on it," Slater said, "but the lost-confidence thing 
affected everybody involved. The first person it affects, obviously, is going 
to be him, but it was a devastating thing for the Rams, for the franchise. 
There was a time when Jim brought a lot of prominence and pride to the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was also devastating to the fans, because the people of Southern 
California wanted Jim Everett to be this great quarterback, to lead this great 
passing game. They wanted him to be a Montana, to lead them to the promised 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it didn't happen, it was such a disappointment. For all concerned -- the 
people in management, in charge, the people who pay the salaries. It was the 
end of so many big hopes." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater wonders if there wasn't something more he could have done, as an 
offensive lineman, since he owns no Ph.D. in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, and regrettably, if he was shy in the pocket at times, I might 
have been partially responsible," Slater said. "It's my sworn duty to protect 
my quarterback. If he became anxious in the pocket, it's a direct reflection on 
me, that he thinks his protection is breaking down." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater mentioned the "Phantom Sack" of the 1989 season's NFC title game. When 
the topic is Everett, everyone gets around to it eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally believe that so much was made of that play, so much to do, that 
it was the beginning of a snowball effect," Slater said. "It was such a big 
game, against one of our biggest rivals. I'm sure that was a big part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, it really didn't cross my mind. I had no idea what happened to 
him. All I know is my quarterback's on the ground, and I'm thinking, 'Well, I 
got my guy here, so it must have been someone else's guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be no one else's guy -- Everett took it upon himself to cover 
up and hit the deck -- but Slater said, "I don't believe anybody on our team 
realized it, only the people watching the game on TV. They saw the instant 
replay time and time again. On the replay, it seemed like he had no reason to 
go down." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett was never the same after that game, and Friday, he admitted that "I 
didn't always have confidence in myself and the people around me didn't have 
confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, who accompanied Everett in thousands of huddles, post-Phantom Sack, 
disputes that notion, kind of. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we lost faith in Jim," he said, "but we all knew Jim was 
struggling . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when you wondered if he had all the technical wrinkles 
ironed out. Especially when we were facing a team with a furious pass rush. You 
wished he had all the wrinkles ironed out then, because there so little margin 
for error." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. A team with a furious pass rush. Could Slater be referring to . . . oh, 
I don't know . . . the New Orleans Saints?  
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Everett's so happy. No more Rickey Jackson in his breast plate. No 
more nose-to-nose Breathalyzer tests with Renaldo Turnbull. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Everett stands to get booed in Anaheim only once next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some good times with him," Slater said. "He was a good quarterback, one 
of the better ones I've played with. The guy competed. At one point, he was 
getting the job done as well as anybody in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 And now he goes to New Orleans for the seventh-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 How he got from there to here, much like Tom Mack's illegal motion penalty in 
'74, much like Tom Dempsey's blocked field goal in '76, is something the Rams 
and their fans may never be able to fully comprehend.

WOODBRIDGE GETS FLOORED; STATE CHAMPIONSHIP: SACRAMENTO EL CAMINO HALTS 
WARRIORS' TITLE BID WITH A 71-38 VICTORY IN THE DIVISION II FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the aftermath, there was little that could be said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge senior Jamie Oenning, her shoulder resting on a wall, asked a 
reporter the final score. 
</P>
<P>
 He replied: "71-38." 
</P>
<P>
 Oenning looked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phooh," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that summed up Woodbridge's first trip to the State Division II girls' 
basketball championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento El Camino (36-0), the senior-dominated Sac-Joaquin Section 
champion, looked right at home on the Oakland Coliseum Arena floor Friday and 
took the air right out of Woodbridge in a battle of the unbeaten teams. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Eagles' third game in the arena in eight days, and it might as well 
have been their home gym. They were not only looser than the Warriors -- who 
started only one senior -- but were quicker, scrappier, tougher and more 
focused. They dominated all but the game's first five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were up for the challenge, but we just got beat by a better team," 
said Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs, whose team finishes the year at 32-1. "They 
got us every which way." 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shooting. El Camino was 23 of 53 (43.4%); Woodbridge 16 of 66 (24.2%). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three-point shooting. El Camino was four of 13 (30.8%); Woodbridge one of 
16 (6.3%). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free-throw shooting. El Camino was 21 of 35; Woodbridge five of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rebounding. El Camino had 42; Woodbridge had 34. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Turnovers. El Camino scored 18 points off Woodbridge's 23 turnovers; 
Woodbridge scored 11 off El Camino's 18 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Intimidation. El Camino's Emily Hart, a 6-foot-3 stalk of bamboo, blocked 
six shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, it affected us," said Woodbridge sophomore guard Tami Weaver. 
"Usually Erin (Stovall) and (Oenning) are driving to the basket. Did you notice 
there wasn't much of that going on?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard not to notice. Hart got a piece of everyone before the night was 
over. She not only played a major role on defense but also scored 13 points and 
had a game-high 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hart was not alone in creating a fluster among Woodbridge players. El 
Camino's pressing defense paid dividends in the third quarter when the Eagles 
blew the game open. 
</P>
<P>
 What had been an eight-point halftime deficit, 27-19, turned disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Burgess (nine points, seven rebounds) cut the lead to 27-21 just 40 
seconds into the half. Then came a 23-1 run by the Eagles, replete with three 
three-point baskets by three players and another three-point play. When Erin 
Stovall (seven points) scored with 42 seconds left in the quarter, giving 
Woodbridge 24 points, the Warriors also trailed by 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the third quarter we might have gotten a little impatient," Bangs said. 
"We talked at halftime about chipping away, but . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kristin Niemann (21 points) made a three-pointer, then came back with a 
three-point play and then, well, then there was no turning back the momentum 
that began late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once it got rolling, the snowball kept getting bigger and bigger," El Camino 
Coach Bill Baxter said. "We played very well. . . . We had some role players 
that stepped up." 
</P>
<P>
 Among them were Christina Massetti and Kristina Barry, who limited 
Woodbridge's Melanie Pearson to three points. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson presented matchup problems for El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 Oenning was the only Warrior to do any real damage. She had a team-high 15 
points and nine rebounds, and a game-high six steals. She also committed only 
one turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 But after taking a 13-6 lead on Oenning's three-point basket, Woodbridge 
missed 15 consecutive shots and committed eight turnovers before Oenning scored 
again; El Camino outscored the Warriors, 14-1, during the run.

RAMS TRADE PICK FOR CHARGERS' LEWIS; FOOTBALL: WIDE RECEIVER WILL EARN $600,000 
AND BECOMES THE TEAM'S LEADING CANDIDATE TO RETURN PUNTS AND KICKOFFS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Rams, climbing close to the salary cap and therefore short on money to 
pursue Houston wide receiver Haywood Jeffires, traded a fourth-round pick in 
the 1995 draft to the Chargers Friday for wide receiver Nate Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, 27, who will earn $600,000 this season, immediately becomes the team's 
leading candidate to return punts and kickoffs. The Rams had expressed interest 
in Phoenix return specialist Johnny Bailey and Detroit's Mel Gray but found 
their salary demands prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nate can still go the distance," said Bobby Beathard, Charger general 
manager. "He can still run the 40-yard dash in a hair under 4.5, he will work 
hard and he's a good example for other players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really didn't want to do this, but we have three young guys and two of 
them have lower salaries. Nate's been a terrific player for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams traded quarterback Jim Everett and his $2.65-million contract to New 
Orleans on Friday to help their salary cap situation. The team would like to 
sign Jeffires but is waiting on Houston to see if the Oilers will match the 
Rams' $4-million, four-year offer sheet to tackle Kevin Donnalley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers have until Wednesday to match the Rams' offer or free Donnalley. In 
the meantime, the Rams believe Jeffires is running out of options and will have 
to consider lowing his salary proposal of $2 million per season. Jeffires said 
he will sign with the Oilers, Redskins, Broncos or the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos, however, reportedly extended an offer sheet Friday to Charger 
wide receiver Anthony Miller, and the Redskins, like the Oilers, have serious 
salary cap concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Rams went with Lewis, who was also being pursued by the 
Bears and Redskins. Washington on Friday offered the Chargers a fourth-round 
pick in this year's draft for Lewis, but their proposal came five minutes after 
the Rams and Chargers had sealed their deal for Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brings a lot to the table," Coach Chuck Knox said. "He's a fine receiver 
and a good kick and punt returner." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, 5-11, 198, started nine games last season opposite Anthony Miller and 
caught 38 passes for 463 yards with four touchdowns. Lewis, a seventh-round 
pick from Oregon Tech in 1990, led the Chargers in kickoff returns with 33 for 
an average return of 20.7 yards.

STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; PREP SWIMMING ROUNDUP; VICTORY OVER FOOTHILL 
GIVES MARINA GAUGE OF THIS YEAR'S TALENT 
</P>

<P>
 It's time for a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the start of the boys' swimming season, Marina Coach John Wright 
weighed the swimmers he lost to graduation against those he had returning. Six 
key members of Marina's 1993 Division I Southern Section team champion had 
moved on, and the outlook was questionable at best. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 97-73 nonleague victory over Foothill Friday at Tustin, Wright's 
questions are beginning to answer themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased," Wright said. "It was hard to tell where we'd be, but I'm 
really pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 And for good reason. Not only did the victory give the Vikings a 4-0 start, 
Marina defeated Foothill without Section finalist Paul Liegeois and Section 
qualifier Blaine Morgan, club swimmers who leave today for a junior national 
meet in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina's early success has surprised Wright. At last weekend's Section Relays, 
Wright was thinking top five and the Vikings finished second to powerhouse 
Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps give us an idea of our depth," said Wright, who could easily have 
been talking about the Marina girls' team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marina girls matched the boys' 4-0 record with a 123-46 victory over 
Foothill. For the Vikings, who swept the top three spots in four events, Alison 
Mijares, Kristi Rietzel and Adrienne Leight were double individual and double 
relay winners. Mijares easily won the 50-yard (25.07 seconds) and 100-yard 
(55.07) freestyles, Rietzel handily won the 200 (1:58.89) and 500 freestyles 
((5:14.53) and Leight took home firsts in the 200 individual medley (2:15.71) 
and 100 breaststroke (1:12.46). 
</P>
<P>
 For the boys, Stever O'Rourke was the only individual double-event winner. 
O'Rourke won the 200 free (1:52.26) over teammate Spencer Miller by four 
seconds and his 4:59.85 in the 500 free was 14 seconds faster than Foothill's 
Brian Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foothill had some personnel shortages of its own. Water polo standout 
David Hay broke a leg two months ago and dipped his toe in a pool for the first 
time last week. Teammate David Katz, who is headed for the same junior national 
meet, has had some shoulder problems and was limited to one event -- he won the 
100 breast (1:01.36). 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill fell to 1-2, but its other loss was to reputable El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some tough competition. I think we gave them a pretty good run," 
Foothill Coach Dave Simcox said. "But they're real, they have a lot of depth." 
</P>
<P>
 Marina won six events to Foothill's five, but it was that deep bench, a Viking 
trademark, that hurt the Knights. Marina took first and second in two events 
and swept the 200 IM. 
</P>
<P>
 "That hurt us," Simcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague boys' swimming: 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 118, Fullerton 51 -- Junior Jeff Hamilton, a double winner in the 200 
(2:00.53) and 500 freestyle (5:24.3), was also on two of the winning relays for 
Canyon (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague girls' swimming: 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 131, Fullerton 38 -- Freshman Laurie Osuna was a double winner in the 
50 freestyle (26.8) and the 100 backstroke (1:12.8) for visiting Canyon (4-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos 106, La Serna 60 -- Adrienne Paradiese won the 200 freestyle 
(2:02.22) and 50 freestyle (26.16) and anchored victories in the 200 medley and 
200 freestyle relays and Tatum Schubert won the 100 butterfly (1:01.78) and 100 
backstroke (1:04.50) to lead visiting Los Alamitos (3-0).

STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; ROUNDUP; PLAYA DEL REY ST. BERNARD GETS A 
SECOND TITLE

<P>
 No matter that the Playa del Rey St. Bernard girls' basketball team lost four 
of its five starters from last season's State Division IV championship team 
because of graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter because the player the Vikings had returning was Olympia Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott led St. Bernard to its second consecutive title when it defeated Grass 
Valley Bear River, 53-43, Friday at the Oakland Coliseum in a rematch of last 
season's final. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, a 6-foot-2 senior forward, and Marte Alexander, a 6-4 senior center, 
each scored 14 points to lead the Vikings (28-4). Scott also had a game-high 20 
rebounds, including nine offensive boards. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard did not take control until the fourth quarter. With St. Bernard 
trailing, 43-39, Alexander and Scott combined for 10 points as the Vikings 
scored the final 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 For St. Bernard, the game ended an era. Scott will head to Stanford next 
season and Alexander will head to Arizona. WENDY WITHERSPOON

consecutive Sunset League match with a 15-3, 15-8, 15-0 victory Friday night at

EMPIRE LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; FLORES GETS COMPLETE GAME AS EL DORADO BEATS

<P>
 Benito Flores looked forward to the meeting for more than 10 months and he 
would not accept another loss. 
</P>
<P>
 So when things began unraveling around the El Dorado High pitcher against 
Cypress, Flores did what he promised himself he would: He took charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior left-hander worked out of a sixth-inning jam and pitched a complete 
game in leading El Dorado to a 4-1 victory in an Empire League baseball opener 
Friday at El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores (2-1) pitched a five-hitter and struck out seven for El Dorado (6-2, 
1-0 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching with a 4-0 lead entering the sixth, Flores gave up three hits and 
Cypress' only run when the Centurions' leadoff hitter, senior Ray Rios (three 
for three), scored on a one-out single by junior first baseman Brian Flanagan. 
Flanagan took second on a passed ball to give Cypress runners on second and 
third, but Flores ended the threat by striking out the next two batters. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was especially gratifying for Flores and El Dorado because Cypress 
(4-3, 0-1) defeated El Dorado, 4-2, in the final game of the 1993 regular 
season, which kept the Golden Hawks out of the playoffs for only the third time 
in 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took it personal; we all did," Flores said. "We all thought about this game 
every time we went to practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress senior right-hander Tim Larsen (1-2) was the winner in last season's 
showdown. Larsen pitched a complete game Friday, but he did not have his best 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three hitters in the Golden Hawks' lineup (Ryan Reyes, Chris Beck 
and Jeff Moore) each were two for three. Beck, a junior third baseman, scored 
El Dorado's first run in the bottom of the first when senior right fielder 
Dante Spencer grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Hawks scored three runs in the third inning to take control. 
Moore's second home run of the season, which traveled approximately 360 feet 
and landed over the fence in right-center field, also drove in Beck. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos 5, Loara 3 (6, darkness) -- Myles Campbell struck out nine in 5 
1/3 innings for the visiting Griffins. Catcher Mark Ukleja hit a two-run homer 
in the third and Kevin Feterik went two for three with a double and a run 
scored for Los Alamitos (4-3, 1-0). Jeff Roncevich (1-2) took the loss for 
Loara (3-4, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Katella 6, Esperanza 2 -- Jaret Wright pitched a three-hitter, striking out 
10, and homered for visiting Katella (3-3, 1-0). Esperanza is 3-4, 0-1.

IRVINE'S WET SEAL LOSES $2.3 MILLION FOR PERIOD, PROMOTES 2 EXECUTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wet Seal Inc., the young women's fashion apparel chain, promoted two senior 
executives Friday as it released annual results showing it lost $2.3 million 
primarily because of poor fourth-quarter sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Bronstein, who has been the company's president, now becomes vice 
chairwoman. She retains her role as chief executive officer, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 She is being replaced as president by Edmond Thomas, who was previously 
executive vice president. He retains his additional title of chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Irv Teitelbaum said in announcing the changes that the "new 
appointments give appropriate recognition to their dynamic co-managerial 
roles." 
</P>
<P>
 The promotions came despite the losses, which an analyst said reflect the poor 
performance of the industry last year and not just Irvine-based Wet Seal. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, Wet Seal's losses amounted to 19 cents a 
share, compared to earnings of $3.6 million, or 29 cents a share, for the 
previous fiscal year. Revenue was also down, to $140.1 million, off 6.4% from 
last year's $149.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wet Seal closed Friday at $4 a share, down 25 cents, in trading on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronstein blamed the loss on "cautious spending habits" by junior apparel 
customers in the fourth quarter. She noted, too, that "the extensive 
'grunge'-related fashion looks offered by the company were poorly received" and 
that "holiday sales were very disappointing, requiring heavy promotional 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-quarter losses amounted to $1.6 million, or 13 cents a share, compared 
to a loss of $410,000, or 3 cents a share, in the same period last year. Sales 
were $34.54 million, down 2.6% from sales of $35.48 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Tashjian an analyst for the investment banking firm of First Manhattan Co. 
in New York, said he thinks Wet Seal "did a good job in 1993 in restructuring 
management and bringing in some very strong people. They also did a reasonably 
good job of getting rid of some under-performing or losing stores." 
</P>
<P>
 (In the past year, the company gained new directors of sales and information 
systems and a new chief financial officer. Others saw their titles shuffled as 
part of the reorganization.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the earnings disappointments, Tashjian said Wet Seal enters the year 
with a strong balance sheet, a ready reserve of cash and plans to expand in the 
New York area, where its first store in the Staten Island Mall may become one 
of the chain's top performers. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain continues to be penalized by having so many stores in Southern 
California, which is recovering more slowly from recession than the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Wet Seal now has 130 stores in California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii, Florida, 
Texas, Georgia, Louisiana and New York. It opened 10 new stores in 1993 and 
closed five others. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its losses for the year reflect the store closings, as well 
the impact of the Northridge earthquake on 10 stores, including two that remain 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, the company appointed three executives to newly created vice 
president positions. Ann Cadier Kim, chief financial officer, has been promoted 
to vice president of finance; Marc R. Bertone, director of real estate and 
general counsel, has become the vice president of real estate; and Sharon 
Hughes, the divisional merchandising manager, adds the title of vice president 
of merchandising.

CHINA'S TRADE STATUS DICEY, BENTSEN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China would probably lose its most-favored-nation trade privileges with the 
United States if a decision were made now, despite the harm such a move could 
cause American business, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, speaking during a stop in Los Angeles on his way to a meeting of 
Asian-Pacific finance ministers in Honolulu today, said the United States must 
balance its interests between fostering free trade and promoting human rights 
in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington must avoid "giving the competition an advantage" by curtailing 
U.S.-China commerce, he said, but added that China's failure to make progress 
on human rights puts its status in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the decision was made today, I'd assume China would lose its MFN 
privileges," Bentsen said. "We have until June, and we hope to work it out by 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 The remark came after the debacle of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
human rights mission to Beijing one week ago, when a number of political 
dissidents were jailed to stop them from trying to meet Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials on both sides engaged in a vitriolic exchange, leaving China's 
continued trade privileges in serious doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Most-favored-nation trading status allows nations to export to the U.S. market 
under normal, low tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all U.S. trading partners have MFN status; notable exceptions are 
Iraq and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Because China is not a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
its MFN status is not automatic and must be renewed on an annual basis. Last 
June, President Clinton renewed the privilege on the condition that Beijing 
make "significant progress" in human rights if it wanted another extension this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic consequences of denying MFN to China are not clear. Beijing has 
warned that such a move could backfire and hurt U.S. interests more than its 
own, because China's double-digit economic growth increasingly relies on 
domestic demand and intra-Asia trade. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hong Kong, which serves as a conduit for a large portion of U.S.-China 
trade, stands to lose as much as $24 billion in annual trade if China's MFN 
status is rescinded, the colony's Trade Department said in a report released 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, addressing a breakfast meeting sponsored by Town Hall Los Angeles, 
said he hopes to "build some communication and some trust" when he meets today 
in Honolulu with the finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights, however, is a taboo subject for the 17-member regional group, a 
diverse and loosely structured organization that has avoided contentious issues 
for the sake of maintaining a fragile consensus since it was founded in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen appeared unlikely to discuss MFN with his Chinese counterpart, Liu 
Zhongli, or talk tough with Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii about 
trade tensions between Tokyo and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, Bentsen was not scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with either 
delegate, a Treasury Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't plan to go in and twist arms and bully people around," Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was scheduled to meet one-on-one with Malaysian Finance Minister Anwar 
Ibrahim in Hawaii, an encounter that will probably touch on the most immediate 
problem facing APEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia has been a strident opponent of strengthening the organization, while 
the United States and Australia have been pushing the group toward a 
policy-making role that might include sponsoring a regional free-trade 
arrangement in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad rejected an invitation from Clinton 
to join other Asian leaders at an APEC summit in Seattle last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahathir advocates an alternative Asian trade grouping, the East Asian 
Economic Caucus, which excludes the United States, Australia, New Zealand and 
Chile -- all APEC members -- on the grounds that they are not Asian nations.

CLINTON-GREENSPAN MEETING DRIVES UP BOND YIELDS; MARKETS: TALK GENERATES 
EXPECTATION THAT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES ARE ABOUT TO BE BOOSTED. DOW AVERAGE 
FINISHES 30.51 HIGHER IN THIRD-HEAVIEST TRADING DAY IN HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A hastily convened meeting Friday between President Clinton and Federal 
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan at the White House sent bond market 
yields higher and generated broad expectation that the central bank will raise 
short-term interest rates at a key policy meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a late buying surge related to the expiration of futures and 
options contracts swept the Dow Jones industrial average sharply higher during 
one of the busiest sessions ever on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides insisted there was nothing unusual about Friday's meeting. There 
was "agreement that the fundamentals on the economy still seem sound," Clinton 
aide Gene Sperling told reporters. "They did not discuss interest rate policy," 
he added, and Clinton didn't tell Greenspan whether he thinks the Fed should 
raise interest rates again in an effort to keep high inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that Greenspan canceled a longstanding speaking engagement in 
Houston for the one-hour audience with the President kicked Wall Street's rumor 
mill into overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Many market observers speculated that Clinton summoned Greenspan to the White 
House in a last-ditch effort to stop him from raising short-term interest rates 
at Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's 
main policy board. 
</P>
<P>
 Others theorized that Greenspan initiated the meeting to warn Clinton that he 
planned a substantial rate hike at the committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Both theories gave markets the willies. At the end of trading Friday, the 
yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond had risen to 6.90% from 6.82% the day 
before. Stocks also recoiled early in the day before closing higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed last engineered a rise in short-term rates Feb. 4, when it boosted the 
federal funds rate a quarter of a pointfor the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's White House meeting was "a big mistake," said Charles Leiberman, 
managing director at Chemical Securities Inc. He said Greenspan now must raise 
short-term rates at least a quarter of a percent at next week's FOMC meeting to 
maintain his credibility in financial markets. Anything less, he said, "will 
give the impression that Greenspan's arm can be twisted by the Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, after hovering at modestly lower to higher levels throughout the 
day, the blue chip average jumped near the close of trading to finish up 30.51 
points at 3,895.65, giving it a gain for the week of 32.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market gauges also advanced in the late going, but less impressively 
than the Dow industrials did. The New York Stock Exchange composite index added 
0.24, closing at 261.35, which was up 2.82 from a week earlier. The Standard & 
Poor's 500 index rose 0.16 to 471.06 and added 4.62 in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The buying wave also carried smaller stocks aloft. The Nasdaq's composite 
index managed to dig out of a deficit and edge 0.08 past its previous record 
set Thursday to 803.93. The Russell 2,000, which tracks smaller capitalization 
stocks, finished at its third new high in a row at 271.08, up 1.29. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called triple witching, the quarterly expirations of futures, stock 
index options and options on individual stocks, boosted volume on the New York 
Stock Exchange to 462.24 million shares, the third-heaviest total on record, 
and added to the market's volatility. On Thursday, 303.95 million shares 
changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the heavy buying, declining issues held a slight edge over advances on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Weakness in stocks overseas also weighed on the market. Hong Kong's Hang Seng 
index plunged 380.82 points, or 4%, to 9,132.31, as institutions dumped blue 
chips and small investors joined the selling spree amid persistent interest 
rate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, selling by some institutional investors pushed the 225-share Nikkei 
average down 122.71 points to 20,469.45. Germany's DAX index closed at 
2,155.61, down 19.45 points on the day, while London's Financial Times 
100-share average dropped 37.6 points to 3,218.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century Industries fell 3 5/8 to 51 1/2 following news it would take a 
big first-quarter charge related to claims from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northwest Airlines made its debut on the Nasdaq, where it took top billing 
on the actives list. It closed at 13, the same as its initial price. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Electric gained 1 1/2 to 104 1/2. Late Thursday, an uninvited 
$2.2-billion takeover bid by General Electric's GE Capital unit made for 
financial services concern Kemper was rejected by Kemper's board. Kemper was 
unchanged at 60 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fears of higher interest rates were reflected in financial stocks. Citicorp 
sank 1 3/4 to 39 1/4 in heavy NYSE turnover of more than 34.8 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 * RJR Nabisco, parent of R.J. Reynolds, rose 1/4 to 6 5/8 after Kidder Peabody 
upgraded the stock to a trading buy from neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 * King World Productions added 2 1/8 to 39. The company reportedly reached an 
agreement with Oprah Winfrey to continue distributing her top-rated talk show 
through the 1999-2000 television season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Micron Technology rose 5 1/4 to 88 1/2 on heavy volume of more than 1.4 
million shares after CS First Boston raised its earnings estimates for fiscal 
1994 and 1995 on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monk-Austin rose 2 5/8 to 18 1/2. The company said it agreed to buy tobacco 
for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in the U.S. auction markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond plunged 27/32 point, or $8.44 per $1,000 in 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Chan, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities 
Inc., said the Fed will probably raise the federal funds rate, the rate on 
overnight loans between banks, by a quarter of a percentage point. On Friday, 
the rate closed at 3.188%. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Clinton-Greenspan meeting sent gold prices soaring. 
Gold's rally further depressed bond prices. The metal is bought as a hedge 
against inflation.

JAPAN MET GOAL ON FOREIGN CHIPS IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States' roller-coaster trade relationship with Japan tentatively 
moved into an upswing Friday, with the disclosure that Japanese industries 
purchased slightly more than 20% of their semiconductors from foreign suppliers 
during the final three months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign share of the market, a gain of more than two percentage points 
over the previous quarter, returns Japan to compliance with an informal target 
established with the United States in 1986 and renewed in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Japanese have hit the 20% target, intended to increase U.S. access to 
the Japanese computer market, only once in the past, and U.S. officials said 
the recent purchase level must be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 The semiconductor agreement is unrelated to the more contentious and 
unresolved questions surrounding the broad scope of U.S.-Japanese trade that 
are encompassed in the stalled "framework" talks, which fell apart five weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan objected to the Clinton Administration's insistence that objective 
criteria be established to measure increases in U.S. access to the Japanese 
market for automobiles and auto parts, medical equipment, telecommunications 
equipment and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. trade officials took the progress being eked out by foreign 
manufacturers of semiconductors as a sign of positive movement and one that 
suggests Japanese government and industry are not strictly obstructionist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows (that) when they put their minds to it, things really happen," a 
senior U.S. trade official said. "Hopefully, it bodes well for a major proposal 
at the end of the month." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has said it will produce a plan by the end of March to get the framework 
talks back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. trade representative's office announced that Japanese companies 
purchased 20.7% of their semiconductors -- the microcircuits that are the heart 
of computer technology -- from foreign producers during the final quarter of 
1993. During the previous quarter, the figure was 18.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Semiconductor Industry Assn. in San Jose said the improved fourth-quarter 
report brought the yearly average to 19.4%, an increase of two percentage 
points over 1992. Roughly 85% of Japan's foreign-made computer chips were 
manufactured in the United States, according to Kevin Brett, a spokesman for 
the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the Senate Finance international trade 
subcommittee, said the figures released Friday prove that "setting benchmarks 
and applying pressure does work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Japan seems to play by the rules only when the referee is 
watching," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the breakdown of the framework talks, the Clinton Administration has 
tried, step by step, to increase pressure on Tokyo, announcing earlier this 
month that it was reinstating a provision in U.S. trade law that would allow it 
to eventually impose sanctions on Japan for unfair trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, meanwhile, the trade minister rejected U.S. pressure for the 
government to guarantee his nation's auto makers' plans to increase imports of 
U.S.-made parts. Horoshi Kumagai also was reported to have said that he favors 
getting rid of the voluntary limits Japan has placed on its exports of 
automobiles to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has the U.S. government shown any appreciation for our efforts on earlier 
voluntary export restraints? No," Kumagai said to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 At its center, the dispute between the two nations is over the size of the 
Japanese trade surplus with the United States -- $59.3 billion last year -- and 
over the difficulty U.S. companies have had in selling their products and 
services in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 semiconductor agreement is just one of the government-to-government 
pacts intended to pry open the Japanese market.

DAY RUNNER STOCK HITS 52-WEEK HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Day Runner Inc.'s shares sprinted to a 52-week high Friday after an analyst 
predicted that the company's new student-oriented product line would enjoy a 
strong debut.In heavy trading on the Nasdaq, Day Runner stock closed at $17.50, 
up $2.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia L. Allen, an analyst with San Francisco-based brokerage Montgomery 
Securities, said retailers' enthusiasm for Day Runner's new line of organizers 
will have a "significant positive impact" on the company's year-end earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "411," a slang term among teens for information, the line marks the 
company's first products geared specifically toward adolescents. It will be 
available to consumers this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Fullerton, Day Runner makes loose-leaf organizers traditionally aimed 
at business people.

sentiment on the future and current conditions. The index for consumer 
expectations rose to 84.9 in March from 83.5 in February. However, consumer 
sentiment on current economic conditions dropped to 103.4 from 108.3.

 Whittle Plans to Close Book Division: Whittle Communications will close its 
book publishing operations, which have failed to obtain sufficient advertising 
commitments for the next fiscal year, executives confirmed.The decision follows 
the recent shutdown of its Special Report Network, which involved video 
programs, magazines, posters and brochures that helped advertisers reach people 
in medical waiting rooms. Both closures reflect the Knoxville, Tenn.-based 
company's decision to focus on electronic rather than print media. Whittle's 
main properties are its Channel One TV news program for schools and a Medical 
News Network TV service for physicians, to premiere this fall.

 Grumman Review Pleases Northrop: After a review of additional Grumman Corp. 
financial data, Northrop Corp. Chairman Kent Kresa said he is more convinced 
than ever that the two defense contractors would make a great 
combination.Northrop last week made an unsolicited bid for Grumman, one of the 
most venerable names in the defense industry, at $60 a share, or about $2.04 
billion. A few days earlier, Grumman had accepted a bid from Martin Marietta 
Corp. at $55 a share, a total of about $1.87 billion. The question now is 
whether Martin Marietta will start a bidding war by raising its offer. Los 
Angeles-based Northrop produces the stealth bomber and other aircraft.

 King World Renews 'Oprah Winfrey' Contract: After months of increasing 
speculation, King World Productions said it renewed its contract to distribute 
"The Oprah Winfrey Show" through the 1999-2000 TV season."Oprah" accounts for 
more than a third of King World's revenue, and a failure to renew the top-rated 
talk show would have been a severe blow to the company. Under the new contract, 
Winfrey may receive options for 1.5 million shares of King World stock on top 
of the million she already controls. In addition, she has the option to take 
over production of the show for the latter term of the contract.

 Northwest Stock Holds at $13 a Share: Northwest Airlines stock held steady 
Friday, the first day shares of the company have been traded publicly since a 
1989 leveraged buyout.Northwest shares closed at $13 on the Nasdaq, unchanged 
from their offering price. On Thursday, Northwest sold 20 million shares to 
investors. The $13-per-share price was about $7 less than originally planned. 
After underwriting fees, the offering will mean nearly $250 million for 
Northwest, which plans to use the money to pay down debt incurred in the 1989 
buyout. Northwest has been making money recently, but it narrowly avoided a 
bankruptcy filing last year.

ALONZO KING'S INTERSECTING LINES; DANCE: THE CHOREOGRAPHER, WHOSE TROUPE IS AT 
THE IRVINE BARCLAY THEATRE TONIGHT, IS INTERESTED IN WHAT UNITES PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Don't ask choreographer Alonzo King to describe what his ballets look like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't describe movements," he insists. "For me, that's appearance stuff. My 
obsession is getting behind appearances to the essence of something. It's just 
like when you meet people: It's not about how they look; it's about, do I trust 
this person? Is there sincerity there? Is there something we have in common?" 
</P>
<P>
 King brings LINES Contemporary Ballet, his 13-member, San Francisco-based 
troupe, to the Irvine Barclay Theatre tonight. The performance is part of the 
Feet First Contemporary Dance Series presented by Irvine Barclay and UC Irvine 
Cultural Events. 
</P>
<P>
 A popular, widely known ballet teacher as well as choreographer and former 
dancer, King founded the small but respected company in 1982. Since then, many 
of his works have been acquired by such noted organizations as the Frankfurt 
and Joffrey ballets. 
</P>
<P>
 While King won't characterize his kinesthetic style -- except to say that it's 
"right now," of the "moment" -- dance critics credit him for breaking ballet's 
rigid boundaries and for his use of unorthodox, abstract steps and group 
formations. 
</P>
<P>
 Times dance writer Lewis Segal in 1992 wrote that King adds "a torso-driven, 
Afro-centric impetus to the linear, pose-oriented European ballet vocabulary." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An immediately personable, albeit strong-minded man, King, who declined to 
give his age, happily discusses the "essence" of his dances, such as 
"Compelling Geological Evidence." The major new work, completed last year, will 
be danced here along with "Bach Cello Suite," set to Bach's music. 
</P>
<P>
 "CGE," as he calls it, has been mistakenly interpreted as a ballet about 
earthquakes. Rather, he said during a recent phone interview from his San 
Francisco home, it's about a scientific search -- akin to his own philosophical 
quest -- for the deeper truths hidden beneath facades. 
</P>
<P>
 In "CGE," King brings East Indian scientist Chandra Bose to life in the form 
of a dancer wearing a hard hat with a miner's lamp attached. Bose, King said, 
asserted that there is not a single "inanimate object on the planet" and that 
even rocks, like plants, animals and human beings, contain "vibrancy and life 
and history." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bose invented the crescograph," King said, "which illuminated the life behind 
what we term inanimate objects, and revealed, for instance, that metal has a 
point of exhaustion, and that plants have emotional life." 
</P>
<P>
 The scientist further contended that this pervasive life force connects all 
things, another idea that's in sync with King's credo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the things that unite us and what we have in common that interest me," 
he said, explaining that the word lines in his troupe's name alludes to this 
uniting "lineage." 
</P>
<P>
 King espouses his tenets at the San Francisco Institute of Choreography, a 
company school he established in 1989. Another notion he said he puts forth 
there is that art is not optional, but "a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we think of choreography as the arrangement of mass designed for visual 
comfort, rather than determined by the logic of a given content, we are saying 
that the purpose of art is to please, that art is a luxury. No. It should 
inform, enlighten, open doors. If it's not useful, what's the point of it?" 
</P>
<P>
 King, born in Alberta, Ga., studied at top ballet schools in New York City 
before brief dancing stints in the '70s and early '80s with such troupes as the 
Dance Theatre of Harlem, the defunct Inner City Repertory, run by UC Irvine 
professor Donald McKayle (King will be in residency at UC Irvine in late May) 
and the Bella Lewitzky Dance Company. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits Lewitzky, who gives all students teacher training, for his 
induction into teaching, through which he met dancers around the world. They, 
in turn, recommended him to the troupe artistic directors who have acquired his 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewitzky, in a recent phone conversation, described King as "a phenomenal 
dancer, and the way in which he put movement together was always fascinating to 
me. He was original, inventive, quite something of his own." 
</P>
<P>
 King, who said his father was a civil rights leader who worked and traveled 
with Malcolm X, is grateful to his parents for the way they influenced his 
attitude about life and art. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were incredibly beautiful, open, honest people who lived with 
conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 He bristles somewhat at the question of whether being an African American has 
also influenced his work, again stressing the superficiality of appearances. 
But he doesn't deny it has had a impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think all day long about the fact that I'm a man, or a black -- those 
are all appearances. But from those appearances, there is information," he 
said. "Experiencing prejudice, that's information, and I'm interested in 
getting the best information from all cultures and experiences." 
</P>

ART REVIEW; THE TWO LIVES OF GRONK; THE LACMA EXHIBITION SHOWS HOW THE ARTIST 
BEGAN HIS CAREER AS AN ANTI-ART REBEL, BUT LATER TURNED TO A MAINSTREAM 
PAINTING STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it possible for an artist to begin a career in a determined anti-art mode, 
which spits out absurdist and confrontational gestures against the failures of 
bourgeois society, and then to switch successfully into a form that is steeped 
in conservative tradition? 
</P>
<P>
 That question is at the heart of "Gronk! A Living Survey, 1973-1993," a 
smallish exhibition that opened Thursday at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art. The show was organized by Rene Yanez, curator of the Mexican Museum in San 
Francisco, where it had its debut last summer. It cleaves into two parts. 
</P>
<P>
 First is an assembly of artifacts, souvenirs, drawings, sketchbooks and 
mementos from Gronk's earliest involvement with street theater, mural painting, 
performance and Conceptual art in the 1970s. Next come about two dozen 
Expressionist paintings in oil or acrylic, as well as a few drawings and 
prints, which the L.A.-based artist has been making since 1984. Connections 
between the two periods are easy to draw, but only the earlier is of sustaining 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Gronk -- he was born Glugio Nicandro in 1954 -- began to make art as a member 
of the rambunctious Chicano collective, ASCO, founded in 1972. Together with 
Harry Gamboa Jr., Willie Herron and Patssi Valdez, he participated in a variety 
of boisterous activities that partook of a renewed interest in Dadaist art 
common among American and European artists of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 ASCO is a Spanish word for disgust, loathing or nausea. The snappy 
capitalization of the group's name made it wickedly redolent of commercial 
corporate logos -- sort of ACME with a hangover. Inspired in part by the 
contemporaneous spirit of the Chicano civil rights movement, Pop art, anti-war 
activism, feminism, post-Stonewall gay liberation and other complex currents of 
the day, the artists brought Zurich Dada of the late-1910s to 1970s Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Photographs in the exhibition's two jam-packed display cases suggest how, in 
mocking recognition of the near invisibility of Latino life in Hollywood 
products, movies were conceived, written, directed and acted out in the streets 
-- albeit without the otherwise essential use of movie cameras or film. Other 
pictures show a heavily made-up Valdez pinned to highway retaining walls with 
industrial tape, creating a sly and resonant mix: She's part "talking mural," 
in homage to the Mexican tradition of painted walls that speak to passers-by, 
and part community representative held in bondage by the culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Among ASCO's earliest, simplest and most devastating actions was to illegally 
spray-paint the collective's name on the entrance doors to the County Museum of 
Art. Thus tagged, the artistic legacy of the mainstream as represented by the 
museum was deftly claimed as their inviolable turf. 
</P>
<P>
 The artifacts in the exhibition's display cases create a fascinating time 
capsule of a lively and inventive moment. Disappointingly, the show's slim and 
boosterish catalogue does little to chronicle this significant history -- and 
Gronk's specific role in it -- in any but a cursory way; nor does it offer much 
sense of how and why the group began to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But unravel it did. By the early 1980s the artists of ASCO had gone their 
separate ways; in 1984 Gronk began to paint. 
</P>
<P>
 He had of course painted before, but not quite in the way he does now -- which 
is to say, in the typical, gallery-bound format of oil or acrylic on canvas, 
and in a painterly style of simplified, posterish images. The date of this 
sudden move is instructive. For painting, after a long hiatus, had by then 
definitively returned to the art-world's international center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 American, Italian and, especially, German Neo-expressionism were fueling a 
newly explosive art market, while the first U.S. exhibitions of the decisive 
German branch had been prominently displayed in Southern California. The L.A. 
art scene, relatively moribund during Gronk's earliest years, now claimed a new 
Museum of Contemporary Art and a rash of new commercial galleries, and was on 
its way to capturing a place in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Gronk's switch to a mainstream painting style doesn't feel like a cynical 
repudiation of ASCO's earlier aims. As a scan of the sketchbooks shows, such 
images as a dark-haired woman in a back-less dress and seen from behind 
(Valdez?) even carry over into similarly themed paintings. Gronk's most common 
subject is a rear view of an anonymous, theatrically garbed woman gesticulating 
before an open window. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Gronk seems to be painting as if his canvases are meant as a kind of 
mis en scene -- portable murals -- to decorate the raucous new theater of an 
expansive art world. His pictures of lone women contemplating painted 
rectangular vistas mimic the artist's (and the viewer's) place and action 
before the painting itself, while 1984's "Cabin Fever" is a satirical depiction 
of a black-tie, cocktail-party crowd, which mirrors the familiar sight of 
upscale revelers at an art exhibition opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Other apparently autobiographical paintings are also on view. But Gronk's 
embrace of an old-fashioned style -- standard emotive Expressionism -- makes 
for pretty routine stuff. The pictures, absent the sometimes razor-sharp edge 
of his youthfully incursive Dadaism, seem to want to merge private 
introspection with social commentary in an effort to represent identity. The 
result is painting as a merely stylish mask.

RICK DU BROW: . . . IN CHARLES WE TRUST; WHEN KURALT GOES ON THE ROAD 
PERMANENTLY THIS SPRING, CBS AND ITS VIEWERS WILLLOSE A SPECIAL BIT OF 
AMERICANA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He certainly never fit the image of a TV news celebrity. He was balding and 
plump and his delivery had a pensive flavor that bordered on the somber. Oh, he 
could -- and did -- cover the big stories, but his specialty was quirky, warm 
little human features that touched America's heart and somehow reassured 
viewers that not everything was wars and shootouts and rotten politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Charles Kuralt, in the prime of his career at 59, surprisingly 
announced his retirement from CBS this week, there was an immediate sense of 
loss because, when you think of it, he may very well be, along with Ted Koppel, 
the most trusted person in network television news, a mantle once held by 
Walter Cronkite. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust was built by two series that were totally out of the mainstream of 
blockbuster TV news programming -- "On the Road," a collection of Americana 
vignettes that ran on the "CBS Evening News" for more than 20 years beginning 
in 1967, and "Sunday Morning," a weekly, unhurried look at the world around us, 
including the arts, nature and music, which marked its 15th anniversary last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuralt's final appearance as host of "Sunday Morning" has been scheduled for 
the Easter broadcast April 3. He officially leaves the company May 1: "I need 
some time to put 37 years worth of stuff into boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview from New York, Kuralt easily remembered the very first 
"On the Road" piece. It was simply about the beauty of autumn in New England: 
"I had the conceit that we could just go up north, go anywhere and find a 
story. I said, 'Just look at the beauty we've been remarking on the last few 
days. That's a story right there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kuralt and his crew roamed the country in a van that came to be known by 
television viewers far and wide. This week, he said, "Somebody who read about 
my retiring called up offering to buy the bus." That, of course, would be a 
mistake. It belongs in the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter irony is that, in the current climate of in-your-face TV news, 
pushed more and more by nasty reality shows into the arena of hard-bitten 
cynicism, a soft feature like "On the Road" would probably never get on the 
air, let alone on a network evening news broadcast. Kuralt, you see, was 
serving another valuable function -- bringing trust to TV at a time when the 
public is casting an ever-skeptical eye on the media. He gave the lie to the 
belief that good news is no news. 
</P>
<P>
 He is leaving, he says, because he wants to write a book about America, 
because he has done just about everything he wants in the news business and 
because he wants to embark on new ventures while he is in good health and 
spirits: 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the notion of being footloose in America again for my book. The idea 
of sticking a notebook in my pocket and talking to people without the 
encumbrances of television lights and cameras is something I'd like to try for 
a while." 
</P>
<P>
 He is not, he says, leaving because of the hard-edged changes in TV news, 
although in the past he criticized the growing importance of marketing of 
network journalism: "I can't say I'm happy with every single direction TV news 
has taken over the years, but none of them ever affected me. No one ever asked 
me to lower my standards." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he and CBS executives say that the network wanted him to stay. "They 
meant it," says Kuralt. "I had a couple of long, friendly talks with my bosses 
and they were really trying to find a way to avoid a complete break. They 
wanted me to stay here in some capacity. And they really did say, 'You can come 
back any time you want to.' " 
</P>
<P>
 If Kuralt was not in the flashy, glamour category of other network names, it 
was because, in part, of his choice of direction. He was a top-flight 
correspondent who reported straight events throughout the world, "but I learned 
that I did not enjoy covering major events. I didn't enjoy the competitive and 
deadline pressure. But I found I did enjoy going to political conventions and 
political summits and the Olympics and doing sidebars." 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, he did those sidebars from the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, 
Norway, but he says he would have hated being "one of the horde of reporters 
covering Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan" and preferred "poking around" 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 He discovered his bent in the reporting business, he says, while covering 
Latin America more than three decades ago: "I seemed to have a knot in my 
stomach because I knew NBC was going to beat me on the story." But it was not 
just that single experience. He felt that "knot" because "I discovered that by 
temperament and physique and ability, I would never be a Mike Wallace; I would 
never be a tiger of a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got a note from Mike (who is 75) saying that he's happy for me but 
that he couldn't imagine himself doing what I'm doing (retiring). He needs that 
daily shot of adrenaline." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuralt notes that in his years at CBS, the few assignments that he did turn 
down included "saying no to '60 Minutes' a couple of times." He was happy doing 
"On the Road." He did not, he says, want to do stories where "you stick your 
nose in and ask embarrassing questions. That's a craven admission. But it's not 
one of the things I want to do. In the TV scheme of things, my projects are not 
important, but they are important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 What was great about CBS News over the years, of course, is that it had both 
Wallace and the "60 Minutes" crew and, on the other hand, a Charles Kuralt. But 
now, even the heirs to the dynasty that Murrow and Cronkite helped build are 
bound to be heading in different directions, with Kuralt leaving, Wallace and 
some of the other "60 Minutes" gang getting up there in age, and the new image 
represented by anchors Dan Rather and Connie Chung. 
</P>
<P>
 When "On the Road," which dribbled to a halt several years ago, was in its 
heyday, Kuralt had perhaps the best job in television. Driving around the 
country, he was often unreachable by his bosses in New York. Cellular phones 
had not yet taken hold: "We did have a mobile phone on the bus, but it worked 
very uncertainly. It was for outgoing calls. Part of the deal was that I would 
never get an assignment -- they could make a suggestion, but I would do all my 
own stories." 
</P>
<P>
 I called him once for an interview while he was on the road, and the procedure 
went like this: You left your name and number with his secretary in New York. 
Kuralt would call in periodically for messages. He got mine and called me back 
from a roadside in the Midwest. We spoke for half an hour, and all the time I 
could hear the trucks and cars whizzing by on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was the other, often-overlooked side to Kuralt's career: He was 
perhaps the most valuable utility player at CBS News. Need a nightly news sub? 
Call Charles. Need a host for the old "Morning" series in the early 1980s? Call 
Charles. He didn't really have to prove himself anymore, but he got up about 1 
or 2 in the morning to get to that job early so he could write his own 
material: 
</P>
<P>
 "I (hosted) that show alone for a while, and then I did it with Diane Sawyer, 
and then they kicked me off and kept Diane on and I went back on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 He did some prime-time shows as well, including specials, and during the 
Persian Gulf War he suddenly was also called to do late-night, co-hosting a 
brief series with Lesley Stahl titled "America Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "On the Road" had made him a piece of Americana, he was refreshingly 
non-jingoistic as host of the wartime series. One night, for instance, while 
some broadcasters exulted that just one American plane was lost in the early 
hours of the war, Kuralt memorably showed human concern for that single 
casualty, noting glumly: "One of our planes is missing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuralt has been honored by broadcasting's Peabody and Emmy awards. At his 
best, he has been a poet in a medium better known for its rotten gags, lousy 
dialogue and cheap thrill-seeking. Almost as miraculous as the longevity of "On 
the Road" is the fact that "Sunday Morning" still exists, as though programmed 
from a different planet unconcerned with TV's ordinary and very common 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But times are changing, soft TV is a hard sell, and if you ask me, Kuralt is 
getting out and changing course at a very good time. As he once wrote of his 
"On the Road" pieces: "We stick to the back roads, where Kansas still looks 
like Kansas and Georgia still looks like Georgia."

POP BEAT: HAPPY ACCIDENT MAKES IT ALL HAPPEN; JAMES TURNED OUT WEIGHTY MUSIC 
FOR 11 YEARS BUT FINALLY FOUND COMMERCIAL SUCCESS IN THE U.S. WITH THE COMIC 
DITTY 'LAID.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The English band James is headlining the Palace on Monday and Tuesday, 
demonstrating a huge increase in drawing power since last October, when it 
played one night at the Roxy. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? 
</P>
<P>
 "A silly little catchy pop song," says the band's singer Tim Booth, laughing 
at the irony: After turning out a diverse array of fairly weighty music for 11 
years, James has found its commercial footing in the United States with the 
popularity of the title track from the current album "Laid" -- a bouncy, comic 
ditty about a relentless sexual pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been brought up on the kind of maxim that pain is deep, you know," 
Booth said this week by car phone as the group motored south into California. 
"It's a Western false concept. Very English, very European, I think -- 
suffering for your art. And when something comes as easily and as simply as 
'Laid,' you kind of don't take it as seriously as some of the ones that you 
have to bleed for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy with it now. We're very proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Booth calls the song "a happy little accident." The sextet came up with it 
during one of the improvising breaks during its album sessions, then set it 
aside as too "pop." When producer Brian Eno listened to five hours of tapes, he 
singled it out and encouraged the band to polish it up for the album. 
</P>
<P>
 The song might not fit the James image -- and that's exactly the way they like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "James has always been unpredictable," Booth said. "Our fans love that in 
England. They love the fact that every night we play a different set of songs. 
You never know how we're going to be. We can be very moody and difficult; we 
can be very uplifting and joyous.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's something that has been valued in England. But it also means it takes 
longer to become successful, because people find it much harder to pin you 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 James struggled through its first seven years after forming in Manchester in 
1983. Following a major lineup change in 1988, the success of the single "Sit 
Down" moved James to the forefront of the English rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sit Down," an anthem of reassurance and solidarity that became a centerpiece 
of the live shows, bespeaks the group's willingness to shoot for big emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to move people really, and to move them in different ways," said 
Booth, 29. "To upset, to agitate, to uplift, to give people happy endings now 
and again, but not for the whole trip to be a happy ending. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "You know, music is magic. It's like, how can people cry when certain 
instruments and certain rhythms are played in a certain way? Why does it make 
people cry? Why does it make people laugh? It's magic, and we try and keep 
connecting with that spirit of music rather than get sidetracked into any other 
cul-de-sac about power or money or fame." 
</P>
<P>
 That means there weren't any career considerations taken into account when the 
"Laid" album was recorded. With an atmospheric edge provided by producer Eno, 
and with the band in touch with its mellow side after playing 50 acoustic shows 
as Neil Young's opening act, the record is a distinct departure from James' 
previous work -- the kind of record that might confuse the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should confuse our fans," said Booth, laughing. "It's always a 
healthy thing to do. As long as you confuse them with beautiful music then 
that's OK really."

IT'S A PARTY; NO, IT'S WORK; ORCHESTRA: A VIOLINIST SHARES HIS EXPERIENCES AS 
HE AND FELLOW L.A. MUSICIANS PERFORM IN TAIWAN AND JAPAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY TANABE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Tanabe is a violinist with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic traveling in Asia with the orchestra.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Monday, March 14, 1 p.m.: The Hollywood Bowl parking lot. Members of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic gather to board buses to the airport, beginning a 12-day 
concert tour of Taiwan and Japan. As departure time approaches, farewells 
become more resistant; children sensing something ominously familiar about this 
scenario, become quiet and apprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians, meanwhile, have already begun familiar boarding and reboarding 
rituals: Alliances must be established and assured in order to face the 
daunting uncertainty of this recurring "temporary bachelorhood." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Philharmonic, these alliances seem to occur, with some predictability, 
along "sectional" lines. For example, the string bassists maintain as exuberant 
and loyal a camaraderie as any college fraternity. The low brass are drawn 
together by their unquenchable quest for "The Perfect Brew." Violinists seem to 
be unable to shop without the support of other violinists. And our 
percussionists seek one another out to do their mysterious percussion things. 
(There is some trans-sectional fraternizing; however, clef considerations are 
usually maintained.) 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, there is continuous schmoozing during the 14-hour flight. It must 
be bewildering to the "civilian" passengers and to the flight crew that these 
100 people can find so much to talk about and that all of the talk can be so 
relentlessly funny. Suffice it to say that the level of exuberance maintained 
during the potentially deadly flight underlines the conviviality of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Two and a half meals later . . . four showings of "Mrs. Doubtfire" later . . . 
we land in Taipei. It is late Tuesday now. I hear an announcement that seems to 
say, "Pizza of the house . . . oh! oh! Bus," but I'm too tired to decipher. The 
transfer to our hotel rooms is smooth and professional. And most of us choose 
to go directly to bed. Wednesday, March 16 
</P>
<P>
 A Free Day: My first "Chinese meal" consists of bacon and eggs, toast and 
coffee. Esa-Pekka Salonen joins our little covey of string players for 
breakfast and announces that Anja Sofia will be the name of his newest family 
member, born, conveniently, just 10 days prior to the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a hotel in Taiwan, we relive some of our experiences during our 
one-month residency at the 1992 Salzburg Festival. Before we go our separate 
ways, Salonen describes his observations of Japanese orchestras. He finds them 
extraordinarily disciplined and attentive, but he adds: "I kind of missed the 
looser deportment that I encounter in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Following breakfast, our small string band decides to visit the National 
Museum, a Confucius Temple (ablaze with an ongoing carnival/bazaar) and a local 
herb marketplace. We stop for dim-sum and noodles at the mega-grand Grand 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on the recommendation of two of our more adventurous colleagues, we 
decide to visit a "nightmarket" called Snake Alley in the evening. Is there a 
restaurant there? Our hotel concierge scribbles something in Chinese on a card, 
and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Through sign language and expressive pointing, we find ourselves in front of a 
puzzlingly European-style dining room, staring at open-air bins of familiar and 
unfamiliar sea creatures, most of which are moving and twitching. A friendly 
looking man with an apron and one gold tooth makes gestures, smiles and nods. 
We are bewildered. We make gestures, smile and nod and before we know it, we 
are sitting down to a seven-course seafood feast that would have made Kubla 
Khan blush! 
</P>
<P>
 The only discomfort in paying out the $107 per person was the fact that we 
were unable to recognize the species of some of the elegantly presented 
morsels. A waitress obligingly attempts to identify some of our dinner, but, 
because of a single hilarious and potentially pornographic slip in 
interpretation, we decide it is better not to know. 
</P>
<P>
 After perusing some of the extremely local color, we are whisked back to our 
hotel by the "Niccolo Paganini" of taxi drivers: He lunges, veers, skips and 
slides through the Taipei traffic frenzy with a blinding virtuosity that makes 
us teary-eyed. Thursday, March 17 
</P>
<P>
 Workday: Many of the musicians have been practicing in their hotel rooms in 
preparation for today's rehearsal and concert . . .  
</P>
<P>
 First rehearsal. 4 p.m.: There is always an edge of apprehension when entering 
a new hall. True to my fears, I find the stage seating scheme changed, the 
sight lines altered, the lighting and temperature different, and the sound, as 
perceived from my seat, echoey and distant. I am annoyed and disoriented and 
find it difficult to concentrate . . . for the first four minutes. Then, those 
distractions are no longer important, as we are all back in our familiar 
rehearsal mode. At the end of the rehearsal, we play through the Taiwanese 
national anthem, which pulls me back to the reality that we are on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Concert: As I walk onstage at 7:30 p.m. I understand why I was on a plane 
for 14 hours, why I disrupted my life, the meaning behind the exotic meals and 
the necessity of communicating in a foreign land. I am here to accomplish 
something special in these next two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 As on all tour concerts, a certain nervousness, an additional margin of 
earnestness helps us to play with a heightened awareness -- sometimes a new 
freshness. This happened during Bartok's "Concerto for Orchestra" tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 We file offstage, out of sight of the audience. There's a mass collapse. The 
accumulated exhaustion is total and intense. I know, though, that the orchestra 
will ignore this temporary paralysis and go back onstage to perform Beethoven's 
"Seventh Symphony" at the very peak of its capability. Because that's what we 
do.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ETTA JAMES PUMPS INTENSITY INTO TALES OF THE HEART; IN HER 
COACH HOUSE SHOW, THE VETERAN VOCALIST DISPLAYS BOTH POWER AND CONTROL AS SHE 
DELIVERS HER TRADEMARK SONGS OF LOVE ARRIVING AND DEPARTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Go to see Etta James and you get a show about the affairs of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 James knows these matters intimately, and Thursday at the Coach House, she 
sang songs about love arriving, love leaving -- and even sometimes love hanging 
around -- delivering her tunes with feeling and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Employing her potent incantatory alto, James sent her tales across the room 
with such intensity and honesty that even those who had forgotten what love was 
all about might have been reminded. 
</P>
<P>
 James, 56, who has enjoyed a four-decade career in music, is refreshingly 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Coach House, she proved that her instrument -- called "one of the two 
or three deepest, most profound voices in rhythm and blues" by Russell Gersten 
in the "New Rolling Stone Record Guide" -- remains plenty powerful, and her 
gritty shouts carry sufficient strength to massage their way up your spine. 
</P>
<P>
 But she never resorted to the kind of over-the-top histrionics once central to 
her shows; instead, she consistently used soft, full tones to deliver her 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that Etta James has completely let go of what she calls her 
'blues sex queen" image. Rather, it's that she now uses body language to make 
humorous reference to the sexual aspects in some of her songs, and she gets a 
lot of mileage out of her bumps and grinds. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, to begin a hissingly slow take of Randy Newman's "You Can Leave 
Your Hat On," she meandered over to the stool she had been sitting on, bent 
toward stage left and slowly rolled her derriere -- she was wearing a black 
satin lounge robe over black stretch pants -- back and forth. The crowd howled 
with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 At a couple of other junctures, she faced her fans, leaned over, opened her 
robe-coat and squeezed her ample breasts together. She got what she wanted: 
catcalls, guffaws and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, though, James simply sat on her stool and sang. Backed by a 
seven-piece band that gave her a beat as big as boxcar, James offered a relaxed 
tour through her hits, including "At Last," "I'd Rather Go Blind" and "Come to 
Mama." 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, she failed to sing even one tune from her new "Mystery Lady" 
album, which finds her deftly investigating tunes recorded by Billie Holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Last," which James introduced in 1961, offered a perfect example of her 
skillful use of dynamic sonic colors. She began the emotional song softly; at 
the third line -- "My lonely days are over" -- she dropped her voice to an even 
quieter, deeper level. Soon, though, she was building to the first of several 
rousing peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 With the phrase "I've found a thrill to press my cheek to," she dragged the 
"I've" out, repeating it three times, as if she were shaking out a rug in the 
back yard. She closed with the words "and you are mine at last," dropping down 
for the first four words, attacking the "at" with full volume, then stating the 
final "last" with simple directness. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the tender side was "A Love Is Forever." Her accompaniment was 
provided solely by guitarists Josh Sklair and Bobby Murry , and the resulting 
quietude surrounded her as she sang with a misty-voiced intimacy. As she worked 
toward the song's climax, she sang higher-range tones that were quite strong 
but not piercing. 
</P>
<P>
 A good, bubbling beat underpinned several tunes, among them Newman's "Hat," 
which was outfitted with a Stevie Wonder-esque horn part played by trombonist 
Kraig Kilby and trumpeter Ronnie Buttacavoli. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both "I Just Want to Make Love to You" and "Baby, What You Want Me to Do?" -- 
two blues standards -- were driven by rough-and-tumble shuffle grooves that led 
to foot-tapping and head-bobbing from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 James' son Donto, Richard Cousins and Dave Mathews fleshed out the band on 
drums, bass and organ respectively, giving James a solid ballast on which to 
build her renditions. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a drawback to the performance -- besides the missing Billie 
Holiday numbers -- it was that James extended some of her tunes, going into 
long pointless rhythmic vamps and indulging in silly call-and-responses with 
the crowd. In the same space, another telling tune could have been offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist-singer Coco Montoya's blues band opened the show, and although 
Montoya can sing and play, he continually pushed his songs to a high-decibel 
level that took away most of the pleasure they were intended to impart.

Ventura. $19.50. (805) 648-1888.

HE WANTS US TO GET THE CONNECTION; FOLK MUSIC: TO BLUE SPRUCE STANDING DEER, 
LINKS ARE IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY BETWEEN HIS SONGS AND HIS PAINTINGS. HE WILL 
PERFORM THIS EVENING IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO.

 The art of Blue Spruce Standing Deer is about connections: between the 
physical and spiritual worlds and, in a narrower sense, between his music and 
his painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm singing, I bring in a painting, and when I paint, I'm singing a 
song," Standing Deer said in a telephone interview from his studio in Taos, 
N.M. "The paintings go with the songs and the songs go with the paintings." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing Deer will perform today at the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library, 
singing his own compositions while accompanying himself on drum. Several of his 
paintings will also be on display. The event will be his first solo concert, 
although he has performed often at cultural events in Taos and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program itself is very simplified," Standing Deer said. "I want to move 
people with my voice." A member of the Tiwa people, Standing Deer is a resident 
of Taos Pueblo, heir to a family tradition of medicine men (his name, in Tiwa, 
is Pha-Quen-Nee-e). He sings in Tiwa and tonight will offer explanations of his 
songs in English. 
</P>
<P>
 His highly stylized paintings express his interpretation of Tiwa beliefs and 
oral tradition. When painting, he said, he "communicates" with the second 
(spirit) world and translates his visions to canvas. His songs comment directly 
on the themes and content of the paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's concert is part of an effort by Standing Deer, 48, to reach a wider 
audience with his music (his paintings, he said, have been exhibited in private 
galleries nationwide). It is a chance for people, he said, "to really see what 
the American Indian is like, rather than just see movie versions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has one album on tape, which came about as the result of a chance meeting 
in Laguna Beach three years ago, when he was singing on Main Beach as part of a 
"full-moon presentation." There, he met Los Angeles producer Terrie Marie, who 
went on to record his "One Voice" album. That connection also eventually led to 
tonight's San Juan Capistrano concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make it fun, and I make it interesting to hear. My voice is really 
different," Standing Deer said. In concert, he added, "I try to focus on the 
main energy. . . . The more people I have (in the audience), the more strength 
I pick up from the energy, and the better the performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the themes central to Native American beliefs are now being 
incorporated into the environmental movement and in other aspects of mainstream 
life, Standing Deer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are barely catching up to what we've been saying for hundreds 
of years," the singer and painter said. Through his songs, he said, he hopes to 
add to that momentum. "Everything is so unbalanced nowadays. It's important 
that we all share what we have. . . . Music just opens doors." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a great deal of criticism from Native Americans recently 
directed at some elements of the New Age movement, which incorporate and 
commercialize some traditional practices. Standing Deer agrees with many of the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many wanna-bes out there it's ridiculous," he said. He and his 
family are willing to share many aspects of Tiwa culture, but some customs and 
ceremonies are not to be shared with outsiders and are certainly not meant to 
be exploited commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is something the Tiwa can share with outside cultures, he said, it is 
a sense of unity and balance between our physical and spiritual sides, and a 
respect for the Earth. It is not possible for someone to "become" a Native 
American, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be born into it," he said. "I couldn't be Italian if I tried." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Tiwa and other Native Americans, maintaining that spiritual balance 
and the sense of culture can be difficult in the face of pressures from 
mainstream culture. That has been brought home anew to Standing Deer as he 
watches his teen-age sons, Corey and Jarack, struggle with the lure of fast 
cars and brand-name clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult balance," he said. "The (modern) world is always trying to 
change us. But we didn't come to (that) world. It came to us." 
</P>
<P>
 * Blue Spruce Standing Deer will perform today at 7 and 9 p.m. in the La Sala 
Auditorium of San Juan Capistrano Regional Library, 31495 El Camino Real, San 
Juan Capistrano. $3. (714) 493-1752.

FAMILY TIES; THE CASSIDYS, WHO WERE RAISED ON IRISH MUSIC, ADD THEIR OWN 
FLOURISH TO TRADITIONAL SOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 For the Cassidys, music has been a family business from the very beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my brothers has said that our earliest experience was hearing an 
O'Carolan concerto in the (crib)," Feargus Cassidy said by phone from 
Philadelphia. Feargus is one of six Cassidy brothers -- along with Odhran, 
Seathrun, Aongus, Ciaran and Siontan -- who are performing together on a 
national tour that includes a stop today at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cassidys play traditional Irish music, as might be suggested by that 
lineup of names and by the reference to O'Carolan, a 17th-Century Irish 
harpist-composer. The group's repertory ranges from old favorites to obscure 
airs and ballads rescued from the country's rich musical past, along with a 
growing selection of their own compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 They grew up in Ireland's rugged western coastal territory of County Donegal, 
where their father and mother steeped them in Gaelic culture and music. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the tradition comes down to us through our parents," said Feargus 
Cassidy. "Music was always part of our family life." 
</P>
<P>
 Their father, Sean Cassidy, conducted the Gaelic choir -- which all 10 
children took part in -- at their church on Sundays, and afterward they would 
gather to practice their music. Sean, a fiddler, has remained involved with his 
children's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a great knowledge of Irish music," said Cassidy. "He's our harshest 
critic. Whenever we play, he is the person who is most difficult to please." 
</P>
<P>
 He also helps in researching some of the forgotten gems of Irish music that 
the brothers play alongside the favorites. That came in especially handy when 
the group recorded "1691," a historical theme album that came out in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The album collected songs relating to Patrick Sarsfield, who played a leading 
role in the Irish Roman Catholic resistance to England's King William III. The 
Jacobites, as they were called, were forced to surrender after their defeat in 
a battle at Aughrim in the year of the album's title. 
</P>
<P>
 That defeat preceded a rapid decline in Gaelic language, music and culture. 
"The way of life changed completely after 1690," Cassidy said. "In a way we 
wanted to recapture the old Gaelic order before the change." 
</P>
<P>
 In a nod to that order, the group sings many songs in Gaelic, which the family 
spoke as its everyday language. Its ties to tradition do not prevent the group 
from putting a distinct stamp on its arrangements, however, with elements of 
modern folk and other musical textures. 
</P>
<P>
 The six members of the group now active (the lineup fluctuates) all sing and 
all play a variety of instruments, including such Irish staples as uilleann 
(elbow) pipes (an Irish variant on the bagpipe), fiddle, bodhran (an Irish 
drum), accordion and bouzouki, as well as occasional modern touches, including 
synthesizer and bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find that different kinds of songs require different kinds of 
arrangements," Cassidy explained.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite playing together informally for years, and undertaking classical-music 
training, the family did not perform professionally until one summer on the 
island of Valentia in County Kerry, when, as Cassidy put it, "we got sort of 
hungry and thirsty." 
</P>
<P>
 A one-night stand at a local hotel turned into a summer-long engagement, and 
the Cassidys have been performing all over Ireland since, with regular 
appearances at the National Concert Hall in Dublin, the city where the group 
now makes its home. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the group has been making tours to the United States, first 
conquering the Irish strongholds of the East Coast and moving slowly westward 
on each successive tour. Today's concert in Costa Mesa is its first in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also continues to record. Its most recent disc, "The Cassidys," 
collects selections from earlier albums and matches them with new recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy attributes the enduring popularity of Irish music to its "phenomenal 
melodies" and to its emotional range. "I think there's a joy, but there's also 
a great deal of sorrow there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music in Ireland is part of the people. It's not just a group deciding to be 
a group -- everyone in Ireland feels a part of the music. And it's fun, you 
know. You can have this in a pub or in a concert hall." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Cassidys perform Irish music today at 2:30 p.m. in the Robert B. Moore 
Theatre, Orange Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. $10 to $13. 
(714) 432-5880.

ABC CENSORS DOCTOR'S COMMENTS ON 'HOME' SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pediatrician who is a consultant to ABC's "Home" show expressed dismay this 
week after learning that some of his comments about the influence of alcohol 
ads on television were cut from the West Coast broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jay Gordon, who practices in Santa Monica and Malibu, called it "a 
chicken-doo thing to do," suggesting that the network was "influenced by the 
fact that these are large advertisers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Children think that it is cool to drink . . . " Gordon said on the March 9 
installment of "Home." "When you have cartoon characters and animated beer 
bottles, you are advertising to children. I don't want to seem like I'm an 
un-fun guy because I oppose the advertising of cancer-causing and 
disease-causing and death-causing drugs to children , but I don't think that 
this should be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The words in italics were heard live on the East Coast and in the Midwest, but 
were deleted when the show was broadcast on tape later on the West Coast. 
Viewers here saw his lips move but heard nothing.  
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, who didn't learn of the deleted words until a reporter asked him about 
the incident Thursday, at first responded facetiously: "Gosh, I wonder what 
they objected to. They don't realize that these drugs cause disease and death, 
for heaven's sake? I certainly hope it wasn't the fact that beer manufacturers 
spend tens of millions of dollars on ABC that influenced the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for ABC said: "This ("Home") show cannot be used as a platform for 
family members (meaning employees) to air their personal views. We felt his 
comments were inappropriate and therefore removed them." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the decision to cut them was made by Susan Futterman, ABC's director 
of standards and practices. The network declined to make her available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon's remarks on "Home" came during a panel discussion with Lawrence 
Wallack, a professor of public health at UC Berkeley, and Hal Shoup, executive 
vice president of the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies. Wallack is 
co-author of a study showing that ads that portray "alcohol being part of the 
good life" influence youngsters' later use; Shoup maintained that it is a First 
Amendment right to advertise a legal product and that ads have "no relationship 
whatsoever" on children's future drinking habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home" executive producer Woody Fraser said Friday that he had objected to the 
order to cut Gordon's words from the tape but was overruled. He said he 
occasionally crosses swords with Futterman's department over material on the 
program; indeed, Gordon had been bleeped a few weeks earlier in a discussion of 
cigarette advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, Susan Futterman never says to you directly it has anything to do 
with potential sponsor problems," Fraser said, "but the 'Home' show is 
considered to be an advertiser-friendly show. So we sell a lot of spots. We 
make a lot of money for the network." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the March 9 program, "Home" host Gary Collins told viewers: "ABC 
has asked that we read the following statement, and that is, 'The network has 
clear guidelines and restrictions about when beer and wine commercials can be 
aired so as not to encourage the use of such products in our young audiences. 
They also will not run commercials that portray or encourage the use of those 
products by young people who have not reached, or appear not to have reached, 
legal drinking age."

THEATER REVIEW; 'STALAG 17' CAN'T ESCAPE DATEDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Stalag 17" is exactly the kind of play that only "the good war" -- as Studs 
Terkel termed World War II -- could produce. 
</P>
<P>
 When we think of American POWs today, we think of Vietnamese bamboo cages and 
The Wall. The Nazi barracks in Donald Bevan's and Edmund Trzcinski's 
drama-comedy, now in a revival at the Huntington Beach Playhouse, don't seem 
that terrible in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, for the captured American airmen back then, they were. (To drive 
the point home, Bevan and Trzcinski even insert Nazi violations of Geneva 
Convention regulations.) Nevertheless, after Vietnam, the Pueblo and the recent 
POWs in Ethiopia, the bad guys in this play seem only moderately bad. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for "Stalag 17" to work, we have to will ourselves back to the good war. 
That won't be hard for some (Sunday's audience was full of seniors who could 
remember). 
</P>
<P>
 And for those not so senior, it's doubly hard, since "Hogan's Heroes," the TV 
spinoff of Billy Wilder's movie spinoff of the play, is always in the 
background. A funny show, but a weird one to look at while Vietnam was being 
broadcast during dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, however, isn't nearly as deliberately funny as that series or the 
movie, which shows you what effect a successful spinoff can have. (Wilder's 
version especially goosed up the laughs and lowered the drama's volume.) 
</P>
<P>
 It wastes no time setting up the contestants: on one hand, bitter, alienated 
Sefton (Weldon Michaels), who's suspected of being a spy; on the other, 
barracks commanding officer Hoffman (Michael Durack), security man Price (John 
Arthur) and buddies Stosh and Shapiro (Anthony Ramirez and Mark Cook), who do 
the suspecting. Actually, all the guys are suspicious -- Sefton has two sets of 
enemies and finds himself in two sets of prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 This is surely the best idea in "Stalag 17," but it's played out with the 
standard '50s dramatic bathos that makes the play a dated chestnut. Sefton is 
too bitter, too unlikable, too contentious for there not to be something else 
going on. 
</P>
<P>
 The misdirection -- as the term in the trade goes -- is ladled on too thick 
for our own suspicions not to take rise. What kind of monster would tell Cpl. 
Shultz (Lee Laningham) about every planned escape, for instance? Sefton is an 
early James Dean type, a brother to Prewitt, the alienated hero of "From Here 
to Eternity." But he's not evil. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels admirably pushes this guy's bitterness to the limit, unafraid to play 
up Sefton's ugliness. Durack generally plays it cool as the man in charge. But, 
triggered by the mano-a-mano confrontations, melodramatics are never far away, 
and this infects most of director Cyndi Mitchell's cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez and Cook remarkably resemble Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck (who 
were the sidekicks in both the Broadway and film versions), but they also do a 
lot of tired snarling. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur's security man is the weakest link, always seeming as if he's not quite 
sure where to go next. Brian McCoy, as a Boston rich boy suspected by the Nazis 
of being a saboteur, is good at the boyishness but doesn't project the kind of 
privileged attitude that sends Sefton up a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Toth's actor-soldier isn't able to pull off the impersonations he's 
asked to perform (there are too many as written in any case, another example of 
the play's ham-fistedness). But Laningham grows in his role as Shultz, and 
James Cavens as camp commandant really does command attention in an 
all-German-speaking part, absolutely oozing with Third Reichian control and 
chilliness. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin G. Eckmann's set is a good fit on the playhouse's newish stage, but 
Jeff Warner's lights could do with less warmth and more claustrophobic 
coldness. That effect comes through much better with a sound design (by 
Mitchell and Brent Turner) of crossed radio signals.

KERRIGAN'S BAD RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Greg Braxton's "Skategate: And Now the Movies" (March 3), he refers to 
Nancy Kerrigan's derogatory comments while making a Disney World appearance as 
aired on NBC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw the NBC report that outlined Kerrigan's attitude toward the press and, 
seemingly , the Disney appearance where the microphones caught her sorry cracks 
to Mickey Mouse, who rode in the parade car with her. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read in The Times' Sports section that Kerrigan denied she meant 
criticism of Disney World and was referring to her mother's "order" that she 
wear her silver medal, I thought Kerrigan was covering up to retain her 
lucrative Disney contract. However, on ABC News, I saw tape of Kerrigan riding 
with Mickey that showed a totally different version of her comments that proved 
her case: Her unhappiness was over wearing the Olympic medal, which she 
considered "bragging." 
</P>
<P>
 The person at NBC who inserted the derogatory bias against Kerrigan deserves 
to be fired.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; PHAIR'S READY FOR LEADERSHIP ROLE IN ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Liz Phair, Take 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the timidity of the Chicago-based songwriter's show in December at the 
Troubadour, it's good for her that the Village Voice's annual poll to name the 
year's top pop act is based on recordings rather than concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Phair's debut album, "Exile in Guyville," was named the best record of 1993 in 
the survey of 300 pop critics, but the inexperienced performer had so little 
presence on stage at the Troubadour that she neutralized her frequently 
liberating, feminist-minded looks at sexual stereotypes and roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so before a packed house Thursday night at the Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a likable set by the Spinanes that was victimized by muddy sound, a 
more confident and assured Liz Phair (pronounced: fair) became Liz Phlair (you 
got it). 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a teasing mini-skirt that telegraphed her refusal to deny her own 
sexuality, Phair sang and played guitar with the conviction and authority of 
someone who not only has learned to enjoy the spotlight, but is also ready to 
assume the leadership role in rock that the album suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she is not a show-stopping singer, Phair brings an intelligence and 
commentary to her phrasing that accents the provocative edges in songs that 
challenge the male attitudes and assumptions that dominate rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a three-piece band that plays a highly melodic pop-rock seasoned 
with an occasional hint of the Stones, Phair alternated deftly between 
put-downs ("I bet you fall in bed too easily") to longings ("Whatever happened 
to a boyfriend / The kind of guy who makes love / Because he's in it"). 
</P>
<P>
 As with most new artists, the material is uneven, but the best of it is 
memorable indeed -- and she now showcases it with a manner that is equally 
seductive and smart.

ANN MARTIN MAY BE HEADED TO KCBS; TELEVISION: CHANNEL 2 DEAL WOULD REPORTEDLY 
PAY HER MORE THAN $1.5 MILLION A YEAR. KABC WITHDRAWS CONTRACT OFFER TO THE 
STATION'S LONGTIME ANCHOR.

 Local TV-news insiders predicted Friday that longtime anchor Ann Martin will 
land at KCBS-TV Channel 2 now that KABC-TV Channel 7, her professional home for 
the past 18 years, has retracted its lucrative offer to retain her services. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS, which has been struggling for the past two decades to make headway in 
the news ratings, reportedly has offered Martin a multiyear deal that would pay 
her more than $1.5 million a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Applegate, KCBS' general manager, was not available for comment Friday, 
but he has said in past interviews that when major local news players become 
available, he would be interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local news observers, who asked not to be identified, speculated that 
top-rated KABC's announcement Thursday might cut into Martin's price tag since 
there was one less station bidding for her. 
</P>
<P>
 KABC General Manager Alan Nesbitt said in an interview Friday that Channel 7 
had been offering Martin a huge raise since last September. He would not 
disclose the exact terms of the deal, but he did not dispute published reports 
that put it at $1.3 million annually for five years. Martin currently makes 
about $750,000 to anchor the 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems strange that we couldn't keep her, because I think she really wants 
to stay, but we had a very generous offer on the table and never got any 
response from her representative," Nesbitt said. "And we decided we were not 
going to be taken to the last minute and then into some kind of public auction. 
I'm terribly disappointed and somewhat mystified." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Hookstraten, Martin's agent, did not return phone calls Friday. Martin, who 
will continue on the air at KABC until her contract expires next month, was on 
vacation and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesbitt said the KABC offer is now completely off the table, but he did not 
rule out the possibility that the station would re-sign Martin if the situation 
changed during the next month.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources speculated that if Martin does land at KCBS, the station will probably 
release anchor Bree Walker when her option comes up later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesbitt predicted that KABC would maintain its lead in the local news ratings 
without Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some short-term hits in ratings, but viewers make their choices 
based on more than just one person," he said. "We still have a lot of anchor 
stars and rising stars, and I'm confident that KABC will do just fine and will 
continue to satisfy our viewers." 
</P>
<P>
 Other local observers said that losing "The Oprah Winfrey Show," which 
provides KABC with a huge lead-in advantage to its daily news block, would be a 
far more significant loss than Martin.

KCBS TO ESTABLISH MINORITY EMPLOYEE PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KCBS-TV Channel 2, in the wake of the announcement of a federal investigation 
into alleged racism and sexism in the newsrooms of all major commercial local 
television stations, is establishing a minority employee advisory panel within 
the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
 News Director Bob Jordan said in a staff memo that the six-member panel would 
"insure clear communication" and "provide a means of soliciting feedback from 
minority employees." 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS came under fire this week from Los Angeles City Councilman Richard 
Alatorre, the Los Angeles Urban League, the National Hispanic Media Coalition 
and the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation/L.A., which said they have 
heard numerous complaints from newsroom staffers about the treatment of 
minorities, women and gays.  
</P>
<P>
 The complaints, along with reports of alleged racial bias against Latinos at 
KNBC-TV Channel 4, has prompted an investigation into the news operations of 
all local stations by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's memo to the staff Thursday, a copy of which was obtained by The 
Times, said that KCBS management is committed to crafting "a broadcast that 
reflects the cultural diversity of the market we serve" and to establishing "a 
workplace culture in which performance -- and nothing else -- determines 
hiring, promotion and workplace assignments." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate word from KCBS on who would be serving on the minority 
employee advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS management also announced to the staff on Thursday that they had hired 
Maria Helen Campa, a member of the California Chicano News Media Assn., as an 
assignment editor. Campa, who will start next month, was formerly at KCAL-TV 
Channel 9.

 PARK & RIDE? If you can't decide between taking your bicycle or taking the 
bus, you can do both in Orange County now. The county bus system has new 
bicycle racks on the back of buses along five of its lines in Fullerton, Orange 
and Irvine. . . . Loading is easy, takes under 30 seconds, officials say, and 
the bus driver doesn't mind waiting. More routes are expected to be added. In 
fact, the County Transportation Authority is asking you to call (714) 560-OCTA 
(560-6282) to tell them where you want them. 
</P>
<P>
 TOUGH MAINTAINING: You might not think there would be a great demand for 
maintenance jobs -- starting pay under $24,000. But the city of Buena Park has 
found itself trying to choose two people for maintenance work out of 625 
applicants. In past years, officials say, they haven't had one-fourth that 
many. . . . Says the city's director of administrative services: "A lot of 
people out there are still unemployed. Any job we're recruiting for, the 
applicant pool is going to be large." 
</P>
<P>
 MORE BEAUTY: It's been a busy time for Cal State Fullerton alumna Linda 
Woolverton, the screenwriter two years ago for the Disney movie "Beauty and the 
Beast." She's got a new children's movie in the works for Miramax, and she's 
been living on both coasts, preparing the book for next month's Broadway stage 
opening of "Beauty and the Beast." But tonight, Woolverton returns to her alma 
mater: She's one of four being honored by the university as distinguished 
alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 AFTER STARDOM: A song in the long-running musical "A Chorus Line" says: "If 
Troy Donahue could be a movie star, then I could be a movie star." Maybe his 
acting seemed a little wooden to critics, but Donahue was still the blond 
heartthrob of TV and movies three decades back. And he still gets calls when 
they're looking for beach heroes. . . . Example: He's guest master of 
ceremonies at a National Charity League gala at the Huntington Beach's 
Waterfront Hilton resort tonight. Theme: "Surf City, Here We Come."

RAMS TRADE LONGTIME QB EVERETT TO SAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Jim Everett, who brought the Rams to the brink of the Super Bowl 
in 1990 but was driven to the bench by boos and poor play last season, saw his 
career with the team end Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, hoping to free money under the National Football League's new salary 
cap, traded Everett to Western Conference rival New Orleans for a seventh-round 
choice in the 1995 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that the change will do Jim Everett great," said Everett, 
who was replaced as the starter in the middle of last season by backup T.J. 
Rubley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through the ups and downs in the NFL, and I know what it takes to 
win. I've been one game away from the Super Bowl, and I've been in the toilet 
bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints, the only team to show interest in the struggling quarterback, 
renegotiated a two-year contract in which Everett will take a pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, Everett will receive $1 million in base salary, a $500,000 signing 
bonus prorated over the two years and a $250,000 reporting bonus. The contract 
also includes $500,000 in incentive bonuses. The second year would have a base 
of $2 million with an additional $500,000 if the team exercises an option on 
the contract and another $500,000 in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett was to have earned $2 million in base salary and $650,000 in bonus 
money in 1994 with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints also gave Everett a vote of confidence as their starter by cutting 
starter Wade Wilson, who led the team to a 5-0 start last season but struggled 
to an 8-8 finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade marks the end of Everett's sometimes rewarding but often frustrating 
career in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 He was billed as the team's quarterback of the future in 1986, when the Rams 
gave up two players and three draft picks for him in a trade with Houston. He 
became the Rams' all-time leading passer, surpassing records set by Roman 
Gabriel, but he was 46-60 as the team's starter, with the team winning just 17 
games while losing 40 in the past four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Rams signed free agent Chris Miller to a three-year, $9-million 
contract March 7, they had one high-priced quarterback too many. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim Everett is an excellent quarterback," Rams Coach Chuck Knox said in 
prepared statement. "We wish him well." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett said the low point of his career came last season, when the Rams were 
3-6 with him starting. Knox replaced Everett with Rubley for seven of the final 
nine games. The team considered cutting Everett in November to save money, but 
instead cut Mike Pagel, another backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some ups and downs in my career," Everett said. "When I was benched 
for T.J., and the reasons might not be as obvious as they seem, it was the most 
discouraging point of my career. It wasn't that I was hurt (physically), the 
coach wanted to go in a new direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have been shopping Everett, 6 feet 5 and 212 pounds, since the 
trading period opened Feb. 17, but they found little interest until the Saints 
began discussions earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were seeking a second- or third-round draft pick for Everett, who 
finished last season ranked 29th out of 30 NFL quarterbacks in passing 
efficiency. But at a staff meeting Thursday, they decided to no longer demand a 
high draft pick and to unload Everett and his salary. 
</P>
<P>
 They were eager to do so because team officials have been uncharacteristically 
aggressive in the free-agent market, signing Miller, defensive tackle Jimmie 
Jones and extending an offer sheet to Houston offensive lineman Kevin 
Donnalley. 
</P>
<P>
 The signings mean the Rams will face problems with the league's new 
$33.8-million salary cap, because they are also trying to re-sign some of their 
17 free agents and are pursuing a free-agent wide receiver. A team official 
said the Rams still will be held accountable for part of what they would have 
paid Everett under the cap; they are negotiating with the NFL to determine how 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett had two years left on his contract. In 1993, he was designated as the 
team's transition player for the 1996 season, after his contract was to expire. 
That meant the Rams would maintain the right of first refusal and be able to 
match any offer Everett received from another team. 
</P>
<P>
 With the trade, the Rams will now be able to use the transition designation 
for another young star. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett flew to New Orleans on Thursday night and was introduced to the local 
media Friday by Saints Coach Jim Mora, who described him as "one of the best 
quarterbacks in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett had one of his best games as a pro against the Saints in 1989, 
completing 29 of 51 passes for 454 yards in a 20-17 overtime victory at New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely pleased and happy to have him as a part of team," Mora said. 
"We have seen some exhibitions where he has blistered us, and now we hope he 
can blister some other teams for the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the size, escapability in the pocket and a great arm. He can throw all 
the patterns. He has the toughness and experience, all the things you are 
looking for in a quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 But Everett's toughness has been questioned during his tenure with the Rams: 
</P>
<P>
 * There was the infamous "phantom sack," which occurred during a 30-3 loss to 
the San Francisco 49ers in the 1990 NFC Championship game. Everett was widely 
criticized after he dropped back to pass and fell to the ground without being 
touched. 
</P>
<P>
 * And last season, reports from New York quoted Rams players referring to 
Everett as "Chris Evert" -- a reference to the women's tennis player -- for his 
lack of the courage to take hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the low point of my career," he said. "I don't think I was able to 
play to the best of my ability. I didn't have the confidence in myself, and I 
didn't feel the people around me had the confidence in me to play." 
</P>
<P>
 To acquire Everett, the Rams traded defensive end William Fuller, guard Kent 
Hill, first-round draft choices in 1987 and '88, and a fifth-round 1987 choice 
to the Houston Oilers. Houston had made Everett the third overall selection in 
the 1986 draft behind running back Bo Jackson (Tampa Bay) and nose tackle Tony 
Casillas (Atlanta). 
</P>
<P>
 Everett made his rookie debut by coming off the bench to complete 12 of 19 
passes for 193 yards and three touchdowns in a 30-28 loss to New England. He 
became the team's full-time starter in his first season, and passed for 1,018 
yards with eight touchdowns and eight interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 His productivity grew the next three seasons as he developed into one of the 
league's top quarterbacks. He completed 59.6% of his passes in 1988 for 3,964 
yards with 31 touchdowns and 18 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, he became the first Ram to throw for more than 4,000 yards in a 
season (4,310), and led the Rams to a 13-6 record and the conference 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The following season, he threw for 3,989 yards and became the Rams' first Pro 
Bowl quarterback since Pat Haden in 1977. But the team finished 5-11, the first 
of four consecutive seasons with fewer than seven victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox replaced John Robinson as the Rams' coach after a 3-13 season in 1991, 
bringing his rushing-oriented "Ground Chuck" offense with him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Everett played well in his first season under Knox, completing 281 of 475 
passes (59.2%) for 3,323 yards with 22 touchdowns and 18 interceptions. The 
Rams finished 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the losing seasons, Everett started 87 consecutive games, a streak 
that ended Oct. 31 at San Francisco. He had been benched the previous week 
after completing only one of nine pass attempts for 12 yards with one 
interception in a 16-13 loss to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 After Rubley failed to impress in a 40-17 loss to the 49ers, Everett started 
against Atlanta and Washington before again being replaced by Rubley in the 
second half against the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 He played in his final game as a Ram on Dec. 5 at Phoenix, replacing Rubley in 
the second half and completing six of 13 passes for 68 yards and a touchdown in 
a 38-10 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Los Angeles, I felt I had six of my best years I've ever had," Everett 
said. "There were 10 games in the 1993 season where I didn't play to best of my 
ability. I wasn't happy last year, and the Rams weren't happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett said he thinks he can regain his confidence in New Orleans, which 
finished 21st in the league in passing offense (183.8 yards a game) last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints recently signed free agent Michael Haynes of Atlanta, one of the 
league's best receivers, and they feature a promising young running back in 
Derek Brown, a former Anaheim Servite High standout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim is at the prime of his career, and he has been healthy for eight years," 
Mora said. "He had great success and won playoff games. The only thing he 
hasn't done is been to a Super Bowl, and we hope he can help us accomplish 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what he thought of the Rams trading him to a team in the same 
division, Everett said: "I don't know about the decisions the Rams make. I will 
never bad-mouth the team that I enjoyed playing for for eight years." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he want out of Anaheim after this season? 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," he said. "I wish I would have said it publicly sooner." 
</P>
<P>

RAMS, ANAHEIM STILL DISCUSSING PRACTICE SITE; TALKS: OFFICIALS NEGOTIATING THE 
CONVERSION OF THE FACILITY BACK TO A SCHOOL IF THE TEAM DECIDES TO LEAVE. 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Rams' latest deadline to sign a new lease with the city for 
their practice facility passed Friday with the football team still in place and 
negotiators planning meetings to resolve the one issue causing the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Rams, the city and the Magnolia School District will meet 
by Tuesday to determine how much it would cost to convert the team's practice 
facility back into an elementary school, if the team moves after next season as 
threatened, officials said. Under a complicated agreement, the city leases the 
school from the district and then sublets it to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its previous lease with the city, which expired Dec. 31, the Rams would 
have been liable for the conversion. But the team has balked at signing a new 
agreement with that clause and have tried to force the city to agree to pick up 
at least part of the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 15 years the Rams have practiced at the former Juliette Low Elementary 
School, they have converted classrooms into weight rooms and offices, installed 
locker rooms and showers and replaced asphalt playgrounds with grass practice 
fields. The conversion cost could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams are concerned that there is no cap on their liability," City Atty. 
Jack L. White said Friday. "The city and district have been unwilling to put a 
cap in place. We decided we need to find out how much money we are talking 
about. Are we talking about a large amount of money? A small amount? It's hard 
for anybody to make a decision if we don't know how many dollars we are talking 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 White said the estimate will be presented to the City Council on Tuesday 
night, and council members could decide then how much, if any, financial help 
to promise the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials refused to comment on the lease Friday. Magnolia officials 
released a statement saying they support the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who are being courted by several cities, including Baltimore and St. 
Louis, have told Anaheim they will file a notice by May saying they might move 
out of Anaheim Stadium after this season. If the team moves, it will be 
responsible for paying off a $30-million mortgage on the stadium that paid for 
a 1979 expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine why the Rams are making such a big deal out of this 
(paying for the school reconversion) when they are going to have to pay off the 
stadium," White said. "But (Ram's Executive Vice President) John Shaw is a good 
negotiator and I respect that. He's trying to get a good deal for his side."

MEDICAL BOARD HEAD CALLS FOR END TO DOCTORS' FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of ongoing efforts to make the California Medical Board more consumer 
oriented, the board's executive director said Friday that he would prefer to 
have its work funded by state taxpayers instead of physician licensing fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like that surgeons and physicians pay fees to support us," said Dixon 
Arnett, who was one of several participants in a panel discussion at the 
California Medical Assn.'s annual Western Scientific Assembly here. The panel 
discussed whether the Medical Board of California is doing its job of 
disciplining physicians. Arnett said it is important for the board, which both 
licenses and disciplines the state's 70,000 practicing physicians, to distance 
itself from the CMA to avoid any seeming conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The medical board by law is a consumer protection organization and not an 
auxiliary of the CMA," Arnett said.  
</P>
<P>
 Arnett said, however, that the board's decisions are not influenced by its 
source of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his comments Friday during the weeklong gathering at the Disneyland 
Hotel that will culminate Wednesday with a satellite conference between 
President Clinton and CMA delegates on the topic of health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett took over leadership in January, 1993, about the same time the 
California Highway Patrol released a report harshly criticizing the board for 
misconduct and mismanagement, including the wholesale dismissal of complaints 
against physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Arnett said, the board has enacted "the most extensive set of 
reforms in the history of any regulatory agency in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert C. Fellmeth, a lawyer representing the Center for Public Interest 
Law, said Friday he believes the board's enforcement record is still 
"pathetic," noting "no more than five or 10 (physician) licenses are removed 
each year because of incompetence." He said that complaints are "clogging the 
system" because "there are not enough district attorneys working the cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of eliminating physician financial support of the board, Fellmeth 
recommended increasing physician licensing fees from $600 every two years to 
$800 a year to beef up enforcement. He also proposed that the board take 
responsibility to provide continuing education and retesting of physicians as 
part of its licensing function. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul J. Pfingst, representing attorneys who defend physicians in medical board 
cases, decried the emphasis on punishment. "We need a system that looks at 
salvaging the physician," he said. "Good doctors can make a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, Pfingst said, doctors who have been disciplined by the board for 
relatively minor offenses have had their careers destroyed. He said any 
disciplinary action becomes magnified because information about it is shared by 
numerous regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett, however, said the medical board this year will go to the state 
Legislature for authorization to share information with consumers about doctors 
who have been disciplined by the staffs of hospitals where they have practiced. 
Currently, state law requires such information to be kept confidential until 
the board completes its own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett said it is a good sign that the board is being sued by the CMA for 
allegedly disclosing too much information, while at the same time it is under 
attack from California news organizations for not disclosing enough. He said 
the board is "wending a careful path through the middle of extremes."

BERGESON SEX-CRIME BILL GAINS MOMENTUM; LEGISLATURE: NEWPORT BEACH SENATOR'S 
'ONE-STRIKE' MEASURE WOULD JAIL RAPISTS, CHILD MOLESTERS FOR LIFE. IT'S RIDING 
THE GET-TOUGH WAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the planned parole of two notorious serial rapists creating public 
outrage, an Orange County lawmaker has landed in the midst of the state's 
latest anti-crime crusade -- ensuring that sex offenders are jailed for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) is pushing a "one strike and you're 
out" bill that would require first-time convicted rapists and child molesters 
to spend life in prison without the possibility of parole. Although reviled by 
civil libertarians, the proposal seems to have election-year support. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's bill has gained steam with the outcry in recent days over the 
parole of repeat rapist Melvin A. Carter, who was released in a remote Northern 
California town after serving less than half his 25-year sentence. Residents of 
Claremont, meanwhile, protested this week after learning that Christopher Evans 
Hubbart -- believed to be responsible for 50 rapes -- was to be paroled there. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cases prompted Gov. Pete Wilson to complain that he is "outraged and 
sickened" that 250 rapists are released from prison each month under current 
state laws. He also began drumming up support for Bergeson's "one-strike" bill, 
which is part of the governor's legislative package. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge anyone concerned about brutal rapists . . . to support our 
'one-strike' legislation," Wilson said. "Changing the law is the only way to 
give Californians the protections they need from these types of sexual 
predators." 
</P>
<P>
 While the governor makes his pitch, the measure is attracting harsh criticism 
from the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absurd," said Francisco Lobaco, an ACLU legislative advocate in 
Sacramento. "We'll have to oppose the bill. It just makes the sentences 
disproportionate for the underlying crime. The sentences are already severe." 
</P>
<P>
 Lobaco said that felons convicted of sex crimes routinely serve consecutive 
prison sentences for each conviction, with additional counts adding to their 
time behind bars. Rapists currently can be punished with a sentence of up to 
eight years for a single count, with additional counts adding to the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also suggest that the threat of life sentences for child molesters 
could have a chilling effect among families that might otherwise report a 
problem within their midst. Moreover, some say that life sentences for crimes 
such as date rape would be too severe. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the public in an uproar over crime, most lawmakers have been eager 
this year to prove they can pass tough anti-crime bills, a reality not lost on 
civil libertarians such as Lobaco. 
</P>
<P>
 "All crime bills are political efforts, especially in an election year," he 
said. "This is just one of many. It's unfortunate that it lacks rationality." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson argues that the bill is necessary because most perpetrators of sex 
crimes are repeat offenders who rarely respond to rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to allow them a chance at that second victim," Bergeson said. 
"When you convict someone for rape or brutally molesting a child, that person 
should lose their right to freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the bill could tap into the same sort of public fury and political 
pressure that in recent weeks pushed the "three strikes" anti-crime bill 
through the Legislature at a break-neck pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very much in keeping with the same momentum and the same sort of 
response," Bergeson said. "People are outraged to see those convicted of 
violent sex crimes released back onto the streets. I'm very optimistic it can 
get through the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill could face its toughest test early next month, when it goes before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee headed by Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), a 
strong civil libertarian. Roberti, however, faces a recall attempt on April 12 
mounted by gun rights activists, and Capitol insiders suggest the longtime 
lawmaker would not be in any position to block or dramatically water down 
Bergeson's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the Assembly Public Safety Committee has been the graveyard for 
such legislation. The committee has been reconstituted this year, however, and 
has shown a marked propensity for approving tougher anti-crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bills have not had the problem there that they've had in the past," Bergeson 
said. "I think that committee has become more responsive to the public outcry."

'CLUB HOMELESS' WINS WEEK'S EVICTION STAY; COURTS: JUDGE TEMPORARILY RESTRAINS 
CALTRANS. HEARING IS SET FOR FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A group of homeless people who have lived in an elaborate, furnished 
encampment under the San Diego Freeway, some for as long as five years, 
persuaded a judge on Friday to let them stay at least another week. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours after the legal victory, several acres of a neighboring homeless 
camp burned in a brush fire. Authorities suspect arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the first camp, dubbed "Club Homeless," had been confronted 
Wednesday by state Department of Transportation workers and law enforcement 
authorities and told to find somewhere else to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the residents of the camp at the Beach Boulevard off-ramp filed a 
lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court saying that Caltrans cannot simply kick 
them out of the place they have called home for years, and which included a 
walled bathroom and closets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Judge Helen Thomas issued a temporary restraining order and said 
she would hear arguments from both sides next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They set up their camp and they've been living there. They built their little 
structures and developed the place," said Paul M. Gray, an attorney who met the 
homeless people in a local coffee shop and is representing them in court.  
</P>
<P>
 "Caltrans recognized them as homeless and allowed them to live on their 
property," Gray said. "Once they allowed them to live there, they've got to use 
some different procedure other than putting up a sign saying 'Get out.' They 
have to get them some reasonable accommodations." 
</P>
<P>
 But Albert Miranda, a Caltrans spokesman, said the agency has never given 
homeless people permission to camp under the freeway, and that the area must be 
cleared so workers can conduct maintenance and gardening improvements there. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Miranda said his agency wanted to handle the situation in "the 
most humane way possible," and officials provided the transients with 
information about local shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who slept at Club Homeless were not actually removed from the area 
Wednesday, and many have continued to live there. 
</P>
<P>
 When a fire started Friday afternoon, James Benjamin, who lives in a makeshift 
hut nearby, was returning bottles and cans at a nearby supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone said, 'Hey Jim, look! Your house is on fire,' so I left and ran 
back," Benjamin, 43, recalled an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin, whose hut was spared, said the burned area had been cleared by 
Caltrans several weeks ago. Before that, the area had been called "Kids' Camp" 
because many homeless youth slept there, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt and no property was destroyed in the fire, which began just 
after 5 p.m., burned across several acres of Caltrans property on the east side 
of Beach Boulevard, across the street from Club Homeless, officials said. The 
fire will be investigated as a possible arson, fire dispatcher Steve Rothert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen firefighters from the Huntington Beach, Westminster and Fountain 
Valley departments responded to the blaze, using 3,000 gallons of water to put 
it out, Rothert said. It took them 10 minutes to control the flames and 90 
minutes to extinguish them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Gray nor Miranda knew about the fire Friday afternoon, and both said 
they had no comment on the incident.

GOP LEGISLATORS SQUABBLE OVER RIVAL CANDIDATES; POLITICS: TWO ASSEMBLYMEN WHO 
BACK AN ASSEMBLY HOPEFUL CRITICIZE 2 STATE SENATORS FOR ENDORSING ANOTHER FOR 
THE 70TH DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A rift among conservatives over the 70th Assembly District seat intensified 
Friday when two Orange County assemblymen accused two of the county's state 
senators of meddling in the race in order to "buy" political power. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference announcing their support for attorney Thomas G. 
Reinecke, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who is giving up the 70th 
District seat, and Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) called for an end to 
the "vicious, unsigned, anonymous attacks" being circulated among Republican 
Party activists against Reinecke. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson and Conroy focused their anger at state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden 
Grove) and state Sen. John R. Lewis (R-Orange), who have endorsed Irvine City 
Councilman Barry J. Hammond in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob Hurtt and John Lewis want to control a candidate," Ferguson said. 
"There's no other reason other than their desire to control . . . and obviously 
they are willing to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt said later that he and Lewis had not intended to get involved in the 
race, but did so only after prospective candidates kept approaching them for 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have some people that are for Reinecke and other people that are for 
Barry Hammond, and that's always going to happen," Hurtt said, adding that he 
received a "one-two" punch from Ferguson and Conroy during a breakfast meeting 
earlier in the week. "Why Mr. Ferguson always insists on pointing fingers and 
shaking fingers always amazes me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was unavailable for comment, but his chief of staff, Christopher Jones, 
said the assemblymen "have the right to endorse Tom Reinecke, and Sen. Lewis 
and Sen. Hurtt also have the right to endorse the candidate who they think is 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson and Conroy maintain that if Hurtt, a wealthy businessman, pours funds 
into Hammond's campaign, it will split the conservative vote and make it 
possible for Marilyn C. Brewer, who describes herself as a "mainstream 
Republican," to win the nomination in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson and Conroy maintained that Reinecke should be the party's nominee 
because he has paid his dues as a longtime GOP activist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure they have the money to waste, and that's exactly what it will be -- 
wasted," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt, Lewis and other party power brokers were instrumental in persuading two 
other candidates, Phillip B. Greer and Bruce Peotter, to pull out of the race 
in order to avoid splitting the conservative vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said that he also had hoped to remain neutral, and acknowledged that 
his endorsement of Reinecke poses some risk to his own political career, since 
he is planning to run next year in a special election for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 But the assemblyman also has been increasingly frustrated with what he called 
"outsiders" trying to influence the politics within his Assembly district, 
which generally runs along the coastline from Newport Beach to Laguna Beach and 
inland to Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 During the news conference, Conroy criticized those who have engaged in what 
he said was "character assassination" of Reinecke. He said one "hit piece" 
erroneously stated that Reinecke is a member of the California Trial Lawyers' 
Assn., which is opposed by conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis also recently said in a letter to Republican members of the Legislature 
that Reinecke should not be supported because he is a member of the 
"anti-business" lawyers' organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke's camp, however, contended he never paid dues to the organization and 
was incorrectly listed in its membership roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy also said it was time to put an end to a rumor circulating in 
Republican circles that Reinecke "had paid for an abortion for his girlfriend." 
Reinecke, 34, is single. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling the story was a document found in small claims court, alleging that 
Reinecke did not pay a $175 medical bill. But Conroy released a letter from the 
physician's office that filed the claim, stating that the bill had been paid 
and that the claim was erroneously filed. The doctor's office also stated in 
the letter that the medical treatment related to an injury to Reinecke's knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the medical records, and Tom is the first person I know that has an 
abortion on his knee," Conroy said. "Why would you stoop to the level . . . of 
party politics in a seat that's basically ours for the asking?" 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke, who also attended the news conference, said the accusations are 
"false and untrue." 
</P>
<P>
 "They manufacture something of me going to an orthopedic surgeon for a 
basketball injury into something that's just disgusting," he said. "I was 
offended by it, and I think it should stop. . . ."

ART OUT OF THE ASHES; REMNANTS FROM THE LAGUNA FIRE INSPIRE RESIDENT ROB 
BRENNAN TO CRAFT THEM INTO ARTWORK. THEY MAKE UP HIS FIRST EXHIBIT -- APTLY 
TITLED 'THE PHOENIX PROJECT' -- AT A LOCAL GALLERY. 
</P>

<P>
 A day after the Oct. 27 firestorm ravaged his neighbors' mobile homes, Rob 
Brennan paused amid the twisted ruins at the El Moro Trailer Park and beheld a 
strange beauty all around him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A propane tank had exploded into the shape of a heart; sheets of trailer 
siding were cast into fall colors by the intense heat. The ground was littered 
with scorched, contorted metal and gracefully melted glass -- an eruption of 
"humor, beauty and delicacy," Brennan thought. 
</P>
<P>
 About three days later, with his neighbors' permission, the house painter -- 
who was pictured in Time and Newsweek fighting the blaze from his rooftop -- 
began collecting the mesmerizing debris. And an artist was created. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing what was there, it may sound morbid, but it was beautiful," said 
Brennan, 29. "I started picking (the pieces) up. I had no idea what I was going 
to do with all this, not a clue." 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the ravishing rubble, just a small part of the debris caused by 
the fire that destroyed 366 homes in Laguna Beach, soon became clear to Brennan 
when he fashioned some pieces into a wall sculpture and it sold at an art 
auction for more than $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty heady stuff for me," he said. "I figured, hey, I think I've got 
something here. So I just started working." 
</P>
<P>
 With 28 pieces ranging in size from six inches to six feet now complete -- two 
of them a collaborative effort with a friend -- Brennan will hold his first art 
exhibit today at the Sherwood Gallery in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pledged 15% of the proceeds to the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition, a 
community-based support group for fire victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Mangels, director of the coalition, has previewed the exhibit pieces and 
called them "spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very intense and I think the work shows an amazing sensitivity and 
insight," she said. "I think it's incredibly moving. For those of us who live 
in Laguna, it has a meaning that is almost beyond description." 
</P>
<P>
 While Brennan, whose own dwelling was spared, clearly realizes the fire was a 
horror to hundreds of victims, he said that "for me it was totally a positive 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 By crafting art, "I'm trying to make it positive for other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan, who now labors about 45 hours a week in the confines of his tiny 
studio when not painting houses, seems slightly stunned, not to mention 
overjoyed, at having been cast into the role of an artist. Brimming with 
enthusiasm, he points out piles of battered glass, ceramics and metal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a bunch of junk, to be honest with you," he said. But when he 
focuses on the individual pieces, he is enthralled. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these dents and scratches are from when this just skipped around the 
mobile home park and blew up," Brennan said, pointing to a misshapen propane 
tank leaning against one wall. "To me, this piece is really powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovingly, he holds a melted bottle with a nail protruding from it. The angle 
of the nail seems exactly right to Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is art right here in itself," he said. "I did nothing to create it." 
</P>
<P>
 Against the wall is a long rectangular strip of metal siding, a spotty rust 
and brown. Carefully placed barbecue skewers dangle from its edges. Brennan 
calls it "Skin on a Skewer." He figures the piece will fetch $850. 
</P>
<P>
 "No painter could ever do this," said Brennan, whose father is an artist. "The 
only way you can duplicate this is to take a trailer and start it on fire. To 
me, what this whole thing is about is finding the beauty in disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Local artist Roark Gourley, who helped organize the earlier art auction to aid 
fire victims, said his wife, Michelle, bought Brennan's first sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 "These pieces are so memorable," said Gourley, who placed Brennan's artwork 
above his fireplace. "This is going to be a time you'll never forget in Laguna. 
Every time I look at the piece, I just can't forget that moment. . . . You 
remember the fire, but you also remember the people coming together in the 
community. That's what it really represents." 
</P>
<P>
 Roark Gourley's ex-wife, Donna, who owns Sherwood Gallery, said Brennan was 
destined to be an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been such a natural process for Rob," she said. "It was amazing, 
absolutely amazing -- every piece he's created has some sort of meaning. . . . 
It's really quite touching what he's done." 
</P>
<P>
 Also included in "The Phoenix Project" exhibit, which will run through April 
4, are collaborative pieces by Brennan and friend Lisa Kasprzycki, a former 
Laguna Beach resident who lives in Maui but was here during the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 What will the house painter-turned-artist do when he has used up the last 
shred of evidence of the mighty blaze that scarred his city and, Brennan feels, 
profoundly changed his life? 
</P>
<P>
 He has no idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "This for me was an event in my life that was very powerful. I don't know what 
I'll do after this, but it's been a great start."

MOTHER DISMAYED AS RACE, IQ TEST COLLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was hard enough when Wendy Strong realized her 7-year-old daughter, Brianna 
Combash, might have a learning disability and would need testing to determine 
if special education classes were required. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did she know that a 15-year-old federal court ruling would make her 
ordeal even more complicated, because Brianna's African American heritage makes 
her ineligible for an IQ test that might help identify her learning problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The landmark 1979 federal court ruling prohibits California public schools 
from using standardized intelligence tests on African American children to 
determine mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is ridiculous," Strong said. "They need to have appropriate tests for 
everybody. It shouldn't have anything to do with race." 
</P>
<P>
 In his decision, U.S. District Judge Robert F. Peckham determined that 
commonly used IQ tests were racially and culturally biased, and resulted in a 
disproportionate number of black students being placed in "dead-end" classes 
for the mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was upheld by an appeals court in 1984 and expanded in 1986 to 
prohibit IQ tests for all black students who are candidates for special 
education or other remedial classes, even if their parents request such tests. 
Students of other races are not included in the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought very hard for that ruling," James Colquitt, president of the Orange 
County Chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, 
said of Peckham's initial ruling. An IQ test "is not a valid tool of judgment. 
It has never worked for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Black students under consideration for programs for the academically gifted 
are allowed to take IQ tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong said she can understand how the law may protect some children, but 
doesn't believe it should apply to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brianna, a second-grader at Linda Vista Elementary School in Mission Viejo, 
lives in Laguna Hills. Her father is of African American and Native American 
heritage. Strong is white. Brianna's father could not be reached for comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong believes the situation leaves her only two unacceptable options: have 
Brianna reclassified as white in school records, which would make her instantly 
eligible for an IQ test, or take an alternative assessment that does not 
involve intelligence quotients. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong said she believes the alternative test is inferior and inconclusive, 
and finds the prospect of changing Brianna's ethnicity "morally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to really work with Brianna on loving herself as being a brown 
person," Strong said. "We shouldn't have to change it at all. You should be 
able to state who you are, and have the same rights as everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 A single mother with two young children, Strong said she can't afford an 
estimated $700 for a private IQ test. But meanwhile, Brianna is struggling in 
class, unhappy and losing self-esteem, according to her mother. "I'm not sure 
what we'll do," Strong said. "I'm not going to make any snap decisions. We'll 
just ride with this for the moment and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong is not the first to protest the ruling, which is being challenged in a 
federal appeal stemming from a 1988 San Bernardino County case. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Saddleback Valley Unified School District said they have no 
choice but to follow the law as it currently stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our job to judge if the law is fair or not," said Sharon Fowler, 
director of pupil services. "We have to follow what the state Department of 
Education and the legal branch of the government tells us to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 legal advisory on the issue, the California Department of Education 
recommended that school districts stop utilizing the controversial IQ tests, 
even in testing students for academically gifted programs. The state education 
department has said it wants to phase out use of IQ tests in favor of other 
assessment methods that emphasize helping struggling students do better in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said the alternative assessments are more difficult to use and take 
more time, but yield the same types of information as IQ tests, such as 
abilities involving concentration, memory, reasoning and vocabulary. 
Alternative methods have been used before locally with success, Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no state or federal law requiring the use of IQ tests, although they 
are commonly used throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be characterized as an educational issue instead of a race / 
intelligence quotient issue," said Barry A. Zolotar, deputy general counsel for 
the state Department of Education. "Districts should look for alternative 
assessment procedures which are available" and have proven effective in 
determining special education needs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some districts -- including Los Angeles and San Francisco -- have stopped 
using IQ tests to determine placement in special education classes for all 
students, regardless of race.

ECCLESIASTICAL COURT COULD DETERMINE PIROLI'S FUTURE; RELIGION: THOSE FAMILIAR 
WITH CATHOLIC CANON LAW SAY THAT IF HE CHOSE TO FIGHT TO REMAIN A PRIEST, HE 
MIGHT SUCCEED DESPITE TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Father David Piroli, who outraged superiors by claiming he was framed by his 
senior pastor, may want to stay in the priesthood if his victory in court 
Friday eventually leads to total vindication on charges of stealing $60,000 in 
church collections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's wait and see what happens," he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli, 37, an assistant pastor in Simi Valley until he fled the country amid 
scandal in 1992, was acquitted on one count of grand theft Friday. The jury 
hung 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal on a second theft count, but prosecutors said 
they may refile that charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdicts increased the chance that Piroli may emerge free from the 
criminal justice system, and raised the question of what an ecclesiastical 
court would then do with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys and priests familiar with Catholic canon law said this week that if 
Piroli chose to fight to remain a priest, he might succeed. A key element of 
any church hearing, they said, would be whether Piroli confessed to sins and 
asked for forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business is one of forgiveness, not condemnation," said Ventura attorney 
James Farley, a deacon of the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles and a 
"defender of the bond" in church matrimonial court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer David Patrick Callahan, representing the archdiocese in the Piroli 
case, said church officials might consider defrocking Piroli, an act the church 
refers to as a "removal of priestly faculties" or being "reduced to the lay 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are other things that would be taken into the mix, such as his 
attitude," Callahan said. "The church has as one of its main concepts, the 
consideration of forgiveness and the relationship the priest has with God. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like 'you do the crime, you do the time,' " Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be more complicated if Piroli insisted during a church hearing -- as 
he has during criminal trial -- that he has done nothing wrong and is himself a 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the charges of theft, Piroli would have to answer questions about trace 
amounts of cocaine and $10,000 in cash found in the priest's car when arrested 
with a young Mexican national in Hollywood two years ago. Piroli said he had 
stopped to buy a suitcase for his passenger, who was returning to Mexico to 
recover from cocaine addiction. A suspicious security guard called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have insisted that Piroli skimmed collection money from churches 
in Simi Valley and Saticoy over six years partly to support a cocaine habit. 
Piroli testified that he never used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 At a church hearing, Piroli would also have to explain why his sworn version 
of conversations with two top church officials after his arrest varies so 
greatly with the officials' recollections, Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions remain about why Piroli had nine bank accounts with deposits of 
nearly $55,000 when he was arrested in June, 1992, how he could have saved so 
much on a salary of $350 month, and why churches' cash collections rose sharply 
after he left, the archdiocese lawyer said. Piroli testified that he saved most 
of the banked money from stipends parishioners paid for special services such 
as marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan said he had never heard of a priest accumulating so much money in so 
little time. "We have not yet found another model," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, Piroli would have to convince a hearing board chosen by Cardinal 
Roger Mahony that he was, in fact, framed by his elderly superior, James 
McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli's lawyer, Richard Beada, argued that McKeon skimmed money from the 
coffers of St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley long before Piroli arrived in 
1990. Fearing that Piroli would turn him in, McKeon planted $10,000 in Piroli's 
Chevrolet and most of the $50,000 that was found in the priest's church office 
and bedroom, the lawyer said. Traces of cocaine were also planted in Piroli's 
desk drawer, Beada said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense offered to produce witnesses to testify that McKeon was seen at a 
West Hollywood gay bathhouse, and Beada argued that the older priest was 
stealing money to support this activity. The judge would not allow testimony 
about homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon testified that he never took church money for himself. And the 
archdiocese condemned Piroli's charges as "a gross injustice" made without 
substantiation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very unjust to make allegations like that against Father McKeon, 
who has not been accused of any crime," said Father Gregory Coiro, spokesman 
for the archdiocese comprised of Ventura, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict Friday, the archdiocese issued a statement repeating its 
defense of McKeon: "The archdiocese categorically rejects allegations the 
defense made against the character, good name and reputation of Father James 
McKeon." 
</P>
<P>
 But Piroli's charges against McKeon should not prejudice the archdiocese 
hearing panel, said Msgr. Joseph George, a canon lawyer and pastor of St. 
Paschal Baylon Church in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they would go into it with an openness, but it's really hard for 
people who know Father McKeon to conceive that there is any problem like that," 
George said. "They pretty well are convinced that Father McKeon is not involved 
in anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The confidential church hearing is actually a fact-finding session, where the 
panel decides what it believes to be the truth, George said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little different than a criminal case where all it takes is doubt by 
one juror to hang a jury," he said. "Here you're going to deal with a 
preponderance of evidence. . . .And there may be a possibility of getting at 
the truth more easily." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the hearing, authorities would decide whether psychological 
counseling might help Piroli, George said. "That would be a very distinct 
possibility, without a doubt," he said. "Most of this kind of thing that goes 
on in the church is medicinal, (not) punishment for the sake of punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Mahony would decide what action was appropriate, including 
whether there was just cause to take away Piroli's sanction to act as a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 If the decision were against him, Piroli could appeal to a Congregation of the 
Clergy, a group of bishops in Rome that has the power to overturn an 
archdiocese decision, George said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said it is extremely infrequent that a troubled priest endures the 
hearing process, and even more rare for one to appeal to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person decides that it's not worth it and just takes off, you know," 
George said.

DEPUTY D.A. ENDS HER FIERY CAREER QUIETLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a 16-year career filled with fireworks, Ventura County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Carol Nelson retired from the job Friday in an unusually quiet manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson -- an aggressive prosecutor whom a defendant once called a barracuda -- 
is only the second deputy district attorney ever to retire from the Ventura 
County prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's decision to retire was prompted by a feud with Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury, who disagreed with a report Nelson wrote in a murder case two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury effectively demoted the veteran prosecutor and, after nearly two 
years in the doghouse, Nelson announced her retirement in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other deputy prosecutor to retire from the office was a former FBI 
agent who had become a prosecutor here as a second career, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Nelson, however, being a prosecutor was the only job of her law 
enforcement career. She went to law school at age 30 and worked one year for 
the San Joaquin district attorney's office. She spent the past 15 years with 
the Ventura County district attorney's office, prosecuting a wide variety of 
defendants, from white-collar criminals to murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 She lost only two of roughly 50 major felony jury cases she prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 On her final day of work, Nelson, 50, received warm send-offs from many of 
those with whom she has worked over the years, including defense attorneys who 
opposed her in court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Courtroom adversary Robert Schwartz, a Ventura defense attorney, stopped her 
in the courthouse hallway and wished Nelson the best of luck.  
</P>
<P>
 Kevin J. McGee, Bradbury's chief deputy, called Nelson "a tremendous trial 
talent, very articulate, persuasive and . . . a commanding presence in the 
courtroom. We'll miss her." 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the county's legal community agreed with McGee. Bradbury, who was 
out of the office and unavailable for comment Friday, has declined to publicly 
discuss Nelson's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an outstanding lawyer," Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch said. 
"Certainly one of the best that I have ever seen."  
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James M. Farley said that "the district attorney's office is 
losing one of their most able prosecutors. They are also losing a very caring 
and compassionate woman."  
</P>
<P>
 If any defense attorney knows about Nelson's abilities, Farley does. He often 
found his clients on the receiving end of one of her sarcastic, but 
penetrating, cross-examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No case illustrates that better than Nelson's prosecution of former community 
college district Trustee James. T. (Tom) Ely and his wife, Ingrid. Nelson 
successfully prosecuted the Elys on 32 counts of fraud, conspiracy and 
embezzlement. Tom Ely died recently before being sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carol and I fought tooth and nail on that case," Farley remembered. "We 
really went at it. But through it all I never lost my respect for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Farley also faced Nelson in the 1989 murder case of Linda Axel, who fatally 
stabbed an elderly worker at a restaurant in Ventura. In that case, Nelson 
introduced DNA evidence that linked Axel to the killing, the first such use of 
DNA evidence in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 More than victories such as the one in the Axel case, Nelson said being a 
prosecutor has meant meeting a variety of different people. For instance, her 
first witness in the Axel murder case, molecular biologist Richard J. Roberts, 
won a 1993 Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson has also interviewed a variety of other expert witnesses and learned a 
great deal about science and other phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best part of it. You feel like you are constantly learning 
something new, and you are doing it for something that is socially beneficial," 
she said during an interview earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In her career, she tried about 50 felony cases before juries. She won all but 
two of them. Her last case, an acquaintance rape, ended in a hung jury that 
favored the defendant by a vote of 10 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old alleged victim testified that she had been a virgin prior to 
the sexual encounter with the defendant, but that turned out not to be true. 
Nelson said the victim lost credibility with the jury, resulting in the 
deadlock. She believes the accused rapist is guilty. She said it is not 
significant that the loss was her final case in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson has not finalized any other career plans, but said she would like to 
write some academic papers on law enforcement and perhaps do some teaching. She 
is moving to San Luis Obispo, where her fiance lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who earned nearly $80,000 a year in Ventura County, said she has been 
contacted by other district attorneys in California about working in their 
offices. But she has so far resisted that temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her colleagues believe she is still one of the best prosecutors in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is really more like the prosecutorial version of Leslie Abramson," senior 
Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said, referring to the 
high-profile Los Angeles defense attorney representing murder suspect Erik 
Menendez. "I mean that in the sense that she is relentless." 
</P>
<P>
 As she prepared to leave, Nelson received an unusual parting gift from one 
defense attorney -- a teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago, Nelson was trying a case against that same attorney when the 
judge presented the teddy bear to the other attorney, who happened to be 
pregnant at the time. On Friday, that attorney passed the gift on to Nelson, 
who said she will give it to one of her three grandchildren.

MORE TEXACO FILES SEIZED IN SPILL INQUIRY; VENTURA: INVESTIGATORS SEEK 
INFORMATION THAT COULD SHOW COMPANY KNEW OF THE LEAK LONG BEFORE REPORTING IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State investigators served a second search warrant on Texaco's north Ventura 
offices Friday, seizing more maps, production records and maintenance reports 
for their investigation into a 370,000-gallon spill of a toxic petroleum 
byproduct that seeped into the area's ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen state Department of Fish and Game investigators searched 
three buildings at the Texaco facility late into the evening Friday, said Capt. 
Roger Reese, who heads Fish and Game's Ventura office. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said investigators were seeking documents that would show the amount of 
gas condensate lost in recent years from the facility and that could show the 
company knew about the spill long before reporting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco reported the spill in January, 1993, saying it was contained in a 
4-by-4-foot area. 
</P>
<P>
 But state investigators later found that so much of the toxic liquid had 
leaked that an underground water basin beneath the spill bore a slick many feet 
thick. Officials estimate it will take years to pump all of the toxic liquid 
out of the ground and clean up the site. Texaco has repeatedly denied both 
responsibility for the spill and the state's allegations that it knew about the 
spill before it was reported to authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 Reese said Friday that Texaco's denials were not believable. The company could 
not have lost so much of the valuable gasoline-like fuel without noticing it, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lost 370,000 gallons of a product that's worth a lot of money," he said. 
"Oil companies keep track of their products and generally keep very good 
records. . . .It's not plausible that they would not know they lost that much 
material."  
</P>
<P>
 Reese's statement was the strongest yet about the state's reasons for pursuing 
a criminal investigation against Texaco.  
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Fish and Game alleges that the material may have been 
leaking for months or even years before it was reported to authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not a matter of delay in reporting the (large) spill," Reese 
said. "It was never reported."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite several detailed allegations by investigators, Texaco officials 
declined to respond, except to generally deny any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The property borders Shell Oil and several other companies," said Texaco 
spokeswoman Faye Cox. "There are several different pipelines that cross the 
canyon owned by several different companies. We still haven't been able to 
determine the source of the spill." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators continue to be unsure about the size of the spill, relying on an 
estimate provided by a consulting firm that works for Texaco. In addition, 
investigators are unable to determine how much of the toxic liquid flowed down 
School Canyon Creek, past a housing development and into the Ventura River.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say it has taken them months to determine that the massive spill 
of the toxic liquid came from one of Texaco's pipelines and had seeped through 
the soil and settled into the canyon's ground water.  
</P>
<P>
 When Fish and Game investigators asked Texaco about the suspected leaky 
pipeline -- which had been repaired in recent years -- they were told by Texaco 
that it never carried the material, despite the fact that "Gas Condensate" was 
written on the pipeline, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that several boxes of documents were seized during their 
four-day search of Texaco's Ventura facilities but that it was still too soon 
to tell if criminal charges are warranted against the company.

 "We don't know what we found so I can't say the search strengthened our case 
any," Reese said. "It's going to take some very careful and complicated 
analysis before we know what we have."

GALLEGLY SAYS HE'S TOLD RADAR TOWER COULD BE MOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Friday that a top administrator with 
the National Weather Service has told him the government would consider 
relocating a radar tower on Sulphur Mountain if Ojai residents who oppose the 
structure can find the money to fund the move. 
</P>
<P>
 But weather service officials challenged Gallegly's statements and said the 
tower is staying right where it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he was told by Elbert W. Friday Jr., director of the National 
Weather Service, in a phone conversation on March 10 that if Ojai residents 
near the tower come up with the money, he would have the tower moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was getting back to me to advise me (about) a concern I had had," Gallegly 
said. "We went on discussing problems I saw the tower was creating in Ventura 
County, just kind of rehashing things." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Gallegly said, "He just came out of the blue and said, 'If J. R., or Mr. 
Hagman, would like to pay for it . . . I will be happy to move it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Friday could not be reached for comment, but a spokeswoman with the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the National Weather 
Service, questioned Gallegly's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not my understanding of the conversation," said Lori Arguelles, 
spokeswoman for the atmospheric administration. Despite what may or may not 
have been said in the conversation, she said, "the weather service has no plans 
to move the radar tower." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said the conversation occurred a few days after he and actor Larry 
Hagman held a press conference near Capitol Hill in Washington. Hagman lives 
near the tower and has joined other Upper Ojai residents who have rallied for 
its removal. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents have demanded for months that the weather-tracking system be 
relocated, claiming that microwave radiation from the tower is a threat to 
their health. Weather service officials last month conducted tests that they 
said showed the amount of radiation emitted by the tower is low and is not a 
health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he was told by Friday that the cost to move the tower would be 
about $500,000. "What's interesting is they said before it would cost $2 
million," Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the cost, residents said they don't have the money to pay for 
the move themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's arrogant to even consider that locals can raise that kind of money," 
resident Dale Givner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguelles said because there is no plan to move the tower, the government has 
not calculated a relocation cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguelles said the Sulphur Mountain site offers unique coverage of the Los 
Angeles Basin. The tower will replace an aging weather-tracking system in West 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only site that provides the right coverage," Arguelles said. 
"There were 30 sites that were looked at. Of those 30, this is the only one 
that provides adequate coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 The weather service does not expect the tower to be fully operational for 
another six to eight months, said Todd Morris, a meteorologist with the weather 
service in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no intentions of moving the weather system at this time," Morris 
said. "We have not even entertained the idea."  
</P>
<P>
 After his conversation with Friday, Gallegly said he faxed a letter to the 
weather service that stated: "I appreciate your offer to move the tower if 
alternative means of funding can be found. I intend to search for such 
alternatives, either here in Congress or in the local community." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said the weather service has not responded to that letter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arguelles said, "A response from Dr. Friday to the congressman is 
forthcoming." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly is one of several local and state officials who have joined the fight 
to move the 98-foot-tall radar tower, which was erected in November with no 
prior notice to nearby homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling themselves the Citizens Against Radiation Exposure, a group of 
residents rallied beneath the tower Friday afternoon, and are planning a public 
meeting in downtown Ojai later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to stop us from going gung-ho," Ojai resident Rick Loy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the challenge to Gallegly's comments by weather service officials, 
Upper Ojai residents said they see Gallegly's conversation with Friday as a 
small victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe what Rep. Gallegly said," resident Virginia Loy said. "With the 
National Weather Service's batting average for honesty and integrity, I don't 
doubt that they are taking back what they said to our congressman." 
</P>
<P>
 Givner agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gallegly's a smart individual, I don't think he'd just imagine (the 
conversation)," Givner said.

OFFICER SAW 'MOVEMENT,' SHOT WOMAN; CRIME: ANAHEIM DEPARTMENT VETERAN WAS 
PROTECTING HIMSELF WHEN HE KILLED CARJACK SUSPECT, POLICE SAY. SHE WAS NEAR THE 
CAR WITH AN ALLEGED ACCOMPLICE AFTER IT CRASHED ON FREEWAY SHOULDER.

<P>
 A veteran Anaheim police officer who shot and killed a carjacking suspect late 
Thursday night was acting to protect himself after seeing "some kind of 
movement" by the woman or a second suspect, Police Chief Dave S. Barr said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, there was some kind of movement that the officer was protecting 
himself from," said Barr, whose department is conducting a joint investigation 
into the shooting, along with the Anaheim Police Department and the Orange 
County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 No weapon was found on either the unidentified woman -- whom police described 
as a prostitute -- or her alleged accomplice, 32-year-old Timothy Mark Jackson 
of Compton, who was booked into the Anaheim City Jail on suspicion of homicide 
and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 La Palma police refused to disclose whether investigators had found a weapon 
during a daylong search for evidence Friday that followed Thursday night's 
chase of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began with the carjacking in an isolated area near an Anaheim 
motel and continued to the site of the shooting on the shoulder of the 
westbound Artesia Freeway, near the Valley View Street off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 But a source in the Anaheim Police Department said that investigators had 
found a weapon believed to be the one used to carjack the 1993 Ford Ranger from 
its unidentified driver on Beach Boulevard in Anaheim Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and the woman were reportedly both standing outside the stolen vehicle 
when the woman was killed by a single shot fired by an unidentified Anaheim 
police officer, according to Barr and La Palma Police Capt. Vince Giampa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the female and the male went down the embankment in a tumbling fashion," 
Barr said. "(Jackson) was taken into custody without any further incident at 
the bottom of the embankment." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all trying to determine what happened and why," Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began with the carjacking at 7:25 p.m. in front of the Rustic Inn 
in the 900 block of Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Giampa said the driver of the truck, an unidentified man, picked up the woman, 
who was hitchhiking on Beach Boulevard. She directed him to park in an isolated 
area near the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Jackson suddenly appeared, armed with a handgun, according to the 
victim. Jackson then ordered the man, who is in his 20s, out of the vehicle, 
according to the La Palma police statement. The woman drove away from the area 
with Jackson as a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 But the victim apparently didn't lose everything. A manager at the motel said 
Friday that the victim carried his surfboard into the motel with him, saying 
the carjacker had insisted on dumping it. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager said the victim came rushing into the motel and said his vehicle 
had just been stolen at gunpoint on the street outside. 
</P>
<P>
 An Anaheim police helicopter responding to the man's 911 call from the motel 
spotted a pickup truck matching the description of the carjacked vehicle at 
Beach Boulevard and the Artesia Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who was now driving, led officers onto the westbound Artesia Freeway, 
where the vehicle crashed into a call box on the freeway shoulder within the La 
Palma city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both occupants got out at that time and at that point the officer-involved 
shooting occurred," Giampa said. 
</P>
<P>
 La Palma police officers did not arrive on the scene until after the shooting, 
Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators searched the scene of the shooting for hours through early 
afternoon Friday, closing off the right lane of the westbound Artesia Freeway 
and backing up traffic for more than a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is being held in the Anaheim jail on suspicion of carjacking and 
homicide. Under the felony murder rule, a suspect can be charged with murder 
whenever someone is killed during the commission of certain felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was sentenced to prison for two years in 1987 for burglary and grand 
theft auto before being released in July, 1990, according to the California 
Department of Corrections. He returned to prison the same year, after being 
sentenced to three years for vehicle theft. He was released on parole in 
January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Anaheim Police Department refused to forward a Times 
reporter's request for an interview to Jackson "because of the nature of what 
happened," said Sgt. Phillip Lock. 
</P>
<P>
 Department policy allows visitors to be excluded "at the discretion" of the 
facility commander -- without any specific rationale. After the carjacking and 
shooting, Lock said, "we feel this is going to be a high-profile case, so we're 
not going to have a lawyer (for Jackson) yelling and screaming" because the 
suspect was allowed to talk about the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Police Chief Randy Gaston referred comment on the investigation to La 
Palma police because the shooting occurred in their city. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston said the officer, a sergeant with 21 years of experience, has been 
placed on paid administrative leave for three days, as is standard department 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office is investigating the shooting to determine 
whether there is any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, as it does in all 
officer-involved shootings under a county policy established in 1985. In all of 
the cases investigated since then, prosecutors have decided not to bring 
charges against the officers involved.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; POLICE ARREST 8 AT SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As St. Patrick's Day revelers took to bars and cars Thursday, Fullerton police 
operated their first sobriety checkpoint in nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The tally: Eight people were arrested on suspicion of driving under the 
influence and 28 were issued citations for driving without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 Police stopped cars traveling southbound on Harbor Boulevard between Valencia 
Drive and Orangethorpe Avenue, from 7 p.m. Thursday to 2 a.m. Friday. Police 
also distributed pamphlets from Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just as much public awareness as anything else," Fullerton Police Lt. 
Mike Stedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Officer Dan Hughes said he proposed the checkpoint after learning that 
most traffic accidents nationwide are caused by either drunk drivers or those 
driving without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, 72 people were killed and 3,558 were injured in Orange County by 
drunk drivers, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said he chose St. Patrick's Day for the checkpoint because statistics 
show that there are more alcohol-related accidents on holidays. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; TEACHER HAS PARTY OF THE CENTURY

<P>
 If Leone Jackson has learned anything in a century of living, it's how to have 
a birthday party with class. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding atop a white convertible Friday, Jackson cruised onto the Peters 
Elementary School campus, followed by a high school marching band.More than 700 
children cheered, wished her a happy birthday and showered her with homemade 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fitting for Jackson, who turns 100 years old today, to celebrate at 
school. A teacher since 1911, Jackson works part time as an English and Spanish 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jackson's granddaughter, Gwynne McGuire, is now a teacher at Peters 
Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real nice," Jackson said after the ceremony. She joked that few people 
would consider a 100th birthday "a cause for celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 Students called Jackson "Grandma" throughout the event and sang "Happy 
Birthday"' several times. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Jackson taught the students a short skit about the flag in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring from the school district in 1968, Jackson served as the oldest 
volunteer in the Peace Corps. JON NALICK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; STUDENTS GET GIFT FROM L.A. COUNTY

 Students at Atherwood Elementary School in Simi Valley got a pleasant 
aftershock from January's Northridge earthquake when a Los Angeles County 
school sent them money to fix equipment broken in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised, because they don't even know us and they sent money to help 
us," said sixth-grader Amanda Zopfi, president of the Atherwood Student 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels really special," added Rhiannon Snyder, a sixth-grader and the 
council secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 The check for $350 came from Melbourne Elementary School in Lakewood after 
students there conducted a "Quarters for Kids" drive, said Cynthia D. Regius, a 
Melbourne teacher and student council adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The children wanted to help a school that had been badly damaged by the 
6.8-magnitude quake, Regius said. She suggested Atherwood because her sister's 
children go there and Simi Valley did not get much attention on the news, 
Regius said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students learned that one person alone can't make much of a difference, 
but if we all get together we can," Regius said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Mellinger, Regius' nephew and treasurer of the student council, said he 
was surprised by the gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got $350 from quarters," the sixth-grader said. "That must have been a 
lot of kids helping." 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers and student council at Atherwood will work together to decide 
what the money should be used to replace, said Principal Beverly Radloff. The 
money could go to repair a new $200 overhead projector or any number of tape 
recorders and microscopes that broke in the earthquake, Radloff said. BRENDA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SHOW LOOKS AT LOCAL HERITAGE OF PORTUGUESE

 About 150 people attended the opening of a photo exhibit on Friday featuring 
the history of Ventura County's Portuguese community at the county's Museum of 
History and Art in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Descendants of Portuguese immigrants who once lived in the county came from 
across the state for the opening of the show, which will run through May 8. The 
exhibit drew members of the local Portuguese community as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Miller, 73, of Oxnard, gazed at the series of pictures of herself being 
crowned queen of a Portuguese festival in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is great to go back in time," Miller said Friday. "I still remember many 
of those festas (celebrations). But there are times that I was there, and I 
know I was there, but I can't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is the first in a series of shows featuring ethnic groups that the 
museum plans to put on once a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were many ethnic immigrants who came to Ventura County, and we don't 
know much about them," said Tim Schiffer, the museum curator in charge of the 
exhibit. "We hope to keep their history somewhat alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the early Portuguese immigrants in Ventura County have either 
moved away or assimilated into the mainstream culture, the 1990 U. S. census 
reports that 1,130 county residents are of Portuguese ancestry and 216 still 
speak Portuguese at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit features photos of Portuguese immigrants in Ventura County, dating 
back to the late 1800s. Some of the photos are of the Portuguese Holy Ghost 
festival, held annually in the county from 1924 to 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on display is a crown used to decorate the queen of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holy Ghost festival was born out of a tradition established by Portugal's 
Queen Isabel, who on Pentecost Sunday in 1296 was said to have placed the crown 
on the head of the poorest man in town and treated him like a king. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the exhibit, the museum plans a Portuguese celebration for 
April 10 from 2 to 4 p.m. The celebration will feature Portuguese music and 
dance. CHRISTINA LIMA

 Chuck Jordan, whose daughter was killed in a drive-by shooting nearly three 
years ago, will address Thousand Oaks' Crime Prevention Task Force on Thursday 
at 7 p.m. in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 He will show a video he recently filmed about Operation Permanent Cease Fire, 
his program to halt drive-by shootings.In the video, three convicts in prison 
discuss their support for Jordan's efforts to halt gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recruit ex- and active gang members to help me spread the word that 
drive-by shootings are not only immature, but also stupid, cowardly and 
insane," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I can do to bring my daughter back to life, but in her 
memory, I can stop people from killing their own little children, their 
brothers and sisters and neighbors," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, who lectures throughout Ventura and Los Angeles counties, said 
speaking before the Crime Prevention Task Force was like "preaching to the 
choir." His real goal, he said, was to reach citizens who have become apathetic 
or daunted by increasing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The apathy is our biggest problem, I think," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 After his speech, the Crime Prevention Task Force will hear a presentation 
about efforts to improve safety and living conditions at the Shadow Hills 
Apartment Complex. The meeting, chaired by Mayor Elois Zeanah, is open to the 
public. STEPHANIE SIMON

 The Westlake Village City Council has donated $1,000 to help restore Thousand 
Oaks' main library, which has been closed since January's earthquake ripped 
steel plates from the ceiling and ruptured a water pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting "in the spirit of neighborliness," Westlake Village Mayor Doug Yarrow 
presented a check to his Thousand Oaks counterpart at Tuesday night's City 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only touch that check for a minute, because I know our city finance 
director will be over here immediately," Mayor Elois Zeanah said, beaming as 
she accepted the gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 quake, dozens of Thousand Oaks residents have applied for 
library cards in Westlake Village, which are good at that city's year-old 
library plus 86 other branches in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 While Thousand Oaks charges non-residents a $55 fee for library cards, the Los 
Angeles County system offers free cards to everyone, even citizens of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake Village library, located at 4371 Park Terrace, contains 27,000 
volumes.  
</P>
<P>
 It is open from 1 to 8 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and from 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Thursdays and Fridays. The Thousand Oaks library is scheduled to open in 
mid-April. STEPHANIE SIMON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; FPPC COMPLAINT IS FILED IN COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A political opponent has filed a complaint with the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission alleging that City Council candidates Michael J. Doyle and 
Tracy Worley failed to report nearly $3,000 each in campaign contributions 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Davert, an attorney working as a volunteer for an opposing campaign, 
filed the complaint last week with the FPPC, alleging that a political action 
committee for city police officers spent nearly $6,000 on a February mailer 
containing pictures of Doyle and Worley, as well as statements from them. 
</P>
<P>
 The expenditure should have been reported by the candidates as a contribution, 
Davert said, because the mailers could not have been produced without their 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle and Worley have denied any wrongdoing. They said the complaint has no 
basis and is "politically motivated." John Adams, treasurer of the police 
officers PAC, said that the mailers contained information from Doyle's and 
Worley's campaign materials and were printed without their consent. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are challenging council members Leslie Anne Pontious and Charles E. 
Puckett for the two council seats at stake in the April 12 municipal election. 
Davert is volunteering on Pontious' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin Police Officers Assn. political action committee, which supports 
Doyle and Worley, was also named in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows political action committees, such as the police officers PAC, 
to spend money to nominate, elect or defeat a candidate as long as the expense 
is not made in consultation or cooperation with the candidate. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 2ND GROUP ASKS FOR CIVIL RIGHTS INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A second group has asked the U.S. attorney general to initiate a civil rights 
investigation into allegations that a landlord and property managers have 
harassed the owners of a Santa Ana jazz club because it attracts a largely 
black clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's co-owner, Santa Ana mayoral candidate Randell Young, filed a civil 
lawsuit in July against the property managers, New York-based Cushman & 
Wakefield, as well as former landlord Nansay USA of Santa Monica and current 
landlord Orix Corp., which is based in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the leaders of the League of United Latin American Citizens, or 
LULAC, said they have joined 100 Black Men of Orange County Inc. in calling for 
a federal civil rights investigation, alleging that the property owners and 
managers have repeatedly interfered with business at Randell's, a jazz club at 
Hutton Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Cushman & Wakefield, which manages the property for Orix, 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Yokeno, owner of Nansay USA, did not return several phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Berry, a spokesman for the Los Angeles office of the FBI, which conducts 
such investigations, said Friday the department had no knowledge of either 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's suit alleged that the defendants made threats against Young, scheduled 
maintenance to interfere with business during peak hours and refused to allow 
installation of cable services for Randell's. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Wednesday letter to Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, LULAC spokesman Arturo Montez 
said that the landlords and property managers "have violated the civil rights 
of the owners and minority patrons of Randell's . . . because its clientele 
consists largely of African Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 100 Black Men, a group of black leaders in the county, called 
for a similar civil rights investigation. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; RESURRECTING PASSION PLAY FOR ALL THE AGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sister Marie Therese Solomon knows that when times are bad, faith may wear 
thin. But determined to inspire those around her, she has written and produced 
a Passion play being performed tonight at Fullerton's Plummer Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Passion plays depict the trial, crucifixion and resurrection of Christ and 
were performed during the Middle Ages so European villagers could participate 
in the drama of Jesus' last days on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the play will touch people's hearts," said Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is based on a format popular in the late Middle Ages and performed 
today in cities throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time in a decade that Solomon has produced her play. And 
it's the only Passion play being performed in a non-church setting this season 
in Orange County, according to the Catholic Diocese of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The production, featuring an amateur cast of more than 80 people, still had 
some glitches during Thursday night's dress rehearsal. But the purpose of the 
play, said Solomon said, is to inspire the audience more than to awe them with 
technical perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 She first decided to produce the play about six months ago, and has overseen 
all aspects of its progress for the last three months -- right down to tying 
the armor on a Roman soldier and reminding actors not to miss their cues. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Trinidad, the nun has been with the Sisters of the Company of Mary 
for nearly 50 years. For more than two decades, she has taught youngsters and 
tended to Orange County's sick and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, she founded the Lestonnac Free Clinic in Orange, where she works five 
days a week providing free prenatal care, immunizations and other services to 
the poor. More than 30 doctors volunteer their help. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so poor, they come with their spirits all down," she said of the 
patients. But in addition to healing the body, Solomon said her clinic lifts 
the spirit. "You let them feel that somebody cares," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All proceeds from the play will be contributed to the clinic. The performance 
begins at 8 p.m. Tickets range from $10 for students to $18 and are available 
at the door.MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY TO HOLD ANNUAL LIFEGUARD TRYOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will hold its annual lifeguard tryouts Sunday morning near the 
Newport Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The rigorous test of physical stamina and swimming strength, plus a written 
quiz, will help officials in hiring 10 to 20 people for the summer lifeguard 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do one (test) every spring," said Lt. Jim Turner of the Newport Beach 
Marine Safety Division. "We are looking for the local aquatics athletes . . . 
from local high schools and colleges." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be an 800-yard swim, some running, and board paddling tests Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must turn 16 by July, 1994, and have good vision. The city hires 
both men and women for its lifeguard staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said that it is getting increasingly difficult to find strong swimmers 
to fill the open positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our applications have been reasonably slim" this year, he said. "It just 
seems that there are fewer people out there swimming."BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; COUNCIL ENDORSES GAY-PRIDE FESTIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling it a "healthy, fine event," the City Council has voted unanimously to 
support the city's first gay and lesbian festival, a two-day celebration in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's support was sought Tuesday night by the co-chairman of Laguna 
Outreach, a gay and lesbian community group sponsoring the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Reilly said the group wanted "moral support," not money, from the city in 
staging what they hope will become an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly said the festival will benefit local businesses and generate sales 
taxes for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to bring people here so they will understand what we have to 
offer," he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laguna Pride Weekend," as the event is being called, will be launched April 
29, with a party at the Boom Boom Room, a local gay bar that is one of the 
festival's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival itself will be held the next two days at the Festival of Arts 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Related celebrations will be held elsewhere in town, including a "Twilight 
Block Party" at the south end of town Saturday and Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it "a very fine proposal," Councilman Robert F. Gentry encouraged the 
council to support the event Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council commonly endorses local activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Outreach will seek support Thursday from the Chamber of Commerce.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CHEERLEADERS STAR IN THIS BIG GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE TASSY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not just shaking pompons and yelling "Go, team!" anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 With national competitions and magazines devoted to cheerleading, it's 
considered a sport by the 4,000 cheerleaders from more than 300 schools across 
the United States and Canada who descended Friday on the Anaheim Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 They're here for the two-day, ninth annual USA Nationals Competition. 
</P>
<P>
 As in team sports, cheerleading has junior varsity and varsity levels. And 
there are the injured bench-warmers and teary-eyed teammates frustrated with 
their performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "These girls take it very seriously," said Kenny Wardell, a spokesman for the 
United Spirit Assn., which sponsors the competition. "To them it's a sport." 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence is in the participants' training, performance and attitude, 
Wardell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But compared to other sports, cheerleading involves a lot of glamorizing and 
accessorizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, for example, many of the teen-agers' heads were smothered in big pink 
foam curlers. They had been wearing them all day so their ponytails would sport 
springy curls. 
</P>
<P>
 They came with their best faces on -- their smiles and make-up glowed for 
yards as they performed their high-spirited, brief routines. 
</P>
<P>
 Gestures have evolved from simple arm movements, tumbling and tossing, and 
standing on teammates' shoulders in arabesques. Now there are soloists and 
props, including tennis racquets and stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The complexity of the shows requires work and patience -- cheerleaders from 
Trabuco Hills High School in Mission Viejo said their coach trains them for 25 
hours each week. 
</P>
<P>
 To compete in this weekend's event, the Trabuco Hills squad first had to 
qualify in a regional competition. This is the squad's first trip to the 
national competition. 
</P>
<P>
 For 16-year-old squad member Shanna Alexander, dancing is the best part of 
being a cheerleader. Like many competitive athletes, she said that while 
waiting to perform she would "worry" and "see what the competition is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Harkins, one of Alexander's teammates, could not compete Friday. She 
hurt her knee skiing a month ago and the squad has had to re-choreograph some 
of its routines. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harkins -- with a big brace on her leg -- suited up in her blue and white 
sweater and short skirt anyway, to support her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Their slogan: "Blue, gray and white, let's fight, all right!" 
</P>
<P>
 According to former cheerleading judge Paul Marks, athletics are important in 
deciding who wins. Uniformity and strength of the movements, choreography, and 
recovery from any mistakes also count, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the winning junior varsity team from Friday's competition will give 
an exhibition, and the top varsity finalists will compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners will take home trophies and prizes from sponsors.ELAINE TASSY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; REPORT ON BIXBY PROJECT DUE IN APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The much-delayed environmental impact report for a proposal to build homes, 
apartments and a hotel in the College Park East neighborhood is expected to be 
released in April, city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been awaiting details about the proposed development, which is 
considered one of the city's largest in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bixby Co. wants to build 98 detached homes, about 100 condos or 
apartments, a hotel and a restaurant around an 18-hole golf course near the 
corner of Seal Beach Boulevard and Lampson Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Company and city officials had hoped to release the environmental report last 
fall. But the report was delayed, in part because Bixby decided to reduce the 
number of proposed detached homes from 168 to 98, said Lee Whittenberg, Seal 
Beach's planning director. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental study will assess how the development would affect traffic, 
pollution, noise and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The site of the development is just west of the Los Alamitos Armed Forces 
Reserve Center, which contains an airstrip used regularly by government planes 
and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study by the reserve center found that the base's operations -- 
including the flights -- do not pose a substantial safety risk to adjacent 
properties. The report also looked at the noise generated at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has asked the government for more details about the report's 
findings. Whittenberg said the city is concerned that the report based some of 
its conclusions on 1987 data when more recent information was available. SHELBY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; COUNTY TO PURSUE GOLF COURSE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that the money generated from a new 18-hole golf course at Camarillo 
Regional Park would benefit all county-sponsored recreation programs, the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors has authorized staff members to seek 
proposals from companies that may be interested in developing a course at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board, concerned that a new golf course would displace an archery club 
and a model aircraft flying club that use the park, directed staff members to 
work with the clubs in finding an acceptable place for relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The course would be on 327 acres of vacant land that the county targeted for a 
community park when it acquired the parcel in 1986. Because voters rejected a 
1990 bond measure that would have provided $1 million for recreational uses, 
the land has remained undeveloped, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The land is between the Camarillo Springs subdivision and the Camarillo State 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said Tuesday that she supported soliciting the 
proposals but wanted to look into the environmental impacts presented by the 
development of a golf course before any final decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Blake Boyle, the county's recreation manager, revenues from the 
new course are projected to range between $250,000 and $400,000 per year. 
Recent studies found that 65,000 golfers in the county play about 1.2 million 
rounds of the game annually. 
</P>
<P>
 A report on the proposals will be brought back before the supervisors in June, 
Boyle said. J. E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BOARD MAY REASSIGN SCHOOL OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura school board will on Tuesday consider reassigning some of the top 
officials at Ventura High School and replacing them with administrators who 
will improve the school's tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt.Joseph Spirito said he will ask the board to approve moving three to five 
of the school's administrators to other posts in the district. But he declined 
to say whether the list includes Principal Jerry Barshay. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Barshay, Ventura has two assistant principals -- Helena Torrez-Reaves 
and Diane Wootton -- and one acting assistant principal, Robert Beem. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the administrators moved from Ventura High will get other jobs in the 
district, and their new positions will not constitute demotions, Spirito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than punishing the school officials, Spirito said he just wants to 
replace them with other district employees who are better at public relations 
and will help improve the school's image. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ventura High's scores on the latest statewide assessment test were 
better than Buena High's in some areas, it has suffered for years from a public 
perception that it is academically inferior to its cross-town rival. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ventura High has been beset by problems in recent years, including the 
conviction last year of football coach Harvey Kochel for having sex with a 
15-year-old student and the suspension without pay of swim coach Dale Hahn over 
similar allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Ventura High students have been involved in some widely 
publicized racial incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the charges against both Kochel and Hahn stemmed from incidents that 
allegedly occurred before Barshay took over as principal three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking for a scapegoat and I'm not looking for a fall person," 
Spirito said. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 100 VALEX WORKERS STRIKE OVER CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 100 employees at Valex Corp., Ventura's second-largest manufacturing 
company, went on strike Friday after negotiations broke down over a labor 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, which covered machinists, welders and other blue-collar workers, 
expired at midnight Thursday and employees began picketing the building on 
Leland Street Friday morning.Valex manufactures stainless steel components for 
the semiconductor industry and employs about 180 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be out here as long as it takes," said Augustine Alfaro, a union 
representative for AFL-CIO Local 67. "The company is making a lot of money and 
the company is offering us 3%. It's really a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 The union is negotiating for a new three-year contract that would include a 
401K savings plan, two additional holidays and a 10% raise the first year, a 7% 
raise the second year and a 5% raise the third, Alfaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valex executives have offered a 3% raise for each year and the 401K plan but 
have rejected the holiday requests, said Valex President Dan Mangan.  
</P>
<P>
 Mangan declined to discuss the strike in detail or whether it has halted the 
company's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that we made a very fair offer, particularly considering the 
inflation rate and the overall economy in Southern California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro said the employees not on strike at Valex are office workers, who are 
not represented by the AFL-CIO. The last time Valex employees went on strike 
was seven years ago over similar issues, including salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Valex Corp. is a subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CLERK THREATENS SUIT IN PAY RAISE DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard City Clerk Daniel Martinez has warned Oxnard officials that he will sue 
for a pay raise deferred since last November unless the pay issue is promptly 
placed on the council agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying the city missed a 90-day deadline for resolving the matter, Martinez 
notified the city through his attorney Thursday that the city has illegally 
delayed a decision on his pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "How patient should I be?" Martinez asked Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving the letter, City Manager Thomas Frutchey said he plans to 
place a pay raise proposal on the April 5 council agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy stems from a council decision in November to drop automatic 5% 
raises for the clerk and treasurer after one year, and instead make the raises 
dependent on a performance review. Martinez finished his first year in office 
Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez contended the action could harm the independence of the two elected 
positions by injecting politics into the pay decision. His supporters accused 
Councilman Michael Plisky of opposing the automatic raise because of lingering 
rancor over the defeat of former clerk Mabi Covarrubias Plisky -- Plisky's wife 
-- by Martinez in the 1992 election. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff was supposed to return to the council with a pay proposal by late 
December so that council members could act by late February. But with no action 
yet, Martinez said Friday his patience has run out. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an ordinance on the books that says how this office should be run, 
including how it should be compensated," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said the dispute may be about pay, but it is not about money. He has 
promised to donate the salary increase to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael Plisky said he would not comment Friday because of the 
possible lawsuit, but Mayor Manuel Lopez -- who cast the lone vote against the 
pay deferral -- said Martinez deserves the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This all happened nine days before Daniel was supposed to get his raise," 
Lopez said. "I think we owe it to him." PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CHURCHES MAY OPEN IN INDUSTRIAL AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a request by church leaders, the Oxnard Planning Commission has 
approved a plan to allow churches to locate in the city's industrial areas and 
business parks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission rejected church officials' requests to allow 
church-sponsored schools in those areas, excepting Sunday schools.The measure 
goes next to the City Council for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was conceived in 1992, when Oxnard religious leaders asked the 
City Council to allow churches to buy property in industrial areas, which 
typically sells for less than land in commercial and residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Square-foot costs for industrial property tend to be half or a third of what 
commercial land is worth," said Jeffrey Brown of Calvary Chapel of Oxnard. "For 
many young, growing churches, just as with young families, the cost of land is 
prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Other major cities in Ventura County already allow churches to open in 
industrial areas, Planning Director Matt Winegar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners debated whether the presence of large assemblies near 
manufacturing plants could create the potential for hazardous situations. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, the commission agreed that the required review would guarantee 
that permits would be granted only when conditions are safe. PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; MERCHANTS TO HOLD GRAND OPENING 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fillmore merchants temporarily knocked out of business by the Jan. 17 
earthquake will hold a grand opening celebration today featuring sales on 
merchandise, hot dogs and balloons for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Store owners reopened their shops nearly three weeks ago in the temporary, 
tent-like structure called "Central Park Plaza I" and the trailers across the 
street called "Central Park Plaza II." 
</P>
<P>
 Other downtown merchants with little quake damage opened for business on 
Central Avenue the week of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's event, however, serves official notice to the community "that we're up 
and going," said Dale Crockett, owner of Dale Crockett Studio and president of 
the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce. Businesses from the plaza structures as well 
as ones still operating on Central Avenue will participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Crockett, like the 20 other store owners in the plaza structures, worked in 
downtown buildings that suffered too much cosmetic or structural damage to 
immediately reopen. Instead, the merchants moved into the city-financed plaza 
building, where many might end up staying as long as a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Crockett said some merchants have benefited from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think business is better now than it was before the quake," he said. "Like 
any mall or anything, we all work off each other's customers." CONSTANCE SOMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; WATER USE RESTRICTED WHILE REPAIRS MADE

<P>
 Irvine and South County residents are being asked not to water their lawns 
Monday through March 26 while inspections and repairs are being made to one of 
the area's major water pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Water officials want to reduce the demand that will be made on alternative 
water lines while the Allen-McCullough pipeline, the major source of imported 
water to the area, is out of service. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be no change in the level of service experienced by customers," 
said Karl Seckel, district engineer for the Municipal Water District of Orange 
County. "All the affected areas have alternate supply sources or will be 
relying on water in storage reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking for the outback in lawn watering to ensure that we don't put too 
great a strain on those alternate sources," Seckel said, "and still have 
adequate water for household and commercial use." 
</P>
<P>
 Communities affected by the temporary pipe closure include Irvine, Lake 
Forest, Mission Viejo, Aliso Viejo, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Trabuco 
Canyon, Coto de Caza, San Clemente and Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Work crews will be replacing a valve and performing routine inspections 
between Monday and March 26. FRANK MESSINA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; LOCAL LEADERS INVITED TO SCHOOL SCIENCE 
FAIR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As in many other school districts around Ventura County, Santa Paula schools 
are having a science fair this month in preparation for the countywide science 
exhibit in April. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Santa Paula Elementary School District is putting a new twist on its 
annual science fair. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have sent personal invitations to hundreds of local 
politicians, civic leaders and business people to attend the event, which will 
be held from 7:30 to 8:30 a.m. Wednesday at Barbara Webster School. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's science fair will feature about 2,000 projects from students in 
kindergarten through eighth grade. Sixth- through eighth-grade winners will be 
eligible to enter the Ventura County Science Fair on April 7 to 9 at the County 
Fairgrounds in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Supt. David Philips said school officials see the science fair as 
an opportunity to get community leaders more involved in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large number of business leaders in our town graduated from the schools 
here, and they probably haven't seen a science fair since they went to school," 
Philips said. MAIA DAVIS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; RESIDENTS TO PAY LESS FOR STREET SWEEPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 650 residents here soon will pay less for street sweeping. But 
businesses will pay more. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week unanimously voted to decrease the street-sweeping 
rates for residents who live on privately owned streets that are not cleaned by 
the city to $1 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, businesses will pay as much as $23 a month, depending on how much 
space they take up along city streets. Those with 300 to 500 feet of street 
frontage will continue to pay $2.50 a month, while those that measure 9,000 to 
10,000 feet will pay $23 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rates will be charged on the May utility bills. City officials said 
they adopted the new rates to appease residents who complained that existing 
fees were unfair.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SUPERVISORS REVISIT ANTI-FRAUD SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new anti-fraud system that would use fingerprinting to discourage welfare 
"double-dippers" is again being reviewed by county officials, who said the 
high-tech safeguard could be in place within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen months after the Board of Supervisors approved the system in concept, 
the panel will revisit the issue Tuesday when they consider a more detailed 
version of the $1.37-million plan. 
</P>
<P>
 By weeding out false claims among the more than 3,000 people who receive 
General Relief welfare payments each month in Orange County, the computerized 
system would save enough money to pay for itself in its first year of 
operation, county officials said. Within five years, the system will likely 
have saved more than $104,000 in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if a system like this would break even, cost-wise, it would be a 
worthwhile project from a public policy standpoint," said Bob Griffith, chief 
deputy director of county social services. "It demonstrates to the public that 
we are safeguarding their money from cheats and scoundrels." 
</P>
<P>
 The system is intended to reduce bogus claims for General Relief, a 
"last-resort" program that assists mostly unmarried adults without children. 
Recipients get about $300 a month in payments from the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Once set up, the process would only add a few minutes to the visit of 
first-time recipients, Griffith said. Recipients would be asked to put their 
index finger on a glass pane above a electronic eye. The image of the print is 
scanned and logged by the computer, which in a matter of seconds can compare it 
the thousands of prints stored in a database. 
</P>
<P>
 Fingerprinting stations would be set up in the county's Anaheim and Santa Ana 
offices. Griffith said the Orange County system will "piggyback" the identical, 
established system in Los Angeles, saving Orange County the cost of some setup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles connection will also allow the two neighboring counties to dip 
into the same database of fingerprints. Employees in offices in either county 
will be able to detect "repeat customers" who travel over the county line in an 
attempt to scam money from the social program. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, the use of the fingerprinting system has saved the 
welfare program more than $12 million and has been considered "extremely 
successful" since installation in 1992, said Lisa Nunez, a Los Angeles County 
computer services chief. The Los Angeles General Relief program assists more 
than 100,000 people from 14 offices. GEOFF BOUCHER

BOSNIAN WAR VICTIM RECEIVES SURGERY IN ORANGE; OPERATION: UCI MEDICAL CENTER 
SURGEON SAYS HE REMOVED SCAR TISSUE AND SHRAPNEL FROM THE PATIENT, WHO DID NOT 
NEED A NERVE GRAFT AFTER ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Vildana Jahic was walking to a friend's house last December in war-torn 
Sarajevo when the grenade hit. Unlike eight other Bosnians nearby, she survived 
the blast -- but it left 40 pieces of shrapnel in the 27-year-old woman's left 
arm, abdomen and face. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors in Sarajevo did their best for her, said her husband, Jasmin, and so 
did the doctors in Germany, where she went for six weeks. But her left arm's 
nerves were severely damaged, and a U. S. Army doctor told the young couple 
that for her to regain full use of that limb, she would need to go to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be in America to learn," said Jasmin Jahic, a mechanical 
engineer, in English learned only a year ago. He added, however, that he had 
not expected that it would take a difficult surgical procedure to bring him and 
his wife to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple are now residing in Orange as international refugees, and Vildana 
Jahic underwent four hours of surgery on Friday. It was to be a nerve graft, 
which only a few doctors in the nation can perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Israel Chambi, the surgeon, explained in a press conference Friday morning 
that he would remove a sensory nerve from her leg and attach it to the broken 
nerves in the left arm with sutures thinner than human hairs. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, it is a "routine" operation with a 75% chance of full nerve recovery 
for young and healthy patients who are treated within four months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chambi said at the end of the operation that he found that the nerves were 
actually not as damaged as they had seemed to be, and he did not have to 
perform the graft after all. He removed scar tissue that was pressuring the 
nerves, and shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt better not to have had to perform the nerve graft," he said. "She's 
already better. We noticed at the time of operation that the nerve conduit 
improved. . . . She will likely recover to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Physical therapy will only require three to six months, rather than a year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors in Germany had recommended either Columbia University or UCI 
Medical Center in Orange for the peripheral nerve graft procedure. UCI 
responded first, said spokesman Elliott Bloom. Through the International 
Organization for Migration, which works with Catholic Charities in Santa Ana, 
the couple were flown via military plane from Germany to Washington, then to 
Orange County, where they arrived Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As he waited patiently through the afternoon, Jasmin Jahic said the 12-hour 
flight had left them "tired, but because life (in Sarajevo) is hard -- this is 
nothing." He was optimistic for his wife: "I hope, I think she will be better 
than now." 
</P>

 Vildana Jahic will be able to leave the hospital a few hours after the 
surgery, according to Chambi, and the couple "will stay here legally," said 
Celine Prevost, coordinator of volunteers for resettlement and immigration for 
Catholic Charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The evacuation program is funding the couple through a grant from the U.S. 
State Department Bureau for Refugee Programs, and Chambi and the UCI Medical 
Center are providing the health care free of charge.

 "I really like it here," Jasmin Jahic said. "We have been here only two days, 
but all the people I met are beautiful people . . . kind."

FIRST-DEGREE MURDER CONVICTION REDUCED BY COUNTY JUDGE; COURTS: NEWBURY PARK 
MAN FACED 28 YEARS TO LIFE BUT NOW FACES A MAXIMUM OF 18 YEARS. THE RULING IS 
CALLED UNPRECEDENTED.

 Over strong objections from a prosecutor, a Ventura County judge Friday threw 
out a first-degree murder conviction that a jury had handed down to a Newbury 
Park man and instead found the defendant guilty of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Love faced 28 years to life in prison before Friday's decision by 
Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch. He now faces a maximum of 18 years, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran prosecutors called the judge's ruling unprecedented and said they 
could not recall another such decision in a Ventura County murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury found the 27-year-old Love guilty in December of fatally shooting his 
sister's boyfriend, Frank Kish, as 911 operators heard the shooting on the 
phone and recorded it on audio tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury decided against convicting Love of the lesser offense of 
second-degree murder, finding that he planned Kish's death after losing a 
fistfight to the victim and killed the victim deliberately.  
</P>
<P>
 Storch, however, ruled Friday that prosecutors had not proven that Love killed 
with premeditation. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge bristled at a prosecutor's suggestion that he had not thought long 
and hard about reducing the jury's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have listened to the (911) tape a half-dozen times," Storch responded. 
"I've reviewed the court transcript. I have thought about this case for weeks 
and weeks. This is not something I take lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 Storch said Love appeared to have killed Kish in the heat of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what happened in this case is the victim got the better of the (fist) 
fight, and your client could not handle it," the judge told defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch also said that under California law he is obligated to see that the 
jury's verdict is appropriate. "I think on this record to uphold murder in the 
first degree would be unjust," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley was visibly upset after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a judge to act as a 13th juror, it is the people's view that that's 
improper," Frawley said outside court. "It's rather incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said the district attorney's office 
will review the judge's decision to see if there is a basis for an appeal. 
"There's a very high likelihood that we will appeal," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two jurors who were contacted at their homes Friday expressed surprise by 
Storch's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "For crying out loud, he called 911 and told them what was going to happen," 
juror Melvin Popejoy of Oxnard said. "It looks to me like premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
 Popejoy said the jurors in the case were "pretty sure and pretty complete and 
unanimous. We went through every stage and read the law pertaining to the case 
and everything pointed to first degree." 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, I have no second guesses at the verdict," said juror 
Roger Hevley, a Navy meteorologist. "I think if we did it again, we would do it 
the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 During Love's trial, Deputy Public Defender Robert A. Dahlstedt argued that 
his client shot Kish in the stomach and head in self-defense. Attorneys hired 
by Love's family filed motions asking for a new trial and for a reduced 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlstedt said Friday that the judge did not go far enough in reducing the 
conviction. "I think it should have been manslaughter," Dahlstedt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlo A. Spiga, one of Love's new attorneys, said: "Something like this 
(Storch's ruling) just doesn't happen by accident. The judge has to really feel 
that an injustice had been done." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiga also said prosecutors initially offered to reduce charges to voluntary 
manslaughter in exchange for Love's guilty plea. Love rejected the offer 
because prosecutors could not guarantee him a reduced sentence, the attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelli Love, Love's sister and Kish's girlfriend, attended Friday's hearing 
along with her mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my brother," said Kelli, sobbing outside the courtroom. "He didn't 
mean it. This wasn't murder." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is a tragedy on both sides of the family," said Love's 
father, John.

SCHILLO REQUESTS ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY ON JANSS MALL PROJECT; BUSINESS: 
THOUSAND OAKS COUNCILMAN'S CALL COMES JUST DAYS BEFORE A SCHEDULED VOTE. 
ANALYSIS WOULD COST THOUSANDS AND MAY DELAY PLANNED EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just days before a scheduled vote on the Janss Mall expansion plan, Thousand 
Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo has requested an economic impact study to 
evaluate how a bigger shopping center would affect surrounding businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an analysis could take months and cost thousands of dollars. But Schillo 
said he needs to know whether the addition of major chains such as Mervyn's and 
Blockbuster Video would drive smaller stores out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The 120-page staff report does not address that issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how we can vote on it without an economic impact study," Schillo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers have cast their $50-million renovation proposal as a boon to 
local shoppers, city coffers and owners of the mom-and-pop stores now in the 
Janss Mall. Several longtime tenants also predict that a spruced-up center will 
attract more customers and boost everyone's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Schillo said he wants cold facts, not glowing forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to know, specifically, whether increased rents and sharper 
competition will fell some entrepreneurs still shaky from the lingering 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The city recently required developers of the Seventh-day Adventist property 
off Wendy Drive in Newbury Park to spend nearly $30,000 on an economic study. 
Due to be released soon, the study will analyze the expected effect of a 
proposed regional mall, including a Target store and a discount warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are we requiring one project to have an economic impact report and not 
the other?" Schillo said. "What's the basis? There's a certain amount of 
inconsistency there that I would like to address." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo's last-minute request drew ridicule from other council members -- 
and dismay from a Janss Mall representative. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of drafting blueprints and negotiating with tenants, the 
developers had hoped for speedy council approval so they could begin 
construction in June and complete the face lift by the summer of 1995. Pausing 
for an economic impact study would throw off that schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this late stage in the game, it would create some difficulties, I'm sure," 
project manager Steve Phillips said. "I don't think it's necessary to do a 
study like that for an existing mall. We're not increasing the square footage 
much, only 25%." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski agreed that renovations 
should not require economic impact reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Zeanah and Zukowski pushed hard for an economic analysis of the Adventist 
proposal but said they do not need a study to convince them that the Janss Mall 
expansion will be good for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo's 11th-hour call for an economic impact report bewildered some 
business people, who perceive him as generally pro-development. 
</P>
<P>
 To his surprise, Chamber of Commerce President Steve Rubenstein found himself 
supporting Zeanah and Zukowski -- the slow-growth council members he usually 
opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing the two politicians, Rubenstein said he backs the Janss Mall expansion 
wholeheartedly "because it's so obvious that what they're planning will benefit 
existing tenants and the community."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Schillo couched the issue as a matter of equity -- treating the Janss 
Mall and Adventist developers the same -- even the church's architect said he 
did not back the councilman's request. 
</P>
<P>
 The Adventists were willing to pay for an economic study because they hope to 
bring major new commercial development to Thousand Oaks, transforming an 
equestrian center into a regional mall, architect Francisco Behr said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Janss Mall project will merely expand a shopping center that's been 
around almost as long as the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't be fair to impose a study on them now," Behr said. "It would set 
a precedent if (council members) require such a significant piece of 
information at such a late date." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider Schillo's concerns and debate the Janss Mall 
expansion plan at a public hearing set for 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major issues include the size and location of mall tenants' signs. The 
Planning Commission denied a Mervyn's request for a prominent free-standing 
sign and extra-tall lettering on the building, spurring a complaint from the 
Janss Corp., which said its agreement with Mervyn's depended on highly visible 
signs.

24 LUMINARIES TO GET PASSES TO ARTS PLAZA GALA; THOUSAND OAKS: EVERY LIVING 
PRESIDENT IS ON THE LIST, AS ARE CITY, STATE AND FEDERAL POLITICIANS. ALL 
OTHERS WILL HAVE TO COUGH UP $100. 
</P>

 Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter will get free tickets. So will George Bush, 
Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 But should Tom Selleck, Sylvester Stallone or Sophia Loren want to attend the 
black-tie grand opening of Thousand Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza next fall, they will 
have to cough up $100 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to fashion a splashy, star-studded evening, residents organizing 
the Civic Arts Plaza fiesta have singled out 24 luminaries to receive free 
tickets. Every living President is on the list, as are city, state and federal 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Other dignitaries -- including the dozens of celebrities who live near 
Thousand Oaks -- will receive special invitations, but no complimentary passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the grand opening will take place just a few weeks before national 
elections, organizers figure they have a fair shot at luring some big-name 
politicians, who may be eager to hobnob with 1,800 well-heeled voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Attracting -- or at the very least, inviting -- stars from the political and 
cultural worlds "makes a statement about what we think this theater means to 
the city, the county and the region," said Everett Ascher, director of the 
Conejo Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be the most important theater between San Francisco and Los 
Angeles," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will review the VIP lists Tuesday during a meeting crammed 
with decisions about the grand opening celebration scheduled for Oct. 21 and 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost on the agenda will be consideration of a contract with Broadway 
performer Bernadette Peters, a singer and actress known for her eclectic, 
high-energy shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters has agreed to perform hourlong shows Friday and Saturday nights, 
appearing after the Conejo Symphony and local choirs present Beethoven's "Ode 
to Joy." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract up for council approval Tuesday calls for Peters to receive 
$60,000 -- and considerable star treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a two-bedroom suite plus eight single rooms with king-sized beds at the 
Westlake Hyatt Hotel. A dressing room stocked with six full-sized white bath 
towels, six bottles of premium beer, one gallon of spring water and one bottle 
of vintage California Chardonnay. An expense account of $5,000. And "adequate 
soap" for backstage bathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess stars have their idiosyncrasies, just like anyone else," Councilman 
Frank Schillo said, chuckling at the contract's detailed demands. "If it were 
me, I'd request six cans of Tab back there instead of the beer." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the contract, council members will vote on nine other issues 
relating to the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the issues, council members will approve the theme for the grand 
opening: "An Evening Under the Stars." They will weigh spending $106,000 on 
concert pianos. They will also consider plans for a children's art show during 
the grand opening weekend, featuring a sculpture of a lion made from recycled 
cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Once those details are settled, grand opening organizers will turn to the 
community to build excitement and support. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of commemorative pins bearing the Civic Arts Plaza logo will begin soon. 
For $150, boosters will be able to buy turquoise and purple banners advertising 
the grand opening. The banners will hang from street lights starting this 
summer, and sponsors will be able to retrieve them after the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250 residents have been working on the grand opening. Most feel 
certain they will attract sell-out audiences to both shows, plus a large crowd 
for the Sunday afternoon open house. Local officials -- even critics -- agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sure the community will turn out for this, regardless of any 
misgivings about the architecture," Mayor Elois Zeanah said. "It's the only 
cultural center we're ever going to have."

TWO COUSINS ARE FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN CAR; HOMICIDES: A FEMALE RELATIVE OF THE 
PAIR DISCOVERED THEIR BODIES. POLICE HAVE NO MOTIVE BUT RULE OUT GANG 
INVOLVEMENT.

 Two cousins were found shot to death in a car on Katella Avenue on Friday, and 
police were searching for their killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Julio Bautista, 26, and Benjamin Ibarra, 25, had been dead for 
several hours when a female relative discovered their bodies in a battered Ford 
Fairmont at 1:05 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The car was parked at a curb in front of a condominium complex at 2011 W. 
Katella Ave.One body was in the front seat, the other in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Steve Rodig, head of Anaheim's robbery-homicide unit, said no motive has 
been determined in the slayings, but gang involvement has been ruled out. He 
said it is also unclear whether the men were shot at the scene or if they were 
killed elsewhere and driven there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really can't say much at this time," Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove businessman Bill Roth said he was heading down Katella to meet 
his wife for lunch when "a hysterical" woman began frantically waving down 
traffic. He thought someone might be having a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have CPR training, so I pulled over," Roth said. "I pulled the guy in the 
front seat over, but it was pretty obvious there was nothing I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives at the scene said the men were recent immigrants from Michoacan, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Bautista, uncle of the 26-year-old victim, said "he was a very nice 
kid" who liked to hang around with his friends at a garage fixing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 While police examined the bodies, several residents of the condominium complex 
gathered in their driveway to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never had anything like this here," said one woman, who would not 
give her name. "It scares you."

<P>
 The light showers that began Friday night may continue over Orange County, off 
and on, throughout today and possibly into Sunday, according to WeatherData, 
which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Precipitation could reach one to two-tenths of an inch, said meteorologist 
Bruce Thoren. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really a major storm system," Thoren said, but winds could 
occasionally gust to 15-20 m.p.h.  
</P>
<P>
 The low-pressure system shows signs it will progressively move eastward over 
the next 12 to 24 hours, producing variable cloudiness.

 Highs today should get into the mid 60s to low 70s, with nighttime lows in the

3RD SUSPECT IN LAGUNA RAPE FOUND IN L.A. COUNTY JAIL; LAGUNA BEACH POLICE ON 
FRIDAY LOCATED THE THIRD SUSPECT IN A RAPE THAT OCCURRED LAST SUMMER ON 
CRESCENT BAY BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Robles, 22, a former Ontario resident, has been in the Los Angeles 
County Jail on separate charges since December. News of the warrant for his 
arrest helped police locate the suspect, and Laguna Beach detectives plan to 
interview him at the jail next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, Robles will face charges of rape, robbery, kidnaping, false 
imprisonment, assault with a deadly weapon and sodomy for his alleged role in 
the attack last July on a 20-year-old Pomona man and his 19-year-old La Habra 
girlfriend. The arrest warrant for those crimes carries $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they believe Robles actually committed the rape while two other 
young men restrained her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other suspects, a 17-year-old male and Floyd Robert Sullivan, 18, both 
Ontario residents, were arrested on the same charges Wednesday. Police at that 
time believed Robles was at large in Northern California, but on Friday 
discovered that he was in jail in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a spokeswoman at the L.A. County Jail, Robles is serving a 
one-year sentence for car theft and is scheduled to be released Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile suspect in the case, who was not identified because of his age, 
has pleaded not guilty to the charges and Sullivan faces arraignment next week, 
police said.

MAN ARRESTED IN BICYCLIST'S FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested a a 26-year-old man Friday in connection with the fatal 
drive-by shooting of a bicyclist in the 200 block of South Cliffrose Street on 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Graydon Marc Pfeiffer, 26, of Anaheim was arrested on suspicion of murder, 
Sgt. Craig Hunter said.He is being held at the Anaheim City Jail on $250,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the victim as Max Gail Downs, 23, also of Anaheim, who was 
riding his bicycle along Cliffrose about 8:35 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors in the quiet residential neighborhood said Friday they discovered 
the body and the bicycle about 9:30 p.m. the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on a bike and a guy drove by and shot at him," said Hunter, of the 
Police Department's gang detail. But Hunter said there was no evidence that the 
shooting was gang-related or that Pfeiffer was affiliated with any gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Early reports that a dog also had been shot to death proved untrue.

MAN DISCOVERS BODY OF CO-WORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was found dead in his living room Friday morning by a co-worker 
concerned about his failure to report to his job, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide investigators are looking into the death, said Santa Ana Police Sgt. 
Bob Helton, but it's not certain that foul play was involved.The cause of death 
has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not released the man's name, because relatives have not yet been 
notified. 
</P>
<P>
 The man lived at a large apartment complex in the 2400 block of North Tustin 
Avenue, Helton said.

MIKE DOWNEY: COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; BRUINS CAUGHT IN A 
HURRICANE; THEY LEFT HISTORY BEHIND 
</P>

 Outplayed, outcoached, outhustled, outmuscled, outmanned, outplanned and 
outrageously bad, UCLA is out of the NCAA basketball tournament and Jim Harrick 
is in for some serious flak. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach has to be held accountable for Friday's frightful first half and 
112-102 ouster by Tulsa, no matter why it happened, no matter what else 
happened this season. Harrick already knows what a lot of people are thinking, 
saying, "The players got 21 wins and the coaches got seven losses. That's 
generally the way things go." 
</P>
<P>
 This was no ordinary loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout 1,912 UCLA basketball games over 75 years, only once has any 
opponent scored as many points as Tulsa did. That opponent was Stanford and 
that 1987 game required two overtimes. 
</P>
<P>
 This one took 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with 20 minutes of the most pathetic basketball UCLA has ever played. 
It ended with Kevin Dempsey outscoring three of UCLA's starters, with Tyus 
Edney throwing towels and tantrums and with Ed O'Bannon saying how embarrassed 
he was to be out there. There was a moment when the score was 46-17 and it 
actually appeared that Tulsa might have to eventually take pity on UCLA and 
bench its starters so as not to run up the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to tell what Harrick could have done, short of head-butting his players. 
Nothing he did worked. 
</P>
<P>
 His job might not be in jeopardy, but his popularity is in double jeopardy and 
headed for final jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can imagine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA scored 102 points and was never in the game. Repeat: UCLA scored 102 
points and was never in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of the coaches insisted that there was a turning point when the Bruins 
could have cut the difference to 10 points and instead fouled their way into 
falling behind by 18. Yet, you know, when a day comes that a UCLA team has to 
regret not pulling within 10 points of Tulsa in an NCAA tournament game, then 
these are desperate days indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? Where did that 14-0 team go? Why did the top-ranked team in 
America disintegrate? How could it lose half of its last 14 games? What went so 
haywire that UCLA could fall 29 points behind a team that lost its last game of 
the season to Northern Iowa? How could college basketball's 10-time national 
champions have the floor mopped up with them by a school that had never 
advanced to the second round of the tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 Lowlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Edney with two turnovers in the first 30 seconds. Shon Tarver, slapping at a 
ball about to go out of bounds to UCLA on an over-and-back violation. Charles 
O'Bannon, fouling the shooter on a three-point basket. Edney, firing a chest 
pass to empty space. The whole team, going 2 1/2 minutes without a hoop, 
looking up and finding Tulsa in front, 10-0. This wasn't the Louisville game 
with the alibi of starting little-used seniors. This was UCLA's regular lineup, 
taking a beating. 
</P>
<P>
 It got worse: 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanza Johnson, 6 feet 4, tipping one in over Rodney Zimmerman, 6 feet 9. 
George Zidek, seven feet, shooting from 20 feet, throwing up bricks. Cameron 
Dollar, having his shot blocked. Tarver, shooting a foot long from 15 feet. 
Edney, blowing a wide-open layup, then having a teammate interfere with it on 
the rim. Dempsey, grabbing a beautiful rebound, only to ruin it by attempting a 
wild reverse layup. Ed O'Bannon, trying pop-top shots from behind the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 And worse: 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa players, not once but twice, pulling sleeper plays in the final seconds 
before halftime, slipping unguarded to the other end of the court while UCLA 
shooters were so busy shooting that they forgot to drop back on defense. Blown 
away by a Golden Hurricane, the Bruins gave up 63 points in 20 minutes to a 
team that Oklahoma State had held to 61 points over an entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa forward Gary Collier said, "There was this look in (UCLA's) eyes, like, 
'These guys can actually play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa did score 128 points in its season opener, but this was ridiculous. That 
was against Houston Baptist. UCLA is no Houston Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the Bruins do belong to the Pac-Your-Bags-10 Conference, where 
basketball teams don't hang around the postseason tournaments very long when 
there are national "powers" like Tulsa, Wisconsin Green Bay, Boston College and 
Fresno State waiting to be played. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver said the toughness of Tulsa didn't come as that much of a shock, 
because "it was only three years ago that we played Penn State and we lost." 
Ah, those golden tourney memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon, though, was aghast. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he found this loss embarrassing, O'Bannon said, "I was very, very 
embarrassed. I felt we were a much better team than what we were showing. I 
was. . . . Yeah, I was very embarrassed, to answer your question." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon did everything he could think of to wake up his brother Bruins, and 
not only his brother Charles. Ed slapped the basketball as hard as he could 
after snapping down a rebound, shook his fist, bumped chests, shook his finger 
in teammates' faces, worked and worked and worked. At one point he missed a 
shot along the baseline, then outran everyone else on the court to chase down 
another Tulsa sleeper and reject his shot on the far end of the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea that O'Bannon was that athletic, that he could play like that," 
Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, though, O'Bannon was saying, "About all there is to do now is 
finish up our quarter academically and then see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 He has a lot to think about. So does UCLA's coach and so do UCLA's fans. It 
will be a long time before any of them will forget what a bad day this was for 
Bruin basketball, this shootout they lost at an Oklahoma corral.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; BRUINS CAUGHT IN A HURRICANE; 
MIDWEST REGIONAL: UCLA HAS NO DEFENSE FOR HOT-SHOOTING TULSA IN RECORD-SETTING 
112-102 UPSET LOSS IN FIRST ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Now they know where Tulsa is. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA got a quick lesson in geography and fast-break basketball from the Tulsa 
Golden Hurricane, which blew the Bruins right out of the NCAA tournament, 
112-102, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a bad dream," Coach Jim Harrick said. "It was a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed a whole lot worse than that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were concerned about playing the game in Tulsa's back yard, but 
they could have played in John Wooden's back yard and it wouldn't have made any 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA set some team lows along the way. The Bruins actually trailed by 29 
points in the first half, had given up 63 points at the midway point, wound up 
giving up their most points in seven years and yielded the most points since 
UCLA started going to the tournament in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, it was a rousing defensive performance by the Bruins, who 
ended their season by dropping three of their last five and two in a row to 
conclude a mostly unsatisfying season at 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 From a 14-0 start, UCLA stumbled home 7-7 after Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sitting pretty 14 games into the season," said Charles O'Bannon. 
"We're the lowliest of the low right now." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon explained just how low that is. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to face the critics and everyone who is a basketball junkie who will 
tell us what we should have done," he said. "We've got a long, hard road 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 In this tournament, UCLA took a long road for a very short stay. 
</P>
<P>
 A season that included UCLA being the top-ranked team in the country ended 
with the No. 5-seeded team being shown the door by the Midwest Regional's 
12th-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not what Ed O'Bannon had in mind before the season began, when he 
said he thought the Bruins would be playing in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think the Final Four was out of the question, but the last part of 
the season, we didn't do anything," he said. "And this game was more of the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 More of nothing? Actually, it was too much of the same thing -- a docile Bruin 
defense overmatched against a springy Tulsa team led by Gary Collier, a 
6-foot-4 shooting machine who never took a shot he didn't like or couldn't 
make. He was nine for 16 against the Bruins, including four of eight 
three-pointers, and sank 12 of 13 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last big game of the season, Ed O'Bannon came up with a mammoth 
performance -- 30 points, 18 rebounds, six assists, four blocks, but Collier 
was slightly better than O'Bannon and certainly had a lot more help. 
</P>
<P>
 He produced 34 points in 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricane had runs of 10-0, 13-1, 10-0 and 8-0 in the first half, which 
ended with Tulsa basically out of sight, 63-38. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been worse. With 6:19 to go, Tulsa's lead was 29 points, 46-17. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, UCLA was devastated. Ed O'Bannon said he lost track of the deficit 
because "the numbers got so high." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a moment, though, in the second half that the numbers got so low 
that UCLA actually felt it had a chance to get back in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa's lead was down to 12, 72-60, with 11:53 to go, and Marquis Burns was 
standing at the free-throw line to shoot a one-and-one with a chance to cut 
UCLA's deficit to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burns missed the first free throw, and, at the other end, plowed into J.R. 
Rollo, who was setting a screen for Collier behind the three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier made the three-pointer, Tulsa got the ball again because of Burns' 
foul and Collier scored on a three-point play, fouled by Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an eight-point turnaround. Instead of being down by 10, UCLA trailed by 
18. That was it for the Bruins, who got no closer than seven points with 38 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa Coach Tubby Smith said he wasn't sure if his players breathed any easier 
at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it helped them," Smith said. "But it sure helped me." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though UCLA scored 64 points in the second half, the Bruins simply could 
not overcome 20 minutes of defensive sins. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Bannon had three steals, 12 rebounds and 15 points, but he was the 
only effective starter in a white uniform besides his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 George Zidek had eight points in 21 foul-shortened minutes, Shon Tarver had 11 
points in 33 minutes in his final game for UCLA and Tyus Edney, suffering from 
muscle spasms in his back, was way off form. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney, who thrives in an open-court transition game, made only four of 13 
shots and watched Alvin Williamson, his point guard counterpart, break loose 
for 20 points and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the crowd of 13,336 at the Myriad Convention Center cheered wildly, the 
underdog Hurricane of the Missouri Valley Conference scored a landmark victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa moved into the second round of the tournament for the first time. 
Tulsa's only other victory in the tournament was in 1955 against Southern 
Methodist in a consolation game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other dressing room under the stands at the far end of the court, UCLA 
faced the somber facts. It was UCLA's second first-round tournament defeat in 
four years, after an opening-round knockout by Penn State in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick adopted a philosophical stance afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just the way it goes sometimes," he said. "As I told our team 
afterward, this is a humbling game. I've been in it many years, and this one 
hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your whole season, everything is measured by the tournament. Now, we've got 
to sit back and wait a year for it to happen again. That's going to be very 
hard." The Lowdown 
</P>
<P>
 How bad was it? UCLA's 112-102 loss to Tulsa was something of a low-water 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most points against UCLA in seven years and 204 games, since Stanford scored 
116 in double overtime in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most points given up in a regulation game. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most points given up by UCLA in 29 years in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only the third time in 92 NCAA tournament games UCLA gave up 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most points UCLA gave up in a half this season, 63.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; NORTH CAROLINA SURGES, 71-51; EAST 
REGIONAL: TAR HEELS GO ON 16-0 RUN AFTER 16TH-SEEDED LIBERTY LEADS WITH 10 
MINUTES TO PLAY.

<P>
 Not even Jerry Falwell's pregame pleas for divine intervention -- and Lord 
knows, he tried -- could save Liberty University from a 71-51 loss to North 
Carolina at the NCAA East Regional on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Falwell, chancellor and founder of the fundamentalist Christian school, 
delivered the team prayer, but there are limitations. Burning bushes . . . the 
Red Sea parts . . . plagues are ordered -- sure, those things happen. But a No. 
16-seed like Liberty beating the No. 1-seeded Tar Heels? Never. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never faced 10 All-Americans before," said Liberty guard Matt 
Hildebrand, who led all scorers with 20 points. "There's probably more than 
that. I apologize to those I missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Hildebrand and the Flames (18-12) don't need to apologize for a 
thing. They led by four points with 15:10 remaining and by one with 10 minutes 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we weren't surprised," Liberty forward Jody Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hildebrand, sitting nearby, nearly fell off his chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little surprised, to tell the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This was North Carolina's 20th consecutive appearance in the tournament, an 
NCAA record. It was Liberty's first, though you wouldn't have known until 
midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 As snow fell outside, the Tar Heels (28-6) soon discovered that Liberty was 
serious. The first time Eric Montross, North Carolina's seven-foot center, went 
up for an easy layup, 6-10 Peter Aluma stuffed the shot into Montross' crewcut. 
Aluma later rejected another shot by 6-10 Rasheed Wallace, merely the most 
prized freshman starter in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their first time in the NCAAs, I thought they might have a little bit of 
jitters," said Montross, who finished with 17 points, 10 rebounds and three 
blocks for the defending national champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels' biggest lead of the first half was only six points, about a 
dozen points fewer than expected. Then came the barrage of dunks and 
three-pointers by Chapman and Hildebrand. Suddenly the Flames were ahead, 
40-36, with 15:10 to go and by 47-46 with 10 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting near courtside, his evangelical smile seemingly frozen in time, was 
Falwell. The school that requires its male students to wear ties to class, its 
female students to wear skirts, allows no alcohol on campus, has no co-ed dorms 
and holds mandatory thrice-weekly chapel services, was putting the fear of 
somebody into the Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up with 10 minutes to go and we were ahead in the game," Hildebrand 
said. "I was pretty excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that was before North Carolina Coach Dean Smith called for the Tar 
Heels to switch to a zone extended to the perimeter, which made it harder for 
Hildebrand and Chapman to make three-pointers. As the Flames began to miss from 
outside, Montross and Wallace started to assert themselves and the Tar Heels 
went on a 16-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 "God loves us all," Smith said. "You ask what I was thinking. I don't believe 
in a vengeful God." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels will play ninth-seeded Boston College on Sunday.

TENNIS GREAT VINES IS DEAD AT AGE 82; OBITUARY: THE FORMER U.S. AND WIMBLEDON 
CHAMPION HAD A SHORT BUT BRILLIANT CAREER BEFORE TURNING TO GOLF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ellsworth Vines, a legendary American tennis player who won three Grand Slam 
events in the early 1930s and also had a successful career as a pro golfer, 
died Thursday evening in La Quinta of complications of kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Vines, 82, had suffered a heart attack in 1988 and subsequently had kidney 
failure that required dialysis three times a week as an outpatient. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in Pasadena, went to Pasadena High and had a brief but brilliant 
career in tournament tennis. He won the U.S. Nationals, now the U.S. Open, in 
1931 and again in 1932, the year he also won Wimbledon. A right-hander who 
backed up an aggressive serve-and-volley style with fluid ground strokes, Vines 
was widely regarded by his peers as one of the greatest players ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kramer, longtime friend and one of the few considered to have reached the 
same level as Vines as a player, said Friday, "Perhaps the greatest compliment 
about Elly that I hear these days, when people talk about Pete Sampras, is that 
he plays like Elly did. Some of we older players aren't sure, of course, that 
Sampras is quite as good yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Mako of Los Angeles, former U.S. Open and Wimbledon doubles champion, who 
grew up playing against Vines at the old Pintoresca Courts on Fair Oaks and 
Washington in Pasadena, said, "Elly was one of the all-time great guys. If 
every athlete alive in the world today were like Elly, we'd have none of the 
problems we do today." 
</P>
<P>
 And Jackie Cooper, longtime tennis pro at La Quinta Resort, who established a 
Hall of Fame there for Vines in a special ceremony a few years ago, said, "He 
was my hero. He was the most humble champion I have ever known. With all he 
did, both in golf and tennis, he never thought he was a big shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Perry, British tennis great, once described Vines as "truly a meteoric 
flash across the sky of tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 And Don Budge, who came after Vines and before Kramer in the line of 
succession of star American players, once said he was hard-pressed to name a 
better player than Vines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a believer that things get better in time, but, today, I question whether 
the top player is as good as Vines," Budge said. "He was the best hitter of a 
tennis ball I've ever seen. When he was on, nobody could beat him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer once told a revealing story about Vines' pinpoint accuracy. After Vines 
had completed a clay-court match, officials had to redraw the chalk lines 
because Vines had erased them all with his shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Vines left tournament tennis in 1934 to become a professional, which meant he 
forfeited any chance to play events such as the U.S. Nationals or Wimbledon 
because they were for amateurs only. Instead, Vines joined the pro tour, which 
amounted to worldwide barnstorming matches against such foes as Bill Tilden, 
Budge and Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 At 49, Vines was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 1962. It probably 
was a surprise conclusion to an equally surprising career, one that began when 
his father took him along to the public tennis courts as a toddler. But Vines 
grew up without his father, who abandoned the family -- Ellsworth had a younger 
brother, Ed -- when Ellsworth was 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview nearly 70 years later, Vines said his drive to succeed might 
have been caused by his father's abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back on it after all these years, I think I wanted to prove to him 
that I could play, that I had some worth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vines was 17, he had already won the California high school championship. 
About that time, Mercer Beasley, Midwick Country Club tennis pro, spotted him 
at a junior tournament and began defining Vines' uniquely aggressive game. 
Beasley taught Vines to hit accurate shots by hanging a canvas over the net 
with holes the size of a watermelon cut out of each side and in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Vines: "My job was to put it through those holes." 
</P>
<P>
 Vines had grown to 6 feet 2 and 160 pounds when he entered USC on a tennis and 
basketball scholarship, but he stayed only one year. Perry T. Jones, the chief 
figure of junior tennis in Southern California, persuaded Vines to concentrate 
on tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1931, 19-year-old Vines was the dominant player on the summer tennis 
circuit. He won 13 consecutive tournaments, including the National Clay Court 
Championships in St. Louis, and entered the U.S. Nationals at Forest Hills as 
the top-seeded player. 
</P>
<P>
 Vines faced Perry in the semifinals. He lost the first two sets, then came 
back to post a 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 victory. Vines then defeated George M. 
Lott Jr., in the final, 7-9, 6-3, 9-7, 7-5, for his first Grand Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1932, Vines made his first trip to England and stunned the tennis world by 
winning at Wimbledon. He won the final in 42 minutes, 6-4, 6-2, 6-0, over Henry 
(Bunny) Austin and finished the match with an ace down the center of the court. 
According to legend, the ball was hit so hard, Austin never knew on which side 
of him the ball landed. 
</P>
<P>
 Vines went on to successfully defend his U.S. Nationals title with another 
straight-set victory in the final, this one a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, decision over 
Henri Cochet, one of France's famed Musketeers. 
</P>
<P>
 At 28, Vines abruptly quit tennis. He never played another competitive match 
and picked up the racket only for an occasional charity appearance. Instead, he 
thirsted for a new game and decided to try golf on the fledgling PGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he never won a tournament, Vines' consistency was remarkable. In the 
100 golf tournaments he played between 1940 and 1957, he finished in the top 20 
in 87 of them. He had 47 top-10 finishes, placed second six times and third 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
 He had his best result in a major tournament when he reached the semifinals of 
the 1951 PGA Championship at Oakmont Country Club in the days that tournament 
was match play. Vines lost to Walter Burkemo, who was defeated by Sam Snead for 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
 A former co-owner, with Perry, of the Beverly Hills Tennis Club, Vines later 
was the golf pro at the now-defunct Midwick in Alhambra, at the Denver Country 
Club, Wilshire Country Club and Tamarisk in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Vines' tennis legacy became dulled as years passed, perhaps 
because, as Perry said, his career came and went so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Vines is survived by his wife, Verle, and two children, son Ellsworth Jr. and 
daughter Edie. Services will be held April 1 at 2 p.m. at Church of Religious 
Science in Palm Desert.

NETS PUSH THE LAKERS AROUND; PRO BASKETBALL: NEW JERSEY'S PHYSICAL STYLE IS 
CREDITED BY PFUND FOR ITS 102-90 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 There had been an encouraging sign from the Lakers in recent days, a hint of 
the possibilities ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the playoffs? No. 
</P>
<P>
 Of an offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Friday night, when the New Jersey Nets came to the Forum looking for 
a return to defensive form and found the Lakers willing victims. The result was 
the Nets holding the same team that averaged 108.3 points the previous six 
games and scored a season-high 129 two nights earlier to the low 80s until 
garbage time, when they put the finishing touches on a 102-90 victory before 
12,251 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers scored 22, 22, 21 and 25 points against the Nets, who were coming 
off an uncharacteristic showing for one of Chuck Daly's teams in getting 
pounded Wednesday. That fourth quarter had the Lakers at 82 points before three 
meaningless baskets in the final 1:11 got the Lakers to 90. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just physical," Laker Coach Randy Pfund said. "Chuck's teams are 
always physical. They just don't let you feel comfortable. A lot of times there 
is bumping or banging. I'm not saying they foul all the time, but they just 
don't let you feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to win on the road unless you play great defense," Daly 
said. "We had to be much more aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Net Derrick Coleman, who had 25 points and 18 rebounds, both game highs: 
"He just told us we had to step up or else we were going to lose all three 
games on this road trip." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers trailed by as much as 79-65 before closing to 82-76. The deficit 
was still six with five minutes remaining when the Nets pulled away for good, 
capitalizing on Nick Van Exel missing back-to-back three-pointers, the latter 
an air ball, for a 94-81 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets began the three-game trip 5 1/2 games ahead of Charlotte for the 
eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff spot, but were slipping with each 
day. A 132-111 loss at Sacramento on Wednesday, the most points New Jersey has 
given up this season, cut the lead to 4 1/2 games, then the Hornets won at home 
Friday before tipoff in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the possibility of being only 3 1/2 games up, with a stop in 
Phoenix still ahead, the Nets responded by tightening their defense against the 
Lakers and giving up only 44 points in the first half. That, and a 10-3 rally 
the final 1:38, was worth a nine-point lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers trailed by 68-58 when Vlade Divac provided a temporary jump start, 
rebounding Coleman's shot and driving the length of the court for a dunk. He 
then blocked a shot by Benoit Benjamin and moments later delivered a long lead 
pass to George Lynch that resulted in a foul and one made free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought the Lakers within 68-61, but also marked their last points for 
about a minute and a half, part of a stretch of 2:25 without a field goal. By 
the end of the third quarter, the Nets had regained control, 75-65. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Winning has done strange things for the Lakers. First, Coach Randy Pfund 
shakes up the routine and lets players decide what time to arrive before the 
last two games, but only after detailed shootarounds both afternoons that go at 
least two hours. Friday, Pfund, disguising his voice with a country twang, 
phoned Chick Hearn and his pregame call-in show as R.C. from Inglewood. "Does 
he know what to do when you don't call down and tell him to call a timeout?" 
R.C. asked Hearn, known for his backseat coaching. Hearn said later: "I didn't 
pick up his voice. He asked me how I thought he was doing. Thank God I said 
OK." When Hearn finally realized it was Pfund on the line, he cracked, "Your 
parents are going to be ashamed of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sedale Threatt had climbed to No. 8 in the league in free-throw percentage at 
the start of the night, also on pace to easily break his career best of 83.3%, 
set in 1985-86 as a 76er.

MORNING BRIEFING: TEAM'S TRULY BAD NEWS WAS YET TO COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most surprised person when the College of Charleston made the NCAA 
tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the Cougars' coach, John Kresse, who was so sure his Cougars wouldn't 
make the field of 64, he called his former boss at St. John's, Lou Carnesecca, 
for help in getting an NIT bid. Kresse also told his players not to bother 
showing up Sunday at the restaurant where he watched the selection show with 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'We need not have you at a gathering where, if you don't see 
your name pop up, it would be a major bummer,' " Kresse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The major bummer occurred Thursday in a 68-58 loss to Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: In the 1957 NCAA basketball final, 7-foot-1 Wilt Chamberlain 
jumped center for Kansas. Who jumped for North Carolina? 
</P>
<P>
 He means it: It would figure that Gary Player of South Africa and one of the 
world's most traveled golfers would have a unique hazard on the course he built 
at Lost City in Sun City, Bophuthatswana. The sign reads "Danger. Do Not 
Approach or Enter the Crocodile Pond." 
</P>
<P>
 What lesson?NBA Commissioner David Stern talked at length with San Antonio's 
Dennis Rodman on Monday about his antics, which have brought five ejections 
this season. How well Rodman absorbed the lecture is open to question. He got 
another technical foul that night in a game at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey hotbed: When Bemidji State won the NCAA Division II hockey championship 
last weekend, it was no surprise. Bemidji is in Minnesota, which has a frozen 
pond or two. 
</P>
<P>
 It's opponent in the finals, though, was a hockey newcomer -- the University 
of Alabama Huntsville, where you never have to cut through ice to fish for 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Value lost: ABC Sports signed a five-year television deal with the U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn. on Tuesday, citing big Olympic TV ratings. On Wednesday, Tonya 
Harding resigned from the association as part of her plea bargain in the Nancy 
Kerrigan incident. With Kerrigan spending her time on television shows and 
peddling Walt Disney, wonder what that the TV deal is worth now? 
</P>
<P>
 Another sellout: Is nothing safe from commercial exploitation? The 
Oxford-Cambridge boat race, which has been contested for 165 years on the 
Thames in England, is now known as The Beefeater Oxford and Cambridge Boat 
Race. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Tommy Kearns, all of 5 feet 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Coach Ron Heflin on how Glenn Robinson, Purdue's All-American, 
handled sprint drills at Roosevelt High in Gary, Ind.: "Most freshmen will 
complain their stomach hurts or something. Glenn did it 40 times and was first 
all 40 times. I said to myself, 'Look what I got here.' " JIM HODGES

MIDWEST REGIONAL / AT OKLAHOMA CITY; NORTH CAROLINA A&T MAKES ARKANSAS WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What was North Carolina A&T's chance of winning the NCAA title? 
</P>
<P>
 A trillion to one, according to handicappers, who were probably choking on 
their odds for a while Friday night before No. 2-ranked Arkansas pulled away, 
94-79, in the first round of the Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies (16-14), winners of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament, 
went on a 13-0 run, led 18-17 and trailed by only four points at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas (26-3) got 24 points from Corliss Williamson and moved into a 
second-round matchup with Georgetown, but it wasn't easy despite the 
Razorbacks' 12-point lead at the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did look like they were going to blow us out from the start, but I looked 
at our kids and they played their way out of it," said Aggie Coach Jeff Capel. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Bunn, a 6-6 freshman, scored 20 points and had 12 rebounds for the Aggies, 
who failed to become the first No. 16-seeded team to win a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgetown 84, Illinois 77 
</P>
<P>
 Who beat the Fighting Illini? The Butler did it. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game of eight ties and 23 lead changes, George Butler scored his season 
high of 27 points and the Hoyas (19-11) moved on to a second-round game against 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 While Georgetown's Othella Harrington struggled with 11 points, five rebounds 
and six turnovers, Butler carried the offensive load. A junior college 
transfer, Butler made nine of 17 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to step up and hit a couple of big shots," Butler said. "I just 
came through." 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois (17-11) committed 23 turnovers and failed to come through, although 
Deon Thomas did his best. Thomas finished his college career with 19 points and 
10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State 65, New Mexico State 55 
</P>
<P>
 It was supposed to be Bryant Reeves' show, but 185-pound guard Randy 
Rutherford overshadowed his seven-foot, 290-pound teammate with 28 points in 
the Cowboys' victory over the Aggies (23-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State (24-9) will play Tulsa in the second-round Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Working against a matchup zone, Reeves took only five shots, two in the second 
half, but it didn't matter because the Aggie offense produced one basket -- a 
three-pointer -- in the last 7:58. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State led, 53-52, at that point, but outscored New Mexico State, 
12-3, afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got frustrating at times, but yet we won the game, so I've got to be happy 
with that," said Reeves, who had 11 points.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; WEST REGIONAL / AT 
SACRAMENTO; OLSON MAKES CERTAIN ARIZONA IS ABLE TO PLAY ANOTHER DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it was overkill, but when you've been embarrassed two years in a row, 
the memory lingers and a reputation is earned. Radio talk shows make sure of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona lost to East Tennessee State in the first round of the NCAA tournament 
as a third-seeded team in 1992 and to Santa Clara while second-seeded in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 So when 15th-seeded Loyola of Maryland was being blown out by second-seeded 
Arizona in the closing minutes Friday at Sacramento, the Greyhounds still 
looked like Duke to Wildcat Coach Lute Olson. 
</P>
<P>
 He kept three starters in until 1:40 remained in an 81-55 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past we lost in the first round, and I didn't want it to happen 
again," said Khalid Reeves, a senior who led the Wildcats with 32 points and 
spoke Olson's mind. "Now we have a game to play on Sunday. We can't relax." 
</P>
<P>
 That game is against Virginia, a 57-54 winner over New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (17-13) is a 3,000-student school in Baltimore that was making its 
first trip to the NCAA tournament. It was so financially strapped that it 
rented Virginia's band rather than fly its own across country. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Remember East Tennessee and Santa Clara? 
</P>
<P>
 Olson does, so he took no chances, having the Wildcats (26-5) press from the 
opening moments. Loyola scored the first basket, then few others as Arizona 
gained a 39-22 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the press might have been too much. Loyola still failed to score for 
6 minutes 10 seconds after the Wildcats abandoned it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greyhounds, who shot only 24%, were led by Tracy Bergan's 17 points. Their 
first basket of the second half didn't come until the 15:50 mark, when Milton 
Williams made a three-pointer to make it 49-25. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory left the Wildcats as the only surviving Pacific 10 team in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia 57, New Mexico 54 -- Jason Williford's offensive rebound and basket 
with 46 seconds to play gave the Cavaliers their first lead of the second half. 
It was only his second basket of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Deane added two free throws to ice the victory for Virginia (18-12) of 
the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger and heavier Cavaliers wore down a fast and scrappy New Mexico 
(23-8) team that held second-half leads as big as 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico of the Western Athletic Conference made only six of 25 three-point 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville 67, Boise State 58 -- Clifford Rozier's 18 points helped the 
third-seeded Cardinals hold off an impressive second-half rally by 14th-seeded 
Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos (17-13) used six three-pointers in the second half to storm back 
from a 49-27 deficit. An 11-0 run got Boise rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Two three-pointers by Shambric Williams cut the margin to 60-55, and his 
three-point play made it 62-58 with 29 seconds to go before the Boise drive 
stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville (27-5) will meet Minnesota in Sunday's second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 74, Southern Illinois 60 -- Voshon Lenard scored 18 points, Arriel 
McDonald 15 and the sixth-seeded Golden Gophers (21-11) went on a 20-0 run in 
the first half in beating the Salukis. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss snapped an eight-game winning streak for 11th-seeded Southern 
Illinois (23-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Lowery led the error-prone Salukis with 19 points.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; SOUTHEAST REGIONAL / AT ST. 
PETERSBURG, FLA.; ROGERS GETS A LOOK AT THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you've put together game plans to deal with the world's best basketball 
players, are you going to have trouble preparing for Carlos Rogers? 
</P>
<P>
 Not Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino, former New York Knick coach. "When I was 
coaching in the NBA, you knew you've got to stop (Michael) Jordan, you've got 
to stop (Larry) Bird," said Pitino after his Wildcats defeated Tennessee State, 
83-70, in the first round of the Southeast Regional Friday at St. Petersburg, 
Fla. "Our philosophy is to take the opposition out of what they do best. We 
felt what they did best was to go to Carlos Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, a 6-foot-11 center, is projected as a first-round NBA draft pick, and 
he experienced the treatment he can expect at the next level. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Riddick, Rodrick Rhodes and the rest of the Wildcats hounded Rogers, who 
had 11 turnovers, a technical foul and an outburst of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're killing me! They're killing me!" Rogers shouted after being called 
for a foul. 
</P>
<P>
 They were also holding him to 15 points, 10 below his average, and only 10 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The technical foul midway through the second half came for slamming down the 
ball after he was called for a foul. In the next two minutes, Rogers twice had 
to be separated from Kentucky players after hard contact. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had three people on you, you'd get uptight too," Rogers said. "The 
frustration had a tendency to set in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just saying, 'God, man, if I'm guarding someone one-on-one, why can't 
they guard me one-on-one?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because that's not the way the game is played when the opposition is a one-man 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt the best way to take it to a shot blocker was to take it to his 
face," Pitino said. "Andre did a great job of taking it to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Riddick, a junior center, scored a career-high 22 points and Rhodes also had 
22 for Kentucky (27-6). 
</P>
<P>
 The third-seeded Wildcats will play No. 21 Marquette in Sunday's second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Davis scored 17 points for the Tigers (19-12). 
</P>
<P>
 Marquette 81, Southwestern Louisiana 59 -- The Warriors found the answer to 
Southwestern Louisiana's full-court offense with patience and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Key scored 24 points and led a 19-0 second-half run that enabled 
Marquette (23-8), seeded sixth, to pull away from the Ragin' Cajuns (22-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Key scored 13 points in the second half and also had 12 rebounds for 
Marquette, which shot 51% after making only 38% and falling behind at halftime, 
34-31. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke 82, Texas Southern 70 -- The Blue Devils, criticized by Coach Mike 
Krzyzewski for a lack of intensity in late-season losses to North Carolina and 
Virginia, turned it up in winning in the opening round for the 10th consecutive 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke (24-5) got 20 points from Chris Collins, 17 in the first half when the 
Blue Devils held a 45-33 lead over the Tigers (19-11). All-American Grant Hill, 
content with directing the Duke offense rather than trying to score, had 11 
points, nine rebounds and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State 84, Seton Hall 73 -- Shawn Respert scored 25 points and the 
Spartans held Seton Hall without a basket for nine minutes to start the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State (20-11) advanced to Sunday's game against Duke by turning a 
one-point halftime lead into a 19-point advantage and then coasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturas Karnishovas scored 23 points for Seton Hall (17-13).

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; WOMEN'S TOURNAMENT / MIDEAST 
REGIONAL; USC RETURNS TO ACTION IN CHASE FOR TITLE

 The USC women's basketball team, winner of five consecutive games since Coach 
Cheryl Miller predicted her team would not lose again this season, will play 
George Washington tonight at 7:30 in a second-round NCAA tournament game at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (24-3), ranked seventh in the final regular-season poll, meets the 
unranked Colonials (23-7) after defeating Portland, 77-62, on Thursday.George 
Washington, co-champion of the Atlantic 10 Conference, defeated Alabama 
Birmingham in its NCAA opener, 74-66. 
</P>
<P>
 With a victory tonight in senior All-American Lisa Leslie's final home game, 
the Trojans would advance to the Mideast Regional next week at the University 
of Arkansas.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller's team completed a 16-2 Pacific 10 championship season last weekend, 
but the Trojans have not played well in their last two, victories over Oregon 
State and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, USC has lost much of the sizzle from its early- and midseason 
offense, and specifically its long-range shooting touch in recent outings. In 
practice this week, Miller has focused on shooting, lost timing and intensity.  
</P>
<P>
 George Washington lost to Rutgers in its conference tournament title game, 
79-71. Junior forward Darlene Saar is the Colonials' best player, averaging 
13.1 points and 8.8 rebounds.

NEWSWIRE: BASEBALL PROFITS DECLINED BY 78% IN 1992

 The average baseball player salary increased to $1,028,667, and because of 
that the operating profit of the major league clubs declined 78% in 1992, 
according to audited figures released by the Associated Press on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The year is the most recent one for which audited figures are available. 
Because each club uses its own accounting system, the 1993 figures will not be 
available until late this year or in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball made $1.66 billion in 1992, an 8.2% increase, but earned only $22.2 
million because player costs rose $177 million, to 55.2% of revenue, the 
figures showed. The teams had earned $98.53 million in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners have approved a revenue-sharing plan to help teams in the poorer 
markets, with the idea of presenting it to the players' union to seek agreement 
on a salary cap in hopes of stopping an erosion of profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures showed that the eight largest teams in 1992 made a profit of 
$60.29 million, but that the other 18 clubs lost an aggregate $38.08 million. 
Football

<P>
 Unable to sign Tim Brown from the Raiders, the Denver Broncos instead signed

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / DIVISION II STATE CHAMPIONSHIP; IRVINE WOODBRIDGE WILTS 
UNDER EARLY PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After winning 32 games in a row, the Irvine Woodbridge High girls' basketball 
team did not know how to react when it faced defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors jumped to an early lead against Sacramento El Camino in the State 
Division II championship Friday at the Oakland Coliseum, then folded once they 
fell behind in the second quarter in a 71-38 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles finished with a 36-0 record, winning their first State title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each week we kept playing a step above our competition," said Bill Bazter, El 
Camino coach. "Woodbridge was the best team we've faced all season, and our 
team really stepped it up. I think we might be one of the top 20 teams in the 
country right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge (32-1) was also making its first appearance in a State final. Its 
coach, Eric Bangs, can take solace in that he will have four starters back next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got beat by a much better team, so I'm not going to try and make any 
excuses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared Bangs would be looking forward to an undefeated season early on as 
the Warriors took a 13-6 lead, dominating the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woodbridge struggled the rest of the game, scoring only six points in each 
the second and third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino shut down the Warriors' press and effectively worked its running 
game. Senior guard Kristin Niemann scored 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge, Southern Section Division II-AA champion, could not adjust to El 
Camino's aggressive defense. It shot 24% from the field, and made only one of 
16 three-point attempts. It also turned the ball over 22 times.

 Eli Anderson scored a game-high 19 points to lead Bakersfield East High to a 
68-59 victory over Roseville Oakmont in the State Division II boys' 
championship game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 6,640 at the Oakland Coliseum Arena, East (29-4) broke open a close 
game in the second quarter by outscoring Oakmont, 19-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Flood and Whitney Brake led Oakmont (31-4) with 14 and 12 points, 
respectively.

 San Diego Lincoln Prep 63, San Anselmo Sir Francis Drake 50 -- Mark Sanford, a 
6-foot-8 senior center, scored a game-high 18 points to lead Lincoln (25-7) to 
the Division IV championship at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake was overpowered from the start as Lincoln took a 24-10 halftime lead. 
Lincoln led by as many as 20 points and Drake never got closer than seven in 
the second half.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / DIVISION IV STATE FINAL; ST. BERNARD REPEATS AS CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No matter that the Playa del Rey St. Bernard girls' basketball team lost four 
of its five starters from last season's State Division IV championship team 
because of graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter because the player the Vikings had returning was Olympia Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott led St. Bernard to its second consecutive title when it defeated Grass 
Valley Bear River, 53-43, Friday at the Oakland Coliseum in a rematch of last 
season's final. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, a 6-foot-2 senior forward, and Marte Alexander, a 6-4 senior center, 
each scored 14 points to lead the Vikings (28-4). Scott also had a game-high 20 
rebounds, including nine offensive boards. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard did not take control until the fourth quarter. With St. Bernard 
trailing, 43-39, Alexander and Scott combined for 10 points as the Vikings 
scored the final 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, I think they were a good team, but I don't think they were the better 
team," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took St. Bernard a while to prove that. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 31-31, Scott made a short jumper with 23 seconds 
remaining in the third quarter to put St. Bernard ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jenny Shayani (33 points) made two free throws and a layup to give Bear 
River (34-4) the lead, 35-33, at the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard came back to tie the score, 39-39, with 5:40 left. Lara Wicks and 
Shayani each made layups in the next 1:16, to give Bear River a 43-39 lead, but 
it did not score again. 
</P>
<P>
 For St. Bernard, the game ended an era. Scott will head to Stanford next 
season and Alexander will head to Arizona.

GOLF ROUNDUP; PRICE OPENS DOOR FOR LEADERS

<P>
 Vijay Singh, Larry Mize and Andrew Magee vaulted into a three-way share of the 
lead at the halfway point of the Nestle Invitational Friday when Nick Price 
took four to get down from a greenside bunker on the 18th hole of Arnold 
Palmer's Bay Hill Club at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "All in all, I'm not unhappy," said Price, a winner last week in the Honda 
Classic. "If I'd lost the tournament right there it'd be something else, but 
there's two rounds left." 
</P>
<P>
 Singh, of Fiji, who began his American tour career in this tournament a year 
ago, shot a five-under-par 67 to share the top spot with Mize (69) and Magee 
(67) at seven-under 137 for 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, the first-round leader, took a double-bogey on the final hole and shot 
a 72 that left him tied at 138 with Glen Day (68). 
</P>
<P>
 Price was cruising along in the lead until he came to the 441-yard finishing 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 He pulled his drive into the rough and then buried a seven-iron second in the 
face of a steep bunker. He came out 50 feet long, lagged up to four feet and 
then missed that one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six, as quick as that," he said. "A little disappointing. But I'll take two 
more scores like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Singh, who tied for second in this event a year ago, holed a 30-yard sand shot 
for a birdie on the 10th and got up and down from a bunker for birdie on the 
12th. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Nancy Lopez tied a tournament-record with an eight-under-par 65, but fell just 
short of the lead in the Standard Register Ping tournament at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Robbins and Connie Chillemi each shot 70 to share the lead at 
eight-under 138 at the halfway mark. They started the second round a shot 
behind Caroline Keggi and finished with a one-stroke lead over Keggi (72) and 
Cindy Schreyer (70). 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who shot a 75 the first day, tied the course and tournament records set 
by Amy Alcott in 1988 and matched by Patty Sheehan last year. It left Lopez 
tied with Brandie Burton, Hiromi Kobayashi and Chris Johnson at 140.

TENNIS; SAMPRAS WILL DEFEND TITLE AGAINST AGASSI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Sampras mixed aces, baseline winners, cross-court volleys and overheads. 
Jim Courier hit one forehand after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras outlasted his childhood friend and longtime rival in an 18-minute 
tiebreaker Friday to win, 6-4, 7-6 (12-10), in the semifinals of the Lipton 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked defending champion, Sampras overcame three set points in the 
tiebreaker and beat Courier for the fourth consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think either of us played that great," Sampras said. "I got lucky. 
That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sampras also showed a complete arsenal of shots. Less lethal with his 
serve than usual, he was forced to win points from the baseline, where Courier 
prefers to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras will seek his fourth tournament title this year in Sunday's final 
against Andre Agassi, who advanced by beating Australian Patrick Rafter 6-2, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras is attempting to become the first player to win consecutive men's 
singles titles at Lipton. He has split eight previous matches against Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some pretty entertaining matches in the past," Agassi said. "It's 
explosive tennis when we play.' 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's final today, top-ranked Steffi Graf, winner of 31 consecutive 
matches, meets Natalia Zvereva, who is 0-13 lifetime against Graf.

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; AGASSI, SHIELDS: THE GRAND SLAM OF LOVE MATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was all there in the National Enquirer: "Rush Limbaugh's Secret 
Bride-to-Be' . . . "Tonya: Her Life in Photos' . . . "The Evil Spy Who Betrayed 
America Was Really a Henpecked Wimp." 
</P>
<P>
 And the one that caught our eye: "Brooke Shields and Andre Agassi: 'We're So 
Much in Love.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, reports the Enquirer, the Zen Master and the seldom-seen-on-the-screen 
actress are an item. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andre and Brooke are boyfriend and girlfriend," Phillip Agassi, older brother 
of the former Wimbledon champion and manager of Agassi Enterprises, said from 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the article, Andre is quoted as saying, "I'm in love with Brooke. She's 
very special -- and she's added a lot to my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Babbles Brooke: "Andre Agassi is the love of my life! We're so much in love -- 
and I hope this feeling goes on forever!" 
</P>
<P>
 Shields, who is five years older than the 23-year-old Agassi, said that their 
romance began with a fax, that they see each other every couple of weeks, love 
to go to movies and eat at Wendy's and have been dating for about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this goes well," she said, "I'd like to be married by the time I'm 30, 
then have two or three children." 
</P>
<P>
 After she had foot surgery recently, Shields said, Agassi jetted to her side 
when she had a severe reaction to medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "I vomited constantly," she said. "Andre held my head when I was sick and 
carried me back and forth to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it romantic? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eye, eye, eye: After losing to Pete Sampras in the semifinals of the Newsweek 
Champions Cup at Indian Wells, Stefan Edberg was kept on the court to receive a 
"nicest eyes" award from a tournament sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of sportsmanship awards," Edberg said, "but this is a new one 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 What's next, best buns? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just wondering: As he prepared to serve during a match against Petr Korda in 
the Newsweek Champions Cup, Todd Martin heard a spectator call out from the 
stands, "We're all with you, Todd." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the point, Martin returned to the service line, looked up and 
asked: "Are you still with me?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Never say never: Sampras says the most imposing obstacle in his pursuit of a 
Grand Slam will be the French Open. His victory at Kitzbuehel, Austria, in 1992 
was the only one of his 23 titles that was won on clay, and he has not advanced 
beyond the quarterfinals at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a bit vulnerable on the clay," said Sampras, who has won the sport's 
three other majors -- the U.S. Open, Wimbledon and the Australian Open. "I feel 
like when I play guys on clay, they've got a pretty good chance. They're not 
really intimidated by me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel like I'm a bit behind the Couriers and Brugueras on the clay, 
and that's maybe going to take some more time. I realize I need to get a great 
draw and be playing the best tennis of my career because it's going to be the 
biggest challenge for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, 22, doubts that anyone can win all four majors in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as realistically winning the Grand Slam, I think it's -- I don't want 
to say impossible, but it's going to be a hell of an effort," he said. "When 
(Rod) Laver won it (in 1969), he won three of the Slams on grass, which is 
probably his best surface. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically, the French is going to be the biggest hurdle for me. But to 
win all four in the same year is pretty much impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is that all? Said Thomas Muster, when asked what he would have to do to become 
competitive with Sampras after his fifth consecutive lopsided loss against the 
world's No. 1 player: "Be born again, be taller and get long arms."

have 24 homers in 15 games. . . . Mike Greenwell had four hits, including two 
solo homers, drove in four runs and scored four to lead the Boston Red Sox past 
the Texas Rangers, 10-4, at Port Charlotte, Fla. . . . Jose Oquendo had a grand 
slam and Mark Whiten added a two-run homer in a seven-run eighth inning as the 
St. Louis Cardinals beat the Chicago White Sox, 10-8, at Sarasota, Fla. . . . 
The Baltimore Orioles hit six home runs, including five in the first four 
innings, and defeated the Cleveland Indians, 20-8, in a split-squad game at 
Winter Haven, Fla.

NBA ROUNDUP; MOURNING'S DEFENSE HELPS CHARLOTTE WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Alonzo Mourning blocked Karl Malone's three-point shot with 1.9 seconds 
to play, Charlotte clinched a victory in the kind of game it had been losing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets held a three-point lead over the Utah Jazz and Malone was getting 
frustrated. He let fly, saw it blocked and took the blame for an 82-78 defeat 
Friday at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not one for excuses," Malone said. "Alonzo had a good block at the end of 
the game. I took the three-pointer because none of our shooters were open at 
the time. I'll take the heat for tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Curry's free throw finished the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Hornets' fifth victory in the six games since Mourning has returned 
from a calf injury, and it came even though Charlotte scored only eight points 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always known the importance of defense, and that's what won it for us 
tonight," Mourning said. "We have stepped up our intensity and defense and it 
has showed with the success we have had in the last few games. We are a very 
talented team on the defensive end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets still didn't gain ground on New Jersey -- which beat the Lakers -- 
and remain 4 1/2 games behind the Nets in the race for the East's final playoff 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 81, Indiana 78 -- Danny Manning grabbed a loose ball for a breakaway 
dunk with 2.9 seconds to play at Indianapolis, sealing the Hawks' victory and 
denying the Pacers a club-record 12th consecutive home victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 113, Cleveland 96 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 38 points and had 15 
rebounds at Orlando, where the Magic solidified their hold on the fourth 
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference and homecourt advantage in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 100, Philadelphia 98 -- Isaiah Rider made two free throws with 21 
seconds to play and Stacey King added a season-high 20 points to lead the 
Timberwolves, who snapped a 14-game road losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 114, Phoenix 113 -- Joe Dumars scored a team-high 30 points and gave 
the Pistons their only lead on an 18-foot jump shot with 3.6 seconds to play at 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 87, Seattle 84 -- Scottie Pippen scored 22 points and the Bulls 
withstood a fourth-quarter rally at home to win their fourth in a row and fifth 
in their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle last won at Chicago Stadium in November of 1983, 10 games ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 115, Denver 103 -- Mitch Richmond scored 29 points and the Kings 
outscored the Nuggets, 25-8, in the first 8:17 at Denver in winning their 
second in a row and only their seventh victory on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets had won six in a row at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 122, Washington 104 -- Rod Strickland scored a season-high 28 points, 
16 in the second half, and Clyde Drexler added 28 points to lead the Trail 
Blazers at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended the Trail Blazers' four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gugliotta scored a season-high 32 points, 14 in the second quarter, and 
Rex Chapman had 24 points for the Bullets.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; ASTACIO SAYS HE IS OK AFTER FIRST START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pedro Astacio pitched in a game Friday for the first time this spring and 
later said he will be ready when the season starts in 18 days. In his two 
innings against the Philadelphia Phillies, Astacio gave up one hit -- a home 
run to Tom Marsh -- and struck out two in the Dodgers' 7-5 victory at 
Clearwater, Fla. He will pitch three more times before the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be pitching fine," Astacio said. "I threw five times in winter ball, 
so I am OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio, who came on strong near the end of last season, has been sidelined 
since early this spring because of a heart murmur. Tests since indicated all 
was well, but one test resulted in a sore groin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, would neither confirm nor deny a 
report that the club is interested in Florida Marlin left-handed reliever Rich 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no secret that we need a left-hander, but I can tell you that there are 
no major trade talks taking place," Claire said. "I'm happy with what is going 
on with the left-handers in camp. Gary Wayne has taken the lead -- he hasn't 
given up a run in nine innings and six appearances and has seven strikeouts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez started Friday's game and had his best outing this spring. He 
gave up one earned run and three hits in five innings, with four strikeouts and 
three walks. . . . Jim Gott had another shaky outing, giving up two runs and 
hitting a batter in the eighth inning. Pitching Coach Ron Perranoski says Gott 
is working on his timing and there is nothing wrong with his arm. "I got out of 
the inning, that was my concern," Gott said. "I am not concerned with this and 
if anybody else is, then let them be. I'm just getting my rhythm down. This is 
what spring training is for." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza hit his sixth home run of the spring, which leads the National 
League. . . . Eric Karros' batting average is .240, but he drove in two more 
runs Friday to lead the team and to rank second in the league with 13 runs 
batted in. Karros has four homers. . . . Tim Wallach, who is batting .308, 
tripled and scored a run. . . . As part of a dare, double-dare game, Carlos 
Hernandez and Raul Mondesi shaved their heads. "I couldn't believe he would 
actually do it,' Hernandez said. What Mondesi didn't tell Hernandez is that he 
shaved his head two years ago. "If he would have known that, he would not have 
dared me," Mondesi said. Hernandez homered in the game and threw out a 
baserunner. "I think the shaved head gives me more power," he joked. MARYANN

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; MEMORIES OF ERIC SHOW SADDEN LEFFERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel reliever Craig Lefferts stepped on the mound at Phoenix Municipal 
Stadium, looked down, and immediately recalled the memories. 
</P>
<P>
 This was where his buddy, Eric Show, last pitched for the Oakland Athletics in 
the spring of 1992, and few ever heard from him again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to call him, and left a lot of messages," said Lefferts, Show's 
teammate of five years with the San Diego Padres. "I kept in touch with him 
through a mutual friend. I knew he had problems, but I wanted to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I don't get that chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Show was found dead Wednesday in a drug rehabilitation center in San Diego 
County. He had been in and out of drug treatment centers the last two years and 
was discharged from the Betty Ford Clinic last August. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great man, a talented man," Lefferts said, "it just goes to show you 
how powerful drugs can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts, 36, was not using his emotional distress Friday as an excuse for his 
dismal performance in the B game against Oakland, but it appears almost a 
certainty that he will be released. He gave up two homers and four hits in his 
two-inning stint, and has a 16.20 earned-run average. Opposing hitters are 
batting .483 in his four appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The only temptation to keep Lefferts is that he signed a guaranteed $400,000 
contract. But General Manager Bill Bavasi said his contract will have little 
bearing in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't eat a lot of $400,000 contracts," Bavasi said, "but we could eat 
one. If (Manager) Buck (Rodgers) has seen enough, we'll replace him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rodgers: "In this game, batters usually tell you what a pitcher's got. 
And, wow, he sure wasn't missing too many bats today. His fastball just isn't 
there. It's batting-practice variety." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts, who probably will pitch on Sunday, is expected to be replaced by 
left-hander Lee Guetterman. Guetterman, who is 1-1 with a 6.00 ERA, signed a 
minor league contract that will pay him $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who lost to the Athletics, 10-1, in the A game, might also soon be 
faced with a financial decision on utility infielder Spike Owen. Although the 
Angels would prefer to keep Rod Correia and Mike Brumley as their two utility 
infielders, Owen is guaranteed $500,000 in 1994 and $500,000 in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are committed to keeping Correia, who is the second-best shortstop 
on the team, and are impressed by Brumley's speed and versatility. They are 
actively trying to trade utility infielder Torey Lovullo and Owen, but have yet 
to receive any offers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels aren't saying anything publicly, but are mildly suspicious that New 
York Met starter Anthony Young might have been scratched because of tenderness 
in his arm Thursday and not a strained groin. Now, more than ever, they want to 
be completely sure that Young is fully recovered from his elbow surgery in 
September. David Altchek, who performed the surgery, said Young has not 
experienced any discomfort in his elbow this spring. Young is tentatively 
scheduled to pitch Tuesday against the Houston Astros. . . . Met scout Harry 
Minor was on hand in the morning B game to watch J.T. Snow, who was used as the 
designated hitter for the first 5 1/2 innings. Preparing themselves for Snow's 
possible departure, the Angels once again played Eduardo Perez at first base. . 
. . The Angels are expected to release reliever Shawn Hillegas, who is 0-1 with 
a 16.43 ERA. BOB NIGHTENGALE

SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE; THIS RUMOR DIDN'T QUITE MAKE THE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Was Alberto Tomba dead? The butcher in Cortina, Italy, thought so. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that is what he thought he had heard on CNN International at 4 p.m. 
last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The butcher was in his shop, doing what butchers do, when he heard something 
about Tomba in English on the American cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The butcher didn't understand much English, but he heard what he heard. 
</P>
<P>
 His instincts weren't totally illogical. Tomba, the Italian playboy-slalom 
skier, had last been reported in the Napa Valley of California on a 
wine-tasting tour. He had planned to drive to Vail for this week's World Cup 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba likes wine. Tomba drives fast. A car wreck. Yeah, that had to be it. 
</P>
<P>
 The butcher called RAI, the Italian state television network, and asked if the 
agency had heard the news. The network called Resto Del Carlino, Tomba's 
hometown paper in Bologna. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the rumor shifted into high gear on the information superhighway as 
panicked Italian journalists scurried for news about the possible death of the 
country's most famous sports star. 
</P>
<P>
 James Dean, Italian style? 
</P>
<P>
 The Times received several international phone calls of inquiry last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But no, it wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba is alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba learned of the rumors last Saturday when he called his girlfriend in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was (mad) like hell," said Antonio Volpe Pasini, a reporter for 
Tuttosport, one of three all-sports daily Italian newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the rumor was squelched before it made headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We downplayed it a lot," Pasini said. "It was never on TV. Or on radio. Our 
readers didn't know. It was more just a day of hell in the newspaper business." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, winner of five Olympic medals, arrived here earlier this week, rested 
and prepared for today's giant slalom race and Sunday's slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, he's laughing about it," Pasini said of Tomba rumors. "But his father 
(Franco) is still mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba ignored reporters' questions about the death rumors Thursday night at a 
sponsor's pasta party, where he was paid $125,000 to sign autographs and toss 
spaghetti at Italian photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral? 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to journalism, some butchers are mere hacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Tomba: There is a possibility that this weekend's races will be Tomba's 
last in North America. At a news conference Friday, the three-time Olympic gold 
medalist criticized next year's World Cup schedule and said it might force him 
to skip a giant slalom next February at Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, 27, has dropped hints that he will retire after the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Though always subject to change, the World Cup schedule calls for only one 
technical race to be held in North America next year. Tomba does not ski 
downhill or super-giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I make that long trip for just one race?" Tomba said. "I did that 
a couple of years ago when I went to Japan for one race, and I don't want to 
make that kind of mistake again." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, all eyes will be on Tomba this weekend. He isn't having a great season 
in GS, ranking ninth, but has a strong hold on the slalom title with an 
88-point lead over Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, the Olympic slalom champion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Give Tommy Moe credit for not taking the first oil-and-lube commercial that 
came along after his gold-medal victory at Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 The temptation to immediately cash in on his Olympic success must have been 
great, but the 24-year-old Moe has put all endorsement offers on hold until 
after the ski season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, I'll pick and choose," Moe said. "I'm not going on the rubber-chicken 
tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Moe's patience has allowed him to score four consecutive top-six finishes in 
World Cup races, including his first circuit victory at Whistler in British 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the month after Lillehammer, Moe has only enhanced his worldwide skiing 
reputation and market value. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe has assembled a Denver-based management team, Moe Mentum, Inc., to sort 
through the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been inundated with calls from everybody," said Shane Johnson, Moe's 
manager. "There's probably no one that's not been in touch with Tommy. But 
we're taking a slow, methodical approach."

MATADORS PLAY HARDBALL IN SOFTBALL SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mercy, mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 That sums up Cal State Northridge's sweep of Southern Utah in a Western 
Athletic Conference softball doubleheader Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-ranked Matadors pounded 33 hits in nine offensive innings against 
Southern Utah for 10-0 and 19-0 victories. Both games were called after five 
innings because of a 10-run mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know you kind of hate to win like that," said Northridge Coach Gary 
Torgeson, who watched the Matadors capitalize on 11 errors. "I felt really 
sorry for them." 
</P>
<P>
 While Torgeson was feeling sorry for the Thunderbirds, the Matadors (16-2, 2-0 
in WAC play) were securing the 600th victory for Torgeson, who is in his 13th 
season at Northridge. Torgeson's Matador teams are 600-208-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing, isn't it?" Torgeson asked. "It's hard for me to believe we've 
won all those games. I know we've won a bunch, but it still seems like a lot to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-hander Amy Windmiller made No. 600 most memorable by pitching her 
second consecutive no-hitter. Windmiller, who allowed only one baserunner in 
five innings in the second game, no-hit Missouri on March 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller (7-1), who didn't know she had thrown a no-hitter until it was 
announced over the public address system after the game, lowered her earned-run 
average to 0.24. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as long as we win, I don't care (about no-hitters)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller, who struck out 12 of 16 batters, had a tough act to follow. Junior 
right-hander Kathy Blake (6-1) tossed a one-hitter in the first game, 
surrendering a bloop single to Danielle Sandberg leading off the fifth. Blake 
has not given up an earned run in 42 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge batters, it was day to improve their statistics. The Matadors 
collected a school record 21 hits in the second game. Northridge's first six 
batters improved their batting averages. Shannon Jones went five for six with 
four runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who hit a three-run home run in the second game, improved her average 
from .425 to .478. Jennifer Parker, a part-time starter who did not play in the 
first game, went four for four in the second game and raised her average to a 
team-high .600. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, Tamara Ivie's two-run double keyed a three-run first 
inning. Northridge extended the lead to 5-0 in the fourth when Ivie's single to 
center field drove in Jen Fleming and Beth Calcante. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 2 got truly ugly for Southern Utah (4-12, 0-2) in the third inning when 
Northridge scored nine runs on eight hits and four errors to take a 13-0 lead. 
An inning later, the Matadors added six runs on six hits.

BURROUGHS COACH SEEKS ACCEPTANCE AFTER WINNING JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert dos Remedios is 27. He has no previous head coaching experience, and 
Friday he spent his first day as the new Burroughs High football coach using a 
baseball metaphor to describe his situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it doesn't mean I have a strike against me," Dos Remedios said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's young. He's enthusiastic. He's confident. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was also the underdog in a five-man derby to replace Gary Bernardi as 
Burroughs coach, until he was recommended by Principal Tim Buchanan and 
approved by a 5-0 vote of the Burbank Unified School District trustees 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Remedios was chosen over St. Genevieve Coach Richard Fong, former San 
Fernando High Coach Tom Hernandez, Burbank assistant Tom Vessela and Burroughs 
assistant Pat Blackburn. Blackburn was recommended by Bernardi, who is now an 
assistant at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Remedios was Buchanan's choice, but he wasn't the people's choice. A 
13-member search committee had voted, 7-6, for Blackburn over Dos Remedios, an 
assistant at Glendale College the past five seasons. Many Burroughs players 
also backed Blackburn, saying they had established a bond with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fighting that now," said Dos Remedios, who played at rival Burbank High. 
"I'm going to be fighting it for a while. It'll be an uphill battle. It's 
almost like Pat Blackburn got fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can totally understand where the players were coming from. When I was a 
junior at Burbank, my coach, Marty Garrison, was fired. We had that bond, and 
we were unhappy about it. But (Burroughs players) don't know what lies ahead. 
They don't know me and what I'm capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Remedios will retain two assistants -- Keith Knoop and Todd Dellutri -- 
from Bernardi's staff, which turned around Burroughs' record from 0-10 in 1992 
to 5-6 and a playoff berth in 1993. And 12 years after his former coach was 
fired, Dos Remedios has offered Garrison a post as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first thing is get these kids to believe in me and my staff," he said. 
"Nobody loves to win more than me. And we're not going to cut any corners."

 What is silver and goes whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Marco Contreras, the answer on Friday was seven Cal State 
Sacramento bats in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento scored five times in the eighth on seven hits in a row to defeat 
Northridge, 10-6, in a Western Athletic Conference game at Hornet Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was gone before Contreras knew what hit him, and so was a five-game 
winning streak for Northridge (14-11, 3-1 in WAC play). 
</P>
<P>
 The senior right-hander had given up two earned runs and six hits entering the 
inning when everything caved in. Quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kinda tough," Contreras said quietly. "I pitched seven quality innings, 
then gave up (those hits). I know I'm better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 With one out, Jason Beeman singled and Josh Kirtlan homered to left, giving 
Sacramento a 7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The next five Sacramento batters singled and three more runs scored to extend 
the lead to four. Nine batters went to the plate and they liked what they saw. 
Contreras (3-4) threw only 17 pitches in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain it," Contreras said. "I don't know why it happened. It 
(ticks) me off." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Kernen knew why the Matadors lost and it had little to do with 
Contreras' eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge committed four errors, leading to three unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors left the bases loaded in the seventh and runners at second and 
third in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen swore he could see the defeat coming from miles away, even though his 
team held the lead on three occasions and came back from a 3-1 deficit. When 
the chips were down, Northridge failed to execute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have gone to Vegas on this one," Kernen said. "I'd have bet money that 
this game wouldn't work out. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We should have been up, 7-1. It was a gift. We did it all ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento (12-10, 2-2) turned a pair of errors by shortstop Chad Thornhill 
into a 3-1 lead through four innings, but the Matadors began playing long ball 
with left-hander Mike Eby, a graduate of Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Jason Shanahan clubbed a three-run homer in the fifth to give 
Northridge a short-lived 4-3 lead. Jonathan Campbell slammed a solo homer in 
the sixth, his first, for a 5-4 lead that lasted all of two pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Beeman opened the home half of the sixth with a homer to tie the score, 5-5. 
Northridge finally chased Eby -- who gave up six earned runs in as many innings 
-- with a run in the seventh to take a 6-5 lead, but the bats were silenced 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Thobe, a 6-foot-6 right hander who started the game as the designated 
hitter, pitched three innings of one-hit relief, though it wasn't exactly 
uneventful. With a run across, the bases loaded and one out in the seventh, 
Thobe (1-1) retired Tyler Nelson on a pop fly. Joey Arnold, who homered 
earlier, lined out to first and Northridge settled for a 6-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, with runners at second and third, Thobe struck out cleanup 
hitter Kevin Howard for the third out. Howard, who hit for the cycle and drove 
in eight runs Wednesday, struck out four times with three runners at third 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had several opportunities to deliver the knockout punch," said Shanahan, 
who had three hits and drove in four runs. "It definitely came back to bite 
us."

CRESCENTA VALLEY'S LEE MAKES FAST WORK OF PASADENA, 6-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After he pitched Crescenta Valley High to a 6-2 victory over host Pasadena in 
a Pacific League opener Friday, Garrett Lee wanted one thing on the record: 
</P>
<P>
 "My defense was superb today. Make sure that gets in." 
</P>
<P>
 That out of the way, understand that Lee's pitching was the primary reason the 
Falcons won. 
</P>
<P>
 And pitching will be the reason for most of Crescenta Valley's victories. Lee 
is half of a starting tandem that includes Jim Parque, a UCLA-bound 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, we have the two best pitchers in the Pacific League," catcher 
John French said. "(Lee) was blowing the ball by people today." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a right-hander, scattered four hits, struck out seven and walked one. His 
performance was nothing new for the Falcons, though. In four games, Crescenta 
Valley (3-1) has given up four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about our team is the pitching," Coach Tony Zarrillo said. "At 
our level, 75% to 80% of the game is pitching. Two kids can carry a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee (1-1) struggled slightly with control of his curve, but it hardly mattered 
because the Pasadena hitters couldn't catch up to his fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have our best day," Bulldog leadoff hitter Steve Durham said, "and 
maybe (Lee) had one of his best ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee received his primary offensive support in the fifth inning. Leading, 1-0, 
the Falcons started the inning with a triple by Brian Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Jesse Mitchell, who was two for two, drove in Peterson with a 
double. Mitchell scored on a double by Kirk Hagge, who was two for four with 
two runs batted in. Hagge scored on a double by Marty Lane, boosting the lead 
to 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bulldogs (2-5) closed within 4-2, scoring on a fielder's choice in 
the fifth and Ron Koen's home run in the sixth, they fell apart on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena made four errors in the seventh, contributing to Crescenta Valley's 
final two runs. After appearing shaky in the fifth and sixth innings, Lee 
retired the side in order in the seventh. He finished with a strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased to see that when he had a few tough spots, he battled through," 
Zarrillo said. "If he continues to rise to the occasion, we are going to have 
two very good pitchers."

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; HUGHES CATCHES MAJOR SCARE BEFORE BEING ASSIGNED 
TO MINORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Happy birthday, Bobby Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, a catcher in the Milwaukee Brewer organization, celebrated his 23rd 
birthday last Thursday with one of the most frightening experiences of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 He nearly died. 
</P>
<P>
 After catching all nine innings in an exhibition game against the Seattle 
Mariners that day, Hughes passed out in his hotel room because of heat 
exhaustion. His temperature rose to 103 degrees and he was paralyzed for about 
30 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, a graduate of Notre Dame High, figured that if his roommate, Jeff 
Cirillo, had not been in the room when he passed out, he wouldn't have gotten 
help for hours, and he might have died. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really scary," Hughes said. "You think you are getting enough fluids 
during the day, and when it ends up that you haven't, you don't realize it 
until something severe like that happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said he felt fine throughout the game, but was a little sore afterward, 
so he got into a Jacuzzi. When he returned to his hotel room, he felt steadily 
weaker, so he canceled plans to go out and celebrate his birthday with 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 When he tried to leave his bed and head for the bathroom, he passed out before 
he got there. He said he was unconscious for about five minutes and paralyzed 
for about 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to, I had no idea how I ended up in the spot that I was," Hughes 
said. "I was in a weird position in the corner. I was lucky I didn't hit my 
head on anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Cirillo called for the team trainer, who called for paramedics. At first, 
paramedics feared Hughes might have suffered an aneurysm in his brain. Hughes 
was taken to the hospital, where he underwent a CAT scan, which proved 
negative. His condition was diagnosed as severe heat stroke, caused by a lack 
of fluids and worsened by his using the Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
 He was released from the hospital at about 1 a.m. and spent the next day in 
bed, still feeling uneasy, but slowly recuperating. "Everything was still in 
slow motion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday, he was back on the field, playing third base for the final three 
innings of the Brewers' exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes was suffering no further effects of the heat stroke Tuesday. That was 
the good news. The bad news: He was sent down to the minor league camp that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Better Brewer: Hughes' roommate, Cirillo, was faring much better on the field. 
A Providence High graduate, Cirillo played almost every day for the first two 
weeks of exhibition games, replacing injured Kevin Seitzer at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Seitzer has since returned from an injury, so Cirillo likely will soon return 
to minor league camp. "It's exciting," Cirillo said. "The novelty has sort of 
worn off as far as being in a big-league camp. Inevitably, I think I'm going to 
be sent down pretty soon. I'm just going to try to work to get back." 
</P>
<P>
 He made an impression while he was up, though, batting .353 through his first 
12 games. Cirillo, 24, batted .293 in 58 games at triple-A New Orleans and .341 
in 67 games at double-A El Paso last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soaring with the Angels: Left-hander Andrew Lorraine is another area player 
who stuck around in the major league camp through the first round of cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real happy with the way things have turned out," said Lorraine, a Hart 
High graduate. "I guess my expectations of myself have been rising every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine was selected from Stanford in the fourth round of the draft last 
summer, and he finished the season pitching in Class-A Boise (Ida.), where he 
was 4-1 with a 1.29 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was invited to the Angels' major league camp and has been impressive. 
He started an exhibition game against the Colorado Rockies last Saturday, 
giving up three runs in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel like it was a bad outing, though," Lorraine said. "I wasn't 
intimidated by anything. I didn't feel out of my league by any means." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still there: Matt Franco, a first base prospect in the Chicago Cub system, 
remained in the major league camp as of Friday. Franco, from Westlake High, had 
seven hits in 28 at-bats, including a homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco, 24, batted .316 with seven home runs in 68 games at double-A Orlando 
last season. He was named the ninth-best Cub prospect by Baseball America 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco's problem is Mark Grace, who is 29 and has been a fixture at first base 
for the Cubs since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short hops: Seattle Mariner right-hander Roger Salkeld, 23, picked up his 
first spring training victory Wednesday against the Cubs, even though he gave 
up eight hits and four runs in three innings. Salkeld, a 1989 first-round pick 
from Saugus High, is expected to begin the season as the fifth starter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Clayton was optioned to double-A Jacksonville on Monday. A former Cal 
State Northridge player, Clayton, 23, pitched in two exhibition games against 
Seattle, giving up one run in three innings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Infielder Dmitri Young, 20, was sent down to the St. Louis Cardinals' minor 
league camp Sunday. Young was a first-round pick from Rio Mesa High in 1991. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Zaun, 22, a catcher from St. Francis High, was optioned to the Baltimore 
Orioles' triple-A team in Rochester on Wednesday. Zaun was two for two with the 
major league club. Chris Hoiles is the Baltimore starter and Jeff Tackett of 
Camarillo High and veteran Rich Gedman are battling for the backup role.

LOBLOLLY PARTNERSHIP TO END, ANTHONY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thoroughbred farm that produced the last two Preakness winners will phase 
out its operation, beginning by disposing of much of its stock at Keeneland's 
Summer and Fall Sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Loblolly co-owner John Ed Anthony said Friday that the dispersal is intended 
to dissolve the partnership with his former wife, Mary Lynn Dudley, and he 
plans to remain in racing and breeding and remain active at sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Loblolly, based at Lake Hamilton, Ark., will wind down its operations in the 
normal course of racing in the next few years under the direction of trainer 
Tom Bohannan. 
</P>
<P>
 On the auction block at Keeneland will be 21 yearlings, plus all mares who are 
in foal and under 15 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loblolly 2-year-old crop of 1994 will join the older horses in training to 
constitute a racing stable of about 40 head.

SANTA ANITA; VALIANT NATURE, BROCCO ARE SET FOR A REMATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brocco and Valiant Nature will get together again in the $210,000 San Felipe 
Stakes on Sunday, and their second meeting is getting a lot more attention than 
their first. 
</P>
<P>
 Last time, Brocco was all but conceded the Hollywood Futurity after his 
five-length victory in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Valiant Nature had only a 
maiden victory on turf to his credit and was sent off as the second-longest 
shot in the field at 16-1. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Futurity was over, Valiant Nature had beaten Brocco by three-quarters 
of a length in 1:40 3/5 and had everyone eager for a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, the rematch is at hand. California's top two Kentucky 
Derby hopefuls were among six entered Friday morning in the San Felipe, which, 
at 1 1/16 miles, is the same distance as the Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Both colts appear ready for the race, the final local prep for the Santa Anita 
Derby on April 9. Brocco, who has won three of four starts, worked three 
furlongs in 36 4/5 Friday morning. Valiant Nature, who has won two of three, 
went half a mile in 46 1/5, the fastest of 41 workouts at that distance Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's coming up to the race super," said Brocco's trainer, Randy 
Winick. "In my mind, his last three works have been sensational. He's finished 
well and he's been eating well and put weight back on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is whether he's dead fit or not. If he didn't win first time 
back, it wouldn't be the end of the world. But I think he's going to run well." 
</P>
<P>
 Regular rider Gary Stevens agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing as well as he was before the Breeders' Cup and better than he was 
before the Futurity," he said. "He's been training aggressively and he's on top 
of his game right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may be a tad short (Sunday), but going into a race his adrenaline level 
pumps up so much he's going to go out there and run his race. Every one of his 
works has been a step forward and (the San Felipe) will help tighten the screws 
(for the Santa Anita Derby)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek, who had a below-par workout Thursday morning, wasn't entered in 
the San Felipe, but Numerous, his stablemate in the Charlie Whittingham barn, 
was. Numerous is the 1-5 favorite in an allowance race today and it appears he 
will run in that spot unless it rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, Gracious Ghost and Pollock's Luck were the others entered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly Perfect, who lost a shoe when making her first start in nearly three 
months in the Buena Vista Handicap last month, is the 3-1 morning-line favorite 
in the $158,500 Santa Ana Handicap today at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-1 upset winner of the Yellow Ribbon on Nov. 14, Possibly Perfect 
finished fourth as the 13-10 choice in the Buena Vista and the three mares who 
were in front of her that day will be back in the Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly Perfect, a 4-year-old Northern Baby filly, was beaten by two lengths 
in the Buena Vista. Kent Desormeaux will ride again for trainer Bobby Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hero's Love, third in the Buena Vista, is the 7-2 second choice and will be 
helped by the extra distance. At 1 1/8 miles, the Santa Ana is an eighth of a 
mile longer than the Buena Vista and Hero's Love won the San Gorgonio at 1 1/8 
miles earlier in the meeting. Laffit Pincay will ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Lady Blessington and Skimble, who finished a nose apart on Feb. 27, are both 
4-1. Skimble, also trained by Frankel, has been second in six of her last 10 
starts and Lady Blessington will be reunited with Corey Black, who is unbeaten 
in two tries with the 6-year-old mare. 
</P>
<P>
 The other entrants in the Grade I race are Miami Sands, Kalita Melody, second 
to Paseana in the Santa Margarita on the main track, and Waitryst, who has 
three consecutive victories against allowance rivals for trainer Frank 
Olivares.

INSPECTOR WRESTLES WITH ALLIGATORWEED; AGRICULTURE: HIS JOB IS TO DESTROY ALL 
TRACES OF THE VINELIKE PREDATOR. IT COULD DAM UP L.A.'S FLOOD-CONTROL SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alligatorweed may not bite, but it's got a hell of a stranglehold on Jim 
Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman's sole mission as a county agricultural inspector is to kill every 
last shred of the South American pest, a vinelike predator that left unchecked 
forms huge mats that could dam up Los Angeles' entire flood-control system and 
annihilate every native species in its path. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly as tenacious as the infamous Medfly or the South's kudzu vine, 
alligatorweed keeps springing up in Los Angeles County despite a 26-year, 
$2-million effort by various government agencies to stamp it out. At the height 
of the infestation in the early 1970s, nearly a dozen workers took to boats, 
bicycles and all-terrain vehicles in search of the prolific weed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's Hartman, 33, who has the unenviable task of ferreting out the last 
few interlopers from among the other hollow-stemmed plants that resemble it. 
Four days a week, 10 hours a day, rain or shine, for an annual salary of about 
$40,000, Hartman dons hip waders and trudges through rivers and streams in the 
San Gabriel Valley to look for his nemesis. A state employee aids him in his 
quest three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hartman spots the perennial, he must dig down at least 5 feet to uproot 
it, hack it to pieces with a shovel and toss the waste into a thick black 
plastic bag. But the resilient weed easily absorbs that much punishment and 
more without giving up. Left alone, the mats formed by the weed are as thick as 
they are strong, capable of withstanding the weight of a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 To kill it, Hartman has to take every last scrap to a landfill and bury it 
under 3 inches of concrete, or 6 feet of dirt, to prevent the broken stems from 
regenerating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen it after it's been in a plastic bag for almost a year and it was 
still sending up shoots," Hartman said with a shudder. "Just a little moisture 
is all it takes."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the plant's resiliency, county officials are optimistic they are 
gaining the upper hand. They estimate that it now covers only about a seventh 
of an acre total, down from 125 acres in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem is that it remains spread out over about nine square miles in 
the San Gabriel Valley, not conveniently bunched in one spot. So far this 
fiscal year, Hartman has found 10 times as much as his predecessor did the year 
before, largely because the plant thrived in last season's wet weather, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we think we have it licked, we find one more spot," said Richard 
Whiteman, Hartman's boss.  
</P>
<P>
 But he and state officials say it would be foolhardy to give up now that they 
may be close to eradicating the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made an awful lot of headway and it's not been easy or cheap," Whiteman 
said. "If we let up at this point, we'll be right back to where we were. It'd 
be a shame to waste all those hours of work." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of how alligatorweed got a grip on the county -- and Hartman -- 
starts in the 1870s in the Alabama port city of Mobile, where it was first 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Native to South America, the plant may have hitched a ride to the United 
States by clinging to rocks that were used as ballast and later dumped over the 
side, said Ted Center, a researcher with the aquatic plant control division of 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Another theory holds that the weed arrived via the mail because it was 
commonly used as packing material in the 19th Century before Styrofoam was 
invented, said Al Cofrancesco, a research etymologist with the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials blame the Corps of Engineers, which they say 
inadvertently imported it when it stuck to the underside of heavy machinery 
that was used in South America and then brought to the San Gabriel Valley to 
build the Whittier Narrows Dam. Naturally, the corps regards that theory as 
improbable, Cofrancesco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another version has a nursery importing the stuff for use as an 
ornamental. Imagine the surprise on the face of the hapless homeowner who woke 
up one day to find the fast-growing plant with innocent white flowers in the 
spring had taken over his lawn, said Nathan Dechoretz, supervisor of the 
state's weed and vertebrate control and eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble is that probably all the stories may be somewhat true," Center 
said. "All I can give you is the most widely accepted guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how it landed, Alternanthera philoxeroides was soon dubbed 
alligatorweed by biologists who believed that the reptiles helped spread the 
infestation in Florida by dragging stems from place to place in search of wet 
areas during the dry season, Hartman said. The plant was first observed in Los 
Angeles County in 1956 by a county employee who noted that it was sending 
awfully deep taproots into the bottom of the Rio Hondo River in El Monte, said 
Doug Barbe, a taxonomist with the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture, which keeps records on such things. It was later found in Tulare, 
Kings and San Diego counties, but has been virtually eradicated there, state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed at the proliferation of the weed in the Southeast, the USDA and the 
corps in 1959 opened a research lab in Argentina with the intention of breeding 
the plant's natural insect predators and exporting them to the United States, 
Cofrancesco said. Three bugs were bred, and two -- the alligatorweed flea 
beetle and the stem borer -- had succeeded by the early 1970s in making a huge 
dent in the Southeast's problem. The plant is now considered under control, 
though not totally eradicated there, Center said. (The plant is said to be 
eradicated if it fails to reappear in any given spot for three straight years.) 
 
</P>
<P>
 It was a different story in Los Angeles County, where the tropical flea 
beetles failed to survive several winters in the mid- and late 1960s. Center 
faults state and county officials at the time for giving up too easily on the 
insects. The state gave the weed an "A" rating identifying it as a public 
threat, but relied on herbicides and manual removal instead of insects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a common problem in bio-control programs -- people panic and don't 
trust experimental methods like insects," Center said. "So they use other means 
to reduce the number of plants to the point where there's not enough for the 
bugs to survive on. Then they still have to go after the remaining plants, but 
they are progressively harder and harder to find." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's eradication effort was complicated by the fact that developers 
had been permitted to take soil filled with alligatorweed from the Whittier 
Narrows Dam area and use it to grade dozens of housing tracts in Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
 A massive public education campaign and constant visits by government workers 
in the late 1960s and early 1970s succeeded in eradicating the weed from most 
back yards, county officials said. But Hartman said local residents using the 
bike path that parallels the San Gabriel River still occasionally greet him as 
he toils along the banks by saying, "Hey, you must be the alligatorweed man."  
</P>
<P>
 Today, soil from the dam area can be used only under asphalt or concrete, and 
part of Hartman's job is to inspect the undersides of bulldozers and other 
earth-moving equipment to make sure no alligatorweed is inadvertently 
transported elsewhere when the equipment is moved. Hartman likes his job 
because he gets to work outdoors. But he's not particularly fond of the weed, 
an antipathy shared by every official interviewed for this story. They 
described alligatorweed as "noxious," "aggressive," "evasive," "nasty," 
"horrible," "unwanted" and even "feral." 
</P>
<P>
 "The average person thinks a plant is a plant, but it's not," said Dechoretz, 
the state official. "A lot of people don't understand, but there's a term for 
things like alligatorweed -- biological pollutants. They upset the balance of 
nature. They can be worse than most chemical pollutants because they don't 
break down over time. They multiply."  
</P>
<P>
 Hartman doesn't need convincing.  
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose someone could see this as a silly thing to do," he said, "but I 
take my job very seriously. I'm hoping we can get this thing in the next five 
years. But as with any biological agent, we just don't know."

RECORDS OF COLLAPSED APARTMENTS NOW PUBLIC; COURTS: PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOTAPES 
OF THE COMPLEX WHERE 16 PEOPLE DIED ARE OPEN FOR REVIEW AFTER OWNERS DROP THEIR 
REQUEST FOR A GAG ORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The owners of the collapsed Northridge Meadows apartments dropped their 
request for a gag order Friday, leaving photographs and videotapes of the 
crumbling complex and the original building plans open to public review. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was hailed by structural engineers and members of public agencies 
studying seismic safety in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 Northridge quake, the 
most destructive in modern Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to hear this information is in the public domain," said Fred 
Turner, staff structural engineer for the state Seismic Safety Commission. 
"We're all in this together." 
</P>
<P>
 During the brief hearing at which the request was dropped, San Fernando 
Superior Court Judge Judith Meisels Ashmann ordered that the Reseda Boulevard 
complex be preserved as evidence through a controlled demolition. At a cost of 
about $500,000, the building will be taken down piece by piece while 
construction materials are studied and tenants' possessions are retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
 No demolition date has been set, but a hearing before the city's Building and 
Safety Committee is scheduled next week. Attorneys said they expect the city 
will follow the court order. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the families of five of the 16 people who died at Northridge 
Meadows were in the courtroom Friday, and the number of Northridge Meadows 
negligence and wrongful death suits is expected to grow. San Fernando Superior 
Court Judge William A. MacLaughlin is to hear all the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Castro, a Santa Monica lawyer who represents the families of quake 
victims Ann Cerone and Bea Reskin, has hired a team of experts to photograph 
and study the ruins of the complex. They spent three days at the site last week 
but still need to examine the first floor, where the most compelling evidence 
may be found, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Castro asked the court for permission to enter the ruined complex 
to retrieve a tenant's diary, which he said contained a two-year log of 
problems and repeated requests for repairs. The diary is buried in the rubble, 
Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLaughlin agreed to tour the site Wednesday after attorneys for both sides 
told him that viewing it would help him comprehend the complex issues and 
devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 Time pressure and the unique challenges of preserving a rat- and fly-infested 
disaster scene as evidence have spawned a spirit of cooperation among the 
attorneys in the case. They have shared expenses and evidence during the early 
stages of their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But a dispute over how that evidence is used led to Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 E. A. Tharpe III and Robert M. Freedman, attorneys for building owners 
Shashikant and Renuka Jogani, had sought to block public disclosure of evidence 
gathered by experts, claiming that publicity would harm the Joganis' 
reputations and prejudice prospective jurors against them. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Tharpe said, the Joganis decided to withdraw the gag order request "so it 
will be clear we are not trying to hide anything in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit names the Joganis, who purchased the apartments about 10 years 
after they were built; Heller Construction of Westlake Village, which built the 
complex, architect Morris Brown and structural engineer Woodward Tom. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days after the quake, engineers and officials with the city's Building 
and Safety Department said the lack of plywood-reinforced shear walls probably 
played a role in the collapse. Such plywood reinforcements were not required in 
1970, when the building plans were approved. Attorneys for Heller have said the 
company complied with codes when the structure was built in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro has agreed to release his data to any public agency that asks for it; 
Tharpe said the owners also would provide findings of their experts at cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely happy because too often critical data are not available and, 
as a result, the same errors can be repeated time and time again," said 
seismologist James E. Slosson, a member of the state Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Bookbinder, a structural engineer who has pushed to open up expert 
findings used in court cases, took matters a step further. He called for an 
independent engineering study of Northridge Meadows by experts not involved in 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm most anxious to try to walk the site personally," Bookbinder said. "My 
opinion of the whole thing is, it is very important from a professional 
standpoint that the building is allowed to be reviewed and investigated by 
competent structural engineers so we can determine what went wrong and why it 
failed so we can make changes in the codes."

PIERCE COLLEGE HIRES LEE AS ITS PRESIDENT; EDUCATION: SHE WILL SERVE AT LEAST 
TWO YEARS, SUCCEEDING LOWELL ERICKSON, WHO GOES ON LEAVE APRIL 11. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the late 1980s when officials were looking for someone to lead Pierce 
College, Mary Lee, president of Valley College, was named to the search 
committee. But she ended up quitting the panel to take a run at the job 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I drove around Pierce, I decided there is no one who can do what needs to 
be done out there other than me," Lee recalled. College district officials, 
though, had other ideas and picked another administrator for Pierce, leaving 
Lee at Valley College in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Lee's going to get her chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-campus Los Angeles Community College District confirmed Friday that 
the 54-year-old Lee, president of Valley College since 1981, will become 
Pierce's acting president on April 11 for at least a two-year stint. Departing 
president Lowell Erickson plans to take a one-year leave of absence and perhaps 
return to teaching, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the change said Lee, known as a strict and efficient 
administrator who also is an avid horsewoman, has marching orders to try to 
rescue the Woodland Hills campus from a downward spiral of declining 
enrollment, deteriorating facilities and flagging morale. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Friday afternoon with some Pierce College instructors, Lee said 
as much herself. She listed as her top three goals the return of Pierce to its 
former status as the college with the district's highest enrollment, to resolve 
its troubled finances, and to "regain its premier reputation" in the 
surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think Pierce has potential it hasn't lived up to," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth resident was already talking on Friday of changes to boost 
enrollment for the fall semester and planning a series of meetings with campus 
groups for next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sought out Dr. Lee for this new assignment because of her strong leadership 
abilities, her experience, her proven capability in the administration of a 
large college campus and her familiarity with Pierce College," said Neil 
Yoneji, interim chancellor of the Los Angeles district, which started the 
school year with nearly 102,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Although enrollments districtwide have been dropping, the falloff in recent 
years has been particularly severe at Pierce. Enrollment this spring fell to 
14,663 students, down about 13% from a year ago and to its lowest level this 
fall in 25 years. Pierce now is the district's second most populous campus 
behind Valley, which has 15,879 students.

 Lee, a hard-charger who once attended a truck driving school to get a 
commercial license and who has been studying for a law degree, is no stranger 
to Pierce. Her first job with the college district in 1977-78 was as its dean 
of development and acting vice president for academic affairs. She also took 
agriculture classes there. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her biggest challenges will be shaping the future of the agriculture 
department and its 250-acre farm, once the heart of the college but now fallen 
on hard times. "It will never be revived the way it was," Lee said. But she 
talked generally of trying to run programs that that will involve the broader 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Another headache will be a $1-million deficit facing the college because 
administrators there this year relied on getting that amount from the 
developers of the Warner Ridge project in exchange for their placing fill dirt 
on an unused part of the campus. But that deal fell through recently when the 
development project stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee also will have to overcome skepticism by Pierce College faculty and staff, 
who have seen five other presidents before her come and go since the late 
1970s. Complicating the situation will be the fact that she, like most of the 
others, has been placed there by district administrators without any input from 
the campus community. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues said Erickson, 58, who had transferred to Pierce from Mission 
College in mid-1991, initiated the change by asking district officials about a 
leave of absence, particularly after the Jan. 17 earthquake caused more than $2 
million in damage. "It just wasn't working for him," a colleague said, citing 
frustrations over the damage and the college's varied problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A district spokesman said Lee's annual salary will remain $89,934. Erickson's 
salary has been $88,855, and his leave apparently will be on paid status. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee will be replaced at Valley by Tyree Wieder, 46, the college's vice 
president for academic affairs, who also is expected to serve at least two 
years. Wieder earns $73,580, but probably will get a raise.

DESERT BLOOM; PARK'S BRILLIANT POPPIES HERALD THE ARRIVAL OF SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poking up from the parched desert, fighting for sunshine amid thick weeds, the 
season's first bright orange California poppies burst into view Friday at a 
1,700-acre park dedicated to the state flower. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating the arrival of spring by three days, the 18-year-old Antelope Valley 
California Poppy Reserve reopened to flower lovers, hikers and camera buffs. 
Wildflower experts expect a healthy but not spectacular showing of blooms this 
year, blaming it on a shortage of winter rain and a surplus of wild grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, such predictions didn't dampen the enthusiasm of Mary Snyder, 
coordinator of volunteer docents at the park, situated about 15 miles west of 
downtown Lancaster. Snyder said Friday's array of flora was a vast improvement 
over the four lonely blooms she spotted at the park just two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm optimistic," Snyder said. "But I think it's going to be a lot 
better than we had been planning." 
</P>
<P>
 The park, which will be open through May 15, attracts visitors from around the 
world, particularly when the perfect combination of plentiful rain and mild 
spring temperatures turn the grounds into a dazzling blanket of orange. The 
last time that occurred was 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated downpours last winter provoked the furious growth of weeds, which 
deprive the poppies of critical moisture and sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grasses grew so high because of the rain last year, so the poppies and 
wildflowers are going to be competing with it," said Yolande Elliott, a 
spokeswoman for the Theodore Payne Foundation, a wildflower education group. 
"Whichever is the tallest is what you'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 Although visitors to the park will see plenty of poppies this year, "it's not 
going to be a solid field of orange like it was a few years ago," said Vic 
Maris, superintendent of the Mojave Desert State Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The poppy season generally runs about two months. In addition to the poppy 
reserve, the flowers can be seen throughout the Antelope Valley on private 
property and in other parks this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 To give the poppies a hand, the state plans to burn part of the fields in June 
under controlled conditions. When such fires occur naturally, flowers are 
usually the first vegetation to sprout anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Maris said the burn will kick off a long-term search for methods to promote 
the growth of wildflowers. "We'll learn a great deal over the next 10 years 
about what we need to do to manipulate the environment in a natural way to 
enhance our flowering fields," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During poppy season, the park, at 15101 Lancaster Road, will be open seven 
days a week from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The state charges $5 per car for admission. 
</P>
<P>
 The park can be reached by taking the Antelope Valley Freeway north to Avenue 
I in Lancaster. Drive west on Avenue I, which becomes Lancaster Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking flowers at the park or along the roadside is illegal. Park visitors 
are urged to remain on the hiking trails to avoid damaging the plants and to 
steer clear of rattlesnakes. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 16 and 17, the city of Lancaster will offer free shuttle rides from 
Lancaster City Park to the poppy reserve during the annual California Poppy 
Festival, sponsored by the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jewish inmates in the Los Angeles County Jail system will have the opportunity 
to celebrate Passover, the holiday marking the ancient Hebrews' deliverance 
from the Egyptians, during special services at the end of this month, the 
Sheriff's Department announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Martin Ryback will conduct services Friday at the Men's Central Jail for 
inmates housed at Central Jail and Biscaluz Center, at the Sybil Brand 
Institute on March 29 for women inmates, and at the North County Correctional 
Facility for inmates of Pitchess Honor Rancho, also March 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the services, inmates will partake in the traditional Seder meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the items served will be grape juice, gefilte fish, hard-boiled eggs, 
chicken, matzo ball soup and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that a Jewish inmate is in custody will not affect his or her 
ability to observe the ancient Jewish holiday of Passover," Sheriff Sherman 
Block said in a written statement. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ROCK STAR MUST PAY $60,000 IN '92 MELEE

<P>
 Rock star Ozzy Osbourne's insurance company has been ordered to pay $60,000 to 
a Burbank electrician who claims he was trampled during a 1992 concert. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury made the award to Kenneth Allan Winkler, 
43, who claimed that he was injured in the melee that ensued after Osbourne 
invited a heavy metal crowd at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre to climb onto the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler claimed he was trampled in the melee and suffered a shoulder injury 
known as a torn rotator cuff. He filed a civil lawsuit against Osbourne, the 
concert hall and its security firm, seeking $250,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 William I. Goldsmith of Tarzana, said his client deserved a bigger award. 
"This is really disheartening," Goldsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors decided to compensate Winkler for only past medical expenses and lost 
wages, and awarded him $10,000 for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip D. Weiss, the Universal City-based attorney for Osbourne's insurance 
company, said Osbourne's actions were "a really stupid thing to do." But he 
said Winkler's shoulder injury was less serious than the electrician and his 
attorney had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because Ozzy Osbourne is a star, they treated this like the lottery," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 28, 1992, Osbourne was finishing a show at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre when, according to court testimony, the singer told the audience 
he wanted to make it a night to remember and invited them to join his band 
onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 people surged toward the stage after Osbourne's invitation, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler testified that he was trying to leave the concert when he was trampled 
by boisterous fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found that Irvine Meadows was not liable for the mishap, nor was the 
security company working that night. E.J. GONG JR.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: WOMEN'S SHELTER SETS UP SPEAKERS BUREAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In hope that educating the public about family violence will reduce the number 
of women and children battered and abused, a women's shelter has created a 
speakers bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills, the only shelter for battered women and their children in the San 
Fernando Valley, will provide speakers at no cost to any group requesting them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to get at the issue any way we can," said Betty Fisher, 
director of the West Valley shelter. "It's helping people in the community know 
that they're going to run into this problem in the workplace, in the 
neighborhood, in their family. To let them know what they're seeing and what 
can be done about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing about the different facets of abuse can sometimes help a woman 
recognize that she, too, is in an unhealthy relationship, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we run into with women in abusive relationships is that 
they don't self-identify. They define abuse very narrowly," Fisher said. "If 
you end up in the hospital with broken bones it's easy to identify yourself as 
in an abusive relationship. There are a lot more subtle forms." 
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills, a private, nonprofit organization, has operated out of the San 
Fernando Valley since 1977. The center provides shelter, counseling and job 
referrals to the women and children who seek help. The location of the shelter 
is kept a secret to protect the women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the Haven Hills Speakers Bureau or to request a 
speaker, contact the center at (818) 887-7481. REBECCA BRYANT

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; AIRCRAFT SCHOOL DEFIES GRAVITY OF THE RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside a hangar on the west side of Van Nuys Airport, a hundred people are 
betting that the future will take off. 
</P>
<P>
 In defiance of the recession that has pummeled the aviation and aerospace 
industries in Southern California, forcing thousands of aviation mechanics out 
of their jobs, dozens of adult and teen-age students at the North Valley 
Occupational Center Aircraft Mechanics Program are learning how to build and 
fix planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job market is so bad right now with all the people being laid off," said 
student Mehrdad Razavi, 38, holding a square of sheet metal under a magnifying 
glass. "But it's a good career. It's not going to stay down all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, enrollment at the school, which is part of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's adult and occupational education program, is up about 20% in 
the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that when the economy is bad, everyone goes to school," said Jack 
Brestel, an instructor with the aircraft mechanics program for 21 years.  
</P>
<P>
 When the school opened at its present site -- a $1.5-million facility built in 
1978 by the school district -- Brestel had just six students. Placing them in 
jobs was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "(For) any graduate of our school, we could make a phone call and get them a 
job," Brestel said. "Those were the good times." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, instructors encourage graduates to accept any position with the airlines, 
including handling baggage, with the hope of moving up to aviation mechanic 
positions. Several graduates recently accepted jobs at Magic Mountain, 
maintaining and repairing the hydraulic and electronic equipment on the 
amusement park rides until the economy picks up. 
</P>
<P>
 The school started in 1970 as a high school program, and moved to several 
locations before the hangar and classrooms were built in 1978 for the adult 
school. For about $55 a semester for the 2 1/2-year program, students earn a 
license in airframe and power plant mechanics, which prepares them to build and 
repair all types of aircraft.  
</P>
<P>
 About 40% of those in training are high school students, who spend half of 
their day at their regular campus and the other half at the hangar. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, aviation is a second career. 
</P>
<P>
 Val Guzman, 40, worked at the General Motors plant in Panorama City for 18 
years, trouble-shooting engines before he was laid off when the plant closed in 
1992. "I'm not going to sit around and say 'What can I do?,' " Guzman said. "In 
California, if you can only do one thing, you'll get stuck." SUSAN BYRNES

<P>
 A Van Nuys man convicted of drunk driving for the fifth time in nine years was 
sentenced to a year in jail Thursday, according to the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose de Carmen Flores, 33, was also placed on three years probation after 
pleading guilty to driving drunk with prior convictions and driving on a 
suspended license, according to Deputy City Atty.Debra Siedorf, who handled the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores was arrested by Los Angeles police in Van Nuys about 2 a.m. Feb. 13 
after they found him in his car, which was parked with the motor running in an 
eastbound traffic lane of Sherman Way near Van Nuys Boulevard. His 
blood-alcohol level was .13. The legal limit is .08. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; WEATHER BUFFS ASSIST CANYON RAINFALL STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small army of volunteer weather buffs, using back yard rain gauges, are key 
to a new study of erratic rainfall patterns in Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which is being pieced together from readings taken by weather 
enthusiasts scattered across the canyon, will help a citizens committee draft 
regulations for managing development in the delicate Topanga Canyon area, home 
of one of the last natural stream beds feeding Malibu Bay, said Rosi Dagit, a 
consultant for the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagit said she started recruiting volunteers for the project because Los 
Angeles County did not have the money to do its own study, and was instead 
using rough projections of rainfall to identify areas of high flood risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were making assumptions based on no data," said Dagit, a biologist. "So, 
I thought because a lot of people do weather monitoring as a hobby, that we 
could maybe tap into that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dagit began seeking amateur weather enthusiasts who could provide a cheap 
alternative to a full-blown scientific study of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she has located about 30 canyon residents to do the job. They include 
clinical psychologist Gerry Haigh, who has been assiduously keeping rainfall 
data for fun for about a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagit said Haigh's computer records of readings taken not on a monthly, but a 
daily basis, have been a surprise windfall for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Haigh said he uses a simple plastic rain gauge, really just a calibrated cup, 
to measure water after every storm. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why he does it, he pauses, perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure why," he said. "I guess the variation between flood and drought 
here intrigued me . . . You get up in the morning and it's been raining and you 
just want to know how much. Everyone's always curious." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers are nearing the end of their first winter of data-taking. Haigh 
said the year has been an especially dry one; his gauge has registered about 12 
inches of rainfall compared to 40 inches by this same time the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The information collected by data takers will be plugged into computer models 
to project flood patterns in the 20-square-mile Topanga Canyon Watershed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Topanga Canyon Floodplain Management Citizens Advisory Committee will use 
the projections to map areas of high flood risk in the canyon, and to draft 
regulations to protect the safety of residents and preserve the wildlife of the 
creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said the information gleaned from back yard rain gauges is especially 
important because changes in the weather are often highly localized across the 
steep and varied terrain of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference in rainfall between Old Topanga and Fernwood Canyons in a 
single storm can be two to four inches," said Dagit.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee has about two more years to complete its work. Dagit said she is 
still trying to recruit as many citizen researchers as she can to find out more 
about where and when it rains in Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 To volunteer to help with the study, contact the Resource Conservation 
District at (310) 455-1030. JILL LEOVYTOPANGA CANYON.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; PROTEST LINGERS OVER REASSIGNED PRINCIPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Backed by several human rights organizations, supporters of demoted Burbank 
High School Principal Keiko Hentell, who was reassigned to other duties and 
removed from the school two weeks ago, are continuing to protest her demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The . . . consequences we are experiencing as a result of your unilateral 
divisive action has poisoned our relationships and will last for years to come 
unless you reconsider your action," the Rev. John Simmons, a retired Lutheran 
minister and head of the Burbank Human Relations Council, told the school board 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests took the spotlight away from the $100-million school bond measure 
on the April 12 ballot. The school board thanked Walt Disney Studios, the 
Burbank Board of Realtors and the Burbank Chamber of Commerce for their 
donations and support in the campaign to get the measure approved. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members were then forced to defend their action regarding Hentell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard for people to separate these two issues," said Sharon 
Ranshaw, a Burbank High parent who suggested that the bond campaign might be 
affected by the public outcry over Hentell's demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board has refused to discuss why Hentell was removed, but her 
supporters have speculated that the action was taken because of Hentell's 
support of ethnic groups within Burbank High School over her three years as 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons read a letter to the board from the Japanese American Citizens League, 
which condemned the decision to remove Hentell and described the embattled 
ex-principal as "the first Japanese-American principal to serve in the Burbank 
Unified School District . . . a distinguished individual in the Asian American 
Community. 
</P>
<P>
 "At best, the school board can be seen as having a lack of sensitivity to the 
ethnic community concerns and at worst can be accused of prejudice and racism," 
read the letter, signed by Jimmy Tokeshi, the league's Los Angeles regional 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Another letter, signed by eight civil rights organizations, was read by 
Burbank Human Relations Council Vice President Lila Ramirez. That letter asked 
the board to either justify its actions or reinstate Hentell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never a racial issue," School Board President Elena Hubbell said, 
adding that she is angry that the board is being described as a short-sighted, 
all-white body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the members of the school board were elected to do a job and you 
did that job," said Shirley Nelson, a former board member who stood up to 
defend the board. "I don't believe you are racist." ED BOND

 An advisory committee created when the city of Burbank and residents clashed 
last year over traffic and parking problems in Magnolia Park is now tackling a 
somewhat loftier issue: how to improve the neighborhood's image. 
</P>
<P>
 At the prompting of the 14-member Magnolia Park Citizens Advisory Committee -- 
a group of merchants, residents and transportation and traffic experts -- the 
city will mail 2,000 surveys to residents next week to try to gauge what is 
needed to revitalize the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone from a confrontational situation to a cooperative situation," Dr. 
David Gordon, a local optometrist, said of the relationship between the 
neighborhood and the city. Gordon, who last year watched with suspicion as the 
city considered widening some intersections of Hollywood Way, is now chairman 
of the citizens advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans for the street widening angered residents and merchants who worried 
that it would mean losing parking and business. The outrage prompted the city 
to form the committee to study how best to spend $3.4 million in transportation 
funds to improve the traffic flow. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is 
providing half of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Two versions of the surveys will be mailed Wednesday, one for merchants and 
the other for residents who live near the Magnolia Park business district, said 
Greg Herrmann, the city's project planner for the Magnolia Park committee. The 
survey will solicit suggestions on improving the area, ask what businesses are 
needed, and inquire about the effect traffic has on the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to revitalize and improve the Magnolia Park district of 
Burbank," said Gordon, who now applauds the attention the city is giving the 
neighborhood. "We're trying to create a new atmosphere in the community, so 
instead of losing businesses and having business decay, we're trying to put in 
a stimuli, a directed and planned method of improving the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has scheduled two workshops to solicit public comment. They will be 
held April 7 from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., and April 9 from 9 to 11 a.m. at Luther 
Burbank Middle School. ED BOND

2 MEN PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO STALKING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Burbank men pleaded not guilty Friday in Burbank Municipal Court to 
charges of stalking a couple in connection with the shooting of a Los Angeles 
man earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said one of the accused, Robert Young, 27, of Burbank, at one 
point rented a helicopter to follow the victim, who was shot about 4 p.m. 
Wednesday.Police would not release the name of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Marcelo Flores, 26, both of Burbank; John Matthews Jr., 30, of 
Northridge, and Malcolm Alarca, 22, of Sunland, were arrested within hours of 
the shooting. All work for a Burbank towing company, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Flores have been charged with two counts of stalking the victim and 
his girlfriend, both 27. Bail has been set at $500,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews and Alarca were not charged, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Young and Flores had been watching the victim and Young's 
ex-girlfriend for at least three weeks before the shooting. The woman 
apparently had stopped dating Young in order to date the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been threatened by the two men several times, but were unaware 
they were being followed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who was shot several times as he entered his parked car, was in 
fair condition at a local hospital. He is expected to recover, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they have not determined the triggerman's identity.

CONSERVATIVES AND FEMINISTS DIFFER ON FIGURE OF WISDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Happy are those who find wisdom, and those who get understanding, for her 
income is better than silver and her revenue better than gold.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Proverbs 3:13-18 "The Lord created me at the beginning of his work, the 
first of his acts of long ago."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Wisdom, speaking in 
</P>
<P>
 Proverbs 8:22 "Wisdom ( Sophia ) is vindicated by all her children."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Jesus, speaking in Luke 7:35 Biblical conservatives in Presbyterian and 
United Methodist circles have charged that the biblical figure of Wisdom, an 
aspect of God occasionally personified in Proverbs and embodied by Jesus in 
parts of the New Testament, has taken on the image of a goddess for some 
feminists today. But most participants in a controversial conference say it is 
not so. 
</P>
<P>
 In a blessing over milk and honey at the "Re-imagining 1993" women's 
conference last November in Minneapolis, the ritual invoked Sophia, the Greek 
word for wisdom in the New Testament, which was written in Greek. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples quoted by the conservative Methodist magazine Good News: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our maker Sophia, we are women in your image: With the hot blood of our wombs 
we give form to new life. . . . Our mother Sophia, we are women in your image: 
With the milk of our breasts we suckle the children; with the knowledge of our 
hearts we feed humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 James V. Heidinger II, editor of Good News, said the homage to Sophia and 
other conference presentations were "radical departures from historic Christian 
doctrine and teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 A retired Methodist bishop, Earl Hunt, speaking generally of feminist 
attention to Sophia, termed it a heresy that "staggers the religious mind" and 
"must be eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 But one participant, Catherine Keller, who teaches theology at 
Methodist-related Drew University in Madison, N.J., said, "Sophia is a 
metaphor, nothing less and nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feminists who are looking for a goddess are quickly disappointed in Sophia." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jeanne Audrey Powers, a national ecumenical official with the United 
Methodists, said feminist scholars who have "begun to find feminine elements in 
the godhead and who are seeking to remain within the church are sometimes 
condemned as radical for trying to find elements in Scripture and tradition 
that they can relate to as women." JOHN DART

RELIGION / JOHN DART; CRITICISM FOR CONFERENCE LINGERS; PRESBYTERIANS: AT LEAST 
FOUR CONGREGATIONS WILL CALL FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST DENOMINATIONAL LEADERS WHO 
ATTENDED THE NOVEMBER MEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ecumenical women's conference -- whose worship included invoking a feminine 
name for the biblical Wisdom of God and conducting a milk-and-honey ritual -- 
has sent tremors along the ideological fault lines that run through the 
Presbyterian and United Methodist denominations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the controversial conference occurred last November in Minneapolis, 
aftershocks have continued ever since with heated charges of blasphemy and 
heresy by conservative groups. Critics called the meeting a "celebration of 
lesbianism" and objected to graphic descriptions of bodily fluids -- including 
blood and breast milk -- in one ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants claim, in their equally fervent defenses, that Sophia , the 
feminine name in Greek for the Wisdom of God, was not presented as a goddess 
figure, that the milk-and-honey rite was not a mock Communion service and that 
no one participating was obliged to agree with unorthodox theology or 
individual statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another tremor will be felt in the San Fernando Valley on April 5, when at 
least four Presbyterian congregations will submit a resolution for debate by 
the regional church body, the Presbytery of San Fernando, decrying the 
"Re-imagining 1993" ecumenical conference and calling for sanctions against 
denominational leaders who attended. 
</P>
<P>
 The four initial sponsors of the resolution are Glendale Presbyterian, Canoga 
Park Presbyterian, Bethany Presbyterian in Burbank and Palmdale First 
Presbyterian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our congregation feels there is a theological drift in the denomination and 
that this whole controversy touches on the radical feminist agenda," said the 
Rev. Darrell Johnson, senior pastor of Glendale Presbyterian. He plans to 
preach on the issue Sunday morning at the 1,100-member church. 
</P>
<P>
 An associate pastor at Glendale Presbyterian, the Rev. Marsha Roth, added in a 
separate interview: "This is a very teachable moment for the church to 
understand what we believe and what is at stake. Without shared doctrine and 
standards there is no common life of service." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Presbyterian laywoman Joyce Ride, a conference participant from 
Encino, said she took notes at the Minneapolis conference and said she believes 
the ruckus is largely over statements taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
 "While there were some comments that would be alarming, particularly to very 
conservative and not particularly theologically literate people, there were 
also some very profound and thought-provoking presentations," Ride said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went not being afraid of controversial statements because intelligent 
people can take them or leave them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments most cited by critics came from the Rev. Delores Williams, an 
associate professor at Union Theological Seminary in New York, who questioned 
the usefulness of the central Christian doctrine of atonement: that Jesus died 
on the cross to pay for the sins of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 In excerpts quoted by a conservative Methodist magazine, Good News, Williams 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need a theory of atonement at all. I think Jesus came for 
life and to show us something about life and living together and what life was 
all about. Atonement has to do so much . . . I don't think we need folks 
hanging on crosses and blood dripping and weird stuff. . . . Is the image of 
the cross still a powerful, workable image for the churches and women today? . 
. . I think the cross ought to be interpreted for what it was; it was a symbol 
of evil. I mean it is the murder of this man, of an innocent man, a victim." 
</P>
<P>
 A United Methodist participant, the Rev. Nan Self, pastor of University Church 
in Redlands, said that reports of the meeting in church publications and the 
secular press selected inflammatory quotes from the plenary speakers but 
reflected none of the small-group discussions that took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary work of the conference was at tables of 10 people each as these 
groups struggled with, and even refuted sometimes, things said on the 
platform," said Self. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the liturgy (ritual) was not entirely comfortable for me, but it was 
nothing so heinous as to be heresy," said Self, an official for 18 years on the 
United Methodist Commission on the Status and Role of Women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm deeply grieved that conservatives are using the conference as a rallying 
cry to energize the fearful in their denominations," Self said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the controversy was fueled by the fact that Presbyterian and United 
Methodist denominational funds supported the meeting, which was co-sponsored by 
four Minneapolis-St. Paul area church councils in an observance of the World 
Council of Churches' "Ecumenical Decade: Churches in Solidarity with Women." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest contribution to the conference was $66,000 from a Presbyterian 
fund which paid transportation costs for about 20 international speakers and 
participants. The women's division of the United Methodist Church paid $22,000 
in registration fees and travel expenses for 56 officials and staff workers in 
the denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,200 persons attended -- mostly women, and nearly half either 
Presbyterians or Methodists. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the General Assembly Council, the Presbyterians' highest 
policy-making body between annual conventions, declared that no violations of 
church policy occurred but that a review of guidelines and denomination fund 
allocations would be made. The council declined to take action on a proposal to 
review the job performance of Mary Jane Lundy, a Presbyterian official who 
served as liaison to the conference. Lundy has been the primary target of 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 A resolution to disavow the conference, submitted to the Presbytery of San 
Fernando, will not be considered at the San Fernando body's regular meeting 
Tuesday in Encino because it arrived too late, said the Rev. Bob Fernandez, the 
presbytery's top administrator. "We will call for a special meeting on April 
5," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the resolution, identical to one submitted to the Santa Barbara 
Presbytery, would be passed along to the denomination's annual General Assembly 
for further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that even in an ecumenical setting," said Pastor Johnson of 
Glendale Presbyterian, "you have to remain faithful to the center of the faith 
and that is Jesus himself. The leadership of the church has moved way beyond 
that in this conference." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, participant Self, who is 65, said the conference "was the most 
caring, undergirding and nurturing of any that I've ever attended."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FUGITIVE FROM LANCASTER IS SHOT TO DEATH IN 
LOUISIANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Lancaster fugitive who vowed not be taken alive has been shot to death by a 
Louisiana state trooper after he pointed a gun at the officer during a routine 
traffic stop, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Flory, 44, a convicted child molester and a fugitive since Jan. 4, 
was shot five times by Louisiana State Police Trooper Neal Harwell after 
Harwell stopped him for driving a car with expired registration tags, said 
Louisiana state police spokeswoman Barbara Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred Wednesday, north of the small town of St. Joseph, La., 
on U.S. 65. After Flory was stopped on the highway, he walked up to the state 
trooper, who was sitting in his squad car writing a ticket, and pointed a small 
handgun at him, Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flory fired one shot, which ricocheted inside the patrol car but did not hit 
Harwell. The state trooper then fired 11 shots at Flory, authorities said. A 
shotgun was found in Flory's car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Portillo said Flory missed his 
trial date in January at Lancaster Superior Court for the kidnaping and rape of 
a 13-year-old Lake Elizabeth girl. He was convicted of molesting his 
11-year-old daughter in 1984 and spent a year in County Jail, Portillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew he was going to go to jail for a long time because of his previous 
conviction," said Detective Ron Schram of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that Flory left Lancaster in a rented car on Dec. 20. The car 
was found in Las Vegas a few days later.  
</P>
<P>
 Police later learned that Flory had mailed a letter to a former girlfriend 
from New Orleans. In the letter, he stated that he would not be taken alive, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In view of what he did, I think he wanted to end it all," Portillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 After he left California, authorities said Flory was charged with theft for 
stealing $24,000 in cash from his former girlfriend.  
</P>
<P>
 "He knew how to manipulate women," said Schram. "He considered himself a 
romantic."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; AFTERSHOCK-WEARY RESIDENTS TO LAUNCH A 
MESSAGE; COPING: THOUSANDS OF LETTERS WILL BE SENT ALOFT TODAY WITH A HELIUM 
BALLOON IN THE HOPE IT WILL HELP PEOPLE DEAL BETTER WITH CONTINUING TREMORS. 
</P>

<P>
 Don't be fooled if you think efforts to relieve post-earthquake stress here 
are full of hot air. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may look that way today when thousands of letters about aftershocks are 
launched at noon with a 10-foot-tall helium balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall resident Garo Papazian has been gathering notes for a month and hopes 
the "Send a Message to Mother Nature" event helps residents cope with the 
temblors in the wake of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sick and tired of it, but we live in earthquake country, so there's 
nothing we can do," said Papazian, 46. "This is just something that I said, 
'This is what I want to do, I wonder if other people in the city want to?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, they do. Thousands of letters have been pouring in from children 
and adults in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys since Papazian 
distributed 20,000 flyers to Santa Clarita elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Papazian came up with the idea in mid-February, after hearing that a similar 
event had helped a grieving child in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "About a year or so ago, there was a little girl in a car accident with her 
father," Papazian said. "This child psychologist suggested she write a letter 
and send it to her father in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 The release is to occur in front of Papazian's office at 25129 The Old Road in 
Newhall. It has received the support of a Valencia child psychologist and city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children often have difficult times expressing their feelings. You have to 
find a way to release the stress, the tension, the feelings, the anxiety, the 
trauma," said psychologist Joseph Share, who will attend the event and talk 
with children and parents. "It's never absolutely forgotten, but this 
definitely is a release." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing about their fears and then jettisoning them as a group is also 
helpful, Share said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talking about it is OK, but using more of your senses is a better way to go," 
Share said. "Doing this in a large group is like rallying together. If they do 
it and get nothing out of it, they've at least contributed to the community 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have agreed to co-sponsor the event and Mayor George Pederson 
is scheduled to attend, but no public funds are being spent on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our philosophy is, if it would help the kids with the aftermath, then we 
support it," city spokeswoman Gail Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Papazian has hired a pilot to track the balloon. He said instructions and a 
reward have been placed within the bag of letters asking for its return.

 Antelope Valley College is preparing to break ground for its first new 
classroom building in more than two decades, a building that officials said 
will propel the campus into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so exciting," said college President Allan Kurki. "This is what's 
going to make it possible for us to (grow) to 20,000 students." 
</P>
<P>
 The state finance department on Thursday approved $7.5 million for the 
construction of a two-story Applied Arts building at the college. The building 
will include 10 lecture rooms, 24 faculty offices and 16 to 18 laboratories. At 
54,000 square feet, it will be the largest building on the 125-acre campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This new Applied Arts building is really going to provide the classroom space 
we desperately need," Kurki said. "Even for me it's hard to overstate the 
significance of this one." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several years, the college has had an enrollment of about 10,000 
students. If space, and more importantly, funding were available, the number of 
students would increase, Kurki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the college has modified portions of buildings to increase the 
number of classrooms and has also used trailers as temporary rooms to meet 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't schedule as many classes as we'd like to during peak periods early 
in the morning and the evening period," Kurki said. "This (new building) really 
will open up a lot of things for us -- the new technologies, things that are up 
to date." 
</P>
<P>
 Courses in desktop publishing, computer-aided design, television, technical 
illustration/commercial art, journalism, nursing and emergency medicine will be 
offered in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the Applied Arts building may begin as early as June and is 
expected to take 21 months. It is expected to be ready for use in the fall of 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is also expected to fund the $3 million needed to equip the 
building, Kurki said. That money would be approved next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurki described the new building and the proposed 100-acre, 10,000-student 
satellite campus in Palmdale as the college's "big steps." Approval of the 
$100-million second campus, he said, could come from the state as early as 
August.

 UCLA plans -- A story on UCLA's School of Public Health in Friday's Times 
stated that Chancellor Charles E. Young planned to shut down the master's and 
doctoral programs in library studies. Although Young initially proposed those 
closures, UCLA officials say he now has "endorsed a merger of the Graduate 
School of Library and Information Science with the Graduate School of Education 
that preserves the library school's degree programs."

 'Monkey Trouble' -- The review of "Monkey Trouble" in Friday's Calendar 
section characterized the production of the film as sloppy and referred to 
scenes in which a microphone drops into view. In fact, the version of the film 
shown to the reviewer was a rough cut, and was billed as such. The print of the 
film currently in release does not contain those scenes.
